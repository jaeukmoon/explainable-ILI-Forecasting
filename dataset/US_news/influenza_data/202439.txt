Toggle navigation About ASPR Newsroom FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Wednesday, September​ 25, 2024 Contact ASPR Press OfficeASPRMedia@hhs.govaspr.hhs.govewsroomX:@ASPRgov ASPR awards $121.4 million for vaccine influenza pandemic preparedness Funding increases the U.S. government’s stockpile of important vaccine component The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) today announced a $121.4 million agreement with influenza vaccine manufacturer CSL Seqirus to sustainably increase the U.S. government’s stockpile of influenza vaccine adjuvant. “Ensuring the country has access to the tools it needs to respond to pandemic influenza is a key ASPR priority,” said Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O’Connell. “This agreement secures access to a critical component for pandemic influenza vaccines and is an important step towards keeping Americans protected now and in the future.”An adjuvant is an ingredient used in some vaccines that helps create a stronger immune response for people receiving the vaccine, which means that adjuvants can help vaccines work better. Adjuvants have been used safely in vaccines for decades. In addition, adjuvants can allow vaccines to be made with less of the critical vaccine ingredient called antigen. Adding an adjuvant can increase the number of vaccine doses available, called a dose-sparing strategy. This approach aids in protecting more people in an influenza pandemic.Under the agreement announced today, CSL Seqirus will increase the vendor-managed inventory of the MF59 adjuvant that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) previously established with the company, bringing the total to the equivalent of approximately 40 million doses. To maintain a consistent supply of MF59, the adjuvant can be used before it expires in commercial production of the company’s seasonal adjuvanted influenza vaccine and replenished in the vendor-managed inventory. This approach ensures a sustainable, evergreen supply of the adjuvant so that the ingredient is available immediately for pandemic influenza vaccine production when needed.“Made during National Preparedness Month, the award contributes to the nation’s ability to prepare for and respond to future influenza pandemics,” said BARDA Director Gary Disbrow, Ph.D. “This latest addition to our pre-pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing capability is just one example of how we continue to prepare the nation to respond to a variety of national emergencies.BARDA’s U.S. National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) program and CSL Seqirus will work together to oversee the integration of this increased inventory into the overall pre-pandemic influenza response efforts to ensure a highly responsive, flexible, sustainable, scalable, and effective approach to reducing the impact of pandemic influenza viruses. The adjuvant vendor-managed inventory also supports the National Pandemic Strategy. Established in 2005 as part of the Medical Countermeasures for Pandemic Influenza and Emerging Diseases Preparedness and Response Program, the NPIVS program manages the inventory of pre-pandemic influenza vaccines and adjuvants, oversees domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity, and procures vaccines to mitigate the public health impact of emerging disease threats.

(Eradivir photo/Gregory Eakins) September 23, 2024 Steve Martin Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Eradivir, a preclinical biotech company that develops antiviral therapeutics, has completed a $10.25 million Series A funding round. The funding will be used to conduct a Phase 2a challenge study of its EV25 influenza treatment. CEO Martin Low said EV25 consistently outperforms the current standard of care for influenza in preclinical models. “Within 24 hours of taking EV25, the amount of live virus present in preclinical models was reduced to nondetectable amounts,” he said. “The Phase 2a and Phase 2b trials will collectively demonstrate EV25’s safety and efficacy in humans, starting with proof of concept and culminating in a real-world setting.” EV25 was built on a platform created by Philip Low, the Presidential Scholar for Drug Discovery and the Ralph C. Corley Distinguished Professor of Chemistry in Purdue University’s College of Science. Low is part of Purdue’s One Health initiative, which advances the university strengths in human, animal, plant and environmental health. He also is on the faculty of the Purdue Institute for Drug Discovery and the Purdue Institute for Cancer Research. Philip Low is Eradivir’s chief scientific officer and on its board of directors. Philip Low disclosed the immunological innovations to the Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization, which has applied for patents to protect the intellectual property. OTC licensed the innovations to Eradivir for further development and commercialization. Securing the funding Martin Low said raising the Series A round was unique because of the type of investor. Funding was raised with investments from Philip Low, board members and other members of the company. Additional investors were small institutions, friends and family. “Our investors’ agenda aligns well with Phil’s and Purdue’s objectives,” he said. “Some of the proceeds from EV25, and perhaps other assets, will be reinvested in additional molecules discovered and developed at Eradivir and, by extension, Purdue.” Eradivir received $10.8 million in previous funding rounds along with $1 million from the National Science Foundation and the Center for Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority’s (BARDA) Division of Research, Innovation and Ventures. “We are looking to raise another $10 million to reach our targeted inflection point of completing three trials: the Phase 1 SAD (single and multiple ascending dose) study, Phase 2a challenge study and Phase 2b patient study,” Martin Low said. “Our goal is to secure these remaining required funds through nondilutive sources, including BARDA, the Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health.” About Eradivir Eradivir’s goal is to focus the power of the immune system to treat disease. Its small-molecule, bispecific immunotherapy tethers a patient’s immune cells specifically to a diseased cell facilitating its rapid and selective destruction. Its first drug to go into humans, EV25, is directed against influenza.

Using electronic medical records from hospitals and influenza vaccine administration data in Beijing, China, we studied individuals vaccinated between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, who experienced at least one acute cardiovascular event within two years. A self-controlled case series design calculated the relative incidence (RI) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of acute cardiovascular events within one year after vaccination. Among 1647 participants (median age: 65 years, 38.43% female), the risk of events 29–365 days post-vaccination was 0.76 times the baseline level (RI: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.68–0.84). The protective effect was more pronounced in younger participants (P = 0.043) and those without cardiovascular history (P < 0.001), while acute respiratory infection (P = 0.986) and vaccination frequency (P = 0.272) had no impact. Influenza vaccines offer protection against acute cardiovascular events for at least one year, suggesting potential for cardiovascular disease prevention.

Increasing evidence suggests that acute respiratory infections can increase the risk of acute cardiovascular diseases3,4. Influenza vaccination is an effective intervention to prevent acute respiratory infections and reduce their severity5, it could also prevent related cardiovascular complications6. Previous studies have suggested a relationship between influenza vaccination and reduced risk of acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage7,8. Some scientific associations and health regulatory agencies have recommended influenza vaccination to prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular events5,9.Although numerous studies have shown an association between influenza vaccination and reduced risk of cardiovascular events, there is still controversy regarding the results for different populations and types of cardiovascular diseases10,11,12. This may be related to study design, characteristics of the study population, and frequency of vaccine administration. In observational studies, unknown confounding bias and indication bias may affect the reliability of the research; randomized controlled trials have rigorously defined the included populations, leading to potentially different results from real-world research. Additionally, many previous studies exploring the protective effect of vaccines on acute cardiovascular events did not consider the acute respiratory infection as a confounding factor since it is a risk factor for acute cardiovascular events. Self-controlled case series designs use individuals as their own controls to better control for non-time-varying confounders and estimate effects during different exposure periods13,14. However, there are currently few studies based on Chinese population using this type of research design to explore the protective effects of influenza vaccines on cardiovascular events.Acute respiratory infections could increase the risk of acute cardiovascular events, regardless of whether individuals have underlying cardiovascular diseases15. Influenza vaccination, as a cost-effective measure to prevent acute respiratory infections, may have significant potential in preventing cardiovascular diseases. In order to more effectively reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, this study aims to provide more evidence on the association between influenza vaccination and cardiovascular events, and clarify how this association changes over time.MethodsEthicsThe study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Pecking Union Medical College, Beijing, China (CAMS&PUMC-IEC-2022-019, March 14 2022) and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. The need for informed consent was waived by the ethics committee because the study utilized de-identified hospitalization data collected as part of routine clinical practice. The waiver was granted based on the minimal risk posed to participants by the research and impracticality of obtaining consent due to the retrospective nature of the study.Data sourceThe study utilized influenza vaccine vaccination records in Beijing from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018 obtained from the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Additionally, electronic medical records for hospitalizations in Beijing from 2012 to 2020 were linked from the Beijing Municipal Health Big Data and Policy Research Center, a citywide hospital admission surveillance system in Beijing, China16,17. Due to incomplete vaccination data for residents from other provinces, the study population was limited to permanent residents of Beijing (identified based on basic medical insurance information in hospitalization data).Study designThe self-controlled case series study (SCCS) was conducted. The exposure factor was influenza vaccination, and the outcome of interest was acute cardiovascular events. The time of influenza vaccination was taken as the start point of the observation period, and hospital admission time of acute cardiovascular events was considered as the occurrence time of the disease. The observation period was defined as follows: from the day of influenza vaccination (day 0) until 730 days thereafter. Since protective antibodies from influenza vaccine typically develop 2–4 weeks after vaccination18,19, and influenza vaccine is usually administered once a year, this study defined the exposure period as follows: from day 29 after influenza vaccination to 365 days thereafter. The control period was defined as the observation period excluding the exposure period; i.e., 0–28 days and 366–730 days after influenza vaccination. This method for dividing time intervals is similar to that used in a previous study20.According to previous research, acute respiratory infections are risk factors for acute cardiovascular events21,22; therefore, this study also considered acute respiratory infections occurring after vaccine administration but before outcome events as confounding exposure factors with an exposure window set at post-infection day 0-3654. The schematic diagram of the observation period is shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1: The observation period of the self-controlled case series study.A 2-year observation period was established, with the first year after influenza vaccination as the exposure period and the second year after influenza vaccination as the control period.Full size imageIn order to minimize potential confounding factors, such as the impact of COVID-19 vaccines, this study focused on analyzing hospital records dated prior to December 31, 2020. Consequently, the administration of influenza vaccinations was restricted to dates before December 31, 2018 to ensure a complete two-year observation period for each individual in the self-controlled case series analysis. Given that influenza vaccination is typically received annually, it was assumed that the protective effect of influenza vaccines would diminish to baseline levels in the second year if individuals did not receive another influenza vaccination during the two-year observation period. Inclusion criteria were: (1) receipt of influenza vaccination between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018, without receiving subsequent influenza vaccinations within two years; (2) occurrence of at least one acute cardiovascular event within two years after receiving influenza vaccination. Exclusion criteria were: (1) retention of the first record if an individual had multiple vaccination records meeting the above conditions; (2) exclusion of individuals aged below 18 years. The inclusion and exclusion flowchart is shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2: Flow chart for inclusion and exclusion of participants in the study.Participants were individuals who had been vaccinated between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, and had experienced at least one acute cardiovascular event within two years.Full size imageFor patients who experienced multiple acute cardiovascular events during the observation period, due to potential associations between these events, this study considered the time of occurrence of the first acute cardiovascular event during the observation period as the time point for analysis.Exposure and outcomesThe exposure factor was influenza vaccination. China has licensed trivalent (IIV3) and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4), including split-virus vaccine, whole-virus vaccines, and subunit vaccine. The specific types of vaccines utilized during the study seasons were shown in Supplementary Table 1. All licensed influenza vaccines contain strains recommended for the northern hemisphere by the World Health Organization (https://www.who.inteams/global-influenza-programme/vaccines/who-recommendations; http://www.chinacdc.cn/en/). The Supplementary Table 2 presented the influenza vaccine strains, circulating strains, predominant circulating strains, and the concordance between vaccine strains and circulating strains for the 2015–2016 to 2018–2019 influenza seasons.The outcome event was the acute cardiovascular event, which was identified through discharge diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Acute cardiovascular events include acute myocardial infarction, stroke, acute myocarditis, acute pericarditis, and other acute cardiovascular diseases. Chronic or subacute diseases such as cerebral infarction (I63.903) and chronic ischemic heart disease (I25) were not included. Detailed disease codes are provided in Supplementary Table 3.Regarding the vaccination status of influenza vaccine, if a patient’s influenza vaccination record is not matched, it indicates that the patient has not been vaccinated against influenza or has been vaccinated outside of Beijing City. Since this study limited the study population to patients with Beijing medical insurance, the possibility of receiving vaccinations outside of Beijing is low. Therefore, this study considers patients who did not have a matched influenza vaccination record as not having received an influenza vaccine.Other factorsAcute respiratory infection was considered another exposure factor due to its intricate association with acute cardiovascular events21,22. In this study, the causative agents of acute respiratory infection could not be determined due to unavailable data for laboratory diagnosis. Therefore, the scope of acute respiratory infection in this study includes not only influenza infections but also acute upper respiratory tract infections (ICD-10: J00-J06) and lower respiratory tract infections (ICD-10: J09-J18, J20-J22), which were identified through discharge diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). This study also took into account the seasonal factors, which we divided into four groups: spring (March 21–June 21), summer (June 22–September 22), autumn (September 23-December 21), and winter (December 22–March 20 of the next year). The medical history information of the study population was obtained from previous hospital records, specifically all hospitalization records from 2012 to the onset of the first acute cardiovascular event during the observation period. The medical history information includes cardiovascular diseases (ischemic heart disease and stroke), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic lower respiratory diseases, ulcers, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer. The ICD-10 diagnostic codes for these diseases can be found in Supplementary Table 3.Statistical methodsBasic characteristics of participants were described according to the type of acute cardiovascular events. Continuous variables and categorical variables were described using median (quartiles) and frequency (percentage), respectively. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and chi-square test were used for inter-group differences comparison. In addition, the study also provided a characterization and comparison of patients with different cardiovascular disease histories.This study conducted an analysis of overall acute cardiovascular events and their subtypes (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and others). The analysis of subtypes of acute cardiovascular diseases was based on patients with a discharge diagnosis that only included that type of acute cardiovascular disease; patients with multiple types of events occurring simultaneously were excluded. If a patient had multiple hospitalizations for acute respiratory infections within 45 days, the multiple hospitalizations were considered as one episode of acute respiratory infection, and the time of the first admission was taken as the onset time of the disease. The same data processing method was applied to acute cardiovascular events.We utilized the standard SCCS model and adjusted for acute respiratory infection factors and seasonal effects to calculate the relative incidence (RI) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of acute cardiovascular events during the exposure period (vaccination days 29–365) compared to baseline (vaccination days 0–28, 366–730), as well as RIs of acute cardiovascular events during different time windows within the exposure period (29–84 days, 85–168 days, 169–252 days, 253–365 days). The study also investigated the protective effect of influenza vaccination on acute cardiovascular events within one year among individuals with different cardiovascular disease histories, and its variation over time.This study conducted a stratified analysis of the protective effect of influenza vaccine, using age, gender, underlying diseases, and occurrence of acute respiratory infections as stratification factors. Likelihood ratio tests were used to explore potential interactions between influenza vaccine administration and these factors. Additionally, to investigate the impact of multiple inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) immunizations on the prevention of acute cardiovascular events, we categorized individuals based on whether they had received another influenza vaccination within one year prior to the observation period. If an individual had received another influenza vaccination within one year before the current vaccination, they would be classified as having received multiple vaccinations; otherwise, they would be classified as having received a single vaccination. Since only data for influenza vaccination records after September 1, 2015 are available, the earliest start time for the observation period was set to one year later, specifically September 1, 2016.To ensure the robustness of the results, sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) not adjusting for acute respiratory infections; (2) building models for different influenza seasons separately; (3) excluding patients who experienced both acute respiratory infections and acute cardiovascular events during the same hospitalization; (4) excluding patients who died from acute cardiovascular events during hospitalization. Furthermore, we extended the observation period to three years to investigate the impact of IIV immunity beyond 1 year. The exposure period was defined as 29–730 days after vaccination, and the control period was defined as 0–28 days and 731–1095 days after vaccination. Only individuals who received the influenza vaccination between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017, and did not receive any subsequent vaccinations within three years were included in the analysis.Data analysis was conducted using SAS software (version 9.4), R software (version 4.2.3), and RStudio (version 2023.12.0). The SCCS model was constructed using the “SCCS” package in R. All statistical tests were two-sided with a significance level set at 0.05.ResultsCharacteristics of participantsAs shown in Table 1, a total of 1647 participants were included in this study. Among them, there were 209 (10.67%) patients with myocardial infarction, 600 (42.62%) with ischemic stroke, 68 (2.99%) with hemorrhagic stroke, and 16 (2.13%) with two or more types of the aforementioned acute cardiovascular events, while 754 (41.60%) had other acute cardiovascular events. The median age (Q1–Q3) of participants was 65.00 (56.00–73.00) years. Males accounted for 61.57% and females accounted for 38.43%. During the observation period and at the time of acute cardiovascular events occurrence, a total of 13.05% patients experienced acute respiratory tract infections. In the overall study population, 75.47% had a history of cardiovascular disease. Detailed basic information of participants is provided in Table 1. To demonstrate the timing of influenza vaccination in relation to cardiovascular events among participants, a centered plot14 is also drawn (Supplementary Fig. 1).Table 1 Characteristics of participants grouped by types of acute cardiovascular eventsFull size tableProtective effect of influenza vaccines on acute cardiovascular eventsThe protective effect of influenza vaccination on acute cardiovascular events within 1 year is shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4. The risk of acute cardiovascular events occurring 29–365 days after influenza vaccination was 0.76 times the baseline level (0–28 days and 366-730 days post-vaccination) with a RI of 0.76 and a 95% CI of 0.68–0.84. The RIs and 95% CIs for days 29–84 being 0.86 (0.70–1.06), days 85-168 being 0.83 (0.69–0.98), days 169–252 being 0.67 (0.55–0.81), and days 253–365 being 0.73 (0.62–0.86).Fig. 3: Relative incidence of acute cardiovascular events within one year following influenza vaccination.A Relative incidence for all acute cardiovascular events among participants with different status of underlying cardiovascular diseases. B Relative incidence for different types of acute cardiovascular events.Full size imageAs shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4, in individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease, the RI and its 95% CI of overall acute cardiovascular events for days 29–84, days 85–168, days 169–252, and days 253–365 were 1.09 (0.87–1.35), 0.96 (0.79–1.17), 0.76 (0.62–0.95), and 0.79 (0.66–0.96) respectively; while in individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease, the RI and its 95% CI for different time periods were 0.28 (0.15–0.53), 0.49 (0.33–0.73), 0.45 (0.30–0.67), and 0.57 (0.40–0.80). The average RI and its 95% CI for individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease and those without cardiovascular disease at days 29–365 were 0.88 (0.78–0.99) and 0.47 (0.38–0.59), respectively.Protective effect against different types of acute cardiovascular eventsThe influenza vaccine has a protective effect on both ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction events within one year (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4). From day 29 to 365 after vaccination, the average risk of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction decreased by 42% and 26%, respectively compared to the baseline period, with RIs and their 95% CIs being 0.58 (0.49–0.69) and 0.74 (0.55–0.99). Taking ischemic stroke as an example, the RI and its 95% CI from days 29 to 84, days 85 to 168, days 169 to 252, days 253 to 365 were 0.55 (0.37–0.83), 0.61 (0.45–0.84), 0.55 (0.40–0.75), and 0.59 (0.45–0.78) respectively. For other types of acute cardiovascular events, due to the small sample size, the confidence intervals are all wide (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4).Stratification analysisStratification factors, including age (<60 years, ≥60 years), gender, history of cardiovascular disease, chronic lower respiratory tract disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, cancer prior to the observation period, acute respiratory infection, and the vaccination frequency were considered (Table 2). The protective effect of influenza vaccine is greater in individuals under 60 years old (RI: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.55–0.78) than those aged 60 and above (RI: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.72–0.93). Furthermore, it was found to be more effective in individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease (RI: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.38–0.60) in comparison to those with such a history (RI: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.78–0.98). The study also revealed better protection in individuals without a history of chronic lower respiratory tract diseases (P = 0.002) or kidney disease (P = 0.002). Additionally, evidence did not show any impact on the protective effect of influenza vaccine from acute respiratory infections (P = 0.986).Table 2 Stratification analysis for the association between influenza vaccines and acute cardiovascular eventsaFull size tableIn the analysis investigating the impact of vaccination frequency on the prevention of acute cardiovascular events, it was found that the protective effect of multiple vaccination (RI: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.67–1.15) was weaker than that of single vaccination (RI: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.66–0.82). However, no interaction effect between influenza vaccine administration and vaccination frequency was observed (P = 0.272) (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 5).Sensitivity analysisTo assess the stability of the results, this study conducted the following sensitivity analysis: not adjusting for acute respiratory infection factors; analyzing different influenza seasons separately; excluding patients who experienced acute respiratory infections and acute cardiovascular events during the same hospitalization period; and excluding patients who died from acute cardiovascular events during hospitalization. The results of sensitivity analysis are consistent with the main analysis results, as shown in Table 3. In addition, to demonstrate the timing and frequency of influenza vaccination among patients with cardiovascular events, we used cardiovascular events as the inclusion criteria and examined their influenza vaccination status (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Table 7).Table 3 Sensitivity analysis for the relative incidence (RI) of acute cardiovascular events following influenza vaccinationFull size tableIn the analysis exploring the impact of IIV immunity beyond one year, a total of 1360 participants were included (Supplementary Table 8). The results suggest that the protective effect of influenza vaccination on acute cardiovascular events may persist for at least two years. In individuals without a history of cardiovascular diseases, a decline in this protective effect was observed over time (Supplementary Table 9).DiscussionThe influenza vaccine is a cost-effective strategy for preventing acute respiratory infections and reducing their severity. There exists a complex relationship between acute respiratory infections and acute cardiovascular events, with evidence suggesting that the influenza vaccine also holds great potential for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease15,23. This study aimed to investigate the potential relationship between influenza vaccine and cardiovascular events and provide data support for optimizing strategies for preventing and controlling cardiovascular diseases, a self-controlled case series study based on hospitalization data from Beijing, China, was conducted. The findings revealed that individuals who received the influenza vaccine experienced a 24% reduction in their risk of developing acute cardiovascular events within one year; this protective effect was even more significant among individuals without a history of cardiovascular diseases.This study has revealed the protective effect of influenza vaccines on acute cardiovascular events. Previous studies have also suggested that influenza vaccines can prevent cardiovascular diseases6. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed that influenza vaccines can reduce major adverse cardiovascular events by 13% in individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease24. Another SCCS study demonstrated a 27% reduction in hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease among heart failure patients who received influenza vaccines6. Our study did not find any differences in the protective effect of the vaccine over different time periods within 1 year, while another similar study indicated a gradual decline in vaccine effectiveness over time6. This may be due to the relatively small sample size of our study, leading to wider confidence intervals for estimates of effects at different time points, making it difficult to detect subtle differences between time periods. Furthermore, our findings also indicated that the protective impact of multiple vaccinations was less pronounced compared to single vaccination. This observation is consistent with previous studies which have shown that repeated influenza vaccination attenuate effectiveness25.This study investigated the association between influenza vaccination and acute cardiovascular events, while considering the relationship between acute respiratory infections and acute cardiovascular events. We included acute respiratory infection as an additional exposure factor in addition to influenza vaccination in the model. The findings revealed that the factor of acute respiratory infection essentially does not impact the effect value of influenza vaccine immunization. In order to confirm this conclusion, a stratified analysis based on whether there was an acute respiratory infection before the acute cardiovascular event during the observation period was conducted, along with a likelihood ratio test. The results also showed no statistical difference between the two. According to prior research, it is possible that the association between influenza vaccine and cardiovascular disease may even be stronger than its association with respiratory infections6,26. During the observation period of this study, the most frequently detected pathogens were Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, influenza A virus, human rhinovirus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae27,28. This suggests that the protective mechanism of influenza vaccine against acute cardiovascular events may not solely be achieved through preventing or reducing severe cases of influenza infections but could also be related to non-specific protective effects of vaccines29. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the protective effect of influenza vaccines on cardiovascular events, independent of their role in preventing influenza infection. For instance, influenza vaccination may activate the immune system, and modulation of immune responses to chronic inflammation could contribute to the cardiovascular benefits observed30,31. In addition, influenza vaccination may help stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, thereby reducing the likelihood of plaque rupture and subsequent cardiovascular complications32. It is important to note that due to limitations in sample size, particularly for those who had an acute respiratory infection before experiencing an acute cardiovascular event; further validation is still necessary in future studies regarding whether such infections affect the protective effect of influenza vaccine.This study discovered that the influenza vaccine provides significant protection against myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke among various acute cardiovascular events. However, no association was found between the influenza vaccine and hemorrhagic stroke or other acute cardiovascular events. Several previous studies have confirmed the protective effect of the influenza vaccine on myocardial infarction. For instance, a 14-year cohort study using a case-control design to explore the preventive effect of influenza vaccine on myocardial infarction in elderly individuals found that the vaccine can reduce the risk of myocardial infarction by 39%33. A meta-analysis based on a self-controlled case series study showed that within 4 weeks of receiving the influenza vaccine, there is a 16% reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction7. However, there is still controversy regarding the association between influenza vaccine and stroke. Some studies have reported that influenza vaccines significantly reduce the risk of ischemic stroke and show a trend of protection against hemorrhagic stroke34, while another study indicated that they have little protective effect on strokes in middle-aged individuals8. This difference may be due to variances in pathogenesis between myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular disease.The history of cardiovascular disease is a significant factor that influences the protective effect of vaccines. We found that in individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease, the protective effect is significantly higher compared to those with such a history. However, previous studies have produced inconsistent results regarding the modifying effects of cardiovascular disease history3,35,36. This may be influenced by various factors such as study design, follow-up time, and inclusion criteria. The limited protective effect of vaccines on individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease can be attributed to the compromised immunity37. Additionally, when patients with a history of cardiovascular disease are hospitalized for certain diseases (such as acute respiratory infections), clinicians may give special attention and timely intervention using antiviral drugs and cardiovascular medications to prevent adverse outcomes38. Furthermore, the findings of this study are based on a self-controlled design, in which the relative incidence rate of events during the exposure period and baseline period for individuals was calculated. However, it did not take into account differences between individuals14,39. Considering that patients with a history of cardiovascular disease have a higher risk of acute cardiovascular events40, individuals with pre-existing heart conditions remain primary focus for intervention through influenza vaccination. Their immunization may have significant implications for public health.Currently, there is limited evidence regarding the duration of the protective effect of influenza vaccine on cardiovascular events. A study utilizing a self-controlled case series design found that the protective effect of influenza vaccine against acute myocardial infarction can last for 60 days20. Another self-controlled case series study investigated the protective effect of influenza vaccine on various etiologies of hospitalization, including cardiovascular diseases, respiratory system diseases, and all-cause hospitalization, and found that the protective effect can last for 300 days, 120 days, and 150 days respectively6. Our study demonstrated the protective effect of influenza vaccination on acute cardiovascular events within one-year post-vaccination and we found no decline in vaccine effectiveness over time. The sensitivity analysis of our study suggested that the protective effect of influenza vaccination on acute cardiovascular events may persist for at least two years. The duration of protection may vary in different age groups due to factors such as immunosenescence affecting older individuals or those with multiple comorbidities leading to inadequate immune response following vaccination. Further exploration should be conducted through real-world studies to determine the precise duration of the protective effect of influenza vaccine. If a waning protective effect is confirmed, optimized vaccination strategies such as semi-annual or high-dose vaccinations may be an important solution. These strategies have been shown to have greater advantages in reducing influenza virus infection41,42 and related hospitalizations for respiratory system diseases and all causes43.There are several limitations in this study. Firstly, the study population comprised hospitalized individuals in Beijing, predominantly elderly, which may impact the representativeness of the population. Secondly, the exclusion of patients who have been revaccinated within two years may introduce selection bias. The population choosing a single dose may differ systematically from those receiving multiple doses in terms of health status, awareness, and lifestyle. However, we have conducted an analysis to compare the protective effect of multiple vaccination with that of single vaccination and found no statistically significant difference. Therefore, the exclusion of revaccinated individuals may not impact the generalizability of the results. Thirdly, the sample size is relatively small, especially when analyzing different types of cardiovascular events separately, potentially affecting the accuracy of the results. Furthermore, despite employing a self-controlled case series design for analysis, potential confounding factors such as the vaccination of pneumococcal vaccines may still influence the findings.The study revealed an association between influenza vaccination and a reduced risk of acute cardiovascular events, regardless of individuals’ history of cardiovascular disease. This highlights the potential for influenza vaccination as both a primary and secondary prevention strategy for cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the study found that the protective effect of influenza vaccination against acute cardiovascular events can last for at least 1 year.

If confirmed, the cases would mark the first instance of human-to-human H5N1 transmission in the country. At least one household member and six healthcare workers who encountered the index case-patient are being investigated after showing symptoms of viral infection. A week ago, the CDC noted that only two healthcare workers who had contact with the Missouri patient had symptoms.So far 14 human H5N1 cases have been reported in the United States this year, most all but one in agricultural workers who were in close contact with infected cattle. All patients have recovered, but the Missouri patient was hospitalized for his or her illness. Healthcare contact before droplet precautionsSome of the healthcare workers came into contact with the Missouri patient before droplet protocols were in place. Though symptoms have now resolved, the CDC said they would use antibody tests to determine if any of the healthcare workers had the virus. To date, only one case of influenza A(H5N1) has been detected in Missouri. No contacts of that case have tested positive for influenza A(H5N1)."Results of serology testing at CDC on the positive case and their previously identified household contact are still pending," the CDC said. "To date, only one case of influenza A(H5N1) has been detected in Missouri. No contacts of that case have tested positive for influenza A(H5N1)." COVID numbers decline slightly across US; RSV, flu activity low News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 Influenza, General Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) In several weekly updates published today, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said seasonal influenza and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) activity are low nationally, and COVID-19 activity is elevated but declining.The test-positivity percentage for COVID-19 dropped to 11.6% last week from 13.4 % the prior week, according to the weekly update for the week ending on September 21.Other COVID indicators declined as well, but only slightly. Emergency department visits dropped from 1.7% to 1.4%, and hospitalizations per 100,000 population dropped to 4.0, down from the prior week's 4.1. In its biweekly variant update, the CDC noted that the KP.3.1.1 Omicron subvariant accounts for 52.7% of infections, the same as 2 weeks ago.Wastewater levels for COVID-19 remain high but low for RSV and influenza. Of flu cases identified through specimens testing, the H1N1 strain accounts for 53.5% of cases, H3N2 for 46.5%, and influenza B for 1.2%. Influenza test positivity for the week ending on September 21 was 0.6%.Outpatient respiratory illness visits also remained steady, at 1.9%.Of note, the CDC recorded no new human infections with novel influenza A viruses, with the season's total remaining at 23. Very low vaccine uptakeAccording to the CDC, the early weeks of flu vaccine availability have resulted in 9.6% adults reporting receipt of a flu vaccine and 4.5% of adults reporting receipt of the updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccineAmong adults 75 years and older, 34.0% reported ever receiving an RSV vaccine. WHO notes change to 2025 Southern Hemisphere flu vaccine makeup News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Influenza Vaccines golfcphoto/iStock The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced the flu vaccine strain recommendations from its advisory group for the Southern Hemisphere's 2025 season. The WHO makes these recommendations twice yearly, once for each hemisphere, and they are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop flu vaccines for the following influenza season, the WHO said. "The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, including those circulating and infecting humans," the WHO said.New H3N2 strain Mimicking last year's recommendation, the WHO recommends manufacturers produce trivalent (three-strain) vaccines for use in the 2025 Southern Hemisphere influenza season, given that one of the influenza B strains used in quadrivalent (four-strain) vaccines hasn't been detected in years. The 2009 H1N1 recommendations remain the same as last year's, as do the B/Victoria lineage recommendations, but the H3N2 component has changed.For egg-based vaccines, the experts recommend an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Croatia/10136RV/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. For cell-culture vaccines, they recommend an A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/District of Columbia/27/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.For quadrivalent vaccines, the recommendation is unchanged from last year, a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses.The recommendations today do not deviate from the WHO's February recommendations for Northern Hemisphere flu vaccines. Quick takes: US measles outbreak slows, mpox vaccine for Africa, more polio News brief Jim Wappes Topics Measles Mpox Polio In its weekly update today, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed just 2 new measles cases, raising the national total to 264. The previous week saw 11 new cases. Among the case-patients, 88% were unvaccinated or their vaccine status was unknown, and 41% of the total were hospitalized. Seventy-three percent of patients were 19 years or younger, with 42% under age 5 years. The CDC has tracked 13 outbreaks that account for 70% of cases.Bavarian Nordic yesterday announced an agreement with UNICEF to supply 1 million doses of Jynneos mpox vaccine this year for African nations affected by mpox. UNICEF said the vaccine will be available at the lowest market price for 77 low- and lower-middle–income countries. The agreement includes the 500,000 doses that Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, committed to earlier this month. Bavarian Nordic President and CEO Paul Chaplin, PhD, said the agreement "represents a significant contribution to the global efforts to combat the mpox outbreak in Africa." In related news, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says it has received pledges of $814 million in support of mpox response efforts, a number that could top $1 billion, according to Reuters.The Global Polio Eradication Initiative yesterday in its weekly update noted 10 new polio cases in three countries: Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Nigeria. Pakistan confirmed four cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Balochistan, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, for 21 total WPV1 cases this year. That compares with 6 for all of last year. The DRC had 2 circulating vaccine-derived type 2 (cVDPV2) cases in Maindombe province, raising its 2024 total to 12. And Nigeria recorded 4 cVDPV2 cases in Borno, Gombe, and Yobe states, raising its total for the year to 57 cases.

Scientists at Brigham and Women’s Hospital have developed a spray which provides broad-spectrum protection from respiratory infections by COVID-19, influenza, everyday cold viruses, and pneumonia-causing bacteria. This may reduce respiratory diseases and safeguard public health if it can be validated in humans. Dr Jeffrey Karp, co-senior author and distinguished chair in anaesthesiology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, commented: “The COVID pandemic showed us what respiratory pathogens can do to humanity in a very short time. That threat hasn’t gone away…Not only do we have the flu to deal with seasonally, but we now have COVID, too.” Although influenza and COVID-19 vaccines are beneficial, they are not perfect, as vaccinated individuals can still become infected and spread this infection to others. Furthermore, masks are not perfect either: they leak, and people wear them improperly, or choose not to wear them entirely. Therefore, new methods to reduce transmission of the disease are required. PCANS The new study describes the team’s work to create a nasal spray, named Pathogen Capture and Neutralizing Spray (PCANS) to defend against airborne respiratory illness. PCANS was created using ingredients from the FDA’s Inactive Ingredient Database (IID), “which have been previously used in approved nasal sprays, or from the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) list of the FDA,” detailed co-senior author Dr Nitin Joshi, assistant professor of anaesthesiology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. He added: “We developed a drug-free formulation using these compounds to block germs in three ways — PCANS forms a gel-like matrix that traps respiratory droplets, immobilises the germs, and effectively neutralises them, preventing infection.” In a 3D-printed replica of a human nose, the researchers studied the formulation’s ability to capture respiratory droplets. They observed that when sprayed in the nasal cavity replica, PCANS captured twice as many droplets as mucus alone. Dr John Joseph, primary author and a former postdoctoral fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, stated: “PCANS forms a gel, increasing its mechanical strength by a hundred times, forming a solid barrier…It blocked and neutralised almost 100 percent of all viruses and bacteria we tested, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV, adenovirus, K Pneumonia and more.” Exceptional efficacy When tested in mice, it was shown that one dose of the PCANS nasal spray could effectively block infection from an influenza virus (PR8) at 25 times the lethal dose. Virus levels in the lungs were reduced by >99.99 percent, and the inflammatory cells and cytokines in the lungs of PCANS-treated animals were normal. “In a rigorous mouse model study, prophylactic treatment with PCANS demonstrated exceptional efficacy, with treated mice exhibiting complete protection, while the untreated group showed no such benefit,” said Dr Yohannes Tesfaigzi, co-senior author and AstraZeneca Professor of Medicine in the Field of Respiratory and Inflammatory Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Despite the study lacking experiments of PCANS in humans, it offers a solid foundation for future research. Moving forward, the team are investigating whether PCANS can also block allergens. This study was published in Advanced Materials.

Study: Wastewater Surveillance for Influenza A Virus and H5 Subtype Concurrent with the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Outbreak in Cattle and Poultry and Associated Human Cases — United States, May 12–July 13, 2024. Image credit: AU USAnakul / Shutterstock A recent study published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report summarized data from early wastewater surveillance of the influenza A virus and the H5 subtype in the United States (US). Wastewater surveillance helps monitor pathogen shedding by humans at a community level. It is independent of testing access, care-seeking behavior, and symptoms. However, current testing methods cannot distinguish between viral particles shed by humans and those from animals, which introduces complexities in interpreting results. Wastewater surveillance of the influenza virus has been performed for years at some sites, and its findings correlate with conventional surveillance measures. Animal-Related Sources: Over 60% of H5 detections were linked to animal inputs such as dairy operations and milk-processing plants, complicating the interpretation of whether infections were from human or animal origins. The zoonotic outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus in the US has led to 13 confirmed human cases between January and August 2024. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and health departments implemented wastewater surveillance of the influenza A virus and the H5 subtype. While this surveillance is valuable, it is important to note that the H5 detections in wastewater might not specifically indicate HPAI A(H5N1) virus but could reflect low pathogenic avian influenza viruses. About the study The present study summarized data from the first nine weeks of wastewater surveillance of influenza A and the H5 subtype in the US. Wastewater samples were collected from around 750 sites between May 12 and July 13, 2024, and tested for influenza A virus by health departments, CDC contractors, or an academic partner program (WastewaterSCAN). Viral concentrations in wastewater were quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Influenza A virus levels were categorized into five groups: minimal (< 20th percentile), low (20th to 40th percentile), moderate (40th to 60th percentile), above average (60th to 80th percentile), or high (> 80th percentile). Among the sites where high levels of influenza A were detected, a correlation was often found with community human influenza activity based on other surveillance systems. A digital PCR assay for the H5 hemagglutinin gene was evaluated by WastewaterSCAN, which detected H5 RNA in samples from cattle outbreak locations. As such, routine H5 testing was implemented in May 2024 at 193 sites in 41 states. H5 virus data were submitted from July 2024 onwards to CDC's Data Collation and Integration for Public Health Event Response pipeline. It is important to emphasize that while wastewater testing can detect influenza viruses, the results do not definitively indicate whether the viruses originated from human or animal sources. Findings Among 41 states with wastewater testing, nine states (Colorado, California, Iowa, Idaho, Michigan, North Carolina, Minnesota, Texas, and South Dakota) reported one or more H5 detections between May 12 and July 13, 2024. Seven of these nine states reported an HPAI A(H5N1) virus-infected herd during this time, and one reported before it. Further, human HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection cases were confirmed in Michigan and Colorado during this period. Influenza A virus and H5 subtype testing in wastewater and sites with high levels* of influenza A virus or H5 detections reported to CDC — United States, May 12–July 13, 2024 Among the 32 states with no H5 detections, 30 had no HPAI A(H5N1) virus-infected herds during this period, but two had before this period. About 63% of sites with H5 detections identified animal inputs within the county or sewer shed, while 33% identified milk-processing inputs within the sewer shed catchment area. This suggests that many H5 detections could be linked to animal waste rather than human cases. Other inputs were dairy operations, meat processing, wild bird inputs, domestic poultry farms, and other sources of livestock waste. Conclusions Taken together, most wastewater sites in the US did not have high levels of influenza A virus or any H5 detections between May 12 and July 13, 2024. At sites with high levels of influenza A virus, corresponding human influenza activity was frequently detected in the community, reinforcing the correlation between wastewater signals and traditional influenza surveillance systems. At sites with H5 detections, almost all were in a state with reported infection of dairy herds before or during the surveillance period. Further, animal-related inputs were frequently reported among sites with H5 detections. Despite this, the current testing methods cannot distinguish between human and animal sources of the virus, complicating the interpretation of H5 detections. Notably, while influenza viruses can be detected in wastewater, existing methods cannot differentiate between animal and human sources, and the current testing approach for H5 was not HPAI A(H5N1) virus-specific. As such, wastewater H5 detections might reflect animal infections. In addition, there is limited information about the proportion of infected humans shedding influenza viruses in feces or urine and how viral shedding varies across the course of illness and by subtype. Overall, data from these early investigations of wastewater signals can aid health officials in implementing improved measures of viral levels in wastewater and optimizing wastewater surveillance in the next respiratory illness season. This highlights the importance of a "One Health" approach, where public health, agriculture, wildlife, and environmental sectors collaborate to fully understand and manage zoonotic influenza outbreaks.

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) continues to be a concern as the fall migration season begins, and it is important for bird owners to increase biosecurity practices and remain vigilant in monitoring their birds’ health. HPAI is a highly contagious virus that can be spread directly by infected wild birds/animals or indirectly through any items that have come into contact with the virus such as equipment, vehicles, feed and the clothing and shoes of animal caretakers. Implementing biosecurity practices can help reduce the risk of exposure and infection. Michigan State University Extension suggests the following on farm practices: Prevent contact in between wild birds and domestic birds Removing standing water Fencing off natural ponds and vegetative areas around barns and pasture/free ranging areas Reducing food sources for wild birds Covering animal carcasses Plugging holes where wild birds can obtain access into and out of coops Removing wild bird perching areas Implement on farm biosecurity practices Wear clean clothing and footwear while caring for animals Practice good personal hygiene by frequently washing hands with soap and hot water Regularly clean and disinfect tools and equipment used on the farm Limit farm visitors: if service professionals must come on the farm, identify a specific area for parking away from animal housing and provide visitors with disposable foot coverings Do not visit neighboring flocks. If you must, wear different clothing and footwear than you wear with your flock Limit exposure to your flock from anyone who has had contact with other flocks of birds or infected cattle. Keep a visitor log that includes date individuals visited your flock and their contact information Separate, or ideally isolate, any newly acquired animals for a minimum of 14 days and monitor new animals for signs of illness Know the signs and symptoms of illness Care for new, separated, isolated or sick animals last To create a comprehensive farm biosecurity plan, visit the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Defend the Flock resource center for more information and detailed biosecurity checklists. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, birds infected with HPAI may exhibit one or more of the following symptoms: Lack of coordination Low energy or appetite Purple discoloration or swelling of the head, comb, wattles, eyelids, and/or hocks Reduced egg production, or soft-shelled/misshapen eggs Nasal discharge, coughing, or sneezing Diarrhea Sudden death with no prior signs The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) notes that HPAI is not evidenced by one bird showing symptoms or dying while the remaining flock continues acting normally. Small flock and backyard poultry owners should take notice when two or more birds die within a 24-hour period and the rest of the flock is exhibiting symptoms of HPAI. Bird owners should contact MDARD if they suspect an HPAI infection in birds at 1-800-292-3939 (daytime) or 517-373-0440 (after-hours). If unusual or unexplained wild birds deaths are noticed, cases should be reported to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources by using the DNR’s Eyes in the Field app, choose the “Diseased Wildlife” option in the “Observation Forms,” or by calling the DNR Wildlife Disease Laboratory at 517-336-5030. Properly prepared and cooked poultry products remain safe to consume. The chance of infected poultry or egg products entering the food chain is extremely low due to the rapid onset of symptoms of HPAI and the USDA flock monitoring and inspection safeguards that are in place.

The announcement was made at an information session after a 4-day meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines. The meeting is held twice annually, once for the southern and once for the northern hemisphere. WHO organizes these consultations with an advisory group of experts gathered from WHO Collaborating Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories to analyse influenza virus surveillance data generated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The recommendations issued are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce, and license influenza vaccines for the following influenza season. The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, including those circulating and infecting humans.The WHO recommends that trivalent vaccines for use in the 2025 southern hemisphere influenza season contain the following: Egg-based vaccines an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;an A/Croatia/10136RV/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.Cell culture-, recombinant protein- or nucleic acid-based vaccinesan A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;an A/District of Columbia/27/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.The recommendation for the B/Yamagata lineage component of quadrivalent influenza vaccines remains unchanged from previous recommendations:a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.

The WHO makes these recommendations twice yearly, once for each hemisphere, and they are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop flu vaccines for the following influenza season, the WHO said. "The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, including those circulating and infecting humans," the WHO said.New H3N2 strain Mimicking last year's recommendation, the WHO recommends manufacturers produce trivalent (three-strain) vaccines for use in the 2025 Southern Hemisphere influenza season, given that one of the influenza B strains used in quadrivalent (four-strain) vaccines hasn't been detected in years. The 2009 H1N1 recommendations remain the same as last year's, as do the B/Victoria lineage recommendations, but the H3N2 component has changed.For egg-based vaccines, the experts recommend an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Croatia/10136RV/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. For cell-culture vaccines, they recommend an A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/District of Columbia/27/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.For quadrivalent vaccines, the recommendation is unchanged from last year, a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses.The recommendations today do not deviate from the WHO's February recommendations for Northern Hemisphere flu vaccines. Missouri investigates more possible human-to-human H5N1 avian flu spread News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Wavebreakmedia / iStock Today the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said investigators in Missouri were looking into eight possible human infections of H5N1 avian flu virus after the state reported its first case last month. If confirmed, the cases would mark the first instance of human-to-human H5N1 transmission in the country. At least one household member and six healthcare workers who encountered the index case-patient are being investigated after showing symptoms of viral infection. A week ago, the CDC noted that only two healthcare workers who had contact with the Missouri patient had symptoms.So far 14 human H5N1 cases have been reported in the United States this year, most all but one in agricultural workers who were in close contact with infected cattle. All patients have recovered, but the Missouri patient was hospitalized for his or her illness. Healthcare contact before droplet precautionsSome of the healthcare workers came into contact with the Missouri patient before droplet protocols were in place. Though symptoms have now resolved, the CDC said they would use antibody tests to determine if any of the healthcare workers had the virus. To date, only one case of influenza A(H5N1) has been detected in Missouri. No contacts of that case have tested positive for influenza A(H5N1)."Results of serology testing at CDC on the positive case and their previously identified household contact are still pending," the CDC said. "To date, only one case of influenza A(H5N1) has been detected in Missouri. No contacts of that case have tested positive for influenza A(H5N1)." COVID numbers decline slightly across US; RSV, flu activity low News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 Influenza, General Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) In several weekly updates published today, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said seasonal influenza and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) activity are low nationally, and COVID-19 activity is elevated but declining.The test-positivity percentage for COVID-19 dropped to 11.6% last week from 13.4 % the prior week, according to the weekly update for the week ending on September 21.Other COVID indicators declined as well, but only slightly. Emergency department visits dropped from 1.7% to 1.4%, and hospitalizations per 100,000 population dropped to 4.0, down from the prior week's 4.1. In its biweekly variant update, the CDC noted that the KP.3.1.1 Omicron subvariant accounts for 52.7% of infections, the same as 2 weeks ago.Wastewater levels for COVID-19 remain high but low for RSV and influenza. Of flu cases identified through specimens testing, the H1N1 strain accounts for 53.5% of cases, H3N2 for 46.5%, and influenza B for 1.2%. Influenza test positivity for the week ending on September 21 was 0.6%.Outpatient respiratory illness visits also remained steady, at 1.9%.Of note, the CDC recorded no new human infections with novel influenza A viruses, with the season's total remaining at 23. Very low vaccine uptakeAccording to the CDC, the early weeks of flu vaccine availability have resulted in 9.6% adults reporting receipt of a flu vaccine and 4.5% of adults reporting receipt of the updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccineAmong adults 75 years and older, 34.0% reported ever receiving an RSV vaccine. Quick takes: US measles outbreak slows, mpox vaccine for Africa, more polio News brief Jim Wappes Topics Measles Mpox Polio In its weekly update today, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed just 2 new measles cases, raising the national total to 264. The previous week saw 11 new cases. Among the case-patients, 88% were unvaccinated or their vaccine status was unknown, and 41% of the total were hospitalized. Seventy-three percent of patients were 19 years or younger, with 42% under age 5 years. The CDC has tracked 13 outbreaks that account for 70% of cases.Bavarian Nordic yesterday announced an agreement with UNICEF to supply 1 million doses of Jynneos mpox vaccine this year for African nations affected by mpox. UNICEF said the vaccine will be available at the lowest market price for 77 low- and lower-middle–income countries. The agreement includes the 500,000 doses that Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, committed to earlier this month. Bavarian Nordic President and CEO Paul Chaplin, PhD, said the agreement "represents a significant contribution to the global efforts to combat the mpox outbreak in Africa." In related news, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says it has received pledges of $814 million in support of mpox response efforts, a number that could top $1 billion, according to Reuters.The Global Polio Eradication Initiative yesterday in its weekly update noted 10 new polio cases in three countries: Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Nigeria. Pakistan confirmed four cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in Balochistan, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, for 21 total WPV1 cases this year. That compares with 6 for all of last year. The DRC had 2 circulating vaccine-derived type 2 (cVDPV2) cases in Maindombe province, raising its 2024 total to 12. And Nigeria recorded 4 cVDPV2 cases in Borno, Gombe, and Yobe states, raising its total for the year to 57 cases.

"However, the altered ecology of H5N1 has opened the door to new evolutionary pathways," he said.Shortcomings of control measures in cattle, wildlifeThe experts underscored several potential gaps in controlling the virus, including reluctance to pursue modern vaccine and surveillance technologies and sparse data regarding transmission of H5N1 between cows and humans on dairy farms in the United States.In the past, US cattle producers eradicated foot-and-mouth disease by rapidly sharing data. The authors note, however, that months of missing data on the extent of the spread on US dairy farms leaves researchers, veterinarians, and policymakers in the dark.Very few states are doing bulk-tank testing to proactively look for the virus. "H5N1 is a reportable disease in poultry, but not mammals, in the US," Peacock said. "The US Department of Agriculture requires H5N1 testing only in lactating cattle prior to interstate movement."What keeps scientists up at night is the possibility of unseen chains of transmission silently spreading.The group also pointed to a gap in wildlife testing, which currently involves just carcass testing. The authors said testing the animals while they are alive could help identify any undetected circulation that might be occurring."What keeps scientists up at night is the possibility of unseen chains of transmission silently spreading through farm worker barracks, swine barns, or developing countries, evolving under the radar because testing criteria are narrow, government authorities are feared, or resources are thin," they wrote.Severity in humans unclearIf the current H5N1 virus starts spreading readily in people, disease severity is unclear, given that recent infections have a greatly lower case-fatality rate—with the illness mainly consisting of eye symptoms—compared to the earlier H5N1 virus that circulated in Asia. Older people might have partial immunity the H5N1 due to childhood exposure to similar viruses, and people born since the 1968 H3N2 flu pandemic might be more susceptible, the authors said.

Genomic surveillance of respiratory viruses with epidemic and/or pandemic potential such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV is crucial for informing public health response measures. Sequencing of these viruses, especially from samples obtained through systematic and standardized sampling of cases meeting influenza-like illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) case definitions, enables continuous monitoring of trends of existing and emerging genetic variants and improved geographic, demographic and temporal representativeness of data. WHO supports countries in strengthening systematic genomic surveillance and encourages GISRS laboratories to sequence both influenza and SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens from its sentinel surveillance in a timely manner and share genetic sequence data (GSD) with associated metadata through publicly accessible databases such as the GISAID EpiFlu™ and EpiCoV™. Some countries may also consider prioritizing RSV surveillance and implementing sequencing for this virus as well. GSD and associated metadata from RSV can also be shared publicly e.g., via GISAID EpiRSV™. Objectives The overall aim is to strengthen GISRS genomic surveillance capacity, with specific objectives to: 1. Scale up GISRS Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV genomic surveillance, data sharing and interpretation of sequences using bioinformatics; and 2. Equip National Influenza Centres (NICs) with the skills to access, use and contribute to GISAID databases, platforms and tools. Agenda 1. Introduction to GISRS genomic surveillance 2. Navigating GISAID databases 3. Data sharing, curation and retrieval on EpiFlu™4. Influenza data analysis using GISAID tools: Customized summaries and reports using EpiCharts Quality checking, clade assignment and mutational analysis with FluSurver Monitoring diagnostic primers using PrimerChecker Customized comparative genomics and phylogenetic tree generation with AudacityInstant 5. Statistical Visualization and Dashboards including: Emerging Variants Monitoring geographical distribution of clades Phylodynamics ParticipantsSpecialists from WHO-recognized and National Influenza Laboratories responsible for genetic analyses of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV viruses. Participants are expected to bring their computers and have the ability to use an internet browser and a simple text editor, such as Notepad. The working language of the workshop will be English. If you are attending the 12th edition of Options for the Control of Influenza Congress in Brisbane, Australia, you are invited to register for this workshop by sending your name and title to gisrs-whohq@who.int.

US Navy, Ryan M. Breeden / Flickr cc The CDC said the second health worker wasn’t tested, because his or her illness had resolved before the investigation began. The initial case involved a patient with underlying health conditions and was hospitalized for chest pain, gastrointestinal issues, and other symptoms. A respiratory panel done during hospitalization was positive for influenza A and was later subtyped as H5. Follow-up analysis determined that the virus was H5N1 and similar to the strain infecting dairy cattle, though the patient had no known exposure to cows or other sick patients.Last week, the CDC said Missouri officials had identified two symptomatic contacts, the patient’s household contact and the first health worker.In its update, the CDC added that blood samples from the Missouri patient and the household contact have been collected by Missouri health officials and will be sent to the CDC for serologic testing. The first health worker tested negative for influenza in an earlier test, and serological testing will be offered to the second health worker.CDC and Ohio partners launch serosurvey in veterinary workersIn a related development, the CDC said it and staff from the Ohio Department of Health last week launched a serosurvey of bovine veterinary workers who attended the American Association of Bovine Practitioners (AABP) annual conference in Columbus, Ohio. The groups enrolled 150 attendees across 45 states who have worked with cattle in the last 3 months. Participants completed a survey that included questions on exposure, personal protective equipment use, and whether they had experienced flulike symptoms since January. Poll: Only 45% of older adults will get updated COVID vaccines News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 Only 45% of Americans age 50 and older say they're likely to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine this season, according to a poll today from the University of Michigan. The poll shows many at high risk of severe illness appear unlikely to seek the vaccine, and interest in an updated vaccine varies widely by age-group, education level, and other factors.The results come from the National Poll on Healthy Aging conducted in August. At the time of polling, new COVID vaccines were not yet widely available, but they had been approved for use and endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among adults 75 and older, 59% said they were likely to get the updated COVID-19 shot, with 49% of them saying they’re very likely and 10% saying they're somewhat likely. Among adults 65 to 74, 51% said they were likely to get the vaccine.Level of education plays a roleAmong those aged 50 to 64, more said they were unlikely to get the new vaccine; 55% unlikely, compared with 37% likely.In 2023, nearly half of all US COVID hospitalizations were among those ages 75 and older. The poll showed demographic differences as well. Adults with a Bachelor's degree were more likely to get vaccinated—54%, compared with 41% of those with lower levels of education. Overall, women were slightly more likely than men to say they would be vaccinated. Our new poll data suggest that providers and healthcare organizations need to do more to encourage older adults to get vaccinated soon."Our new poll data suggest that providers and healthcare organizations need to do more to encourage older adults to get vaccinated soon, especially given the current wave of cases and the likelihood of another wave this winter," said senior advisor to the poll Preeti Malani, MD, in a press release from the University of Michigan. Ghana confirms human H9N2 avian flu infection News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) The World Health Organization (WHO) said last week that Ghana has notified it of a human H9N2 avian flu case, marking the first zoonotic avian flu case reported from the country. chrispecoraro / iStock The patient is a 5-year-old girl who lives near the border with Burkina Faso and who became ill on May 5. Two days later, she was seen at a local hospital and treated for flulike illness. PCR testing on her respiratory sample was positive for H3N2 seasonal flu.However, genomic testing identified the virus as H9 avian influenza, and additional testing at WHO collaborating centers in the United Kingdom and the United States confirmed the presence of H9N2 on August 6. After the subtype was confirmed, regional health officials visited the patient, who was experiencing a new onset of respiratory symptoms. Serum and respiratory samples were negative for flu and the girl has recovered.No known exposure to poultryInvestigators found that the patient had no known exposure to poultry or people sick with similar symptoms. Samples from close contacts were negative, and no related cases have been detected in the community.Poultry illnesses have been reported from the region where the girl lives, but the cause hasn’t been confirmed. Ghana has reported low pathogenic H9N2 in poultry since 2017, the WHO said.H9N2 is known to circulate in poultry, especially in Asia where sporadic infections are reported, mainly in children and mostly mild after exposure to poultry. The WHO said no sustained human-to-human H9N2 activity has been reported. California reports 18 more H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cows News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today confirmed 18 more H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in dairy cattle, nearly doubling the state’s outbreak total. Brian Henderson/Flickr cc California, the country’s biggest dairy producing state, now has the second highest number of outbreaks (34), with Colorado still the state reporting the most outbreaks. The outbreaks have been centered in the Central Valley, and state agriculture officials have been identifying other affected farms due to enhanced surveillance that has focused on those with connections to earlier-affected facilities.The latest outbreaks push the country’s total number of dairy cow outbreaks to 232 from 14 states since March. Virus turns up at Florida poultry marketIn poultry outbreaks developments, USDA APHIS confirmed one more outbreak, which involves a live bird market in Florida’s Orange County that has 2,500 birds. Over the past few months, similar outbreaks at live bird markets were reported from two other Florida counties—Hillsborough and Miami-Dade.

Follow-up analysis determined that the virus was H5N1 and similar to the strain infecting dairy cattle, though the patient had no known exposure to cows or other sick patients.Last week, the CDC said Missouri officials had identified two symptomatic contacts, the patient’s household contact and the first health worker.In its update, the CDC added that blood samples from the Missouri patient and the household contact have been collected by Missouri health officials and will be sent to the CDC for serologic testing. The first health worker tested negative for influenza in an earlier test, and serological testing will be offered to the second health worker.CDC and Ohio partners launch serosurvey in veterinary workersIn a related development, the CDC said it and staff from the Ohio Department of Health last week launched a serosurvey of bovine veterinary workers who attended the American Association of Bovine Practitioners (AABP) annual conference in Columbus, Ohio. The groups enrolled 150 attendees across 45 states who have worked with cattle in the last 3 months. Participants completed a survey that included questions on exposure, personal protective equipment use, and whether they had experienced flulike symptoms since January. California reports 18 more H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cows News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today confirmed 18 more H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in dairy cattle, nearly doubling the state’s outbreak total. Brian Henderson/Flickr cc California, the country’s biggest dairy producing state, now has the second highest number of outbreaks (34), with Colorado still the state reporting the most outbreaks. The outbreaks have been centered in the Central Valley, and state agriculture officials have been identifying other affected farms due to enhanced surveillance that has focused on those with connections to earlier-affected facilities.The latest outbreaks push the country’s total number of dairy cow outbreaks to 232 from 14 states since March. Virus turns up at Florida poultry marketIn poultry outbreaks developments, USDA APHIS confirmed one more outbreak, which involves a live bird market in Florida’s Orange County that has 2,500 birds. Over the past few months, similar outbreaks at live bird markets were reported from two other Florida counties—Hillsborough and Miami-Dade.

Overview There are steps older adults can take to reduce their risk for severe respiratory illnesses. As people get older, their immune systems do not work as well. Older adults are also more likely to have underlying health conditions. Most deaths from respiratory viruses occur in people older than 65, with risk increasing sharply with advancing age. Why prevention is important Studies have shown that: Compared to people ages 18-39 years, people over age 75 are about 9 times as likely to die from COVID-19. Learn more. Each year, it is estimated that 100,000-160,000 older adults in the United States are hospitalized due to RSV infection. Learn more. In recent years, it's estimated that between 70 percent and 85 percent of seasonal flu-related deaths in the United States have occurred among people 65 years and older, and between about 50 percent and 70 percent of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations have occurred among people in this age group. Learn more. Over 95% of adults hospitalized in 2023-2024 due to COVID-19 had no record of receiving the latest vaccine. Making a Plan Reducing risk‎ If you are, or if you spend time with, an older adult, using the prevention strategies described in CDC's Respiratory Virus Guidance is especially important. In addition, there are several specific considerations for older adults listed below. Immunizations In addition to getting the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, there are some unique respiratory virus immunization recommendations for older adults: All adults should have a current flu vaccine, but adults aged 65 years or older are recommended to receive a high dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine (for example, Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent inactivated flu vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent recombinant flu vaccine, or Fluad Quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated flu vaccine). All adults age 75 and older and adults age 60-74 years who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease should receive a single dose of RSV vaccine. The Eldercare Locator, a national resource funded by the Administration for Community Living, can help older adults find local vaccination clinics, connect with accessible transportation, and provide other assistance in accessing vaccinations. Masks Note that better fitting masks (for example, N95 or KN95 respirators) are more effective at protecting you from inhaling germs than other types of masks are (for example, cloth masks or surgical/disposable masks). Treatment COVID-19 antivirals are recommended for all older adults (over age 50) and certain people at higher risk for complications from COVID-19. Flu antivirals are recommended for certain people at high risk for complications from flu, including adults ages 65 years and older. To learn more about if treatment is right for you, speak with a healthcare provider. Tests The Administration for Community Living and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response are partnering to distribute tests to the aging and disability networks. You may be able to get COVID-19 tests for free through your Area Agency on Aging. Notice‎ CDC offers separate, specific guidance for healthcare settings (COVID-19, flu, and general infection prevention and control). Federal civil rights laws may require reasonable modifications or reasonable accommodations in various circumstances. Nothing in this guidance is intended to detract from or supersede those laws.

A prescription is still required.· Vaccine recipients will be sent the vaccine, the prescribing information, information for patients and their caregivers ,and instructions for use. Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved FluMist for self- or caregiver-administration. FluMist is approved for the prevention of influenza disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A and B in individuals 2 through 49 years of age. FluMist is sprayed into the nose and has been used safely and effectively for many years. It was initially approved by the FDA in 2003 for use in individuals 5 through 49 years of age, and in 2007, the FDA approved the use of FluMist to include children 2 through 5 years of age. It is the first vaccine to prevent influenza, more commonly known as the flu, that does not need to be administered by a health care provider. “Today’s approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death. This approval adds another option for vaccination against influenza disease and demonstrates the FDA’s commitment to advancing public health.” The flu is a common and contagious respiratory disease that is caused by influenza viruses that typically circulate during the fall and winter in the U.S. It can cause mild to severe illness with a range of symptoms that usually appear suddenly, such as body aches, fever, coughing, sore throat, tiredness and a stuffy or runny nose. Flu can be life-threatening and cause serious complications that can lead to hospitalization or death, particularly in high-risk groups such as the elderly, young children and people with certain chronic medical conditions. Each flu season is different and the health impacts can be substantial and vary widely from season to season, with some flu seasons being worse than others. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, flu has resulted in about 9.3 million to 41 million illnesses, 100,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations and 4,900 to 51,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2023. Numerous FDA-approved vaccines are available each flu season to prevent influenza. FluMist contains a weakened form of live influenza virus strains and is sprayed in the nose. A prescription is still required to receive FluMist. There are now two approved options for receiving FluMist. The vaccine may be administered by a health care provider in a health care setting (including a pharmacy) or it may be administered by the vaccine recipient or a caregiver who is 18 years of age or older. For those interested in self- or caregiver-administration, the vaccine manufacturer plans to make the vaccine available through a third-party online pharmacy. Those who choose this option will complete a screening and eligibility assessment when they order FluMist. The third-party pharmacy determines eligibility based on the completed screening and, if it is determined that the intended vaccine recipient is eligible, the pharmacy writes the prescription and ships the vaccine to the address provided by the individual who placed the order. The vaccine can then be administered to the prescribed household member(s) at their convenience. A caregiver should administer FluMist to individuals 2 through 17 years of age, as individuals in this age group should not self-administer the vaccine.A study was conducted with vaccine recipients and caregivers to evaluate whether the instructions for use were appropriately designed so that recipients and caregivers could safely and effectively use the vaccine. Vaccine recipients and caregivers who administer FluMist will be sent the vaccine, the Prescribing Information, Information for Patients and their Caregivers and Instructions for Use. The Instructions for Use provides detailed instructions for storage, administration and disposal of FluMist.

Maternal fever in pregnancy has been linked to poor outcomes in children, including increased risk of neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism and depression. The study sought to define the relationship between maternal flu and febrile seizures, which typically occur from 6 months to 5 years of age.The findings come from 1,316,107 mother-baby pairs identified from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2013, using records in Taiwan's Maternal and Child Health Database. Children were followed up until December 31, 2020.Among the 75,835 children whose mothers had flu during pregnancy, 2,456 (3.2%) developed seizures during their follow-up period, the authors said. Boys more likely to have seizuresThe cumulative risk of childhood seizures was significantly higher among children who had been exposed to maternal influenza virus infections. The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.14) for seizures, 1.11 (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.17) for febrile convulsions, and 1.04 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.13) for epilepsy. Further analysis showed the risk of epilepsy was not statistically significant. For all children in the study, advanced maternal age, gestational high blood pressure, cesarean delivery, and being a boy were associated with increased risk of seizures. "Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying childhood neurological development," the authors concluded. Biden administration announces 1 million vaccine doses for Africa's mpox response News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Mpox At the United Nations General Assembly meeting today, US President Joe Biden announced new support for Africa's mpox response, including 1 million vaccine doses and at least $500 million in further support. Norway UN/Flickr cc In the UN address, Biden called on other countries and groups to step up their help for Africa. "We call on governments, charities, and businesses to match our pledge—and make this a $1 billion commitment to the people of Africa."In a fact sheet, the White House said 10,000 vaccine doses arrived in Nigeria in August and 50,000 doses arrived this month in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The next 300,000 doses will be available immediately for distribution through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organization (WHO) Access and Allocation Mechanism. US officials will deliver the rest of the doses in tranches, based on country progress in administering the doses and with coordination with Gavi.Support aligns with regional response planMeanwhile, the financial support will be delivered bilaterally through existing partnerships with African countries as well as through multilateral groups. The White House added that the investments will align with the preparedness and response plan recently announced the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and the WHO. The federal government has already deployed staff to the DRC and neighboring countries, including epidemiologists, laboratorians, and risk communication experts.The US Department of Health and Human Services today said the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response is donating the 1 million doses to the international response, and it added that it is lending Bavarian Nordic, the maker of the Jynneos vaccine, 200,000 doses to ensure commercial supply to the US market without diminishing the company's ability to fulfill international orders and donations.African health officials have estimated the region needs at least 10 million vaccine doses for the outbreak response. A number of groups have also announced donations, including the European Commission, Japan's government, and Bavarian Nordic itself. Survey finds most patients expect antibiotics for illnesses that don't need them News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Aybars Karakas / iStock A survey of primary care patients in Texas found that most expected to receive antibiotics for illnesses commonly caused by viruses, researchers reported yesterday in the Annals of Family Medicine.The survey, developed by researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and administered from January 2020 to June 2021 at six public primary care clinics and two private emergency departments in Harris County, Texas, sought to assess patient expectations for antibiotics for acute diarrhea, sore throat, cold/flu, sinus infections, and bronchitis symptoms. For each symptom illness, respondents were asked to respond to the statements "Taking antibiotics will help you get better quickly" and "You should take antibiotics to avoid getting sicker" using a 5-point Likert scale, and were asked if they knew about risks associated with antibiotic use. The researchers also compared the difference in patient expectations by sociodemographic groups and between public and private healthcare systems.Lack of knowledge about potential risksOf the 564 patients surveyed, 93% expected to receive an antibiotic for one of the five pre-defined illnesses/symptoms, with 84% believing that antibiotics would improve bronchitis, followed by sinus infections (72%), sore throat (66%), cold/flu (64%), and diarrhea (36%). Overall, 37% of patients lacked knowledge of antibiotic risks.Compared with private, public clinic patients were nearly twice as likely to expect antibiotics for diarrhea (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 2.8), sore throat (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.2), cold/flu (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.3), and overall (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.3). Lack of knowledge of potential risks of antibiotic use was associated with increased antibiotic expectations for diarrhea (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.4) and cold/flu symptoms (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.0 to 4.4). Lower education and inadequate health literacy were predictors of antibiotic expectations for diarrhea. "Future stewardship interventions to reduce inappropriate patient antibiotic expectations should (1) inform patients of the symptoms/illnesses that antibiotics treat and (2) emphasize the individual harmsisks (or harmsisks to others close to an individual) of antibiotics," the researchers wrote, adding that they are developing a patient-clinician antibiotic education tool based on the findings. BARDA funds 2 antifungal drug candidates News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Fungal Infection The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) announced last week that it has awarded $29 million to Swiss drugmaker Basilea Pharmaceutica to develop two first-in-class antifungal drugs to treat drug-resistant invasive fungal infections. The funding will help Basilea develop Fosmanogepix, a broad-spectrum antifungal that targets drug-resistant invasive candidiasis—including infections caused by Candida auris—and invasive mold infections, and BAL2062, which has activity against drug-resistant Aspergillus strains. Part of preparedness effortsBARDA is part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the US Department of Health and Human Services and is one the leading public sector funders of antibiotics and diagnostics for both biothreat pathogens and opportunistic secondary infections. The award is a component of BARDA's medical countermeasures portfolio."Fosmanogepix and BAL2062 are the first antifungals to enter the BARDA portfolio and will address the urgent need for novel drugs to treat fungal infections that might arise following a mass casualty incident, such as a radiological or nuclear incident," the agency said in a Basilea press release.As part of the contract, BARDA will also develop pediatric formulations of the drugs, along with antifungal susceptibility testing diagnostics. Survey reveals concerning antibiotic dispensing practices in Mideast pharmacies News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship AmandaLewis / iStock A survey of pharmacists from 19 Arab nations revealed a wide and concerning variation in knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding the use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), researchers reported last week in Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control.Of the 3,100 pharmacists who received the survey, 2,833 (91.3%) completed it. Respondents were mostly male (57.4%), aged from 19 to 31 years (76.2%), and from community pharmacies (71.2%). Nearly half (45.7%) did not know antibiotics can be used for prevention, 33.3% didn't know that the wrong choice of antibiotics may promote resistance, and 34.2% didn't consider AMR to be a global problem. In addition, 41.2% had the wrong answer when asked whether antibiotics can help treat the common cold, cough, flu, or fever.Regarding practice patterns, more than half (53.8%) said they do not consistently adhere to guidelines when dispensing antibiotics, 36.8% said they do not agree with policies of not dispensing antibiotics without a prescription, and 67.5% said that refusing to dispense antibiotics without a prescription would negatively affect sales and profits. Three quarters of respondents believed that community pharmacists had qualifications to prescribe antibiotics for suspected infections.More education neededThe study authors say the findings highlight the need for governments in the region to develop and implement policies to change antibiotic dispensing practices and promote sensible antibiotic use among community pharmacists, who are primary sources of antibiotics intended for self-medication in the countries surveyed. "Ultimately our discoveries underscore why enhancing education about responsible antibiotic use via awareness campaigns is vital to battling bacterial resistance levels that continue to rise within our communities," they wrote.

BY RICHARD SKOLNIKWhite Rock We are now entering “flu and RSV season.” We are also facing a possible “winter wave ofCOVID.”In this light, you will find below an excellent summary of key information on vaccines against COVID, RSV, and influenza. This table was prepared (and put into the public domain), by Katelyn Jetelina, the creator of Your Local Epidemiologist, a well-regarded public health newsletter. It is especially important to note that the willingness to vaccinate against influenza is declining in the US. This reduces immunity at the community level and creates a higher risk of flu outbreaks that can sicken people and strain the health system. In this context, vaccinating yourselves and your loved ones to try to reduce the risk of infection and severe illness becomes even more important.It is also especially important to speak with your health care providers about your eligibility for vaccines, the best time to get them, and the type of vaccine you should get, such as a high dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine for those over 65 years of age.Members of the community, in fact, may wish to get their influenza vaccines at a communityclinic that Los Alamos Medical Center will host in its back parking lot on Saturday, Oct. 5 from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.More detailed information about influenza, RSV, and COVID and the vaccines to address themcan be found on CDC’s web pages.

Breadcrumb Home Advancing Health Conditions and Services COVID-19 Infectious Diseases Primary Care Fall 2024 update for flu, COVID-19 and Mpox Conditions and Services COVID-19 Infectious Diseases Primary Care Fall 2024 update for flu, COVID-19 and Mpox September 24, 2024 As we head into autumn, it's time to take stock of the current landscape of infectious diseases that have dominated headlines in recent years. Infectious diseases and critical care physician Kelly Cawcutt, MD, MS, provides the latest information on influenza, COVID-19 and Mpox.Flu: Prepare nowThe Southern Hemisphere's experience often serves as a preview for what the Northern Hemisphere might face, according to Dr. Cawcutt.“This year, the flu season in the Southern Hemisphere caused high levels of illness, primarily driven by influenza A, which tends to cause more severe illness,” she says. "I think there is a fair amount of concern that we're going to see the flu season be significant this year.”Flu vaccinesGiven the potential for a significant flu season, individuals may want to consider getting a flu shot sooner rather than later. "We generally recommend influenza vaccines to be given in September or October because that usually predates the beginning of flu season," Dr. Cawcutt says. “We’re not in full flu season yet, so there is time, but remember, it does take about two weeks to get full effect from any influenza vaccination. Even if you wait, though, and flu season has started, it does not mean it's too late to get the flu vaccine.”Flu vaccines are updated each year to match the most circulating influenza virus strains. This year's flu vaccine is a trivalent vaccine, meaning it contains three strains of influenza."Historically, we have had quadrivalent vaccines, which mean there's four different strains,” Dr. Cawcutt explains. “This year, it's three different strains, not because one of those wasn't effective, but because that fourth strain hasn't been circulating since 2020.”While the exact effectiveness of the vaccine against the latest strains won't be known until flu season begins, Dr. Cawcutt says that, even in years with lower match percentages, the vaccine still provides clear benefits in reducing the severity of illness.Avian flu: A cause for concern?While not currently a major threat to humans, avian influenza is being closely monitored. “So far, thankfully, most cases of avian influenza we’ve seen have been mild and have not required hospitalization,” Dr. Cawcutt says. “It does not appear to be spreading quickly in a human-to-human form, but there's a lot of close attention on that."For those in agricultural areas or with potential exposure to birds, it's important to be aware of the risk. If you develop flu-like symptoms after exposure to birds, cattle or another infected person, inform your health care provider, as special testing may be required to identify avian influenza.COVID-19: Continuing vigilanceThe country has recently seen a summer surge of COVID-19, with increased cases, hospitalizations and deaths. “Locally, we have not seen as many hospitalizations for COVID-19-related disease, which is fantastic and speaks to immunity and some factors related to the current variants," Dr. Cawcutt says. “However, this does not mean there is not continued value in vaccination to decrease severity of illness should you contract COVID-19.”Despite lower hospitalization rates, COVID-19 remains prevalent in many Nebraska communities. Wastewater data for the state indicates high levels of virus circulation in some areas.Updated vaccines and recommendationsThe good news is that updated COVID-19 vaccines are now available from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. These new vaccines have been designed to target the most recent circulating strains, providing better protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death.For those who have recently had COVID-19, Dr. Cawcutt advises that it's generally fine to get vaccinated once you've fully recovered from your illness, typically after a week or two. However, if you've received a COVID-19 vaccination recently, it's recommended to wait four months between vaccines.The updated vaccines are recommended for individuals 6 months and older for Pfizer and Moderna and 12 years and older for Novavax.Mpox: Staying awareMpox is a virus normally linked to travel in West and Central Africa. Mpox is classified into two main groups: clade 1 and clade 2. The World Health Organization recently declared a public health emergency due to a surge in Mpox cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DRC."The current outbreak happening in DRC is the clade 1 side of Mpox, which is more severe and can cause more systemic illness and carries a higher risk of death," Dr. Cawcutt says.It's important to note that this outbreak involves a different, more severe strain of Mpox than what was seen in the U.S. in recent years. While no cases of this strain have been identified in the U.S. yet, other countries have reported sporadic cases related to travel.The risk remains low for the general public in the U.S. and while there are Mpox vaccines, they are not currently recommended. However, Dr. Cawcutt advises, "I think it's really about keeping a level of awareness. My biggest concern is people who might be traveling to or from Africa.”Dr. Cawcutt advises those traveling to Africa to be evaluated at a travel clinic. There, they can receive counseling and be considered potential travel-related vaccinations and prophylaxis, based on their travel activities and plans.Returning travelers should seek care if they become ill with a fever over 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit. They should also reach out to their providers with any known exposures to illnesses.Staying informed and making decisionsWhen navigating the complex landscape of infectious diseases, staying informed through reputable sources is crucial. "I would recommend people stick to known entities,” Dr. Cawcutt says. “So, locally, talk to your physician; that's a great place to start. But in addition, look to information coming out from institutions like Nebraska Medicine and UNMC."She also emphasizes the importance of vaccination: "As a health care community and infectious diseases physician, I recognize that there's been a change in the level of concern about vaccines and their safety and effectiveness, and whether people should get them or not. But they are safe and effective. They do help prevent disease and more severe levels of illness."Dr. Cawcutt adds that she and her family receive vaccinations, along with many members of the health care community. “There is a clear benefit,” she says. “Millions and millions of doses have been given and demonstrate a high level of safety, based on the number of people who have received these vaccines.”Staying informed, following public health guidelines and considering vaccination options for flu and COVID-19 remain key strategies in protecting individual and community health.

GlobalData Healthcare September 27, 2024 Share Copy Link Share on X Share on Linkedin Share on Facebook FluMist is a live-attenuated influenza vaccine. Credit: PeopleImages.com – Yuri A via Shutterstock. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first self-administered seasonal influenza vaccine – AstraZeneca’s FluMist. FluMist has been available in the US since 2003, but beginning next year, the nasal spray vaccine will also be available for self-administration. This approval increases the accessibility of seasonal influenza vaccines and has the potential to increase vaccine uptake. FluMist is approved for use in the US in children and adults aged two through 49 years. It is the only seasonal influenza vaccine to be delivered intranasally, which makes it a great option for those who may be needle-phobic.

Find out more Related Company ProfilesAstraZeneca PlcView all According to leading data and analytics company GlobalData, the influenza virus was responsible for at least 2.1 million illnesses, 21,000 hospitalisations, and 4,700 deaths during the 2023-24 US influenza season. Vaccination against the influenza virus remains the most important intervention in the prevention of influenza-associated complications, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone six months and older receives a vaccination each influenza season. FluMist is a live-attenuated influenza vaccine: It is manufactured using a live, weakened version of the influenza virus. This differentiates FluMist from traditional injectable vaccines, which are manufactured using either killed viruses, proteins, or cell-culturing methods. All are effective methods of protection against the seasonal influenza virus. As part of AstraZeneca’s submission to the FDA, human factors/usability studies were conducted. These studies evaluated whether adults 18 through 49 years of age could properly administer FluMist when given instructions for use. The results of these studies showed that 100% of users were able to administer a full dose. Further, the results of the studies showed that efficacy, immunogenicity, and adverse events associated with self-administration of FluMist were similar to those associated with healthcare provider-based administration. Children two through 17 years of age can receive the vaccination from a parent/caregiver. FluMist’s approval for self- or caregiver-administration provides patients with increased accessibility to the seasonal influenza vaccine. It also provides patients with increased flexibility to receive the vaccine at their convenience, and in turn, has the potential to increase uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine.

To access FluMist for self-administration, AstraZeneca plans to utilise a third-party online pharmacy. Following a screening and eligibility assessment, the online pharmacy will prescribe and ship the vaccine to the patient’s home. AstraZeneca expects this option to be available for the 2025-26 influenza season. According to GlobalData, the US vaccination rate for seasonal influenza during the 2023-24 season was estimated to be 47%, and this rate is only expected to increase marginally over the coming years. Further, according to GlobalData’s survey of high-prescribing physicians in the US, the percentages of patients vaccinated against seasonal influenza who were administered FluMist during the 2022-23 season were 2.2% of children two to four years of age, 13.4% of children five to 17 years of age, and 3.4% of adults 18-49 years of age. This survey was conducted in June 2023 and included 23 high-prescribing physicians based in the US. By increasing access to FluMist, there is potential for these percentages to increase. It is possible that we will see an increase in FluMist’s US flu vaccine patient share, given the convenient route of administration and ease of access, as well as an overall increase in seasonal influenza vaccine uptake.

When evaluating this risk based on seizure type, an elevated risk did not remain for epilepsy, but the risk of febrile convulsions was significantly increased.Click here for the full article.Young adult prediabetes linked to future gestational diabetesPrediabetes in young people may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes later in life, according to a recent study from Mount Sinai.The odds of having gestational diabetes at first birth were increased more than 2-fold among patients with preconception prediabetes, with an adjusted relative risk (aRR) of 2.21 compared to those with normoglycemia. Hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and preterm birth risks were also increased, both having an aRR of 1.18.Click here for the full article.Family history criteria used to predict breast cancer genetic risk variantsPatients with a familial risk of breast cancer can be identified using the electronic health record (EHR)-derived Seven-Question Family History Questionnaire (FHS7), according to a recent study published in JAMA Network Open.A 3-fold increased risk of being BRCA1/2 positive was reported in both male and female patients with FHS7-positive status. When prescreening with FHS7, the number needed to test to detect a BRCA1/2-positive patient decreased from 128 to 53 among women and from 119 to 42 among men.Click here for the full article.Increasing birthweight over time reportedAn increase in term birthweights over time has been observed since 1950, according to a recent study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology.Data indicated a significant increase in the mean term birthweight of 4.74 g per year reported from municipality, community, or regional sources. When addressing geographical variations, this annual increase was 3.85 g.Click here for the full article.Similar live birth rates found for blastocyst vs cleavage stage embryo transfers in IVF treatmentCumulative live birth rates are similar between blastocyst stage embryo transfers and cleavage stage embryo transfers in women with 4 or more embryos available during in vitro fertilization treatment, according to a recent study published in BMJ.The intention-to-treat cumulative live birth rate was 58.9% in the blastocyst stage group and 58.4% in the cleavage stage group. With a difference of 0.4% and a risk ratio of 1.01, this data indicated no difference in live birth rates between groups.Click here for the full article.Recent VideosRelated Content Contemporary OB/GYN week in review: Heart health, medication abortion, and moreCeleste Krewson, Assistant EditorNovember 8th 2024ArticleReview some of the top stories from the Contemporary OB/GYN website over the last week, and catch up on anything you may have missed.Read MoreS4E1: New RNA platform can predict pregnancy complicationsFebruary 11th 2022PodcastIn this episode of Pap Talk, Contemporary OB/GYN® sat down with Maneesh Jain, CEO of Mirvie, and Michal Elovitz, MD, chief medical advisor at Mirvie, a new RNA platform that is able to predict pregnancy complications by revealing the biology of each pregnancy.

(KY3)—A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that the U.S. tied the record for the number of pediatric flu deaths during the 2023-2024 season, tying the 2019-2020 season.According to the report, 199 children died during the last respiratory virus season. Of the 158 children who were eligible for the flu vaccine and whose vaccination status was known, 131 were not fully vaccinated. Children six months and older are considered eligible.“You’re not immune to something if you’ve never encountered it if your body doesn’t recognize it as a germ,” said Dr. Emmanuel Obafemi-Ajayi, a pediatrician with Mercy Springfield. “So children are more vulnerable because their body’s immune systems have not been exposed.”According to Obafemi-Ajayi, flu cases start creeping up during the second or third month of school, which means flu season is right around the corner.“Kids are indoors, and they start to share a lot of these germs. Unfortunately, they take them home,” said Obafemi-Ajayi. “I’m not blaming the kids, but this kind of how they interact. They say children don’t share their toys, but they will share their germs.”Some Missouri schools partner with mobile flu vaccine clinics to make vaccines available to students with parental permission. Republic School District and Springfield Public Schools, for example, partner with Jordan Valley Community Health Center to offer free flu vaccines for students.“We want to promote wellness and students being healthy at all times,” said Natalie Botkin, director of health services at Republic School District. “And so I think one of the most important things that we can do heading into flu season is getting our vaccines.”Botkin said during the 2023-2024 flu season, the district saw its first flu case toward the end of October 2023. As the season neared January, it started reporting more cases, with the peak in February.“Come October, we will start kind of tracking those symptoms because we really look into how influenza is spreading across the county,” said Botkin. “Oftentimes, our schools will mimic or mirror what’s going on in the larger community, as well as the county.”According to Botkin, students can get the flu shot at the mobile clinic as long as their parents give permission via a consent form. Those forms are expected to start going out on Oct. 1.The district also provides a wellness checklist for parents. According to Botkin, there will be times when a student doesn’t feel well, and parents can check with their kids and ask them how they’re feeling.“I think it’s important for our parents to do a daily wellness check with their kids and ask them how they’re feeling,” said Botkin. “Oftentimes, kids will come to school, and they’ve been feeling lousy for a while. And so our parents, just touching base with kids, you know, how are you feeling?”To report a correction or typo, please email digitalnews@ky3.com.

(Getty Images) This story was originally published Nov. 10, 2022, and has since been updated to include new information about the 2024-25 respiratory illness season. Stay up to date on all health news by visiting VCU Health News. (Updated Sept. 23, 2024) By Sara McCloskey Respiratory illnesses tend to spread more often during the colder months. Similar to last year, health care professionals are keeping their eyes on three highly contagious illnesses affecting our community: COVID-19, influenza (flu), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). “It is difficult to discern one viral infection from just another five symptoms, therefore an assessment by a medical professional and nasal swab testing is important,” said Gonzalo Bearman, M.D., an infectious disease expert at VCU Health. "Viral respiratory infections continue to cause significant illness, this risk can be decreased by the current vaccines.” Earlier this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new guidelines on when to stay home and isolate yourself from others if you are sick with a respiratory illness. Sometimes, people are not sure what specific illness they have until they get tested. Since COVID-19, flu, and RSV also spread similarly, the strategies to prevent someone from spreading them are now more similar, too. “These new recommendations were created to be a more simplified, practical way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other highly contagious respiratory viruses,” Bearman said. “Vaccines and medications are available for COVID-19, flu and RSV. Vaccines, in particularly, significantly decrease the severity of illness, and decrease hospitalizations." As we head into respiratory illness season, Bearman shared with VCU Health News the differences among these viruses and tips for keeping yourself healthy. What are the symptoms of COVID-19, flu, and RSV – and how can I tell if I have one virus vs. another? This is a tricky question, since there is much overlap between the three illnesses, and they can all start with very similar symptoms. All can cause fevers, cough, shortness of breath, decreased energy, sore throat, headaches or runny nose. Flu and COVID-19 are more likely to cause body aches or muscle pain. Less commonly, stomach issues such as nausea or diarrhea can occur. COVID-19 is more likely to cause a loss of taste or smell, although this can be seen in other illnesses as well. Overall, the best way to tell the difference is to get tested. You can go to the doctor’s office to get tested for all three of these illnesses or buy COVID-19 tests at your local pharmacy. Who is most at risk of getting severely sick from these viruses? Children, older people, and immunocompromised patients are at the highest risk of getting severely sick with all of these diseases. Particularly for COVID-19 and flu, infants, those over 60 years old or people with chronic conditions are at higher risk (such as cancer, heart disease or diabetes, to name a few). Despite this, COVID-19, and flu can cause young healthy patients to get seriously sick, too. RSV can cause severe illness particularly for babies under 6 months and older adults. Most young healthy adults do not get severely sick. How can people best protect themselves? As we have experienced during the pandemic, changes can happen quickly. Be on the lookout for any changes in recommendations from medical professionals locally or federally. Getting vaccinated is still the best proven way to prevent yourself from getting severely sick. Flu and COVID-19 vaccines have been available for several years and they are updated annually to better protect you from the specific variants currently circulating the community. This is also the second year that several different RSV vaccines and medications are available for specific populations. RSV vaccines are being recommended for adults 60 and over as well as pregnant people, who can pass immunity to the virus to their newborns. Another medication was developed specifically for babies and toddlers that provides temporary immunity for several months. If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to reach out. Talk to your primary care provider about your eligibility for these voluntary vaccinations and medications. Here are some other quick tips: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 to 30 seconds. Avoid touching your eyes and mouth as much as possible. If you are sick, stay home. Try to avoid contact with others as much as possible. Use tissue paper or your upper sleeve to cover your cough and sneeze. Consider wearing masks, particularly if you are in a crowded public place (like a public bus or train) or if you’re around others who may be sick or at high risk of getting really sick. When should I consider going to my family or primary care doctor? If you have mild symptoms, it is best to stay home. You should still get tested and should contact your doctor, especially if you are at high risk of getting severely sick. At what point should I go to urgent care or an emergency department? You should seek urgent medical care if you are: Having difficulty breathing or persistent chest pain. Experiencing increased confusion or decreased consciousness. Seeing that your lipsails/skin becomes pale/blue/gray, which can be a sign that you are not getting enough oxygen. The CDC released new guidelines for isolating when sick with COVID-19 in early 2024. Do these guidelines apply to other respiratory illnesses? The short answer is yes. These new recommendations aren’t technically COVID- or virus-specific, but rather the CDC issued a Respiratory Virus Guidance to be a “practical” approach to address these health risks for the general public. This guidance does not apply to health care settings. Respiratory viruses typically spread from respiratory droplets, like sneezing into the air without covering your mouth, and from hand-to-hand contact. You are typically less contagious if your symptoms are getting better overall and you have not had a fever for 24 hours (and are not taking a medication that can reduce your fever). Even if you feel better, you can still spread an illness. Once you go back to your normal activities, medical experts say you should still be mindful for the next five days to curb the spread. You can do that by socially distancing yourself from others, wearing a mask and thoroughly washing your hands.

Experts will discuss the risks, increases in cases, and what we can do to protect ourselves.Globally and domestically, infectious diseases are on the rise. This summer, the World Health Organization declared mpox a global health emergency. Earlier this year in the U.S., H5N1 bird flu spread from cows to dairy farm workers, and recently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed a case in which the virus was contracted by a human without known animal exposure. As we transition from summer to fall, cases of parvovirus B19 and seasonal influenza continue to increase, with the fall flu season expected to arrive as early as October. Additionally, COVID-19 cases are anticipated to increase between November and January. The live briefing will take place from 9:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, October 2, via Zoom and will feature two experts from the Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Scott Nolen and Malinda Larkin September 24, 2024 Updated September 24, 2024 The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI, more specifically avian influenza type A H5N1), continues among U.S. dairy cattle after its initial discovery in that species this spring. Since March, H5N1 outbreaks have been confirmed in dairy cattle in over 200 herds. This includes 34 dairy cow operations in California, making it 14th state with dairy herds that have tested positive for the virus. Testing culled dairy cattle beef The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been testing raw milk from cows to identify the virus in herds. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has separately tested commercial milk supplies and cites federal agency research showing that pasteurization kills the virus. The disease is unpredictable, however, as it has shown up in the milk of asymptomatic dairy cattle, as well as those that show a high number of clinical signs over an extended period of time, according to Dr. Sarah Tomlinson, associate deputy administrator for strategy and policy at USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s (APHIS) Veterinary Services. Now, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has announced that it will add H5N1 influenza to its national surveillance program monitoring beef for pathogens and chemical contaminants. With outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in dairy cow herds in 14 states, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other federal agencies continue their efforts to ensure a safe food supply and the health of these animals and the farm workers. Starting September 16, FSIS began testing for avian influenza type A H5N1 in dairy cattle carcasses as part of its National Residue Program (NRP) to ensure the safety of beef for human consumption and to detect the virus’s presence in asymptomatic cows, according to an August 13 FSIS notice. The NRP is an interagency program that tests meat, poultry, and egg products for a wide range of chemical resides and contaminants, including veterinary drugs and pesticides. The H5N1 testing program follows three separate studies conducted by the USDA demonstrating the safety of U.S. beef. In August, the FDA released the results of a second retail sampling survey that tested 167 dairy products for H5N1. According to an analysis coordinated by the USDA, no viable H5N1 virus was detected in any of the products, which included pasteurized milk, products made from pasteurized milk, and aged raw milk cheese. Over the next year, FSIS will use the NRP to test 800 skeletal muscle samples collected from dairy cow carcasses at slaughter. Samples will be analyzed by FSIS laboratory staff members using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, the notice states. Carcasses will be held by slaughter facilities pending results. Testing will not require additional holding time for carcasses beyond current NRP protocols, according to the notice. Carcasses that test positive for H5N1 will not be introduced into the food supply, the FSIS notice states. Instead, they will be purchased by the USDA for research purposes. APHIS may also conduct additional traceback activities to gather epidemiological data and prevent the spread of H5N1. “AABP is supportive of any efforts that help us identify the scope of this disease outbreak,” said Dr. Fred Gingrich, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners. “The other thing about that plan,” Dr. Gingrich continued, “is it will identify animals that are infected at the time of slaughter. That’s important because it helps our industry maintain consumer confidence, especially since any of those animals that are being sampled will not go into the commercial meat supply, even though FSIS has already determined cooking beef appropriately poses no risk to the consuming public.” California cases growing Federal and state governments have already implemented various measures to prevent the spread of the virus, including import restrictions and a negative H5N1 test for out-of-state transport. However, the virus continues to spread, most recently in California, which is the nation’s top milk-producing state with more than 1,100 dairy farms housing 1.72 million milk cows. Cattle at three dairies located in the state’s Central Valley began showing clinical signs consistent with HPAI beginning August 23-25, according to a statement from the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). Following an investigation by the CDFA and rapid disease detection by California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System (CAHFS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed HPAI in these three dairies. Since then, a total of 34 affected dairies in Central California have also had confirmed cases. Seven of the newer HPAI-confirmed dairies were in a group targeted for testing because of elevated risks from their recent connections with the initial affected premises. “We have been preparing for this eventuality since earlier this year, when HPAI detections were confirmed at dairy farms in other states,” CDFA Secretary Karen Ross said in a statement. “Our extensive experience with HPAI in poultry has given us ample preparation and expertise to address this incident, with workers’ health and public health as our top priorities.” As of September 20, H5N1 outbreaks have previously been confirmed in dairy cattle in 13 other states: 64 herds in Colorado, 31 in Idaho, 29 in Michigan, 26 in Texas, 13 in Iowa, nine each in Minnesota and New Mexico, seven in South Dakota, six in California, four in Kansas, two in Oklahoma, and one each in North Carolina, Ohio, and Wyoming. Those figures likely don’t represent a fully accurate total, as public health and veterinarians have acknowledged that producers are reluctant to report cases for fear of disrupting operations. That’s despite the USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) expanding its Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-raised Fish Program (ELAP) this summer to assist with a portion of financial losses resulting from reduced milk production when cattle are removed from commercial milking in dairy herds having a confirmed positive H5N1 test. Lindsey Holstrom, national incident coordinator at USDA APHIS’s Veterinary Services, spoke at a panel discussion on HPAI during AVMA Convention 2024 this past June in Austin, Texas. She said biosecurity is key to mitigate the risk of disease. Research by the agency found that 50% to 85% of affected premises had frequent visitors who had contact with cattle, 51% moved cattle using trucks or tailers shared with other farms, and 27% had received cattle within 30 days of clinical signs. “What we have learned from poultry is you can have spread of indirect contacts. There’s not one thing we can change for how this virus spreads,” she said. “No one anticipated this would jump to dairy. We’re still learning about transmission and virology and pathogenesis in the cows themselves. … There’s still a lot we’re trying to learn and how to eliminate from dairy cattle. We’re trying to help farmers manage the disease on their premises.” Vaccine testing In related news, the USDA’s Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) is beginning field trials to determine the safety and efficacy of the first ever vaccine for H5N1 in cattle. Before the USDA notice, the only way companies could test a vaccine for H5N1 was in biosafety level-3 laboratories. “Field studies to support licensure of nonviable, non-replicating vaccines may be conducted outside of containment without terminal disposal of milk and other commodities,” the August 28 notice states, allowing companies that are developing H5N1 vaccines to perform studies quicker, and for USDA to get a vaccine approved sooner. According to a June 12 report by Reuters, at least 24 companies were working to develop an avian flu vaccine for cattle—including Zoetis, which started developing a vaccine for dairy cattle in spring, and Merck Animal Health. A version of this story appears in the November 2024 print issue of JAVMA Learn more about the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC), and Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) response efforts to H5N1 in dairy cattle. The AVMA website also has up-to-date information on avian influenza and its epidemiology in the United States. 15th human case of avian influenza confirmed Health officials are trying to determine how a human who had no connection to dairy or poultry farming became infected with avian influenza (HPAI, more specifically avian influenza type A H5N1). So far, 15 human cases have been reported since 2022. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed on September 6 that a human case of H5N1 occurred in Missouri. The case was identified through that state’s seasonal flu surveillance system. An investigation into the potential exposure is ongoing by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS), according to the CDC. Missouri DHSS reported that the patient, who was hospitalized, had underlying medical conditions, was treated with influenza antiviral medications, and has recovered. Of the 15 human cases reported in the U.S., 10 have been connected to exposure to poultry and four connected to exposure to dairy cows. This is the first case without a known occupational exposure to sick or infected animals. H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle have not been reported in Missouri but have been reported in commercial and backyard poultry flocks this year. The agency still maintains that the risk to the general public from H5N1 remains low but says that, as always, circumstances may change quickly as more information becomes available. “The results of this investigation will be particularly important in light of the current lack of an obvious animal exposure. It is important to note that, while rare, there have been novel influenza A cases where an animal source cannot be identified. The main concern in these situations is that no onward transmission is occurring. Findings from the ongoing investigation will inform whether guidance changes are needed,” the CDC announcement stated.

Download PDF Copy By Dr. Sanchari Sinha Dutta, Ph.D.Sep 25 2024 Scientists have uncovered alarming evidence of H5N1’s rapid adaptation to mammals fueled by genetic mutations. With mammal-to-mammal transmission now confirmed, could this be the precursor to the next global pandemic? Review: The global H5N1 influenza panzootic in mammals. Image Credit: Rui Duarte / Shutterstock In a review article published in the journal Nature, the authors describe molecular and ecological factors associated with the sudden expansion of H5N1 high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in mammals. Background Influenza A viruses are associated with most of the documented global pandemics in human history. High pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses belonging to the H5N1 subtype are a leading risk factor for future pandemics. The evolutionary barriers to mammalian adaptation of these viruses are lower than previously thought, as shown by rapid mutation accumulation in key viral proteins. H5N1 viruses were initially detected only in Asian poultries during the past two decades. However, in recent years, a rapid transmission of these viruses into new mammal species has been observed worldwide, endangering wildlife, agricultural production, and human health. Mammal-to-mammal transmission confirmed: Evidence from mink farms, marine mammals, and dairy cattle outbreaks show that H5N1 is now capable of spreading directly between mammals, a crucial evolutionary leap. Such rapid viral transmission started after the emergence of a new genotype of H5N1 viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b, which infected wild birds from Europe to Africa, North America, South America, and the Antarctic. These viruses arose from genomic reassortment between the H5N8 and low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, generating new hybrid strains. The genomic reassortment event between 2.3.4.4b H5N8 and low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses gave rise to the panzootic 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses, which are genetically different from prior strains. This reassortment involved the polymerase gene and surface proteins, facilitating rapid adaptation to new environments. The panzootic 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses can silently transmit to new countries or continents through migrating aquatic wild birds. This may result in mass die-offs among social sea birds congregating in large, dense colonies. Birds of prey or animals that eat dead H5N1-infected birds can also die due to neurological disorders. Viral spillover to mammals has been linked to several adaptive mutations that enhance viral replication in mammalian hosts, specifically within the polymerase (PB2) and hemagglutinin (HA) genes. In this review article, the authors discuss influenza A virus spillover and H5N1 pandemic potential by analyzing three H5N1 case studies demonstrating mammal-to-mammal transmission. The article provides information on the acquisition of key adaptive mutations that enabled 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses to sustain mammal-to-mammal transmission. The authors have collected this information from three real-world settings: the 2022-2023 H5N1 outbreaks on European fur farms, the 2023 South American marine mammal-adapted virus, and the 2024 US dairy cattle outbreak. H5N1 outbreaks on European fur farms The evidence collected from H5N1-infected European farmed animals (American mink, arctic foxes, and raccoon dogs) revealed the presence of known mammalian-adaptive mutations in the PB2 gene, particularly the PB2 E627K mutation, which enhances viral replication in mammals. Mammal-to-mammal transmission was suspected based on the close genetic relatedness of the viruses found on different farms. Experimental studies confirmed the effective transmission of the viruses between ferrets in direct contact. This genetic proximity is consistent with sustained transmission driven by adaptive changes in the polymerase complex. Farm-to-farm transmission most probably occurred due to the movement of contaminated equipment, clothing, or infected carcasses fed to other mink. The new reassortant H5N1 genotype, “BB,” which emerged in 2022, represents a hybrid virus combining genome segments from prior H5N1 and LPAI gull-adapted viruses. This genotype caused mass die-offs in black-headed gulls throughout Europe. Rapid virus spread: Migratory birds are playing a critical role in spreading the virus across continents, silently transmitting the disease to new regions and species. Genetic sequencing revealed that the H5N1 viruses belong to a new reassortant H5N1 genotype, “BB,” that emerged in 2022 and caused mass die-offs in black-headed gulls throughout Europe. An H5N1 outbreak also occurred in Poland in mid-2023, killing more than 30 domestic cats. Raw pet foods sourced from mink farms were assumed to be a potential source of the virus. Sequencing of cat-derived H5N1 viruses revealed identical mammalian adaptations absent in avian viruses circulating in Europe at the time. The cat-derived H5N1 viruses shared identical mammalian-adaptive mutations in PB2 (E627K, D701N), highlighting the virus’s ability to adapt across different mammalian hosts. H5N1 outbreaks in South American marine mammals A new reassortant H5N1 genotype B3.2 arrived from North America to South America in late 2022, causing mass die-offs in coastal birds and marine mammals. Genetic sequencing of H5N1 viruses from South American marine mammals identified the same known mammalian adaptations (PB2 D701N and Q591K) and other distinctive mutations absent in birds, supporting mammal-to-mammal transmission. The B3.2 viruses in the marine mammal clade were also identified in South American sea lions, common dolphins, Chilean dolphins, porpoises, sea otters, fur seals, elephant seals, and one human. These mutations allowed the virus to exploit mammalian cellular machinery, facilitating sustained transmission in a mammalian host. The hospitalized man resided near a beach with H5N1-infected animals, and the virus derived from the infected man also contained the same two mammalian adaptations found in pinnipeds, indicating the environmental mode of transmission of the virus. A spillback of mammalian-adapted B3.2 viruses from marine mammals to wild birds was also observed in South America. However, no reversions were observed in the mammalian-adapted PB2 mutations, demonstrating the virus’s strong adaptation to mammalian hosts. H5N1 outbreaks in US dairy cattle The H5N1 viruses belonging to the B3.13 genotype were identified as causative pathogens associated with Texas dairy cattle outbreaks in 2024. Phylogenetic analysis showed a single viral introduction from wild birds into cattle. Mammalian-adaptive mutations PB2 M631L and PA K497R were detected in the cattle clade, facilitating increased replication in mammalian cells. Only four B3.13 genotype viruses were identified in US wildlife apart from the cattle clade, suggesting that this genotype is rare in wild birds. The viruses' high genetic diversity points to rapid local evolution in dairy cattle, providing further evidence of sustained mammalian transmission. The high genetic diversity of the H5N1 virus in Texas cattle suggests that the bovine B3.13 outbreak originated in Texas and rapidly spread to additional states. Transport of infected cattle or equipment was considered the most likely cause of viral transmission. Cattle-origin H5N1 viruses were also identified in other species, including domestic cats, alpacas, wild birds, terrestrial mammals, and poultry. Transmission routes likely include milk contamination due to the virus’s mammary tissue tropism, leading to widespread infection through contaminated milk. Thirteen human cases, including four dairy farm workers, were also identified in the US. Less than 20 human cases of 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses have been documented in Europe and the US since 2020, a low number compared to the H5N1 human cases recorded in Asia and Egypt in 2015. Significance The potency of H5N1 viruses in creating future pandemics remains unknown. Recent human cases with H5N1 2.3.4.4b viruses have significantly lower fatality rates than prior H5N1 outbreaks in Asia. If H5N1 continues spreading in humans, an existing H5 vaccine that is antigenically related to circulating 2.3.4.4b viruses can be scaled up using mRNA platforms. However, the virus’s ability to reassort with other influenza viruses, particularly in high-risk settings such as farms, raises concerns about the potential for more transmissible variants.

Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can lead to severe symptoms, hospitalization, and even death in some cases. However, there are effective strategies to protect yourself during flu season. Get Vaccinated: The flu vaccine is one of the most effective ways to prevent influenza. It helps your body develop immunity against the virus, reducing the likelihood of severe illness. The vaccine is recommended for everyone aged six months and older. Practice Hand Hygiene: Good hand hygiene is vital in preventing the spread of the flu virus. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coughing, sneezing, or touching potentially contaminated surfaces. Email newsletter signup Sign up for our daily email newsletter Follow Respiratory Etiquette: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing to prevent the spread of flu droplets. Properly dispose of tissues and wash your hands immediately. Avoid Close Contact: Keep your distance from people who are sick with the flu. If you are ill, stay home to prevent spreading the virus to others. It’s important to remain at home until you’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the aid of fever-reducing medications. Clean Surfaces Regularly: The flu virus can survive on surfaces for several hours. Regularly disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, and remote controls. Boost Your Immune System: Strengthen your immune system by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, and stress management. Consider Antiviral Medications: If you are at high risk for flu complications, consult with a healthcare professional about antiviral medications. These drugs can be used for prevention or early treatment of the flu. Use Face Masks: In situations where you might be in close contact with others, such as in crowded public places during flu season, wearing a mask can help reduce virus transmission. However, masks should be used alongside other preventive measures. Stay Aware During Flu Season: Be mindful of the flu season in your area and take extra precautions during peak periods. Flu outbreaks can vary in timing and severity, so staying informed is key. Stay Updated: Keep up with the latest flu information and recommendations from reliable sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). These organizations provide guidance on flu prevention and management. Vaccination for High-Risk Groups: Certain groups, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with underlying health conditions, are more susceptible to severe flu complications. It’s particularly important for these individuals and their close contacts to get vaccinated. Implement Workplace Policies: Employers can play a role in flu prevention by encouraging sick employees to stay home and offering on-site vaccination clinics. In conclusion, preventing and avoiding the flu requires a combination of personal responsibility and community efforts. By following these guidelines, you can reduce your risk of contracting and spreading the flu. Annual vaccination, good hygiene, and healthy habits are fundamental in protecting yourself and others. Staying informed and vigilant during flu season is crucial for a healthier, flu-free community. Dr. Jaisingh Rajput is a physician at Regional Medical Center of Central Alabama in Greenville.

A New At-Home COVID-19 and Flu Test Can HelpThis at-home test for COVID-19 and flu can help you figure out what’s causing your symptoms, and how best to treat themYour body aches. Your nose drips. It hurts to swallow. And that tickle in your throat is causing a cough that won’t quit.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyYou know these signs can indicate more than an average cold. But do you have COVID-19, the flu or something else?“Even medical experts don’t rely on symptoms to discriminate between causes of viral illnesses like COVID-19 and the flu,” says microbiologist and pathologist Daniel Rhoads, MD. That’s because COVID-19 and the flu cause similar, overlapping symptoms. Plus, other respiratory viruses can also cause flu-like symptoms.So, what are you to do when you’re feeling sick and you’re not sure what’s behind your illness? Now, a newly authorized, over-the-counter (OTC) combination test for COVID-19 and flu is making it easier to figure out what ails you — all from the comfort of home.What is the at-home COVID-19 and flu test?In February 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for the first (and so far, only) combination OTC test kit that checks for the distinct viruses that cause COVID-19 and flu. The rapid Lucira® by Pfizer COVID-19 & Flu Home Test provides results in 30 minutes.How does it work?The Lucira by Pfizer test works differently from the home tests you may have been using. “Until now, at-home COVID-19 tests were antigen tests,” says Dr. Rhoads. “These tests look for specific antigens, or proteins, that coat the coronavirus.”AdvertisementLucira by Pfizer is a molecular test. It checks for ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules unique to the:SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.Influenza A and B strains that cause seasonal flu.How accurate is the at-home COVID-19 and flu test?It’s accurate but not perfect. According to the FDA, a clinical study showed the Lucira by Pfizer test:Detected SARS-CoV-2 in 88.3% of individuals with symptomatic COVID-19.Detected influenza A in 90% of individuals with symptomatic influenza.Very rarely produced false-positive results, which means a positive result from the testing is very likely to be accurate.How to take the testFrom a user perspective, the combination COVID-19 and flu test works like other at-home COVID-19 tests. You swab both nasal passages with a provided nasal swab and swish the swab around in a vial.But there are some differences. The combo test has a battery-operated device that spins the sample, separating and identifying the virus molecules.Even if you feel like you’re an ace COVID-19 test taker, it’s important to read through each step of the instructions that come with the Lucira by Pfizer test kit before you start. “Directions can vary by test, and manufacturers often make updates,” clarifies Dr. Rhoads.Currently, the Lucira by Pfizer test requires three steps:Swab: Roll the nasal swab five times inside each nostril.Stir: Fully insert the nasal swab into the provided vial and stir it around 15 times. Remove and discard the nasal swab. Close the lid on the vial.Detect: Press the vial into the test device until you hear a click. The device’s ready light will blink while the test runs. After 30 minutes, lights on the device will show if you’re negative or positive for influenza A or B or COVID-19.People 14 and older can perform the test themselves. Adults should test children between 2 and 13 years old.When should you use the combination at-home COVID-19 and flu test?Test for COVID-19 and the flu as soon as you have symptoms, advises Dr. Rhoads. “Symptoms indicate your body has recognized an infection is underway and you could be actively shedding the virus — and that would be contagious.”Where can I get it?You can buy the combination at-home COVID-19 and flu test at your local drugstore or online. The Lucira by Pfizer test typically costs between $40 and $50. You may be able to purchase the test with funds from a Health Savings Account (HSA). You can also contact your health insurer to see if they’ll reimburse you.What should I do if I test positive for COVID-19 or the flu?It depends on how sick you feel and if you have conditions like asthma or heart disease that put you at risk for serious illness or hospitalization. “Antiviral medications for COVID-19 and influenza antiviral medications can lessen symptom severity, lowering your risk for hospitalization,” says Dr. Rhoads.AdvertisementAntivirals work best when taken within 48 hours of symptoms starting. This is another good reason to use the combination test: You’ll know which virus you have, so you can get the right medicine.If you’re low risk for complications and have mild-to-moderate symptoms, these steps can protect others from exposure and relieve your symptoms:Isolate from others when experiencing symptoms.Wear a face mask if you have to be around people at home or in public.Try at-home COVID-19 treatments like rest, hydration and OTC medications to ease symptoms. (These therapies work for the flu, too.)Is there an at-home combination COVID-19-flu-RSV test?Sort of, but it’s a bit more involved and doesn’t give you immediate results. Pixel from Labcorp is the only FDA-approved self-collected test for COVID-19, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These three respiratory viruses cause similar symptoms. But there are differences, including who’s most at risk and how providers treat them.The 3-in-1 test isn’t available in pharmacies. You need to order the kit online (but you don’t need a prescription). When the kit arrives, follow the instructions to do the test. You then mail the nasal swab sample back to the laboratory for testing and get results in a couple days. The $129 test is approved for ages 2 and older.AdvertisementLower your risk of COVID-19 and fluWith flu season approaching and COVID-19 peaking around the same time, at-home tests make it easier to pinpoint the cause of your symptoms in real time. The bonus: Increasing your awareness about your symptoms and what’s causing them likely will reduce your chances of exposing others to the same infections.Still, it’s best not to need the test at all. “The flu vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine and RSV vaccine remain the best ways to protect yourself from severe illnesses caused by these viruses,” confirms Dr. Rhoads. And clinical trial findings suggest that a combination COVID-19-flu vaccine that’s in development may be more effective than separate vaccinations. This vaccine may be available in 2025.AdvertisementLearn more about our editorial process.Health LibraryCOVID-19 and PCR TestingOverviewTest DetailsResults and Follow-UpAdditional DetailsHealth LibraryCOVID-19 and PCR TestingOverviewTest DetailsResults and Follow-UpAdditional DetailsAdvertisementRelated ArticlesNovember 11, 2024/Infectious DiseaseFLiRT COVID Variants: What To KnowThe latest omicron subvariants carry specific mutations that may allow the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be better at evading immune protectionNovember 7, 2024/Infectious DiseaseCan COVID-19 Cause Erectile Dysfunction?Research shows the virus can affect your ability to get or maintain an erectionOctober 29, 2024/Children's HealthRSV vs. Pneumonia: Sorting out Your Child’s Fever and CoughRSV can lead your child to develop pneumonia and have trouble breathingOctober 25, 2024/Children's HealthDoes Your Child Have RSV?

Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. SAN DIEGO, Sept. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CDTX), a biotechnology company using its proprietary Cloudbreak® platform to develop drug-Fc conjugate (DFC) immunotherapies designed to save lives and improve the standard of care for patients facing serious diseases, today announced two presentations at OPTIONS XII for the Control of Influenza conference, to be held September 29 through October 2, 2024 in Brisbane, Australia. The presentations, one oral and one poster, will highlight safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data from clinical studies of CD388, Cidara’s influenza drug-Fc conjugate (DFC) candidate. “We are pleased to have the opportunity to present at this year’s OPTIONS XII conference and share the clinical data on our universally active influenza preventative, CD388,” said Jeffrey Stein, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Cidara. “These data support the safety of CD388 administered over a range of doses via multiple routes of administration. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic data support the potential use of CD388 in immune compromised as well as immune competent populations to provide season-long protection against influenza A and B.” Oral PresentationTitle: Safety Data from Phase 1 and Phase 2a Studies of CD388, a Drug Fc-conjugate for Seasonal Pan-Influenza ProphylaxisPresenter: Taylor Sandison, MD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer, Cidara Therapeutics Date/Time: Tuesday, October 1, 2024, 15:51–16:04 AEST This presentation summarizes the safety data from three CD388 clinical trials that involved 108 subjects who were followed for approximately 5–14 months. There were no dose-, route- or repeat-dose-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Overall, CD388 administered via subcutaneous or intramuscular injection was safe and well-tolerated in all three clinical trials. These data support further clinical studies with CD388 for single-dose prevention of seasonal influenza. Poster PresentationTitle: Pharmacokinetics and Safety of CD388 Following Subcutaneous Administration in Healthy Japanese ParticipantsPresenter: Taylor Sandison, MD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer, Cidara Therapeutics Date/Time: Sunday, September 29, 18:30-20:30 AEST This presentation summarizes the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety data of 27 healthy volunteers of Japanese descent dosed subcutaneously with a single dose of CD388 (50, 150, or 450 mg) or placebo. Overall PK parameters showed low-to-moderate variability across all doses and were similar to results from a previous Phase 1 clinical study in Western participants. Safety observations were comparable across the study arms. There were no clinically significant treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE). These data support further clinical studies with CD388 in the Japanese population for prevention of seasonal influenza. About CD388CD388 is an investigational drug-Fc conjugate (DFC) comprised of multiple copies of a potent small molecule neuraminidase inhibitor stably conjugated to a proprietary Fc fragment of a human antibody. DFCs are not vaccines or monoclonal antibodies but are low molecular weight biologics which are designed to function as long-acting small molecule inhibitors. CD388 was designed to provide universal protection against all known strains of seasonal and pandemic influenza with the potential to provide season-long protection with a single subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. Importantly, because CD388 is not a vaccine, its activity is not reliant on an immune response and thereby is expected to be efficacious in individuals regardless of immune status. More information can be found at: https://www.cidara.com/cloudbreak/influenza/. About Cidara TherapeuticsCidara Therapeutics is using its proprietary Cloudbreak® platform to develop novel drug-Fc conjugates (DFCs) comprising targeted small molecules or peptides coupled to a proprietary human antibody fragment (Fc). Cidara’s lead DFC candidate, CD388, is a long-acting antiviral designed to achieve universal prevention of seasonal and pandemic influenza with a single dose by directly inhibiting viral proliferation. In June 2023, CD388 was granted Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Company plans to advance CD388 into a Phase 2b trial in the 2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. Additional DFCs have been developed for oncology and in July 2024 Cidara received IND clearance for CBO421 which will be developed to target CD73 in solid tumors.

Here’s What We Know and Don’t Know | Scientific American Skip to main contentScientific AmericanSeptember 26, 20249 min readSecond Health Care Worker Exposed to Person with Bird Flu Had Symptoms. Here’s What We Know and Don’t KnowExperts call for greater testing of contacts of a person who was infected with the H5N1 bird flu strain before the virus causes a wider outbreakBy Tanya LewisTEM (transmission electron micrograph) of Avian influenza A H5N1 viruses (seen in brown) grown in MDCK cells (seen in purple). Scott Camazine/Alamy Stock PhotoEditor’s Note (10/24/24): A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson said in a press briefing today that a total of five additional health care workers in Missouri who developed mild respiratory symptoms after contact with a hospitalized person with confirmed H5N1 infection have tested negative for H5N1 antibodies, ruling out person-to-person transmission. The index case and the household contact both tested positive for neutralizing antibodies, but prior H5N1 infection was not detected on two other types of assays. The household contact did not meet the qualifications for a positive case but was likely exposed or infected at the same time as the index case, from the same source, the CDC official said.A second health care worker in Missouri reported respiratory illness symptoms—but was not tested—after being exposed to a hospitalized person who tested positive for the H5N1 strain of avian influenza a few weeks ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced last week. H5N1 has recently been infecting U.S. dairy cows and several farm workers. Previously in the case in Missouri, another health care worker and a household contact of the infected person developed symptoms, although that health care worker tested negative. The household contact wasn’t tested but got sick at the same time as the person who had tested positive. Details of the Missouri case remain somewhat mysterious—and experts say the lack of information being shared about the investigation is troubling.It’s certainly possible that the second health care worker was sick with a different respiratory virus; a lot of COVID has been going around. But there hasn’t been much transparency into the Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services’ efforts to rule out possible human-to-human transmission of H5N1, a highly pathogenic bird flu strain that has raised fears of a potential pandemic. In last week’s announcement, the CDC said blood samples from the infected person in Missouri and their household contact are being sent to the agency to test for antibodies to the virus (a lab process called serology). It also said that the second health care worker “will be offered” serological testing. That person and any additional contacts of the individual who had bird flu should definitely be tested for previous infection, says Seema Lakdawala, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the Emory University School of Medicine.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

The CDC is providing assistance, but to send a response team, it must be invited by the state—and so far, that doesn’t appear to have happened. In a statement to Scientific American, the Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services wrote that it “continues to investigate and respond to the confirmed human case of avian influenza A (H5N1) in the state, along with our local public health and clinical partners and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.… The investigation is ongoing and there remains no evidence to suggest person-to-person transmission at this time. Relevant updates are being shared only as components of the follow-up are completed to avoid misinformation or confusion.”*We spoke with Lakdawala and Rasmussen about what is known about the Missouri case so far and what public health officials need to know to prevent bird flu from becoming another pandemic.[An edited transcript of the interviews follow.]What do we know about the second health care worker in Missouri?SEEMA LAKDAWALA: There was a subsequent health care worker who had some interaction with this H5-positive case in Missouri. The interaction was not clear; the duration was not clear. And it’s unclear how long after that interaction the worker developed symptoms but was never tested. It’s unclear whether this is an influenza infection or just some other respiratory infection. There is a lot of COVID still transmitting around the country right now, so I don’t think we can rule out another respiratory infection.ANGELA RASMUSSEN: It’s a really disturbing and also puzzling situation. We still actually just don’t have a lot of information about the time line here. The initial patient was identified through the state [influenza] surveillance program. So when they were in the hospital, they tested positive for influenza A, and then it was sent out to determine the viral subtype, which returned the H5 diagnosis. It’s not clear what time line that happened on. When these health care workers were ill, if they weren’t that sick, it’s hard to say if they would have been tested for flu because it’s not clear that it was known that the patient initially had bird flu. You can second-guess that everybody should have been tested, but that’s not really routinely how it works when somebody just has influenza. And I don’t think anybody expected to identify that this patient was infected with H5.Is there a way to test this person for previous exposure to H5N1?LAKDAWALA: We really need to understand how many people potentially were exposed or became infected from this individual. And I think serology is our best bet at this point for all contacts, not just those who reported symptoms—both health care workers as well as the housemates of this individual and any other people they had possible interactions with for prolonged periods of time—just to ensure that there weren’t suspected infections or that these were real forward transmission events or not.RASMUSSEN: Missouri said that they are considering doing serological testing. I mean that is a situation where, when you hear about this and there was no test performed, you are getting that patient’s blood, and you are driving it to [the CDC’s headquarters in] Atlanta yourself. I mean, that is a really serious thing.Why has there been such a delay in getting information about this case?LAKDAWALA: So my understanding from that case is that [the original patient] tested positive because they arrived at the hospital, and it took a few weeks to determine that it was H5 in their sample. It was a few weeks because the case [was logged] in the novel influenza surveillance network that the person tested positive for influenza A, but it was not subtyped. Then they kept going to figure out what the subtype was, and that took a few weeks. But by the time it was caught, the patient had a very low level of virus. They were hospitalized for some of their other underlying conditions, and presumably the virus was made more severe because of that.RASMUSSEN: In my view, here’s what should have happened. I mean, nobody was notified about the initial patient until weeks after they had been in the hospital. And some of that may have been delays, just because they weren’t expecting to get it, and it takes some time to get results back. But for this surveillance program to work, especially for things like rare human cases of H5N1, a lot of this testing needs to happen more expediently, and there needs to be more rapid disclosure of cases that are testing positive for H5.What does this say about the U.S. response to a potentially major public health threat?LAKDAWALA: What I have been amazed to learn in all of this is how much role state public health agencies have in these sorts of cases when there’s a novel influenza virus. At least on the agricultural side, the U.S. Department of Agriculture cannot go in and test every farm. It has to be invited.Are we not getting any information out of Missouri because the Missouri public health department isn’t well equipped? Or maybe they didn’t initiate something quickly enough? Or maybe they are doing it, but they’re just not giving that information.The investigation relies on state public health funds, and some states may be better equipped than other states. But if we aren’t, as a society, prioritizing public health readiness for pandemics—which we all should be, because as we learned in 2019 and 2020, they do not know any state boundaries—we are all susceptible. We really need to do better about funding our public health agencies so that they are well equipped to respond in a case of an outbreak.The person in Missouri who tested positive for H5N1 reportedly had no contact with animals, and Missouri hasn’t reported any cow herds that are positive. But do we really know no cows there are infected?LAKDAWALA: How do we how many cattle herds have even been tested in Missouri? We’re saying that there are no known ones because they haven't been reported.What should happen now?LAKDAWALA: The thing that is bothering me the most is that, this many months after the first cases in Texas, we do not know how many herds are infected in this country. We have no idea about the scope of the outbreak in cattle. Not only do we not know how many herds are positive, but we’re not [always] testing individual cows.Sick cows may just be mixing in with the herds, so you’re getting continuous spread of the virus on the farm because we’re not identifying cows that are infected and then isolating them. If you isolated them because you knew they were infected, you could then take better precautions to prevent cattle-to-cattle transmission on the farm and spillover to humans.RASMUSSEN: It’s entirely possible that the health care worker in Missouri does not have H5, but that can easily be determined with serological testing, and that needs to happen, like, yesterday. Because if this does represent human-to-human transmission of H5N1, then time is of the essence in terms of containing it. There needs to be a detailed epidemiological investigation done. There needs to be way more testing of contacts, both testing for flu directly, as well as serology testing to see if people have been exposed in the past—because if there is a cluster of undetected community transmission, we’re in real trouble unless that can be contained as fast as possible.In order to do this testing and to do it in a reasonable way, there needs to be adequate communication between the Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services and the CDC. And there needs to be rapid and timely disclosure of this because this is certainly not creating a lot of confidence in terms of how this response is going to go if this is the worst-case scenario, and there is human-to-human transmission of H5. If you can detect the outbreak while it’s still limited in terms of its geography and the number of people who might have been exposed to it, then you can use isolation and quarantine to contain the outbreak and prevent it from spreading. But if you don’t hurry to do that, then you end up with undetected community transmission. And by the time you realize what’s going on, the outbreak might be too big to contain.The U.S. has a stockpile of H5N1 vaccines. Why are we not giving them to dairy farm workers? Instead the CDC has merely recommended that workers get the seasonal flu vaccine.RASMUSSEN: One thing that I and many of my colleagues are sort of perplexed about is that dairy workers and people who are extremely high-risk are not being offered vaccines. What’s not clear is what the criteria are for deploying human H5N1 vaccines. I think that there is plenty of justification scientifically. There’s plenty of evidence that this should be offered to dairy workers, but it’s not.And also, why isn’t there a discussion on the table of vaccinating the cows? I realize that we do have a lot of chickens and cows in the U.S., but veterinary vaccines also have a much lower bar for regulatory approval. So it does seem to me that that’s something that should be more on the table than it is. [Editor’s note: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved field studies to test H5N1 vaccines in cows, but these are in the early stages.]I do think it’s a good idea that the CDC is launching this campaign to encourage seasonal flu vaccination among dairy workers—not because that would necessarily protect against H5N1, though there is potentially some protection that they would get from boosting N1 antibodies, but because it might reduce the risk of reassortment. [Editor’s Note: Such reassortment is the shuffling of pieces of influenza virus that happens when a person is coinfected with two different flu strains, which can result in a more virulent and transmissible virus.] I think offering high-risk people seasonal flu vaccines does offer some protection against that sort of nightmare scenario where a fully pandemic-capable reassortment emerges from a coinfected person—but it still doesn’t really offer them protection against H5.*Editor’s Note (9/30/24): This paragraph was updated after posting to include a statement from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.Rights & PermissionsTanya Lewis is a senior editor covering health and medicine at Scientific American.

(Image credit: MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images / Contributor via Getty Images) A nasal spray version of the annual flu vaccine can now be taken at home, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says.In a statement published Sept. 20, the FDA announced that it had approved the nasal spray influenza vaccine, called FluMist, for use at home. This allows people ages 18 to 49 to self-administer the vaccine — meaning they spray it up their own nose. The vaccine is also cleared for children and adolescents ages 2 to 17, whose caregivers can administer the spray.FluMist was previously available for people ages 2 to 49 in the U.S., but it could be administered only by professionals in health care settings, such as pharmacies and doctors' offices. The FDA's new announcement comes after clinical trial data showed that FluMist was easy to self-administer and that it was just as safe and effective to vaccinate this way as it was by health care professionals.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that, except in rare circumstances, everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine each season — ideally between September and October, before the flu starts circulating widely. The new approval could make vaccination more convenient, flexible and accessible, Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in the statement.Related: 2-in-1 shot for flu and COVID shows promise in advanced trial"Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death," Marks said. "This approval adds another option for vaccination against influenza disease and demonstrates the FDA's commitment to advancing public health."Here's what we know so far about using FluMist at home.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.What is FluMist?FluMist is a nasal spray-based vaccine that helps prevent illness caused by two types of flu, known as influenza A and B. These virus types are responsible for most flu infections in humans.FluMist is a live, attenuated vaccine, meaning it contains weakened versions of influenza A and B viruses. These weakened viruses cannot cause the flu; instead, they prime the immune system to produce antibodies to fight off future infections.FluMist first gained FDA approval in 2003, for use in people ages 5 to 49. In 2007, this approval was expanded to include children as young as 2. Until now, FluMist could be administered only by health care providers in pharmacies and other health care facilities.FluMist is the only non-injected flu vaccine available to people in the U.S. For the 2024-2025 flu season, FluMist and all of the other approved vaccines will guard against three subtypes of flu: two influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus.How do you use FluMist?FluMist is administered via one spray in each nostril. The vaccine is packaged in a small tube with a plunger on one end. The end of the tube opposite the plunger goes into the nose, and then you push the plunger to release the spray, emptying one half of the tube's contents into each nostril.People ages 9 and older require only one dose of the vaccine per year — meaning one spritz in each nostril. However, children ages 2 to 8 may need an additional dose at least a month later. This depends on the child's vaccination history; children who haven't gotten at least two doses previously or whose vaccination history is unknown need two doses.In these instances, your health care provider can help determine whether your child needs a second dose.The FluMist vaccine may not be available to order for home delivery until fall 2025. (Image credit: Albany Times Union/Hearst Newspapers / Contributor via Getty Images)How do I order FluMist?Although the FDA has approved FluMist for use at home, it will take some time for the spray to be available for home delivery.The vaccine's maker, AstraZeneca, said it anticipates the vaccine will be available to order for home delivery through a third-party online pharmacy service in time for the 2025-2026 flu season. The FDA notes you still need a prescription for FluMist — in this case, that means a pre-approved prescription provided by an online pharmacist.Is there anyone who shouldn't get FluMist?There are several groups of people who should not get a FluMist vaccine, according to the CDC. They include individuals who are pregnant and those with weakened immune systems. These precautions are taken because the FluMist vaccine contains live (albeit weakened) viruses, while flu shot options do not.Although not everyone can use FluMist, it is hoped that the new approval will make needle-free options for flu vaccines available to more people.RELATED STORIES—A branch of the flu family tree has died and won't be included in future US vaccines—Is it too late to get a flu shot?—China approves world-first inhaled COVID-19 vaccine"It's very exciting to see the FDA take this step and find one more way to make it easy for people to get vaccines," said Dr. Andrew Handel, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Stony Brook Children's Hospital in New York.It's possible that the new approval may even inspire pharmaceutical companies to pursue the development of nasal vaccines for other respiratory infections, such as COVID-19, he told Live Science.This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

They met during the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture meeting in Indianapolis.Russell Redding, the Pennsylvania ag secretary, said he wasn’t trying to blame the uncertainty on a particular agency.USDA, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are all trying to determine who is responsible for what, he said.But Redding said dairy processors need consensus on how to approach avian influenza testing. He said he’s gotten mixed answers from national leaders on that issue.USDA’s decision not to depopulate infected dairy herds signaled early on that the influenza outbreaks in cows would be handled differently than the poultry cases.By the time the agency required influenza testing for dairy cattle prior to interstate movement in April, many states had already set up their own restrictions.USDA recently added testing of dairy cows at slaughter.But there’s no federal mandate for bulk tank surveillance testing, which could speed up the identification of new cases in new places.To fill the gap, some states have implemented their own voluntary or required testing programs, but Redding isn’t satisfied with this piecemeal approach.“There shouldn’t be 50 flavors of this thing,” he said.USDA believes it is taking all appropriate measures to understand and eventually eliminate influenza in dairy cattle, a spokesperson said.In May, the agency launched a voluntary weekly bulk milk testing program open to all dairy farms, but USDA does not believe such testing needs to be mandated, the spokesperson said.No Northeastern states are among the 14 where farms have tested positive, but new detections could threaten the region’s important dairy and poultry industries.Still, voluntary milk testing programs have not gotten many takers.Even with the state covering testing costs, only six of Pennsylvania’s 4,900 dairy farms are enrolled in the bulk tank monitoring program.One processor is submitting samples from another 80 or so farms, said Shannon Powers, an Ag Department spokeswoman.Pasteurization breaks down the virus, so people can’t get influenza from drinking mass-market milk.But Shawn Jasper, the New Hampshire ag commissioner, said cooperatives have been guarded about how they would handle a farm that tests positive.The only way Jasper sees to increase testing participation is to get stronger assurances from processors.“It doesn’t seem that the milk cooperatives are really giving the answer that the farms need to hear, that they’re not going to be shut off,” Jasper said.Ashley Randle, the Massachusetts ag commissioner, said Agri-Mark and Dairy Farmers of America have committed to continued support for farms.“That gave a little bit more assurance to the producers, but there still remains a concern about if there’s a positive, what happens,” Randle said.Massachusetts started out with voluntary milk testing but made it mandatory when only five farms signed up in the program’s first few weeks.Such low participation was not enough to give a good indication of whether the virus was present, Randle said.The first round of testing found no positives on the state’s 95 dairies.The state added a second and third round given the scale of The Big E show in West Springfield, which attracts livestock from many states in September.The second round of testing is just about done, and the third round will be in October.One of the biggest challenges has been getting staff to the island of Martha’s Vineyard to test the dairies there, Randle said.In Massachusetts, the Department of Public Health is funding the testing in collaboration with Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The state is considering shifting to ongoing testing through Cornell, Randle said.Beyond the testing question, Redding and Scuse are disappointed the U.S. has not acted aggressively to put at-risk dairy workers in personal protective equipment.That laxness compared to the expectations in the poultry industry have contributed to a handful of farm workers catching the disease, Scuse said.Public health experts are concerned about the virus mutating to become more contagious among humans, though that hasn’t happened so far.Despite the complexity of the current situation, Jasper isn’t looking for USDA to mandate more testing.“I don’t know how they would make that work,” he said.This story has been updated with comments from USDA and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.

Influenza-complicated thromboembolism (TE) among patients with severe influenza infection in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with increased risk for longer- duration mechanical ventilation, longer ICU stays, and 90-day mortality, according to study findings published in Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses. Investigators assessed the associated risks and outcomes of influenza complicated TE among patients in the ICU with severe influenza. Complicated cardiovascular disease, length of ICU and hospital stays, and 90-day mortality rates were primary outcomes. Patients in the ICU with noninfluenza severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) served as a comparator group in measuring outcomes. The investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study from December 2015 through December 2018 at their institution in Chiayi, Taiwan, recruiting consecutive adult ICU patients who experienced TE events. Analysis included 108 patients with severe influenza (median age, 68.5 years; 57% with hypertension; 38% with diabetes), including 85 who did not experience TE events, and a control group of 192 patients with severe CAP (median age, 71.9 years; 31% with hypertension; 48% with diabetes), including 181 who did not experience TE events. Patients diagnosed with severe influenza were admitted to the ICU from outside the hospital after presenting with unstable vital signs due to the infection or with respiratory insufficiency. The investigators found that patients in the ICU with severe influenza vs those with severe CAP had: lower mean scores on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, (17.4 vs 20.4; P <.05), lower mechanical ventilation support (68.5% vs 97.9%; P <.001), lower rate of progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; 20% vs 56%; P <.001), lower acute kidney injury (14.8% vs 56.3%; P <.001), significantly lower hypertension rates (46% vs 82%; P <.05), lower 90-day mortality (22.2% vs 35.4%; P <.05); and longer mean ICU length of stay (20.85 vs 19.45; P <.05). “Influenza-complicated TE in ICU patients with severe influenza infection is associated with outcomes such as increased risk of longer duration of mechanical ventilation, extended ICU stays, and 90-day mortality. The incidence of TE was notably higher in ICU patients with influenza vs CAP (21.3% vs 5.73%, respectively; P <.05). TE events experienced by those with severe influenza included DVT, pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syndrome, stress cardiomyopathy, and stroke. Hypertension was a significant independent risk factors for the development of TE in ICU patients with both severe influenza (OR, 3.634; 95% CI, 1.065–12.402; P <.05) and severe CAP (OR, 6.157; 95% CI, 1.161–32.637; P <.05). In comparing patients in the ICU with severe influenza with TE to those without TE, investigators found that those with TE had more hypertension (83% vs 52%, respectively; P <.05) and dyslipidemia (26% vs 9%, respectively; P <.05). In comparing outcomes of patients with severe influenza in the ICU who did vs did not develop TE, the investigators noted that those with TE showed significant increases in ICU length of stay, ratio of mechanical ventilation use, length of mechanical ventilation use, and 90-day mortality (all P <.05). In contrast, no significant differences were noted between patients with severe CAP in the ICU who did vs did not develop TE. ICU patients with severe influenza infection had a higher incidence of major vascular complications than did patients with CAP, the investigators noted. Moreover, those with influenza who also had major vascular complications had significantly increased use of mechanical ventilation, longer ICU stays, greater ICU mortality, and greater 90-day mortality, whereas this was not the case in CAP patients with major vascular complications. Risk factors for 90-day mortality among patients with severe influenza in the ICU included complicated TE and the severity of the APACHE II score (P <.05). Study limitations include the retrospective design, limiting generalizability, and the underpowered sample size among patients in the ICU with severe influenza experiencing the onset of TE events. As the study authors concluded, “Influenza-complicated TE in ICU patients with severe influenza infection is associated with outcomes such as increased risk of longer duration of mechanical ventilation, extended ICU stays, and 90-day mortality.” They further added that “Complicated TE and TE-related ICU stays are more likely to occur in this patient population when hypertension is present.” This article originally appeared on Pulmonology Advisor References: Lee WC, Chang CC, Ho MC, et al.

Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 9:00 PM 4 min read In This Article: CDTX The Phase 2b trial will enroll 5,000 subjects across clinical sites in the US and UK SAN DIEGO, Sept. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cidara Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: CDTX), a biotechnology company using its proprietary Cloudbreak® platform to develop drug-Fc conjugate (DFC) immunotherapies designed to save lives and improve the standard of care for patients facing serious diseases, today announced the first subjects dosed in the Phase 2b NAVIGATE trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD388 for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of influenza during the current flu season. The Phase 2b clinical trial is a randomized, double blind, controlled trial targeting 5,000 healthy unvaccinated adult subjects who are not at risk of complications from influenza. Three CD388 dose groups or placebo will be administered to subjects as a single dose at the beginning of the influenza season. Subjects will then be followed for the remainder of the influenza season to monitor for breakthrough cases. Rates of laboratory and clinically confirmed influenza will be compared between subjects receiving the various single doses of CD388 or placebo. The study will include sites in the US and UK. “Effective new options are needed to prevent influenza, particularly for people who do not respond well to seasonal flu vaccines,” said Jeffrey Stein, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Cidara Therapeutics. “Since CD388 is not a vaccine, its activity does not rely upon an immune response and is thereby expected to work regardless of immune status. In addition, CD388 has demonstrated the potential to prevent infection by both seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza A and B. We are pleased to reach this important milestone, and look forward to monitoring the progress of the NAVIGATE study as this year’s flu season unfolds.” About CD388 CD388 is an investigational drug-Fc conjugate (DFC) comprised of multiple copies of a potent small molecule neuraminidase inhibitor stably conjugated to a proprietary Fc fragment of a human antibody. DFCs are not vaccines or monoclonal antibodies but are low molecular weight biologics which are designed to function as long-acting small molecule inhibitors. CD388 was designed to provide universal protection against all known strains of seasonal and pandemic influenza with the potential to provide season-long protection with a single subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. Importantly, because CD388 is not a vaccine, its activity is not reliant on an immune response and thereby is expected to be efficacious in individuals regardless of immune status. More information can be found at: https://www.cidara.com/cloudbreak/influenza/. Story Continues About Cidara TherapeuticsCidara Therapeutics is using its proprietary Cloudbreak® platform to develop novel drug-Fc conjugates (DFCs) comprising targeted small molecules or peptides coupled to a proprietary human antibody fragment (Fc). Cidara’s lead DFC candidate, CD388, is a long-acting antiviral designed to achieve universal prevention of seasonal and pandemic influenza with a single dose by directly inhibiting viral proliferation. In June 2023, CD388 was granted Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Company plans to advance CD388 into a Phase 2b trial in the 2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. Additional DFCs have been developed for oncology and in July 2024 Cidara received IND clearance for CBO421 which will be developed to target CD73 in solid tumors. Cidara is headquartered in San Diego, California. For more information, please visit www.cidara.com.

Back to Healio Key takeaways:Hospitalized older adults are more likely to die from RSV than influenza B, though the risk is similar for influenza A.Improved testing strategies and outreach could lower the risk for death.Older adults’ risk for death when hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus is higher than it is for influenza B but similar to influenza A, according to a study.“Historically, RSV infection has not been regarded as severe a disease in adults as influenza, leading to inconsistent testing strategies for RSV,” Clara L. Clausen, PhD, from Amager and Hvidovre Hospital in Denmark, and colleagues wrote in Open Forum Infectious Diseases. Death risk is higher for older adults with RSV than influenza B. Image: Adobe Stock “Our findings contribute to the mounting evidence that hospitalizations with RSV infections can be equally, if not more, severe and deadly than influenza, especially among older and frail populations,” they wrote.In the United States, the CDC recommends that all patients aged 75 years or older — and anyone aged 60 to 74 years with an increased risk for severe disease — get an RSV vaccine.Clausen and colleagues conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 988 patients hospitalized with RSV (353), influenza A (347) and influenza B (288) at one of three hospitals between March 2016 and April 2020, according to the study.More patients with RSV had comorbities (83% vs. 72% vs. 74%) and pneumonia (41% vs. 29% and 24%) compared with influenza A and B, respectively. The researchers found that RSV was associated with statistically significant higher mortality within 90 days of hospitalization compared with influenza B (OR = 2.16; 95% CI, 1.2-3.87) but not influenza A (OR = 1.38; 95% CI, 0.84-2.29), with higher age and pneumonia also increasing mortality risk.“This highlights the severity and detrimental effects of RSV, which are similar or worse than that of influenza A and B,” Clausen and colleagues wrote. “The results underscore the potential life-threatening nature of RSV. Harmonizing in-hospital testing strategies, increasing awareness and advocating for targeted RSV vaccinating efforts among high-risk groups and older adults is also important.” Published by: Sources/DisclosuresCollapse Source: Clausen CL, et al.

UnsubscribeBird flu hospitalizes one worker, sparking concerns across MissouriSkip to main content HomeU.S.SportsEntertainmentLifeMoneyTechTravelOpinionFor SubscribersWeatherInvestigationsCrosswordsHumankindNewslettersMediaFor YouContributor Content Health workers in Missouri tested after person hospitalized for bird fluEduardo Cuevas USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption Bird flu's 'low risk' to public, experts say. Here's how to avoid it.Despite a number of farm workers catching bird flu across the U.S., experts say there's low risk to the general public with a few exceptions.Health officials are investigating whether a person in Missouri who was hospitalized with bird flu in early September might have infected a handful of others.Testing is ongoing among five health care workers and a household member exposed to the infected person who all came down with mild respiratory symptoms. A cluster of infections would mark a significant expansion of the avian influenza virus, indicating that it could transmit from person to person.On Friday, Missouri and federal health officials stressed there is no current evidence of human-to-human transmission. The immediate risk to the general public is still low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he sees no cause for concern unless or until any of those tests comes back positive."At this point we don’t have any evidence that this one case in Missouri has transmitted the virus to anyone," said Osterholm, an epidemiologist. "I’m not saying it couldn’t have happened, but based on what we know so far, we’ve not had ongoing transmission. There’s no crisis."This time of year, Osterholm said, roughly 2% of Americans have respiratory symptoms, which could be H5N1 or COVID-19 or simply a cold. The blood and DNA test results will tell the story, not symptoms."Just because somebody has symptoms of respiratory illness doesn’t tell me anything about 'is it likely or not likely to be flu,'" he said. "At this point, we want to be careful not to become alarmist."So far this year, 14 people across the U.S. have been infected with H5N1 avian influenza. All but the Missouri person was infected after coming into close contact with poultry or dairy cows known to be infected.Officials don't know how that person became infected with H5N1. Their infection was first reported Sept. 6.Earlier this month, federal health officials had first said the person hospitalized was likely an isolated case that didn’t appear to pose additional risk. Soon after, Missouri officials identified that a person in the same household developed “similar symptoms” on the same day as the confirmed case, according to Lisa Cox, communications director for the state Department of Health and Senior Services. But neither person had typical “flu-like symptoms or conjunctivitis,” Cox said in an email, referring to symptoms seen in the prior bird flu cases across the U.S. this year. The timing of the onset suggested common exposure, such as from a wild bird, rather than person-to-person transmission, she added. Another person reported limited contact with the infected patient, but that person reported no symptoms either before or after the visit.On Friday, CDC said state officials identified 18 health care workers who had higher risk exposure. Three of those workers reported reported mild respiratory symptoms. One person tested negative for influenza A, which includes bird flu. The other two weren’t clinically tested because they passed the 10-day follow-up period when those test results could be connected with a previous exposure, Cox said. Their symptoms also weren’t severe enough for them to seek medical testing.Instead, those two health workers have provided blood samples for CDC to test for H5N1 antibodies, which show up at least three weeks after symptoms have passed.Blood samples have been collected from five health care workers, Cox said. The original person and their household contact have already had their samples sent to the CDC. The five workers’ samples are set to be sent to CDC’s laboratory in Atlanta for testing. However, the remnants of Hurricane Helene passing through the American South are delaying shipment of the specimens, Cox said.“This type of testing is an additional diagnostic test that H5 infection has occurred in the person,” she said. “However, among other limitations, it will not be able to determine either the source or timing of any infection that may have occurred.”Seeing the results of the tests will be crucial, said Dr. Jesse Goodman, an infection diseases specialist at Georgetown University."We don’t know yet if any of these other people do have H5 influenza or did get it − that’s really important to investigate," he said.Goodman added public health workers should be more aggressive about testing people with mild or no symptoms, because it's not clear exactly how H5N1 manifests in people. "It needs to be pursued aggressively," he said.He also said there should be more widespread testing for H5N1, because he expects more people likely have it than have been discovered. The case in Missouri was caught purely by chance, because the person's flu was tested, which doesn't always happen. When it came back as an unusual type, it was sent for further testing, which also is atypical, Goodman said."We can’t view this with panic, but we need to view this as a warning shot and we need to lean forward with our surveillance and our preparedness," he said. "Most public health threats, people overblow them. This one I feel like has been a little underplayed."Karen Weintraub contributed to this report.(This story was updated to add new information.)

By Morgan Oliveira, 2024 Hoard’s Dairyman Editorial Intern Being sick is the worst. With the combination of feeling awful and not being able to perform daily tasks as normal, being sick is something most people dread and will try to avoid at all costs.Arguably enough, the one thing worse than being sick is watching someone else be sick, considering that there’s not much you’re able to do for them in that given moment. Many parents may share this notion, and it’s safe to say that this indescribable feeling is felt by farmers when their herd gets sick. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus has been present in dairy cattle throughout mainly the Midwest and Southern regions of the United States since March. Many dairy farmers have grown conscious of the people and animals let on and off their farm and have since implemented biosecurity practices in an effort to prevent any potential disease spread and outbreaks. I had heard little pieces here and there about the HPAI virus, but I was able to fully understand the severity and extent of the disease when I moved out to the Midwest this summer. Not being entirely familiar with the disease at the time, I found it heartbreaking to hear about the struggles that dairy farmers and their families were facing. It was a relief as farms began to recover.When I left for the summer in mid-June, HPAI hadn’t been confirmed within the California dairy industry and was mainly heard about through whispers or conversations about other regions of the nation. Shortly after I arrived back home this summer, the HPAI virus made its way to California. My newly understood information coupled with the fear of my family’s dairy being affected led me and several dairy farmers in the state to grow wary of the virus and its associated impacts.USDA has confirmed there to be 34 dairies in California to be affected by the HPAI virus so far. All impacted dairies have been quarantined, and unaffected farms are exploring biosecurity options and measures to prevent the virus from becoming widespread throughout the state. Several fall shows, fairs, and dairy cattle events are being canceled in the effort to protect the dairy industry and its farmers. Only time will tell what’s in store for California’s dairy industry, but dairy farmers are determined to protect their herds, communities, and livelihoods from the impact of HPAI.

Talk to the Veterans Crisis Line now Be prepared for flu season and get vaccinated at a VAWNYHS shot clinic The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine every season with rare exceptions. By Mark Richardson, Public Affairs Officer September 24, 2024 Fall is here and now is time to prepare for flu season by getting an influenza vaccine. All VA Western New York Healthcare System (VAWNYHS) patients will be offered the flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine during all face-to-face clinic appointments. In addition, VAWNYHS is holding walk-in flu clinics for Veterans at all service locations including drive-through clinics in Buffalo and Batavia.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine every season with rare exceptions. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of serious complications from influenza. The CDC recommends to stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines.Flu vaccination has important benefits. It can reduce flu illnesses, visits to doctor’s offices, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as make symptoms less severe and reduce flu-related hospitalizations and deaths in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.Flu shot clinicsBuffalo VA Walk in clinic3495 Bailey Ave.Buffalo, NY 14215Freedom Hall/301 Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. 3:30 p.m. through Nov. 1.Buffalo VA Drive-thru clinic3495 Bailey Ave.Buffalo, NY 14215Saturday Sept. 28Saturday, Oct. 19Saturday, Nov. 168:30 a.m. NoonBatavia VA Medical Center Walk in clinic222 Richmond Ave.Batavia, NY 14020-1227Thursdays and Fridays from 8:00 a.m. - 3 p.m.Batavia VA Medical Center Drive-thru clinic222 Richmond Ave.Batavia, NY 14020Thursday, Oct. 10 from 4 p.m. – 6:30 p.m.Dunkirk VA Clinic1170 Central Ave.Dunkirk, NY 14048Wednesdays and Thursdays from 1 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.Jamestown VA Clinic321 Hazeltine Ave.Jamestown, NY 14701Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays from 1 p.m. - 3:30 p.m.Lockport VA Clinic5725 S Transit RoadLockport, NY 14094Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2 p.m. - 4 p.m.Niagara Falls VA Clinic1300 Pine Ave.Niagara Falls, NY 14301Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8 a.m. - NoonOlean VA Clinic465 N Union St.Olean, NY 14760Fridays from 1 p.m. - 3 p.m.Springville VA Clinic231 S Cascade Dr.Springville, NY 14141Fridays from 11 a.m. - 2 p.m.West Seneca VA Clinic968 Union RoadBuffalo, NY 14224Fridays from 11 a.m. - 2 p.m.After Nov. 1, flu vaccines in addition to COVID and other vaccines will be offered via a Walk-In Vaccine Clinic located at 1E on the main floor at the Buffalo Location FeedbackQuick takes: More H5N1 in California cows, CDC public health awards, yellow fever in the Americas | CIDRAP Skip to main content University of Minnesota Main navigationMain content University of Minnesotahttp:/win-cities.umn.edu/612-625-5000 Go to the U of M home page Main navigation News Antimicrobial Resistance COVID-19 Chronic Wasting Disease Influenza Mpox All Topics A-Z Resilient Drug Supply Influenza Vaccines Roadmap CIDRAP Leadership Forum Roadmap Development Coronavirus Vaccines Roadmap . .

California's latest confirmations raise the state's total to 40 affected herds. The outbreaks are centered in the Central Valley. California is the nation's largest milk producer.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today announced more than $176 million in awards to support 48 public health partners, a step to strengthen the nation's public health system. In a statement, the CDC said the funding is part of the National Partners Cooperative Agreement and represents support for the first year of a 5-year cycle. The CDC said the awards boost the ability of the public health workforce to deliver essential services and improve organizational and systems capacity and capability, steps that address health priorities and bolster the US public health infrastructure.Five countries in the Americas region have confirmed 38 yellow fever cases this year, 19 of them fatal, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said in its latest epidemiologic update. Since the agency's last update in July, 5 cases and 2 deaths were added. Countries reporting cases are Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, and Peru. The hardest-hit country is Peru, where 18 cases and 9 deaths have been confirmed. COVID vaccine protects against symptoms 6 weeks after infection, study shows News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 Godji10 / iStock US healthcare workers receiving additional vaccine doses during the Omicron period (December 2021 to April 2022) had a 45% lower risk of having symptoms 6 weeks after COVID-19 infection, according to a study today in Open Forum Infectious Diseases. The study results came from self-reported symptom questionnaires completed 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms, and was a sub-analysis of data collected during the Preventing Emerging Infections through Vaccine Effectiveness Testing Project (Project PREVENT).In total, the researchers enrolled 2,478 participants, of whom 1,422 (57%) had COVID-19. All participants were fully vaccinated with two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and 66.3% had received a third, booster dose. All participants reported COVID-19–like symptoms within 14 days of a qualifying test. The prevalence of symptoms at 6 weeks was 26% (373) in those with COVID-19 and 18% (195) in those without COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2–positive participants had either fever or cough as an initial symptom in 71.9% of cases.Lower odds of symptoms with recent booster Among participants who had COVID-19, those who had received an additional COVID-19 vaccine dose had a lower prevalence of any symptoms than those who had not at 6 weeks post-infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.70). If the third vaccine dose was administered 16 weeks or less before infection, healthcare providers had lower odds of reporting respiratory symptoms (aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.99), psychiatric symptoms (aOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.99), or any symptom (aOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.87) than those who received the dose more than 16 weeks earlier. COVID-19 vaccination might lead to fewer 6-week symptoms among persons with symptomatic infection because of its effect in attenuating the severity of acute illness."COVID-19 vaccination might lead to fewer 6-week symptoms among persons with symptomatic infection because of its effect in attenuating the severity of acute illness," the authors concluded. Study finds little genetic similarity in multidrug-resistant bacteria from pets and their owners News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship shironosov / iStock A study conducted in Germany suggests the interaction between people and their pets is not a major factor in the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), researchers reported last week in Antimicrobial Resistance & Infection Control.For the study, researchers at Charite University Hospital in Berlin performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) on 252 human, 53 dog, and 10 cat isolates collected from a larger case-control study that examined MDRO risk factors among MDRO-positive and MDRO-negative patients. The analysis focused on pet owners and their pets. While several studies in recent years have reported the identification of genetically similar MDROs in people and pets living in the same household using WGS, the study authors say cgMLST, which offers greater discriminatory power and more precise strain typing, has rarely been used.A total of 154 human isolates (24.6% of the 626 pet owners in the larger study) and 62 pet isolates (11.9% of the 514 pets in the larger study) tested positive for MDROs. Of the bacterial species detected in the isolates, five MDROs that were present in people and at least one pet species (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE], and multidrug-resistant [MDR] Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae) were selected for comparison to identify potential transmission. Pets may act as a spillover hostMost of the analyzed isolates showed high genetic diversity, with only minor overlaps between people and pets. Only two human-pet pairs were colonized with MDROs (VRE and MDR E coli), which showed no genetic difference, a finding the study authors say could indicate transmission or acquisition from a common source. In addition, significantly more pet owners than pets were MDRO-positive."This suggests that the interaction between humans and their pets appears to play a minor role in the spread of the MDROs," the authors wrote. "Pets might act as spillover hosts rather than reservoirs for MDROs with transmission potential to humans. Yet, the possibility of transmission from a shared source remains."They add that future studies should include other possible transmission routes and common sources of resistant strains.

Staying up to date with immunizations helps protect you from severe illness. September and October are good times to get vaccinated, but you can still get vaccinated later in the year if you haven’t received your vaccines. Summary What CDC knows Flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) spread more commonly during fall and winter months. Staying up to date with your recommended vaccines reduces the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. What CDC is doing CDC recommends flu and COVID-19 vaccination for everyone ages 6 months and older (and RSV immunization for certain groups). Earlier this year, CDC updated its respiratory virus guidance to provide practical recommendations to help people lower their risk from flu, COVID-19, and RSV. Make a plan to get your recommended vaccines Flu, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause most hospitalizations due to respiratory illness during fall and winter. With fall arriving, it's time to plan to get your recommended vaccines. Staying up to date with vaccines against flu and COVID-19 (and RSV immunization, if recommended for you) protects you from severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Here we answer commonly asked questions about flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines. Why get vaccinated this fall and winter season? Flu, COVID-19, and RSV still have the potential to take a heavy toll across the United States. During a six-month period last fall and winter, these infections caused over 800,000 hospitalizations. Vaccination helps reduce the risk of serious illness and death. While you may still get sick if you are vaccinated, you are less likely to be hospitalized or die from these respiratory illnesses. Often, people hospitalized due to these illnesses have not been vaccinated. How do I know if I'm at higher risk of serious illness? Adults 65 years and older, young children, residents of long-term care facilities, pregnant people, and people with certain long-term health conditions are at increased risk of serious illness from respiratory viruses. Some racial and ethnic groups, like Black and Hispanic people, may be at increased risk for severe outcomes from respiratory viruses due to health disparities. This is due to social determinants of health or the environments where these groups may live, learn, work, and play. Additionally, research suggests some American Indian and Alaska Native infants and young children are at a high risk of severe RSV disease. Which vaccines for respiratory illnesses are recommended for me? CDC recommends the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older. This includes people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine before and people who have had COVID-19. It is especially important for the following groups to get the 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine: People ages 65 years and older People with underlying medical conditions, including immunocompromise People living in long-term care facilities People who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or might become pregnant in the future to protect themselves and their infants An annual flu vaccine, which protects against the three influenza viruses expected to spread this season, is recommended for everyone 6 months and older. If you are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications, flu vaccination is especially important. By getting a flu vaccine you reduce your risk of getting sick with flu, being hospitalized or dying from flu. A flu shot during pregnancy can also protect both a pregnant person and baby for about 6 months after birth. And people with a history of heart disease who got the flu shot are less likely to have a serious cardiac outcome than those who haven't gotten a flu shot. The recommendations for RSV are a bit different since immunization is only recommended for the very young and older adults, which are the populations most likely to develop severe RSV. CDC recommends protecting babies younger than 8 months against severe RSV in one of two ways: through vaccination of a pregnant person (with Pfizer's Abrysvo) at weeks 32-36 of pregnancy or by the baby getting the antibody nirsevimab at birth or just before the RSV season. Nirsevimab is also recommended for some younger children between ages 8 and 19 months who are at increased risk for RSV disease. CDC recommends a single dose of the RSV vaccine for all adults ages 75 and older and for adults ages 60 to 74 who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease. If you received an RSV vaccine last year, you do not need another vaccine. View Larger Which vaccines do you need this fall and winter season? View this Fall and Winter Virus Season Immunization Guide to ensure you know which vaccines are recommended for you. Why get an updated COVID-19 vaccine? Vaccine protection and immunity from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, decreases over time. COVID-19 vaccines are updated to give you protection against the currently circulating viruses. The virus that causes COVID-19 is constantly evolving, with new variants appearing all the time. The 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccines are updated to better protect against currently circulating variants. Are the vaccines available right now? Flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines are available now. The RSV immunization for infants, called nirsevimab, will become available starting October 1. Availability of these immunizations will continue to increase in the coming weeks. When is the best time to get my vaccines? Respiratory virus season often starts in October and peaks between December and March. Getting your updated vaccines in the fall can help provide protection through the fall and winter seasons. Still, respiratory viruses can make people sick any time of the year, so you can get your updated 2024-2025 vaccine at any time if you haven't received it yet. Where can I get my vaccines? There are a few ways you can get your recommended vaccines. Ask your healthcare provider, pharmacist, or visit their website. Contact public health clinics, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), and Rural Health Clinics (RHC). Vaccines.gov can help you find a pharmacy near you that has the flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines. How can I get COVID-19 vaccines at no cost to me? If you have health insurance, you can get the updated COVID-19 vaccine at little or no cost to you. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, people with Medicare drug coverage pay nothing out-of-pocket for adult vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Additionally, most adults enrolled in Medicaid will be guaranteed coverage of ACIP-recommended vaccines at no cost to them. Eligible children 18 years and younger can get free vaccines through Vaccines for Children. The eligibility requirements for this program are listed here. For this season, immunization programs in each jurisdiction received additional funds to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for under- and uninsured adults. Contact your state or local health department to find out more about getting a free vaccine. Can I get all my recommended vaccines during the same visit? Flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines may be given at the same visit. This means that if you're only able to make one trip to get your fall and winter vaccines, you can get all those vaccines recommended for you at once. If you prefer to receive each vaccine at a separate visit, there is no minimum waiting period between vaccines. You should get vaccinated as quickly as possible to make sure you are up to date and protected from severe illness this season. You might also be due for other vaccines, like those to prevent pneumococcal disease, shingles, or whooping cough. While there are some exceptions, most vaccines can be given at the same visit. Talk with a healthcare provider or pharmacist if you have questions about these vaccines. What else can I do to protect myself this respiratory virus season? Staying home when sick, practicing good hygiene, and taking steps for cleaner air are some actions you can do to protect yourself this fall and winter. Additional strategies include masking, maintaining physical distance, and testing. Check out the CDC's updated respiratory virus guidance.

Infectious Diseases: Epidemiology and Prevention Volume 12 - 2024 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1432445 Evaluating hand hygiene knowledge, attitudes, and practices among healthcare workers in post-pandemic H1N1 influenza control: a cross-sectional study from China Qin HongYuling Xu* Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Central Hospital of Enshi Prefecture Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Enshi, China Background: This study evaluates the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of hand hygiene among healthcare workers, crucial for preventing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in medical facilities. Methodology: This cross-sectional study assessed hand hygiene KAP among healthcare workers across various settings in Hubei, China utilizing a stratified random sampling approach from, December 25, 2023-to-April 25, 2024. A bilingual electronic survey, adapted from validated tools, was disseminated via email and social media to ensure a broad reach. Participants included diverse healthcare professionals who met specific inclusion criteria. Responses were analyzed using R software, employing descriptive and inferential statistics to identify key predictors of hand hygiene behavior and to confirm the reliability of the survey instrument. Results: The survey of 2,265 healthcare workers revealed that 77% demonstrated comprehensive knowledge of hand hygiene, 80% exhibited positive attitudes, and 94% practiced effective hand hygiene. Notable findings include a significant understanding of hand hygiene’s role in preventing respiratory illnesses (58%) and HAIs (41% agreed, 39% unsure). High compliance in practices like washing hands for at least 20 s was evident (84%), though gaps in confidence about hand hygiene techniques were noted (33% confident, 56% unsure). Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that younger healthcare workers (21–30 years) were more likely to exhibit both knowledge (OR = 7.4, 95% CI = 1.44–136, p = 0.059) and positive attitudes (OR = 4.48, 95% CI = 1.73–11.8, p < 0.001) compared to other age groups. Significant associations were found between higher income levels and positive attitudes toward hand hygiene (OR for ≥80,000 = 3.19, 95% CI = 2.05–5.02, p < 0.001), and between knowledge and practices, suggesting that well-informed individuals are more likely to adhere to recommended practices. Conclusion: The findings reveal robust hand hygiene knowledge but uncover critical confidence gaps among healthcare workers, urging immediate, targeted educational interventions to fortify adherence and prevent infection outbreaks. 1 Introduction Influenza is a major global health concern due to its rapid mutation and the ability to cause widespread seasonal epidemics (1, 2). Annually, influenza affects 5–15% of the global population, resulting in 290,000 to 650,000 deaths, which surpasses fatalities from all other vaccine-preventable diseases combined (3, 4). The virus can be transmitted by infected individuals up to 24 h before symptom onset. Hospitalized patients, often with compromised health, are at increased risk of infection, which can lead to significant hospital outbreaks and even facility closures due to its short incubation period, mutation propensity, and efficient aerosol transmission (5, 6). In Honduras, the impact of influenza is particularly pronounced, with notable rates of mortality, hospitalization, and incidence in 2017. Influenza, along with pneumonia, represents a significant cause of mortality, accounting for 3.7% of all deaths in the country (4, 7, 8). Seasonal influenza vaccination remains the most effective method to prevent the virus and its severe outcomes. Global health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, recommend annual vaccination for healthcare workers (5, 8). This prioritization aims to shield them from the virus, prevent its spread to vulnerable populations, and maintain healthcare operations during outbreaks (9, 10). Vaccine effectiveness ranges from 40 to 60% in years when the vaccine aligns well with circulating strains, with antibody protection lasting up to 6–8 months (6, 11, 12). Hand hygiene is a pivotal intervention in the control of influenza virus transmission. The WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) underscore the importance of effective hand hygiene practices to mitigate the spread of infectious agents (12–14). The relevance of these practices intensifies during the influenza season when the incidence of viral infections escalates considerably. Understanding the community’s knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding hand hygiene during the influenza season is crucial for developing targeted public health interventions. This introduction delineates the foundational aspects of the KAP framework, contextualizes it within the scope of influenza prevention, and elucidates the interdependencies of these elements in fostering effective hand hygiene behaviors. Knowledge about the modes of influenza transmission and the effectiveness of hand hygiene in preventing infection is fundamental to compliance with recommended practices. Previous studies have demonstrated that an elevated level of awareness correlates positively with adherence to hand hygiene guidelines (15). However, gaps in public knowledge often persist, particularly in distinguishing the specifics of hand hygiene, such as the appropriate technique and duration of handwashing or the use of hand sanitizers (16, 17). Attitudes toward hand hygiene practices during the influenza season significantly influence behavior patterns. A positive attitude toward hand hygiene, including the belief in its effectiveness and the perceived severity of contracting influenza, often predicts a higher commitment to regular handwashing (18, 19). Conversely, misconceptions or underestimation of the influenza virus’s impact can lead to complacency and inadequate hand hygiene practices. The actual practices of hand hygiene encompass a range of behaviors from handwashing with soap and water to the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (20, 21). The consistency, technique, and context of these practices vary widely among different populations. Observational studies have revealed that even among healthcare professionals, adherence to optimal hand hygiene protocols is not universally consistent (22–24). The interaction between KAP is complex and dynamic. Enhanced knowledge can lead to more favorable attitudes, which in turn can encourage better practices. However, this linear progression is not always observed, as social, cultural, and individual factors May also play significant roles (24). For instance, even with high knowledge and positive attitudes, practical barriers such as lack of access to handwashing facilities can impede the adoption of recommended practices (8, 14). Therefore, current research examined the KAP of healthcare professionals concerning hand hygiene to prevent influenza, highlighting the importance of consistent and proper hand hygiene measures during the influenza season. Insight into these factors is critical for developing public health strategies that improve adherence to hand hygiene protocols, thereby decreasing both the spread and severity of influenza. 2 Methodology 2.1 Study design The current investigation adopted a cross-sectional study designed based on previous studies (10, 14, 25–27) to evaluate the understanding, attitudes, and practices concerning hand hygiene among healthcare workers in various medical settings across Hubei, China from December 25, 2023-to-April 25, 2024. A comprehensive electronic survey, developed based on established instruments, was disseminated through email links and social media platforms to contacts in various hospital staff, who then facilitated its distribution among potential participants. The study utilized a stratified random sampling method to ensure diverse representation among healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and support staff across multiple regions. The survey was made available in both Mandarin and English to cater to the linguistic preferences of the respondents. It included detailed questions on demographic characteristics, knowledge of hand hygiene protocols, attitudes toward hand sanitation, and reported hand hygiene behaviors. 2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Participants included healthcare workers—doctors, nurses, and auxiliary staff—actively employed in ICU settings who provided informed consent and were proficient in either Mandarin or English. The inclusion criteria were broad to capture a diverse range of insights, while exclusion criteria limited participation to non-healthcare personnel, individuals under the age of 18, and those who submitted incomplete responses. 2.3 Measurement of attributes The knowledge domain consisted of 16 questions that evaluated the respondents’ understanding of key aspects of hand hygiene, such as the effectiveness of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, the relationship between improper hand hygiene and healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), and the impact of hand hygiene on the spread of respiratory illnesses. Each question was designed to measure the awareness and comprehension levels of the respondents, with options “Yes,” “No,” and “Not Sure.” Correct responses were awarded one point each, allowing for a maximum score of 16. A threshold of 50% (8 points) was set to differentiate between adequate and inadequate knowledge levels. The attitude domain comprised 12 items aimed at gaging the personal beliefs and perceived importance of hand hygiene among the participants. This section probed respondents’ confidence in their hand hygiene knowledge, their views on the necessity of strict compliance with hand hygiene protocols, and their opinion on the adequacy of current hand hygiene policies. Responses were categorized as “Yes,” “No,” or “Not Sure,” with a scoring system where “Yes” indicated a positive attitude (one point per positive response). A cumulative score of 6 or more was used to distinguish between positive and negative attitudes toward hand hygiene. The practices section of the survey included six questions focused on actual hand hygiene behaviors, such as adherence to handwashing protocols between patient contacts, participation in hand hygiene training, and usage of hand sanitizers when soap and water are not available. This segment aimed to assess the practical implementation of hand hygiene practices, with “Yes,” “No,” and “Not Sure” responses. Each “Yes” response, indicating compliance with best practices, earned one point. A cutoff of three points was employed to classify respondents into “good” or “poor” practice categories. 2.4 Statistical analysis and quality control To ensure the reliability and validity of the survey instrument, we undertook a comprehensive, multi-step validation process. This process began with the adaptation of items from previously validated tools, carefully tailored to address the specific context of post-pandemic hand hygiene practices in healthcare settings. Content validity was rigorously assessed by a panel of infection control experts, who meticulously evaluated the relevance and clarity of each item. Following this, a pilot test involving 50 healthcare workers was conducted to identify and rectify any ambiguities or comprehension issues. The internal consistency of the survey was confirmed by calculating Cronbach’s alpha, which yielded a coefficient of 0.85, indicating a high level of reliability. To further ensure the survey’s robustness, construct validity was examined through exploratory factor analysis, which validated the survey’s ability to accurately measure the intended constructs. Once the survey data was collected, it was compiled in an Excel database and subsequently analyzed using R software (version 4.3.3), selected for its advanced data management and analytical capabilities. The preliminary data analysis involved meticulous cleaning and validation using functions from the dplyr and tidyr packages, ensuring the integrity of the dataset. Descriptive statistics provided an essential foundation for understanding the data distribution. To identify significant associations and predictors of hand hygiene practices, we employed bivariate and multivariate analyses. Specifically, Fisher’s exact test and Pearson’s Chi-squared test were used to assess relationships between categorical variables, while logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the influence of various factors on hand hygiene behaviors. The results were presented in terms of odds ratios and confidence intervals, emphasizing both the statistical significance and the practical implications of our findings. 3 Results The survey involved 2,265 healthcare workers, focusing on their hand hygiene KAP, alongside detailed demographic data. Predominantly younger, 55% of participants were aged 21–30, with 30% between 51 and 60 years, showing a skewed age distribution. The demographic profile was chiefly female (66%) and single (57%). A notable 69% of respondents came from family units of four or more. Employment was predominantly hospital-based (69%), with considerable segments in private practice and clinics. About 58% preferred not to disclose their income, indicating privacy concerns. Employment data showed 50% as permanent employees and 45% on contracts, suggesting diverse job security. The distribution of roles within healthcare revealed 51% technicians and 21% nurses, important for assessing hand hygiene compliance. Notably, 77% demonstrated sound hand hygiene knowledge, 80% held positive attitudes, and 94% practiced good hand hygiene. These statistics underscore the robust awareness and execution of hand hygiene, critical for infection control, and inform targeted interventions to enhance hand hygiene practices among healthcare workers, as shown in Table 1. Table 1 Table 1. Demographic variables of study participants. 3.1 Knowledge assessment Responses from healthcare workers regarding their knowledge and practices of hand hygiene, structured into “No,” “Not Sure,” and “Yes” options, showed that 62% recognized alcohol-based hand sanitizers as a viable alternative when soap and water were unavailable. However, opinions were split on whether improper hygiene leads to HAIs —41% agreed, while 39% were unsure, highlighting a need for further education. Similarly, 58% acknowledged hand hygiene’s role in curbing the spread of non-influenza respiratory illnesses, though 36% remained uncertain. A significant 66% understood the importance of hand hygiene even with clean-looking hands. High compliance (73%) was seen in washing hands after touching pets or seemingly clean patient-care equipment, and 59% adhered to using sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol. Notably, the practice of washing hands for a minimum of 20 s to effectively remove germs was strongly supported by 84% of participants, underscoring a crucial, widely accepted preventive measure. This data collectively pointed to a solid foundation of good hygiene practices among healthcare workers, albeit interspersed with areas where clarity and reinforcement were needed, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Figure 1. Distribution of hand hygiene knowledge levels among healthcare workers, highlighting knowledge gaps. 3.2 Attitude assessment Responses from healthcare workers about their attitudes toward hand hygiene were segmented into “No,” “Not Sure,” and “Yes” answers, showed a mixed response regarding confidence in knowing proper hand hygiene techniques—33% were confident, yet 56% remained unsure, suggesting a gap in knowledge or confidence. The majority viewed hand hygiene as vital for safety (69%) and believed in stricter enforcement of protocols (79%), indicating a strong consensus on its importance for preventing infections. About 74% found regular reminders helpful, supporting ongoing educational efforts. While 69% felt motivated to maintain rigorous hand hygiene, only 58% felt supported by management in adhering to these standards, pointing to potential areas for improvement in workplace support systems. A robust 70% agreed that hand hygiene responsibility was shared among all workplace members, and 77% recognized the role of patient education in hand hygiene as crucial. Despite strong adherence to guidelines, only 67% believed their workplace provided sufficient resources for proper hand hygiene, and 68% agreed that the guidelines were clear and easy to follow. There was a significant belief (71%) in the adequacy of current policies to prevent influenza, yet a substantial 62% saw a need for more training sessions, indicating a desire for enhanced education and resources to better implement hand hygiene practices effectively, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 Figure 2. Distribution of attitude of healthcare workers toward hand hygiene, highlighting knowledge gaps. 3.3 Practice assessment Healthcare workers’ responses regarding their practical engagement in hand hygiene measures, were delineated into “No,” “Not Sure,” and “Yes” categories. An overwhelming 93% advocated for hand hygiene among colleagues and patients, highlighting a strong commitment to promoting hygiene practices. About 55% managed to avoid touching their face or personal items during clinical shifts, though 32% still engaged in these potentially contaminating behaviors. In terms of procedural hygiene, 63% consistently changed gloves and washed hands between different patient contacts, but 28% did not, indicating room for improvement. A high participation rate in annual influenza vaccination programs stood at 82%, reflecting a proactive stance toward infection prevention. However, participation in regular hand hygiene audits was less frequent, with only 42% engaging regularly and 49% not participating, suggesting a need for more consistent and mandatory audits within healthcare facilities. The use of hand sanitizer as an alternative when soap and water were not available was affirmed by 79%, underlining its acceptance as a vital hygiene tool, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 Figure 3. Distribution of hand hygiene practice among healthcare workers, highlighting knowledge gaps. 3.4 Binary logistic regression analysis 3.4.1 Knowledge The statistical analysis of hand hygiene knowledge across various demographic and professional variables among 2,265. The findings indicated that knowledge varied across age groups, with younger adults aged 21–30 demonstrating an odds ratio (OR) of 7.4 (95% CI = 1.44, 136, p-value = 0.059), suggesting a stronger likelihood of being knowledgeable. In contrast, older adults aged 51–60 showed less influence on knowledge levels with an OR of 8.42 (95% CI = 1.61, 155, p-value = 0.058). Gender appeared to moderately influence knowledge, with males showing a slightly lower likelihood of being knowledgeable compared to females (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.84, 1.29, p-value = 0.7). Marital status revealed significant discrepancies; single individuals were less likely to be knowledgeable than married ones, with an OR of 2.16 (95% CI = 0.87, 6.22, p-value <0.001). Family size impacted knowledge, especially in larger households, where the knowledge level was lower (OR for ≥4 members = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.42, 1.12, p-value = 0.009). Income levels showed a strong association; individuals earning more than 80,000 were less likely to be knowledgeable (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.44, 0.92, p-value <0.001). Employment status correlated with knowledge; permanent employees were more likely to be knowledgeable than contract workers (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.46, 0.76, p-value <0.001). The role within the healthcare setting did not significantly affect knowledge, as seen in the similar odds ratios across various roles. However, attitude toward hand hygiene showed a strong link with knowledge levels; those with a positive attitude were significantly more likely to be knowledgeable (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.30, p-value <0.001). Practice correlated positively with knowledge, with good practices associated with higher knowledge levels (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.81, 1.85, p-value = 0.3), as shown in Table 2. Table 2 Table 2. Binary logistic regression analysis for knowledge assessment. 3.4.2 Attitude Attitude showed distinct variations across different demographic and professional backgrounds. Age had a considerable impact on attitudes toward hand hygiene, with significant differences observed. Younger healthcare workers aged 21–30 demonstrated a strong inclination toward positive attitudes, as evidenced by an odds ratio (OR) of 4.48 (95% CI = 1.73, 11.8, p-value <0.001). Similarly, middle-aged workers (31–40 years) tended positive attitudes with an OR of 7.19 (95% CI = 2.66, 19.7, p-value <0.001). Gender differences were relatively marginal but notable; males were slightly less likely to hold positive attitudes compared to females, with an OR of 0.84 (95% CI = 0.66, 1.05, p-value = 0.13). Marital status did not show a substantial divergence in attitude, with single individuals marginally more likely to have positive attitudes compared to married ones (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 1.06, 5.80, p-value = 0.1). Household size correlated with attitude, where individuals from larger households (≥4 members) were more likely to have a positive attitude (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.16, 3.14, p-value = 0.012). The types of institutions did not significantly impact attitudes, indicating uniformity of perspectives across different work settings. Income levels were a strong predictor of attitudes toward hand hygiene; those earning less than 50,000 exhibited fewer positive attitudes compared to higher earners (OR for ≥80,000 = 3.19, 95% CI = 2.05, 5.02, p-value <0.001). Employment status showed no significant effects on attitudes, suggesting that job security or contract terms did not markedly influence these views. In the healthcare setting, roles did not significantly influence attitudes, indicating that whether one is a nurse, physician, or technician did not drastically change their perspective on hand hygiene. However, knowledge strongly correlated with attitudes; more knowledgeable individuals were significantly more likely to hold positive attitudes (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.30, p-value <0.001), as shown in Table 3. Table 3 Table 3. Binary logistic regression analysis for attitude assessment. 3.4.3 Practice The practice suggested diverse influences across different factors. Among, age demonstrated no significant influence on practice habits, as indicated by the high odds ratios with indeterminate confidence intervals (CIs), suggesting inconsistent effects across different age groups. For example, participants aged 21–30 and 31–40 showed extremely high odds ratios (ORs of 3,416,725 and 3,601,871 respectively), but these figures likely indicated data anomalies or calculation errors due to small sample sizes in certain age brackets. Gender seemed to have a negligible effect on hygiene practices, with males and females exhibiting similar probabilities of adhering to good practices (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.65, 1.36, p-value = 0.8). Marital status also showed minimal impact, although married participants showed a slightly higher inclination toward better practices (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 0.95, 5.10, p-value = 0.071). Family size and the type of institution worked in did not significantly affect hand hygiene practices, with similar adherence rates across groups with different family sizes and those working in clinics, hospitals, or private practices. Household income showed some variation, with those earning between 51,000–80,000 showing a moderate increase in good practice adherence (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.09, 4.52, p-value = 0.2), as shown in Table 4. Table 4 Table 4. Binary logistic regression analysis for practice assessment. 4 Discussion The responses from 2,265 healthcare workers provided critical insights into their hand hygiene practices, attitudes, and knowledge, along with detailed demographic information. The cohort was predominantly younger, with 55% aged between 21 and 30 years and 30% aged between 51 and 60 years, representing a diverse age range. A significant majority of participants were female (66%) and single (57%), with 69% coming from family units of four or more. Most were employed in hospitals (69%), while 58% preferred not to disclose their income. The study revealed that 77% of participants demonstrated comprehensive hand hygiene knowledge, 80% held positive attitudes toward hand hygiene, and 94% adhered to good practices. These findings highlight the strong foundation of hand hygiene awareness and compliance among healthcare workers, which is crucial for effective infection control and informs the development of targeted interventions to further enhance these practices (28, 29). The need for ongoing education is crucial, as knowledge directly impacts adherence to hand hygiene protocols, which can decrease HAIs by 30 to 50%. In contrast, a study in Lahore revealed lower knowledge and practice scores among healthcare personnel, particularly nurses, compared to the high compliance observed in the current study (30). This discrepancy might be attributed to demographic differences and variations in institutional training programs. The higher compliance in the current study May be due to the structured educational efforts and monitoring, which were less evident in the Lahore study. Moreover, a qualitative assessment in Guinea emphasized the impact of the Ebola outbreak on improving hand hygiene practices temporarily, suggesting that sustained improvements require long-term commitment and regular training (31). This study reinforces the notion that fear-driven compliance is temporary, underscoring the need for continuous education and motivation beyond immediate health crises. The current study reveals mixed responses regarding attitudes toward hand hygiene, with a significant proportion of healthcare workers unsure about proper hand hygiene techniques despite understanding their importance for safety. This reflects findings in a study conducted at a Vietnamese university, where despite high awareness, actual compliance with hand hygiene protocols was inconsistent, stressing the need for reinforced training and clearer guidelines (32, 33). The uncertainty expressed by participants in the current study underscores a similar gap in confidence that could be bridged through enhanced educational outreach. Regarding practices, while a strong commitment to promoting hand hygiene was noted, inconsistencies in glove use and hand washing between patient contacts indicate room for improvement. This aligns with the situation described at Faranah Regional Hospital, Guinea, where despite previous improvements during the Ebola crisis, a decline in strict adherence to hand hygiene practices was observed post-crisis (31). This suggests that ongoing motivation and regular audits are crucial to maintaining high standards of hygiene practices. Moreover, the strong support for regular hand hygiene reminders and the acknowledged need for enhanced managerial support and resources in the current study reflect sentiments from research in Lahore, which indicated that better resource allocation and supportive management could foster improved hygiene practices among healthcare workers (30). The desire for more training sessions and clearer guidelines mirrors the global need for continuous improvement in hand hygiene education to effectively combat HAIs (34). The current study indicated that 62% of healthcare workers recognize alcohol-based hand sanitizers as a viable alternative when soap and water are not available. This aligns with the CDC’s recommendation that hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol can be effective in reducing microbes on hands in certain situations (35, 36). However, it is also noted that sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, which May explain why 39% were unsure about the link between improper hygiene and HAIs (37). The uncertainty among 36% of participants about hand hygiene’s role in curbing non-influenza respiratory illnesses contrasts with WHO guidelines, which emphasize hand hygiene as a crucial measure to prevent the spread of infections (38). The 58% acknowledgment rate among healthcare workers could be improved through targeted education, reinforcing the importance of hand hygiene as supported by global health authorities (9, 39, 43). Interestingly, the practice of washing hands for a minimum of 20 s is strongly supported by 84% of participants, which is in line with the CDC’s handwashing guidelines (40). In our study, healthcare workers exhibited a robust knowledge base and positive attitudes toward hand hygiene, with 77% demonstrating strong knowledge and 80% showing positive attitudes. These results can be contrasted with findings where healthcare workers who participated in formal training sessions at their facilities reported higher knowledge and attitude scores toward influenza vaccination. This correlation suggests that structured educational programs are effective in enhancing understanding and shaping positive health behaviors (14, 44). In our study, despite a high level of knowledge across the board, there was no direct correlation between knowledge levels and the actual practice of hand hygiene, which is akin to the observed trend where higher knowledge about influenza did not necessarily predict vaccination rates. Healthcare workers’ engagement in hand hygiene practices demonstrates significant adherence, with variances across specific behaviors and settings. A notable 93% of healthcare workers advocate for hand hygiene among colleagues and patients, emphasizing a strong commitment to these practices (45). However, about 32% of workers still engage in potentially contaminating behaviors like touching their face or personal items during shifts (41). Regarding procedural hygiene, 63% consistently change gloves and wash hands between different patient contacts, but 28% do not follow this protocol, suggesting a need for stricter adherence and regular audits, as only 42% participate in regular hygiene audits (42). The high participation rate in annual influenza vaccination at 82% indicates a proactive approach toward infection prevention. However, the regular use of hand sanitizer, endorsed by 79% of the workers, highlights its acceptance as an essential hygiene tool when soap and water are not available (31). This data underscores the importance of consistent training, availability of hygiene materials, and mandatory hygiene audits to improve overall hand hygiene compliance within healthcare settings. The logistic regression analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing hand hygiene knowledge, attitudes, and practices among healthcare workers. For example, the OR of 4.48 for healthcare workers aged 21–30 years indicates that younger professionals are significantly more likely to hold positive attitudes toward hand hygiene compared to their older counterparts. This suggests that targeted educational interventions could be particularly effective if focused on sustaining and further enhancing these positive attitudes in younger workers. Additionally, the OR of 3.19 for participants with higher income levels (≥80,000) suggests a strong association between socioeconomic status and positive attitudes toward hand hygiene. This finding underscores the need for tailored strategies that consider the economic context of healthcare workers, potentially addressing disparities in resource availability and access to training. Moreover, the OR of 1.24 for good practices associated with higher knowledge levels reinforces the critical role of continuous education in promoting adherence to hand hygiene protocols. These practical implications highlight the importance of not only maintaining but also intensifying training and support mechanisms across various demographic groups to ensure consistent and effective hand hygiene practices. The results provide actionable insights for policymakers and healthcare administrators to design and implement interventions that are both demographically sensitive and contextually appropriate, ultimately aiming to reduce healthcare-associated infections and improve patient outcomes (46). While our study shows strong hand hygiene practices among healthcare workers, several barriers May hinder consistent adherence. Key challenges include limited access to resources like hand sanitizers, especially in lower-income settings, and the perception of hand hygiene as a lower priority amid heavy workloads. Additionally, gaps in confidence regarding proper hand hygiene techniques can lead to inconsistent application. To overcome these barriers, it is essential to ensure consistent access to hygiene supplies and to integrate hand hygiene education into ongoing training programs. Emphasizing the importance of hand hygiene through regular reminders and audits can also help embed these practices into daily routines, making them an integral part of patient care. Addressing these barriers is critical for reducing healthcare-associated infections and improving overall patient outcomes. In addition, this study has a few limitations, the study’s cross-sectional design limits causal inference, and reliance on self-reported data May introduce response bias, potentially skewing results. The dissemination method via email and social media May have excluded some potential participants with limited digital access, affecting sample representativeness. Broad inclusion criteria and linguistic limitations could also introduce selection biases, affecting the diversity and accuracy of the data. Additionally, the use of stratified random sampling does not ensure a sample perfectly reflective of the broader healthcare worker population in Hubei, China, and data integrity issues could impact the reliability of the findings. Notwithstanding, to our knowledge, this is the first KAP study to assess post-pandemic influenza control among healthcare workers in Hubei, China. 5 Conclusion The current study highlights significant insights into the hand hygiene behaviors of healthcare workers, showing a strong foundation in KAP essential for infection control. While the majority of respondents demonstrated good knowledge and compliance with hand hygiene protocols, gaps in confidence and perceptions indicate a need for enhanced educational programs. The results suggest that reinforcing the understanding of hand hygiene’s impact on preventing respiratory illnesses and HAIs could further strengthen practices. Additionally, the data reveals a disparity in the support from management to adhere to hand hygiene standards, highlighting an area for institutional improvement. Regular reminders and comprehensive training sessions could serve to boost both knowledge and the proper implementation of hygiene practices. Addressing these gaps through targeted interventions could significantly enhance the effectiveness of hand hygiene measures, ensuring a safer healthcare environment and reducing the risk of infection transmission.

But the fact that they became ill after caring for this patient raises the specter of person-to-person spread of the virus — a possibility that flu experts say needs further exploration. Testing their blood for antibodies to H5N1 should answer the question.“CDC continues to closely monitor available data from influenza surveillance systems, particularly in affected states, and there has been no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including in Missouri,” the agency said in the update, posted to its website. The CDC continues to characterize the risk posed to the general public by the H5N1 outbreak as “low.”In the more than a quarter century that H5N1 bird flu has been circulating, there have been rare occasions when it was thought that person-to-person spread had probably occurred. But ongoing chains of transmission involving several generations of cases have never been detected. advertisement This marks the third time that Missouri has revealed that it had found health workers who had flu-like illnesses after treating the unnamed H5N1 patient. The infected individual was hospitalized from Aug. 22 to Aug. 25, Lisa Cox, communications director of Missouri’s Department of Health and Senior Services, told STAT via email. To date a total of seven people who were in contact with the confirmed case have been identified as having been ill — a household member and six health care workers. One of the health workers tested negative for influenza when he or she was ill. The fact that the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services is still finding such individuals weeks after the H5N1 patient was released from hospital is raising concerns about the rigor of the investigation that the state is running. The CDC cannot send investigators to a state unless its help is requested, and that hasn’t happened.“Public health credibility is really on the line here,” Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told STAT. Related Story Sequencing wastewater material may be the key to getting a grip on the H5N1 bird flu outbreak Osterholm, who served as Minnesota’s state epidemiologist for 15 years, is troubled by how long it is taking for Missouri to figure out who might have been infected, if indeed there was spread from the original patient.Of the newly identified health care workers, one was exposed to the patient before precautions were put in place to prevent spread of respiratory pathogens, a situation the CDC described as having put this individual at higher risk than the other health care workers who were exposed to the patient. advertisement Blood samples have been collected from the five health workers who were ill after caring for the patient, Cox said, adding they will be sent to CDC’s Atlanta headquarters as soon as safe shipment can be assured, citing the disruption caused by Hurricane Helene. Follow-up interviews with 94 health workers who had contact with the patient after infection control measures were put in place are “nearing completion,” she noted. Earlier it was revealed that a household contact of the individual became ill on the same day as the person who was hospitalized. But that second person was not tested while he or she was ill. The CDC is currently studying a blood sample from the second individual looking for antibodies to H5N1 influenza. It is also analyzing a blood sample from the confirmed case. The Missouri case is one of 14 that have been detected in the U.S. this year, while the country has been in the grips of an H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle that was first recognized in late March. As of Friday, 239 herds in 14 states have tested positive for H5N1, though that is believed to be an underestimate of the true scope of the outbreak. Missouri is not among the states that reported infected dairy herds.Many farmers have refused to test their animals and few states have forced the issue. Exceptions are Colorado, which is doing bulk tank testing on dairy farms, and California, which is doing bulk tank testing of farms that are located close to or have interactions with affected dairies. Since the start of the outbreak, Colorado has found 64 infected herds. California, which declared its first positive herd in late August, has to date confirmed 41 affected farms.

Four more health-care workers say they had respiratory symptoms after they tended to a hospitalized patient in Missouri who tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. CDC/NIAID CNN — Four more health-care workers who tended to a person hospitalized with H5N1 bird flu have revealed that they had respiratory symptoms after their exposures, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One health-care worker who had symptoms had what investigators consider high-risk contact with the patient, meaning they provided care before the hospital advised taking precautions such as wearing a mask when tending to the patient. Three additional workers reportedly had low-risk contact with the patient after the hospital required precautions. Scientists say they are concerned that the bird flu virus infecting dairy cows and poultry flocks in the US will have opportunities to become a more dangerous virus over the fall and winter. David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe/Getty Images Related article The US is entering a riskier season for spread of H5N1 bird flu. Here’s why experts are worried None of these workers was tested at the time they experienced symptoms, the CDC reported Friday. Before Friday’s disclosure, two other health-care workers had been identified as having symptoms after caring for this patient, bringing the total number of workers with symptoms to six. To give an idea of the scope of the investigation, 18 health-care workers have been identified as having high-risk exposure to the patient, and 94 others had contact that was considered low-risk, the CDC said. The six health-care workers who fell ill did not have severe symptoms, and they have since resolved. One worker tested negative for influenza at the time of their illness. The other five will have their blood tested to see whether they have antibodies against the virus, which would show whether they had a past H5N1 infection, the CDC added. It has been three weeks since the CDC and Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services announced that a person who had no contact with animals had tested positive for H5N1, the 14th human infection in the United States since April. The other 13 cases were in farm workers who had direct contact with infected dairy cows and chickens. The cause of the Missouri patient’s infection in still under investigation, which is being led by the state, with assistance from the CDC. None of the people in the US with a confirmed H5N1 infection is known to have infected other people. “The investigation is ongoing and there remains no evidence to suggest person-to-person transmission at this time,” Lisa Cox, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, wrote in an email to CNN. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team. Person-to-person transmission would raise alarm because it would suggest that the virus was changing in ways that could allow it to more easily infect humans. The investigation of the bird flu patient’s household contacts has been completed, Cox said. One person who lives in the same house as the patient developed symptoms the same day. However, the timing doesn’t suggest that one person infected the other but that both had a common exposure. “Neither had typical flu-like symptoms or conjunctivitis,” Cox wrote. Only one other person had “limited” contact with the patient at home, but when questioned, that person said they have not been ill, she said. In other updates, the CDC said that it has developed a test for wastewater that can discriminate samples with H5 viruses from other types of influenza A. This will be particularly helpful as the US moves into flu season and influenza A becomes more common in wastewater. The CDC is reminding people: Not to touch sick or dying animals, including wild and farmed birds and cows. To avoid bedding and litter of animals suspected of having H5N1 influenza. Not to drink raw milk. Heating milk kills the virus, so pasteurized products are safe. to wear personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves when working with sick animals. The agency says the immediate risk to the public from H5N1 bird flu continues to be low.

Share this item with your network: By Veronica Salib, Associate Editor Published: 24 Sep 2024 As influenza season rapidly approaches, the FDA has approved a self-administered nasal spray influenza vaccine: FluMist. With this new approval, the nasal influenza vaccine can be self-administered at home for adults ages 18-49 or by a caregiver for individuals ages 2-17, marking the first influenza vaccine that does not require healthcare provider administration. "Today's approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility, and accessibility for individuals and families," said Peter Marks, MD, Ph.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in the FDA press release. "Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death. This approval adds another option for vaccination against influenza disease and demonstrates the FDA's commitment to advancing public health." FluMist has been approved in the United States since 2003, initially for individuals ages 5 through 49. In 2007, the FDA expanded approval to include individuals as young as 2. The nasal vaccine is a live attenuated influenza vaccine that includes a weakened form of live influenza virus strains administered via a nasal spray. However, this vaccine still must be prescribed. For individuals looking to self-administer the vaccine or administer it as a caregiver, the manufacturer will offer sales through a third-party online pharmacy that will screen and assess eligibility and provide eligible patients with a prescription. Once that's done, the vaccine will be shipped to whatever address they provide with prescribing information, information for patients and their caregivers, and instructions for use. The instructions for use will also include storage, administration and disposal guidance. "For the first time, families and caregivers will be able to protect themselves against influenza with a needle-free, self-administered vaccine from the convenience of their own home. Each year, influenza poses a significant burden for people, society and health systems; additional tools to increase access to vaccinations, while also reducing disparities, are critical," said Ravi Jhaveri, MD, division head of Infectious Disease at AstraZeneca, in the company press release. According to the FDA, influenza infections contribute to up to 41 million illnesses annually in the U.S. Of these illnesses, up to 710,000 result in hospitalization, and as many as 51,000 are fatal. Although influenza is a relatively common infectious respiratory disease that can be mild for many individuals, specific populations are at a greater risk of severe complications, including those with chronic diseases, such as diabetes or asthma. Getting vaccinated for influenza annually is the best way to prevent infection, hospitalization, complications, and fatalities. Once available, the self- or caregiver-administered FluMist will provide another tool for protecting against influenza.

"There's an H1N1, an H3N2 and an influenza B virus that this vaccine will protect against. Compared to last year, the H3N2 component is different. So this protects against a different strain of that virus that we didn't have in last year's flu vaccine," said Dr. Nipunie Rajapakse, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases. "We recommend getting the vaccine before the end of October, since we tend to see cases of influenza increasein November, December and January. And so you want to make sure that you're protected going into that time of increased influenza circulation," she said. She says there are some people who may benefit from getting a flu shot earlier. "So children under 9 years of age, especially if this is their first time getting the flu vaccine or they haven't had two prior doses of the flu vaccine, they actually will need two doses separated by four weeks. And so to get that full protection, it'll take them a bit longer." Also, those who are pregnant and will be delivering early on in the flu season.

When is the optimal time to get the flu shot? Flu season lasts from October to May, and cases in the U.S. peak from December to February. That’s why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people get their flu vaccine by the end of October, since it takes the immune system about two weeks to rev up its maximum response to the vaccine. This means generating sufficient immune cells—including antibodies—against the virus. "The perfect time to get vaccinated against flu is right before cases start to take off," says Dr. Kawsar Talaat, associate professor in international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.Read More: How to Stop Checking Your Phone Every 10 SecondsBut the reality is that pharmacies, clinics, and doctors' offices can't accommodate everyone flooding in at the same time. So if you’re at the pharmacy and there’s no line in September, there’s no reason not to get vaccinated.“We have seen flu circulate as early as October, so it’s not too early to get vaccinated now,” says Talaat. And while protection from the vaccine starts to wane after three to four months, “it doesn’t go down to zero.” Even if your protection starts to fade, you will still be protected.There are some exceptions to that guidance, says Dr. Robert Jacobson, professor of pediatrics at Mayo Clinic. Children under nine years old who are getting vaccinated for flu for the first time need two doses, spaced a month apart. For them, starting in late July or August makes sense, especially if parents want their children to be vaccinated before the start of the school year. Anyone age 65 or older should also consider getting vaccinated in late summer as well, since influenza does start circulating then and older people are at higher risk of developing complications, being hospitalized, or dying from the flu. Finally, pregnant women in their third trimester should also consider getting vaccinated in July or August, so their bodies can pass on protective antibodies to the baby in utero. This protection is important since babies generally don’t get their first flu vaccine until they are about six months old. If they are born during the flu season, the protection they receive from their mothers serves as the strongest defense against influenza in their first few months of life.How effective is the annual flu shot? That depends on the year. Each spring, health experts predict which influenza strains will be circulating and causing disease, giving manufacturers enough time to include them in the vaccines. Generally, says Talaat, if the shot is a good match with circulating strains, then you can expect your shot to protect you from getting flu about half the time. And if you do get infected, you’re more likely to have a milder bout of disease than if you hadn’t been vaccinated. You're also less likely to be hospitalized or die from influenza: risks that especially affect older people. Studies show that being vaccinated against the flu can protect you from other health issues as well, such as heart attacks and strokes. Flu infections can worsen inflammation, which can contribute to heart disease and other conditions.Read More: Do You Need to Take Electrolytes to Stay Hydrated?Even with waning, the vaccine continues to provide good protection, says Jacobson—enough that health officials do not recommend that older people who get vaccinated in late summer, for example, get boosted with another dose later in the season. “We consider them protected for the season,” he says. Plus, people age 65 and older generally receive one of several stronger flu vaccines to generate the most robust immune response; one of them includes four times the amount of immune-activating flu antigens. “They are safe and effective, and for people over 65, they are the way to go,” says Jacobson.Can I get the flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine at the same time? Yes, and you shouldn't hesitate to do so. Talaat has conducted a study showing that people getting both shots did not report any more side effects—such as sore arms, muscle aches, or fevers—than people who got them at different times.And for people wondering if getting the two shots on the same day might somehow yield weaker immune responses to both COVID-19 and influenza, “we have not found any interference with flu and COVID-19 vaccines,” says Jacobson. By not getting the vaccines on the same day, “you aren’t doing your immune system any favors.”Even if you’ve already had the flu, or if it’s later in the season (say January or February), it’s not too late to get vaccinated. There are usually several strains of influenza causing-disease, and the shot would protect you against the strains you haven’t gotten yet. In fact, flu vaccines generate a more wide-ranging immune response against several influenza strains included in the shot than a natural infection would, since the infection is only a single strain of the virus. “This is a good example where natural infection is not as good as vaccination, and certainly not as safe,” says Jacobson. “Our vaccines these days are refined and designed to work with each other, and we have good evidence that they are safe and effective. Get all the vaccines you are due for.”More Must-Reads from TIMEHow Donald Trump WonThe Best Inventions of 2024Why Sleep Is the Key to Living LongerHow to Break 8 Toxic Communication HabitsNicola Coughlan Bet on Herself—And WonWhat It’s Like to Have Long COVID As a Kid22 Essential Works of Indigenous CinemaMeet TIME's Newest Class of Next Generation LeadersContact us at letters@time.comEdit PostHomeU.S.PoliticsWorldHealthBusinessTechPersonal Finance by TIME StampedShopping by TIME StampedFuture of Work by CharterEntertainmentIdeasScienceHistorySportsMagazineThe TIME VaultTIME For KidsTIMECO2CouponsTIME EdgeVideoMastheadNewslettersSubscribeDigital MagazineGive a GiftShop the TIME StoreCareersModern Slavery StatementPress RoomTIME StudiosU.S. & Canada Customer CareGlobal Help CenterContact the EditorsReprints and PermissionsSite MapMedia KitSupplied Partner ContentAbout Us© 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

Opens in a new tab or window email article In the absence of PCR testing, infectious disease experts and epidemiologists are anxiously awaiting serology results from the household contact and two healthcare workers who may have been infected with H5N1 bird flu by a patient in Missouri who tested positive for the disease. The CDC said in an announcement last week that Missouri health officials collected blood samples from the case and that person's household contact, which are being sent to the CDC "for serologic testing to look for antibodies to avian influenza A(H5) virus, which would indicate a previous infection." The first healthcare worker who developed respiratory symptoms tested negative for influenza; it is unclear if this person will have serology testing. However, CDC said the second healthcare worker, who was not tested for flu, "will be offered" serology testing. "Not obtaining serology and immune testing at this point would be public health malpractice," James Lawler, MD, MPH, of the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Global Center for Health Security in Omaha, told MedPage Today. "We must investigate this potential cluster to the fullest extent possible." If H5N1 antibodies are detected on serology, "that essentially confirms that these were related H5N1 cases and very likely from human-to-human transmission," Lawler said. "There is no other reason for a person to have an immune record of H5 infection, and without clear risky exposure to animals or milk, a human cluster is most likely the result of human-to-human transmission." Lawler said that in addition to antibody testing, tests of T-cell response should be conducted, "because not everyone who is infected with influenza virus develops a robust antibody response." Amesh Adalja, MD, of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, cautioned that "other respiratory viruses were circulating in high levels at that time, including COVID." The case was hospitalized on August 22. There's been limited transmission of H5N1 to caregivers in the past, Adalja said, but it would be "helpful to understand if transmission occurred." Lawler cautioned that while small clusters of H5N1 infection in humans have been observed, "exposure to poultry is often shared among family members, and to my knowledge, investigations have never confirmed human-to-human transmission with this virus." "If it has occurred in the past, it is quite rare," he said. "So, if we are seeing human-to-human transmission now, it is a big deal." He added that the "timing and circumstances that have been discussed publicly suggest that human-to-human transmission is certainly possible." Neither Adalja nor Lawler suspect there is widespread, sustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1 at this time. Rather, Adalja said there is likely cattle-to-human transmission in Missouri: "Given that the strain is very similar to the strain circulating in dairy cattle, I assume that Missouri, even though it denies having any dairy herds positive, likely does have positive dairy herds." He also criticized Missouri health officials for not inviting CDC officials on site to help with their investigation: "It seems that they would rather evade the fact that their dairy cattle likely harbor the virus than get a handle on what is happening." Lawler and Adalja said it would be helpful to understand how the Missouri case became infected in the first place. "Even sporadic cases of human-to-human transmission indicate a big change in the virus and suggest it is exploring new directions in virus evolution that bring it closer to a pandemic virus," Lawler said.

A recent roundtable gathered together global experts to discuss how we can deliver on the promise of childhood vaccination programmes to help mitigate this burden.

Also referred to as simply ‘flu’, it is often thought that because seasonal influenza is common it is also harmless. While it is true that most people recover fully from flu, for certain high-risk groups – including the elderly, pregnant women and those with certain pre-existing medical conditions –influenza can cause severe illness and even death. Children are among those who may experience severe outcomes, with around 4 million influenza-related hospitalisations in those under 18 years, each year. Of children hospitalised with flu, about 1 in 5 need escalated care. The severe impact influenza can have on individual children consequently places a significant strain on healthcare systems. Seasonal influenza is associated with increased emergency admissions and use of inpatient critical beds, surges in hospitalisation causing cancellations of elective surgical procedures and depletion of the adult workforce. It is also notable that people most at risk of flu may also be vulnerable to other viral infections such as COVID-19; those with multiple simultaneous viral infections are at higher risk of severe illness and death. Harnessing the power of childhood influenza vaccination The good news is that seasonal influenza is largely preventable. Vaccination is the single most effective way that we have to protect against flu. Moreover, childhood flu vaccination programmes not only protect children, but also reduce community transmission and secondary cases amongst those at high risk and unprotected by vaccination. This is because children are important in community and household transmission of flu. They are responsible for up to 20% of all flu transmission outside the household and play a central role in transmission within households, but generally respond well to influenza vaccination. Vaccinating children therefore not only offers important protection to children themselves, but also may reduce transmission, thereby protecting the communities within which they reside. Moving toward a consensus It was this – the significant unmet opportunity presented by childhood influenza vaccination - that formed the focus of the inaugural Childhood Influenza Policy Steering Committee (CIPSC), organised and funded by AstraZeneca. Comprised of 15 experts from across the globe, who came together with the aim of establishing a consensus on how we can realise the potential benefits of widespread childhood flu vaccination. From a lively exchange of the committee’s wide-ranging expertise, experiences and ideas, several key areas of focus and alignment emerged: Access to flu vaccination must be convenient and make use of as many channels as possible: Making national vaccination programmes as efficient, accessible and convenient as possible is critical to increasing reach and uptake. School, nursery and community-based programmes – for example making vaccination available in local schools and pharmacies – means we can meet parents and children where they already are. By working with institutions that are already woven into the fabric of communities offers greater convenience, trust and familiarity which in turn can reduce missed appointments and improve vaccine uptake. Clear, consistent and compelling public health messaging should be a priority: Access is not enough without education. Myths and misunderstandings about flu and the role of vaccination persist and can act as barriers to vaccination. Regular reminders of the importance of taking steps to reduce risk of flu are needed annually so that members of the public can be reminded of the information they need to take steps to protect their health, their families and communities. Personal and specific anecdotes are also vital to engage those making choices about vaccination, as is listening to the doubts and concerns of those giving and receiving vaccines. We need to collect, report and share more data: Timely, accurate data is critical for helping us to change hearts and minds when it comes to the importance of childhood flu immunisation programmes. Currently, we have significant national variations and critical gaps in how we track and report seasonal influenza spread and the impact of annual flu vaccination. Introducing more robust surveillance mechanisms and better leveraging the data we do have is important for supporting effective decision-making and ensuring implementation of efficient and cost-effective vaccination programmes. We must continue to share best practice to inform national planning: Different countries and regions take diverse approaches to flu vaccine delivery. Regional, cultural and national variations are important and must be considered when we talk about the role of childhood flu immunisation. We have much to gain from listening to and learning from one another. We therefore encourage governments to explore and adapt current global best practice initiatives, depending on their national health and education systems. From consensus to action: The rich discussion at the expert roundtable highlighted the immense opportunity to reduce the personal, societal and economic burden of seasonal influenza by taking action to increase vaccine uptake in children. Together, the CIPSC urge governments and policymakers around the world to take specific actions to increase influenza vaccine coverage among children. You can read the joint consensus statement here.

No Fiction.”OHSU's Jonah Sacha, Ph.D. says new research could lead to a universal influenza vaccine within five years.Courtesy OHSU/Christine Torres HicksThe flu vaccine to end all flu vaccinesTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorThis year’s flu shot is rolling out and you’ll likely get the best protection if you get vaccinated by the end of October — before the viruses fully kick off their annual snotty reign-of-terror.There are many virus strains that cause what we call “the flu.” Every year, the World Health Organization uses disease data to predict which strains will cause the most problems. Then new vaccines are formulated to combat the most likely offenders.But what if there was a better way?Researchers at Oregon Health and Science University, the University of Washington and other institutions are working on a universal flu vaccine that could eventually mean your next flu shot will be your last.Current flu vaccines train your immune system to identify viruses based on their external features — kind of like the way we recognize people based on their faces. But the surfaces of viruses evolve to evade detection extremely quickly, which is one reason we need new vaccines every year.The new vaccine is designed to teach your immune system to seek-and-destroy based on what’s inside the virus. These innards evolve far slower — so slow, in fact, that when the researchers created a vaccine to recognize the 1918 Spanish flu (H1N1), it offered significant protection to animals exposed to H5N1 (bird flu), one of the most deadly viruses currently in circulation.The researchers estimate that within five years, this technology could lead to a universal flu vaccine that protects a person for their entire lives.The paper in Nature Communications can be read here.This conceptual illustration shows how different treatments can impact the severity of subsequent wildfires in the landscape. Areas that have received thinning and prescribed burn treatments fare better then areas left untreated or with only one treatment.Courtesy of Erica Sloniker/The Nature ConservancyYes, thinning and burning forests does reduce wildfire severityThe 2024 wildfire season is almost over but not before more than 1.2 million acres burned in Oregon. Once the rains start, a round of fall fuel treatments can begin. These treatments — like thinning out forests, pile burning and broader prescribed burning — are designed to reduce the risk of severe wildfire down the road.But for a long time, it’s been difficult to pin down just how effective the treatments are and which treatments work best.Researchers with the U.S. Forest Service and The Nature Conservancy analyzed the results of 40 studies and reports that measured the impacts of wildfires burning through treated and untreated forests. They found fire treatments in seasonally dry conifer forests (like those on the east side of the Cascades) can reduce fire severity by more than 70% compared to untreated areas that burn.The most effective kind of treatment was a combination of thinning and prescribed burns. And while using prescribed burning alone had a significant impact, solely relying on forest thinning didn’t reliably move the needle.The authors stress that fuel treatments need to be maintained over time. After 10 years, their impact on wildfire severity was significantly lower.Read more details in the journal Forest Ecology and Management here.This artistic rendering shows hydrothermal vents on the seafloor of the Saturnian moon Enceladus.Courtesy of NASA/JPL-CaltechEarth’s hydrothermal vents could predict life on other worldsTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorHydrothermal vents on the ocean floor are widely considered spots where life could have originated on Earth. The combination of heat and chemical energy released as water cycles up through the seafloor creates conditions where organic molecules can link up and form the building blocks of life.Earth likely isn’t the only ocean world in our solar system, and an international team, including scientists from Blue Marble Space in Seattle, wondered if similar hydrothermal vent systems could exist on one of our celestial neighbors.The researchers focused their attention on Europa (a moon of Jupiter) and Enceladus (a moon of Saturn), both of which are believed to have liquid water oceans encased in a thick layer of ice. Using a hydrothermal vent system located off the Pacific Northwest coast as a model, they ran computer simulations to see under what conditions vents could form on these moons.The team found that hydrothermal vent systems could exist under the ice on both moons, despite the vastly different gravities and geology to Earth. And they say the vents could have been active far longer than expected —potentially providing enough time for life to emerge.Read the paper published in JGR Planets here.

Sulfur dioxide in particular can cause significant respiratory problems in people. In early 2020, new global rules cut ships’ sulfur dioxide emissions by nearly 80%. It was great news for public health, but the impacts of these pollution cuts are playing out in surprising ways for the planet as a whole.When ships spew sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, the gas prompts the formation of clouds in the form of ship tracks over the ocean. These long white clouds help reflect the heat of the sun back into space, keeping the planet cool. But when the sulfur emissions decreased, so did the cloud cover.New research from Pacific Northwest National Lab is showing just how much of an impact the decline in ship tracks likely made in 2023, the planet’s warmest year on record. Their analysis showed the number of visible ship tracks have decreased 25-50%. And in areas where cloud-cover decreased there was generally more warming. The researchers estimated that up to 20% of the record warming in 2023 could be linked to limits on sulfur.The study was published in Geophysical Research Letters here.

Sounds great, right? Well a challenge for hydrogen comes on the front end — isolating the gas so it can be used as fuel.The most common way this is done is by creating a reaction between natural gas (methane) and steam to create isolated hydrogen. Problem is, one of the byproducts is carbon dioxide — a greenhouse gas. Hydrogen can also be created by splitting water molecules (H2O) with electricity, but this can be energy-intensive and expensive.Researchers at Oregon State University are working on what they hope is a better way. They’ve created a new photocatalyst — a chemical that uses energy from the sun to power a reaction — to split off hydrogen from water molecules. The reactions are fast and efficient - meaning it doesn’t take much solar energy to produce hydrogen.The results point to a new and promising path to explore in developing ways to produce clean hydrogen in a sustainable way.The research is published in the journal Angewandte Chemie here.In this monthly rundown from OPB, “All Science.

More troublingly, a household member also developed symptoms on the same day as the patient – but that person was not tested for the flu.There’s a blood test to check for antibodies to H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza, that may be done as soon as 10 days after infection, but antibody testing has not started, CDC officials said on Thursday.The patient with a confirmed infection responded to lengthy questionnaires on recent activities, such as doing yard work, having a bird feeder, keeping any pets at home, visiting agricultural fairs or petting zoos, eating undercooked meat, or drinking raw milk. Nothing raised alarm bells with officials about potential exposures.“Thus far, epidemiologists have not found a clear source of exposure,” said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC.US repeating Covid mistakes with bird flu as spread raises alarm, experts sayRead more“Missouri is working really hard to go deeper into the [epidemiology] to see if there are any unperceived exposures that are possible,” said Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.Genomic sequencing revealed that the strain is related to the virus that probably began circulating among dairy cows late last year; the bovine-adapted variant has since spilled into other wild and domesticated animals, including birds and mammals.The patient’s sample showed at least two mutations, including one that might make current vaccine candidates for H5N1 less effective.Shah told reporters last Thursday there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission, calling the event a likely “one-off” case.“None of the individuals that this individual came into contact with have developed any signs and symptoms,” Shah said on Thursday.Yet last Friday, the CDC reported the other two symptomatic contacts, one of which was shared “subsequently” by Missouri.The CDC has not been invited by Missouri to help with the investigation, although federal officials are in touch with the state via phone and video calls, Shah said.The CDC has limited authority for state- and local-level compliance, and recent supreme court decisions may have a chilling effect on regulatory action.Missouri has been in “very close consultation” with the CDC since detecting the case, “but we have not had a need for more extensive on-site assistance at this time as we are still limited to one case with low risk of sustained transmission”, Lisa Cox, communications director for the Missouri department of health and senior services, told the Guardian.Only 240 people or so have been tested for H5N1 in the 2024 outbreak, according to the CDC. Typically, tests are done only when someone in close contact with infected animals develops symptoms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Health workers suspected a respiratory infection such as the seasonal influenza, but the swab was not fast-tracked as a potential H5N1 infection, Shah said. Instead, it was sent to the state laboratory with other flu A samples to be double-checked as part of routine surveillance looking for any types of unusual flu strains.This kind of monitoring usually happens during the winter flu season, but in May the CDC recommended states continue monitoring flu A through the summer because of ongoing outbreaks on poultry and dairy farms.This is the first time an H5N1 case has been detected using the national flu surveillance system.“Our influenza surveillance system is designed to find needles in haystacks, and as this case and others show, it is working,” Shah said. “We found such a needle, but we don’t know how it got there.”Missouri has not reported any cases of H5N1 in cows, but the state had only tested 17 of about 60,000 dairy cows as of July. The most recent outbreak of bird flu among Missouri poultry was reported in February.There have not been any unusual levels of flu activity or emergency department visits in this area compared with last year’s levels, Shah said. “But our investigation is not over.”The patient in Missouri, who has “significant” underlying conditions, experienced “acute” symptoms of chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and weakness, Shah said.“The patient has underlying chronic medical conditions, and respiratory symptoms were not the leading cause for hospitalization on admission,” Cox said. The patient was not severely ill, was hospitalized for three days, and has recovered.It is possible that the individual’s existing medical conditions made them more vulnerable to illness, Shah said.As the virus continues to spread among animals, officials remain on alert for more cases among people, Shah said. “As more animal species exhibit and harbor H5, the possibility of animal-human interaction goes up, and thus the possibility of human cases goes up.”Explore more on these topicsMissouriBird fluInfectious diseasesMedical researchHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldEuropeUSAmericasAsiaAustraliaMiddle EastAfricaInequalityGlobal developmentNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Furthermore, despite a summer surge in COVID activity and last year’s 199 pediatric flu deaths, only 38% of Americans surveyed said they plan to get a flu shot this year, and 26% said they would get a COVID vaccine. The survey was conducted August 8 to 12 and included 1,160 respondents. Concern over COVID has dropped The annual press conference is meant to kick off annual vaccination season, but the survey results show a population that has moved on from the COVID-19 pandemic and is wary of annual vaccinations. Concern about COVID-19 has dropped from 34% in 2022 to 20% in 2024, and only 17% polled said they were concerned about flu. A similar trend was seen concerning masking: 19% of those polled say they will wear a mask in a doctor’s office, pharmacy, or hospital this fall and winter, and only 49% will wear a mask in healthcare settings this fall and winter if they are required to do so.The survey results revealed some cognitive dissonance among Americans: 67% of those polled agreed that annual flu vaccination is the most effective way to prevent flu-related hospitalizations and deaths, yet many still will refuse to get vaccinated. "The single most important thing folks can do to protect themselves as we get into fall and winter is get vaccinated,” said Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, during the news conference. Cohen is the director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). During the news conference, Cohen got a flu shot. "I wouldn't recommend something to the American people that I wouldn't recommend for myself, family and loved ones," she said. I wouldn’t recommend something to the American people that I wouldn’t recommend for myself, family and loved ones.The NFID survey also reported that only 16% are concerned about RSV, and 17% are concerned about pneumococcal disease. Among adults for whom RSV vaccines are recommended, 21% say they will definitely get vaccinated this upcoming season. Vaccines prevented thousands of hospitalizationsThroughout the press conference, experts from the NFID and CDC reminded Americans that even if vaccination doesn't completely protect against infection, in can lessen the severity of disease if a person gets sick. Demetre Daskalakis, MD, MPH, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, said during the 2023-24 flu season, there were between 380,000 and 900,000 flu hospitalizations, and the CDC estimates that flu vaccination prevented 105,000 to 240,000 hospitalizations. During the 2023-24 typical respiratory virus season (October through April) there were an estimated 500,000 to 800,000 COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, and COVID-19 vaccination likely prevented an additional 40,000 to 100,000 hospitalizations.

Photo by Jeff Gritchen / Digital First Media / Orange County Register via Getty ImagesThe Food and Drug Administration has approved a nasally administered influenza immunization treatment that can be taken at home. FluMist — a nasal spray vaccine that AstraZeneca initially developed as an in-office treatment two decades ago — will still require a prescription to obtain and is expected to be made available via a new online pharmacy next year, according to The New York Times.The treatment will require people to fill out a questionnaire on the upcoming FlueMist Home website. Once approved by a pharmacist, the nasal spray will be shipped directly to the customer’s door. The current out-of-pocket cost is around $35 to $45 per dose, according to the NYT, but that may drop depending on insurance coverage.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that FluMist has a similar efficacy to the traditional shot. It has been available through healthcare providers ever since it was first approved by the FDA back in 2003. It’s suitable for people aged between 2 to 49 years old — though the FDA recommends that the nasal spray be administered by a parent / caregiver to anyone under 18. The spray could be an alternative for people who are averse to getting injections or otherwise find it difficult or inconvenient to travel for flu immunization treatments.“Today’s approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families,” said the FDA’s vaccine center director, Dr. Peter Marks. The World Health Organization reports that there are around a billion annual cases of seasonal influenza, resulting in 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths each year.CommentsMost PopularMost PopularCash App users have a week left to claim part of a $15 million settlementAnalogue’s 4K Nintendo 64 launches next year for $249Mattel accidentally linked a porn site on Wicked doll packagingBluesky adds 700,000 new users in a weekValve finally made a white Steam Deck that you can actually buyVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Despite anticipated US growth, Europe will remain AstraZeneca's most lucrative market for FIuMist due to stronger recommendations and coverage.AstraZeneca’s influenza vaccine, FluMist (influenza virus vaccine, intranasal) will see increased US demand following the FDA’s approval for self-administration. On September 20 2024, AstraZeneca’s nasal spray influenza vaccine, FluMist, was approved by the FDA for self-administration or by a caregiver in certain patients. The approval makes FluMist the first influenza vaccine approved in the US which does not need to be administered by a healthcare provider. This improved convenience will drive demand as eligible patients will be more likely to use the vaccine given that they will not need to travel to their healthcare provider for administration. The approval allows adults up to 49 years of age to self-administer the vaccine, while patients aged two to 17 years old can receive the vaccine from a caregiver. The FDA’s decision was based on a data submission from AstraZeneca which included results from a usability study highlighting that adults aged 18 years and older could self-administer FluMist or administer it to others. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that flu caused 35mn illnesses, 400,000 hospitilisations and 25,000 deaths in the 2023-2024 season. Improved convenience and accessibility will give FluMist an advantage over competitors. FluMist was first approved by the FDA in 2003 for patients aged five to 49 years old and in 2007 the FDA approved the vaccine for children aged two to five years old. The vaccines method of administration differentiates it from its competitors, all of which are administered via injection, including GSK’s Flulaval (influenza virus vaccine), Sanofi’s Fluzone and Flublok (influenza virus vaccine, injection) and CSL Sequiris’s Fluad and Flucelvax (influenza virus vaccine, injection). Alongside the option for self-administration, this latest approval will enable patients to order FluMist for delivery directly to their homes through AstraZeneca’s FluMist Home service, an online pharmacy platform which the company plans to launch soon. This combination of self-administration and home delivery will help drive sales, attracting new patients and encouraging more individuals to opt for vaccination without the need to visit a healthcare provider. Despite anticipated US growth, Europe will remain AstraZeneca's most lucrative market for FIuMist due to stronger recommendations and coverage. FluMist sales in Europe are significantly higher than those in the US. Demand in Europe is supported by stronger recommendations and coverage in certain European markets compared to the US. For instance, FluMist is a key part of national influenza campaigns in the UK and Ireland. AstraZeneca had also initially aimed for its self-administration approval in Q1 2024 to launch FluMist ahead of the 2024-2025 season. This later approval may therefore hinder short-term sales prospects. Flu vaccine uptake in the US remains highest among adults aged 65 years and older, suggesting that AstraZeneca's US sales will struggle to reach those of its competitors, including Sanofi, which target older age groups. Vaccine hesitancy is likely to represent a significant barrier to vaccination among the US population. A survey conducted by Ohio State Wexner Medical Center found that less than half of the US population are planning to get flu vaccinations in the upcoming flu season, suggesting potential sales headwinds for influenza vaccine manufacturers.

According to the CDC: Every year, flu vaccination prevents illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations and deaths. Flu vaccination is an important preventive tool for people with chronic health conditions. Flu vaccination has been associated with lower rates of some cardiac events among in people with heart disease. It is important for those who are pregnant to get vaccinated to protect from flu illness and hospitalization. Vaccination has been shown to help protect the baby from flu infection for several months after birth, before the baby can be vaccinated. While some people who get vaccinated still get sick, flu vaccination has been shown in several studies to reduce the severity of illness. Your protection from a flu vaccine declines over time. Yearly vaccination is needed for the best protection. For more information, visit the CDC website or call 1-800-CDC-INFO. Did you find this article helpful?

The Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Iowa State University tests samples from animals for viruses such as avian influenza. . Photo: Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory By Julie Steenhuysen and Bhanvi Satija Sept 20 (Reuters) - A second Missouri healthcare worker who had contact with a hospitalized patient infected with bird flu developed mild respiratory symptoms but was not tested for the virus, U.S. officials said on Friday. The number of people who were in contact with the hospitalized bird flu patient in Missouri and developed symptoms is now up to three, officials said. All three have recovered. The other two symptomatic cases included a healthcare worker who tested negative for influenza and a household contact of the patient who developed symptoms at the same time as the hospitalized patient, but was never tested. Unlike prior U.S. bird flu cases this year, the Missouri patient had no known contact with infected animals, raising concerns the virus currently circulating in dairy cattle may have mutated in a way that makes it spread more easily in people. CDC officials said in a Sept. 12 briefing the agency has been unable to determine if the Missouri case was related to the virus infecting U.S. dairy cattle. Missouri is leading the state's bird flu investigation with remote assistance from the CDC. The state's health officials said in an email last week Missouri is considering taking blood samples to look for antibodies that would indicate prior exposure to bird flu. The CDC said serologic testing will be offered to the second healthcare worker. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the results of the blood tests will be critical. "We'll need the serology results to assess whether this is evidence of H5 transmission," she said, adding that COVID-19 activity was also high in August and the symptoms were easy to confuse. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert with the University of Minnesota, also said it could be "any number of respirartory illnesses". The confirmed Missouri case occurred in a patient who was admitted to the hospital with underlying health conditions and was tested for influenza as a part of their workup. It was unclear whether the patient's underlying conditions caused the symptoms or the flu. The Missouri case was the 14th person in the United States to be diagnosed with bird flu this year. The other 13 cases were among farm workers and linked to bird flu outbreaks on poultry or dairy farms. Bird flu has infected more than 200 dairy herds in 14 states since March, according to US Department of Agriculture data.

It can be difficult to determine what virus you have based on symptoms alone. The only way to confirm a diagnosis is by testing. Experts say that knowing what virus you have can be useful for determining treatment options or potentially protecting others from becoming ill. Most respiratory illnesses get better on their own, and treatment typically includes drinking fluids and getting plenty of rest. Antiviral drugs are available for high-risk populations. How Are Symptoms of COVID-19, the Flu, and RSV Different? Symptoms of these respiratory illnesses overlap significantly. A fever, cough, sore throat, and stuffy or runny nose are all symptoms that can show up if you have COVID, the flu, or RSV. Here's a look at the most common symptoms of these illnesses and what ones are more likely to occur with each: Symptoms COVID Flu RSV Cough Common Common Common Diarrhea Sometimes Sometimes* Rarely Fatigue Common Usually Sometimes Fever or chills Common Usually Common Headache Common Common Sometimes Loss of appetite Sometimes Sometimes Common Muscle or body aches Common Usually Sometimes Nausea or vomiting Sometimes Sometimes* Rarely New loss of taste or smell Sometimes Rarely Rarely Shortness of breath Common Rarely Sometimes* Sneezing Rarely Sometimes Common Sore throat Common Sometimes Sometimes Stuffy or runny nose Common Sometimes Usually Wheezing Rarely Rarely Common *Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea from the flu and shortness of breath from RSV more common in children. The onset of symptoms may be able to provide you with clues. The flu, in particular, has been known to have a very short incubation period. Symptoms show up soon after exposure, anywhere from one to four days from when a person was infected. Flu symptoms also tend to come on quickly and all at once. Many people with the flu say it feels like they've been "hit by a truck" when symptoms appear. COVID and RSV tend to be more gradual in their symptom onset and have a slightly longer incubation period. COVID's incubation period can range from two to 14 days after exposure, depending on what variant you've been infected with. RSV has an incubation period of four to eight days. However, trying to diagnose yourself based on symptoms and symptom onset alone isn't foolproof. There's not a precise way to be able to say with any certainty what illness you have without testing. Diagnosis The only true way to know what virus you can attribute your symptoms to is to take a test. Healthcare providers can test for multiple viruses at once, which can be especially beneficial if your symptoms match all three viruses. With similar symptoms for all three viruses, is it even necessary to get an exact diagnosis? Yes. Knowing what illness you have can give you more information to provide to anyone you may have infected, especially those who are at high risk. It can also help you feel better faster. COVID At-home COVID tests are available, which provide results quickly. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are generally more accurate than these tests, but the results take longer to receive. You can get PCR tests in a clinical setting. Flu A healthcare provider can diagnose the flu by asking about your health history and symptoms. They can also swab the inside of your nose or the back of your throat to collect a sample. Similar to COVID, there are two types of flu tests. A rapid influenza antigen test can provide results quickly, but it's not always accurate. A PCR test is also available at a healthcare provider's office. This test may take longer to give results, but it's more accurate than a rapid test. RSV RSV produces illness in both children and adults, but it has largely affected children and can be particularly dangerous for them. A healthcare provider will likely ask about your health history and symptoms. They can also perform a physical exam and collect nasal fluid for a lab test. If symptoms are severe, you or your child may require a chest X-ray or blood and urine tests. Treatment Most viral infections get better on their own without treatment, but some people require antiviral drugs. It's important to note that antibiotics don't treat viral infections. A healthcare provider may recommend drinking fluids and getting plenty of rest. You can also take a fever reducer or pain reliever to manage symptoms. COVID Paxlovid (nirmatrelviritonavir) is an antiviral treatment for people at high risk of developing severe COVID symptoms. It's only available by prescription and has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by 88%. This treatment comes with the risk of "Paxlovid rebound," or the recurrence of COVID symptoms after treatment. Rebound illness has also affected people who haven't taken Paxlovid. Flu There are treatments for the flu, which are particularly recommended for young children, older adults, and those with a weak immune system. Antiviral drugs can help you get better quicker and lessen the risk of complications. It's best to start these medications within two days of symptom onset. RSV Most cases of RSV, like COVID and the flu, go away on their own within one to two weeks. You can treat a fever and painful symptoms with an over-the-counter (OTC) medication like Advil (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen). Keep in mind that children should never take aspirin. Severe infections require hospitalization. You or your child may receive a breathing tube, oxygen therapy, or a ventilator. How To Prevent Respiratory Illnesses All of these viruses are caused by person-to-person contact through infectious droplets. This typically means inhaling virus-laden droplets from the air when an infected person is talking, coughing, sneezing, or otherwise ejecting them from their mouth or nose. You can also pick them up on surfaces and transport them to your nose, eyes, or mouth. Safe and effective vaccines are available for COVID and the flu. They may not protect against symptomatic disease entirely. Vaccines can still greatly reduce the risk of hospitalization and death and potentially lessen symptoms if you do end up getting a breakthrough infection. The same precautions used during the COVID pandemic are helpful regardless of the virus at hand. You can prevent these respiratory illnesses by: Avoiding close contact if you're sick or with sick people Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces if they come into contact with infectious droplets Regularly washing your hands with soap and water Using hand sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable A Quick Review COVID, the flu, and RSV are respiratory illnesses that share similar symptoms, such as a cough, fever, sore throat, and runny or stuffy nose. These illnesses are caused by different viruses. The only way to confirm what virus you have is to test. Knowing what virus you have can help protect others from becoming ill. Other ways to prevent respiratory illnesses include cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, washing your hands regularly, and staying up-to-date on vaccines. Was this page helpful?

Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email HEALTH Nasal spray flu vaccine gets FDA approval for home use: ‘A good alternative’ This is the first time an influenza vaccine has been approved for use without a medical provider By Melissa Rudy Fox News Published September 23, 2024 3:39pm EDT Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Dr. Nicole Saphier on 'good alternative' for flu shot Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier weighs in on the FDA approving an at-home nasal spray flu vaccine and 12 Tufts University lacrosse players being diagnosed with Rhabdomyolysis, a rare muscle condition. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved FluMist — the nasal spray flu vaccine — for home use by a patient or adult caregiver, the agency announced. FluMist has been in use for a couple of decades, but this is the first time a vaccine for influenza has been approved for self-administration without a health care provider. "Today’s approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine, potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families," said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in the Sept. 20 announcement. FLU SHOT SCHEDULING: WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO GET THE VACCINE? The home version of FluMist will be available starting next year, according to Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a nasal spray flu vaccine for home use by a patient or adult caregiver. (iStock) Saphier appeared on "Fox and Friends" to discuss how the home version of FluMist will make it easier for people to get the vaccine."A lot of people don’t get the flu shot because of the logistics of going to the doctor’s office or the pharmacy, or because of severe needle phobia," she said. "This is a good alternative for those people — especially because over the last two decades, [FluMist] has shown just about the same efficacy as the traditional vaccines."'VACCINE FATIGUE' BLAMED AS ROUGHLY HALF OF PEOPLE IN US WILL SKIP COVID AND FLU SHOTS THIS YEAR Dr. Marc Siegel, senior medical analyst for Fox News and clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, stated that the FluMist vaccine is "particularly useful" in children who may have needle phobias. "I am glad it is being made available over the counter beginning next year," he told Fox News Digital. "It can help to overcome vaccine non-compliance.""A lot of people don’t get the flu shot because of the logistics of going to the doctor’s office or the pharmacy, or because of severe needle phobia." It is still important for doctors to be "kept in the loop," Siegel added. "It is a live virus vaccine, and so it should not be given to those who are immunocompromised or to pregnant women." Each year between 2010 and 2023, the flu has caused between 9.3 million and 41 million illnesses, 100,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, and 4,900 to 51,000 deaths, according to the CDC. (iStock)FluMist is approved to protect against influenza virus subtypes A and B in people 2 through 49 years of age, according to the FDA’s website. It was first approved in 2003 for people ages 5 through 49, and was extended to include children ages 2 through 5 in 2007. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The most common side effects of FluMist include fever in children between 2 and 6, runny nose and nasal congestion in people aged 2 through 49, and sore throat in adults aged 18 through 49, the FDA noted. The home nasal vaccine could help to reduce vaccine "non-compliance," a doctor said. (iStock)A prescription will be required to obtain the home version of FluMist, which will be shipped directly from a third-party online pharmacy to eligible patients, the FDA stated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older is advised to get vaccinated against influenza.CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Last year’s vaccine had an efficacy of a little less than 50% in terms of keeping people out of the doctor’s office and the hospital, according to Saphier. "Does that mean that everyone needs to go get one? That’s really up to the individual," she said, adding that people should talk to their doctor, especially if they are high-risk. FluMist is approved to protect against influenza virus subtypes A and B in people 2 through 49 years of age, according to the FDA’s website. (iStock)In the FDA’s announcement, Marks stated that getting annual vaccinations is the best way to prevent influenza, "which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death."

Based on their preclinical studies, the researchers say the broad-spectrum nasal spray is long-lasting, safe, and, if validated in humans, could play a key role in reducing respiratory diseases and safeguarding public health against new threats. Their results are published in the journal Advanced Materials. The COVID pandemic showed us what respiratory pathogens can do to humanity in a very short time. That threat hasn't gone away. Not only do we have the flu to deal with seasonally, but we now have COVID, too." Jeffrey Karp, PhD, Distinguished Chair, Anesthesiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital Influenza and COVID-19 infections cause thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of cases of severe disease every year. Milder infections cause significant discomfort, resulting in missed work or school. Vaccines against these viruses can be beneficial, but they're imperfect. Vaccinated people still get infected and spread the infection to others. Masks are also helpful but aren't perfect, either -; they can leak, and many people wear them improperly or choose not to wear them at all. "We need new, additional ways to protect ourselves and reduce the transmission of the disease," Karp said. Most viruses enter our system through the nose. When we catch an airborne infection like the flu and COVID, we breathe out tiny droplets of fluids that contain the pathogen. Healthy people around us breathe in these pathogen-containing droplets, which attach inside their nose and infect the cells that line the nasal passageways. The pathogen replicates and can be released back into the air when an individual who is sick, whether they know it or not, sneezes, coughs, laughs, sings, or even just breathes. Related StoriesStudy uncovers OLAH as key driver of fatal respiratory diseaseStudy links air pollution and limited green spaces to higher respiratory hospitalization risk​​​​​​​Rice and Baylor receive $2.8 million to suppress inflammation and lung damage in ARDS patientsThe new study details the research team's efforts to create a nasal spray to defend against airborne respiratory illness. "The spray, called Pathogen Capture and Neutralizing Spray (PCANS) in the paper, was developed using ingredients from the FDA's Inactive Ingredient Database (IID), which have been previously used in approved nasal sprays, or from the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) list of the FDA," said co-senior author Nitin Joshi, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital. "We developed a drug-free formulation using these compounds to block germs in three ways -; PCANS forms a gel-like matrix that traps respiratory droplets, immobilizes the germs, and effectively neutralizes them, preventing infection." The researchers did the experiments detailed in the study under laboratory settings. They have not studied PCANS directly in humans. The researchers developed the formulation and studied its ability to capture respiratory droplets in a 3D-printed replica of a human nose. They showed that when sprayed in the nasal cavity replica, PCANS captured twice as many droplets as mucus alone. "PCANS forms a gel, increasing its mechanical strength by a hundred times, forming a solid barrier," said primary author John Joseph, PhD, a former postdoctoral fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. "It blocked and neutralized almost 100% of all viruses and bacteria we tested, including Influenza, SARS-CoV-2, RSV, adenovirus, K Pneumonia and more." Experiments in mice showed that a single dose of the PCANS nasal spray could effectively block infection from an influenza virus (PR8) at 25 times the lethal dose. Virus levels in the lungs were reduced by >99.99%, and the inflammatory cells and cytokines in the lungs of PCANS-treated animals were normal. "The formulation's ability to inactivate a broad spectrum of pathogens, including the deadly PR8 influenza virus, demonstrates its high effectiveness," said co-senior author Yohannes Tesfaigzi, PhD, AstraZeneca Professor of Medicine in the Field of Respiratory and Inflammatory Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital. "In a rigorous mouse model study, prophylactic treatment with PCANS demonstrated exceptional efficacy, with treated mice exhibiting complete protection, while the untreated group showed no such benefit." While the study's limitations include the lack of human studies of PCANS, it provides a strong foundation for future research to explore the full potential of PCANS in a broader context. The researchers are exploring whether PCANS can also block allergens, opening a potential new avenue for allergy relief. Source:Brigham and Women's HospitalJournal reference:Joseph, J., et al.

FluMist will also remain available at medical offices and pharmacies for administration by healthcare professionals. The FDA’s decision was informed by a comprehensive submission, including a usability study that confirmed individuals over 18 years could correctly self-administer FluMist, as well as administer it to eligible persons aged two to 49 years. The study found that 100% of the intended users successfully administered a full dose. Data indicated that the efficacy, immunogenicity and adverse events associated with self-administration of FluMist are comparable to those observed with healthcare professional-administered vaccinations. The FluMist label has been updated to include additional instructions for ordering and self or caregiver administration. However, children aged two to eight years with an uncertain vaccination history may not qualify for caregiver administration and are advised to consult a healthcare provider. AstraZeneca vaccines and immune therapies executive vice-president Iskra Reic stated: “The approval of FluMist for self-administration is an important step forward in making vaccines more accessible to fight the high annual burden of influenza. “For more than 20 years, FluMist has been the only nasal spray flu vaccine licensed in the US and now it is also the only vaccine to help individuals, families and communities access an influenza vaccine conveniently through self and caregiver administration outside of traditional healthcare settings.” Sign up for our daily news round-up!

As with other drugs, FluMist can cause side effects, such as runny nose and headache.Healthcare professionals may refer to FluMist as FluMist Trivalent. This is because the vaccine guards against three types of the flu virus. There used to be a version of the vaccine — FluMist Quadrivalent — that guarded against four types of the flu virus. But this version is no longer available. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), all U.S. flu vaccines will be trivalent for the 2024 to 2025 season.More common side effects of FluMist Some FluMist nasal spray vaccine side effects are more common than others. The side effects may be temporary, lasting a few days to weeks. However, if the side effects last longer than that, bother you, or become severe, be sure to talk with your doctor or pharmacist.These are just a few of the more common side effects reported by people who received FluMist in clinical trials:headachelethargyrunny or stuffy nosesore throattiredness or weaknessMild side effects of FluMist Mild side effects can occur with FluMist. This list doesn’t include all possible mild side effects of the drug. For more information, you can refer to the vaccine’s prescribing information.Mild side effects that have been reported with FluMist include:coughdecreased appetiteheadachelethargyrunny or stuffy nosesore throattiredness or weaknessmuscle achesThese side effects may be temporary, lasting a few days to weeks. However, if the side effects last longer than that, bother you, or become severe, be sure to talk with your doctor or pharmacist.Note: After the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves a drug, it tracks and reviews side effects of the medication. If you develop a side effect after receiving FluMist and want to tell the FDA about it, you can do so online via the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) or call 800-822-7967. You can also contact the vaccine’s manufacturer (MedImmune) at 877-633-4411.Serious side effects of FluMist FluMist may cause serious side effects, but they aren’t common. There were no reports of serious side effects in clinical trials of FluMist. The serious side effects listed below have been reported after the vaccine was approved. For more information, you can refer to the FluMist prescribing information.If you develop serious side effects while taking FluMist, call your doctor right away. If the side effects seem life threatening or you think you’re having a medical emergency, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number.Serious side effects and their symptoms include:pericarditis (inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart), which may include symptoms such as: chest pain, which may get worse when lying down or coughingcoughfatigueheart palpitations (fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat)shortness of breath when lying downvaccine-associated encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), which may include symptoms such as: feverseizuressensitivity to light or soundsevere headachestiff neckBell’s palsy (see “Side effect specifics” for details)Guillain-Barré syndrome (see “Side effect specifics” for details)ALLERGIC REACTIONFor some people, FluMist vaccine can cause an allergic reaction. But it’s not clear whether this side effect occurred in the drug’s clinical trials.In general, symptoms of allergic reaction can be mild or serious.Ways to manageFor mild allergic reaction symptoms, such as a mild rash, call your doctor right away. They may recommend treatments to help manage your symptoms. They’ll also let you know whether you should keep taking the medication.For severe allergic reaction symptoms, such as swelling or trouble breathing, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. These symptoms require immediate medical care because they can become life threatening. If you’ve had a serious allergic reaction to FluMist, your doctor may recommend taking a different medication instead.FAQ about the side effects of FluMist FluMist may cause several side effects. Here are some frequently asked questions about the drug’s side effects and their answers.How do the side effects of FluMist vs. flu shot compare?Side effects of FluMist and the injection form of the flu vaccine (Fluzone, Afluria, others) are similar. Both kinds of vaccine can cause headache, muscle aches, and other flu-like symptoms. Because the flu shot is an injection, it’s possible to have a reaction at the injection site. This typically includes soreness, redness, or swelling in the area where the injection was given. If you’d like more information, you can read this article about flu shot side effects.Talk with your doctor about the flu shot and FluMist nasal flu vaccine pros and cons. Together, you can decide which one is best for you. Note: The FDA has approved FluMist for use only in people ages 2 through 49 years. If you’re in a different age group, your doctor will likely recommend getting a flu shot. For more information, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. How long after the nasal flu vaccine do side effects start?In people receiving FluMist in clinical trials, side effects started within 10 to 14 days. Side effects from FluMist are generally expected to be mild and short term, lasting only a few days. See the “More common side effects of FluMist” section for details. If you have side effects that persist or bother you, talk with your doctor or pharmacist. They’ll be able to recommend some ways to relieve your symptoms.Side effect specifics Learn more about some of the side effects that FluMist may cause.

Michael Buckner/Getty Images for FluMist QuadrivalentThe FDA has approved an at-home nasal flu vaccine.FluMist will be available through an online pharmacy for people ages 2-49.However, it is not for the very young, older adults, or the immunocompromised.Experts say it will expand access to flu vaccinations and keep more people safe.However, injectable vaccines are safe for a wider range of populations.On September 20, 2024, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) announced they had approved an at-home nasal spray influenza (flu) vaccine.The vaccine, FluMist, can be administered by either the recipient or their caregiver. It is sprayed into the nose.FluMist prevents cases of the flu caused by influenza virus subtypes A and B. It can be administered to people between the ages of 2 and 49.The nasal flu vaccine is not an entirely new medication, however. It was first approved for usage in 2003 for people from age 5 to 49. Later, in 2007, FDA approval was given to lower the minimum age to 2.Now, it has become the first flu vaccine that can be administered without the assistance of a healthcare professional.The FDA states that the vaccine manufacturer will be making the vaccine available through a third-party online pharmacy.To obtain FluMist, people can undergo a screening process, and the pharmacy will prescribe and ship the vaccine.Flu vaccines play an essential role in controlling seasonal flu outbreaks. On average, about 700,000 people die each year from the disease’s respiratory and cardiovascular complications. However, the flu used to be much more deadly before a vaccine was developed.While many people will only experience relatively mild symptoms, the flu is a contagious illness that can be passed along to those who are more vulnerable.Older people, young children, and people with certain medical conditions are most at risk, per the FDA.The availability of FluMist could make it easier for more people to be vaccinated and help protect those who are at greater risk.How FluMist compares with injectable flu vaccinesAndrew Handel, MD, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Stony Brook Children’s Hospital, explained that there are different types of flu vaccines available in the U.S.“Injectable vaccines consist of inactivated (dead) virus or viral particles, whereas FluMist is a live, attenuated (or weakened) influenza vaccine given by nasal spray,” he said.According to Handel, some studies show that FluMist is more protective against infections and severe illness than injectable vaccines. However, not all studies are consistent.John Lowe, MD, a physician focused on preventive health at Restore Care, added to Handel’s comments saying, “It has this advantage over the injection in that it can elicit a more physiological sort of interaction with the immune system than the injection, which simply presents the body with a dead virus for the body to form an immune response against it.”Lowe went on to say that another way that FluMist contrasts with injectable vaccines is that it is not given to people under 2 or over 49 years of age.“The injectable form is incorporated for people in high-risk groups,” he said, explaining that it is even used for people who are immunocompromised.Additionally, Lowe said FluMist’s nasal route of administration could be more beneficial in preventing alveolar respiratory infections since the influenza virus enters the body through the nose.“On the other hand, the injectable preparation provides more consistent efficacy across pandemic and seasonal influenza as well as other vaccine-preventable diseases,” he added.Finally, Lowe noted that while both injectable vaccines and FluMist can provide immunization against the flu virus, injectables remain the first-line recommendation since they are safe for the majority of the population.What health experts think about FluMist“The approval of FluMist for self-administration at home is a huge step forward for the FDA,” said Handel, explaining that many people skip vaccines because of obstacles like having to take children out of school to get them.“Any effort to making vaccines more accessible will help increase uptake and keep more people safe,” he said.Lowe agreed, calling the FDA’s approval of FluMist “a welcome improvement.”He noted that a self-administered nasal flu vaccine could also be useful in arid regions or locations with an inadequate number of healthcare facilities.However, Lowe cautioned that FluMist is not appropriate for everyone, especially if they are immunocompromised.“Patients should be assessed, and it should be established that it is OK to recommend FluMist to them,” he said.TakeawayThe FDA has announced that it has approved an at-home nasal flu vaccine that is administered by spraying it into the nose.It can be used by people aged 2 to 49. However, it is not appropriate for very young children, older adults, or those who are immunocompromised.Injectables remain first-line vaccines because they are safe for a larger percentage of the population.FluMist will be available through an online pharmacy that will write the prescription and ship the medication to people’s homes.Experts say FluMist will help make vaccination against the flu more accessible to people who might otherwise have a hard time getting into a doctor’s office. This can help expand the number of people who are vaccinated.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Nancy Schimelpfening, MS on September 25, 2024 — Fact checked by Jill Seladi-Schulman, Ph.D.Read this nextWhy Getting Your Flu and COVID-19 Shots at the Same Time Is a Good Idea This YearInfectious disease experts recommend getting your flu shot and updated COVID-19 shot at the same time, ideally from late September through October.READ MOREMosquito-Borne Illnesses: Tips to Protect Yourself from West Nile Virus, Dengue, and EEEMosquito-borne illnesses are on the rise in the U.S. Here's how you can protect yourself from the 4 most common, including West Nile virus and dengue.READ MOREMpox Is ‘Not the New COVID,’ WHO Official Says.

Here’s how the flu vaccine can keep your kids and your entire family safe. 26-Sep-2024 1:05 PM EDT, by Children's Hospital Los Angeles contact patient services favorite_border Newswise — If it’s autumn, then it must be influenza season, which means it’s time to consider flu shots for your family.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American Academy of Pediatrics, and Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that everyone approved to receive a flu shot get one—including children ages 6 months and older.While getting the vaccine won’t necessarily prevent you and your loved ones from getting the flu, it can prevent severe and secondary illness related to it, according to Mona Patel, MD, Attending Physician in the Department of General Pediatrics at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.Dr. Patel notes that flu vaccines are critical for kids who may have conditions that put them at increased risk of illness. She adds that it’s particularly important to get a flu shot when flu season is overlapping with an outbreak of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19.“You never know how bad a flu season will be,” says Dr. Patel. “We like to think of flu shots as preventive care; getting one lessens the chances of more severe symptoms that may cause children to be hospitalized.”Why should we get flu shots every year?Influenza is dynamic. Like all viruses, it changes every year.Specifically, the outer coating of the virus is what changes every year. Vaccines, therefore, are designed to stimulate the production of antibodies that attach to the outer structures on the protein coat, basically disabling the virus.As Dr. Patel explains it, every year epidemiologists and immunologists at the CDC look at global patterns and start to predict what sort of viruses will be coming through. The formula for each season’s flu shot is based on these patterns and predictions.“If you got a flu shot last spring—basically, if you got it during the last flu season—it may not be effective against the flu that is circulating this season,” she says. “You never know which variant will be passing through, which is why the vaccine needs to be reformulated for every new flu season. That’s why we say it’s important for people to get their flu shots every single year.”When is a good time to get a flu shot?Fall and winter are the times of year when viruses that cause respiratory disease usually circulate more heavily in the community. Dr. Patel says the “typical” flu season starts around October and lasts through April, but the timing varies, and it can start earlier or end later.Dr. Patel says it’s a good idea to get a flu shot at the beginning of flu season every year, to maximize the benefits. She adds that for those who wait to get the shot, it’s always better late than never.“You want to get it early enough that it has maximal effect a few weeks later,” she says. “At the same time, I don’t want folks to say, ‘I missed it back in September and October, so I shouldn’t get it.’ If it’s flu season, you should get the shot. It’s better to have some protection than none.”How do RSV and Covid-19 complicate flu season?In any given year, the one-two punch of influenza and RSV presents a challenge for the U.S. health care system. Analysis from the CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics indicates that with the addition of COVID-19, even an average flu season can place significant strain on our health care system.While the prospect might seem daunting, Dr. Patel says she is hopeful that vaccines will make a difference. Vaccines for all three major respiratory viruses—flu, RSV (for younger children), and COVID-19—are available for this winter season.“Making sure that you are up to date on the vaccines recommended for you is an important strategy to prevent severe disease and protect yourself and others around you,” says Dr. Patel. “The more we can convince the public to use a public health preventive approach, the more effects we’ll see in the community.”To find a flu shot near you, please visit the California Department of Public Health website.

No problem.In a first, the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved a nasal spray flu vaccine for self-administration.Starting next fall, AstraZeneca's FluMist, which was authorized in 2003 to be administered by a health care provider, will be available to ordinary Americans through an online pharmacy. The needle-free spray would be shipped following a screening assessment. "Today's approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families," said top FDA official Peter Marks. Anyone over 18 will be authorized to administer the vaccine to themselves or another person. It is approved for use on anyone from age two to 49. FluMist is based on a weakened form of live influenza virus. Seasonal influenza causes around a billion infections every year, according to the World Health Organization, including up to 650,000 deaths. Since the 2020-21 season, vaccination rates have declined by 3.3 percent, but a recent survey indicates that at-home vaccination options could boost uptake.© Agence France-Presse Trending News Scientists Found a 'Yellow Brick Road' at The Bottom of The Pacific Ocean Nature4 days ago Huge Study Shows Where Gout Comes From, And It's Not What We Thought Health6 days ago One Stage of Sleep Seems to Be Critical in Reducing Dementia Risk Health2 days agoFour Missouri healthcare workers develop symptoms after bird flu exposureSkip to contentBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsUS ElectionSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthVideoLiveHomeNewsIsrael-Gaza WarWar in UkraineUS & CanadaUKUK PoliticsEnglandN.

A total of six healthcare workers have now developed symptoms after having contact with the patient, who is the first confirmed person to contract the disease with no known animal exposure.The patient has recovered, but the case is raising questions about potential human-to-human transmission of bird flu, which primarily affects animals. The only worker who was tested for the virus had negative results, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.That worker, who was given a PCR test for the virus, had what was considered high-risk contact with the patient and later developed mild symptoms.Another worker who had high-risk contact and three others who had low-risk contact were not tested during the time they experienced symptoms, according to the CDC."PCR testing would have been unreliable at the time of discovery of these individuals' prior symptoms," said the agency. PCR testing, which can give results quickly, was common during the Covid-19 pandemic.Along with the healthcare workers, one member of the patient's household developed symptoms, but also was not tested, according to the CDC.All of the healthcare workers with symptoms provided blood samples for antibody testing, as well as the household contact, the CDC said. The results of those tests remain unknown. Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is rare in humans. There have been 14 human cases of the viral disease in the US so far this year. Missouri's handling of the only one with no known animal exposure has come under scrutiny.Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told the health publication STAT that he was concerned about how long Missouri was taking to figure out who else may have been infected by the original patient. “Public health credibility is really on the line here,” Mr Osterholm said. The 13 other cases in 2024 involved farm workers who had links to bird flu outbreaks on dairy or poultry farms. The CDC continues to caution that the risk to the general public remains low. But bird flu cases among cows have been on the rise in the US this year. Since a March outbreak was first reported, cattle in 14 states have been affected, the CDC said.

Salwan Georges (The Washington Post/Getty)Nuño DomínguezSep 25, 2024 - 17:53CESTWhatsappFacebookTwitterLinkedinCopy linkAn experiment with cows in a high-security laboratory in the United States offers alarming data on the possibility of stopping the global bird flu epidemic, the worst recorded in history.American and German scientists experimentally infected calves and dairy cows in a level 3 security laboratory to determine the transmission route of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which is affecting animals on 231 farms in 14 U.S. states. The results confirm that the H5N1 virus accumulates in the udders and milk of cows, and is probably being transmitted by industrial milking systems.The authors of the paper warn that the H5N1 virus variant spreading in Europe is also capable of infecting dairy cows and making them sick. With a single jump of the virus from a wild bird to a farm animal, Europe could be in the same position as the U.S.The study comes just days after the U.S. Center for Disease Control reported that a second health worker had developed respiratory symptoms after caring for a patient who tested positive for H5N1 in the state of Missouri, but wasn’t tested for influenza. This is worrying since the Missouri patient is the only case who did not have contact with poultry or dairy cows. It is not known how they were infected.Fatality rate: 52%In 1996, an H5N1 virus from wild birds jumped to domestic geese in Asia. The spread of the pathogen led to the culling of 400 million chickens and other poultry, more than in the 36 previous epidemics recorded. According to the World Health Organization, 887 cases of infection in humans and 462 deaths have been detected since then, a fatality rate of 52%.In 2021, a new H5N1 subvariant known as 2.3.4.4b developed the ability to infect mammals, both wild and domestic, causing episodes of mass mortality. Since then, it has spread throughout Asia, Europe, America and Antarctica. The epicenter of the crisis is now in the United States, where this new avian flu in cows continues to spread on dairy farms.The new study, published in Nature, a leading source of world science, compared the infectivity of the H5N1 variant circulating in cattle in the United States by injecting viruses into the udders of dairy cows and the snouts of calves. The results show that animals infected via the respiratory route barely suffer symptoms and did not transmit the disease to other animals. Meanwhile, dairy cows infected via the udder did suffer severe illness, with high fever and lack of appetite, and their milk production plummeted.The study also infected dairy cows with a variant of H5N1 isolated from wild birds in Europe. The animals also became ill, showing that the American variant is not the only one capable of causing a large epidemic in cattle. The symptoms were so severe that some animals had to be euthanized early. Although the experiment cannot exactly reproduce the conditions found on farms, its results are consistent with the fatality rate of up to 5% of animals observed on livestock farms, the authors explain.The origin of this epidemic is probably a single jump of H5N1 from a wild bird to a cow late last year or early this year, the study says. The movement of cattle between states is believed to have been responsible for the spread of the virus, which circulated for weeks without being detected.Juergen Richt, a researcher at Kansas State University, where the study was conducted, told EL PAÍS: “Our experiments show that the virus spreads mainly through milking and probably through milking equipment.” “It seems that the replication of the virus in cows is limited to the mammary glands. It is worrying that H5N1 continues to be transmitted between dairy cows, because it may allow it to adapt even more,” he added.Mandatory tests and quarantinesThe big question is whether the spread of H5N1 can be stopped. Martin Beer from the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute in Germany, co-author of the study, believes: “Mandatory testing should be introduced to identify all affected farms, followed by individual testing, quarantine and isolation of infected animals.” “It would also help if all cows were tested before they were transported and hygiene measures were reinforced on farms,” he adds. At present, each state is following its own control protocols without any binding federal guidelines.Natalia Majó, a veterinary pathologist and director of the Animal Health Research Centre (IRTA-CRESA) in Barcelona, believes that “the situation is very worrying.” “In Europe, it seems that we are getting used to ignoring this news, partly because this year there has been very little expansion of avian flu. But this work shows us that the same thing can happen here as in the United States with a single introduction of the virus from a single infected bird. Surveillance is essential,” she says.For Elisa Pérez, a veterinary virologist at Spain’s CSIC Animal Health Research Center, she admits: “Just a few months ago I would have said that it was impossible for an avian virus to spread so quickly among mammals.”H5N1 has mutated to take advantage of the molecular receptors of the mammary glands and has already infected 59 species of mammals, including humans. The number of viral particles in cows’ milk is “about 100 million per milliliter, a very high amount,” warns the researcher. The expert assumes that calves are becoming infected by feeding. “Most infected people had conjunctivitis, probably due to splashes during milking,” she adds.For the scientist, the big question is why this crisis in livestock is only affecting the United States, especially now that it is known that this country’s variant is not the only one capable of making cows sick. “In Canada, for example, there has not been a single case. Nor in Europe. Perhaps it is due to some characteristic of the farms there that we have not yet identified, or to closer contact with infected birds, possibly through watering troughs,” she ventures.In any case, the researcher believes that “once such an epidemic has started, it is very difficult to stop.” “There needs to be a willingness to carry out mass surveillance,” she argues. When H5N1 infects a cow, its milk production drops by up to 90%, explains Pérez. This may be the best warning sign to detect an outbreak and stop it before it is too late.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

The FDA has approved the first self-administered flu vaccine that can be taken right at home. By: Dr. Partha Nandi Posted and last updated (WXYZ) — There’s good news for those who are short on time when it comes to getting a flu shot: the Food and Drug Administration has approved the first self-administered flu vaccine that can be taken right at home. This is great news, especially for people who are afraid of needles like young children.Now, the needle-free vaccine is the FluMist, which is made by AstraZeneca. It’s not a new vaccine; it’s been safely used for over 20 years. It just now has two FDA-approved options: in office or at home.FluMist is a live attenuated influenza vaccine, meaning it contains a weakened form of the flu virus. But it’s been changed, so it doesn’t cause illness in healthy people. It’s sprayed directly into the nose and helps the immune system recognize and fight off the flu virus without causing an infection.And while people won’t have to visit a doctor’s office to get the vaccine, a prescription will still be needed. Here’s how it’ll work. AstraZeneca plans to make it available through a third-party online pharmacy.Those interested will fill out a questionnaire that the pharmacy reviews. If the individual is eligible, the pharmacy will write the prescription, and the nasal spray will be shipped directly to the person’s home.But don’t expect this at-home option just yet. AstraZeneca says it expects the nasal spray will be ready for next year’s flu season.It’ll be available to healthy people between the ages of 2 to 49. For kids between 2 and 17, the nasal spray should be administered by a parent or caregiver.However, FluMist is not recommended for some groups, such as:People with weakened immune systemsPregnant peopleAnyone with severe allergies to the ingredients in the vaccine, except for egg proteinPeople who’ve had a severe reaction to any flu vaccine before andKids 2 years old to 4 years old with asthma or a history of wheezing in the past 12 monthsThere are other underlying health conditions, too, which is why the screening process is really important.As for side effects, the most common ones reported are fever in kids ages 2 through 6, a runny nose and nasal congestion in people 2 through 49, and a sore throat in adults.While the at-home version of FluMist won’t be out this year, doctor’s offices and pharmacies will still have the in-office version along with other vaccine options.I highly recommend getting the flu vaccine—it’s the best way to protect yourself. Last year alone, the flu led to around 35 million illnesses, 400,000 hospitalizations and 25,000 deaths. Copyright 2024 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

As the season has progressed, a growing number of outbreaks have been recorded in poultry flocks. So far, the number of outbreaks has been low, but presence of HPAI in wild birds has been followed in previous years by a spike in the disease on commercial farms across the continent and beyond. Recent outbreaks on poultry farms in 5 European statesSo far this year, 148 HPAI outbreaks have been recorded in commercial poultry in 14 countries of the region. This is according to the latest update of the Animal Disease Information System by the European Commission (EC; September 18), which monitors the animal disease situation member states of the European Union (EU) and selected adjacent countries. For comparison, the system logged a total of 521 HPAI outbreaks in this population across 24 countries during the whole of 2023.Since mid-August, France and Germany had each confirmed three outbreaks in poultry, and there has been an increase of one in the totals for the Czech Republic (Czechia), Denmark, and Poland. In all of these cases, the birds have tested positive for the H5N1 serotype of the virus. Multiple outbreaks confirmed in poultry in French, German regionsFurther details of the HPAI situation in each country is provided in notifications to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).Since early August, France has registered three outbreaks in poultry linked to the H5N1 virus variant (as of September 24). All occurred at farms in different departments, but all were in the northwestern region of Brittany (Bretagne). Directly affected in total have been around 6,500 commercial birds. Over the past week, three outbreaks involving the same virus serotype have been recorded in Germany. All were at commercial premises in the same district of the central-eastern state of Saxony Anhalt. Each with a mixed flock of between 34 and 118 birds — a total of 316 poultry. Following a five-month hiatus, the H5N1 HPAI virus has been detected again in the Czech Republic. In mid-September, around 50 geese died suddenly as a farm in the Central Bohemian region, according to the WOAH notification. From this source, it appears that there were 1,000 poultry at the farm — 700 geese and 300 hens — and that 848 of them have been culled to control the further spread of infection.In Denmark, the same virus serotype surfaced again in early September following an apparent absence of six months. Testing positive was a commercial flock comprising around 3,500 ducks and 2,800 hens in the Zealand region.The presence of the H5N1 serotype of the HPAI virus has been confirmed to WOAH for each of these outbreaks. Northwest Poland’s Lubusz province had been free of HPAI since the end of February until its presence was detected again at a farm with around 14,700 meat turkeys in late August, according to the nation’s chief veterinary office. New cases in captive birdsFor the year to date, the EC System has recorded a total of 48 HPAI outbreaks in Europe’s captive birds (backyards, zoos and similar premises). These have occurred in nine of the region’s states.Since mid-August, Spain and Portugal have confirmed their first cases in this category of the year, bringing the total number of countries affected to nine. In 2023, the same source registered a total of 99 outbreaks in captive birds in 15 European states. At the end of August, the Czech Republic’s first outbreak of the season in this category was confirmed in the southwestern region of Southern Bohemia. Affected was a backyard flock of eight birds. Subsequent to the latest EC update, the first ever HPAI infections linked to the H5N1 virus have been confirmed in the Nisporeni district in western Moldova. To date, outbreaks have been confirmed at six locations in a single village, according to WOAH notifications. Each involved a mixed flock of captive wild geese and domestic chickens. In central Ukraine, first cases of HPAI since March have been registered with WOAH in the province of Kirovohrad. Affected was a village flock of 128 domestic birds, which tested positive for the H5N1 virus variant during the past week. France to continue HPAI vaccination programSo far, around 54.8 million of the nation's poultry have received a dose of vaccine against HPAI, according to the French agriculture ministry (as of September 1). The highest numbers of birds receiving the vaccine have been in the western regions of Pays de la Loire (24.0 million), and Nouvelle Aquitaine (15.5 million). Financed by the state, the program began in October of last year, with the aim to vaccinate all commercial duck flocks nationwide. This poultry subgroup had been hit hardest by a series of HPAI outbreaks during recent years. The current phase of the campaign is scheduled to run until the end of this month, and to have cost around EUR96 million (US$107 million). At the end of August, the ministry reported agreement had been reached with poultry industry stakeholders over the division of costs for the next phase of the mandatory duck HPAI vaccination campaign (October to December of this year).Previously, the French state committed to covering 70% of the costs of the new campaign, which is scheduled to begin on October 1. Under the latest agreement, the French agriculture ministry will cover all costs relating to the purchase of the vaccine, its storage and transport, and supervision of vaccinations by a veterinarian. Furthermore, it will pay for monthly post-vaccination surveillance (to detect possible low-level virus circulation in apparently healthy birds), as well as sample analysis during active surveillance.Meanwhile, the poultry sector will be responsible for the costs of carrying out the vaccinations, and for weekly passive surveillance on any birds found sick or dead. According to the ministry, the French state has also covered compensation to the national poultry sector for HPAI outbreaks. This has cost more than EUR1 billion over the last three years. HPAI season begins for European wild birdsWhile few cases of wild birds testing positive for HPAI were reported across the region over the summer months, there has been a recent uptick in confirmed infections. According to the EC System, 435 outbreaks in this population were confirmed in 29 states so far this year (as of September 18). This represents an increase of just 19 outbreaks since mid-August, and compares with over 3,500 outbreaks in 30 countries during the whole of 2023. Based on notifications to WOAH from the national animal health agencies, first cases of the fall/autumn season have been confirmed in the wild bird populations of Austria, Croatia, Denmark, France, and Ukraine since mid-August. This also applies to the German states of Bavaria, Hamburg city, Hesse, and Saxony Anhalt. Further cases in ongoing disease outbreaks waves involving wild birds have been registered with WOAH by Belgium, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the German state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved at-home self- or caregiver-administration of FluMist (influenza vaccine live, intranasal). FluMist® is a nasally-administered influenza vaccine that is indicated for active immunization to prevent influenza disease in individuals 2 to 49 years of age. The approval for self-administration was supported by data from a usability study that showed individuals aged 18 years and older could self-administer FluMist or administer it to younger individuals without any additional guidance; 100% of the intended users had administered the full dose. For those interested in receiving FluMist at home, AstraZeneca plans to make the vaccine available through an online pharmacy. Individuals will need to complete a questionnaire that will be reviewed by a pharmacist. If eligible, the vaccine will be shipped to the person’s home for administration. For individuals 2 to 17 years of age, FluMist must be administered by a caregiver. “Today’s approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families,” said Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. According to AstraZeneca, FluMist will continue to be available for administration by a health care provider in physician offices and pharmacies.

Rob Coker | 09/26/2024 | News AstraZeneca’s FluMist has been approved by the FDA as the first self-administered vaccine for the prevention of influenza. Through administration directly into the nose, FluMist has been FDA-approved since 2003 for use in adults and children over the age of five; in 2007, the approval was extended to include children down to two years of age.Administration previously had to be carried out by a healthcare practitioner, but the latest approval clears the vaccine for self administration in adults up to the age of 49 (for children aged 2 to 17 years, the vaccine must be administered by a parent or caregiver). According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, flu is estimated to have resulted in between 4,900 and 51,000 deaths each year since 2010 (1).AstraZeneca plans to make the vaccine available online. Purchasers must complete a screening and eligibility assessment when they order. The vaccine will also continue to be available in offices and pharmacies for administration by healthcare professionals.Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement: “Today’s approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families. Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza.” Vaccination rates have been falling in the US in recent years. According to AstraZeneca, surveys have shown that at-home vaccination options may be able to boost uptake.During the 2016/2017 flu season, the US CDC recommended not to use FluMist, citing “data showing poor or relatively lower effectiveness” (2). With the industry giant forced to rethink and reformulate the product, a CDC recommendation returned in 2018 (3).With the perseverance of the industry in increasing access to treatments that protect patients from annual illnesses resulting in the first at-home vaccine delivery method, could we see other vaccines added to the list in the near future?

Bukaty/AP By Ranu Dhillon, Abraar Karan, and Devabhaktuni Srikrishna Sept. 27, 2024 Dhillon is an instructor in the Division of Global Health Equity at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Karan is an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at Stanford University. Srikrishna is founder of Patient Knowhow. Despite no known infections of H5N1 bird flu among its dairy cows, Missouri recently detected a case in a person with no apparent exposure to possibly infected animals or related products (i.e., raw milk). A close contact and two health workers who cared for the person all developed respiratory symptoms, but were never tested. There has not yet been a wider uptick of other potential cases in the same community to indicate efficient human-to-human transmission — the evolution of which is a prerequisite for a possible human epidemic — but this scare underscores the potential danger posed by the ongoing spread of H5N1. In recent weeks, California, home to the largest number of dairy cows in the country, became the 14th state to report infected herds. It is possible that H5N1 may be even more widespread, including in states without reported infections among dairy cows, but a lack of testing has made it difficult to know where the virus is circulating. This bottleneck could be resolved by sampling wastewater as close to dairy farms as possible and using genomic sequencing to confirm the presence of H5N1. Sequencing could also assess any detected virus for mutations possibly conducive for human transmission and enable phylogenetic analyses that can help determine from which species it may have originated. The more H5N1 is allowed to circulate, especially among dairy cows that are clustered closely together in large numbers and with close human contact, the greater the chance the virus could evolve for efficient human spread.advertisement Several months into this outbreak, on-farm testing has remained limited. Farm owners remain reluctant to allow testing of bulk milk and animals due to fears of financial loss. Farm workers, many of whom are undocumented, have also been hesitant to get tested due to concerns of losing work, immigration issues, and, in some instances, being unaware that there is an outbreak. After nine poultry workers were infected in July, Colorado mandated routine testing of bulk milk on all dairy farms. This policy quickly led to the detection of 11 infected herds. Colorado required these herds to remain isolated until subsequent testing confirms that viral circulation is no longer present. Massachusetts is the only other state to test all its dairy herds. Other states have not pursued similar directives presumably due to opposition from farm owners and the dairy industry. Colorado’s approach could be mimicked without mandates by sampling wastewater as close to farms as possible and sequencing it for H5N1. Wastewater is already being tested from about 150 sites for the H5 hemagglutinin gene of the influenza virus, though this approach does not distinguish the neuraminidase (“N”) subtype. Sequencing could be used to delineate the N subtype as well as monitor for several mutations that virologists have identified as potentially necessary for efficient human-to-human transmission. The presence of these mutations could trigger more intensive measures in affected areas, such as testing, vaccination and ensuring workers have personal protective equipment. Related Story Preparing schools for the H5N1 bird flu they’re likely to face The value of a sequencing-based approach was demonstrated by a team from the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute (TEPHI). In a recent letter in the New England Journal of Medicine, they report on a two-year, 10-city proof-of-concept for a technique that they first described in 2023 (and which won the 2024 STAT Madness contest). Their approach searches for and enriches nearly 100 viruses of “public health concern” in wastewater samples with sequencing conducted on detected viral fragments. The researchers began using this approach in May 2022 and found no trace of H5N1 for nearly two years. Then, in March 2024, they began to see it across 10 Texas cities. Sequencing showed the virus to be from the clade circulating among dairy cows, but did not detect a mutation adaptive for human transmission, consistent with animals as the source.advertisement This type of approach, if decentralized closer to farms and scaled to urban centers, could provide nationwide visibility into H5N1’s geographic distribution and genomic evolution and help get a handle on transmission. Whenever H5N1 is found in a location, the farms in the area could be either mandated or requested to allow on-farm testing with no movement of cattle permitted until they are cleared of ongoing circulation. Sequencing could also be done in other areas where H5N1 may be circulating, like Missouri, or whose wastewater is found positive for H5 influenza without clear links to animal sources, such as in the San Francisco Bay Area. There are four things needed to apply this strategy. First, a protocol for sequencing should be decided upon or developed for scale. The TEPHI approach is one proven option. At first glance, agnostically sequencing for almost 100 pathogens may be overkill for the purposes of tracking H5N1. It is conceivable that this technique could be adapted into a less expansive approach that augments current H5 wastewater surveillance and only sequences samples found positive. Efforts to create a pared-down protocol of this kind could be pursued, but has not taken place at any level of scale to our knowledge and would need to be validated before wider use, which could take months and require substantial funding to complete. Given the urgency of the current outbreak, it may be more efficient to license and scale the TEPHI protocol that has already been validated in peer-reviewed journals and piloted at scale for two years. Second, state and county officials should identify sites from which wastewater should be sampled based on the distribution and location of dairy farms and communities with suspected H5N1. This selection should aim to get adequate coverage and, yet, be disaggregated enough to enable sufficiently localized follow-up and control efforts. Third, this technique would likely cost substantially more than conventional wastewater testing, including initial capital investments for sequencing equipment and bioinformatic computing and recurring costs for reagents, software licenses and trained personnel. The required outlays could be quantified and funds sought from federal and state budgets. Even while awaiting allocations, currently available funds could immediately be targeted to the most strategic sites with others added as more resources become available.advertisement Related Story Getting farmworkers to use PPE is hard, but it’s the best way to stop an H5N1 bird flu epidemic Fourth, the limitations of wastewater sequencing need to be better understood to inform how its results could best be used to guide public health response. For example, it is unclear how much virus needs to be shed into the wastewater in order for this technique to reliably detect it. If low-grade transmission is not readily found, persistent viral circulation could elude control efforts only to surge later. It is also unclear how consistently waste from dairy cows is flushed into routine wastewater as opposed to being discarded separately. These parameters need to be clarified so strategies can be appropriately planned. In the absence of mandates for on-farm testing, even with imperfect sensitivity, wastewater sequencing may be the best — and only — way to track and stifle the dairy outbreak. Officials in Missouri are pursuing serological testing of the health workers and close contact, which may indicate if human-to-human transmission of H5N1 has already happened. Regardless of the outcome, the lack of a wider footprint of potential cases suggests that it may not yet be efficient enough to cause an epidemic. However, the longer the dairy outbreak is allowed to persist, the higher the odds that such a human transmissible strain may emerge. This current scare should wake us up to finally act more aggressively and creatively in addressing this threat. Ranu S.

The CDC said the two fairgoers are under the age of 18 and sought health care in early September. One patient is said to have had direct contact with pigs while the other had indirect contact. Neither of them had been in contact with one another at the fair. The Minnesota Department of Health does not anticipate further spread, MDH epidemiologist Melissa McMahon said. “Typically, humans don’t pass it to another human in the way that they would a normal human flu strain,” McMahon said.

It can be mild to severe, but it’s not symptomatically, or in terms of severity, all that different from human flu,” McMahon said. She said infection does not only occur through close or direct contact, but it can occur when touching surfaces that pigs have been in contact with. McMahon and the Minnesota Department of Health encourage people to wash their hands after visiting agricultural farms or events and to maintain distance from the animals. Both fairgoers have recovered from their symptoms and were not hospitalized. The CDC reported that nine other variants of influenza have been reported during the 2023-2024 season.

Getting vaccinated against flu before the peak winter season seems an obvious example, yet for far too many Hongkongers it remains a step too often delayed.AdvertisementSo, it would be wise to heed the timely advice of the Hospital Authority, which has launched its seasonal influenza vaccination programmes.With flu cases expected to rise as temperatures dip, special outreach projects are targeting schools and residential care homes. There is also a push this year to get more toddlers vaccinated.Many venues around the city offer seasonal flu jabs, including 16 district health centres.

The time is now, doctors sayMichaela Ramm Des Moines RegisterShow Caption Hide Caption FDA: COVID-19 vaccines are updated and approved ahead of fall seasonThe FDA announced that the latest update of the COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer are approved and ready for fall.Cooler temperatures are expected in Iowa soon, and with it, another season of respiratory viral illnesses.The time for the cold-weather spread of COVID-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is quickly approaching. With it comes a new wave of illnesses that can result in school absences, busy urgent care clinics and even increased hospitalizations.That means ― it's time to get your fall shots.Federal health officials have approved new vaccines for the 2024-25 fall and winter season that can help prevent serious infection from these three major respiratory viruses. However, sufficiently high vaccination rates will be a key factor in how this viral season plays out in Iowa."Don’t wait until it's too late. Start vaccinating yourself, and encouraging your family and friends to do so, in September or October," said Dr. Aneesa Afroze, infectious disease specialist at MercyOne Medical Center in Des Moines. "October is usually when we start seeing that respiratory illness kick in, so the sooner the better to protect yourself.”How bad will the respiratory illness season be this year?The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts this year's respiratory illness season will be similar to last year's, with similar or lower hospitalization rates from respiratory virus infections.Last year, more than 900,000 people were hospitalized and more than 75,000 individuals died from a COVID-19 infection, according to the CDC. In addition, nearly 45,000 individuals died due to complications from the flu.Should I get vaccinated?Vaccines are an important tool to prevent hospitalizations, especially among populations most vulnerable to serious infections, said Dr. Nathan Boonstra, pediatrician at Blank Children’s Hospital in Des Moines.It's also important that healthy people seek out the shots, he said. Not only can it help their symptoms if they are infected, but it will also help reduce the spread of the virus to others.“There’s not a lot of reason not to,” said Boonstra, who is also the chair of the Iowa Immunizes Coalition. “The vaccines are safe. Besides a sore arm and maybe a fever, there’s not a lot of reason to not go ahead and get your flu and COVID vaccines when they are available.”Here's everything you need to know about annual vaccines:What's the latest on the updated COVID-19 vaccines?The CDC recommends everyone ages 6 months and older receive the latest COVID-19 shot this year.Doses of the updated COVID-19 vaccines are now available at clinics, retail pharmacies and other health care facilities across the state.New updated shots developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month, have been reformulated to target the KP.2 strain of COVID-19.KP.2 is a descendant of the JN.1 variant that has been spreading across the U.S. in recent months, resulting in a summer surge of new infections. Both of these strains are descendants of the Omicron strain.In addition, a shot developed by Novavax was approved by federal health officials for anyone ages 12 years and older. This shot targets the JN.1 strain, which has also been tied to other strains currently circulating.What's the latest on COVID-19 infections?COVID-19 activity had been on the rise in Iowa in recent months, following a national trend of increased infections across the U.S.New state public health data shows new coronavirus infections are starting to decline in Iowa. As of Sept. 7, the most recent report available from Iowa public health officials, the rate of positive COVID-19 tests reached 19.5%. That’s compared to the more than 25% positivity rate reported in early August.However, total infections are still far below case counts reported early in the pandemic.Boonstra said he's seeing multiple young patients test positive for COVID-19 each week. Because of this, he recommends all of his pediatric patients receive the updated coronavirus vaccine.“Even though kids are certainly lower risk in general than older people, it still is shown in the literature that if you're vaccinated during the season and you get COVID, you're going to be less likely to have bad outcomes than if you were unvaccinated," he said.Should patients get a flu shot at the same time as the COVID-19 vaccine?The latest influenza vaccine is also available in pharmacies and clinics across Iowa. Some retail pharmacies are offering shots without an appointment.The seasonal flu shot is recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older.All flu vaccines approved for the 2024-2025 season are trivalent vaccines, or vaccines that are formulated to protect against three different flu viruses, according to the CDC.Afroze is encouraging patients to get this year's flu shot at the same time as the new updated COVID-19 vaccines. Again, she emphasized the best time to get these shots is September and October.Are Iowans keeping up with vaccinations?Even as local health care providers are encouraging their patients to seek out the latest seasonal shots, many are grappling with a lack of enthusiasm in recent years about the newest vaccines.Only about 22% of people nationwide received the latest COVID-19 vaccine during the 2023-24 season, according to the CDC. That rate was even worse in Iowa, with only 15.7% of Iowans statewide receiving the new COVID-19 shot last respiratory season.Nationwide, 47% of all adults had the flu vaccine by the end of last season, which was similar to the previous respiratory season. In Iowa, only about 34% of the state's population received a flu shot during last year's season.Afroze said uptake of the influenza vaccine has historically been low, even before the pandemic. She also said vaccine fatigue could be contributing to the low interest in new COVID-19 shots, particularly after the multiple rounds of recommended booster shots in the pandemic.“I think we just have to keep pushing for and encouraging people to take it,” Afroze said. “Although many people get the disease and get better, those handful of people who really get sick can’t be ignored. More than a million people have died, and you can’t ignore that fact.”What new treatments are available for RSV?Last year, federal health officials approved new tools to protect against RSV, another type of respiratory virus, which can be deadly for young babies and older individuals. In all, federal health officials have approved three types of RSV vaccines.Adults age 75 and older should receive an RSV vaccine, as well as adults age 60-74 years who have an increased risk due to certain chronic conditions, such as lung or heart disease.CDC officials also recommend those who are pregnant in their third trimester receive an RSV vaccine to protect their newborns from RSV infection. The shot is approved for use between the 32nd and 36th week of pregnancy during RSV season, which typically runs September through January.What are monoclonal antibody treatments?In addition, federal health officials have also approved monoclonal antibody treatments for babies and some infants most at risk to severe illness from an RSV infection.These treatment are recommended for all babies age 8 months or younger whose mothers did not receive the maternal vaccine during pregnancy. In addition, children age 8-19 months who have an increased risk for severe illness should receive a dose before their second RSV season, according to federal health officials.Boonstra said these tools are a big help to health care providers as they work to keep their patients healthy during RSV season.“The fact that we have this monoclonal antibody as a tool that can protect babies, especially high-risk babies, during our season, that's fantastic for us," Boonstra said.However, Boonstra said local health care facilities had only a limited supply of monoclonal antibody treatments last year, creating challenges in their ability to ensure all patients who qualified could receive that care.“It was very challenging. We had to really be careful about the doses that we had, and we tried to reserve them for the highest-risk kids," Boonstra said. "But that was really a challenging thing, because we wanted to be able to give to everybody.”Boonstra said it's still unclear what the supply of RSV antibodies will look like this year, since local health care facilities are still waiting for those shipments. He encouraged parents to contact their doctor's office if they have any questions.What about other strategies to stay healthy?Local health care providers encourage individuals to still take other precautions during the upcoming respiratory viral season. That includes washing your hands frequently, wearing masks and staying away from others when experiencing certain symptoms, such as coughing or sneezing.While all of these steps are important, local doctors saying getting the vaccines against these respiratory viruses are the best steps individuals can take to stay healthy and to protect those around them from serious illness.“When we talk about preventing flu and COVID, there’s nothing better than being immunized against those viruses," Boonstra said. "Other things help, but it’s always better to have that extra support on board too.”Michaela Ramm covers health care for the Des Moines Register.

We’ve faced numerous ones in history that tested human resilience. And now, we gear up once again to face another looming threat – the H5N1 bird flu virus. We have a relentless foe hiding in our midst, spreading unseen and silently evolving. A recent study published in the journal Nature has cast a spotlight on the H5N1 virus.From European fur farms to United States dairy cattle, H5N1 seems to be leaving no stone unturned. But the burning question is – will bird flu cause the next human pandemic?Evolutionary pathways of bird fluZoonotic influenza specialist Dr. Thomas Peacock and his team from The Pirbright Institute have investigated the complex world of virus ecology and evolution.Dr Peacock, who analyzed the drivers of the current H5N1 avian influenza panzootic, noted that influenza A viruses (IAV) have caused more documented global pandemics in human history than any other pathogen.“Historically, swine are considered optimal intermediary hosts that help avian influenza viruses adapt to mammals before jumping to humans,” said Dr. Peacock. “However, the altered ecology of H5N1 has opened the door to new evolutionary pathways.”The sudden expansion of bird fluThe researchers have identified the “altered ecology” of H5N1 as a key driver in its spread. This particular bird flu virus strain is proving to be a formidable enemy, continually evolving and finding novel ways to infiltrate and infect hosts.“Could dairy cattle, farmed mink, or South American sea lions serve as new mammalian gateways to humans? Here we explore the molecular and ecological factors driving H5N1’s sudden expansion in host range and assess the likelihood of different zoonotic pathways leading to an H5N1 pandemic,” noted the researchers.Major gaps in our defense The study reveals weak spots in our current control mechanisms. An apparent hesitation to adopt modern vaccine and surveillance technologies, combined with a lack of consistent data collection around H5N1 transmission between cows and humans on US dairy farms, are causing major gaps in our defenses.While previous generations of US cattle producers had successfully stamped out foot-and-mouth disease by rapidly sharing epidemiological data, the current scenario seems to have slipped into a data blackout. Unprecedented gaps in data are leaving researchers, veterinarians, and policy-makers grappling in the dark.While H5N1 is a reportable disease in poultry, it does not hold the same status in mammals in the US. The Department of Agriculture mandates H5N1 testing only in lactating cattle before interstate movement.Silent spreaders of the bird flu virusThe current focus for H5N1 monitoring in wildlife is carcass testing, which provides a perfect bypass for the virus to spread silently and undetected among live animals.So, we are left with a chilling possibility – unseen chains of transmission silently spreading through various avenues.A process called “genomic reassortment” plays a major role in the current global spread. When two or more viruses infect a host at the same time, they can exchange segments during genome replication, creating novel hybrid viruses.Turning point for HPAIThe possible continual presence of H5N1 in Europe and the Americas is a significant turning point for High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI). We need to rapidly develop new control strategies, including vaccination.Stocks of H5 vaccines that are antigenically related to circulating viruses are available and could be scaled up using mRNA platforms for mass production if H5N1 begins spreading in humans.Bird flu’s threat to humansThe potential severity of an H5N1 pandemic remains unclear. However, recent bird flu infections in humans have shown a lower case fatality rate compared to previous outbreaks in Asia. This could be due to infection through the eye, instead of viral pneumonia in the lungs.Older individuals seem to have partial immunity due to prior exposure, while younger individuals may be more susceptible to severe disease in a future H5N1 pandemic.As we stand at the precipice of a possible new pandemic, it’s time for us to buckle up and tighten our defenses against the H5N1 bird flu virus. We must ask ourselves a crucial question – Are we ready to combat another pandemic?The study is published in the journal Nature.—–Like what you read?

It’s currently available in pharmacies and other health care settings for people ages 2 to 49 who have a prescription.Friday’s approval from the FDA adds a second option for those eligible to receive the vaccine: It can be taken at home, through self-administration by adults or to children with the help of a caregiver.AstraZeneca plans to make the vaccine available for self-administration through a third-party online pharmacy, which will prescribe and ship the vaccine after reviewing a screening and eligibility assessment. It expects this option to be available in time for the start of next year’s respiratory virus season.“Today’s approval of the first influenza vaccine for self- or caregiver-administration provides a new option for receiving a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine potentially with greater convenience, flexibility and accessibility for individuals and families,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.“Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the U.S. population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death,” he said. “This approval adds another option for vaccination against influenza disease and demonstrates the FDA’s commitment to advancing public health.”The flu caused at least 35 million illnesses, 400,000 hospitalizations and 25,000 deaths in the 2023-24 season, according to estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recommends vaccination for everyone ages 6 months and older each season. But uptake has fallen in recent years; last season, only about half of adults and children got their annual flu vaccine.FluMist is the only needle-free option available for flu vaccination in the US. It uses a live, weakened version of the influenza virus to provide protection, but injectable versions use different technology: either killed viruses or proteins to train the immune system to fight off the virus. AstraZeneca says FluMist has been shown to be as effective as other flu vaccines.When the FDA announced last year that it was reviewing the possibility of a self-administered flu vaccine, physicians told CNN that they welcomed more accessible options but didn’t expect that self-administration would change vaccination rates significantly.Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health and the former White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said at the time that a self-administered flu vaccine option could be even more accessible if it were available to buy on pharmacy shelves, rather than through a gatekeeper.But he noted as many as 10% to 15% of people may be needle-phobic and hesitant to get vaccines, so increasing ways to access a needle-free version could boost uptake.“I think the impact is going to be modest,” he said of the possibility. But he said he hoped it to would lead to increased awareness, potentially through more marketing from AstraZeneca, or more research into additional intranasal vaccines that are easier to get. “I see this as a relatively positive step.” Back-to-back storm events brought record storm surge, rainfall and winds to the Tampa Bay region.

This year's deadline to upload proof of receiving the vaccine is Friday, Nov. 15. Community messages were sent Friday to university faculty and staff by Executive Vice Provost Stephen Gange and Interim Vice President of Human Resources Meredith Stewart, and to students by Vice Provost for Student Health and Well-Being Kevin Shollenberger and Chief Medical Director for Student Health and Well-Being Roanna Kessler. "A flu vaccination remains the best way to protect against infection and reduce disease severity," the administrators wrote. "Receiving a flu shot before the end of October offers optimal protection during the respiratory virus season." The requirement for the 2024-25 academic year extends a mandate that has been in place since 2020. The mandate applies to those who are working or studying in-person on a JHU campus; it does not apply to affiliates who are 100% remote—that is, those who never visit any Johns Hopkins facility or conduct business in any public setting on Johns Hopkins' behalf. Johns Hopkins Medicine and Applied Physics Laboratory employees are subject to their respective policies and procedures. School of Medicine affiliates follow JHM policies and procedures. Instructions for uploading proof of vaccination vary by school and affiliation, as well as a list of upcoming clinics at Hopkins locations, are posted at the university's mandatory flu vaccine webpage. Where to get a flu shot On-site clinics: The flu vaccine will be available to students and employees at a series of on-site JHU clinics listed on the mandatory vaccine flu policy webpage. Affiliates attending walk-in clinics should complete the required form in advance and bring it with them along with their JHU identification. Occupational Health clinics at Homewood campus and East Baltimore. Please bring your Hopkins ID. Walgreens: JHU faculty and staff can get the flu vaccination for free at any Walgreens location using the JHU flu vaccine voucher, available at the Vaccine Management System (VMS). Walgreens clinics will automatically upload your proof of vaccination to the VMS. Pharmacies and doctor's offices: Affiliates can get vaccinated at local pharmacy or by their primary care physician; a co-pay may apply to your provider visit. Proof of vaccination If you receive the flu vaccine anywhere other than at a JHU-sponsored vaccine clinic or at Walgreens with your flu voucher, you must provide proof of immunization. This applies even if the doctor/doctor's office that gave you the vaccine is within the Johns Hopkins network. At a minimum, the submission should include a clear scan or photo of a record that includes your name, the date of vaccination, and the vaccination location (e.g., Giant, CVS, or the name of the physician's office). If you didn't get a receipt and you got your vaccine in Maryland, you can download proof of your flu shot from the Maryland myIR.com website. Exceptions Anyone requesting a religious or medical exception to the flu vaccine must submit their request by Thursday, Oct. 31. There is no need to reapply if you had a religious exception approved last year. For more information, university affiliates should visit the mandatory flu vaccine website; Johns Hopkins Medicine affiliates should visit the flu campaign website.

Figures from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Service (APHIS) show that in 2023, no cases of HPAI were confirmed between April 9 and October 4. Two commercial poultry farms had confirmed cases of HPAI on October 6, and before October was over, the United States had 25 commercial flocks struck by HPAI, followed by 57 commercial flocks in November and 45 commercial flocks in December.Pittman said it is also worth knowing that while HPAI is not presently considered endemic in poultry, it is in wild birds, “which means it’s regularly occurring and typically present, so you should assume that a wild bird could be carrying avian influenza at this point.”Avoid ‘crisis fatigue’With the fall migration undoubtedly coming, and a billion-bird migration night possibly coming, it is particularly important to make sure all people working on or with your facility are trained on and practicing good biosecurity.“I know that we are all possibly experiencing crisis fatigue. This disease is not good for anybody, especially not birds, responders and growers,” she said.And while all poultry farms need to be training people on biosecurity, Pittman said it is especially important with the poultry complexes that have a high employee turnover rate. She emphasized that personnel not only need to be educated on what to do, but why it needs to be done.“When we explain why we are doing things, there’s much higher level of compliance,” she said.It’s OK to be ‘weird’ about biosecurityOne of the biggest risks to the well-being of poultry could be trespassers.Pittman recommends using gates, locks and even cameras to control the situation. She also says there is nothing wrong with doing what some people might think is going overboard.“Be weird. If someone’s on your property that’s not supposed to be there, call the cops. Ask them what they’re doing,” she said.Recently in Georgia, Pittman said, there was a situation in which a truck that was haling a trailer of birds pulled up to a commercial poultry farm that was not far off the road. It is known that the trespasser at minimum poked his or her head (she did not identify the trespasser’s gender) into at least one poultry house. Fortunately, she said, a service technician was onsite and authorities were called. View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

Published Sept. 25, 2024 By Nick Paul Taylor Contributor post share post print email license Roche’s temperature-activated generation of signal technology (TAGS) allows labs to detect up to 12 respiratory viruses at once. Courtesy of Roche Dive Brief: Roche launched the first test using the company’s technology to simultaneously detect up to 12 respiratory viruses. The launch, announced Tuesday, enables users of Roche’s Cobas 5800, 6800 and 8800 molecular diagnostic analyzers to test for pathogens including influenza A and B, RSV and the COVID-19 virus. The test is available for labs in countries that accept CE marks. Roche plans to file for 510(k) clearance in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. The company is targeting a respiratory molecular diagnostics market that it has predicted will be worth 1.7 billion Swiss francs by 2027, the equivalent of about $2 billion according to Wednesday’s exchange rate. Dive Insight: Roche made the prediction at a diagnostics investor event in May. The company used the event to share details of its temperature-activated generation of signal technology, called TAGS. A single PCR test can typically detect up to five targets, four viruses and one control, according to Roche, with each target represented by one color. The TAGS technology allows users to measure three targets in the same color, visible at different temperatures, for up to 15 total targets. Nico Michel, Roche’s lifecycle leader infectious diseases for molecular lab, set out the benefits of the test and the pricing strategy at the May investor event. “With this first TAGS assay ... we make respiratory infection testing fully automated, and we enable our customers to easily scale and tackle seasonal high demand. We are also introducing an innovative pricing strategy with the possibility to order flexibly and use digital reflexing in a cost-efficient approach,” Michel said. Roche shared more details of “digital reflexing” in its press release about the launch. The company said clinicians can specify which pathogens to check for, choosing, for example, to use the test to determine if an adult patient has influenza or COVID-19 in the winter months when those particular respiratory viruses are prevalent. Typically, such targeted testing can delay diagnosis if follow-up tests are needed. Digital reflex removes that delay, Roche said, “by enabling the generation of additional results instantly or within seconds and without having to collect another sample or to run the existing sample again.” Multiple countries have initiated local registrations of the respiratory test. Roche plans to file for clearance with the Food and Drug Administration as the next big item on its regulatory roadmap. The company identified the test at its diagnostic day as a product that will boost growth. The launch of the respiratory test is part of a broader push to use the TAGS technology to enable flexible syndromic testing. Michel said the newly launched test is “the first of several future assays” based on the technology.

CSL Seqirus, a Global Leader in Pandemic Preparedness, Announces Fifth BARDA Award in Response to Avian Influenza Outbreak Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary English French German Italian Korean Spanish CSL Seqirus, a business of CSL (ASX: CSL), has received a $121.4 million multi-year award from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to expand its Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) program for MF59® adjuvant. This marks the fifth avian influenza pandemic preparedness award for CSL Seqirus. The expanded program will increase the inventory to 40 million equivalent doses, enhancing the U.S. government's pandemic preparedness efforts.MF59® adjuvant, manufactured at CSL Seqirus' Holly Springs, North Carolina facility, is important for pandemic preparedness as it reduces the antigen required to produce an immune response, thereby increasing vaccine doses. This expansion comes in response to sustained highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) activity, which the CDC reports is widespread in wild birds and causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows. CSL Seqirus, un'azienda di CSL (ASX: CSL), ha ricevuto un premio pluriennale da 121,4 milioni di dollari dalla Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) per espandere il proprio programma di Vendita Gestita da Fornitori (VMI) per l'adjuvante MF59®. Questo segna il quinto premio per la preparazione alla pandemia di influenza aviare per CSL Seqirus. Il programma espanso aumenterà l'inventario a 40 milioni di dosi equivalenti, migliorando gli sforzi di preparazione alla pandemia del governo degli Stati Uniti.L'adjuvante MF59®, prodotto presso lo stabilimento di CSL Seqirus a Holly Springs, Carolina del Nord, è importante per la preparazione alla pandemia in quanto riduce l'antigene necessario per produrre una risposta immunitaria, aumentando così le dosi di vaccino. Questa espansione è una risposta all'attività sostenuta di influenza aviare altamente patogena (HPAI), che i CDC riportano essere diffusa tra gli uccelli selvatici e causante focolai tra il pollame e le mucche da latte negli Stati Uniti. CSL Seqirus, una empresa de CSL (ASX: CSL), ha recibido un premio multianual de 121,4 millones de dólares de la Autoridad de Investigación y Desarrollo Avanzado Biomédico (BARDA) para expandir su programa de Inventario Gestionado por Proveedores (VMI) para el adyuvante MF59®. Este es el quinto premio para la preparación contra la pandemia de influenza aviar para CSL Seqirus. El programa expandido aumentará el inventario a 40 millones de dosis equivalentes, mejorando los esfuerzos de preparación para pandemias del gobierno de los Estados Unidos.El adyuvante MF59®, fabricado en la planta de CSL Seqirus en Holly Springs, Carolina del Norte, es importante para la preparación ante pandemias, ya que reduce el antígeno necesario para producir una respuesta inmunitaria, aumentando así las dosis de vacunas. Esta expansión es una respuesta a la actividad sostenida de la influenza aviar altamente patógena (HPAI), que los CDC informan está generalizada en aves silvestres y causando brotes en aves de corral y vacas lecheras en los EE. UU. CSL Seqirus는 CSL(ASX: CSL)의 사업으로, 1억 2,140만 달러의 다년 계약을 생물의학 고급 연구 및 개발 권한(BARDA)으로부터 받아 MF59® 보조제에 대한 공급자 관리 재고(VMI) 프로그램을 확장합니다. 이는 CSL Seqirus에 대한 다섯 번째 조류 인플루엔자 팬데믹 대비 보조금입니다. 확대된 프로그램은 재고를 4천만 개 동등 용량으로 늘려 미국 정부의 팬데믹 대비 노력을 강화할 것입니다.MF59® 보조제는 CSL Seqirus의 노스캐롤라이나 홀리 스프링스 시설에서 제조되며, 면역 반응을 생성하는 데 필요한 항원을 줄여 백신 용량을 늘이기 때문에 팬데믹 대비에 중요합니다. 이 확장은 CDC가 보고하는 바와 같이, 야생 조류에서 광범위하게 발생하고 가금류 및 미국 유제품의 발병을 초래하는 고병원성 조류 인플루엔자(HPAI) 활동에 대한 대응으로 이루어집니다. CSL Seqirus, une entreprise de CSL (ASX: CSL), a reçu un contrat pluriannuel de 121,4 millions de dollars de la Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) pour étendre son programme d'Inventaire Gérér par les Fournisseurs (VMI) pour l'adjuvant MF59®. Cela marque la cinquième subvention pour la préparation à la pandémie de grippe aviaire pour CSL Seqirus. Le programme élargi augmentera l'inventaire à 40 millions de doses équivalentes, renforçant ainsi les efforts de préparation à la pandémie du gouvernement des États-Unis.L'adjuvant MF59®, fabriqué dans l'établissement de CSL Seqirus à Holly Springs, Caroline du Nord, est essentiel pour la préparation à la pandémie car il réduit l'antigène nécessaire pour produire une réponse immunitaire, augmentant ainsi les doses de vaccin. Cette expansion intervient en réponse à l'activité soutenue de la grippe aviaire hautement pathogène (HPAI), qui, selon les CDC, est répandue chez les oiseaux sauvages et cause des épidémies chez les volailles et les vaches laitières aux États-Unis. CSL Seqirus, ein Unternehmen von CSL (ASX: CSL), hat einen Multijahresvertrag über 121,4 Millionen Dollar von der Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) erhalten, um sein Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) Programm für den MF59® Adjuvans auszubauen. Dies ist die fünfte Auszeichnung zur Pandemievorbereitung gegen Vogelgrippe für CSL Seqirus. Das erweiterte Programm wird den Bestand auf 40 Millionen äquivalente Dosen erhöhen und die Pandemievorbereitungsmaßnahmen der US-Regierung verstärken.Der MF59® Adjuvans, der in der Anlage von CSL Seqirus in Holly Springs, North Carolina, hergestellt wird, ist wichtig für die Pandemievorbereitung, da er die für die Herstellung einer Immunantwort erforderliche Antigenmenge reduziert, wodurch die Impfstoffdosen erhöht werden. Diese Erweiterung erfolgt als Reaktion auf die anhaltende Aktivität von hochpathogener Vogelgrippe (HPAI), die laut den CDC weit verbreitet bei Wildvögeln vorkommt und Ausbrüche bei Geflügel und Milchkühen in den USA verursacht. Positive Secured a $121.4 million multi-year award from BARDA Expanding MF59® adjuvant inventory to 40 million equivalent doses Fifth avian influenza pandemic preparedness award received Strengthening public-private partnership with U.S. government Negative None. 09/25/2024 - 04:30 PM Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and CSL Seqirus will expand their reserves of MF59® adjuvant to the equivalent of 40 million doses as part of the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS). The multi-year $121.4 million award from BARDA is the fifth avian influenza pandemic preparedness award for CSL Seqirus.SUMMIT, N.J., Sept. 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CSL Seqirus, a business of CSL (ASX: CSL), announced today that through its public-private partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the company will expand its Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) program for its proprietary MF59® adjuvant. This decision will further support the U.S. government's pandemic preparedness efforts. MF59® adjuvant is an important part of pandemic preparedness planning as it reduces the amount of antigen required to produce an immune response, increasing the number of vaccine doses.1,2 When combined with influenza antigens in a vaccine, MF59® adjuvant is designed to enhance and broaden the body's immune response by creating a broad, cross-reactive antibody response.3,4,5 "Once again, we're honored to partner with BARDA on pandemic preparedness," said Marc Lacey, CSL Seqirus, Global Executive Director for Pandemic. "This expanded program will increase outbreak resilience and help to protect against threats such as avian influenza." Under the terms of the $121.4 million multi-year award, CSL Seqirus will deliver MF59® adjuvant to increase the inventory of the VMI program to 40 million equivalent doses. MF59® will be manufactured at CSL Seqirus' Holly Springs, North Carolina facility, which was built under a long-term public-private partnership with BARDA to provide domestic influenza pandemic preparedness. MF59® from the VMI program can be used to manufacture vaccines to protect against the threat of avian and other strains of influenza. This is the fifth award CSL Seqirus has received from BARDA in response to sustained highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) activity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), avian influenza A(H5) virus is widespread in wild birds around the world and is causing multistate outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows.6,7 Several human cases of avian influenza A(H5) virus infection have also been reported in the U.S.6,7 While the current public health risk is low, the CDC continues to watch the situation carefully and work with states to monitor people with animal exposures.6,7 "Pandemics are a natural phenomenon and have occurred at infrequent and unpredictable intervals throughout human history, presenting a real and serious risk to public health," said Dave Ross, General Manager of CSL Seqirus. "Recent avian influenza outbreaks underscore the importance of pandemic preparedness. With this expanded award, BARDA is once again entrusting us to work in collaboration to protect public health." The VMI program has been supported in whole or in part with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) under contract HHSO100200900101C. About Pandemic InfluenzaInfluenza is a contagious airborne respiratory disease.8,9 The risk of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality is greater with pandemic influenza than with seasonal influenza because there is likely to be little or no pre-existing immunity to the novel virus in the human population.10 The timing and severity of pandemic influenza is unpredictable. Four influenza pandemics have occurred over the past century, with the 1918 pandemic being the most severe in recent history, with an estimated mortality of up to 50 million people worldwide.11 About Avian InfluenzaAvian influenza spreads predominantly among birds.12 Avian influenza viruses do not normally infect humans, however, in rare cases humans have been infected with avian influenza viruses.13 Illness in humans from avian influenza has varied in levels of severity, from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease and death.13 The spread of avian influenza from one human to another is very rare and typically has only spread to a few people.13 The recent rise in avian influenza among birds has been driven by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1).14 CSL Seqirus recommends referring to the WHO statement, and CDC, ECDC or national guidance to gauge the levels of concern regarding the high levels of HPAI activity.6,15,16 About CSL SeqirusCSL Seqirus is part of CSL (ASX:CSL).

A study published in Nature provides answers about the behavior of these viruses in cattle, the sites of virus replication, and probable routes of transmission.The first reports of this unusual outbreak describe a decline in milk yield, virus multiplication in the udder and high excretion rates in the milk. As of September 2024, more than 200 dairy farms in 14 US states have been affected, with additional farms testing positive regularly being added to the list. In addition, 15 human infections with the bovine-associated avian influenza virus have been confirmed to date (four of which were directly linked to contact with infected cattle or their milk). However, many questions were still unanswered or only poorly supported by data: Can the American bovine H5N1 virus of clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13 also replicate in the respiratory tract? Can European avian influenza viruses of subtype H5N1 also multiply in the udder? How severe is the disease in cattle, how long is the virus excreted in the milk and does it spread systemically in the individual animal?A group of researchers from the FLI on the island of Riems, together with researchers from Kansas State University (KSU) in Kansas, USA, have now been able to answer these questions by means of two independent, experimental infection trials in lactating cows (FLI) and calves (KSU). The FLI was able to show that a direct H5N1 infection of the udder led to severe symptoms, sometimes with high fever and mastitis, regardless of whether the virus isolate used originated from the USA or Europe. Very high virus loads were detected in the milk of all infected cows and milk production decreased rapidly. However, neither nasal virus replication nor systemic spread was observed throughout the body of the infected cows. In contrast to the already cattle-adapted bovine strain from the USA, a single mammalian adaptation was detected very early in a viral protein of the European H5N1 isolate responsible for virus replication (polymerase PB2 E627K substitution).The KSU researchers were able to show that an oronasal H5N1 infection of calves with the US strain resulted in only moderate virus replication in the respiratory tract and that the virus was not transmitted to contact calves. “These two important animal studies allow us to conclude that, in addition to the American H5N1 variant, other H5N1 viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b are also able to replicate efficiently in the bovine udder tissue and are excreted in high quantities in the milk.”, says the head of the study at the FLI, Prof. Dr. Martin Beer, Head of the Institute of Virus Diagnostics and Vice President of the FLI. “It is also very clear that in the USA, milk and milking procedures are primarily responsible for the spread and transmission between dairy cows, rather than the respiratory route.”Both research teams conclude with an urgent call for immediate, effective and comprehensive measures to stop the ongoing spread in cattle in the USA as quickly as possible, to prevent further genetic adaptations of the virus and thereby prevent further transmission to poultry, wild birds and other mammals, including humans.The study was published in the prestigious journal “Nature” on 25.09.2024: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08063-yThis work was funded by the ‘KAPPA-FLU’ project (Horizon Europe programme, project no. 101084171) and the ‘DURABLE’ project, co-financed by the European Union (EU4Health programme, project no. 101102733) and the BMBF project ‘PREPMEDVET’ (project no. 13N15449).

While some people are at higher risk for severe illness, physicians can’t always predict who will get seriously ill. For example, 30% of all children hospitalized for COVID-19 have no underlying conditions. Advancing public health AMA membership offers unique access to savings and resources tailored to enrich the personal and professional lives of physicians, residents and medical students. Learn More “Immunizations are our best defense,” said Dr. Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In a CDC Project Firstline webinar, she urged physicians to strongly recommend that patients get vaccinated against influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), if applicable. Even if a patient hesitates on vaccination, they might eventually agree especially if they have high-risk conditions and visit the doctor often. Be open to questions and make sure this is a dialogue, Dr. Cohen said. Physicians can quickly engage their patients by saying, “This is what I’d do for my own family.” Dr. Cohen joined AMA President Bruce A. Scott, MD, and two other experts from CDC National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Demetre Daskalakis, MD, MPH, directs that CDC center and Manisha Patel, MD, MS, is its chief medical officer. Together, the panelists discussed vaccinations, treatment and tips for encouraging immunization. Know who is eligible for vaccination Know who is eligible for vaccination The updated 2024–2025 COVID-19 and influenza recommendations are quite straightforward, said Dr. Cohen. Everyone 6 months or older should get the updated COVID-19 vaccine and, with rare exceptions, the flu vaccine, including pregnant people. Children 6 months to 8 years old receiving their first influenza vaccine, who have not previously received a total of two or more doses in their lives, or whose influenza vaccination history is unknown need two doses.In adults 65 or older, the CDC preferentially recommends a higher dose flu vaccine or adjuvanted flu vaccine over standard-dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines, if available. For RSV, all infants under 8 months as well as children 8 months–19 months with risk factors should get the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab, which is typically given October through March. There is also a maternal RSV vaccine, which is recommended during pregnancy between 32- and 36-weeks’ gestation. This is typically given September through January. Both products offer substantial protection for infants against severe RSV, said Dr. Patel. She reminded physicians that patients who are pregnant should only get the ABRYSVO vaccine manufactured by Pfizer. For older adults, the CDC clarified the recommendations going into this season. All adults 75 or older, as well as adults 60 through 74 who are at increased risk for severe RSV, are recommended to get the RSV vaccine. Risk factors for severe RSV include underlying conditions such as obesity, diabetes, heart or lung disease, or living in a nursing home Physicians can make decisions on RSV need, based on the information they have about a specific patient and their risk, said Dr. Daskalakis. RSV vaccines are 70% and 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations in older adults and infants, respectively. “If folks are at higher risk, make sure you are having a conversation with them about the RSV vaccine,” said Dr. Cohen. The CDC is seeing more RSV circulating in nursing homes, so “we really want to make sure anyone who is residing in that group setting is protected from RSV going into this season,” she urged. Prepare your office Prepare your office It’s important that your office is set up and prepared for having conversations with patients about vaccination, so you don’t miss an opportunity to give out those doses. “Every time someone walks into your office is an opportunity,” she said. Ideally administration of the updated 2024-2025 flu vaccine, should happen in September through October, but flu vaccination is recommended as long as influenza viruses are circulating in the community. The recommended window for the RSV vaccine during pregnancy, runs from September through January, and the infant RSV monoclonal antibody should ideally be administered October through March. However, it is important to note, the timing of the onset, peak and decline of RSV activity vary geographically. Physicians may adjust timing of administration based on guidance from public health authorities such as the CDC and local health departments. Note that the CDC has new tools on its website to make ordering immunizations easier. Meanwhile, the AMA will continue to partner with the CDC to support and advise health professionals and patients during this respiratory season, said Dr. Scott.

Subscribe Now Continue to encourage vaccination Continue to encourage vaccination The CDC continues to see lower uptake of these annual vaccines than preferred, “but we know that they are our best defense against those serious illnesses that we know make our patients sick each and every fall and winter season,” said Dr. Cohen. One of the main reasons someone doesn't get a vaccine is their doctor didn't recommend it. Making that strong recommendation for either the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, flu shot or both if co-administering, is very critical. This doesn’t have to be an hour-long conversation.You could say to the patient, “You're due for your updated flu and COVID-19 vaccines today. I've gotten these vaccines myself and I recommend them for you too,” said Dr. Cohen.Even if a patient declines one time, “don't make that a permanent way of them approaching vaccination. Your voice matters. They trust you and your recommendation,” she urged. People may not say yes in that moment, but they could come back the next time and be more open to it.Physicians should also make sure they’re embedding vaccination into their office workflows, setting reminder calls for patients and using clinical decision support tools. An example of this is a care gaps list that can track what immunizations your patients may need. Concerns over medical contraindications is another reason why physicians don't recommend vaccines. “We want to reiterate that contraindications to these vaccines are exceptionally rare,” said Dr. Cohen. Address cost barriers Address cost barriers Cost is a real barrier to vaccination for some patients. “The good news is we do have an ability to cover a lot of that cost for our children,” said Dr. Cohen.She urged that physicians join the CDC’s Vaccines for Children's program, which provides free vaccines to children, Medicaid-eligible adults, Native Americans and other populations.Many private insurers are required to cover these vaccines without charging a co-payment or co-insurance when they're given by an in-network provider. Medicare Part B also covers COVID-19 and flu vaccines.
