People with diabetes should avoid the nasal spray flu vaccine, opting for injectable vaccines. If you have diabetes and experience flu symptoms, call your health care provider right away. CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people with diabetes who have flu infection or suspected flu infection. Background Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how your body turns food into energy. There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (diabetes while pregnant). More than 122 million Americans are living with diabetes (37.3 million) or prediabetes (96 million). People with diabetes (type 1, type 2, or gestational), even when well-managed, are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. These complications can result in hospitalization and sometimes even death. Flu-related complications include pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and ear infections. About 30% of adults hospitalized with flu reported to the CDC had diabetes in recent seasons. Acute illnesses like the flu can make controlling blood sugar levels harder. The flu may raise blood sugar levels. For example, a reduced appetite when sick can cause blood sugar levels to fall. People with diabetes need to follow the sick day guidelines if they become ill. Vaccination is the best protection against flu Flu vaccination is especially important for people with diabetes because they are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. Flu vaccination also has been associated with reduced hospitalizations among people with diabetes (79%). Flu Vaccines for People with Diabetes Injectable influenza vaccines (flu shots) are recommended for use in people with diabetes and certain other health conditions. Flu shots have a long, established safety record and studies support the safety of flu vaccines in people with diabetes. People with diabetes should generally not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine (i.e., the live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV). Your doctor or other health care professional can answer any questions you might have about flu vaccine. Pneumococcal vaccination is also important Having flu increases your risk of getting pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death. People with diabetes should be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination. This vaccination helps protect against pneumococcal pneumonia and other serious infections. You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine. Pneumococcal vaccination should be part of a diabetes management plan. Talk to your healthcare provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you. Other Preventive Actions for People with Diabetes In addition to getting a flu vaccine, people with diabetes should follow the CDC's everyday preventive actions. These include avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often. They can also take steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces.

Ensure you have a least a two-week supply of necessary medications on hand. If you experience flu symptoms, call your healthcare provider right away. Antiviral drugs can treat flu illness and may prevent serious flu complications. CDC recommends prompt flu treatment for people who have flu infection or suspected flu infection.

Therefore, influenza vaccine strains need to be updated annually for the upcoming flu season to ensure vaccine effectiveness. We develop a computational approach, beth-1, to forecast virus evolution and select representative virus for influenza vaccine. The method involves modelling site-wise mutation fitness. Informed by virus genome and population sero-positivity, we calibrate transition time of mutations and project the fitness landscape to future time, based on which beth-1 selects the optimal vaccine strain. In season-to-season prediction in historical data for the influenza A pH1N1 and H3N2 viruses, beth-1 demonstrates superior genetic matching compared to existing approaches. In prospective validations, the model shows superior or non-inferior genetic matching and neutralization against circulating virus in mice immunization experiments compared to the current vaccine. The method offers a promising and ready-to-use tool to facilitate vaccine strain selection for the influenza virus through capturing heterogeneous evolutionary dynamics over genome space-time and linking molecular variants to population immune response.

In response, influenza vaccines need to be updated annually to match the circulating virus population2. Prediction of virus evolution has a critical role in ensuring the protective effect of influenza vaccines, which aids the selection of candidate vaccine strains nearly a year ahead before the arrival of next epidemic season2,3. We present a computational approach to predict influenza virus evolution through modeling the dynamic process of mutation adaptation at individual sites and locating the optimal wild-type strains by a combined evaluation of multiple gene segments for considerations of vaccine strains.Virus evolution is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic mutations, host immune response, and epidemiology1,4. Thus, although mutation is stochastic5,6, the evolutionary process could be traced with the observed viral genetic and antigenic profiling in the host population6. The influenza virus evolves through antigenic drift on the two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), the primary immuno-active components of influenza vaccines. Previous studies showed that mutations at epitope sites of the HA played a dominant role in characterizing virus antigenic change and were under higher immune selection pressure5,7. In addition to the major antigenic substitutions, the virus evolution is also critically influenced by epistatic mutations or mutation interference effects8,9,10, making predictions challenging as the evolutionary dynamics are non-uniform across genomic regions and time.Currently, influenza vaccine strain determination involves extensive surveillance and characterization of the virus in terms of genetic, antigenic evolution, and epidemiological profiles, a global effort coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO)11. While antigenic evolution of influenza virus can be mapped by the antigenic cartography based on hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assay data12, genetic evolution is mostly delineated with the phylogenetic trees13. Current prediction methods of virus evolution mainly focus on modeling the fitness of tree parts14,15,16, using sequences of the HA or HA1 segment, with epitope or antigenic data incorporated as component information14,15,17. For instance, Łuksza and Lässig calculated frequency of tree-clades and predicted the future predominant clade by an exponential function (the Malthusian model) with a certain growth rate14. Neher et al. used the local branching index (LBI) to rank tree-nodes in a given phylogeny to identify lineage with the highest fitness as a progenitor of strains in an upcoming influenza season, where fitness is estimated by integrating exponentially discounted branch-length surrounding a node16. Steinbrück and McHardy used allele dynamics plots to identify the top three alleles characterizing antigenic novelty of tree-clades in a given season, pre-screened based on the epitope information, HI data, and phylogeny17,18. Also based on the Malthusian model, Huddleston et al. regarded strain rather than clade as a primary unit of analysis, and investigated different combination of factors to calculate growth rate for strains15. These methods projected the most likely predominant future lineages by tracing the fitness of clusters of strains. However, as virus evolution is driven by major antigenic substitutions, a substantial amount of information is contained in the dynamic process of the fitness of mutations, characterizing which might provide critical information for predicting genetic evolution.ResultsA site-based dynamic model for mutation forecastingOur prediction method is primarily based on modeling the time-resolved frequency pattern of mutations for individual sites across virus genome segments (Fig. 1). The selective advantage of a mutation could be reflected in their growing prevalence in the host population. To make a projection into the future, the velocity of mutation frequency growth can be estimated by solving the first-order derivative of a frequency function over a period of mutation adaption in the host population, which is captured by the mutation transition time (Methods). Since the transition time is specific to substituted residues, the dynamic model is site-based and time-dependent. Scanning over the genome restores a global picture of mutation-selection. Such design shares the advantage of the agent-based model that agglomerates individual agents carrying simple rules and avoids fitting a complicated system with copious parameters or unrealistic assumptions19. The potential relationship between the genome-wide dynamics of mutation prevalence and population epidemics is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1. The site-based model is also highly computationally efficient in analyzing large genomic datasets.Fig. 1: Overview of the computational model and study design.Site-wise fitness dynamics are modeled and projected to the next season (T + 1). Based on the predicted genome-wide fitness landscape of future virus population, an optimal wild-type virus can be selected integrating evolutionary information of both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. The prediction is validated by genetic mismatch against observed circulating viruses in the Northern Hemisphere retroactively and prospectively for pH1N1 and H3N2. In addition, mouse model is used to evaluate the antibodies elicited by predicted vaccine strain in neutralizing the clinical isolates in 2019/20 season.Full size imageSpecifically, transition time in this study is defined as the duration for a mutation to emerge until it reaches an influential frequency in the population. This quantity is related to but different from the conventional fixation time, which covers a period from the first observation time of a mutation to the point when it reaches 0.99 prevalence in the population. The fixation time was reported to span over a long period of 4-32 years for the influenza virus A(H3N2)8. In contrast, the transition time we identified for the same viral subtype had a median length of only ~17 months and ranged between 0-7 years (Supplementary Fig. 2). As the transition time calibrates the initial period of mutation adaptation, it may have the advantage of informing the emerging genetic variants on a short-term time horizon. The transition time is determined with a frequency threshold (θ) indicating fitness strength, at which the overall mutation activities are detected to influence population epidemics significantly (Supplementary Fig. 1); and it can be estimated using the virus epidemic-genetic association model we previously developed20 (Methods).This site-based mutation dynamic model enables the prediction for fitness of competing residues at individual sites, thereby the construction of a genome-wide fitness landscape of the virus population in future time (Fig. 1).Identification of optimal wild-type virusSince regulations for influenza vaccines requires the use of a wild-type virus as vaccine strain, we next select the optimal wild-type strain based on the predicted virus population (Fig. 1). First, a consensus strain can be shaped containing all mutations showing selective advantage relative to their precedent or competing alleles in the upcoming epidemic season. Next, the optimal wild-type virus can be located by minimizing the weighted genetic distance between a candidate strain and the projected future consensus strain considering one or more proteins contained in vaccine antigen (Methods). Although only HA concentration is standardized in the current vaccine production21, both HA and NA genes are major components of the influenza vaccines; an integrative evaluation would provide a useful tool for strain selection and evaluation.This two-step evolution prediction and wild-type virus selection method are referred to as the “beth-1” for easy reference.Genetic matching of retroactively predicted vaccine strainsWe applied the beth-1 to predict vaccine strains of the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) and A (H3N2) viruses. Data was collected from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)22 between 1999/2000 and 2022/23, involving a total number of 13,192 HA and 11,260 NA sequences of pH1N1, and 37,093 HA and 34,037 NA sequences of H3N2 from ten geographical regions in the Northern Hemisphere, covering North America (New York State, California State, Canada), Europe (United Kingdom, Germany, France), and Asia (Hong Kong SAR, South China provinces, Japan, Singapore) (Supplementary Table 2). Three-year data was burnt-in for model building. The prediction was performed using data up to February in season T, targeting the subsequent epidemic season T + 1 (October-April next year). We calculate the average amino acid (AA) mismatch between the predicted strain and sequences of circulating viruses in the target season to determine prediction accuracy. To fully understand the performance of beth-1 in the context of existing methods, we calculated the following comparison groups: (1) WHO-recommended vaccine strains (the “current-system”) for season T + 1; (2) The local branching index (LBI) method16, as the representative approach based on phylogenetic trees; (3) beth-1 (single protein): the beth-1 predicted strains for season T + 1 by a single protein; (4) beth-1 (two-protein): predicted strains for season T + 1 integrating two proteins; (5) the “answer”: the observed representative strains in season T + 1 (Methods, Supplementary Tables 3, 4).In the retroactive data, prediction was conducted for seven seasons from 2012/13 to 2018/19 for pH1N1 and 17 seasons from 2002/03 to 2018/19 for the H3N2. beth-1 demonstrated significantly improved genetic matching to the future virus population compared to the LBI and the current-system on full-length HA and NA gene, their epitopes, and for both pH1N1 and H3N2 subtypes (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 5). For example, the beth-1 (HA) model results in 7.5 AAs (SD 2.2) mismatch on the full-length HA protein of H3N2, while mismatch by the LBI and current-system are 9.5 AAs (SD 4.7) and 11.7 AAs (SD 5.1), respectively (pair-wise t-test p-value < 0.001) (Supplementary Table 5). The beth-1 (NA) gives 3.9 AAs (SD 1.5) mismatch on full-length NA protein of pH1N1, significantly lower than the 6.4 AAs (SD 2.1) by the LBI and 11.6 AAs (SD 4.4) by the current-system. Using the beth-1 (two-protein) model, the mismatch on the HA epitopes is 1.2 AAs (0.6) for pH1N1 and 5.1 AAs (SD 1.7) for H3N2. Particularly, the mismatch of beth-1 (two-protein) on the NA epitopes are 0.5 AA (SD 0.4) for pH1N1 and 0.6 AAs (SD 0.5) for the H3N2, close to the best possible outcome by the answer strains. In all these results, beth-1 delivers prevailingly smaller uncertainties (standard deviation) in prediction accuracy compared to the current-system and the LBI (Supplementary Table 5).Fig. 2: Prediction performance in the retrospective data for influenza pH1N1 and H3N2.a Full-length protein. b Epitope. The bar-plots display average genetic mismatch (amino acids, AA) over geographical regions and seven seasons in 2012/13-2018/19 for pH1N1 and 17 seasons in 2002/03-2018/19 for H3N2 (n = 70 region × season strata for each HA and NA of pH1N1, n = 144 and n = 146 available strata for HA and NA of H3N2, respectively). Panel (b) left Y-axis: average genetic mismatch of pH1N1; right Y-axis: average genetic mismatch of H3N2. Prediction methods being compared include: the current-system, LBI, beth-1 (two-protein), beth-1 (single protein), and the actual representative strain. Two-sided p-value is calculated using paired t-test on log mismatch between two methods matched by region and season. The p-value of current-system versus beth-1(two-protein) are 1.4e–15, 6.9e–16, <2.2e–16, <2.2e–16, respectively (a), and <2.2e–16, 4.9e–9, <2.2e–16, 9.0e–14, respectively (b). The p-value of LBI versus beth-1(single protein) are 6.7e–10, 1.5e–12, 1.7e–6, 7.9e–5, respectively (a), and 9.3e–6, 1.1e–8, 6.7e–5, 4.8e–4, respectively (b). In the retrospective validations, beth-1 shows significantly lower genetic mismatch on all the protein segments evaluated for the two influenza subtypes, compared to the LBI and the current-system. Error bar: standard deviation of the average genetic mismatch by region and season. ***: p-value < 0.001.Full size imageSeasonal and geographical breakdown of prediction accuracies were also analyzed. Year-by-year comparison with the LBI and current-system showed that the beth-1 gave vastly lower genetic mismatch throughout the epidemic seasons (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 6–9). A separate analysis by geographical regions showed no systematic difference in vaccine mismatch across continents by all prediction methods and for the two influenza A subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 10–13).Fig. 3: Prediction accuracy of alternative methods for HA evolution in retrospective data by season.a pH1N1, HA full sequence (566 codons). b pH1N1, HA epitopes (50 sites). c H3N2, HA full sequence (566 codons). d H3N2, HA epitopes (131 sites). Prediction accuracy is assessed by the average amino acids mismatch (Y-axis) of the predicted strains against circulating viruses in ten geographical regions in the respective epidemic seasons (X-axis). Error bar: standard deviation of the average genetic mismatch by region in a given season. The average genetic mismatch of beth-1 is prevailingly lower compared to the LBI and the current-system.Full size imageWe performed two predictions for the 2019/20 epidemic season: a prospective prediction conducted in October 2019 using training data up to June 2019; and a retroactive prediction conducted in March 2022 using data up to March 2019 to better match the current-system’s timeline (Supplementary Table 14). Genetic mismatch was calculated for all prediction experiments. Between the 2019-03 and 2019-06 predictions by beth-1, the latter one recorded 0.1 less HA epitope mismatch for pH1N1 and 1.1 less HA epitope mismatch for H3N2. Both predictions showed significantly better genetic matching compared to the current-system on all protein segments of pH1N1, the NA of H3N2, and non-inferior matching in other segments. We further evaluated the immunogenicity of predicted strains for this particular season using clinical samples collected in Hong Kong (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 5). Against the viral isolates of H1 and H3 positive samples, beth-1 strains induced significantly higher neutralizing antibodies in PRNT50 for pH1N1 and non-inferior antibodies for H3N2, compared to the current vaccines (Supplementary Fig. 6).Prospective predictions and validations in 2020/21–2022/23To further validate our prediction method, we conducted prospective predictions from 2020/21 to 2022/23. The predictions were sent to the WHO before the vaccine composition meetings for the Northern Hemisphere each year (Supplementary Table 3). To fully understand the relationship between the beth-1 strains and the current vaccine viruses, we mapped them on phylogenetic trees (Fig. 4). Generally, the beth-1 predicted strains extended more into the future clusters for both influenza subtypes in all seasons of prospective validations compared to the current vaccine strains. On the epitopes of HA and NA of pH1N1 and H3N2, beth-1 demonstrated non-inferior or significantly increased genetic matching to the future circulating viruses (Supplementary Table 15). For instance, in 2020/21, beth-1 gave 2.7 AAs (SD 1.1) mismatch on the HA epitopes of pH1N1 and the current-system gave 3.8 AAs (SD 1.2) (Supplementary Table 15). In the 2021/22 season, beth-1 resulted in 4.2 AAs (SD 1.6) mismatch on the HA epitopes of H3N2, 6.6 AAs more accurate than the current-system’s 10.8 AAs (SD 1.9) mismatch (p-value < 0.001). In the 2022/23 season, beth-1 prediction resulted in 1.0 AA (SD 0.7) mismatch on the HA epitopes of pH1N1 and the current-system gave 3.0 AAs (SD 0.7) mismatch (p-value < 0.001).Fig. 4: Prospectively predicted strains on phylogenetic tree from 2020/21 to 2022/23.a 2020/21, pH1N1. b 2020/21, H3N2. c 2021/22, pH1N1. d 2021/22, H3N2. e 2022/23, pH1N1, f 2023/23, H3N2. Predicted strains by beth-1 (two-protein) and the current-system are marked on phylogenetic trees with red and green, respectively. Predictions were made prospectively for the next epidemic season in the Northern Hemisphere (highlighted by yellow band in the background). The phylogeny relationship shows that beth-1’s predictions are generally more advanced into the future.Full size imageDiscussionPredictability of the pH1N1 and H3N2 virusesPredictability for the two influenza subtypes pH1N1 and H3N2 can be compared on genetic mismatch of HA epitopes in the retrospective data. The ceiling of prediction can be approximated by the answer strain, that is, the observed representative strain in respective seasons. For the pH1N1 virus, the lowest possible mismatch of HA epitope was 0.7 AAs (SD 0.4) achieved by the answer strain, and the beth-1’s mismatch was 1.2 AAs (SD 0.6) (Supplementary Table 5). This suggests that a highly precise hit by predictive modeling is achievable for the pH1N1, such that the resulting vaccine strain could provide an excellent match to the circulating viruses in regions of the Northern Hemisphere. However, for the H3N2 virus, the lowest possible HA epitope mismatch was as large as 3.5 AAs (SD 1.1), that is 2.8 more epitope mismatch compared to the pH1N1. Although the 5.1 AAs (SD 1.7) mismatch by beth-1 was only 1.6 residue away from the answer, the prediction for H3N2 would be ultimately bounded by the ceiling of genetic matching. The large genetic mismatch of the H3N2 answer strain might be attributed to the high genetic diversity of this virus23,24, making the selection of a single representative wild-type strain challenging. New vaccinology strategies, such as developing broadly reactive vaccines, designing antigens containing multiple H3N2 strains, or preparing region-specific vaccines, may provide solutions from other dimensions to enhance vaccine protection against this subtype.Advantages of site-based dynamic model for evolution predictionStrain-based dynamic model often requires the estimation of a single-valued growth rate for a given genome to project future fitness, whereas a site-based dynamic model is not constrained by a constant growth rate over genome space-time. This property leads to the following three advantages in predicting virus evolution with the site-based angle. First, key mutations distributed over multiple clades could be captured as they arise, while the virus is trialing various epistatic combinations before shaping a stable lineage. Second, a site-based model avoids making assumption for directional mutation effects on fitness, which is self-evident in mutation frequency. In contrast, strain-based models often need to assume negative effect for the non-epitope mutations, to offset the genetic distance obtained from gene-based analysis in modeling evolutionary pathway14,15,16, although studies suggested that the alternative might be true25,26. Third, the site-based dynamic model is adaptive to the altered residue fitness from epistasis and environmental factors10,27, by sampling and re-estimating the dynamic function at each time period. When such adaptive framework is not in place, one study showed that the fitness advantage estimated in the initial stage of mutation emergence cannot predict their ultimate fixation28. However, the proposed site-based dynamic model avoids making assumptions on the constant effect of mutations. Through adaptive estimation of fitness by genomic site and time, it projects a probable fitness landscape including all the trackable advantageous mutations to the near future.“Representative” viral strains by the consensus sequence in the perspective of site-based analysisUnder the perspective of strain-based analysis, a representative virus is naturally indicated by the majority vote of strain or clades. While under the perspective of site-based analysis, a genome-wide fitness landscape can be constructed for a virus population, without missing a single mutation showing selective advantage. Based on this fitness landscape, a mode estimator can be operated at individual sites and generate a consensus sequence. Therefore, the consensus sequence is a natural representative strain for a virus population based on site-wise fitness. Beth-1 in its primary objective established the theoretical framework of modeling mutation dynamics site-wise and enabled forecasting for fitness landscape into future time.Dissecting prediction accuracyWe can better understand the power of beth-1 by dissecting its prediction accuracy. The beth-1 (single-protein) gives slightly higher mismatch compared to the consensus strain of the predicted future by beth-1 (future-consensus) (Fig. 5), since the former one corresponds to an available wild-type virus that would be an no better representation of the predicted future compared to the future-consensus. Next, we examine performances of the future-consensus and the current virus population (current-consensus) in the retrospective data. The result shows that the future-consensus generally improves prediction of the current-consensus over genomic regions for both influenza A subtypes (Fig. 5). It should be noted that the degree of advancement is subject to the speed of virus evolution, lead time of prediction, as well as the measurement by genetic mismatch that is under influence of viral diversity. Therefore, although the amount of advancement seems moderate, the results indicate that the site-based model can robustly add to the future that we can correctly foresee. We further analyze the 46 sites that the beth-1 correctly predicts but the current-consensus does not with respect to the answer strain for the H3N2 in the 17 retrospective seasons. Among these sites, 58.7% are epitopes and 71.7% involves physiochemical trait change, which is characterized by a conversion in charge or polarity, or volume change over 20%, and 80.5% of these sites involve either an epitope or physiochemical property change.Fig. 5: Dissecting prediction of beth-1 by consensus strain.a Full-length protein. b Epitope. The bar-plots display average genetic mismatch (amino acids, AA) over seven seasons in 2012/13-2018/19 for pH1N1 and 17 seasons in 2002/03-2018/19 for H3N2 (n = 70 region × season strata for each HA and NA of pH1N1, n = 144 and n = 146 available strata for HA and NA of H3N2, respectively). Panel (b) left Y-axis: average genetic mismatch of pH1N1; right Y-axis: average genetic mismatch of H3N2. We dissect prediction performance of the beth-1 by showing its accuracy achieved at multiple steps. The beth-1 (single protein) is compared to the future-consensus (consensus strain of the predicted future by the beth-1) and the current-consensus (consensus strain of the current virus population). Two-sided p-value is calculated using paired t-test on log mismatch between two methods matched by region and season. The p-value of LBI versus beth-1(single protein) are 6.7e–10, 1.5e–12, 1.7e–6, 7.9e–5, respectively (a), and 9.3e–6, 1.1e–8, 6.7e–5, 4.8e–4, respectively (b). The p-value of current consensus versus beth-1 future consensus are 0.061, 6.1e–5, 0.005, 0.011, respectively (a), and 1, 0.001, 0.009, 0.016, respectively (b). The future-consensus generally advances prediction of the current-consensus on the genomic segments, while beth-1 (single protein) gives slightly higher mismatch compared to the future-consensus. The LBI is displayed to replicate the previous finding involving the current-consensus strain28. Error bar: standard deviation of the average genetic mismatch by region and season. *: p-value < 0.05; **: p-value < 0.01; ***: p-value < 0.001.Full size imageWe next analyze the proportion of newly emerged dominant mutations captured by the site-based model year to year. Using the H3N2 as an example, on the full-length HA protein, the average number of dominant mutations arise each year is 5.3 AA (SD 4.2), estimated from the 17 seasons. The beth-1 captures 2.6 AAs (49.1%) on average of the new dominant mutations in the upcoming seasons, while LBI captures 1.5 AAs (28.3%) and the current-consensus captures 0. This result reveals an interesting fact that although the current-consensus outperforms the LBI in terms of genetic mismatch towards the future virus population28 (Fig. 5), it forecasts no evolutionary advancement in T + 1. Rather, the prediction accuracy achieved by the current-consensus is solely contributed by capturing the center of viral cluster, which results in a smaller spread of genetic distance from a single strain to the circulating viruses. This also indicates that the genetic mismatch as a measure of prediction power is contributed from two aspects: the accuracy in forecasting evolutionary advancement and in locating the center of the mass of viruses. The beth-1 deals with both aspects in a simple and elegant way.Current WHO vaccine virus selection considerationsCurrently, WHO selects vaccine strains by considering the emergence of virus with distinct genetic and antigenic characteristics, their geographical spread, and the potential loss of effective binding of antibodies from antisera of previously vaccinated subjects against the current circulating viruses29. These factors depict a picture of the current global virus population and their antigenic relationship to the previous representative viruses and vaccine strains, based on which recommendations of vaccine strains are made. One major consideration of vaccine strain selection is the HAI titer for antigenic characterization30. Nevertheless, the HAI only evaluates one specific type of reaction, that is the prevention of HA binding to sialic acid receptor on host cells inhibited by the anti-HA head antibodies31, while other types of immune responses are undetected, such as the antibodies against HA-stem and T-cell responses that also play important roles in protection32,33. Developing improved assays with broader range or finer specificity for vaccine protection may facilitate the assessment and selection of vaccine strain29. Another major constraint of the current vaccine strain selection process is the limited availability of high-yield virus in embryonated eggs, with which more than 95% of the current influenza vaccines are produced34. These candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) are prepared from representative strains by the WHO Collaborating Centers (CC) and Essential Regulatory Labs (ERLs) before the annual WHO consultation meetings29. Thus, earlier prediction, even year-round projection of future representative strains may facilitate the preparation of CVVs and the subsequent vaccine strain selection, while the development of alternative vaccine technologies for influenza virus would sidestep the constraints of egg-based platform. The potential of computational optimized vaccine strains may be fully explored coupling with the availability of new production platforms, as “new wine in new wineskins”.Limitations of the studyOne major limitation in our analysis is the sparse time interval, constrained by the sequence sample size in the earlier years. In the future, this sampling gap may be gradually closed with increasing surveillance strength and global collaborations. Second, the epitope mismatch could have been underestimated as it was subjected to the known epitope sites, especially in the immune-subdominant protein segments. Nevertheless, the comparison across prediction methods was fair with the same evaluation criteria.In summary, we have introduced a new computational method, the beth-1, for predicting influenza evolution through the site-based fitness dynamic modeling and enables strain selection considering multiple proteins. The model demonstrated promising prediction performances in both retrospective and prospective real data applications. The framework has potentially wide applications by virology labs, vaccine manufacturers, health authorities and the WHO for indicating virus evolution and preparing vaccine virus, to facilitate influenza vaccine strain selection towards more effective vaccines.MethodsDatasetWe downloaded genetic sequences of the influenza virus from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)22. All samples were retrieved and analyzed if the strain has complete sequence and were isolated from the target epidemic seasons and geographical regions (Supplementary Table 2). The data of genetic sequences for pH1N1 spanned from 2009/10 to 2022/23, and for the H3N2 from 1999/2000 to 2022/23. Ten geographical regions in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) were considered, including North America (New York State, California State, Canada), Europe (United Kingdom, Germany, France), and Asia (Hong Kong SAR, South China provinces, Japan, Singapore). In 2020/21 and 2021/22, due to sharp decline of available samples in these regions, all sequences in NH were considered. Overall, the total number of genetic sequences used in analysis was 50,285 for the HA and 45,297 for the NA. Sequence alignment was performed by MEGA (7.0.26)35. All statistical analysis were conducted in R version 4.1.336. All p-values reported are two-sided.The model for evolution prediction and strain selection: beth-1In the following, we introduce the beth-1 model in four parts: (1) Introduction of the transition time that characterizes mutation dynamics; (2) Estimation of transition parameters; (3) Prediction of future virus fitness; (4) Identification of the wild-type virus closest to the predicted virus population. A flowchart of the method is provided in Supplementary Fig. 7.Transition timeLet \({x}_{{jk}}(t)\) denote amino acid residue or nucleotide type at time t and site j,\(j\in J\), where J is the set of sequence positions and \(k\in K=[{{{{\mathrm{1,20}}}}}]\) indexes alternative substitutions observed at site j. The prevalence of \({x}_{{jk}}(t)\) is denoted by \({p}_{{jk}}\left(t\right)\). We use a prevalence threshold θ to detect the mutations that demonstrate selective advantage in the host population, \(\theta \in \Theta=({{{{\mathrm{0,1}}}}})\). The mutation transition time describes the period for an emerging mutation to reach θ from 0 prevalence. Let \({t}_{{jk}}^{0}\) denote the time point when \({p}_{{jk}}\left(t\right)=0\) and \({p}_{{jk}}\left(t+1\right) > 0\), and \({t}_{{jk}}^{\theta }\) denote the time when \({p}_{{jk}}\left(t\right)=\theta\) for the first time after \({t}_{{jk}}^{0}\). The transition time (\(\tau\)) for a particular mutation \({x}_{{jk}}(t)\) is defined as$${\tau }_{{jk}}\left(\theta \right)={t}_{{jk}}^{\theta }-{t}_{{jk}}^{0}.$$ (1) \(\tau > 0\). Since mutations might occur multiple times in history at the same site by the prediction time T, we can estimate the site-specific transition time \({\tau }_{j}\left(\theta {|T}\right)\) using the average transition time of \({x}_{{jk}}(t)\) for \(k\in K\) and \(t\le T\). When no history of transition event is available at the site, its transition time is estimated by the mean transition time of mutations from the same protein in the training data (Supplementary Table 16).Estimation of the transition parametersThe threshold θ is the level of prevalence for a mutation to demonstrate selective advantage in the population, which is jointly estimated with another parameter \(h\ge 0\) that quantifies the duration of a mutation to remain in advantage after reaching θ. With \((\theta,h)\), the Effective Mutations (EMs) are those mutations that reach θ and within its effective mutation period, namely, \(\tau+h\). The EMs are formally defined as the indicator function$${m}_{{jk}}\left(\theta,h,t\right)\triangleq I\{{t}_{{jk}}^{0}\le t\le {t}_{{jk}}^{\theta }+h\},$$ (2) \(j\in J\), \(k\in K\), and \(t\in [1,T]\). The overall level of mutation activities in the population can be summarized by the sum of prevalence of the EMs via the g-measure$$g\left(\theta,h,t\right)={{{{{\bf{m}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{(}}}}}}\theta,h,t{{{{{\boldsymbol{)}}}}}}\cdot {{{{{\bf{p}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{(}}}}}}{{{{{\rm{t}}}}}}{{{{{\boldsymbol{)}}}}}}=\mathop{\sum}\limits_{j,k}{m}_{{jk}}(\theta,h,t){p}_{{jk}}\left(t\right),$$ (3) The \((\theta,h)\) is estimated through fitting the g-measure and epidemic level, \(y(t)\), which equals the annual sero-positivity rate in this study. Consider the linear regression model,$$y(t)=\beta g\left(\theta,h,t\right)+\mathop{\sum}\limits_{l}{\alpha }_{l}{z}_{l}\left(t\right)+{{{{{\rm{\varepsilon }}}}}},$$ (4) in which \({z}_{l}(t)\) are covariates including mean temperature, absolute humidity and season in a geographical region. The parameters \(\beta\) and \({\alpha }_{l}\) are coefficients of the g-measure and the covariates, respectively, and \(\varepsilon\) is a random error, \(\varepsilon \sim N(0,{\sigma }^{2})\). The \(\left(\theta,h\right)\) can be estimated by maximizing the goodness-of-fit of the linear regression model (Eq. 4), such that the epidemic trend is concordant with the mutation spread in the population. Suppose the R-square, \(R(\theta,h)\), is used as the goodness-of-fit statistic, we have,$$\left(\widehat{\theta },\widehat{h}\right)={{\arg }}\mathop{\max }\limits_{\theta \in \Theta,{{{{{\rm{h}}}}}}\in {{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}}R\big(\theta,h\big).$$ (5) \(\Theta=({{{{\mathrm{0,1}}}}})\) and \({{{{{\rm{H}}}}}}=\{{{{{\mathrm{0,1,2}}}}},\ldots \}\). The parameters \(\theta\) and \(h\) are jointly estimated for each geographical region. The fitted \(\left(\theta,h\right)\) can be found in Supplementary Table 16 and the estimated EMs in Supplementary Table 1. We showed in previous works that the g-measure is a good predictor for epidemic cycles of the A(H3N2)20, A(H1N1)pdm0937 and COVID-1938,39, and \(y(t)\) can adopt other measures for epidemic level, such as the time-varying reproduction number Rt38,39.Prediction of future virus fitnessPrediction of future mutation fitness can be made by solving a classical initial value problem of the differential equation,$$\left\{\begin{array}{c}{f}^{{\prime} }\left(t\right)=F\left[t,{p}_{{jk}}\left(t\right),{\tau }_{j}\left(\theta {{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}t\right)\right],t > T\\ f\left(T\right)=\eta \end{array}\right.,$$ (6) where f(t) is a function describing mutation prevalence through time, \(F[t,{p}_{{jk}}(t),{\tau }_{j}(\theta {|t})]\) is the velocity of the prevalence change, \(\eta\) is the initial value, and T is the prediction time. Using the Euler’s method, the projected mutation prevalence at time T + 1 for substitution k at position j is,$${\hat{p}}_{{jk}}\left(T+1\right)=\left\{{p}_{{jk}}\left(T\right)+F\left[T,{p}_{{jk}}\left(T\right),{\tau }_{j}\left(\hat{\theta }{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}T\right)\right]\right\}\cdot C,$$ (7) where \(C=1/\mathop{\sum}\limits_{k\in K}\{{p}_{{jk}}(T)+F[T,{p}_{{jk}}(T),{\tau }_{j}(\hat{\theta }{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}T)]\}\) is a normalization constant.Equation 7 gives the forecasted future virus fitness. In practice, the time interval shall be chosen such that the training data can support a robust estimation. In the earlier seasons, only a few influenza sequence samples were available each year in many regions, thus yearly interval is chosen. Specifically,$$F\left[T,{p}_{{jk}}\left(T\right),{\tau }_{j}\left(\hat{\theta }{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}T\right)\right]=\frac{\Delta {p}_{{jk}}\left(T\right)}{\Delta t}=\frac{{p}_{{jk}}\left(T\right)-{p}_{{jk}}\bigg[T-{\tau }_{j}\left(\hat{\theta }{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}T\right)\bigg]}{{\tau }_{j}\left(\hat{\theta }{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}T\right)}.$$ (8) The prediction model is trained using sample sequences from the South-east Asia region that is the source of influenza A epidemics40,41; for the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons during COVID-19 pandemic, all Northern Hemisphere samples were used.Identification of the closest wild-type virus to the forecasted virus populationRegulation for influenza vaccines requires the use of wild-type virus in vaccine antigen, therefore, we next identify the closest wild-type virus to the forecasted virus population. First, we use a consensus strain to represent the future virus population,$$\left\{{x}_{j}^{c}(T+1)\right\}\triangleq \left\{{x}_{{jc}}(T+1){{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}c={k}_{j}^{*}\right\},$$ (9) in which,$${k}_{j}^{*}={{\arg }}\mathop{\max }\limits_{k\in K}{\hat{p}}_{{jk}}\left(T+1\right).$$Thus, \(\{{x}_{j}^{c}\left(T+1\right)\}\) consists of the most advantageous mutations in T + 1 through the mode estimator. For a given gene s, its future consensus strain is estimated by Eq. (9) and denoted by \(\{{x}_{{sj}}^{c}\left(T+1\right)\}\).When evaluating “closeness” between strains, obviously not all sites in the genome are equally important. Thus, we consider only the sites that are informative to vaccine effectiveness (VE) when calculating genetic distance. These sites are known as the predictor codon set, which we identified previously in modeling the relationship between VE and genetic distance (VE-GD)42,43. The predictor codon set is composed of EMs residing in the epitope regions of the HA and NA genes43 and is listed in Supplementary Table 1. EMs in T + 1 are obtained using the projected \({\hat{p}}_{{jk}}\left(T+1\right)\) in Eq. (7). Denote the predictor codon set of gene s identified up to T + 1 by \(W\left(T+1{|s}\right)\), \(s\in S=\{{HA},{NA}\}\). The genetic distance between a candidate wild-type sequence i and the future consensus strain for gene s is given by$${d}_{s}^{i}\left(T+1\right)=\mathop{\sum}\limits_{j\in W\left(T+1{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}s\right)}I\{{{x}_{{sj}}^{i}\ne x}_{{sj}}^{c}(T+1)\}.$$ (10) The optimal wild-type virus can be located by minimizing the weighted sum of distances on both HA and NA$$\left\{{x}_{j}^{v}\right\}={{\arg }}\mathop{\min }\limits_{i\in N(T)}\left\{{x}_{j}^{i}{{{{{\rm{|}}}}}}\mathop{\sum}\limits_{s\in S}{b}_{s}{d}_{s}^{i}\left(T+1\right)\right\},$$ (11) where \(N(T)\) is the set of available wild-type viruses on and before time T, \({b}_{s}\) are the weights for gene s estimated by the VE-GD model for influenza42,43, \({b}_{{HA}}:{b}_{{NA}}=1:3\) for the pH1N1, and 1: 1.8 for the H3N2 (p-value < 0.001). Equation (11) gives the optimal wild-type virus identified by beth-1 for considerations of vaccine strains. For beth-1 (two-protein) model, \(S=\{{HA},{NA}\}\), and for beth-1 (single-protein) model, \(S=\{{HA}\,{or}\,{NA}\}\).Vaccine strains predicted by alternative modelsThe list of predicted strains by alternative methods can be found in Supplementary Table 3–4. The answer strain is set as the closest wild-type to the consensus sequence in season T + 1 obtained using the observed data. The predicted strains of LBI16 are obtained by running the model’s source code in python (https://github.comneher/FitnessInference) on the same training data as the beth-1 by gene. In each season, a new tree is built for the LBI using default parameters (eps_branch =10−5, tau = 0.0625, outgroup= “A/Puerto Rico/8/1934” for pH1N1, “A/Hong Kong/1/1968” for H3N2). When the highest LBI score corresponds to more than one strain, one of the strains is randomly picked. Two-sample t-test is used to compare log mismatch against circulating viruses between alternative prediction models in a given season. When comparing model performances over multiple seasons, paired t-test of two methods by season is used to control seasonal variation.Phylogenetic treeTo better visualize the predicted strains, we present them in the time-scaled maximum-likelihood phylogenies generated from TreeTime44. The input tree was built by IQ-TREE45,46 with the default parameters (bootstrap analysis = ultrafast, number of bootstraps = 1000, perturbation strength = 0.5). Genetic sequences for building the tree were sampled in proportion to continent distributions in the corresponding epidemic season, targeting a total number of 400 sequences per season for each of the pH1N1 and H3N2 subtype per season. In 2020/21, all available sequences of pH1N1 in the NH were used.Clinical samples for animal experimentBetween October 2019 to February 2020, a total number of 117 positive H1 and 43 H3 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected in the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR. Ten samples from each of the H1 and H3 subtypes were randomly selected for virus isolation in humanized Madin-Darby canine kidney (hMDCK) cells47. The sequences of the HA gene from each virus was then determined by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses belonged to the same clusters of their respective subtype in these isolates, of which HA ectodomain shared >98% amino acids similarity for the pH1N1 and >96% for H3N2. Thus, one pH1N1 and one H3N2 virus from these isolates were randomly selected for animal experiments. Human study ethics approval has been obtained from the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong—New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee.Cell culturehMDCK cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells were used in this study. Both cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 25 mM HEPES, and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (PS; Gibco).Virus rescuing by reverse geneticsThe H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) eight-plasmid reverse genetic system was used to produce the recombinant influenza virus with the predicted HA and NA genes48. Chimeric 6:2 recombinant viruses with six internal genes from PR8 (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) and 2 genes (HA and NA) from strain of interest were synthesized by Sangon Technology (Guangzhou, China) and were cloned into the pHW2000 vector49. The HEK 293 T cells and hMDCK cells were then mixed at a ratio of 2:1 one-day before transfection and co-cultured in a 6-well plate until they reached 70% confluence. For each recombinant virus, 16 μL TransIT®-LT1 (Mirus) and 1 μg for each of the 8 plasmids encoding the corresponding virus fragments were mixed thoroughly for transfection. The medium was replaced with 1 mL of MEM supplemented with 25 mM HEPES and 100 U/mL PS at 6-hour post transfection. At 24-hour post-transfection, another 1 mL of MEM was added, supplemented 25 mM HEPES, 100 U/mL PS, and 1 μg/mL tosylphenylalanyl chloride methyl ketone (TPCK) trypsin (Sigma). At 72-hour post-transfection, cell supernatants were inoculated into hMDCK cells maintained in MEM containing 25 mM HEPES, 100 U/mL PS, and 1 μg/mL TPCK trypsin. The viruses were harvested at 72 hours after infection and titrated by plaque assay.Immunization of the influenza vaccine virus in a mouse modelThe research protocol of animal experiment was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations and was approved by the Teaching and Research Committee on the Use of Live Animals (CULATR 5598-20) of the University of Hong Kong. Batches of ten 8-10 weeks old female BALB/c mice were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p) with 105 PFU of Addavax-adjuvant recombinant virus in 200 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Gibco). At twenty-one days post immunization, peripheral blood was drawn from the immunized mice by cardiac puncture, and the serum was collected by centrifugation. All sera were treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE; Sigma) for 16–18 hours to reduce non-specific antibodies, then heated at 56 degrees for 30 minutes to inactivate the RDE residue. The serum was stored at −80 degrees for further experiments.Immunogenicity assessment based on plaque reduction neutralization testhMDCK cells were used for virus titration by plaque assay and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). hMDCK cells were prepared in a 12-well plate at least 24 hours before PRNT and cultured until obtaining a 100% confluent monolayer in each well. Two-fold serial dilutions of antiserum from 1:10 to 1:1280 were prepared, where each 100 μL was mixed with 100 PFU of viruses and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour. Cells were washed once with PBS and inoculated with corresponding virus-antiserum mixture for further incubation at 37 °C for one hour. After that, the supernatant in each well was replaced with 3 mL of MEM supplied with a final concentration of 25 mM HEPES, 100 U/mL PS, 1% agarose gel, and 1 μg/mL TPCK trypsin. Against the live viruses, the highest dilution of the antiserum that inhibited at least 50% of the viral plaques (PRNT50 titer) was recorded. The plate was inverted and incubated at 37 °C for 48 hours. Finally, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for virus plaque counting. We recorded the highest dilution of the antiserum that inhibited at least 50% of the viral plaques as the PRNT50 titer of the antiserum.

Outbreaks in pigs can cause widespread illness, but rarely do they result in deaths. These viruses do not typically infect humans, but rare human infections have occurred. About swine flu in pigs Swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza virus that regularly causes outbreaks of influenza in pigs. Swine flu viruses can cause high levels of illness in pig herds but cause few deaths in pigs. Swine influenza viruses can circulate among swine throughout the year, but most outbreaks occur during the late fall and winter months similar to outbreaks in humans. Types Like influenza viruses in humans and other animals, swine influenza viruses change constantly. Pigs can be infected by avian influenza and human influenza viruses as well as swine influenza viruses. When influenza viruses from different species infect pigs, the viruses can reassort (swap genes) and new viruses that are a mix of swine, human and/or avian influenza viruses can emerge. Over the years, different variations of swine flu viruses have emerged. At this time, there are three main influenza A virus subtypes that have been isolated in pigs in the United States: H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. Signs and symptoms Signs of swine flu in pigs can include: fever depression coughing (barking) discharge from the nose or eyes sneezing or breathing difficulties eye redness or inflammation and going off feed. How it spreads Flu A viruses spread among pigs in the same way that human flu viruses spread among people. That is mainly through droplets containing flu A virus that spread through the air when infected pigs cough or sneeze. Swine flu viruses can also be spread among pigs mostly through close contact and possibly from contaminated objects moving between infected and uninfected pigs. Pigs also can be infected by flu A viruses from their human caretakers. Infected swine herds, including those vaccinated against swine flu, may have sporadic disease, or may show only mild or no symptoms of infection. Vaccines Just as there are influenza vaccines for people, there are specific swine influenza vaccines available for pigs. Flu vaccines for pigs can help reduce the risk of pigs getting flu but may not be 100% effective. Sometimes, flu vaccines used in pigs may not protect against the virus or viruses that are spreading in pigs, because the vaccine virus may not match the influenza A virus that is circulating in the pigs. Animal impact H1N1 and H3N2 swine flu viruses regularly occur among pig populations in the United States. Swine flu is something that the industry deals with routinely. History of Swine Flu Virus Circulation in Pigs H1N1 swine viruses have been known to circulate among pig populations since at least 1930. H3N2 influenza viruses did not begin circulating among pigs in the United States until about 1998. The H3N2 viruses initially were introduced into the pig population from humans. However, since then the H3N2 viruses circulating in pigs have changed. The H3N2 viruses circulating in pigs now are very different from the seasonal H3N2 viruses that circulate in humans.

Members now have a set of new and updated tools from the AAFP to assist them in educating patients about the importance of receiving an influenza vaccine. These resources include a brief guide to making effective vaccination recommendations, as well as a clinical fact sheet and a quick reference. To support their recommendations, physicians can refer to evidence-based handouts and articles created specifically for patients as part of these updates. Tools for Family Physicians Members have access to the new and updated clinical resources, which are supported by an unrestricted grant from Seqirus USA Inc., on the AAFP’s Immunizations and Vaccines webpage. The Making a Strong Flu Vaccine Recommendation resource explains in a single page how, why and when to recommend that patients receive an influenza vaccine. Sample dialogue illustrates ways to implement each element of the SHARE (Share, Highlight, Address, Remind and Explain) method for making strong recommendations: Share why the flu vaccine is right for the patient. Highlight positive experiences to reaffirm the advantages and build confidences in flu vaccination. Address questions and issues patients may have, such as side effects, safety concerns and the shot’s efficacy. Remind patients that flu vaccinations prevent major illness, which can lead to hospitalization or even death for some people. Explain the possible consequences of contracting the flu, including health effects, missed job or family obligations, financial impacts and the possibility of infecting susceptible family members and friends. A Clinician Quick Reference Influenza Vaccination Guide has been updated with the latest recommendations for the 2023-2024 flu season, including dosages, patient ages, contraindications and precautions. An Influenza Vaccination Fact Sheet corrects several misconceptions about flu vaccines and summarizes key facts from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices related to vaccine acceptance, co-administration with other vaccines, vaccine composition, vaccine timing, older adults and egg allergies. Tools for Patients New and updated resources on familydoctor.org's Influenza Health Hub, which are supported by an unrestricted grant from AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP., have easy-to-understand, evidence-based information for patients that include questions they should ask their physicians. The Complete Guide to Flu Vaccines summarizes differences between the various types of vaccines that are available and how flu vaccines protect communities. Flu Myths debunks 14 common misconceptions about the flu and influenza vaccines. Flu Risks and Chronic Conditions details conditions than can put people at high risk for complications from influenza and explains vaccine safety.

Medscape Medical News Medbrief Severe Flu Confers Higher Risk for Neuro Disorders vs COVIDEve Bender March 22, 2024 00TOPLINE:Hospitalization for influenza is linked to a greater risk for subsequent neurologic disorders including migraine, stroke, or epilepsy than hospitalization for COVID-19, results of a large study show.METHODOLOGY:Researchers used healthcare claims data to compare 77,300 people hospitalized with COVID-19 with 77,300 hospitalized with influenza. The study did not include individuals with long COVID.In the final sample of 154,500 participants, the mean age was 51 years, and more than half (58%) were female.Investigators followed participants from both cohorts for a year to find out how many of them had medical care for six of the most common neurologic disorders: Migraine, epilepsy, stroke, neuropathy, movement disorders, and dementia.If participants had one of these neurologic disorders prior to the original hospitalization, the primary outcome involved subsequent healthcare encounters for the neurologic diagnosis.TAKEAWAY:Participants hospitalized with COVID-19 vs influenza were significantly less likely to require care in the following year for migraine (2% vs 3.2%), epilepsy (1.6% vs 2.1%), neuropathy (1.9% vs 3.6%), movement disorders (1.5% vs 2.5%), stroke (2% vs 2.4%), and dementia (2% vs 2.3%) (all P < .001).After adjusting for age, sex, and other health conditions, researchers found that people hospitalized with COVID-19 had a 35% lower risk of receiving care for migraine, a 22% lower risk of receiving care for epilepsy, and a 44% lower risk of receiving care for neuropathy than those with influenza. They also had a 36% lower risk of receiving care for movement disorders, a 10% lower risk for stroke (all P < .001), as well as a 7% lower risk for dementia (P = .0007).In participants who did not have a preexisting neurologic condition at the time of hospitalization for either COVID-19 or influenza, 2.8% hospitalized with COVID-19 developed one in the next year compared with 5% of those hospitalized with influenza.IN PRACTICE:"While the results were not what we expected to find, they are reassuring in that we found being hospitalized with COVID did not lead to more care for common neurologic conditions when compared to being hospitalized with influenza," study investigator Brian C. Callaghan, MD, of University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, said in a press release.SOURCE:Adam de Havenon, MD, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, led the study, which was published online on March 20 in Neurology.LIMITATIONS:The study relied on ICD codes in health claims databases, which could introduce misclassification bias. Also, by selecting only individuals who had associated hospital-based care, there may have been a selection bias based on disease severity.DISCLOSURES:The study was funded by the American Academy of Neurology. De Havenon reported receiving consultant fees from Integra and Novo Nordisk and royalty fees from UpToDate and has equity in TitinKM and Certus. Callaghan consulted for DynaMed and performs medical legal consultations including consultations for the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.

Experts say these viruses appear to be sticking around as the U.S. approaches warmer months.Influenza: Is the flu still around?Spring may be around the corner but the flu – specifically, influenza B – is surging.While samples of influenza A have decreased since the wintertime peak, influenza B has been detected in 96% of samples, so far, in March compared with 66% of samples in February, according to WastewaterSCAN data.While it’s normal for influenza A and B to peak at different times during the year, Wolfe noted that influenza B was nearly nonexistent last year.Although it’s difficult to pinpoint why, experts speculate patterns were disrupted by social distancing and other mitigation measures taken to prevent the spread of disease during the pandemic. During this time, viruses weren't circulating normally because people stayed home and wore masks, impeding the transmission of COVID-19 and other contagious viruses. The reappearance of this influenza B peak suggests common viruses in the U.S. may be returning to a more reliable, seasonal pattern, Wolfe said. Parainfluenza: What is it?Human parainfluenza viruses, or parainfluenza, has also peaked a few times this season, Wolfe said.The virus – which causes respiratory symptoms such as fever, runny nose, cough, sneezing and sore throat – saw its highest surge in November last year and is seeing another sizeable peak that began in mid-February and has yet to come down.WastewaterSCAN detected the virus in 55% of all samples nationwide, particularly in the Midwest, Northeast and South. The West is also experiencing an increase but not as significant as in other regions. The wastewater data is consistent with clinical data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which shows positive tests for parainfluenza type 3 are on the rise. Sheree Piperidis, a clinical professor of physician assistant studies at Quinnipiac University, says she’s seeing more cases in doctor’s offices.Human parainfluenza viruses most commonly cause respiratory infections in infants and young children, according to the CDC. Symptoms are typically mild and children usually can recover on their own at home.In some cases, parainfluenza can cause more severe diseases, including croup, bronchitis and pneumonia.With croup, the virus infects the vocal cords, windpipe and bronchial tubes, Piperidis said. Children between 2 and 5 are more likely to develop these severe disease symptoms compared with other age groups.There is no vaccine or antiviral that treats parainfluenza.Stomach flu or bug: NorovirusNorovirus, often called the stomach flu or bug, is also on the rise nationally, Wolfe said, riding out a peak that began in early March.The virus is the leading cause of foodborne illnesses in the U.S. and accounts for 58% of cases annually. Experts say food typically becomes contaminated by infected people through preparation, not during the growing, harvesting, or manufacturing processes.The CDC reports about 2,500 norovirus outbreaks in the U.S. every year. Outbreaks tend to occur between November and April but in years when there’s a new viral strain, there can be up to 50% more illness.Norovirus causes over 100,000 hospitalizations and 900 deaths annually, mostly affecting adults 65 and older. It’s also responsible for nearly a million medical care visits for children.The most common symptoms of the illness are diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and stomach pain. Without available vaccines or antivirals, experts say prevention is the key to staying healthy. Here are their tips:◾ Wash your hands well with soap and water after using the toilet or changing diapers; before eating, preparing, or handling food; before touching common surfaces; and before caring for people who are sick. The CDC says hand sanitizers can be used in addition to washing your hands with soap and water, but the solution doesn’t work well against norovirus and shouldn’t be substituted for handwashing.◾ Handle and prepare food safely by washing fruits and vegetables well, cooking oysters and other shellfish thoroughly and routinely cleaning and sanitizing kitchen utensils and surfaces. It’s important to remember that norovirus is relatively resistant to heat and survives temperatures as high as 145 degrees Fahrenheit.◾ Prevent spread while camping or hiking by drinking and cooking with only clean water; keeping food away from bathroom areas, preparing and cooking food properly and washing your hands with soap and water.Norovirus: Symptoms and prevention of 'stomach flu'When norovirus cases spike, these are symptoms you should watch out for, and measures you can take for prevention.Rotavirus: What parents should knowAnother stomach virus on the rise during the warmer months is rotavirus, which primarily affects infants and young children.Wastewater data shows rotavirus began appearing at low levels in September but has been increasing to the high levels recently, Wolfe said.While it’s possible to get sick any time during the year, cases are more common in the winter and spring. The rotavirus also used to follow a biennial pattern where cases would peak every other year, typically on even number years like 2024.But as with influenza B, the trend for rotavirus was altered during the past few years by the COVID-19 pandemic, said Jeff Goad, professor of pharmacy practice and associate dean of Chapman University’s School of Pharmacy"It used to be more predictable," said Goad, who is also president-elect of the National Foundation of Infectious Diseases. "Eventually, we'll get into a stable pattern and we're already starting to see that."Rotavirus commonly causes severe watery diarrhea and vomiting in infants and young children, which can lead to serious dehydration. In these cases, children often need to be hospitalized. Each year, the CDC says rotavirus leads to more than 200,000 emergency room visits and up to 70,000 hospitalizations in children under 5.People at greatest risk are young, unvaccinated children between 3 months and 3 years old. The rotavirus vaccine effectively protects 70% of children from the disease and 90% from its severest symptoms.Adrianna Rodriguez is a health reporter for the USA TODAY nation team.

Patrik Slezak / iStock Details about the case were reported in Vietnamese media reports translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease news blog. An official statement on the case from provincial health officials was translated and posted by FluTrackers, an inflection disease news message board. Khanh Hoa is on Vietnam's southeastern coast. Man hospitalized in serious condition The patient's symptoms began on March 11, and he returned home a few days later, where he stayed with his mother and sister while seeking medical care. When his symptoms worsened, he was hospitalized at a regional hospital. Soon after, he was transferred to Khanh Hoa provincial hospital where healthcare workers collected samples and sent them to the Pasteur Institute in Nha Trang, which revealed the H5 influenza virus. The man is hospitalized in serious condition and in isolation at the Provincial Hospital of Tropical Diseases. Health officials are monitoring contacts, including family members, health workers, and university students. So far, the subtype isn't known, but a few human cases involving older and recent H5N1 virus clades have been reported over the past few years, and China and Laos have reported H5N6 infections. The reports didn't say how the patient likely contracted the virus. US flu activity declines, along with other respiratory viruses News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Influenza, General COVID-19 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Flu activity finally declined last week following a lengthy post-holiday bump, though levels are still elevated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its latest weekly FluView report. NIAID/Flickr cc In its weekly respiratory virus snapshot, the CDC said indicators of COVID and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) also declined. For all three viruses, test positivity and emergency department visits declined last week. Nine jurisdictions reported high or very high activity, down from 17 the previous week. Flu up slightly in Pacific Northwest For flu, activity decreased or was stable in nine regions but increased slightly in the Pacific Northwest. Of respiratory samples that were positive for flu at public health labs, 64.6% were influenza A, and of subtyped influenza A viruses, 56.1% were H3N2, and 43.9% were 2009 H1N1. Hospitalizations have been declining since January, and overall deaths also trended downward. However, the CDC reported five more pediatric flu deaths, raising the total to 121 for the season. Two were due to H1N1, and three involved influenza B. COVID wastewater detections decline to low level In its latest COVID data updates, most indicators show a continuing steady decline, though deaths were level. Wastewater detections of SARS-CoV-2 are now classified as low. Levels are still highest in the south, but they have declined steeply in recent weeks. Study finds bivalent COVID vaccine not tied to stroke risk News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 libre de droit / iStock Earlier this week in JAMA, researchers published data on the risk of stroke among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older in the immediate weeks following a bivalent (two-strain) COVID-19 vaccine dose, finding no significantly elevated risk during the first 6 weeks following injection. The study comes a year after reports appeared in the US Vaccine Safety Datalink showing that during the immediate period (1 to 21 days) after vaccination, older adults were suffering more strokes if they received both the Pfizer bivalent COVID vaccine and a high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccine on the same day. The authors used Medicare recipient data to estimate the risk among those who received either the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 bivalent vaccine, concomitant (same-day) administration of either brand of COVID vaccine plus a high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine, and a high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine within the first 1 to 21-day or 22-to-42-day risk window compared with the 43-to-90-day control window. Adjuvanted vaccines include a substance that boosts immune response. Possible stroke risk with high-dose flu vaccine The study included 5,397,278 Medicare beneficiaries who received either brand of the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine (median age 74 years; 56% were women), 11,001 of whom had a stroke during the study period. The authors found no significant association for stroke with either COVID vaccine, but same-day administration of either brand and a high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccine was associated with an elevated risk of stroke. The observed association between vaccination and stroke in the concomitant subgroup was likely driven by a high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccination. "The current study additionally found an association that was small in magnitude between stroke and administration of a high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccine when the vaccine was administered without concomitant administration of either brand of the COVID-19 bivalent vaccine," the authors concluded. "This finding suggests that the observed association between vaccination and stroke in the concomitant subgroup was likely driven by a high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccination.” Scientists caution about CDC guidance on over-the-counter drugs for COVID-19 News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 miflippo / iStock In its most recent guidelines on the use of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs for COVID-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that mildly ill patients can relieve symptoms such as fever and sore throat with acetaminophen or ibuprofen, but a team led by Florida Atlantic University (FAU) researchers says it's not that simple.. In a review in the American Journal of Medicine, the investigators conclude that the decision to take acetaminophen (eg, Tylenol), aspirin, or ibuprofen (eg, Motrin, Advil) should be done on an individual basis under the guidance of a clinician. This is because the drugs aren't risk-free, with overuse of acetaminophen tied to irreversible liver damage, liver failure, the need for liver transplant, and kidney damage, the authors noted. While aspirin's anti-inflammatory properties may be useful in treating moderate to severe COVID-19, it carries the risk of bleeding, especially in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This is of particular concern in COVID-19, which may itself lead to bleeding and clotting abnormalities. Patient profile should guide decision, authors say Compared with aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen (eg, Aleve), and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have greater adverse-event profiles, namely for gastroenteritis (inflammation of the GI tract) and peptic ulcers. As with acetaminophen, long-term use of these drugs can lead to liver and kidney toxicity. We believe that health care providers should make individual clinical judgments for each of his or her patients in the selection of OTC drugs to treat symptoms of COVID-19. Charles Hennekens, MD, DrPH "Further, NSAIDs do not confer the cardiovascular benefits of aspirin," the authors wrote. "Since NSAIDs may induce a procoagulant state, the risks of thrombotic and thromboembolic events that can occur with a COVID-19 infection suggests that aspirin may have more beneficial effects in patients with acute COVID-19 infection." They added that national guidelines should be based on evidence from large randomized trials and directed only to clinicians. "We believe that health care providers should make individual clinical judgments for each of his or her patients in the selection of OTC drugs to treat symptoms of COVID-19," senior author Charles Hennekens, MD, DrPH, of FAU, said in a university news release. "This judgement should be based on the entire benefit to risk profile of the patient." Quick takes: Polio in Pakistan, yellow fever in the Americas, intranasal RSV vaccine trial News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Polio Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Yellow Fever Pakistan reported two wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases this week, marking its first of 2024. Both patients experienced paralysis onset in February and are from Balochistan province, which has been one of the country's hot spots, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) said in its latest weekly update. Also, the country reported 21 more environmental detections of the virus, including 5 in Balochistan, 11 in Sindh, 3 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 1 each in Islamabad and Punjab. Elsewhere, four countries reported more cases involving circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2: Guinea, Mali, Somalia, and Yemen. Three countries in the Americas have reported a total of seven yellow fever cases this year, according to an update yesterday from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Of the seven cases, four were fatal. Countries reporting cases include Colombia, which confirmed three cases, all fatal, in people from different cities in Putumayo department in the south. Guyana reported two cases in people who worked at the same logging camp near the border with Brazil. Peru noted two confirmed case-patients in different departments. Both had been exposed to wooded or wild areas in their agricultural work. In a related development, Brazil reported detections in nonhuman primates. For comparison, four countries reported 41 cases in 2023. PAHO said the risk in the Americas remains high, because impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic have led to gaps in vaccine coverage. Blue Lake Biotechnology, a US-based vaccine company, yesterday announced promising preliminary findings from a phase 1/2a clinical trial of its intranasal vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in young children. In a press release, the company said the vaccine, called BLB201, is immunogenic and well tolerated, with no significant safety signals after a single intranasal dose. The trial is under way in seropositive children ages 18 to 59 months old. The company is currently enrolling seronegative and seropositive kids as young as 8 months old in the ongoing trial. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the company fast-track designation for the vaccine. The vaccine encodes the RSV F protein and uses a proprietary parainfluenza virus 5 vector, not known to cause human disease.

In-depth mechanisms on how co-infections impact anti-viral immunity are lacking, but are highly relevant to treatment and prevention. We established a mouse model of co-infection with unrelated viruses, influenza A (IAV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV), causing disease in different organ systems. SFV infection eight days before IAV infection results in prolonged IAV replication, elevated cytokine/chemokine levels and exacerbated lung pathology. This is associated with impaired lung IAV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, stemming from suboptimal CD8+ T cell activation and proliferation in draining lymph nodes, and dendritic cell paralysis. Prior SFV infection leads to increased blood brain barrier permeability and presence of IAV RNA in brain, associated with increased trafficking of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells and establishment of long-term tissue-resident memory. Relative to lung IAV-specific CD8+ T cells, brain memory IAV-specific CD8+ T cells have increased TCR repertoire diversity within immunodominant DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ responses, featuring suboptimal TCR clonotypes. Overall, our study demonstrates that infection with an unrelated neurotropic virus perturbs IAV-specific immune responses and exacerbates IAV disease. Our work provides key insights into therapy and vaccine regimens directed against unrelated pathogens.

The reality is that we can harbour more than one infection at any given time, in sequence or concurrently, which can substantially affect immune responses to subsequent infection or vaccination. Co-infections with two or more pathogens can occur simultaneously or sequentially, by the same or different routes of transmission. In general, co-infections have a negative effect on human health leading to exacerbation of disease1. Viral co-infections can increase the variability of anti-viral immune responses, reduce protection and enhance immunopathology2. However, differences in immune mechanisms between single infection and co-infection, and the universal burden of viral co-infection on human health remain elusive.Influenza is a global health concern, causing annual epidemics and sporadic pandemics3. The past 50 years have seen the emergencee-emergence of epidemic arthropod-borne viral (arboviral) diseases on a global scale, with several arboviruses capable of infecting the central nervous system (CNS)4. Given the widespread prevalence of both influenza and arboviruses, the likelihood of co-infection with these viruses is high. There are limited data on whether co-infection of influenza A (IAV) with non-respiratory viruses affects disease outcome. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, influenza-dengue (DENV) co-infections were reported5,6, and identified as a risk factor for severe disease7. Previous co-infection studies involving influenza and herpes virus, reported that in a mouse model, co-infection with these viruses results in alleviated respiratory symptoms due to influenza infection8.As most studies investigate adaptive immune responses in a single pathogen model, immune responses during co-infections are understudied. Our knowledge of immune responses during viral co-infections is limited and understanding of interactions within the network of site-specific and systemic immune processes is lacking9. Of widespread relevance is the effect that one virus infection has on generation of immune responses to a second virus infection during both acute and memory phases. Importantly, in-depth data on immune responses to respiratory viruses during co-infection with unrelated pathogens are lacking.Here, we comprehensively defined how IAV-specific anti-viral immune responses are modulated by prior infection with the unrelated neurotropic arbovirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV). We established a mouse model to study sequential infection with two unrelated viruses in two key tissues, the lung and the brain. Our data show that sequential-infection (SFV→IAV) results in trafficking of IAV-specific T cells from the lung to the brain, elevated cytokine levels and altered viral replication kinetics in the lungs. Prior SFV infection leads to perturbed proliferation of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells, and ultimately results in impaired immunological memory formation and recall responses. Detailed analysis of TCR repertoires within DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ clonotypes in the lung and brain revealed a significant increase in clonotype diversity during SFV→IAV infection, indicating a more heterogenous response. Collectively, our study indicates that SFV→IAV sequentially infected animals have more severe respiratory disease and perturbed immune responses than mice infected with IAV alone.ResultsPrior infection with non-respiratory SFV leads to exacerbated influenza diseaseTo define the impact of prior infection with an unrelated non-respiratory virus on influenza virus infection, we established a mouse model of sequential viral co-infection using two well-characterised animal disease models: (i) neurotropic arboviral SFV infection, and (ii) respiratory IAV infection. SFV is a well-studied tractable model of experimental viral encephalitis10. In mice, the virus is 100% neuroinvasive following intraperitoneal injection and does not require intracranial inoculation as is the case with many other encephalitic viruses. SFV easily infects common strains of laboratory mice, and rodents may be its natural host. This negates the need for IFNAR-/- mice used to study some other neurotropic viruses, for example flaviviruses11. SFV infection in mice has a considerable body of supporting previous research and provides a well-regarded experimental system to study the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis. Adult C57BL/6 mice were infected with either 104 pfu A/HKx31 (x31) IAV alone via the intranasal (i.n.) route, leading to localised respiratory infection; or 5×103 pfu A7(74) SFV via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route, which establishes systemic infection prior to neuroinvasion12. In a third group, SFV infection was followed by i.n. IAV infection on day 8 post-SFV (SFV→IAV sequential infection) (Fig. 1a). Day 8 was chosen as adaptive immune responses are at their peak and infectious SFV is generally cleared from the brain around this time13,14.Fig. 1: SFV→IAV sequential infection exacerbates respiratory disease.a Mice were infected i.p. with 5 × 103 pfu A7(74) SFV followed 8 days later with 104 pfu A/HKx31 (i.n.). Brain, lungs and spleens were harvested at various days post-infection (dpi). b Lung IAV viral titres were determined by a plaque assay on MDCK cells. Each symbol denotes an individual mouse (d3 IAV n = 5, SFV→IAV n = 5; d5 IAV n = 5, SFV→IAV n = 5; d7 IAV n = 10, SFV→IAV n = 10). c Lung homogenates and sera were assayed by LEGENDplex to determine the cumulative amount of total cytokines and chemokines present and the amounts of each cytokine.

Gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. S5a–c. Significance was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageViral, inflammatory and immunological analyses were performed following either IAV alone or sequential SFV→IAV infection during acute and long-term time-points following IAV infection. Mice were monitored for IAV replication and inflammation in the infected lungs. Analysis of IAV lung viral titres by a plaque assay15 clearly demonstrated that mice exposed to SFV prior to IAV had distorted kinetics of IAV viral replication in the lungs (Fig. 1b). Initially on day (d) 3 after IAV infection, SFV→IAV animals had significantly lower lung viral titres compared to IAV-only mice, but by d7 their lung viral titres were higher. We also found higher levels of lung cytokines/chemokines in the SFV→IAV group relative to IAV-only group at d7 after IAV infection (Fig. 1c), suggesting exacerbated and prolonged IAV disease. SFV-only infection elicited negligible cytokine responses in lung or serum compared to other experimental groups. Elevated inflammatory mediators included IL-6, IL-1β, IFNγ and MCP-1, a signature associated with severe and fatal influenza disease in humans16,17. IFNγ levels were also significantly upregulated in the serum of SFV→IAV animals (Fig. 1c). Thus, SFV infection predisposes to elevated cytokine storm following subsequent IAV infection, both at the site of infection and systemically. It also leads to higher IAV titres in the lungs at a later stage of infection.In agreement with the lung viral load and cytokine data, histopathological analysis of lung tissue from IAV alone and SFV→IAV mice revealed more extensive histopathological changes in the sequentially infected group (Fig. 1d). These included multifocal areas of alveolar interstitial lymphocytic and macrophage infiltration, numerous alveolar macrophages, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, severe lymphocytic vasculitis and perivascular cuffing, and bronchial/bronchiolar epithelial degenerationecrosis and hyperplasia accompanied by multifocal haemorrhage (Fig. 1d). Overall, lung damage in SFV→IAV group was more extensive than in the IAV alone group (Fig. 1e). SFV-only infection did not cause detectable histopathological changes in the lungs (Figs. 1d and e).To understand immune responses during sequential SFV→IAV infection, we performed a broad analysis of myeloid and B cell compartments in lungs, spleen and brain on d7 after IAV infection or SFV infection (Fig. 1f). We found similar numbers of B cells (B220+CD19+) and antibody-secreting cells (ASC, IgD-B220loCD138+) across all tissues examined. Similarly, comparable numbers of neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6G+), macrophages (CD11b+CD64+), DCs (CD11c+) and inflammatory monocytes (CD11b+Ly6C+) were detected across the experimental groups. However, it is plausible that although B cell responses did not differ quantitatively, they could differ qualitatively. B cells from co-infected mice could have different activation status, produced antibodies of lower affinity resulting in impaired affinity maturation, and there could have been differences in the rate of class-switching and numbers of neutralising IgM and IgG antibodies, which could further affect seroconversion and seroprotection rates.SFV→IAV sequential infection perturbs activation and trafficking of IAV-specific T cellsTo investigate mechanisms underpinning exacerbated IAV disease severity in SFV→IAV mice, we performed in-depth immune analyses of T cell responses in lungs, brain and spleen. We examined total numbers of pan CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. S1b, c) and effector T cells. The striking and unexpected observation was that at d7, SFV→IAV animals had significantly increased numbers of activated effector CD62LloCD44hi CD4+ (Fig. 1f) and CD62LloCD44hi CD8+ T cells in the brain (Fig. 2a), although no differences were detected in the lungs or the spleen. To determine the specificity of the effector CD8+ T cells in the brain, we defined influenza-specific CD8+ T cells with peptide-MHC-I tetramers (DbNP366 and DbPA224; two immunodominant CD8+ T cell IAV epitopes in B6 mice18). In SFV→IAV mice, IAV-specific DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ T cells trafficked to the brain and were detected in 11/15 and 9/15 of mice, respectively (Fig. 2b). Strikingly, SFV→IAV-infected animals had significantly reduced numbers of DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ T cells in the lung and spleen (Fig. 2b), demonstrating that kinetics and anatomical distribution (trafficking) of IAV-specific immune responses were markedly perturbed by prior SFV infection. Conversely, of the very few CD8+ T cells infiltrating the brain in the IAV-only group, the majority (95.3%) were IAV tetramer-negative. We could minimally detect DbNP366+CD8+ T cells in 4 out of 15 mice and DbPA224+CD8+ T cells in 7/15 mice. While the numbers of activated CD4+ T cells mirrored those of activated CD8+ T cells, numbers of IAV-specific CD4+ T cells could not be investigated due to poor performance of class II tetramers.Fig. 2: SFV→IAV sequential infection perturbs influenza-specific CD8+ T cell responses.a Absolute numbers of activated (CD44+CD62Llo) CD8+ T cells across different anatomical sites in naïve (n = 5), SFV (n = 14), IAV (n = 15) and SFV→IAV (n = 14) infected mice.

Following the cognate peptide stimulation, IFNγ-secreting CD8+ T cells were found in the brains of SFV mono-infected mice, but not in the brains of mice infected with IAV only. Interestingly, in the SFV→IAV group, IFNγ was produced in response to stimulation with either IAV- or SFV-specific peptides, confirming the presence of IAV-specific T cells in the brain of mice previously exposed to neurotropic SFV.To investigate the activation profile of CD8+ T cells, we examined key T cell activation markers (CD25, CD38, KLRG1, PD-1) on total CD8+ T cells and IAV tetramer+CD8+ T cells from lungs, brain and spleen of IAV-infected and co-infected mice (Fig. 2d). In the brain, we found significantly higher frequencies of CD8+ T cells expressing effector KLRG1+ or PD-1+ molecules in the IAV only group (Fig. 2e). Conversely, SFV→IAV animals showed higher frequencies of brain CD8+ T cells displaying activated CD38+, CD38+CD25+ and CD38+PD-1+ phenotypes. In line with these findings, analysis of IAV tetramer-specific CD8+ T cells also demonstrated that both DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ cells in the IAV-only group had significantly higher expression of the typical effector CD25 phenotype, whereas the SFV→IAV group had higher frequencies of CD38+ DbNP366+CD8+ and CD38+PD-1+ DbPA224+CD8+ T cells. Thus, it is evident that activation profiles of brain IAV-specific CD8+ T cells are quite distinct in mice with prior SFV infection (predominantly driven by CD38 expression) compared to a typical effector phenotype of CD8+ T cells depicted by KLRG1, CD25 and PD-1 in IAV-only infected mice.In the lung, the activation phenotype of CD8+ T cells was comparable between SFV→IAV and IAV-only groups, with the exception of increased expression of the KLRG1+PD-1+ phenotype in DbPA224+CD8+ T cells in the IAV-only group (Fig. 2e). There were no differences in the activation phenotypes of CD8+ T cells found in spleen of IAV-only and sequentially infected mice.Increased clonotypic diversity of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells during SFV→IAV sequential infectionThe diversity and composition of T cell receptor (TCR)-αβ clonotypes within virus-specific CD8+ T cell populations substantially impacts functionality, immunodominance and protective efficacy of CD8+ T cells19,20. To understand TCRαβ signatures of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells trafficking to the brain, relative to typical TCRαβ clonotypes of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells trafficking to the infected lungs21,22,23, we dissected the TCRαβ repertoire diversity and clonal composition using ex vivo tetramer staining and single-cell TCRαβ multiplex RT-PCR24. To the best of our knowledge, TCRαβ analysis of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells in the brain has not been previously reported. We analysed TCRαβ repertoires of IAV-specific DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ T cells obtained from lungs and brains of SFV→IAV or IAV-only infected mice on d30 after IAV infection.It is well-established that in the lungs of IAV-infected mice, both DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ T cell populations have strong biases towards specific TRBV gene segments, and to a lesser extent, towards TRAV gene elements. DbPA224+CD8+ TCRs in IAV-infected B6 mice display a bias towards TRAV6 and TRBV29 gene segments, whereas DbNP366+CD8+ TCRs predominantly utilise TRAV16 and TRBV1323,25. TCRβ repertoire within DbNP366+CD8+ T cells in IAV-infected mice is restricted and utilises public (shared across multiple mice) TCRβ signatures, especially TRBV13.1-CDR3β regions with prominent S/R/A/K GGA, GGS or GGG motifs21. In contrast, TCRβ repertoire within DbPA224+CD8+ T cell responses is diverse and private in nature (TCR clonotypes are not shared across the mice), although still use strong TRBV29 motifs23,25.In our study, we validated the dominant TRBV and TRAV usage for both DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ T cell populations in lungs of IAV-infected mice (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Tables 1–3). Using the TCRdist pipeline26 for modelling of amino acid motifs (Figs. 3a, S2a,S3a and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), we found strong TRBV13.1 bias with prominent public CDR3β motifs S/R/A/K GGA, GGS or GGG within DbNP366+CD8+ repertoires of IAV-infected mice, not only at the site of infection, but also in the brain. This provides evidence that the optimal public DbNP366+CD8+ TCRs can traffic to brain and establish memory pools at d30 following IAV infection (Fig. 3a). However, strikingly, it was apparent that DbNP366+CD8+ TCRαβ repertoire was more diverse in lungs and the brain of SFV→IAV sequentially infected mice, with the additional TRBV2-CDR3β DRRNS motif having a strong presence (Figs. 3a and 3c). TCRβ clonotypes with the TRBV2-CDR3β DRRNS motif generally play a very minor role in DbNP366+CD8+ TCR repertoire in IAV-infected B6 mice, largely dominated by TRBV13.1 public clonotypes. Interestingly, however, we have previously detected a strong presence of DbNP366+CD8+ clonotypes with the TRBV2-CDR3β DRRNS motif in A7 mice characterised by its fixed OT-I TCR-alpha chain27. In that study, we also found that the DbNP366+CD8+ T cell responses with the dominant TRBV2-CDR3β DRRNS motif were suboptimal in terms of their function, as depicted by peptide-MHC-I avidity and cytokine production27. Our findings thus suggest that markedly elevated cytokine milieu and/or prolonged IAV viral load in SFV→IAV sequentially infected mice led to the recruitment of suboptimal DbNP366+CD8+ TCR clonotypes to both lungs and brain, alongside public optimal DbNP366+CD8+ TCR signatures. Interestingly, in SFV→IAV mice, we also observed an increased usage of clonotypes using TRBV17 gene for DbNP366+CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3c), which was previously reported as a dominant TRBV in the naïve DbNP366+CD8+ TCR repertoire, generally not recruited into the IAV-specific immune response23. Thus, our findings demonstrating recruitment of suboptimal and ‘naïve’ DbNP366+CD8+ TCR clonotypes following SFV→IAV sequential infection might, at least in part, explain delayed viral control in SFV→IAV mice capable of recruiting TCR clonotypes of suboptimal functionality.Fig. 3: Increased TCRαβ repertoire clonotypic diversity of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells during SFV→IAV sequential infection.TCR representation of CDR3β sequence motifs within (a) DbNP366+CD8+ T cells and (b) DbPA224+CD8+ T cells in the lungs and brains of IAV and SFV → IAV mice.

Significance was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageSimilar findings were observed for diverse and private DbPA224+CD8+ TCR repertoire. For DbPA224+CD8+ TCR clonotypes in the lung, TRBV29 was the dominant gene segment within TCRβ for both IAV-only and SFV→IAV sequentially infected mice (Fig. 3b). The SFV→IAV mice had, however, increased diversity within TRBV segments (Fig. 3c) and within the TRBV29-CDR3β motif (Fig. 3b). In the lung, DbPA224+CD8+ TCRs in the IAV group showed a bias towards TRAV6 and TRAV12, the latter also shown to be a dominant TCRα chain28. However, in SFV→IAV mice, DbPA224+CD8+ TCRs clearly demonstrated a more diverse TRBV pairing with a broad range of TRAV segments (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Tables 1 and 3). TRAV6 and TRAV6/DV9 usage by DbPA224+CD8+ T cells was more pronounced at the expense of TRAV12 usage. Similar to what we observed for DbNP366+CD8+ TCRs, DbPA224+CD8+ repertoire was also more diverse in the brain compared to lungs. While there was still a bias towards TRBV29 for DbPA224+CD8+ TCRs in IAV-only group, TRBV usage was more heterogenous in the brain compared to that in lungs.We also used Simpson’s Diversity Index (SDI) to define diversity of CDR3α and CDR3β chain sequences in the brain and lungs for DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ TCRs (Fig. 3d). The SDI results verified significantly greater diversity of DbPA224+CD8+ TRAV and TRBV segments in the brain of SFV→IAV sequentially infected group as well as IAV-only group (CDR3β only). In addition, the DbPA224+CD8+ TRBV compartment in the brain showed greater diversity in SFV → IAV than IAV-only.Overall, our data demonstrated that while a substantial proportion of DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ TCRαβ repertoires within SFV→IAV sequentially infected mice have prototypical TCRαβ signatures of IAV-only infected mice, additional TCRαβ clonotypes are recruited after SFV→IAV infection, especially in the brain, with more extensive pairing of TRAV and TRBV. This in turn indicates a more heterogenous IAV-specific CD8+ T cell response following prior SFV infection, which however encompassed suboptimal TCRαβ clonotypes with diminished functions.IAV-specific T cell trafficking to the brainTo investigate the mechanisms underpinning increased trafficking of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells to the brain in SFV→IAV mice, we first assessed the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB) using Evans Blue Dye extravasation method29,30. The BBB is often compromised during infection and inflammation of the CNS31. Inflammatory cytokines associated with viral infections can increase permeability of the BBB32. Extraneural SFV infection is well-documented to disrupt the BBB33. To investigate the integrity of the BBB in our dual infection system, Evans Blue Dye was i.p. injected at predefined time-points post-infection. After 3 hrs, mice were culled, the brain vasculature perfused and brain dye levels determined. In agreement with a previous study, BBB permeability was significantly increased by SFV (i.p.) infection (Fig. 4a). Surprisingly, IAV infection also affected BBB permeability. While the changes were greatest for each infection at d5, both infections also showed increased permeability as early as d3 and remained permeable at d7. Mice were then infected with IAV (i.n.) on d7 post-SFV infection. Interestingly, a day later we found a significant increase in BBB permeability, which continued the second day, although at reduced magnitude. These SFV-induced BBB changes could be facilitating IAV and CD8+ T cell entry into the brain.Fig. 4: Factors driving IAV-specific T cell trafficking to the brain.a Evans blue (EB) extravasation assay in mice infected with either SFV or IAV or SFV→IAV co-infected, compared to naïve controls. EB was injected i.p. on different days, brains were perfused and harvested 3 h post-injection. EB concentration was measured spectrophotometrically in brain homogenates and determined using a standard curve. Data from 2 independent experiments were normalised to naïve controls and plotted, error bar represents SEM (d3: SFV n = 10, IAV n = 10; d5: SFV n = 10, IAV n = 8; d7: SFV n = 10, IAV n = 9; d7 + 1: SFV → IAV n = 10; d7 + 2: SFV → IAV n = 10; d7 + 3: SFV → IAV n = 4). b Mice were infected i.p. with 5 × 103 pfu A7(74) SFV. 1 x 106 naïve or in vitro activated CD8+ OT-I T cells were adoptively transferred i.v. to 7 days after infection SFV mice and uninfected mice. D1 post transfer all mice were infected i.n. with 1x104 pfu A/x31-OVA. Brain, lungs, and spleen were collected at 7 days after infection.

Enriched OT-I CD8+ T cells were activated in vitro by co-culturing for 4 days with SIINFEKL peptide-pulsed naïve splenocytes from a B6 mouse36. 1x106 of in vitro activated OT-I cells were transferred into naïve mice or mice previously infected with SFV on d7 post-infection. One day after the transfer, the recipient mice were infected with 1x104 pfu of either IAV-OVA or wild-type IAV. Organs were harvested on d7 after the IAV infection (Fig. 4b). CD8+ OT-I cells were detected in the brain and lungs of mice infected with the IAV-OVA (either single infection or sequential infection), but not in mice infected with IAV (wild-type X31; Fig. 4c), indicating that OT-I cells could traffic to the site where OVA antigen was likely present. We performed the same experiment using naïve (rather than in vitro activated) OT-I cells and demonstrated that OT-I cells also traffic to the brain of IAV-OVA and SFV→IAV-OVA infected animals but were absent in the IAV control group (Fig. S1f).Our findings indicate that OT-I cells specifically trafficked to the brain when their cognate OVA antigen was present in the mice. To determine whether IAV was present in the brain, we performed qPCR amplification of the IAV matrix (M) gene region in perfused brains. Our data indicate that IAV RNA was present in the brain of IAV and SFV→IAV infected mice during acute phase of infection (Fig. 4d). Expression of the virus M gene peaked on d5 and levels were higher in the brains of SFV→IAV mice than in those of IAV only mice. Interestingly, RNA expression kinetics mirrored the difference in viral kinetics observed in the lungs (Fig. 1b). Despite readily detectable IAV RNA level in the brain, we could not detect infectious virus by standard plaque assay, presumably due to low sensitivity of this method.It seems most likely that IAV and OVA-specific T-cells traffic to the brain as a result of the presence of these antigens in the brain. Our data indicate that prior SFV infection may have long-term effect on the integrity of BBB, and it also modulates subsequent brain and lung immune responses.Surface proteome analysis of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells in lungs and brainTo define in-depth characteristics of CD8+ T cells trafficking to different anatomical sites in IAV and IAV→SFV mice, we performed an extensive analysis of 253 cell surface antigens on OT-I cells following IAV-OVA infection with or without prior SFV infection. We utilised LEGENDscreen™ and OT-I system to perform immunoprofiling of CD8+ T cells. OT-I cells isolated from brain, lungs, and spleen of IAV-OVA-only infected and sequentially infected SFV→IAV-OVA mice were barcoded with anti-mouse CD45.1 antibodies, stained with CD8+ T cell backbone panel, and subsequently screened for the expression of 253 cell surface PE-labelled markers using flow cytometry (Fig. 5a). We then used the InfinityFlow pipeline to predict co-expression of individual PE-labelled markers37. Data from each well were combined with the information contained in the backbone panel to enable data imputation into a data matrix, in order to predict marker expression by CD8+ T cells.Fig. 5: Surface proteome analysis of CD8+ T cells migrating to the brain.a Schematic workflow for flow cytometric analysis of surface proteome. CD45.1+CD8+ T cells were enriched from the brain, lungs, and spleen of IAV-OVA and SFV → IAV-OVA infected mice, barcoded, stained with a CD8+ T cell focused backbone panel, then stained with phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated labelled antibodies for surface proteome expression with the LEGENDScreen kit (Biolegend), followed by individual expression analysis. b UMAP plot generated using InfinityFlow-predicted expression profiles for indicated populations in lungs OT-I CD8+ T cells from both SFV → IAV-OVA and IAV-OVA groups. c UMAP plot of OT-I CD8+ T cell subsets in the lungs generated using backbone markers from SFV → IAV-OVA (orange) and IAV-OVA (blue) groups. d Comparison of cell frequencies between SFV → IAV-OVA and IAV-OVA groups in different clusters identified by InfinityFlow. e Histogram representations of activation markers associated with CD8+ T cells: KLRG1, CX3CR1, CD43, integrin B7, CD11b and CD11c in Cluster 1 (terminal effectors). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageWe performed UMAP analysis of lung CD8+ T cells using markers from the backbone panel and identified five main clusters corresponding to 1) terminally differentiated effectors, 2) TRM/TEX-like, 3) TEFF1, 4) TCM-like and 5) TEFF2 cells (Fig. 5b)38. No major differences were observed between cells isolated from IAV-OVA or SFV→IAV-OVA infected animals in terms of phenotypes. However, when CD8+ T cells from each group were visualised on separate UMAPs (Fig. 5c), we found reduced frequency of terminally differentiated effector OT-I cells (cluster 1) within the SFV→IAV mice, resulting in an approximate ratio of 70:30 (IAV-OVA:SFV→IAV-OVA) (Fig. 5d). This corroborated our earlier findings (Fig. 3b), where we observed a significantly lower numbers of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells in the SFV→IAV group. To confirm the identification of OT-I cells in cluster 1, we scrutinised a number of cell surface markers associated with terminally differentiated effector T cells (KLRG1, CX3CR1, CD43, integrin B7, CD11b, and CD11c) and confirmed their markedly higher expression on OT-I cells in terminally differentiated cluster 1, compared to other clusters (Fig. 5e). Despite collating CD8+ T cells from 16 brains, we did not obtain sufficient CD8+ T cell numbers to allow meaningful comparisons between the two groups.Prior SFV infection induces paralysis of antigen presenting cells and consequently suboptimal proliferation of CD8+ T cellsOur data provide evidence that SFV→IAV sequentially infected mice have delayed IAV lung clearance (Fig. 1b), and reduced numbers of IAV-specific tetramer+CD8+ T cells in the lungs (Fig. 2b). To understand the underlying mechanisms governing differential activation and trafficking of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells, linked at least in part to delayed viral clearance, we sought to define proliferative capacity of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells. Impaired T cell activation and trafficking has been previously linked to the phenomenon of antigen-presenting cell (APC) paralysis39, resulting from an excessive production of immunomediators directed at restoration of homeostasis. Our data (Fig. 1c) showed markedly elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs of sequentially infected SFV→IAV animals. SFV could be detected in the lungs on day 3 post-infection, and we also detected the presence of SFV-specific CD8+ T cells in the lungs of mice exposed to SFV or SFV→IAV (Fig. 6a). Thus, we hypothesised that SFV causes APC paralysis, which could subsequently impact CD8+ T cells activation and proliferating capacity. To investigate the possibility of APC paralysis, we inoculated mice with either SFV, IAV or, as a control, with a Toll-like receptor agonist, CpG. The latter induces APC paralysis in the spleen39. Cell surface markers associated with APC paralysis (Ly6A, CD103, TGFβRII and PD-L140) were analysed on splenic DCs (Fig. 6b). Our data showed that SFV infection-induced upregulation of surface expression of Ly6A on splenic CD8+ DCs, a phenotype consistent with paralysis, akin to that induced by CpG (Fig. 6c).Fig. 6: SFV infection induces APC paralysis.a Lung SFV viral titres were determined by a plaque assay on Vero cells on d3, d5 and d7 (n = 8).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageAs impairment in APC antigen-presenting function can impact T cell activation and proliferation41, we investigated the impact of prior SFV infection on the proliferative capacity of IAV-specific T cells using the OT-I system. SFV-infected or naïve mice received 1x106 VPD450-labelled OT-I cells, and subsequently were infected with IAV-OVA at d1 after OT-I transfer (Fig. 6d). The proliferative capacity of OT-I cells was assessed on day 3.5 in the draining mediastinal lymph node (MLN), and numbers of OT-I cells in the lungs were assessed on day 4.5 post-IAV-OVA infection. Prior SFV infection impaired division of OT-I CD8+ T cells in the MLN relative to IAV-OVA infection alone (Fig. 6e). OT-I CD8+ T cells from the SFV→IAV-OVA group proliferated significantly slower than those from the IAV-OVA mice. The proportion of proliferating cells in early divisions (3-5) were significantly higher in the SFV→IAV-OVA group, while fewer OT-I cells underwent the 7+ divisions. This is consistent with suboptimal APC activation impacting their proliferative capacity (Fig. 6e). As a result, significantly reduced numbers of activated OT-I cells were present in the infected lungs in SFV→IAV-OVA mice at day 4.5 after IAV infection (Fig. 6f).Collectively, our findings provide clear evidence that prior infection with SFV can negatively affect the APC function and antigen presentation efficacy. This impairment in DC function subsequently led to suboptimal IAV-specific CD8+ T cell activation/division, reduced IAV-specific CD8+ T cell numbers trafficking to the infected lung, thus diminished protective capacity of IAV-specific CD8 + T cell responses following sequential SFV→IAV sequential-infection.Sequential SFV→IAV infection impacts IAV-specific CD8+ T cell memory formation and recall capacityGiven the impact of prior SFV infection on the activation and magnitude of a subsequent IAV CD8 T-cell response and on the resolution and pathology of the acute lung infection, we hypothesised that prior SFV infection also impairs establishment and long-term persistence of IAV-specific CD8+ memory T cells. In addition to IAV and SFV→IAV groups, we included IAV→SFV group in our experiments to determine whether the order of sequential infections has an effect on memory CD8+ T cells. Mice were initially i.n. infected with 104 pfu IAV (x31) or i.p. 5×103 pfu SFV (A7(74)), and then infected with a second virus 8 days later (Fig. 7a). Remarkably, ninety days after the second infection, we detected sizeable populations of IAV-specific memory CD8+ T cells of both specificities, DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ T cells, in the brains of all experimental groups (Fig. 7b). Tetramer+ CD8+ T cell numbers were significantly elevated in SFV→IAV group compared to mice infected with IAV only, but not in the IAV→SFV group (Fig. 7b). More specifically, we observed significantly lower numbers of TEM and TCM cells in the spleen of IAV→SFV sequentially infected mice, but higher numbers of TEM in the lungs of SFV→IAV group (Figs. 7c–e and S4a, b). Overall, memory tetramer+CD8+ T cell numbers in the lungs were comparable between IAV-only and SFV→IAV mice, which is in a stark contrast to the acute phase of influenza infection. There was also a significant reduction in tissue resident memory (TRM) CD69+CD103+CD8+ T cells in the lungs of the IAV→SFV co-infected group (Fig. 7f), and an apparent presence of IAV-specific CD69+CD103- and CD69+CD103+ TRM cells42 in the brain across all the experimental groups, regardless of modality of infection. SFV→IAV mice had significantly higher numbers of TRM cells compared to IAV-only group (Fig. 7f).Fig. 7: Impaired immunological memory formation following sequential infection.a Mice were infected i.p. with 5 × 103 pfu A7(74) SFV followed 8 days later with 104 pfu A/HKx31 (i.n.).

Mice were initially infected with either 104 pfu x31 H3N2 IAV (i.n.) or 5 × 103 pfu A7(74) SFV (i.p.), followed on d8 by infection with either i.p. SFV (IAV→SFV) or i.n. IAV (SFV→IAV), respectively (Fig. 8a). IAV-only group was used as a control. All primed mice were subjected to a subsequent i.n. infection with 103 pfu H1N1 PR8 at 100 days post-co-infection. At d5 following IAV-PR8 challenge, lung, brain and spleen tissues were harvested from all experimental groups. Viral loads in lungs were determined by plaque assay and cytokine levels measured by Legendplex. No differences were detected in either weight loss, lung virus titres or cytokine/chemokine milieu between the experimental groups (Fig. S4d–f), indicating that all groups could mount optimal recall IAV-specific tetramer+CD8+ T cell responses against the secondary PR8 IAV infection. However, a significant reduction of IAV-specific tetramer+CD8+ T cells was found in lungs of the [IAV→SFV]→PR8 group (Fig. 8b), relative to the [IAV]→PR8 control, while the [SFV→IAV]→PR8 group had comparable responses to the [IAV]→PR8 group. Remarkably, there was a significantly higher number of tetramer+CD8+ T cells in the brains of the [IAV]→PR8 group, compared to the [SFV→IAV]→PR8 or [IAV→SFV]→PR8 groups. Moreover, the magnitude of tetramer+CD8+ T cell recall response in the lungs was significantly lower in [IAV→SFV]→PR8 (Fig. 8c). Despite these differences, animals across all experimental groups displayed the same level of virus control in the lungs. Interestingly, brain CD8+ T cell recall responses were also significantly lower in the [SFV→IAV]→PR8 and [IAV→SFV]→PR8 groups when compared to the [IAV]→PR8 group (Fig. 8c).Fig. 8: Abolition of immunodominance hierarchy in sequentially infected mice.a Mice were infected i.p. with 5 × 103 pfu A7(74) SFV followed 8 days later with 104 pfu A/HKx31 (i.n.). Another group was infected with the same virus dosage, but in reverse order. IAV-only group has been included as control. On d100 after primary IAV infection mice were infected i.n. with 103 pfu A/PR/8/34 (PR8).

Significance was determined by ordinary two-way ANOVA test with Šídák’s multiple comparison. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageFollowing the primary IAV infection in C57BL/6 mice, DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ T cell responses are co-dominant, while DbNP366+CD8+ T cell responses numerically dominate following the secondary IAV infection18,43,44. This well-described immunodominance hierarchy following secondary IAV infection was apparent in [IAV]→PR8 and [SFV→IAV]→PR8 experimental groups in both lungs and brain (Fig. 8d). However, the immunodominance of DbNP366+CD8+ T cell responses was completely abolished in [IAV→SFV]→PR8 group, where lung and brain DbNP366+CD8+ T cell responses were numerically equivalent to DbPA224+CD8+ T cells. The overall frequencies of effector CD44hiCD62Llo tetramer+ CD8+ T cells were comparable in lungs, spleens and brain (Fig. 8e and S4c). However, the absolute numbers of activated CD44hiCD62Llo tetramer+ CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced in the lungs of [IAV→SFV]→PR8 group and in the brain of [SFV→IAV]→PR8 and [IAV→SFV]→PR8 groups (Fig. 8e).Overall, our findings demonstrate that SFV infection has long-term effects on IAV-specific CD8+ T cell memory generation and recall responses. This was particularly apparent in IAV→SFV, which affected both long-term memory and recall responses in the lungs. Yet, despite the overall reduction in magnitude and the abolition of immunodominance hierarchy, mice in the [IAV→SFV]→PR8 group did not show signs of exacerbated respiratory disease, at least up to d5 after infection. Moreover, our experiments show that the H1N1-x31 strain of IAV enters the brain, as evidenced by the presence of viral RNA and TRM CD8+ T cells, promoted by the presence of antigen in the non-lymphoid tissues45.DiscussionHumans are continuously exposed to multiple pathogens at any given time, and several studies suggest that co-infections with unrelated pathogens are a common event and can alter the progression of disease46. Yet, our understanding of consequences of co-infections remains rudimental. It has long been recognised, that viral respiratory infections predispose patients to bacterial infections, and these co-infections have a worse outcome than either of the single infection. Such co-infections have been particularly well documented for influenza47 and more recently SARS-CoV248. On the other hand, there is a paucity of data on co-infections with unrelated viruses, which are rarely being studied49,50. To comprehensively understand the complex nature of immune responses during viral co-infection, we established a mouse model to study sequential infections with two unrelated viruses in two key tissues, the lung and the brain. Influenza viruses and encephalitic viruses are co-endemic globally51 and although the frequency of such co-infections is likely to be high, data are scarce. The complexity of the issue is compounded by the fact that majority of encephalitic viral infections is asymptomatic52. Our study reveals compelling findings that delivery of SFV prior to IAV (SFV→IAV) has a detrimental effect on immune responses to influenza viruses. It markedly skews dynamics of immune responses to IAV, resulting in altered T cell trafficking, higher viral load in the lungs, aggravated lung histopathology and affects magnitude, TCR clonal distribution and inflammatory milieu during respiratory virus infection. While this study focused on responses to IAV, it is reasonable to anticipate perturbed immune responses to SFV following IAV infection. These investigations are currently ongoing.Initial observations revealed a significantly lower viral load in lungs of SFV→IAV at the early stage of infection (3 dpi). One possible explanation for the early viral load suppression is the effect of type I IFN triggered by SFV infection. Type I IFN inhibits IAV replication53 and SFV is a known inducer of early interferon response54. However, by day 7 post-infection these mice showed exacerbated respiratory disease characterised by dysregulated inflammatory responses and greater tissue damage in the lungs. Paradoxically, these have been linked to excessive IFNα/β signalling during acute influenza virus infection and influenza-bacterial co-infections55,56. While we found no changes in B cell and myeloid cell compartments in either lungs or brain, there was an unexpected influx of activated CD8+ T cells to the brain of SFV→IAV mice. These cells were IAV-specific and appeared to traffic to the brain instead of lungs and spleen, both tissues showing significantly decreased immunodominant DbNP366+ and DbPA224+ T cell responses. A significantly larger proportion of bulk CD8+ T cells infiltrating the brain in SFV→IAV group was CD38+PD-1+, and these CD8+ T cells were IAV tetramer-specific. On the other hand, the majority of CD38+PD-1+CD8+ T cells infiltrating the brain of IAV-only infected group were IAV tetramer-negative, suggesting recruitment of bystander CD8+ T cells to the brain in the absence of SFV infection, presumably due to their inflammation-induced expansion in the periphery. We previously reported that co-expression of CD38 and PD-1 on CD8+ T cells characterises hyperactivation in severe influenza disease and is linked to higher viral load at the site of infection57. Although SFV→IAV infected animals demonstrated higher viral load, we did not observe any differences in the activation profile in the lungs. Interestingly, the majority of IAV tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells infiltrating the brain in IAV-only group were CD25+ and much higher proportion was DbNP366-specific rather than DbPA224-specific. This indicates recent CD8+ T cell activation in draining lymph nodes, with the levels of CD25 expression on tetramer+CD8+ T cells being consistent with previous reports58.Our adoptive transfer experiments using naïve and activated OT-I cells indicated that trafficking of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells to the brain is antigen-driven. Although we could not detect infectious influenza virus in the brain of either IAV or SFV→IAV infected animals, we detected IAV matrix RNA at high levels in SFV→IAV group. The viral entry into the brain and influx of IAV-specific CD8+ T cells appears to be facilitated by increased BBB permeability. Both IAV and SFV could affect BBB permeability, but this was further enhanced by sequential SFV→IAV infection, as measured by Evans Blue dye extravasation. While SFV is known to compromise BBB59, we used a non-neurotropic strain of influenza, which does not cause brain infection, although it has been shown to affect BBB permeability to some extent60. Therefore, the exacerbation of BBB leakiness has been compounded by IAV infection at the early phase post-co-infection.The effects of SFV→IAV co-infection not only affected cell trafficking but had a multipronged effect on short- and long-term immunity. Primary infection (either bacterial or viral) can lead to the development of paralysed DCs and macrophages with poor antigen-presenting capabilities and diminished ability to secrete immunogenic cytokines39, which in turn results in impaired T cell activation and trafficking. The immune paralysis of APCs is a result of an excessive production of local mediators directed at reduction of immunopathology caused by inflammatory responses. Our data show an excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs of SFV→IAV animals and significantly higher viral titres in the lungs. Consequently, we observed impaired proliferation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the MLN resulting in significantly reduced numbers of these cells in the lungs.Our TCRαβ analysis revealed closely related TCRαβ clonotypes, with prominent IAV-specific TCR gene segments and motifs cluster according to their Vα, Vβ, Jα, and Jβ signatures, indicating selective recruitment of IAV epitope-specific T cells. These findings agree with studies that reported a biased TRAV and TRBV gene usage and prevalent motifs in IAV infection in B6 mice18,21,23,28. Prior to our study, ex vivo epitope-specific TCR analysis in the brain during IAV infection was non-existent. Our data showed a statistically significant increase in clonotype diversity during SFV→IAV sequential infection, especially in the brain, with a much greater and more extensive pairing of TRAV and TRBV, indicating a more heterogenous CD8+ T cell response encompassing suboptimal TCRs27. Such increased diversity of TCRαβ clonotypes within IAV-specific CD8+ T cells raises the question about the nature of TCRαβ clonotypes recruited into the immune response exclusively during sequential infection with a neurotropic virus.A surprising finding of our study is the abolition of the immunodominance hierarchy in IAV→SFV group. While we observed significant changes in CD8+ T cell responses to IAV during the acute phase in SFV→IAV group, there was no difference in CD8+ T cell memory formation or recall capacity. However, when the order of viruses was reversed, we found a significantly reduced numbers of IAV tetramer+CD8+ T cells in the lungs, and the magnitude of the recall response was significantly diminished. Interestingly, the immunodominance hierarchy was eliminated in IAV→SFV group. Nucleoprotein NP366 and acid polymerase PA224 peptides presented by H2Db in C57BL/6 mice are characterised by well-defined immunodominance hierarchy. The primary CD8+ T cell responses to DbNP366 and DbPA224 are of comparable magnitude, however, DbNP366+CD8+ T cell responses are by far immunodominant and constitute majority (80–90%) of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells after the secondary IAV infection61. The main factor driving the immunodominance in the recall response is antigen presentation during the primary response62 and antigen persistence of the NP366 epitope63. CD8+ T cells of different specificities receive discrete signals during the late phase of acute infection (post day 8) impacting the immunodominance hierarchy, and T cells responding to poorly presented antigens, such as DbPA224, lack robust proliferative capacity upon recall63. Therefore, it appears that in IAV→SFV sequential infection, SFV interfered with IAV antigen presentation during the late phase of the primary IAV response by impeding the ability of DCs to present IAV antigens and overwhelming the system with SFV antigens. DbNP366 is efficiently presented during the late phase of the primary response by virtue of prolonged engagement with DCs63, this interaction could have been impacted by outcompeting abundant SFV antigens. As a result, DbNP366 and DbPA224 were effectively presented only during the early phase of the primary IAV-specific CD8+ T cell response, which resulted in the abolition of immunodominance hierarchy.Altogether, as demonstrated by our study, viral sequential infection can alter the magnitude, function and trafficking of CD8+ T cell responses to unrelated viruses, both in acute and memory phase. It is striking that a neurotropic virus affecting completely different tissue such as brain has a profound effect on respiratory immunity. An important consideration in SFV/IAV co-infection is the fact that majority of neurotropic infections are asymptomatic and not being considered a risk factor during an influenza virus infection. Yet, prior arbovirus infection can greatly affect the outcome of IAV-specific immune responses, resulting in a severe respiratory disease or compromised long-term immunity.MethodsAnimals and ethics statementC57BL/6 mice were bred at the Peter Doherty Institute Bioresources Facilities. Animal experiments followed the NHMRC Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes guidelines and were approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee (AEC 1714184 and 21319). All mice were monitored daily for clinical signs including determination of their body weight. All animals were kept in HEPA filtered, individually ventilated cages, with environmental enrichment, 12 h light dark cycle and food and water ad libitum. Tissues from infected animals were processed in class II BSC.Viruses, infection, OT-I system, and CpG administrationIn all, 6–8 weeks old male and female mice were initially infected with avirulent A7(74) strain of Semliki Forest virus64. All mice were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 5×103 pfu of A7(74) in 0.1 mL PBS containing 0.75% bovine serum albumin (PBSA). For subsequent influenza A virus (IAV) infections, mice were lightly anaesthetised with isoflurane and infected by intranasal (i.n.) instillation (30 μL) with 104 pfu of A/HK/x31 (X31; H3N2). For the secondary IAV infection experiments, mice were challenged with 103 pfu A/PR/8/34 i.n. (PR8, H1N1) at ~100 days following the primary IAV infection. To investigate immune mechanisms using the OT-I system, 1x106 of FACS-sorted CD8+CD44loCD62LhiCD45.1+ OT-I cells65 were transferred i.v. into the C57BL/6 mice. Mice were subsequently infected with 104 pfu x31-OVA recombinant virus34 1 day later. In selected experiments, mice were administered i.p. with 20 nmol CpG 1668 (Bioneer, Oakland, CA, USA) to induce aseptic inflammatory response.Tissue sampling and cell preparationBrain, lungs, spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) were collected from mice at various time points after infection. To remove blood from the tissue vasculature, following terminal anaesthesia, animals were perfused with 10 mL PBS through the left cardiac ventricle. The comparison of transcardiac perfusion with intravascular antibody labelling demonstrated that perfusion is sufficient to analyse cell populations in the brain, including naïve brain66. Brains were removed and processed for virus infectivity assay and chemokines/cytokines levels (half brain bisected sagittally along the midline), preparation of RNA for gene expression studies (half brain), analysis of cell infiltrates (entire brain), or histopathological assessment (entire brain). Single-cell suspensions were purified from the brain, spleen, lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN). The brain tissue was digested with 1785 units/mL collagenase type III (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) and 6 units/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). CNS-infiltrating leucocytes were isolated from the brain samples by centrifugation on a Percoll gradient (70%, 37% and 30% Percoll). Lungs were either homogenised and centrifuged to obtain clarified supernatants to assay for viral titres/cytokine composition or enzymatically digested in 1 mg/mL collagenase III (Worthington) and 0.5 mg/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) before passing through cell sieves to obtain single-cell suspensions for analysis. Where necessary, cell suspensions from tissues were incubated with 0.15 M NH4Cl and 17 mM Tris-HCI at pH 7.2 for 5 min at 37 °C to lyse red blood cells.Measurement of viral loadsPlaque assay on Vero cells (ATCC, #CCL-81) was used to titrate infectious SFV13. Vero cells were seeded in 12 well plates (2 x 105 cell per well) and incubated overnight at 37oC in a 5% CO2 incubator in DMEM media (Life Technologies) containing 10% FCS, 200 mM Glutamax (Life Technologies), and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Life Technologies). Following incubation cells were washed and infected with 200 μL of 10-fold dilutions (10−1 to 10−8) of the brain homogenate in DMEM at 37 °C for 1 h followed by 1 ml overlay medium (1% FCS and 1% HEPES and 0.5% Glutamax and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 1.6% w/v carboxy cellulose), and incubated for 72 hr at 37oC. Cells were fixed with 1 ml of 10% normal formalin for 1 hr and stained with 0.5% crystal violet (15 min) to visualise the plaques. All dilutions were assayed in duplicates. Titres of infectious IAV in the lungs were determined by plaque assays on confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell (ATCC, #CCL-34) monolayers in six-well plates57. Cells were infected with lung homogenates at 10-fold dilutions for 45 min at 37 °C before the addition of Leibovitz L15 or MEM medium containing 0.9% agarose overlay containing Trypsin (Worthington Biochemical). Plates were incubated at 37 °C 5%CO2 for 3 days and plaques counted on the cell layer and expressed as plaque forming units (PFU).Identification of SFV immunodominant peptideA7(74) SFV genome was analysed in all three reading frames using peptide prediction websites (http:/ools.iedb.org/mhci/, http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/HLArestrictor/)67 and peptide sequences were generated based on binding affinity prediction to mouse MHC-I (H2-Kb and H2-Db). Peptides (GenScript USA Inc) were resuspended up to 1 mM with DMSO, aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. Enriched T cell populations from brain and spleen were stimulated with 1 μM of the selected peptide for 5 hrs at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in the presence of 1000 U/mL recombinant IL-2 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and 1 μL/mL Golgi-Plug (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) as described44. Cells were washed and stained with CD8-PerCP Cy5.5 (clone 53-67, BD Biosciences 551162) for 30 mins on ice, fixed, permeabilised and stained for cytokines (IFN-γ-FITC, TNF-α-APC and IL-2-PE (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA)). Samples were acquired using BD Canto II, and the total cytokine production was calculated by subtracting background fluorescence using no peptide controls. PMA/ionomycin stimulated cells were used as positive controls. The known sequence of the peptides giving positive results were blasted against the NCBI database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to determine the position of the peptide in SFV proteome.Tetramer and immunophenotypic stainingMHC-I tetramers targeting the immunodominant epitope of the influenza nucleoprotein (DbNP366–374: ASNENMETM; DbPA224–233: SSLENFRAYV) and SFV envelope protein (Kb-E1159-166: TQFIFGPL) were produced in-house and conjugated to streptavidin-PE (BD Biosciences 554061), BV421 (BD Biosciences 563259) and APC (BD Biosciences 554067) respectively at 1:200 dilution at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. Lymphocytes were stained with combinations of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies: BD Biosciences: anti-CD8α-PerCyP Cy5.5 (53-67; 551162; 1:200), anti-CD44-Alexa Flour 700 (1M7; 560567; 1:200), anti-CD4-APC Cy7 (GK1.5; 552051; 1:500), anti-TCRβ-BV711 (H57-597; 563135; 1:200), anti-CD25-PECF594 (PC61; 562694; 1:200), anti-CD45.1-FITC (A20; 561871; 1:800), anti-CD62L-FITC (MEL-14; 561917; 1:200), anti-CD45.1-PE (A20; 553776; 1:200), anti-V2αTCR-FITC (B20.1; 553288; 1:100), anti-CD45R-APCCy7 (RA3-6B2, 552094; 1:200), anti-CD38-BV711 (90; 740697; 1:200), anti-CD138-PE (281-2; 553714; 1:400), anti-CD11c-FITC (HL3; 557400; 1:1000), anti-Gr1-FITC (RB6-8C5; 553126; 1:400), anti-CD64-AF647 (X54-5/7.1; 558539; 1:150), anti-Ly6C-AlexaFlour700 (AL-21; 561237; 1:400), anti-CD11b-BV605 (M1/70; 563015; 1:600), anti-CD45.2-BV711 (104; 563685; 1:400), anti-CD11c-PE (HL3; 553802; 1:400), anti-SigLecF-PECF594 (E50-2440; 562757; 1:1200), anti-Ly6G-PECy7 (1A8; 560601; 1:1200).BioLegend: anti-CD62L-BV570 (MEL-14; 104433; 1:200), anti-CD279-BV785 (29 F.1A12; 135225; 1:200), anti-CD38-PECy7 (90; 102718; 1:500), anti-CD8α-BV510 (53-6.7; 100752; 1:200), anti-CD103-BV421 (2E7; 121422; 1:200), anti-CD69-PECy7 (H1.2F3; 104512; 1:200), anti-CD62L-PECy7 (MEL-14; 104418; 1:200), anti-GL7-PerCyPCy5.5 (GL7; 144610; 1:200), anti-CD19-APC (6D5; 11512; 1:400), anti-I-Ab-PacBlue (AF6-120.1, 116422; 1:400), anti-IgD-PECy7 (11-26 c.2a; 405720; 1:200), anti-CD3-FITC (145-2C11; 100306; 1:400), anti-F4/80-FITC (RB6-8C5; 553126; 1:150).Invitrogen eBiosciences (anti-KLRG1-FITC (2F1; 11-5893-82; 1:200). Cell viability was determined by staining with either Live/Dead-Aqua 525 (L34966A, ThermoFisher, 1:800) or Live/Dead Fixable Near-IR (L10119, ThermoFisher, 1:800). Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde before analysis by flow cytometry. Antibody staining was performed at 4 °C in the dark. Samples were subsequently acquired on a BD LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer and data analysed by FlowJo Software (Tree Star Inc., USA). Gating strategies for flow cytometry data are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5.Cytokine and chemokine analysisCytokine and chemokine levels in tissue homogenates were analysed using the LEGENDPlex Multi-Analyte Flow Assay Kit (Biolegend) Mouse Anti-Virus Response Panel (13-plex) according to manufacturers’ instructions.Isolation and adoptive transfer of OT-I cellsNaïve CD45.1+ OT-I cells isolated from OT-I/Ly5.1 TCR transgenic mice were purified from single-cell suspensions prepared from lymph nodes (LNs). OT-I cells were FACS-sorted based on the expression of surface markers (CD8+CD44lowCD62LhiCD45.1+TCRVα2+) using a BD Aria III (BD Biosciences). Mice received 1x106 CD45.1+ OT-I cells intravenously in a volume of 200μl. Purified CD45.1+ OT-I cells were activated in vitro with Kb-restricted OVA257-264 Class I (SIINFEKL) peptide-pulsed splenocytes as described68. Mice were injected intravenously with 1x106 cells/mouse.In vivo T cell proliferation assayVPD450 (Violet Proliferation Dye)-labelled OT-1 cells (1x106) were transferred intravenously into C57BL/6 mice on day 7 post-SFV infection, or day −1 for X31-OVA infection. One day later, mice were inoculated with recombinant X31 influenza virus containing the KbOVA257–264 epitope (amino acid sequence SIINFEKL) within the stalk of the NA protein (X31-OVA)34,35. Mediastinal lymph nodes, lungs, and spleen were obtained on day 3.5 and 4.5. VPD450 levels of CD8+CD45.1+ cells were assessed by flow cytometry.RT-PCRHalf brain specimens were submerged in RNA stabilisation reagent, RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions and stored at −80°C until use. RNA quantity was determined by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 5 µg of RNA was converted to cDNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). RT-PCR was carried out using Fast SYBR Green Mastermix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and primers recognising the NSP3 region of SFV or Matrix (M) region IAV genomic RNA: viral NSP3 reverse primer- 5’-GGGAAAAGATGAGCAAACCA-3’; viral NSP3 forward primer- 5’-GCAAGAGGCAAACGAACAGA-3’; viral PR8 M reverse primer- 5’-GGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTACG-3’; viral PR8 M forward primer – 5’-GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC-3’. Levels of virus RNA were normalised to the housekeeping gene, GAPDH: mouse GAPDH reverse primer- 5’ TTGTCAAGCTCATTTCCTGGT-3’; mouse GAPDH forward primer – 5’ TTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTA-3’. Samples were run on a QuanStudio 7 Real time PCR machine (ThermoFisher) with the following PCR conditions: the first cycle was 5 min at 95 °C, 10 sec at 95 °C, 15 sec at 60 °C and 1 sec at 72 °C. The following 45 cycles: 10 sec at 95 °C, 15 sec at 60 °C, 1 sec at 72 °C and ended with 10 min at 40 °C. The relative amount of virus genomic RNA was calculated using the 2−∆∆CT method.Single-cell sorting and TCRαβ analysisFollowing staining, single DbNP366+CD8+ and DbPA224+CD8+ T cell populations were indexed single-cell sorted on a BD FACSAria III for TCR analysis performed as described21,24. Multiplex-nested RT-PCR-amplified CDR3α and CDR3β regions from single cells69,70 were analyzed by IMGT/V-QUEST before pairing through the TCRdist pipeline for modelling amino acid motifs, TCR landscapes, neighbour distance distribution and probabilities of generation (Pgen)71. Testing for variations in Pgen across epitope specificities was performed essentially as described24 using linear mixed models71. Data visualisation for CIRCOS plots was performed in R using a package for circular layout72.Determining blood-brain barrier permeabilityBlood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability was examined by an Evans Blue extravasation method29,30. Evans blue dye (EBD) (Sigma Aldrich) was prepared as a 2% solution in PBS and injected as a single bolus dose of 4 ml/kg intraperitoneally. To enable EBD’s uniform blood distribution mice were culled 3 hours after injection. Animals were perfused with PBS through the left cardiac ventricle to remove blood from the brain vasculature, brains were removed and placed in 1:3 weight (mg):volume (ml) ratios of 50% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), then homogenised. TCA extracts from the brain samples were centrifuged at 10,000×g for 20 min at 4°C to remove precipitates and tissue debris, and the supernatants were added to a 96-well plate at 30 μl per well, each plate supplemented with 90 μl of 95% ethanol and thoroughly mixed by pipetting. Fluorescence intensity was measured at 610 nm excitation/680 nm emission using the CLARIOstar Plus machine (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Hessen, Germany). The amount of EBD recovered from brains was expressed as micrograms of dye per gram of tissue using 8-point standard curve after correcting for the background of supernatants obtained from brains of uninfected mice.LEGENDscreen and InfinityFlow analysisSingle-cell suspension of brains, lungs, and spleens of single and co-infected mice (n = 16) were enriched for CD8+ T cells using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) CD8 enrichment kit (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Six samples were then biotin labelled with anti-mouse CD45.1 (A20, BioLegend 110704), followed by combinational barcoding with streptavidin BUV396 (BD Biosciences 564176), BUV496(BD Biosciences 612961), and BV421 (BD Biosciences 563259). Brain CD8+ T cells of IAV-infected mice were BUV395 labelled, brain CD8+ T cells of SFV → IAV infected mice were BUV 496 labelled, lung CD8+ T cells of IAV-infected mice were BV421 labelled, lung CD8+ T cells of SFV → IAV infected mice were BUV 395 + BUV 496 labelled, spleen CD8+ T cells of IAV-infected mice were BUV395 + BUV421 labelled, and spleen CD8+ T cells of SFV → IAV infected mice were BUV496 + BV421 labelled. After barcoding, samples were stained with anti-CD8a, KLRG1, CD44, CD38, PD-1 and CD62L antibodies as a backbone panel, washed, pooled, and aliquoted to 75,000 cells per well in assay plates. Preparation of assay plates, staining, and fixation was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (LEGENDScreen Mouse PE Kit, BioLegend). Following data collection, FCS files were examined in FlowJo (Tree Star Inc., USA) for quality control, and CD8+ T cells were exported into new FCS files for each well to be used as input for InfinityFlow prediction pipeline using the infinityFlow R package as described in ref. 38. Specifically, 10,000 events randomly selected from each file to train XGBoost non-linear regression model implemented in the xgboost R package with a depth of 500 trees, a learning rate of 0.05 and otherwise default parameters. This model aimed at predicting the intensity of the PE-conjugated variable antibody expression from the backbone expression data for each cell in the well. From non-training data, up to 10,000 events were randomly selected for each well and concatenated across wells to generate the backbone matrix of the InfinityFlow output. Predictions from all models were generated across all of these non-training events to generate the final InfinityFlow matrix, containing backbone-measured and variable-predicted expression intensities. These predictions were finally concatenated and dimensionally reduced with UMAP on backbone parameters to generate a single data matrix. For downstream analysis, OT-I T cells originating from distinct organs and infection contexts were then debarcoded and analyzed with the OMIQ cloud platform (omiq.ai). InfinityFlow augmented data matrix was scaled using hyperbolic arcsine (asinh) transformation and UMAP dimensionality reduction using InfinityFlow prediction was performed with the following parameters: n_neighbors = 15, min_dist = 0.1, metric = euclidean and n_epocs = 200. Clustering was performed using FlowSOM with InfinityFlow predicted markers in OMIQ.HistopathologyLungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, processed for embedding in paraffin wax, cut into thin sections, stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and analysed microscopically. Multiple sections were cut through the lungs at 5 μm thickness at 100 μm intervals (x5 levels).Histopathology was performed by the Phenomics Australia Histopathology and Digital Slide Service at the University of Melbourne.Statistical analysesStatistical analyses were performed using Student’s unpaired t test within GraphPad Prism 9 software.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Close Key Takeaways Recent research shows that some people may experience long flu after having influenza. You may be able to treat long flu on your own at home.It’s important to see a doctor if your symptoms persist or interfere with your daily activities. The COVID-19 pandemic put a fresh eye on infectious diseases, including the consequences that can come from having a virus. While long COVID is now a well-known condition, researchers have discovered that people can develop lingering illness from the flu, too. A recent study of more than 92,000 people compared the health outcomes of those who were admitted to the hospital with COVID versus people admitted with the flu. The researchers found that both viruses caused people to have lingering health problems that can last for months to years. “We’re learning that these respiratory viruses can have long-term effects,” William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told Verywell. “It seems like that was always the case. We’re just becoming much more aware of it now.” Long Colds vs. Long COVID: Here's What Researchers Know So Far What Causes Long Flu? Research into long flu is in its infancy. “We’re learning now that a variety of infections result in symptoms after the acute phase as consequences of infection,” Thomas Russo, MD, professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York, told Verywell. Long flu can cause respiratory symptoms like shortness of breath and a cough with activity, he said. It’s unclear why someone might develop long flu. “It’s probably due to a continuing inflammatory response,” Schaffner said. “This is your body’s way of fighting off the infection. You’ve gotten over the acute infection, but it’s as though the army that is your immune system keeps fighting.” New Criteria Helps Predict Which COVID-19 Patients Experience Cytokine Storm How to Treat Long Flu There are a few options to treat long flu at home. Schaffner recommends taking warm showers once or twice a day to get moisture into your lungs and running a humidifier at night. “Clean the humidifier after every use, dry it off, and, when you use it again, put in a new supply of water,” he said. “If you don’t, bacteria can grow, and you can inhale the bacteria, making you sicker.” If you’re experiencing pain or body aches, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or naproxen can help, Schaffner said. Taking any medication long-term without consulting a doctor first isn’t advised, Russo said. If you’re considering taking a medication like acetaminophen or NSAIDs long-term or find that you’ve been taking them consistently for more than a few weeks, Russo said it’s time to consult a doctor. For coughs, Schaffner said that consuming a spoonful of honey or mixing it with warm water or tea may temporarily help. “It’s not very useful to take an over-the-counter cough suppressant—they don’t work very well,” he said. Study Shows ‘Long Flu’ Is Real, but Long COVID Is Worse When to See a Healthcare Provider for Long Flu A lingering cough is usually a good indicator to make a doctor’s appointment, Schaffner said. If you suspect that you have long flu, Russo said it’s best to see a healthcare provider for an evaluation to make sure you’re not dealing with another health issue. Long flu is a diagnosis of exclusion—meaning doctors want to rule out other health issues first—and it’s important to be checked for other illnesses as well. “If you have symptoms that last more than a few weeks after flu recovery that affect your daily activities, you should reach out to a healthcare provider to see if there is any sort of systemic treatment that could be beneficial,” Russo said. You should contact your doctor if you find that you feel better after having the flu and then get worse within a week or two. “You could have a secondary infection like bronchitis or pneumonia,” Russo said. More research is needed on how to effectively treat long flu. But Russo said that bronchodilators like albuterol and salmeterol, as well as pulmonary rehabilitation, might work for long flu. These interventions are also recommended for respiratory symptoms of long COVID. You’re more likely to develop long flu if you have a serious course of influenza, which doctors said makes the case for getting an annual flu vaccine. “We certainly know that vaccination seems to be the most important measure to minimize acute consequences with long COVID,” Russo said. “We don’t have as much data for long flu, but there’s no question it would help, too.” What This Means For You Like long COVID, long flu is a real illness. If you have symptoms of long flu, including shortness of breath and a lingering cough, and they last for more than two weeks after you recover from the flu, it’s time to consult a doctor. 1 Source Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Bukaty, file) Read More By PATRICK WHITTLE Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Avian influenza is killing tens of thousands of seals and sea lions in different corners of the world, disrupting ecosystems and flummoxing scientists who don’t see a clear way to slow the devastating virus.The worldwide bird flu outbreak that began in 2020 has led to the deaths of millions of domesticated birds and spread to wildlife all over the globe. This virus isn’t thought to be a major threat to humans, but its spread in farming operations and wild ecosystems has caused widespread economic turmoil and environmental disruptions.Seals and sea lions, in places as far apart as Maine and Chile, appear to be especially vulnerable to the disease, scientists said. The virus has been detected in seals on the east and west coasts of the U.S., leading to deaths of more than 300 seals in New England and a handful more in Puget Sound in Washington. The situation is even more dire in South America, where more than 20,000 sea lions have died in Chile and Peru and thousands of elephant seals have died in Argentina. The virus can be controlled in domesticated animals, but it can spread unchecked in wildlife and marine mammals such as South America’s seals that lacked prior exposure to it have suffered devastating consequences, said Marcela Uhart, director of the Latin America program at the Karen C. Drayer Wildlife Health Center at the University of California, Davis. RELATED COVERAGE South Carolina lab recaptures 5 more escaped monkeys but 13 are still loose First emperor penguin known to reach Australia found on tourist beach ‘I got my life back.’ Veterans with PTSD making progress thanks to service dog program “Once the virus is in wildlife, it spreads like wildfire, as long as there are susceptible animals and species,” Uhart said. “Movement of animals spreads the virus to new areas.” Scientists are still researching how the seals have contracted bird flu, but it is most likely from contact with infected seabirds, Uhart said. High mortality has affected South American marine mammals consistently since the virus arrived late in 2022, and birds in Peru and Chile have died by the hundreds of thousands from the virus since then, she noted. The virus is still spreading and was detected in mainland Antarctica for the first time in February.The deaths of seals and sea lions disrupts ecosystems where the marine mammals serve as key predators near the top of the food chain. Seals help keep the ocean in balance by preventing overpopulation of the fish species they feed on.Many species affected, such as South American sea lions and Southern elephant seals, have relatively stable populations, but scientists worry about the possibility of the virus jumping to more jeopardized animals. Scientists have said bird flu might have played a role in the deaths of hundreds of endangered Caspian seals in Russia last year.“The loss of wildlife at the current scale presents an unprecedented risk of wildlife population collapse, creating an ecological crisis,” the World Organisation for Animal Health, an intergovernmental organization, said in a statement.In New England, scientists with the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University found an outbreak of bird flu that killed more than 330 harbor and gray seals along the North Atlantic coast in 2022 turned out to be worse than initially thought. It’s possible the seals contracted the virus from gulls by coming into contact with sick gulls’ excrement or by preying on an infected bird, the scientists reported. The U.S. government determined the seal die-off was an “unusual mortality event” attributable to bird flu. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has declared the event is over, but concerns remain about a possible repeat. “Marine mammals are still pretty unique in the scale of the outbreaks that are occurring,” said Wendy Puryear, an author of the Tufts study. “One of the connections is there is a lot of virus that circulates in coastal birds. A lot of opportunities for those wild birds to host the virus and pass it on to marine mammals.”Some scientists and environmental advocates say there could be a link between the outbreaks and climate change and warming oceans. Warmer sea temperatures off northern Chile decrease the population of forage fish, and that makes sea lions weaker and more susceptible to disease, said Liesbeth van der Meer, director of the environmental group Oceana in Chile. Scientists and environmentalists are hopeful vaccinating poultry will help lessen the spread of the disease, van der Meer said, adding that it’s also important for people to avoid potentially infected animals in the wild. “Authorities have carried out campaigns about the disease, strongly recommending to stay away from seabirds or marine mammals with symptoms or found dead in the coastal areas,” van der Meer said.Even seals in aquariums are not considered completely safe from bird flu. The New England Aquarium, where outdoor harbor seal exhibits delight thousands of visitors every year, has taken strict sanitation precautions to prevent transmission of the virus to its animals, said Melissa Joblon, the Boston aquarium’s director of animal health. Staff aren’t allowed to bring backyard poultry products to the aquarium, and an awning protects the seal exhibit from birds that could carry the virus, she said.“We do know that it’s a risk for the animals that reside here,” said Joblon, adding that none of the aquarium’s seals have been infected.The deaths of marine mammals are even more concerning because of mutations of the avian virus, according to a paper in the journal Nature Communications last fall. The mutations “warrant further examination and highlight an urgent need for active local surveillance to manage outbreaks and limit spillover into other species, including humans,” the study stated.Another study, published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases in February, found the bird flu virus has adapted to spread between birds and mammals. Researchers found nearly identical samples of the virus in dead sea lions, a dead seal and a dead seabird. They said the finding is significant because it confirms a multispecies outbreak that can affect marine mammals and birds.More seal deaths could disrupt critical ecosystems around the world, said Lynda Doughty, executive director of Marine Mammals of Maine, a marine mammal rescue organization that responded to seals with bird flu during the New England outbreak. “You need this happy ecosystem. If we’re taking out some important species, what is the trickle down effect of that?

(Photo by Matt Stone/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald via Getty Images) (Getty Images) STEVENS COUNTY, Minn. (FOX 9) - A goat kid in Stevens County, Minnesota, has tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), marking the first case in the United States of bird flu in a domestic ruminant. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health announced Wednesday the juvenile goat residing on a farm with HPAI-positive poultry also tested positive for the same virus. This is the first U.S. detection in cattle, sheep, goat or their relatives. "This finding is significant because, while the spring migration is definitely a higher risk transmission period for poultry, it highlights the possibility of the virus infecting other animals on farms with multiple species," State Veterinarian Dr. Brian Hoefs said. "Thankfully, research to-date has shown mammals appear to be dead-end hosts, which means they’re unlikely to spread HPAI further." The Board of Animal Health says all the poultry on the farm were already quarantined after HPAI was detected in February. Following the confirmation of HPAI in the goat, the Board of Animal Health quarantined all other animals at the farm. The Board of Animal Health is working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to investigate the virus' transmission. Unusual goat deaths The owner of the goat notified the Board of Animal Health of newly kidded goats on the farm, where a backyard poultry flock had been depopulated due to bird flu. The goats and poultry had access to the same space and shared a water source. The body of one goat was taken to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, where it tested positive for influenza A, and the National Veterinary Services Laboratories later confirmed it was H5N1 HPAI, which is the same virus circulating in the national outbreak that began in 2022, a press release says. Samples from adult goats were negative for HPAI and they all appear healthy, the Board of Animal Health says. No other sick goat kids have been reported since March 11. HPAI in other mammals The bird flu has previously been found in other mammal species, including skunks, dogs and cats, but this is the first time it's been found in a domestic ruminant, the release says. Animals with weakened or immature immune systems, like goat kids, are at a higher risk of contracting the disease. "There has been limited experimental data on HPAI infection in ruminants, and there are no prior reports of natural HPAI infection in goats. The USDA has tracked more than 200 detections of HPAI in mammals across the country since the start of the 2022 HPAI outbreak," the press release states. Bird flu and humans Health officials note the risk to the public is "extremely low" and any risk of infection is limited to those who have direct contact with infected animals. No humans in the U.S. have gotten sick after having contact with mammals infected with bird flu, the Board of Animal Health says. The Minnesota Department of Health has recommendations for personal protective equipment and is monitoring the health of those who have had direct contact with the infected goats. Anyone who develops respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms after exposure to the goats may be voluntarily tested for avian influenza and other respiratory pathogens, the release said.

provided by SK bioscience 21 Mar, 2024, 13:24 CST Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX Company exported 440,000 doses to Thailand, marking its entry into the Southeast Asian market and the Southern Hemisphere market. Company has obtained marketing authorizations in 12 countries, with additional approvals underway in 10 countries to expand its market worldwide. BANGKOK and SEONGNAM, South Korea , March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SK bioscience, a global innovative vaccine and biotech company committed to promoting human health from prevention to cure, announced today that the company has shipped approximately 440,000 doses of SKYCellflu® to Biogenetech in Thailand from its vaccine manufacturing facility 'L HOUSE' in Andong, South Korea. Continue Reading SK bioscience exports influenza vaccine, SKYCellflu® to Thailand, entering southern hemisphere market. The vaccine, the company's self-developed cell-cultured influenza vaccine, contains the recommended composition of influenza virus for use in the 2024 Southern Hemisphere influenza season announced by the World Health Organization (WHO). Starting with the export to Thailand, SK bioscience expects to extend its sales not only in the Southeast Asian market but also in the Southern Hemisphere market. Thailand is affected by both the WHO's Northern and Southern Hemisphere flu vaccination guidelines due to its elongated geography from north to south. Recently, Thailand Department of Disease Control has launched a vaccination campaign aimed at workers in 31 major tourist areas in efforts to prevent influenza after the COVID-19 pandemic. SKYCellflu® is the world's first cell culture-based influenza vaccine to obtain WHO Pre-qualification (PQ) certification. Last year, the company resumed production of SKYCellflu® and secured first place in the national immunization program bid for the 2023-24 season after a three-year hiatus due to the production of the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic.Compared to the egg-based vaccine, SKYCellflu® is safe for people who are allergic to eggs and does not require antibiotic or preservative administration. Furthermore, it is more suitable for rapid production in response to pandemics.SK bioscience intends to expand its global market through procurement contacts with international organizations such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). SKYCellflu® has already received marketing authorizations in 12 countries globally, including Malaysia, Singapore, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Chile. It is currently or will soon be approved in ten more countries, clearing the path for a full-fledged expansion of the export market.According to Grand View Research, the global influenza vaccine market is projected to expand to approximately $12.58 billion by 2030, with an average annual growth rate of 6.98 percent.Jaeyong Ahn, CEO of SK bioscience, said, "The export of SKYCellflu® to Thailand serves as a stepping-stone for entering the Southeast Asian and Southern Hemisphere markets and expanding into the global market." He added, " In addition to diversifying our existing product markets, we are committed to developing vaccines with blockbuster potential, such as our next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate, which is expected to enter phase III clinical trials this year."Meanwhile, SK bioscience continues to push ahead to explore new sales channels by obtaining regulatory approvals for its self-developed vaccines globally. SKYTyphoid®, its typhoid conjugate vaccine, has received WHO PQ certification, while SKYVaricella®, its varicella vaccine, has obtained marketing authorization in Mexico.Furthermore, the company is accelerating its 'Globalization' project, which transfers its R&D and production capability to other countries to establish region-specific manufacturing hubs for stable global supply. Last July, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO), a state-owned pharmaceutical company, to transfer manufacturing technology for influenza vaccine.- SK bioscience Website- SK bioscience LinkedinContactSK bioscience Communications TeamChanghyun Jin([email protected])Jeannie S.

Flu vaccination has been associated with lower rates of some cardiac events among people with heart disease, especially among those who have had a cardiac event in the past year. If you have heart disease or have had a stroke and you get flu symptoms, call your health care provider right away. CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people with heart disease or who have had a stroke who have confirmed or suspected flu infection. People at increased risk Spotlight‎ People with heart disease and those who have had a stroke are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. If you have heart disease, or have had a stroke, it is especially important that you get a flu vaccine every flu season to protect against flu and its potentially serious complications. Among adults hospitalized with flu during recent flu seasons, heart disease was one of the most common chronic (long-term) conditions—about half of adults hospitalized with flu have heart disease. Studies have shown that flu illness is associated with an increase in heart attacks and stroke. A 2018 study found that the risk of having a heart attack was 6 times higher within a week of a confirmed flu infection. These findings were most pronounced for older adults and those experiencing their first heart attack. Additionally, a 2020 study that looked at more than 80,000 U.S. adults hospitalized with flu over eight flu seasons (2010-11 through 2017-18) found that sudden, serious heart complications occurred in one out of every eight patients (~12% of patients). What is heart disease?‎ Heart disease includes, but is not limited to, the following common conditions:-Heart failure-Hypertensive heart disease-Pulmonary heart disease-Heart valve disorders-Arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation-Congenital heart defectsLearn more Vaccination is the best protection against flu Flu vaccination has been associated with lower rates of some cardiac events among people with heart disease, especially among those who have had a cardiac event in the past year Types of flu vaccines for people with heart disease Flu vaccines are approved for use in people with heart disease and certain other health conditions. Flu vaccines have a long, established safety record in people with heart disease and those who have had a stroke and studies support the safety in people with these conditions. People with heart disease or history of a stroke should generally not get the nasal spray vaccine (i.e., the live attenuated influenza vaccine or LAIV). There are several flu vaccine options available this season. Your doctor or other health care professional can answer any questions you might have about flu vaccine. Keep Reading: Different Types of Flu VaccinesPneumococcal vaccination is also important Having flu increases your risk of getting pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death. People who have heart disease should also be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination. This vaccination protects against pneumococcal pneumonia and other serious infections. You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine. Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you. Other preventive actions for people with heart disease or history of stroke In addition to getting a flu vaccine, people with heart disease or who have had a stroke should take the same everyday preventive actions CDC recommends for everyone, including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs and sneezes, and washing hands often. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces. Keep Reading: Preventing Respiratory VirusesSpecific health actions for people with heart disease or history of stroke Plan ahead to maintain sufficient supplies of your regular medications for your chronic medical condition(s) (e.g., at least a two-week supply). Do not stop taking your regular medications without first consulting your health care provider, especially in the event that you become sick with flu or another respiratory infection. People with heart failure should be alert to changes in their breathing and should promptly report changes to their health care provider. If you have heart disease or have had a stroke and you get flu symptoms, call your health care provider right away. CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people with heart disease or who have had a stroke who have confirmed or suspected flu infection.

Thus, we developed a chimpanzee adenovirus-based combination vaccine, AdC68-HATRBD, with dual specificity against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus. When used as a standalone vaccine, intranasal immunization with AdC68-HATRBD induced comprehensive and potent immune responses consisting of immunoglobin (Ig) G, mucosal IgA, neutralizing antibodies, and memory T cells, which protected the mice from BA.5.2 and pandemic H1N1 infections. When used as a heterologous booster, AdC68-HATRBD markedly improved the protective immune response of the licensed SARS-CoV-2 or influenza vaccine. Therefore, whether administered intranasally as a standalone or booster vaccine, this combination vaccine is a valuable strategy to enhance the overall vaccine efficacy by inducing robust systemic and mucosal immune responses, thereby conferring dual lines of immunological defenses for these two viruses.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza viruses are the two leading causes of respiratory viral infections with high morbidity and mortality. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus isolated in late 2019. As of October 18, 2023, 771,407,825 cases of COVID-19 and 6,972,152 deaths had been confirmed worldwide by the World Health Organization (WHO) Coronavirus Dashboard, although these figures are dramatically underestimated. Acute respiratory illnesses caused by influenza viruses have occurred for centuries in the form of pandemics, epidemics, outbreaks, and sporadic cases1. Annual influenza epidemics result in ~ billion infections, 3 – 5 million cases of severe illness, and 29,000 – 650,000 deaths2.Vaccination is the primary strategy for combating infectious diseases. COVID-19 vaccines were available in 2021, and ~68.9% of the global population has received at least one dose of the vaccine as of September 2023, resulting in decreased rates of severe illness and mortality3. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has not been terminated by widespread vaccination; new variants, such as the currently circulating Omicron variant, continue to emerge. Waves of worldwide morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality have accompanied the emergence of new variants of concern (VOC) that have enhanced rates of transmission and/or ability to evade pre-existing SARS-COV-2 immunity4. Vaccination schedules have failed to keep pace with the pandemic, and booster doses are being used to improve protection against symptomatic and severe disease. Both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus thwart vaccination efforts due to waning vaccine- or infection-acquired immunity and their rapid and frequent mutation that evade pre-existing immunity. Presently, the influenza virus is the only pathogen for which annual vaccination is recommended. For the COVID-19 vaccine, the latest WHO recommendations is that high priority-use groups and sub-populations with special considerations should be revaccinated at 6–12 months after their previous dose5. Wiemken, T. L. et al. found that COVID-19 cases follow a similar seasonal pattern to other respiratory viruses, with transmission peaking during the winter despite continuing throughout the year, and supported employing annual preventative measures against SARS-CoV-2, such as seasonal booster vaccinations in a timeframe similar to that of influenza6. If it subsequently proves to be true, vaccination campaigns against both infections can be combined to reduce the total intervention cost; thus, a combination vaccine can be crucial. Moreover, the willingness to receive COVID-19 booster doses is significantly lower than that for primary vaccinations7,8,9,10. Combining influenza vaccines with COVID-19 booster doses might increase uptake of the latter since many populations are accustomed to receiving annual influenza vaccines11,12. Since the single, combination vaccine would offer protection against COVID-19 and influenza, it is clearly a better option for economically and effectively managing the pandemic.SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses primarily infect the respiratory tract and spread through respiratory droplets and aerosols; therefore, the viral load within the oropharynx is an important determinant of disease transmission13,14,15. Currently, most of the approved COVID-19 and influenza vaccines are administered intramuscularly. These intramuscular (i.m.) vaccines elicit a potent systemic immune response but poor mucosal immunity localized in the respiratory tract, which may explain their suboptimal effectiveness in preventing infection16,17. Mucosal vaccination that induces robust local mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract may be critical in preventing viral infection, replication, and shedding and therefore, transmission18. Mucosal vaccines for COVID-19 and influenza are a logical approach to reduce viral infection and transmission.Therefore, based on chimpanzee adenovirus serotype-68 (AdC68)19, we developed an intranasal (i.n.) combination vaccine, AdC68-HATRBD, with dual specificity against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus, and evaluated the immunogenicity and protective potency of one or two doses in mice. We also investigated the potential of the combination vaccine as a heterologous booster following the licensed COVID-19 and influenza vaccine administration. Overall, we aimed to develop a convenient, affordable, and effective combination vaccine against COVID-19 and influenza.ResultsDesign and construction of the combination vaccine AdC68-HATRBDSARS-CoV-2 infects cells via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, which binds to the cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Human influenza A viruses initiate infection by binding hemagglutinin (HA) to salivary acid receptors on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells. Previous studies demonstrated the role of RBD- and HA-based vaccines in inducing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that protect against viral infections20,21. Based on the chimpanzee adenoviral vector AdC68, we designed a combination vaccine, AdC68-HATRBD, carrying dual antigens of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. This vaccine contains two chimeric RBD dimers, numerous T cell epitopes (TCEs) of SARS-CoV-2, and full-length HA of A/California/07/2009 (pH1N1) (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1: Design and construction of the combination vaccine AdC68-HATRBD.a Diagram of AdC68-HATRBD construction. odRBD, Omicron-Delta chimeric RBD dimer; baRBD, Beta-Alpha chimeric RBD dimer; TCEs, tandem conserved T-cell epitopes from ORF1,ORF3, and M proteins of SARS-CoV-2. b The sequence of baRBD or odRBD was subjected to AlphaFold2 server for tertiary structure prediction, and analyzed using PyMol. In baRBD dimer, Beta RBD subunit is shown in orange with Alpha RBD in green. In odRBD dimer, Omicron RBD subunit is shown in grey with Delta RBD in pink. c Western blot analysis of expression of RBD dimers and HA in AdC68-HATRBD transduced HEK 293 cell lysates under reductive conditions. AdC68-empty was included as negative control.Full size imageA COVID-19 protein subunit vaccine ZF2001, based on the tandem homo-prototype RBD-dimer of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, confers 87.6% protection against severe to critical COVID-1922. The RBD dimers are much more immunogenic than RBD monomers, since RBD protomers are in a dimer stack on top of each other via the core subdomains, exposing the RBM, the primary site recognized by neutralizing antibody23. Given that SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly evolving, the induction of immunity against current VOCs alone is insufficient to protect against future VOCs. We hope to cover as many VOCs as possible with the two chimeric RBD-dimers strategy, thereby inducing broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies to afford protection against current and future VOCs. Specifically, the C-terminal Beta RBD was linked to the N-terminal Alpha RBD, forming a Beta-Alpha chimeric dimer (baRBD), and the C-terminal Omicron BA.1 RBD was linked to the N-terminal Delta RBD, forming an Omicron-Delta chimeric dimer (odRBD). Figure 1b displays the predicted tertiary structures of chimeric RBD dimers. To broaden cellular immunity, immunogenic TCEs were selected from the structural and nonstructural proteins of ancestral SARS-CoV-2, which are conserved across VOCs and involved in T-cell activation against COVID-1924,25,26. Western blot analyses revealed dose-dependent effect of the vaccine on gene expression of chimeric RBD dimers and HA in vitro (Fig. 1c).The prime-boost regimen induces superior humoral immune responsesIntranasal vaccine delivery is an effective, non-invasive route of immunization. To investigate the distribution of vaccines administered intranasally, mice were immunized intranasally with 5 × 107 infectious units (IFU) of AdC68-HATRBD, and lungs and nasal turbinates were collected to quantify vector genome load (Supplementary Fig. 1a). PBS-treated mice served as controls. Compared to controls, viral loads in the lungs of AdC68-HATRBD-treated mice were at baseline levels, whereas those in the nasal turbinates were as high as 2.4 × 108 copy numbers/g (Supplementary Fig. 1b), indicating that the vaccine is dominantly distributed in the upper respiratory tract rather than in the lungs.We first evaluated the humoral immunogenicity of AdC68-HATRBD as an i.n. vaccine. Mice were immunized with 5 × 107 IFU of AdC68-HATRBD using a prime-only or prime-boost regimen (Fig. 2a). Humoral immune responses to vaccination were determined by NAbs and binding antibodies (BAbs). Eight weeks post-vaccination (wpv), both prime-only and prime-boost regimens elicited RBD- and HA-specific immunoglobin (Ig) G antibodies in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (Fig. 2b). Compared to the prime-only regimen, the prime-boost regimen induced a substantial increase in the magnitude of IgG antibody responses. For mucosal IgA in the BALF, the prime-only regimen failed to generate anti-RBD and -HA IgA antibodies, while the prime-boost regimen significantly mobilized them.Fig. 2: The prime-boost regimen induces superior humoral immune responses.a Scheme of experiments. Mice (n = 10 per group) were immunized intranasally with 5 × 107 IFU of AdC68-HATRBD in prime-only or prime-boost regimen. The control group received a placebo (PBS).

In (c) and (d), the numbers after the up arrow indicate the median fold increase in antibody titer induced by prime-boost regimen compared with prime-only regimen. Data are represented as mean ± SEM (b) or GMT ± SD (c, d, f, and g). Significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey correction. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001.Full size imageSerum NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 were detectable following both regimens, displaying broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against prototype SARS-CoV-2 (WT) and VOCs (Beta, Delta, BA.1, BA.5, and XBB.1), although NAbs against BA.5 and XBB.1 were relatively feeble (Fig. 2c). Consistent with the BAb responses, the prime-boost regimen provoked higher NAb titers against all pseudoviruses compared to the prime-only regimen, with 0.95-fold to 9-fold increases for different variants. Furthermore, the live virus neutralization assay also demonstrated the superiority of the prime-boost regimen (Fig. 2d). There was a strong correlation between the 50% pseudovirus neutralization (pVNT50) titer and the 50% focus reduction neutralization (FRNT50) titer against WT and Delta strains (Fig. 2e), indicating that the pseudovirus neutralization assay reliably reflected the outcomes obtained through a live virus neutralization assay.Vaccine-induced protective antibodies against pH1N1 were evaluated through hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) activity and neutralizing capacity. The WHO and European Committee for Medicinal Products considered HAI titers of 1:40 or greater are protective27. A single dose of AdC68-HATRBD vaccine achieved this threshold, and the HAI titers further increased after the second dose (Fig. 2f, left). Similar trends were observed for the NAb responses, where the prime-boost regimen outperformed the prime-only regimen (Fig. 2f, right).We also valuated the ability of sera to neutralize AdC68 vector and found that AdC68-NAbs remained at baseline levels after i.n. priming but increased significantly after boosting (Fig. 3g). To further clarify the effect of pre-existing vector immunity on the efficacy of AdC68-HATRBD vaccine, mice were injected with AdC68-empty to induce vector-specific immunity, followed by i.n. immunization with two doses of AdC68-HATRBD (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Given the particularly high seroprevalence of human adenovirus serotype 5 (AdHu5) in humans28, the impact of pre-existing immunity to AdHu5 was evaluated using another set of mice pre-exposed to this virus. Strong BAb responses were observed in all vaccinated mice but not in unvaccinated controls (Supplementary Fig. 2b). When compared to non-exposed controls, mice pre-exposed to AdC68 or AdHu5 exhibited no reduction in the production of RBD- or HA-specific antibodies, suggesting that the antibody responses remained unaffected by pre-existing adenovirus immunity.Fig. 3: The prime-boost regimen triggers enhanced memory T-cell responses.a Scheme of experiments. The immunization schemes were identical to Fig. 2.

All data are represented as mean ± SEM and analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey correction. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01.Full size imageOverall, a single dose of AdC68-HATRBD stimulated modest humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1, which were enhanced to high levels by a homologous booster.The prime-boost regimen triggers enhanced memory T-cell responsesGiven the importance of potent cellular immune responses against SARA-CoV-2 and influenza virus for controlling and clearing the viruses29,30, we evaluated memory T-cell responses in mice following the prime-only and prime-boost regimens (Fig. 3a). Lymphocytes isolated from lung tissues were analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining assays using three sets of peptide pools: (i) an RBD peptide pool derived from BA.5, (ii) a TCEs peptide pool (Supplementary Table 1), and (iii) an HA peptide pool derived from pH1N1. The gating strategy for capturing the frequencies of T-cell subsets is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. At 8 wpv, significant IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T-cell responses specific for RBD, TCEs, and HA were observed in mice receiving the prime-boost regimen rather than the prime-only regimen (Fig. 3b). Concurrently, there was a notable increase in memory IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells upon re-stimulation with peptide pools for RBD, TCEs, or HA in the prime-boost group compared to control group (Fig. 3c). The prime-only regimen also developed memory IFN-γ+CD8+ T-cell responses comparable to the prime-boost regimen. A parallel experiment was performed to evaluate cellular immunity in the spleens. The i.n. immunization with AdC68-HATRBD induced mild splenic memory T-cell responses, with only modest activation of RBD-specific IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells in prime-boost group (Fig. 3d, e).Overall, i.n. immunization with AdC68-HATRBD drove antigen-specific T-cell immunity primarily in the lungs. A single dose of AdC68-HATRBD induced robust CD8+ but not CD4+ T-cell response, whereas the homologous i.n. booster augmented pH1N1- and SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immunity, resulting in the simultaneous activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The T-cell activation was markedly skewed toward Th1 phenotype characterized by prominent IFN-γ secretion.Intranasal vaccination with AdC68-HATRBD protects K18-hACE2 mice from BA.5.2 challengeWe next evaluate the protective capacity of AdC68-HATRBD in a SARS-CoV-2 challenge model. K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were intranasally vaccinated with 5 × 107 IFU of AdC68-HATRBD following a prime-only or prime-boost regimen and subsequently challenged with 1 × 105 focus-forming units (FFU) of BA.5.2 at 8 wpv (Fig. 4a). PBS-immunized mice lost >15% of their body weight, and three of six mice succumbed to infection by 5 days post-infection (dpi) (Fig. 4b, c). In contrast, the AdC68-HATRBD-immunized mice exhibited minor weight loss and survived until the end of the experiment, regardless of the vaccination regimen. Both prime-only and prime-boost regimens induced significant NAbs against live BA.5.2 (Fig. 4d). In line with the NAb responses observed in wild-type C57BL/6 J mice, the prime-boost regimen induced significantly higher BA.5.2-NAbs in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, with a 5.2-fold increase over the prime-only regimen.Fig. 4: Intranasal vaccination with AdC68-HATRBD protects K18-hACE2 mice from BA.5.2 challenge.a Scheme of vaccination and challenge. K18-hACE2 mice (n = 6 per group) were immunized intranasally with 5 × 107 IFU of AdC68-HATRBD using prime-only or prime-boost regimen. The control group received a placebo (PBS). At 8 weeks post-vaccination, mice were challenged with BA.5.2 and monitored for clinical signs and weight loss. Mouse serum was obtained to test for the neutralizing activity against BA.5.2 1 day prior to challenge. At 5 day post-infection, mice were euthanized, and tracheas and lung tissues were collected. b, c Percent weight loss (b) and percent survival (c) over 5 days post-infection. d Serum BA.5.2 neutralizing antibody titers prior to challenge.

Scale bar, 50 μm.Full size imageAt 5 dpi, the viral burden in the lungs and tracheas was assessed by quantifying the genomic RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic RNA (SgRNA) copies. The viral gRNA load in the lungs was considerably lower in the prime-boost group than control group, but not in the prime-only group. The gRNA reduction was also observed in the tracheas of all vaccinated mice (Fig. 4e). Consistent with the gRNA burden, the prime-only regimen lowered sgRNA copy number only in the tracheas, while the prime-boost regimen decreased sgRNA copy number in the lungs and tracheas (Fig. 4f). Histological analyses of the lung sections revealed significant acute inflammation in the control group (Fig. 4g, h). In contrast, mice immunized with the AdC68-HATRBD using the prime-only and prime-boost regimens had low overall pathology scores. Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed that viral gRNA/sgRNA loads in the lungs and tracheas as well as lung pathology scores were highly negatively related to the serum FRNT50 titers (Fig. 4i), demonstrating that the NAb level is an important predictor of vaccine efficacy.Collectively, these results indicated that i.n. immunization with AdC68-HATRBD protected K18-hACE2 mice from the lethal BA.5.2 challenge. A homologous booster was likely to provide better protection against BA.5.2 infection in both the lungs and tracheas.Intranasal vaccination with AdC68-HATRBD protects against a lethal pH1N1 challengeWe also assessed the ability of AdC68-HATRBD to protect mice from a lethal pH1N1 challenge. C57BL/6 J mice were immunized with AdC68-HATRBD using prime-only or prime-boost regimens and challenged with pH1N1 at 10 times the median lethal dose (LD50) at 8 wpv (Fig. 5a). PBS-immunized mice continuously lost weight and showed 100% mortality after challenge (Fig. 5b, c). In stark contrast, AdC68-HATRBD vaccine in prime-only and prime-boost regimens provided 100% protection against death and weight loss following a lethal pH1N1 challenge. Furthermore, vaccinated mice showed significantly reduced viral loads in the lungs and tracheas compared to the control group, regardless of the vaccination regimen (Fig. 5d). The tracheal viral load in the prime-boost group was 2.2 log10, which was 71-fold lower than in the prime-only group, although this decrease was not statistically significant. Histopathological analysis of lung sections at day 5 post-challenge revealed marked pathological changes in the control group, including bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and inflammatory cell infiltrates. In contrast, all vaccinated mice showed minimal histopathological changes (Fig. 5e). The overall lung pathological scores of the vaccinated mice in the prime-only or prime-boost regimens were comparable and significantly lower than those in the control group (Fig. 5f). These results demonstrate that i.n. immunization with AdC68-HATRBD protects mice from a lethal pH1N1 challenge. A homologous booster would confer more robust protection against BA.5.2 infection in the tracheas.Fig. 5: Intranasal vaccination with AdC68-HATRBD protects against a lethal pH1N1 challenge.a Scheme of vaccination and challenge. The immunization schemes were identical to Fig. 2. At 8 weeks post-vaccination, all mice were challenged with 10 × LD50 of pH1N1 virus. After the challenge, half of mice (n = 5 per group) were euthanized at 5 day post-infection with collection of tracheal and lung tissues, and the other half (n = 5 per group) were monitored for body weights and survival rates for 15 days. b, c Percent weight loss (b) and percent survival (c) over 15 days post-infection. d pH1N1 viral loads in mouse lungs (left) and tracheas (right) at 5 day post-infection. e Hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung sections at 5 day post-infection. f Pathology scores of the lungs at 5 day post-infection.

Scale bar, 50 μm.Full size image Heterologous AdC68-HATRBD booster reinforces and broadens the humoral immunity of licensed SARS-COV-2 vaccine Considering the widespread pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus acquired from infection or vaccination in humans, we further explored the potential of sequential immunization with licensed vaccines followed by our combination vaccine. First, we investigated whether AdC68-HATRBD could trigger more ideal immune responses as a heterologous booster after licensed COVID-19 vaccine priming. Three doses of the ZF2001 vaccine administered intramuscularly as primary immunization have been widely used in China and many other countries31. Owing to its safety and efficacy, this vaccine was also approved for booster immunization in China on December 13, 202232. We compared the immunogenicity of heterologous booster AdC68-HATRBD with that of homologous booster ZF2001 in mice previously vaccinated with ZF2001 (Fig. 6a). Homologous ZF2001/ZF2001 regimen exhibited high levels of WT-specific IgG but undetectable BA.5-specific IgG in the serum and BALF (Fig. 6b, c). In comparison, the heterologous ZF2001/AdC68-HATRBD regimen induced more robust IgG responses against WT and BA.5 RBD. The BALF IgA specific for WT and BA.5 were induced by the heterologous ZF2001/AdC68-HATRBD regimen, but not by the homologous ZF2001/ZF2001 regimen (Fig. 6d).Fig. 6: Heterologous AdC68-HATRBD booster reinforces and broadens the humoral immunity of licensed SARS-COV-2 vaccine.a Scheme of experiments. Mice were administrated three doses of 5 μg ZF2001 by i.m. route. After 4 weeks post-last vaccination, half of mice (n = 10 per group) received a homologous booster with 5 μg of ZF2001, the other half received a heterogenous i.n. booster with 5 × 107 IFU of AdC68-HATRBD. Serum and BALF were harvested at 12 weeks post-vaccination. b Serum RBD-specific lgG antibody responses to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (WT) and BA.5. c, d BALF RBD-specific lgG (c) and lgA (d) antibody responses to WT and BA.5. e Serum pseudovirus neutralizing antibody responses against WT and Omicron variants. f Serum live virus neutralizing antibody responses. Each dot represents data from two mice. In (e) and (f), values of geometric mean titer (GMT) are displayed, the red dashed line represents the lower limit of detection, and the numbers after the up arrow indicate the median fold increase in antibody titer induced by heterogenous vaccination compared with homologous vaccination. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (b–d) or GMT ± SD (e, f). Significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey correction. **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001.Full size imageSubsequently, the ability of serum to neutralize WT and Omicron strains was measured. As previously shown33, the homologous ZF2001/ZF2001 vaccination induced high titers of NAbs against WT and BA.2 strains, but exhibited minimal neutralizing activity against BA.5, BQ.1, and XBB.1 (Fig. 6e). Compared with the homologous ZF2001/ZF2001 group, the heterologous ZF2001/AdC68-HATRBD group showed stronger neutralizing activity, with 2.9-fold, 1.7-fold, 2.2-fold, 5.8-fold, and 8.0-fold increases in pVNT50 titers against WT, BA.2, BA.5, BQ.1, and XBB.1, respectively. Consistent with the pVNT50 results, the NAb titers against live BA.2 and BA.5.1 were higher in the heterologous group than in the homologous group (Fig. 6f). These results indicated that the heterologous ZF2001/AdC68-HATRBD regimen was superior in improving humoral immunity, despite a weaker increase of Omicron-NAb than WT-NAb, regardless of the vaccine regimen.Altogether, compared to a homologous booster, the heterologous booster with AdC68-HATRBD increased the magnitude and breadth of antibody responses, inducing mucosal lgA and broad-spectrum NAbs.Heterologous AdC68-HATRBD booster enhances the humoral and cell-mediated immunity of licensed influenza vaccineWe assessed the immunogenicity of the combination vaccine AdC68-HATRBD as a booster for the licensed influenza vaccine. Mice were immunized using a prime-only or prime-boost regimen, with the former receiving a single dose of a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV) intramuscularly and the latter receiving i.m. QIV followed by i.n. AdC68-HATRBD (Fig. 7a). Serum and BALF were collected at 8 wpv. HA-specific NAbs were detectable in the serum but not in the BAFL of QIV-immunized mice (Fig. 7b–d). The AdC68-HATRBD booster dramatically improved QIV-induced antibody responses, with increased serum IgG levels and the induction of BALF IgA and IgG.Fig. 7: Heterologous AdC68-HATRBD booster enhances the humoral and cell-mediated immunity of licensed influenza vaccine.a Scheme of experiments. Mice (n = 5 per group) were intramuscularly immunized with 3 μg of QIV. Four weeks later, the prime-boost group received a heterogenous i.n. booster with 5 × 107 IFU of AdC68-HATRBD. Eight weeks post-vaccination, serum, BALF, spleens, and lungs were collected. b Serum pH1N1 HA-specific lgG antibody titers. c, d BAFL pH1N1 HA-specific lgG (c) and lgA (d) antibody titers. e, f IL-4- and IFN-γ-secreting T cells specific for HA pool in the spleens (f) and lungs (g) were measured by ELISPOT assay. g Representative ELISpot showing HA-specific cytokines-secreting T cells. Each dot represents one animal. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Asterisks indicate significant difference between groups determined using one-way ANOVA with Tukey correction. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤ 0.0001.Full size imageWe further assessed cellular immune response in the spleens and lungs. The numbers of IL-4- and IFN-γ-secreting T cells specific for the HA pool were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay. A single dose of QIV was insufficient to activate splenic cellular immunity until AdC68-HATRBD was boosted (Fig. 7e–g). More specifically, compared with a single QIV vaccine dose, the AdC68-HATRBD booster elicited a 7.7-fold and 3.5-fold increase in splenic HA-specific IFN-γ and IL-4 responses, respectively. For pulmonary cellular immunity, the AdC68-HATRBD booster significantly rescued the low cellular response arising from QIV priming, activating IFN-γ responses.Overall, the weak immunogenicity of i.m. QIV can be enhanced by heterologous booster AdC68-HATRBD, resulting in robust mucosal and systemic immune responses, including antibodies and cellular immunity.DiscussionTo date, few studies have focused on developing a combined influenza/COVID-19 vaccine. Bao et al. found that co-inoculation with PiCoVacc (an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, Sinovac Biotech Ltd) and an inactivated influenza vaccine (Sinovac Biotech Ltd) provoked NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 and completely protected K18-hACE2 mice from H1N1 and ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infections34. Two doses of i.m. immunization with an mRNA-based combination vaccine containing HA and RBD protected mice against co-infection with H1N1 and the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants35. Insertion of RBD fused with the conserved stalk of H7N9 HA into an adenoviral vector yielded a combination vaccine that protected against lethal SARS-CoV-2 and H7N9 challenges36. Influenza viral vectors carrying the SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited strong protective immunity against H1N1 and SARS-CoV-237,38. Our study supports the effectiveness of the combination vaccine alone in preventing COVID-19 and influenza. Unlike the aforementioned studies, which were limited to ancestral RBD monomer or trimer, our study utilized two RBD heterodimers (a Beta-Alpha chimeric dimer and an Omicron-Delta chimeric dimer). In our study, AdC68-HATRBD, which carries two RBD heterodimers and conserved T-cell epitopes, induced broad-spectrum antibodies and cellular responses against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.With a low seroprevalence in humans19,39, AdC68 can induce strong adaptive immune responses against encoded antigens40,41,42, making it an attractive vaccine platform. However, the clinical use of adenovirus-based vaccines raises an important concern regarding the development of vector-specific immunity in vaccinated recipients, which may limit its use for boosting. In our study, we found that RBD- and HA-specific antibody responses induced by i.n. immunization with AdC68-HATRBD were not affected by pre-existing adenovirus immunity. Not coincidentally, previous studies have demonstrated that mucosal vaccination can bypass pre-existing immunity to adenovirus vector, thereby inducing potent immune responses specific for antigen43,44. In addition to varying immunization routes, numerous approaches are being extensively investigated to overcome adenoviral vector immunity. For example, covalent modification of adenoviral vectors using polymers such as polyethylene glycol and the macromolecular polysaccharide mannan can be effective in overcoming high-titer adenovirus-NAbs while retaining biological activity45,46. Encapsulation of adenoviral vectors with inert polymers, liposomes, and alginate microspheres has been shown to evade the vector-specific immune response47,48,49. Heterologous prime-boost immunization is also one way to address this problem50,51, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7.A heterologous prime-boost regimen has proven to be superior to a homologous regimen in promoting antibody responses52,53, owing to an elevated frequency of switched and activated antigen-specific memory B cells54. In addition to heterologous combinations of vaccines, the combination of i.m. and i.n. immunization routes may also contribute to improved protective immunity, as demonstrated in our previous work55. In the context of the widespread use of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, it is essential to evaluate combination vaccine candidates not only as standalone modalities but also with pre-existing immunity established by prior vaccination. Our work further demonstrates that the i.n. combination vaccine significantly enhances the protective immunity induced by licensed i.m. COVID-19 and influenza vaccines as a heterologous booster.Real-world studies on heterologous vaccine schemes have primarily focused on the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In their interim guidance on Nov 10, 2023, WHO makes the following recommendations for heterologous COVID-19 vaccination schedules: countries implementing inactivated vaccines for initial doses may consider using vectored or mRNA vaccines for booster doses; countries implementing vectored vaccines for initial doses may consider using mRNA or protein subunit vaccines for booster doses; countries implementing mRNA vaccines for initial doses may consider using vectored or protein subunit vaccines for booster doses5. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that among individuals received two doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines, boosting with adenovirus vectored or mRNA vaccines provoked considerably stronger immune responses than in those boosted with inactivated vaccine56,57. A phase 2 trial comparing seven COVID-19 vaccines as a third booster showed an overall increase in reactogenicity of three vaccines: mRNA-1273 after ChAdOx1-S/ChAdOx1-S or BNT162b2/BNT162b2; and ChAdOx1-S and Ad26.COV2.S after BNT162b2/BNT162b258. Obviously, our AdC68-HATRBD may be considered a booster dose for those who have received an inactivated, protein subunit or mRNA vaccine, in addition to being used in a one- or two-dose initial vaccination schedule. Noteworthy, following ChAdOx1-S/ChAdOx1-S, ChAdOx1-S did not enhance cellular responses, and antibody responses, although improved, were inferior to those of mRNA or protein subunit vaccines58. One of the reasons might be that the vector-specific immunity induced by initial doses impaired the immune responses to the homologous booster. The ChAdOx1-S vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection, a delivery route that cannot bypass pre-existing adenovirus immunity. Our study revealed that the antibody responses induced by i.n. immunization with AdC68-HATRBD was not hindered by pre-existing vector immunity in a mouse model, but the extent to which the results of immune responses in mice predict human outcomes of vaccination remains uncertain.Next-generation vaccine is a promising strategy for combating the continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, immune imprinting may pose a challenge to the effectiveness of vaccination against variants. The immune response to Omicron subvariants could be compromised by immune imprinting in individuals who already have immunity against prototype or prototype-like strains through infection or vaccination59,60. Although booster vaccination with the prototype/BA.5 bivalent mRNA vaccine enhanced the antibody response to the Omicron subvariants, the neutralizing capacity against the Omicron subvariants remained much lower than against the prototype strain61. The immune imprinting phenomenon was also observed in our study, i.e., mice primed with ZF2001 and then boosted with AdC68-HATRBD maintained higher antibody titers against the prototype strain than Omicron subvariants (Fig. 6). In further study, we should probably discard prototype or prototype-like immunogens from the COVID-19 vaccine components to minimize the adverse effects of immune imprinting. For example, updating our AdC68-HATRBD vaccine by replacing the two chimeric RBD-dimers with the sequence from circulating Omicron subvariants such as XBB.1, EG.5, BA.2.86, and JN.1.To control respiratory viral infections, mucosal immune responses at the site of infection, including NAbs, IgA, IgG, and virus-specific T cells, are critical18,62. Systemic IgG is effective in targeting viruses in the lungs but is usually much less so in the upper respiratory tract63. IgA is the hallmark of mucosal immunity, which hinders viral entry into the host cells by neutralizing viruses on mucosal surfaces, thereby establishing a first line of defense64. In our study, similar to other licensed i.m. vaccines65,66, mucosal IgA was poorly induced when vaccinated with only ZF2001 or QIV vaccines but remarkably activated after AdC68-HATRBD boosting, thus compensating for the shortcomings of licensed vaccines in inducing mucosal immunity.Conventional SARS-CoV-2 and influenza vaccines based on inactivated virions or viral protein fragments, such as PiCoVacc, BBIBP-CorV, and NVX-CoV2373, are effective in inducing antibody responses, but not T-cell responses, particularly CD8+ T cells67,68,69,70. Next-generation vaccines based on mRNA or viral vectors, such as BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, Ad26.COV2.S, and ChAdOx1-S, can simultaneously induce robust humoral and cellular immune responses as they mimic viral infection by expressing antigens after immunization71. Indeed, AdC68-HATRBD but not QIV vaccine, elicited robust SARS-CoV-2- and influenza-specific Th1-biased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Notably, these responses were observed primarily in the lungs but not spleens. The weakness of i.n. AdC68-HATRBD to activate splenic T cells was altered in influenza vaccine-primed mice, although the licensed i.m. influenza vaccine alone did not induce a splenic cellular immune response. A study of T cell immunity in different human organs suggested that the lungs contained markedly higher frequencies of influenza- and respiratory syncytial virus-specific CD8+ T cells than the circulation72. Knudson et al. further demonstrated dramatic differences in the localization of T cell responses within the lung parenchyma between respiratory and systemic viruses, that is, most T cells are localized to the pulmonary vasculature following i.n. infection with a systemic pathogen, whereas T cells are primarily localized to the lung tissue (also known as lung tissue-resident memory T cells [TRM]) following a respiratory viral infection73. Given that the adenoviral vector AdC68 is also a respiratory virus, it is no wonder that i.n. immunization with AdC68-HATRBD would provoke primarily pulmonary T-cell responses, and it is logical to assume that a large number of TRM cells are included in these antigen-specific T cells. Our recent study showed that an AdC68-based COVID-19 vaccine mounted SARS-CoV-2-specific lung TRM cell responses through i.n. rather than i.m. immunization55.Unlike antibody responses that are susceptible to viral mutations, T-cell immunity remains largely unaffected. Thus far, evidence indicates that highly infectious Omicron variants evade NAbs induced by vaccination or infection with other variants, thereby greatly increasing the prevalence of breakthrough infection. However, the vast majority of T cell responses to Omicron are preserved, which may contribute to the reduced clinical severity74,75. The same is true for the anti-influenza immune response76,77. The potent induction of pulmonary SARS-CoV-2- and influenza-specific T cells by AdC68-HATRBD may be beneficial for protection against circulating strains and potential future variants.In conclusion, i.n. immunization with AdC68-HATRBD, which is cost-effective and easy to implement in pandemic settings, is immunogenic and protective against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza in mice. Maintaining this vaccine candidate as part of a heterologous regimen with the licensed SARS-CoV-2 and influenza vaccines may be a promising strategy to improve adaptive immune responses induced by primary vaccination, resulting in comprehensive protective immunity.MethodsCells and virusesHEK-293, 293 T, Huh7, MDCK, and VeroE6 cells were all cultured in growth media (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. SARS-CoV-2 wild-type SH01 strain (GenBank: MT121215), Delta, BA.2, BA.5.1, and BA.5.2 were obtained from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention after isolation from patients in Shanghai, China. The pH1N1 influenza virus was provided by the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center of Fudan University (Shanghai, China). The pH1N1 virus was created using reverse genetics and contained six gene segments from the A/PR8 virus and HA and NA genes from A/Califomia/7/2009. Mouse Six- to eight-week-old female C57BL/6 J and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) and GemPharmatech Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China), respectively. All experiments involving live SARS-CoV-2 were conducted in the animal biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities of Fudan University following International Standard Operating Procedures. All influenza virus experiments were performed in the BSL-2 facilities of the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center of Fudan University following the standard operating protocols approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University. All animal studies that did not involve pathogenic pathogens were performed in SPF facilities, with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tianjin Medical University (Tianjin, China).Vaccine constructionThe recombinant AdC68 vector was engineered by deleting the E1/E3 gene and replacing the E4-orf6/7-orf4 gene with AdHu5 equivalents. The Beta-Alpha chimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD dimer consisted of one Beta RBD (spike protein residues 319–541, GenBank: MZ410518.1) and one Alpha RBD (S protein residues 319–541, GenBank: OM443028.1) connected in tandem repeats. Omicron-Delta chimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD dimer comprises one Omicron RBD (spike protein residues 319–541, GenBank: OP315382.1) and one Delta RBD (S protein residues 319–541, GenBank: ON908696.1) connected in tandem repeats. The tandem conserved TCEs from ORF1, ORF3, and M proteins of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 are shown in Supplementary Table 1. The full-length HA gene sequence was based on pH1N1 (GenBank: ACP41953.1). These codon-optimized genes encoding the aforementioned transgene were inserted into the ∆E1 region of the AdC68 vector under the transcriptional control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter and the SV-40 polyadenylation sequence.AdC68-HATRBD was packaged, rescued, and amplified in HEK293 cells and subsequently purified by cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation. The infectious units of recombinant adenoviruses were titrated on HEK293 cells using QuickTiter™ Adenovirus Titer Immunoassay Kit (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.Immunization and challengeMice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal tribromoethanol and then intranasally vaccinated with 5 × 107 IFU of AdC68-HATRBD in a 15 μl volume. In the heterologous vaccination experiments, 5 μg of ZF2001 or 3 μg of QIV through i.m. route was administered. The control group received a placebo (PBS). At the end point of experiments, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and the BALF, spleens, and/or lungs were harvested. In Figs. 2, 3, and 6, each dot represents data from two mice. That is to say, the specimens were mixed from two mice, including BALF, serum and lymphocytes. In other animal experiments, each point represents data from one mouse.Challenge was carried out with 1 × 105 FFU of BA.5.2 or 10 × LD50 of pH1N1 administered intranasally. Mice were monitored daily for clinical signs and weight loss, with 70% of their initial weight considered a humane endpoint. To measure viral loads, the trachea and half a fraction of lung tissue were harvested on day 5 post-infection and immediately frozen in dry ice and stored at −80 °C until processed. The other half of the lung tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for hematoxylin-eosin staining.Western blotHEK293 cells were transduced with 105, 106, or 107 IFU of AdC68-HATRBD. AdC68-empty-transduced (107 IFU) HEK293 cells were used as controls. Twenty-four hours post-infection, the transduced cells were harvested and boiled at 100 °C with 1 × reductive loading buffer for 15 min. Western blotting was performed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody (1:2000 dilution, 40592-T62; Sino Biological, Beijing, China) or anti-influenza A HA antibody (1:5000 dilution, 86001-RM01; Sino Biological, Beijing, China), followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000 dilution, ab6721; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). β-actin was selected as the internal control (1:5000 dilution, HRP-60008; Proteintech, Wuhan, China). Blots and gels derived from the same or side-by-side experiments were processed together. The un-cropped and unprocessed western blot images are provided as Supplementary Fig. 4.Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for binding antibody measurementsThe IgG and IgA antibody levels in mouse serum and BALF were measured by ELISA, as previously described55. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with RBD protein of WT or BA.5 strain or HA protein of pH1N1 (100 ng/well, Sino Biological, Beijing, China). For lgG detection, serum samples were threefold serially diluted with 1:400 starting dilutions, and BALF samples were twofold serially diluted with 1:5 starting dilutions. For IgA detection, BALF samples were twofold serially diluted using an undiluted stock solution as the starting dilutions. Following 2-h incubation at 37 °C, secondary antibodies were added: HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:100000 dilution, ab6789; Abcam, Cambridge, UK); HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgA (1:5000 dilution, 1040-05; Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA). Plates were again incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of TMB substrate (NCM Biotech, Suzhou, China). Sulfuric acid (2 M H2SO4) solution was used to stop the reaction. The optical density (OD)450–630 was recorded using a microplate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). The binding antibody endpoint titer was determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that yielded an absorbance greater or equal to 0.1 OD unit above the absorbance of the pre-immune samples.Production of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirusesSARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were produced as previously described78,79. Briefly, the backbone plasmid pNL4-3.Luc.R-E and pCAGGS-S-CΔ19 expressing spike of the WT strain or its variants were cotransfected into HEK 293 T cells by polyethyleneimine (Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA). The spike amino acid sequences of WT strain and its variants were based on GISAID EPI_ISL_402124 (Wuhan/WIV04/2019), EPI_ISL_712096 (Beta variant), EPI_ISL_2029113 (Delta variant), EPI_ISL_6640916 (BA.1 variant), EPI_ISL_8515362 (BA.2 variant), EPI_ISL_13241867 (BA.5 variant), EPI_ISL_15812431 (BQ.1 variant), or EPI_ISL_14917761 (XBB.1 variant). The supernatant was collected 48 h post-transfection, filtered through 0.45 µm filters, and concentrated overnight with PEG 8000 at 4 °C.Pseudovirus titration was performed based on HIV-1 p24 antigen quantification utilizing Lentivirus Quantitation Kit (Beijing Biodragon Immunotechnologies Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions; 1 × 108 lentivirus particles per well were used for the pseudovirus neutralization test.SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assayHuh7 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells per well in opaque 96-well flat-bottom plates. Twenty-four hours later, each serum sample was threefold serially diluted and mixed with an equal volume of pseudoviruses. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before adding to Huh7 cells. Relative luciferase activity (RLA) was measured after 48 h using the SteadyGlo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The pVNT50 titer was calculated as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which RLA was reduced by 50% compared to the RLA in virus control wells infected with pseudovirus in the absence of mouse serum. The lower limit of detection (LLD) of the neutralization assay was 20, and measurements below the LLD were assigned half the LLD.SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assaySerum samples were threefold serially diluted in 96 well U-bottom plates. An equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 consisting of WT strain, Delta, BA.2, BA.5.1, or BA.5.2 was then added to the diluted serum. The serum-virus mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before transferring to 96-well plates with 4 × 104 VeroE6 cells per well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 h, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. The plates were washed and incubated with rabbit anti-N antibody (1:2000 dilution, A18797; Abclonal, Wuhan, China), followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution, AS014; Abclonal, Wuhan, China) and peroxidase substrate (Seracare, Milford, MA, USA). Virus-infected cell foci were counted using an ImmunoSpot microanalyzer (CTL, Shaker Heights, OH, USA). The FRNT50 titer was measured as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which foci were reduced by 50% relative to the control wells infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of mouse serum. The LLD of the neutralization assay was 10, and measurements below the LLD were assigned half the LLD.Influenza virus neutralization assayThe influenza virus-specific neutralization activity of mouse serum was analyzed using a micro-neutralization assay in MDCK cells. A two-fold serial dilution of serum samples was performed in a 96-well plate and incubated with 100 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) of pH1N1 at 37 °C for 1 h. The MDCK culture media was then replaced with the mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The culture supernatants were then cultured with same volume of 1% chicken red blood cells diluted in PBS and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The neutralizing titer was the highest dilution of serum that inhibited virus-induced hemagglutination. The LLD of the neutralization assay was 10, and measurements below the LLD were assigned half the LLD.Haemagglutination-inhibition assaySerum samples were treated with a receptor-destroying enzyme from Vibrio cholerae (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C overnight, followed by heat-inactivation at 56 °C for 30 min. Serial serum dilutions were mixed with four hemagglutination units of inactivated pH1N1 virus in 96 well V-bottom plates for 1 h. The 1% chicken red blood cells diluted in PBS were added to each well, and the wells were incubated for 15 min before analysis. The reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that prevented complete hemagglutination was considered the HAI titer. The LLD of the HAI assay was 10, and measurements below the LLD were assigned half the LLD.Adenovirus neutralization assayAs previously described, 5 × 104 cells per well A549 were seeded in 96-well overnight. A threefold dilution series of the test sera were mixed with an equivalent volume of 1 × 107 vp AdC68-Luc. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the mixture was added to A549 cells. Two days later, RLA was measured. The NT50 titer was calculated as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which RLA was reduced by 50% compared to the RLA in virus control wells infected with AdC68-Luc in the absence of mouse serum. The LLD of the neutralization assay was 10, and measurements below the LLD were assigned half the LLD.Flow cytometryAs previously described40,80, the mononuclear cells from lungs and spleens were isolated and stimulated with 2 µg/mL of the RBD, TCEs, or HA pool in the presence of GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 12 h. The RBD peptide pool contained 15-mers overlapping by 11 amino acids derived from the BA.5 variant. The TCEs peptide pool contained 24 epitope peptides (Supplementary Table 1). The HA peptide pool contained 15-mers overlapping by 11 amino acids derived from pH1N1. Upon stimulation, cells were blocked with Fc block (1:250 dilution, 14-0161-85; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and simultaneously stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then stained with four surface markers containing PerCP/Cyanine5.5-CD3ε (1:500 dilution, 100328; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), APC-Cy7-CD4 (1:250 dilution, A15384; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), Alexa Fluor 700-CD8a (1:250 dilution, 100730; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), and FITC-CD44 (1:250 dilution, 48-0621-80; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by fixation and permeabilization using fixation/permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, United States) following the manufacturer’s instruction. Fixed/permeabilized cells were incubated with a cocktail of fluorescently labeled cytokine antibodies containing APC-IFN-γ (1:250 dilution, 505810; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), Brilliant Violet 421-TNF-α (1:500 dilution, 506328; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), PE-IL-13 (1:250 dilution, 159403; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), and PE-Cy7-IL-4 (1:250 dilution, 504118; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) for 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, samples were fixed with 2% PFA for 30 min before the acquisition, then acquired on a BD LSRFortessa (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) and analyzed using FlowJo v10.ELISpot assaySingle cells of spleens and lungs were isolated to determine the number of cytokines-producing cells using Mouse IFN-γ ELISpotBASIC kit and Mouse IL-4 ELISpotBASIC kit (MabTech, Nacka Strand, Sweden) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, Multiscreen IP ELISpot plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) were coated with respective capture antibody overnight at 4 °C. After blocking and washing, 1 × 106 cells and 2 µg/ml HA pool were added to each well of the plate, and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Spot counts were performed using an ImmunoSpot microanalyzer (CTL, Shaker Heights, OH, USA). The results are presented as the number of spot-forming unit (SFU) per well.Viral load determinationThe loads of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in the tracheas and lungs were quantified using quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction from the RNA samples prepared as described above. For SARS-CoV-2, two sets of primers were used to detect the N gene of the viral genome and the E gene of sgRNA.N Forward: 5′-GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT-3′;N Reverse: 5′-CTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG-3;N-probe: FAM-ACCCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACC-TAMRA;E Forward: 5′-CGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTC-3′;E Reverse: 5′-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA-3′;E-probe: FAM-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-TAMRA.SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were expressed on a log10 scale as viral copies per gram after calculation with a standard curve.For influenza virus, the matrix (M) gene amplicon was quantified using the following primers:M Forward: 5′-AAGACCAATCCTGTCACCTCTGA-3′;M Reverse: 5′-CAAAGCGTCTACGCTGCAGTCC-3.Ct values were normalized to the calibrator mouse gene GAPDH.Genome was extracted from lungs and nasal turbinates using TIANamp Genomic DNA kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China). The genome load of AdC68-HATRBD was quantified by RT-qPCR using the Roche LightCycler® 480 system. The primer sequences to detect the hexon gene of AdC68 were:Hexon Forward: 5′-GCCCTTCCACATCCAGGTGC-3′;Hexon Reverse: 5′-CCATGGGGAAGAAGGTGGCG-3′;AdC68-HATRBD load was expressed as viral copies per gram after calculation with a standard curve.HistopathologyPFA-fixed lung tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned into 4 µm-thick, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. According to previous study41, histopathological changes were scored from 1 to 5 based on the degree of interalveolar edema, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, and neutrophil infiltration.Statistical analysisAll data are presented as means ± SEM unless otherwise stated, and asterisks and pound signs in the figures indicate statistical significance (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001). All experimental data used to compare differences among groups were analyzed via one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Getting a flu vaccine can help keep you healthy and prevent more serious illness from flu. If you have CKD and get flu symptoms, call your doctor right away. CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people with CKD who have flu infection or suspected flu infection. Background People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications, which can result in hospitalization and even death. This is because CKD weakens immune response, which can make the immune system less able to fight infections. People with CKD at any stage, people who have had a kidney transplant, and people who are undergoing dialysis treatment are all at increased risk of severe illness from flu. What is Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)?‎ More than 1 in 7 U.S. adults are estimated to have CKD, a condition in which the kidneys are damaged and cannot filter blood as well as they should. Excess fluid and waste from the blood remain in the body and may cause other health problems. Diabetes and high blood pressure are major risk factors for CKD.For more information: If You Have Kidney Disease, You Need to Get a Flu Shot This Fall Vaccination is the best protection against flu Flu vaccination is especially important for people with CKD because they are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. Flu vaccination has been shown to reduce the risk of having a serious flu outcome like a stay in the hospital or even being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Among people with CKD, flu vaccination has been associated with reduced hospitalizations. Flu vaccines for people with CKD Injectable influenza vaccines are recommended for use in people with CKD and other health conditions. Flu vaccinations have a long, established safety record and studies support the safety of flu vaccines in people with CKD. The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also known as the nasal spray vaccine, is not recommended for people with CKD because the safety and effectiveness of this vaccine in people with CKD has not been established. Your doctor or other health care provider can answer any questions you might have about flu vaccine. Keep Reading: Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine [LAIV] (The Nasal Spray Flu Vaccine)Pneumococcal vaccination is also important Having flu increases your risk of getting pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death. People who have CKD should also be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination. This vaccination helps protect against pneumococcal pneumonia and other serious infections. You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine. Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you. Talk with your health care provider about other vaccines, including the hepatitis B vaccine, you may need if you have CKD. Keep Reading: What Vaccines are Recommended for You Other preventive actions for people with CKD Like everyone else, in addition to getting a flu vaccine, people with CKD should take everyday preventive actions, including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces. Keep Reading: Preventive Actions to Help Protect Against FluSpecific health actions for people with CKD Maintain a two-week supply of your regular medications during flu season. Do not stop taking your regular medications without first consulting your doctor, especially in the event that you become sick with flu or another respiratory infection. If you have CKD and get flu symptoms, call your doctor right away. CDC recommends prompt flu treatment for people with CKD who have flu infection or suspected flu infection.

Bar Chart 887519 Market Overview Producing, developing and distributing developing and disseminating instruments, tests, and technologies to identify and diagnose influenza virus infections is the main objective of the influenza diagnostic market. These diagnostic instruments are intended for use in various environments, such as point-of-care facilities, clinics, hospitals, and labs. At the local, national, and international levels, influenza diagnostics aid in the surveillance and monitoring of influenza activity. Public health officials may effectively allocate resources and adopt targeted control measures to lessen the impact of seasonal influenza outbreaks and pandemics by monitoring influenza virus circulation and detecting new strains. According to the WHO, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for 41 million annual deaths worldwide, or 74% of all fatalities. In January 2024, Alveo Technologies, Inc. said it is collaborating with leaders and specialists in the poultry sector to develop a quick and precise in-field multiplex panel that would test for all pertinent avian influenza strains, with an initial emphasis on H5, H7, and H9. Alveo has collaborated with leading companies in the field, including x-OvO, Pharmsure International Ltd., and Royal GD, to co-develop and commercialize the tests. In the first half of 2024, the company plans to launch its first product in the poultry diagnostic market in EMEA. Influenza Diagnostic Market Growth Factors There is a growing need for precise and dependable influenza testing since early diagnosis enables timely treatment and better patient outcomes. Public health initiatives and government assistance for influenza surveillance and control efforts boost relevant diagnostic tool sales, promoting the growth of the influenza diagnostic market. Global seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks persist, necessitating efficient diagnostic instruments for appropriate management and containment. The creation of portable, user-friendly diagnostic tests that enable quicker diagnosis and treatment initiation outside of conventional healthcare facilities expands the market reach. The development of new and improved diagnostic techniques, such as molecular assays and rapid antigen testing, increases the acceptance of these techniques by providing faster results, higher accuracy, and greater user-friendliness. Market Scope Report Coverage Details Growth Rate from 2024 to 2034 CAGR of 6% Global Market Size in 2023 USD 1.69 Billion Global Market Size in 2024 USD 1.79 Billion Global Market Size by 2034 USD 3.21Billion U.S. Market Size in 2023 USD 410 Million U.S. Market Size by 2034 USD 800 Million Base Year 2023 Forecast Period 2024 to 2034 Segments Covered By Test Type and By End-use Regions Covered North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa Market Dynamics Drivers Increasing prevalence of influenza Apart from seasonal influenza, new strains of the virus can potentially produce influenza pandemics worldwide. For example, the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 demonstrated how quickly influenza can spread over the world and cause massive disease and fatalities. The possibility of fresh pandemics is a persistent worry as new influenza strains develop. Early diagnosis and containment are crucial in stopping the spread of new influenza viruses and lessening their adverse effects on public health, and this requires the deployment of effective diagnostic technologies. Thereby, the rising prevalence of influenza is observed to act as a major driver for the influenza diagnostic market. Governments and public health organizations acknowledge the significance of implementing readiness measures to lessen the impact of influenza epidemics. Developing a strong diagnostic infrastructure is essential to pandemic preparedness plans. Rising demand for faster diagnostic test for influenza Influenza outbreaks can present serious problems for public health, especially when they coincide with pandemics or seasonal highs. Quick diagnostic tests make illness surveillance, outbreak containment, and epidemiological monitoring more effective for public health authorities. These diagnostics reduce the amount of influenza that spreads throughout communities and healthcare facilities by promptly detecting and separating cases. Diagnostic delays may occur from the sample collection, transit to a central laboratory, and subsequent processing involved in traditional laboratory-based procedures for influenza. The benefit of rapid diagnostic testing is that answers can be obtained in minutes, significantly minimizing patient wait periods. Thereby, considering the demand for diagnostic test for influenza acts as a major driver for the influenza diagnostic market. Restraints Variabilities in test sensitivity and specificity Influenza is a highly transmissible respiratory disease that can cause serious complications, particularly in susceptible groups like the elderly, small children, and people with underlying medical disorders. Therefore, prompt treatment and management depend heavily on precise and trustworthy diagnostic testing. Variations in sensitivity and specificity can potentially provide erroneous results, including missed diagnoses or false positives or negatives. The precision of influenza diagnostic tests is essential to manage outbreaks and monitor public health. Test sensitivity and specificity variations can impact the validity of surveillance data, making it difficult for public health officials to precisely monitor the virus's spread, implement the necessary controls, and deploy resources during influenza seasons or pandemics. Thereby, such concerns related to sensitivity and specificity act as a major restraint for the influenza diagnostic market. Variability in test accuracy may damage the public's confidence in influenza diagnostic tests and healthcare systems. Test results may cause patients and healthcare professionals to lose faith in them, which could result in a decline in the uptake of advised preventative measures like immunization and infection control procedures. Stringent regulatory guidelines Regulatory standards require strict quality control procedures to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of influenza diagnostic tests. Manufacturers must implement comprehensive quality management systems to oversee and regulate all facets of the production process, from acquiring raw materials to distributing finished products. To reduce the possibility of contamination, quality variations, or product faults, adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) is crucial. The company's reputation and financial health may suffer in the event of regulatory penalties, product recalls, or market withdrawal resulting from noncompliance with these criteria. Opportunities Increasing number of patients acquiring infections The rising number of patients acquiring infections is observed to open a lucrative opportunity for the influenza diagnostic market. There is a growing need for precise and effective diagnostic tests as the number of patients getting infections rises. Being a highly contagious respiratory disease, influenza must be diagnosed as soon as possible to start treatment and stop the sickness from spreading. The market for influenza diagnostics is set up for success by this spike in demand. The infrastructure for providing healthcare, which includes clinics, hospitals, and laboratories, has been steadily growing in many areas. Patients with influenza-like symptoms now have easier access to diagnostic services thanks to the expansion of healthcare facilities. Furthermore, point-of-care testing equipment promotes decentralized testing, facilitating prompt diagnosis and treatment in various healthcare settings and supporting market expansion. Advancements in genomic and proteomic technologies Detailed characterization of influenza virus strains, including genetic diversity, antigenic characteristics, and treatment resistance profiles, is made possible by proteomic and genome technologies. This data is crucial for tracking the transmission of viruses across various geographic locations, keeping an eye out for the appearance of novel influenza strains, and helping to choose vaccine variants. These technological advancements aid in creating more potent diagnostic tools and vaccinations by offering comprehensive insights into the genomic and proteomic composition of influenza viruses. Thereby, technological advancements are observed to act as an opportunity for the influenza diagnostic market. Test Type Insights The RIDT segment dominated and sustained to be the fastest growing in the influenza diagnostic market. The Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Test (RIDT) is efficient for patients and healthcare providers since it provides fast findings, usually in 15 to 30 minutes. This quick response time is essential for controlling influenza epidemics because it enables prompt identification and proper treatment or containment measures. Technology has advanced to the point that influenza viruses may now be accurately detected thanks to RIDTs' increased sensitivity and specificity. They may not be as sensitive as molecular tests conducted in laboratories, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), but they provide a fast enough screening and diagnosis. End-use Insights The hospitals segment dominated the influenza diagnostic market share at 48% in 2023. Emergency departments and urgent care clinics are in hospitals and serve patients who need to be seen immediately, including those with severe influenza symptoms or complications. Hospitals play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating influenza cases, and these facilities carry out quick diagnostic tests and offer prompt therapies. It uses a broad group of medical specialists with specific training and experience in detecting infectious disorders such as influenza, including pathologists, physicians, laboratory technicians, and microbiologists. These experts play a critical role in correctly recognizing and diagnosing influenza cases and ensuring the right course of action is taken. The POCT segment is the fastest-growing in the influenza diagnostic market during the forecast period. Point-of-care testing (POCT) provides patients, healthcare professionals, and laboratories with accessibility and convenience. POCT devices allow for real-time, on-site testing, unlike conventional laboratory-based testing procedures that call for samples to be sent off-site for processing. This shortens turnaround times, avoids substantial sample transportation requirements, and enables timely patient management decision-making. Comparing POCT to conventional laboratory-based testing procedures reveals significant cost savings. POCT devices facilitate healthcare processes and maximize resource utilization by removing the need for sample transportation, lowering personnel costs related to sample processing, and decreasing the usage of pricey laboratory equipment. Because of its affordability, POCT is a desirable choice for medical professionals and organizations looking for reliable and accurate diagnostics at a reasonable cost.

It's the first time bird flu has been found in ruminants in the U.S. (Jessica Armbruster — Getty Images/iStockphoto/The Minnesota Star Tribune)CommentGiftShareListenBird flu has reached goats for the first time, a development officials call significant in the nationwide outbreak that began two years ago.Several baby goats in western Minnesota died earlier this month after being infected with the same strain of avian influenza that has killed millions of birds across the country since 2022, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health announced this week.While bird flu has found its way to mammals like dogs and skunks before, this is the first time in the United States the virus has been found in a ruminant — a group of animals that includes cattle, sheep and goats.“It highlights the possibility of the virus infecting other animals on farms with multiple species,” state veterinarian Dr. Brian Hoefs said in a statement. “Thankfully, research to date has shown mammals appear to be dead-end hosts, which means they’re unlikely to spread [the virus] further.”A backyard flock of 23 chickens and ducks in Stevens County was depopulated in February after the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was found in the birds. Not long after, the owner reached out to state officials about “unusual deaths of newly kidded goats,” which shared the same space and water source as the poultry flock, according to the animal health board.Five of the 10 goat kids that died, which were all younger than two weeks old, tested positive for bird flu, according to a report filed at the World Organisation for Animal Health.The U.S. Department of Agriculture is working with the state Board of Animal Health to investigate the transmission.“The risk to the public is extremely low, and any risk of infection is limited to people in direct contact with infected animals,” the board said. “To date, no people in the United States have become ill following contact with mammals infected with this virus.”The larger risk comes from increased animal-to-animal transmission, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.“The evolution of the virus makes it much more likely to infect other species,” he said. “It’s not surprising that we’re going to see other mammals living close to other species get infected.”But as the virus has mutated since it first appeared in Hong Kong in 1997, it has become less of a threat to humans, Osterholm said. “We’re watching this closely, things could change tomorrow, but for now there is low risk for human transmission.”Related CoverageBusinessBird flu cases slow in Minnesota, but egg producers elsewhere hit againThere has not been an outbreak at a commercial poultry farm in Minnesota since late December. Statewide, more than 6 million birds, mostly turkeys, have died from the virus or been culled to prevent its spread since early 2022.Minnesota is the nation’s leading turkey producer, and it lies in a major migration pathway. Scientists say migrating waterfowl are the main source of bird flu transmission. The extremely contagious virus can travel on dust particles for miles through the air, and the virus is present in the fecal matter of infected birds.Those with backyard poultry flocks are urged to follow strict biosecurity guidelines, especially as the spring migration picks up.“Animals with weakened or immature immune systems, like the goat kids in this case, are at higher risk of contracting disease,” the board said. “Biosecurity is the first line of defense for anyone to protect their animals from disease and includes simple measures like cleaning equipment and housing regularly, separating livestock from wild animals, and calling your veterinarian when animals appear sick.”ShareCommentabout the writerBrooks JohnsonFood and Manufacturing ReporterBrooks Johnson is a business reporter covering Minnesota’s food industry, 3M and manufacturing trends.See MoreMore from BusinessSee MoreBusinessBremer Bank reportedly for sale, months after settling long dispute with Otto Bremer Trust Mike HughlettBusinessBremer Bank reportedly for sale, months after settling long dispute with Otto Bremer Trust Mike HughlettThe bank has hired financial advisers to look for a buyer, according to Bloomberg News.

PDF FILE In recent months, the U.S. poultry industry has faced significant challenges due to an outbreak of avian influenza. This highly contagious viral disease has had far-reaching consequences for both producers and consumers. Let’s delve into the details of this critical situation. The Avian Influenza disease Virus (AIV) belongs to the species influenza virus type A, family Orthomyxoviridae, genus Alphainfluenzavirus based on the International Committee of Viral Taxonomy. Previous highly pathogenic outbreaks of AI (HPAI) were thought to be the result of flock exposure to a lowly pathogenic strain of AI (LPAI) and during the infection process the virus mutated to the more detrimental HPAI strain. The Avian Flu Crisis Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has been a recurring concern for poultry farmers worldwide. However, the current outbreak, which began in early 2022, has been particularly severe in the United States. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), nearly 82 million birds, primarily egg-laying chickens, have been culled across 47 states to prevent further spread of the virus. The impact has been devastating for farmers, leading to significant economic losses and disruptions in the supply chain. Economic Consequences Egg Prices Soar: More than 40 million egg-laying hens have been culled in the U.S., causing egg prices nationwide to skyrocket. Consumers have felt the pinch as they pay higher prices for this essential protein source. Record High Turkey Meat Costs: The previous “bird flu” outbreak drove the cost of turkey meat to record highs. Commercial poultry farms faced extended periods of downtime, affecting production and availability. Brazilian Poultry Tariffs Eliminated: In response to the crisis, China has eliminated tariffs on Brazilian poultry, potentially impacting U.S. poultry exports. The U.S. poultry industry is closely monitoring these developments. Scientific Efforts and Consumer Awareness Pathogen Reduction Technology: USDA scientists have been working diligently to develop technology that reduces pathogens in intact eggs. This research aims to enhance product safety and protect consumers from diseases like Salmonella. Consumer Protection: The USDA has finalized a voluntary “Product of USA” label claim for poultry products. This label is meant to enhance consumer protection by providing clear information about the origin of poultry products. ConclusionContinue after advertising. The avian influenza outbreak has underscored the vulnerability of the U.S. poultry industry to infectious diseases. As farmers continue to grapple with the crisis, scientific advancements and consumer awareness play crucial roles in mitigating the impact. The industry must remain vigilant and collaborate to safeguard both poultry health and consumer well-being.

(WOWT) - A case of Influenza B led Jonathan Johnson to physically carry his 10-year-old son.“My oldest son woke up and he had pain in his legs and he wasn’t able to walk. He tried to put weight on them and was just right down on the floor,” Johnson said.Johnson took him to the hospital where they learned he had Acute Viral Myositis. A rare condition causing severe calf pain. It usually happens in children during the recovery phase of Influenza B.“That was kind of out of nowhere. He didn’t have a fever anymore, he didn’t have symptoms. We thought we were on the tail end and he was all mended,” Johnson said.Thankfully, his son was okay the next day.According to Dr. Mark Rupp of Nebraska Medicine, while Douglas County is seeing a surge in type B Influenza it’s not uncommon.“It’s about 30% to 40% of cases right now are Type B, it’s not the majority, but it’s a very large and substantial portion of flu that we’re seeing right now,” said Dr. Rupp.Though Acute Viral Myositis can seem scary, just like other Type A and B symptoms you’re likely to recover.“Both typically cause fever and a lot of congestion, headaches, muscle aches. Those symptoms will typically run its course over a period of several days and typically people will get better,” Dr. Rupp said.According to Dr. Rupp, while respiratory virus season is coming to an end it’s still important to get your flu vaccine and get tested if you have symptoms.Copyright 2024 WOWT.

We’re also seeing a good bit of strep, along with lots of kids with asthma flares. Symptoms of strep include sore throathroat pain, red swollen tonsils, fever and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.”Dr. Christopher Loewe -- Ascension St. John Hospital“The biggest thing I’m seeing right now is Influenza. I’m seeing kids and adults with it along with a few severe cases of post-influenza pneumonia in kids. This is a reminder to rest and drink lots of fluids. Also, everyone should wash their hands frequently.”Dr. Jennifer Stephens-Hoyer -- Emergency Department, Henry Ford Medical Center Plymouth“While COVID-19 rates have fallen a bit in the last month, cases are still popping up in the ED. And it seems, from the ED perspective, to be affecting the elderly most harshly. Influenza activity, specifically Influenza A, is at a high level in our area. Vaccination provides some protection, but breakthrough infections do still happen. So being mindful of others when you suspect or know you are ill may help quell spread.”Dr. Glen Clark -- Emergency Center Chief, Corewell Health’s Beaumont Hospital Grosse Pointe“We are seeing gastroenteritis, or the stomach flu, as well other viral illnesses. COVID and influenza cases are still being documented.”OAKLAND COUNTY – Stomach viruses, strep throat, influenza, Covid, RSVSarah Rauner, RN -- Chief nurse practitioner, Emergency Center and After Hours Pediatric Clinic, Corewell Health Beaumont Troy Hospital“We have seen an increase in vomiting, diarrhea, with and without fevers. Strep throat has increased a bit lately. We are still seeing influenza and COVID with less RSV. Hopefully we are in the home stretch of back to back infections for school age children and younger.”Emergency Department, Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital“We have had a lot of fever, respiratory issues and pain – mostly abdominal but chest pain as well. We had one case of measles on the weekend seen here in the ED.”Washtenaw County – Influenza, viral illnesses, Covid, spring allergies, asthma & COPD flare-upsDr. Brad Uren -- Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine“Less COVID and URIs generally this week. Not as much allergy/asthma/COPD this week.”Dr. Marisa Louie -- Medical Director of Children’s Emergency Services, Michigan Medicine“We are seeing a lot of influenza still, in addition to the usual mix of other viruses.”Washtenaw County Health Department“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents are currently at high levels. Most Influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw County are Influenza A, types A(H1N1) and A(H3). Sporadic cases of Influenza B are being reported. Influenza-related deaths in Washtenaw County adults have been reported this flu season. All individuals were older adults with confirmed Influenza A infection. Flu-related hospitalizations of Washtenaw residents are currently at high levels.”Monroe County – Respiratory illnesses, influenza, pneumonia, strep throat, stomach virusesProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital – Emergency Center“This week at ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital we are seeing a lot of respiratory illnesses, including influenza A and B, pneumonia, and strep throat.

Among the 63 cases in wild birds, 44 were found in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, and the rest in seven other states. Two of the cases tested positive for the H5N5 virus serotype, and the rest for the H5N1 variant.FLI’s risk assessment also takes into account the six million poultry that have been lost to the disease across Europe since last autumn/fall. Furthermore, infections have been confirmed in a number of wild bird species. Particularly affected have been waterfowl near the North Sea and the Baltic Sea.As a result, FLI considers that there is still a high risk of HPAI virus transmission from infected wild birds to the country’s poultry and captive birds.Since the start of March, the FLI has recorded just two HPAI infections in avian species in Germany, both of which were in wild birds of prey. Further HPAI cases in wild birdsAs of March 8, 25 European states have registered one or more cases of HPAI in wild birds — a total of 325 outbreaks. This is according to the latest edition of the Animal Disease Information System. Published by the European Commission (EC), it monitors the animal disease situation in European Union (EU) member states and adjacent countries.Compared with the previous update dated March 1, this is an increase of 11 outbreaks, and Northern Ireland appears to have confirmed its first outbreak of 2024 in the first week of this month.Totals for Denmark and Poland had each risen by three over the week, Sweden’s by two, and Romania’s and Slovenia’s each by one. For the year to date, 104 outbreaks in wild birds have been reported in Germany, 62 in Denmark, 21 in Sweden, and 19 in Romania. Additional information on outbreaks is given in official notifications from the national animal health agencies to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).Among these registered over the past week are a total of four wild birds that have tested positive for the H5N1 HPAI virus serotype in three German states. The great majority of HPAI cases among European wild birds since the start of the winter season have been linked to the H5N1 variant.In the United Kingdom (U.K.), an HPAI infection has been confirmed in a bird of prey. Found dead in the East Lothian region in the southeast of Scotland, the bird tested positive for the H5N5 HPAI virus variant earlier this month. 2 outbreaks reported in European poultry flocks Total outbreaks in the region’s commercial flocks stands at 131 for the year so far, according to the EC’s latest System update (dated March 8).Up to that point, 15 countries in the region had reported one or more outbreaks in 2024. Romania registered its first cases in this category in the first week of March, increasing the EC’s regional total by one.The highest total so far this year is from Moldova with 55, followed by Poland (24), and Germany (nine).Meanwhile, the authority in Bulgaria has notified WOAH about one more HPAI outbreak on a commercial farm.Starting on March 12, cases were observed among around 12,600 poultry at a premises in Pazardzhik. This was the first detection of the H5N1 HPAI virus in this southern province in 2024, and it brings the nation’s total outbreaks since the start of the year to nine. According to the notification, presence of the H5N1 virus serotype was confirmed, and the flock was depopulated. In a separate category of “captive birds,” the EC System records HPAI outbreaks in non-commercial poultry, zoos, and similar premises.As of March 8, the total for the category stands at 45. With a total of 22, the Czech Republic has registered the most outbreaks of this type since the start of 2024, followed by Germany (eight), and Ukraine (seven). The situation is unchanged from that published seven days earlier. Norway reports another case in wild foxTo WOAH the Norwegian animal health agency has confirmed another HPAI infection in a second wild animal.In the last week of February, a red fox tested positive for an H5 virus in the Troms and Finnmark region. It appears to have been found around one kilometer away from and five days after the previous case, also a red fox. Both animals were euthanized.There is no clear evidence of direct mammal-to-mammal transmission of avian influenza viruses, according to a recent report published by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The authors state that this is despite a growing number of reported cases, particularly in wild carnivores.While the reasons for this increase are not fully understood, EFSA states that contact between infected wild birds and carnivores likely occurs frequently. As a result, it recommends close surveillance of the viruses in circulation, so that any strains showing signs of enhanced transmission to mammals are identified as soon as possible.

Photo: CanvaThrough comprehensive analyses of epidemiological, genetic and bird migration data, scientists have found that the dominant genotype replacement of the H5N8 viruses in 2020 contributed to the H5N1 outbreak in the 2021/22 wave.The avian influenza outbreak killed millions of birds across 5 of the 7 continents in 2022. In the first 6 months of that year, more than 69 million farmed birds were culled and 34,000 wild birds died from the virus, though this is likely to be underestimated.The scientists found that the 2020 outbreak of the H5N8 genotype instead of the G0 genotype produced reassortment opportunities and led to the emergence of a new H5N1 virus with G1’s HA and MP genes, causing a significant outbreak in Europe and North America. And through the wild bird migration flyways investigation, the Chinese researchers found that the temporal-spatial coincidence between the H5N8 G1 virus and the bird autumn migration may have expanded the H5 viral spread, which may be one of the main drivers of the emergence of the 2020-22 H5 panzootic.In the paper ‘Spatiotemporal genotype replacement of H5N8 avian influenza viruses contributed to H5N1 emergence in 2021/2022 panzootic’, published in the journal Journal of Virology, the authors say that since 2020, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 subtype variants of clade 2.3.4.4b have spread across continents, but until now the factors promoting the genesis and spread of the H5 HPAI viruses have been unclear.To read more articles, news and updates on the global AVIAN INFLUENZA situation, click here.But in this research, the scientists found that the spatiotemporal genotype replacement of H5N8 HPAI viruses contributed to the emergence of the H5N1 variant that caused the 2021/23 panzootic. They found that the viral evolution in poultry of Egypt and surrounding area and autumn bird migration from the Russia-Kazakhstan region to Europe are important drivers. These findings, they say, provide important targets for early warning and could help control the current and future HPAI epidemics.Bird flu spread 3 times fasterThe publication Nature Asia reported that a team of international researchers revealed that the virus mutated to spread 3 times faster among wild birds than it did in farmed poultry in 2020 and has caused a significant rise in incidental infections in wild carnivores, mink and marine animals.Rabeh Al-Shishini, virologist at Egypt’s National Research Centre, said Egypt began vaccinating poultry with vaccines around 2005/6 against an avian influenza subvariant, but it became endemic in Egypt until 2017, when poultry and wild birds were infected with another bird flu subvariant (H5N8) that caused global spikes in 2020/1.“The 2016 and 2017 outbreak in Egypt is attributable to multiple reasons, including the absence of effective vaccines against the prevailing bird flu variants,” said the virologist. The newest H5N1 strains has evolved from, and almost entirely replaced, the H5N8 strain that emerged in Egypt in 2016.Join 31,000+ subscribers Subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated about all the need-to-know content in the poultry sector, three times a week.

The affected areas are Punta Espinoza on Fernandina Island and Bahía Urbina on Isabela Island. PDF FILE Recently, authorities in the Galapagos Islands have temporarily closed two sites due to a potential avian influenza outbreak. The affected areas are Punta Espinoza on Fernandina Island and Bahía Urbina on Isabela Island. The decision to close these sites came after park rangers discovered a dozen dead seabirds, specifically Galapagos shearwaters (Puffinus subalaris). The cause of their deaths is suspected to be avian influenza, although laboratory test results are still pending. Since September 2023, nearly 200 birds have been affected across the entire archipelago, with San Cristóbal Island also experiencing closures in two areas for the past six months. The Galápagos Islands, renowned for their unique biodiversity and pristine ecosystems, are closely monitored by conservationists and authorities. The closure of these sites aims to prevent further spread of the disease and protect the delicate balance of this extraordinary natural habitat. Significance of birds in the Galapagos Islands: The Galapagos Islands, an Ecuadorian archipelago, harbor unique bird species that have evolved distinct qualities setting them apart from their counterparts elsewhere in the world. Tourists visiting the national park typically encounter around nineteen different bird species among the Galapagos avifauna. Scientists estimate that approximately 750,000 seabirds inhabit this region, making it a vital habitat for avian life. Marine birds dominate the Galapagos due to the abundant oxygen-rich waters and natural behaviors. Notable species include: Blue-footed Boobies: These charismatic birds, with their striking blue feet, constitute thirty percent of the global population. Red-footed Boobies: The world’s largest red-footed booby colony resides here. Nazca Boobies: Galapagos hosts the planet’s most extensive Nazca booby community. Flightless Cormorants: These unique cormorants are well-adapted to their environment. Galapagos Penguins: The only penguins found north of the equator thrive here. In contrast, few terrestrial bird species inhabit the islands—approximately 22 to 23 permanent species. Among them are the iconic Galapagos finches, which played a crucial role in Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. These remarkable birds contribute to the archipelago’s ecological balance and serve as living examples of adaptation and natural selection.Continue after advertising. As scientists continue their investigations, the Galapagos National Park Directorate remains vigilant, emphasizing the need for swift action to safeguard the islands’ iconic wildlife. Avian influenza outbreaks can have devastating consequences for bird populations, making timely measures crucial to preserving the Galapagos’ ecological integrity. While the exact cause of the outbreak remains under scrutiny, the closure of these areas underscores the commitment to conservation and the delicate dance between human activity and the fragile ecosystems that define the Galapagos Islands. In summary, the potential avian influenza outbreak has prompted the temporary closure of Punta Espinoza and Bahía Urbina, signaling the urgent need for vigilance, and coordinated efforts to protect this UNESCO World Heritage Site.

A year after high egg prices dominated headlines and everyday conversations, cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) are impacting the market during a traditionally strong selling season.According to the U.S. Department of Agricultureâs latest livestock, dairy and poultry market report, new outbreaks of HPAI have surfaced in California, affecting supplies. The USDA also adjusted overall egg production down for the first quarter of 2024 due to lower inventories and described the current HPAI detection situation as one of âsporadic outbreaks.âIndustry analyst Matt Pavich, senior director of strategy and innovation for Revionics, an Aptos company, put the higher prices in context with governmentâs latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. âLooking at grocery, the grocery CPI was 0.0%. If you were to remove eggs from that, inflation is actually going down,â he told Progressive Grocer in a recent interview. To his point, the CPI data shows that the egg prices went up 5.8% in February from the previous month, following a 3.4% increase from December to January. Other commodities, including dairy and chicken, posted declines last month. While current egg prices are off their peak from early 2023, the uptick may not be a short-term blip. âIâm not an epidemiologist, but it does appear to be a particularly nefarious strain in how itâs affecting supply and pricing. I feel there will continue to be an issue in the supply chain with eggs,â Pavich noted.Thankfully, he added, acute shortages donât seem to be a problem for now. The main concern is price ahead of the egg-centric holiday of Easter. âYou have this convergence with peak egg season,â Pavich said, adding, âRetailers are trying to strike that balance. As we are getting closer to Easter, they need to be competitive on eggs and meats, like ham.âBecause there are different pricing levels based on egg types, ranging from traditional commodity eggs to higher-end pasture-raised eggs and cage-free eggs, grocers do have options for promotions and pricing. âThey can start with lower priced eggs or try to shift people from one type to other,â Pavich remarked.On a broader level, Pavich said that any hike in price will be noticed by consumers battered by inflation over the last few years. âMost studies show that it takes about 18 months for consumers to realize that inflation has died down. The economy looks good, inflation is good, but consumers are saying that prices are not,â he added.

The vaccine, the company's self-developed cell-cultured influenza vaccine, contains the recommended composition of influenza virus for use in the 2024 Southern Hemisphere influenza season announced by the World Health Organization (WHO). Starting with the export to Thailand, SK bioscience expects to extend its sales not only in the Southeast Asian market but also in the Southern Hemisphere market. Thailand is affected by both the WHO's Northern and Southern Hemisphere flu vaccination guidelines due to its elongated geography from north to south. Recently, Thailand Department of Disease Control has launched a vaccination campaign aimed at workers in 31 major tourist areas in efforts to prevent influenza after the COVID-19 pandemic. SKYCellflu is the world's first cell culture-based influenza vaccine to obtain WHO Pre-qualification (PQ) certification. Last year, the company resumed production of SKYCellflu and secured first place in the national immunisation programme bid for the 2023-24 season after a three-year hiatus due to the production of the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic. SK bioscience intends to expand its global market through procurement contacts with international organizations such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). SKYCellflu has already received marketing authorisations in 12 countries globally, including Malaysia, Singapore, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Chile. It is currently or will soon be approved in ten more countries, clearing the path for a full-fledged expansion of the export market.

Factors such as vaccine fatigue and misinformation—which began circulating during the COVID-19 pandemic and has persisted—have eroded trust in vaccination, making some individuals hesitant to roll up their sleeves. Some who had previously relied on vaccine regimens began to question their value, increasing skepticism and causing a dip in vaccine uptake.Amid these challenges, 2024 offers hope: Pharmaceutical research and development teams are pioneering new vaccines that leverage messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, expand protection to vulnerable populations, and streamline the vaccination process—efforts that may help mend ongoing divides. Here is a look at some of the most anticipated vaccine developments in 2024.READ MORE: Immunization Resource CenterReferences1. The power of mRNA. Moderna.

As production is planned based on demand and flu vaccines take several months to produce, it is crucial that vaccine orders are completed by the end of March this year. The number of vaccine doses that have been pre-ordered so far deviate significantly from estimated demand, which could potentially lead to restrictions on vaccine availability. This is the case for both standard and, in particular, high-dose vaccines. The Paul-Ehrlich-Institut therefore reminds all doctors and pharmacists to place their orders before 31 March, 2024, in order to ensure an adequate supply of flu vaccines for the coming season. It is important that every person in Germany who wants to get vaccinated is given the opportunity to do so. Due to the complex and lengthy flu vaccine manufacturing process, a sufficient supply for the population can only be guaranteed if enough vaccines are pre-ordered in a timely manner. The vaccination recommendations of the Standing Committee on Vaccination (Ständige Impfkommission, STIKO) help provide guidance for pre-ordering flu vaccines. The age and individual risks for persons receiving a vaccine are included in the STIKO recommendations. These recommendations have been reaffirmed by the Federal Joint Committee (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, G-BA), which lays out the details of the reimbursement obligations of statutory health insurance providers (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung, GKV) in the Preventive Vaccination Directive. According to the recommendations, people over the age of 60 should again receive a flu shot with a high-dose vaccine during the 2024/2025 flu season. The production timeline works as follows: after orders are completed by the end of March, vaccine production begins. The process takes about four to five months, and then the master adjustment is submitted for approval. After successful batch testing and approval by the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, the gradual delivery of vaccine batches begins in mid-August. Reorders cannot be accommodated due to the lengthy manufacturing process. It should be noted that no additional quotas will be available for latecomers due to global demand. The Paul-Ehrlich-Institut therefore asks you to place your orders according to your expected needs by 31 March, 2024, at the latest in order to ensure a secure supply of flu vaccines in Germany for the 2024/2025 influenza season.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The assertion from Queensland’s chief health officer John Gerrard that it’s time to stop using the term “long COVID” has made waves in Australian and international media over recent days. Gerrard’s comments were related to new research from his team finding long-term symptoms of COVID are similar to the ongoing symptoms following other viral infections. But there are limitations in this research, and problems with Gerrard’s argument we should drop the term “long COVID”. Here’s why. A bit about the research The study involved texting a survey to 5,112 Queensland adults who had experienced respiratory symptoms and had sought a PCR test in 2022. Respondents were contacted 12 months after the PCR test. Some had tested positive to COVID, while others had tested positive to influenza or had not tested positive to either disease. Survey respondents were asked if they had experienced ongoing symptoms or any functional impairment over the previous year. The study found people with respiratory symptoms can suffer long-term symptoms and impairment, regardless of whether they had COVID, influenza or another respiratory disease. These symptoms are often referred to as “post-viral”, as they linger after a viral infection. Gerrard’s research will be presented in April at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. It hasn’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal. Read more: I have COVID. How likely am I to get long COVID? After the research was publicised last Friday, some experts highlighted flaws in the study design. For example, Steven Faux, a long COVID clinician interviewed on ABC’s television news, said the study excluded people who were hospitalised with COVID (therefore leaving out people who had the most severe symptoms). He also noted differing levels of vaccination against COVID and influenza may have influenced the findings. In addition, Faux pointed out the survey would have excluded many older people who may not use smartphones. The authors of the research have acknowledged some of these and other limitations in their study. Ditching the term ‘long COVID’ Based on the research findings, Gerrard said in a press release: We believe it is time to stop using terms like ‘long COVID’. They wrongly imply there is something unique and exceptional about longer term symptoms associated with this virus. This terminology can cause unnecessary fear, and in some cases, hypervigilance to longer symptoms that can impede recovery. But Gerrard and his team’s findings cannot substantiate these assertions. Their survey only documented symptoms and impairment after respiratory infections. It didn’t ask people how fearful they were, or whether a term such as long COVID made them especially vigilant, for example. Tens of thousands of Australians, and millions of people worldwide, have long COVID. New Africa/Shutterstock In discussing Gerrard’s conclusions about the terminology, Faux noted that even if only 3% of people develop long COVID (the survey found 3% of people had functional limitations after a year), this would equate to some 150,000 Queenslanders with the condition. He said: To suggest that by not calling it long COVID you would be […] somehow helping those people not to focus on their symptoms is a curious conclusion from that study. Another clinician and researcher, Philip Britton, criticised Gerrard’s conclusion about the language as “overstated and potentially unhelpful”. He noted the term “long COVID” is recognised by the World Health Organization as a valid description of the condition. A cruel irony An ever-growing body of research continues to show how COVID can cause harm to the body across organ systems and cells. We know from the experiences shared by people with long COVID that the condition can be highly disabling, preventing them from engaging in study or paid work. It can also harm relationships with their friends, family members, and even their partners. Despite all this, people with long COVID have often felt gaslit and unheard. When seeking treatment from health-care professionals, many people with long COVID report they have been dismissed or turned away. Read more: Social media, activism, trucker caps: the fascinating story behind long COVID Last Friday – the day Gerrard’s comments were made public – was actually International Long COVID Awareness Day, organised by activists to draw attention to the condition. The response from people with long COVID was immediate. They shared their anger on social media about Gerrard’s comments, especially their timing, on a day designed to generate greater recognition for their illness. Since the start of the COVID pandemic, patient communities have fought for recognition of the long-term symptoms many people faced. The term “long COVID” was in fact coined by people suffering persistent symptoms after a COVID infection, who were seeking words to describe what they were going through. The role people with long COVID have played in defining their condition and bringing medical and public attention to it demonstrates the possibilities of patient-led expertise. For decades, people with invisible or “silent” conditions such as ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) have had to fight ignorance from health-care professionals and stigma from others in their lives. They have often been told their disabling symptoms are psychosomatic. Gerrard’s comments, and the media’s amplification of them, repudiates the term “long COVID” that community members have chosen to give their condition an identity and support each other. This is likely to cause distress and exacerbate feelings of abandonment. Terminology matters The words we use to describe illnesses and conditions are incredibly powerful. Naming a new condition is a step towards better recognition of people’s suffering, and hopefully, better diagnosis, health care, treatment and acceptance by others. The term “long COVID” provides an easily understandable label to convey patients’ experiences to others. It is well known to the public. It has been routinely used in news media reporting and and in many reputable medical journal articles. Most importantly, scrapping the label would further marginalise a large group of people with a chronic illness who have often been left to struggle behind closed doors.

Abud,Joseph L. Fink III, JD, DSC (Hon.), BSPHARM, FAPhA Legal issues surfaced once again with the COVID-19 pandemicAlthough many health care facilities implemented policies to mandate vaccinations for health care workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic, hesitancy and mistrust remained a major concern among this important target group.1 HCWs have a clear responsibility to prevent transmission of infections because vaccine-preventable diseases continue to emerge sporadically, such as the current challenges associated with respiratory syncytial virus. COVID-19 raised the question once again: Should vaccine mandates be implemented to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex health care landscape?Image credit: Aron M - Austria | stock.adobe.comA long history of controversy surrounds mandatory immunization policies. An abundance of litigation based on such mandates has arisen in a wide variety of court systems. The leading legal authority recognizing such power for governmental units in the United States was the 1905 decision of the US Supreme Court in Jacobson v Massachusetts.2 In that case, the state had adopted a statute empowering cities and towns to enforce mandatory, free immunizations for adults older than 21 years. In 1902, there had been a smallpox outbreak, and the Cambridge Board of Health in Massachusetts ordered the vaccination or revaccination of all adults. A religious leader challenged that requirement, arguing that subjecting him to fines or imprisonment for nonadherence was an invasion of his liberty. The nation’s highest court did not agree with his arguments.2About the AuthorsAli S. Abud is a biology major at Western University in London, Ontario, Canada.Joseph L. Fink III, JD, DSc (Hon), BSPharm, FAPhA, is emeritus professor of pharmacy law and policy as well as former Kentucky Pharmacists Association Professor of Leadership at the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy in Lexington.Fast-forward more than a century to the current day, when the US Supreme Court declined to hear employees’ challenges of immunization mandates. In these cases, employees challenging the mandates ranged from nurses in New Jersey to federal employees and members of the military.3-5Public health officials cite patient safety as a core responsibility, whereas those in opposition continue to advocate for worker autonomy. Clearly, the ethical obligations of HCWs to do no harm must be carefully balanced with workers’ rights.6Voluntary efforts to increase vaccination rates and stop the spread of contagious diseases have traditionally had mixed results.7 Seasonal influenza, which causes more than 290,000 deaths annually,8 has a Healthy People 2030 vaccination target goal of 90% among health care personnel, a figure that greatly exceeds the 70.2% immunization rate from survey respondents in an ambulatory-based study.9 It is estimated that roughly 60% of US HCWs support mandatory influenza vaccination policies. Still, opinions vary among different continents and demographics.10 In exploring possible alternatives to mandatory vaccination, one study implemented several interventions, including emailing staff informational pieces on the benefits of vaccines, improving vaccine accessibility within the health care facility, and increasing communication by providing influenza surveillance reports to employees. Through repeated emphasis on these measures, results from postintervention surveys revealed that the 90% vaccination rate among HCWs can be achieved without a formal vaccination mandate.9Pharmacists can serve as educators and advocates and help dismantle barriers to receiving vaccines. Aside from addressing vaccine hesitancy, pharmacists can act as immunizers, when applicable, which has been shown to have a significant impact on vaccination rates.11As one of the most cost-effective forms of health care intervention,12 vaccines play a vital role in contributing to the health and well-being of modern society. Mandatory immunization for HCWs, however, is a complex issue that requires considering both the benefits and ethical dilemmas of such a mandate. Policy makers should work closely with frontline workers to determine the best course of action that prioritizes patient safety while respecting worker autonomy.ReferencesMaltezou HC, Theodoridou K, Ledda C, Rapisarda V, Theodoridou M.

From: Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, The Scottish Government and Welsh Government Published 19 March 2024 Last updated 19 March 2024 — See all updates This was published under the 2022 to 2024 Sunak Conservative government New measures to better protect the poultry sector from future avian influenza outbreaks have been set out by the government today (19 March). Under the changes announced there will be new requirements for all bird keepers - regardless of the size of their flock - to officially register their birds. Currently only those who keep 50 or more poultry must do so, limiting the effectiveness of our national disease control measures. By registering their birds, keepers will ensure they receive important updates relevant to them, such as on any local avian disease outbreaks and information on biosecurity rules to help protect their flocks. This will help to manage potential disease outbreaks, such as avian influenza and Newcastle disease, and limit any spread. The information on the register will also be used to identify all bird keepers in disease control zones, allowing for more effective surveillance, so that zones can be lifted at the earliest possible opportunity and trade can resume more quickly following an outbreak of avian disease in Great Britain. The changes come following the UK’s worst ever outbreak of avian influenza, with more than 360 cases across Great Britain since late October 2021, including in a significant number of backyard flocks. Christine Middlemiss, UK Chief Veterinary Officer said: “These new rules will enable us to have a full picture of the number and location of birds kept across Great Britain, making it easier to track and manage the spread of avian disease. “This information will be vital in helping to inform future risk assessments and maintain our commitment to continually building our extensive avian influenza research portfolio.” Sheila Voas, CVO Scotland said: “These changes to bird registration are a necessary step to help protect the health of kept birds and the general public from future avian disease risks.” “We have faced challenges during previous outbreaks in clearly communicating the changes in both risk and mandatory biosecurity requirements to bird keepers, particularly smallholders and backyard keepers. This approach will enable us all to be better prepared and protected against a future pandemic.” Richard Irvine, CVO Wales said: “The new registration requirements will make it easier for bird keepers and government to work together to track and control the spread of notifiable avian diseases in Wales. APHA will also be able to contact bird keepers if there’s a notifiable disease outbreak in their area, for example bird flu, which in turn will help prevent the spread of disease and protect flocks. “It is important to remember that scrupulous hygiene and biosecurity remain essential to protect flocks from the threat of disease. “Bird keepers have worked hard to protect their birds from the risks of avian influenza and I want to thank them for their continued efforts.” Richard Griffiths, BPC Chief Executive, said: “New registration requirements are a good step towards supporting birdkeepers and Government to collaborate seamlessly to combat disease spread. Timely communication ensures all birdkeepers receive important updates and stay informed, amplifying efforts to work together to track and control the spread of avian influenza. Alongside stringent biosecurity measures, registration is another tool in the toolbox to safeguard bird health.” This proposal follows a 2023 GB consultation and takes forward the recommendation from the 2018 Dame Glenys Stacey Review and lessons identified from the 2021/2022 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreak and previous HPAI outbreaks. This change to bird registration is required in order to protect the health of all poultry and other captive birds in GB and also public health. Bird keepers will need to provide information, including their contact details, the location where birds are kept and details of the birds (species, number and what they are kept for). In England and Wales keepers are encouraged to register their birds ahead of the legal deadline on 1 October 2024. In Scotland, keepers should register from 1 September 2024 when there will be a new Scottish Kept Bird Register in place. The new rules cover owners of backyard flocks, birds of prey and pigeon fanciers, but do not affect caged pet birds (excluding any poultry species) kept entirely inside a domestic dwelling, such as a parrot, canary or budgie, which never leaves the property other than to visit a vet or another short-term period. The requirements will be set out in legislation shortly and keepers will also be legally required to update their information on an annual basis. Further information on the registration of birds can be found on GOV.UK, gov.scot and gov.wales.
