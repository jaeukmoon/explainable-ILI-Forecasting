This news article discusses a study that compared the innate immune responses in the lungs of mice colonized with Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and non-colonized mice after influenza A virus (IAV) infection. The study found that both colonized and non-colonized mice showed a local inflammatory response, characterized by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and an influx of inflammatory monocytes into the lungs, at the asymptomatic stage of viral infection. However, the severity of co-infection was not automatically severe in the colonized mice. This study provides insights into the immune responses during influenza and bacterial co-infections.
