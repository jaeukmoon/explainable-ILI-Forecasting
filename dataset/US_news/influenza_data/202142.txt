Here, we aimed to compare innate immune responses in the lungs of healthy colonized and non-colonized mice after IAV challenge at the initial asymptomatic stage of infection. Responses during a severe bacterial pneumonia were profiled for comparison. Cytokine and innate immune cell imprints of the lungs were analyzed. Irrespective of the colonization status, mild H1N1 IAV infection was characterized by a bi-phasic disease progression resulting in full recovery of the animals. Already at the asymptomatic stage of viral infection, the pro-inflammatory cytokine response was as high as in pneumococcal pneumonia. Flow cytometry analyses revealed an early influx of inflammatory monocytes into the lungs. Neutrophil influx was mostly limited to bacterial infections. The majority of cells, except monocytes, displayed an activated phenotype characterized by elevated CCR2 and MHCII expression. In conclusion, we show that IAV challenge of colonized healthy mice does not automatically result in severe co-infection. However, a general local inflammatory response was noted at the asymptomatic stage of infection irrespective of the infection type.

The annual incidence ranges from five to eleven cases per 1000 in human populations in Europe and North America1. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) remains the most commonly identified cause of CAP2. During seasonal influenza outbreaks, the circulating influenza A virus (IAV) becomes the major cause of CAP3. Several studies showed that IAV infections predispose the host to bacterial dissemination from the upper to the lower respiratory tract (URT, LRT)4,5,6. However, most clinical investigations linked severe co-infections to individuals with comorbidities, elderly people, pregnant women, and children under the age of one. In contrast, the majority of healthy individuals recover from such severe infections7.The innate immune system is of crucial importance in limiting viral spread as well as combatting the onset of subsequent bacterial infection of the lungs3. At early stages of infection, resident professional phagocytes and recruited neutrophils and monocytes are the first responders. Alveolar (AMs) and interstitial macrophages (IMs) reside within the lungs8. AMs are mainly involved in pathogen sensing and rapid recruitment of leukocytes9. IMs are less abundant and exhibit reduced phagocytic potential. Several studies have shown that IAV infection leads to a depletion of AMs, resulting in pneumococcal overgrowth, severe tissue pathology, and fatal outcome10,11. However, it was also demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-1 signaling prevents AM depletion and therefore, AMs are critically involved in host resistance to co-infections12. In contrast, the role of IMs is not clear yet. Dendritic cells [DCs; conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs)] respond rapidly to an infection13 by producing type I interferons (IFNs)14,15. Only a few studies analyzed the role of DCs in IAV and pneumococcal co-infections. While one study showed that IAV infection results in reduced cDC counts in lungs and, consequently, predisposes mice to a severe co-infection16, another study demonstrated elevated levels of lung DCs post IAV challenge and a potentially protective effect17.Neutrophils and monocytes are also rapidly recruited to the site of infection18,19. In the hyper-inflammatory environment, recruited monocytes can differentiate to DCs/macrophages or directly phagocytose pathogens. A sustained increase of pro-inflammatory monocytes was found in IAV-infected patients20. A pivotal role of both recruited cell types in pneumococcal and IAV co-infections was suggested. Pneumococcal carriage was associated with a quick influx of neutrophils and a subsequent recruitment of monocytes, while challenge of colonized individuals with live-attenuated IAV impaired these immune responses21.The murine studies provided valuable insights into innate immune responses during bacterial and viral co-infections. However, they also have limitations. In most cases the chosen order of infection, first IAV followed by pneumococci, might not reflect a natural sequence of co-infections. Furthermore, most studies focus on one immune cell type during a severe phase of infection. Here, we characterized the innate immune cell imprint of the lungs in response to natural co-infections. We show that pneumococci asymptomatically persist in the nasopharyngeal cavity of mice. IAV infection of colonized mice results in trafficking of the bacteria to the lungs in 50% of cases. However, the animals recover after a bi-phasic course of disease. The early asymptomatic state of infections was characterized by elevated cytokine levels irrespective of the infection type. Analyses of the innate immune cell composition showed infection-driven imprint with no differences between colonized and non-colonized mice after viral challenge. However, already at the asymptomatic stage, the inflammatory response was as high as in severe bacterial pneumonia.ResultsIntracellular killing of pneumococci by professional phagocytes is not affected by IAV infectionIn the lungs, resident and recruited immune cells are first challenged with IAV prior to subsequent bacterial exposure. To mimic this order of infection, professional phagocytes were challenged with pathogens in this particular order. To investigate if IAV infection affects the ability of professional phagocytes to kill pneumococci, susceptibility of human primary monocytes and macrophages to H1N1 was analyzed (Fig. S1A). Based on these results, a MOI of 0.1 was used for subsequent co-infection experiments. All three cell types were infected with colonizing pneumococcal strain 19F. Irrespective of prior H1N1 infection, intracellular bacteria were eliminated by phagocytes. No differences in bacterial killing between mono- and co-infected cells were observed (Fig. S1B–D). In addition, pathogen eliminating properties of mouse monocytes/macrophages were tested. First, IAV replication was confirmed in J774 cells (Fig. S1E). Analyses of pneumococcal killing in single and co-infected J774 cells mirrored the human phenotype. However, a 19 h delay in bacterial elimination was noted (Fig. S1F). These results suggested that IAV infection does not impair the general killing function of these cell types.Streptococcus pneumoniae 19F colonizes C57BL/6J miceTo mimic natural co-infection, it was of crucial importance to use a pneumococcal strain, which is able to colonize mice. Invasive pneumococcal strains (e.g., TIGR4) either cause acute severe infections or are cleared if low initial inoculum is used22. Therefore, colonizing properties of S. pneumoniae 19F strain, a serotype, which is typically associated with human colonization, were assessed. Colonization was defined as stable bacterial load in the URT and absence of local and systemic inflammation. Initial colonization was characterized by a weight drop and a mild increase in clinical score on day one post bacterial application. Both parameters normalized over the next three days (Fig. 1A,B). S. pneumoniae 19F stably colonized mice for seven consecutive days with no detectable bacteria in the lungs on day seven (Fig. 1C,D). To exclude a sustained local or systemic inflammatory response, protein and chemokine concentrations as well as white blood cell differential (WBC) were determined (Fig. 1E–I). The initial increase in local and systemic inflammation normalized within three days post colonization.Figure 1C57BL/6J mice are susceptible to S. pneumoniae 19F colonization. Female C57BL/6J mice were intranasally colonized with 1 × 107 CFU of S. pneumoniae 19F (19F_C) or challenged with PBS and monitored over seven consecutive days.

To induce only mild symptoms, mice were infected with a non-mouse adapted H1N123 and disease progression was monitored (Fig. 2). Dose-dependent weight loss and increase in clinical score was noted (Fig. 2A,B). On day four, the presence of viral RNA in lungs was confirmed (Fig. 2C). WBC showed elevated levels of neutrophils in circulation (Fig. 2D). Based on these results, 1 × 105 PFU were used for all H1N1 infections.Figure 2C57BL/6J mice are susceptible to non-mouse adapted H1N1 IAV. C57BL/6J were intranasally inoculated with indicated PFUs of H1N1 or challenged with PBS and monitored over 4 consecutive days. (A) Weight and (B) clinical score were determined daily. Horizontal dotted lines in A and B indicate termination conditions (20% weight loss and/or clinical score of 20) of the experiment. (C) On day 4, lungs were extracted and viral infection was confirmed via IAV NP-specific qRT-PCR (dashed line indicates detection limit). (D) WBC limited to neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were determined at day 4. One experiment with four mice per group (total: n = 4) was performed (A–D). In general, mean values ± SD are displayed (A, B). Each dot represents one mouse and horizontal lines display mean values (C). The data in (D) are displayed as box plots.

In (D), Mann Whitney U-test was performed (*p < 0.05).Full size imageLocal and systemic inflammatory responses at the early onset of pneumoniaNext, a mild H1N1 infection was induced seven days after bacterial colonization (referred to as co-infection). Single H1N1 infection served as a control. To track severe responses, a high dosage group of pneumococcus infection was included (Fig. 3A). In contrast to severe pneumococcal pneumonia, H1N1 infections of colonized and non-colonized mice were characterized by a bi-phasic course of disease resulting in full recovery (Fig. 3B,C). Analyses of bacterial burden in nasal washes (NAL) and bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) showed that pneumococci remained restricted to the nasopharynx in colonized mice, whereas pneumococcal pneumonia was characterized by a high bacterial burden, and 50% of co-infected mice had bacteria in the lungs (Fig. 3D,E). Although local (Fig. 3F) and systemic (Fig. 3G) inflammatory responses were noted in all three infections, no significant differences between the groups were detected.Figure 3Mild H1N1 infection of S. pneumoniae 19F colonized mice does not result in severe co-infection. (A) Female C57BL/6J mice were intranasally colonized with S. pneumoniae 19F (1 × 107 CFU) for seven days followed by a subsequent mild H1N1 infection (1 × 105 PFU; Co-Inf.). PBS challenged (PBS), only colonized (19F_C), and only H1N1 infected (H1N1) mice served as controls. In addition, severe pneumococcal pneumonia was induced via intranasal inoculation of S. pneumoniae 19F (1 × 108 CFU; 19F_P; day 8). (B) Weight and (C) clinical score were monitored over a period of 16 consecutive days. Horizontal dotted lines in B and C indicate termination conditions (20% weight loss and/or clinical score of 20) of the experiment. (D) CFU counts in nasal washes (NAL) and (E) in BALF, (F) protein concentration of the BALF and (G) WBC were determined after the animals were sacrificed. Horizontal dotted lines in (D) and (E) indicate the limit of detection. Animals were sacrificed at day 16 except for the pneumonia group which was sacrificed at day ten. Two independent experiments with four to six mice per group (total: n ≥ 8) were performed. In general, mean values ± SD are displayed (B, C). Each dot represents one mouse and horizontal lines display mean values (D–F). The data in (G) are displayed as box plots. The level of significance between the PBS and all other groups was determined using Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).Full size imageBased on these results, we hypothesized that an early inflammatory response might rescue healthy mice from severe disease progression in viral and co-infections. All animals were sacrificed before the onset of clinical signs two days post viral infection (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S2). Although no visible signs of illness were noted in both H1N1-infected groups, 50% of co-infected mice had bacteria in the lungs and exhibited elevated systemic responses (Supplementary Fig. S2). Furthermore, elevated influx of leukocytes was noted in lungs of co-infected mice and particularly in bacterial pneumonia group (Supplementary Fig. S2). Next, cytokines were measured in lungs and plasma. Bacterial pneumonia resulted in elevated cytokine levels in both (Fig. 4). Only background levels of IL-10 and IL-12p70 were seen in all infected animals (Supplementary Fig. S3). Although both virus-infected groups were asymptomatic, almost equally high cytokine levels were detected locally and systemically as compared to single bacterial pneumonia, with the exception of IL-1α. Both viral infections had similar IL-1α levels. However, IL-1α was only elevated in the lungs (Fig. 4). In contrast, GM-CSF was detected in plasma of all infected mice and exclusively in lungs of the pneumococcal pneumonia group (Supplementary Fig. S3).Figure 4Local and systemic cytokine production in response to mono- and co-infections. (A) Scheme displaying the time line of different mice infections. Mice were sacrificed at day 9 and (B) CCL2/MCP-1, (C) IL-1α, (D) IL-1β, and (E) IL-6 levels were determined in lungs and plasma. Two independent experiments with six mice per group (total: n = 12) were performed. The data are displayed as box plots. The level of significance between the PBS and all other groups was determined using Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).Full size imageMyeloid cell composition and their phenotype in the lungs in response to different infectionsAlthough single virus and co-infected animals were clinically asymptomatic, an inflammatory cytokine response was noted in the lungs. This led us to explore the composition of myeloid cell subsets of the lungs. To distinguish between vascular and alveolar/interstitial lung compartments, mice received intravenous injection of labeled CD45 antibody. Consequently, CD45hi cells were defined as cells from the vascular and CD45lo as cells from the alveolar/interstitial compartment. Cell subsets were further classified as depicted in Supplementary Fig. S4.In general, elevated frequencies of recruited neutrophils and monocytes were seen in both lung compartments of the bacterial pneumonia group (Fig. 5A,B). Neutrophil influx was slightly increased in co-infections (Fig. 5A). In contrast, increased numbers of monocytes were detected in lungs of both viral infections (Fig. 5B). Analyses of monocyte subpopulations showed that the total rise in monocytes could be linked to the influx of inflammatory/classical monocytes, while non-classical monocyte frequencies were reduced in all infections (Fig. 5C). Analyses of the resident macrophages showed that at the early onset of disease, viral infection did not lead to the depletion of AMs and IMs. In contrast, severe bacterial infection resulted in a drastic drop of both cell types (Fig. 5D,E). Based on the current models 8, three subsets of IMs were examined (Supplementary Fig. S4). Irrespective of the infection type, IM2 frequencies decreased. In contrast, IM3 frequencies increased in all bacterial infections (Fig. 5F). Furthermore, elevated frequencies of pDCs were exclusively detected in co-infected mice (Fig. 5G). In contrast, the total cDC population remained unaffected in co-infections. However, single viral and bacterial infections were characterized by reduced numbers of cDCs (Fig. 5H). Analyses of cDCs subpopulations revealed that the frequency of CD11b+ cDCs was increased in all infections, while CD103+ cDCs remained mostly unaffected (Fig. 5I).Figure 5Innate immune cell composition of the lungs in response to mono- and co-infections. The infections were performed as displayed in (A). At day nine post infections, lungs were harvested, digested, and resulting single cell suspensions were analyzed via flow cytometry. CD45lo cells were classified as cells from the alveolar/interstitial compartment and CD45hi cells as cells from the vascular compartment of the lung. Frequencies of (A) neutrophils (PMNs), (B) total monocytes and (C) monocyte subsets, (D) alveolar macrophages (AMs), (E) interstitial macrophages (IMs) and (F) IM subsets, (G) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), (H) conventional DCs (cDCs), and (I) cDC subsets are displayed. Two independent experiments with six mice per group (total: n ≥ 10) were performed. Each dot represents one mice and bars denote median values. The level of significance between the PBS and all other groups was determined using Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).Full size imageRecruitment of innate immune cells to the site of infection is mainly mediated by the detection of CCL2 via CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)24. Furthermore, resident and recruited cells contribute to adaptive immune responses by presenting antigens via MHCII25. Therefore, these two markers of activation were analyzed. Elevated frequencies of MHCII and CCR2 expressing neutrophils, AMs, and CCR2+ IM1 were mostly detected in the lungs of single bacteria and co-infected mice (Fig. 6). However, no significant differences in frequencies of the innate immune cell subsets expressing MHCII and CCR2 were found in the majority of cell populations (Supplementary Fig. S5). To investigate the phenotype in more detail, the level of MHCII and CCR2 expression on all cells were analyzed (Fig. 7). Within the interstitial/alveolar compartment, MHCII and CCR2 levels were elevated on AMs, CD103+ cDCs, and pDCs in all infections. CD11b+ cDC showed an upregulation of both molecules exclusively in co-infections (Fig. 7). While in IM3 both proteins were upregulated in viral infection, the opposite regulation was noted in single bacterial infections. Furthermore, monocytes were characterized by lower levels of both molecules in response to the majority of infections (Fig. 7). Within the vascular compartment, only neutrophils showed elevated levels of MHCII and CCR2 in single bacterial and co-infections (Fig. 7).Figure 6Expansion of MHCII+ and CCR2+ innate immune cells in response to bacterial and viral infections.

It is assumed that IAV paves the way for colonizing bacteria to spread into the lower respiratory tract, resulting in high mortality3. However, most studies use initial viral application followed by bacterial infection. Since up-to one third of humans are asymptomatically colonized with S. pneumoniae27, our model potentially more closely resembles respiratory co-infections in humans. Our study shows that the onset of pneumonia in healthy mice correlates with a homogeneous immunological response. The onset of infection was characterized by elevated cytokine levels in lungs and plasma, and elevated influx of neutrophils and monocytes in lungs. The majority of immune cells displayed an activated phenotype.After initial mild symptoms, pneumococci can asymptomatically colonize mice. Mild H1N1 infection of colonized mice did not result in a severe pneumonia but enabled lung incursion of pneumococci in 50% of cases. A recent study demonstrated that pneumococci have to adapt to the hostile environment of the IAV-infected lungs, which is characterized by hyper-inflammation and capillary leakage with efflux of antioxidants into the alveolar space28. Furthermore, in vivo studies linked the potential of pneumococci to cause severe co-infections to the capsular serotype29. Particularly invasive capsular serotypes cause severe co-infections. However, this phenomenon seems to be rather strain-specific suggesting that other pneumococcal factors are also involved29. Nonetheless, it was also demonstrated that non-invasive strains could cause lethal co-infections11. Of note, all studies mentioned above used (i) mouse-adapted IAV strains, which readily cause severe tissue damage and (ii) did not involve colonization of mice prior to viral application. Furthermore, studies have shown that severe co-infections are particularly linked to individuals with comorbidities, elderly people, pregnant women, and children under the age of one7. Further studies using a co-infection model equivalent to the one established in comorbid or elderly mice are warranted.Most studies on co-infections deal mainly with one immune cell type and to the best of our knowledge; this is the first study which assesses the complexity of such infections by analyzing several phagocytic immune cells. In general only few differences in disease progression and immune cell composition of the lungs were observed between single IAV and co-infected mice. This is most likely due to (i) order of infection (first colonization followed by viral infection), (ii) the time point of the analysis (early asymptomatic vs. late severe phase of the infection), and (iii) the low virulence of the chosen viral strain. Nevertheless, our mouse model revealed significant immune responses to all types of infections, which might partially explain the non-lethal phenotype in the majority of human population. In contrast to a severe pneumococcal infection, H1N1 infection of the colonized and non-colonized mice led to a full recovery after a bi-phasic course of infection. To track potential explanations for the observed infection phenotype, we analyzed local and systemic immune responses. Irrespective of the infection type, high cytokine levels mostly associated with the myeloid immune cell compartment were observed. One of the main features of CCL2/MCP-1 is the recruitment of monocytes to the site of infection30,31. In line with this, an increase of total monocytes was noted in the lungs of all infected mice. IL-1 family cytokines stimulate CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL1 expression32,33, and elevated levels of CXCL1 are linked to the recruitment of neutrophils34. IL-1β was mostly detected in the lungs of mice challenged with pneumococci and consequently, elevated neutrophil influx was found in single bacteria and co-infected animals. The effect of local IL-1β production can be further attributed to the fact that pneumococci are potent inducers of inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1β release35,36. Furthermore, high IL-6 levels were observed in lungs of all infected mice. IL-6 production is mainly associated with highly pathogenic IAV viruses37 and has a protective role in IAV infections38,39. Our results show that even mild H1N1 infection is a potent inducer of protective IL-6 levels.On the cellular level, impaired neutrophil recruitment to the lungs is associated with bacterial overgrowth in co-infections40. Our results show a neutrophil-independent immune response to a viral infection underlining earlier findings stating that monocytes rather than neutrophils play a crucial role in IAV infections41. However, IAV infections induce an apoptotic death of monocytes42, which is most likely reflected by a decrease of non-classical monocytes in mice lungs. As a potential compensation mechanism, we observed elevated frequencies of classical monocytes. Lung resident immune cells, including AMs, fulfill an important role in tissue homeostasis and resolution of the inflammation9. It has been reported that IAV infections deplete AMs10,43,44. Our analyses demonstrated that total AM and IM levels remained unaffected at the early onset of viral infections. This fact is further supported by in vitro analyses. Bacteria-eliminating properties of human and mouse monocytes/macrophages were not impaired in H1N1 infected cells. In contrast, reduced frequencies of both cell types were detected in single bacterial infection. IMs are most likely involved in inducing an anti-inflammatory state through IL-10 production and, thereby, inhibiting DC maturation and activation45. pDCs and cDCs were shown to have redundant and yet essential functions in viral infections of the lung15. pDCs limit viral replication and spread via type I and III interferon production46. However, it was demonstrated that infection with the pandemic H1N1 leads to a persistent depletion of pDCs47. In our experimental approach, cDC counts were reduced in single viral or pneumococcal infection, while pDC counts remained unaffected. In contrast, co-infections were characterized by elevated numbers of pDCs and unchanged cDC counts.To initiate adaptive immune responses, it is of crucial importance for cells of the innate immune system to upregulate MHCII expression48. Furthermore, upregulation of CCR2 is an essential mechanism for cell trafficking from bone marrow to the site of infection24. Hence, upregulation of these two molecules is indicative of cell activation. We observed mainly bacteria-driven expansion of MHCII+ and CCR2+ vascular neutrophils, AMs, and CCR2+ IM1 populations. Furthermore, the majority of analyzed cells, except for monocytes, displayed an activated phenotype. Whether elevated CCR2 expression is beneficial or harmful is still under debate. Several studies have linked influx of CCR2+ cells to lung injury in mainly IAV-mediated lung infections49,50,51. In contrast, CCR2+ cells are important for bacterial clearance52,53,54. At this stage, we can only speculate that the observed downregulation of CCR2 on monocytes and simultaneously increased expression on other cells might benefit bacterial clearance in healthy mice resulting in a full recovery from single viral and co-infections.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the early onset of bacterial and viral co-infections is associated with cytokine production, an activation of resident macrophages, and an influx of mainly activated neutrophils. In contrast, infiltrating monocytes display a presumably suppressive phenotype. Such immune responses to a mild virus infection and a colonizing pneumococcal strain might contribute to the clearance of the pathogens in healthy mice. Future studies tracking the local and systemic innate immune responses as a whole and elucidating the role of comorbidities or high age are warranted.MethodsEthics statementBuffy coats of blood provided by the blood bank at the University Medicine Greifswald were used. The buffy coats were provided anonymously. The ethical research committee at the University Medicine Greifswald approved the study (ref. no: BB 014/14). All experiments were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the regulations of the German Society for Laboratory Animal Science (GV-SOLAS), the European Health Law of the Federation of Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) and in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. All experiments were approved by the Landesamt für Landwirtschaft, Lebensmittelsicherheit und Fischerei Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (LALLFV M-V, Rostock, Germany; permit no. 7221.3-1.1-032/17).Bacterial and viral strainsStreptococcus pneumoniae 19F (EF3030), a nasopharynx isolate from a child with frequent otitis media episodes55,56, was kindly provided by Anders P. Håkansson (Lund University, Sweden). 19F was grown on blood agar plates (Oxoid) and cultivated to mid-log phase (optical density [OD]600, 0.35–0.40) in Todd-Hewitt broth (Carl Roth) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract (Carl Roth) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Influenza virus A/Bavaria/74/2009 (H1N1) was propagated as described by Eisfeld and colleagues57.Mice infections, monitoring, and samplingTo ensure reproducibility of the results, two independent experiments with different infectious conditions were performed. Groups of 4–12 female C57BL/6J mice (8–12 weeks old; Janvier Labs) were intranasally colonized or infected under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia with S. pneumoniae 19F or H1N1. For colonization with S. pneumoniae 19F, 20 µl PBS containing 1 × 107 CFU were administered. For pneumonia, 1 × 108 CFU in 20 µl PBS were applied. For viral infections, 42 µl PBS containing 10,000–250,000 PFU were used. Control mice were mock-treated with an equivalent volume of PBS. Animals were observed daily for weight and clinical score monitoring (Table S1).At different time points, mice were euthanized with isoflurane and blood, BALF, NAL, and lungs were harvested. BALFs were obtained by rinsing the lungs with 1 ml PBS. NALs were collected by rinsing the nasopharyngeal cavity with 1 ml PBS through the trachea. Blood was collected through cardiac puncture. For differential blood count, 2.5 µl of blood were used. The blood smear was stained with a Pappenheim staining kit (Carl Roth). Plasma was obtained by centrifugation (10 min, 1000×g) and stored at − 80 °C.To obtain single cell suspensions for flow cytometry, lungs were transferred into a 2 ml tube (Eppendorf), minced with sterile scissors in 1 ml digestion solution (1.5 mg ml−1 collagenase A, 0.25 mg ml−1 DNase (both Sigma Aldrich) in RPMI (HyClone)), and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking (1000 rpm). To stop the digestion process and to obtain bacteria free cell suspensions, FCS and antibiotic [Penicillin G (20 μg ml−1) and gentamicin (120 μg ml−1)] were added to the samples, respectively. The resulting cell suspensions were strained through a 70 µm cell strainer and treated with RBC lysis solution.Flow cytometryPrior to the cell staining, unspecific binding of immunoglobulins was blocked using 1 µg TruStain FcX PLUS (BioLegend) according to manufacturer’s instructions. All incubation steps with titrated amounts of monoclonal antibodies were carried out for 15 min at 4 °C in the dark. Washing steps were included between each staining step. Before analysis, cells were fixed with the True-Nuclear Transcription Factor Buffer Set (BioLegend) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies are summarized in Table S2. Peripheral cells were labelled via i.v. injection of 3 µg anti-CD45 antibody (30-F11, APC) 3 min prior to euthanization58. The gating strategy is shown in supplementary Fig. S3. Data were acquired with a LSR Fortessa flow cytometer using FACS DIVA Software and analyzed using FlowJo version 10 software (all BD Bioscience).Measurement of inflammation in body fluidsCytokine concentrations of digested lung supernatants and plasma were measured via LEGENDPlex mouse inflammation panel (13-plex) kit (BioLegend) according to manufacturer's instructions. Data were acquired with a FACSAria III cell sorter using FACS DIVA Software (both BD Bioscience) and analyzed using LEGENDPlex software (BioLegend). General inflammation in BALF was determined using Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to manufacturer's instructions.Eukaryotic cells, culture conditions, and infectionsTo isolate human monocytes, PBMCs were isolated from buffy coats by Lymphoprep (Axis-Shields) gradient centrifugation. Cells were allowed to adhere in cell culture flasks (Corning) for 30 min at 37 °C in serum free RPMI1640 media (HyClone). The non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS (HyClone). The remaining monocytes were detached and 1 × 106 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates (Corning) to allow the monocytes to rest over-night in cell culture media containing 10% (v/v) FCS (Invitrogen). Expression of CD14 and CD16 by these cells was confirmed via flow cytometry.Human monocyte-derived macrophages were generated by culturing primary human monocytes in 6-well plates for 6 days at a density of 2–3 × 106 cells/well, with a media change on day 4. Monocytes were differentiated to M1 macrophages in cell culture media containing 25 ng ml−1 GM-CSF for 6 days, followed by LPS (100 ng ml−1) stimulation for additional 2 days. Monocyte-derived M2 macrophages were generated by stimulation of monocytes in cell culture media containing 50 ng ml−1 M-CSF for 6 days, followed by additional IL-4 (20 ng ml−1) stimulation for 2 days. J774A.1 mouse monocytes/macrophages (ATCC TIB-67) were cultured in RPMI1640 containing 10% (v/v) FCS. All cells were cultured under 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere.All infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) 50 in a final volume of 3 ml of the respective media. Intracellular bacteria were quantified using the antibiotic protection assay59. For the assay, the cells were washed and infected with pneumococci. For the assessment of intracellular bacteria, 4 h after infection (t−1), the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with media supplemented with penicillin G (20 μg ml−1) and gentamicin (120 μg ml−1) for additional 1 (t0) to 5 h (t4) or 24 h 1 (t23). Subsequently, the cells were washed and lysed, and the CFU counts were determined.Bacterial and viral quantification in mice samplesTo quantify bacterial load in mice, NAL, BALF or lung homogenates were serially diluted and plated on blood agar plates (Oxoid). The remaining cell-free BALF and NAL were stored for further analyses at − 80 °C.To quantify viral load in mice, total RNA was isolated from the lungs using the RiboPure RNA purification Kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer's instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR amplification was performed with the SYBR GreenER Kit (BioRad). The levels of β-actin transcription were used for normalization. The following primers were used: NP-for, 5′-TCCGTCCTTCATTGTTCCCG-3′; NP-rev, 5′-TCCCACAAGAGGGGTCCAGA-3′; m-betaAct-for: 5′-AAATCTGGCACCACACCTTC-3′; m-betaAct-rev, 5′-GGGGTGTTGAAGGTCTCAAA-3′.StatisticsStatistical significance of differences between all treatment groups was determined using the Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test. The presented figures depict comparisons to PBS control group. Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001). ReferencesLim, W. S. et al.

The study, "A Pragmatic Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the Department of Defense," or PAIVED, is conducted by the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program at the Uniformed Services University and supported through the Defense Health Program. The study is being conducted at 10 DOD sites, including JBLM. Susan Chambers, a registered nurse who is the clinical site manager supporting USU’s Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program at Madigan Army Medical Center, said the study focuses on active-duty service members and other beneficiaries. Despite the high receipt of annual flu vaccination in the military population, there continues to be a significant rate of influenza illness, she said. “We are comparing three types of [Food and Drug Administration]-approved flu vaccine to see if there is one that performs better,” Chambers said. The comparison will provide important information on immune response to and effectiveness of the different flu vaccines. More than 18,000 people are participating in the study, which organizers said will assist in a better understanding of the influenza vaccine, how to better protect participants and loved ones from the flu, and help advance military medicine. Influenza remains a significant threat to operational readiness in the U.S. armed services, organizers said.

Study organizers will analyze results to determine comparative vaccine effectiveness in order to inform future vaccine purchasing decisions. “The goal is to see whether one of these three is better in our military population at preventing influenza,” Colombo said, “and if we find that there’s not one that’s better, that they all appear to work equally, then that’s also very informative.” Colombo said that type of information can help inform policy about purchasing a vaccine, because if one vaccine works better than another, Defense Department and Defense Health Agency leadership can focus on purchasing the more effective shot. “Right now, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices don’t recommend one of these vaccines over another,” Colombo said. “We want to make sure that the decision and policy is guided by science so that our beneficiaries and service members are receiving what is likely to work best."

At the enrollment desk, people find out if they’re eligible to take part in the study, provide informed consent, and give a brief medical history. Before receiving their vaccination, participants can choose to take part in an optional cheek swab or give a blood sample as part of the study. “We are looking at whether our genetics impact immune response and therefore make a difference in the effectiveness of the vaccine,” said Chambers. Participants are then randomly assigned to receive one of the three FDA-approved vaccines; the type is recorded in a study database. The vaccines are randomized, meaning participants can’t pick which vaccine they’re given, and no placebos are given. Participants are provided details on the vaccine they receive, provided a vaccine administration card and the vaccine is documented in the military immunization database and medical record. “The vaccines are given just as they would be given at standard of care,” she said, “so they’re in the same dose and volume as you’d get routinely.” Once participants are vaccinated, they receive small take-home kits containing a nasal swab and additional finger-stick items for them to take their own samples approximately 14 days after receiving their vaccinations. “The reason we provide that nasal swab kit now,” Colombo said, “is that then we make sure that the participants have it available so that if they begin feeling ill, and meet certain criteria for having what we call ‘an influenza-like illness,’ they can collect their swab, which makes it more likely that we’ll be able to identify what pathogen is causing their illness. “Hopefully, they will not become ill, and won’t ever have to use the swab,” Colombo added, “but that’s why they’re given all the instructions.” Cynthia Baker, right, a registered nurse at Madigan Army Medical Center supporting the Uniformed Services University's Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program, swabs the inside cheek of Sgt. 1st Class Patience Waycaster, the Regional Health Command-Pacific Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention program manager, as part of the flu vaccine study.

Begun in 2018, the study was supposed to end in 2020, but with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, “The world got all turned around and upside down,” Colombo said. “One of the interesting phenomena that occurred is that there were very low rates of influenza during 2020-2021, nationwide and within the DOD also,” she said. “We actually had to expand the enrollment numbers and years of enrollment to include this year, so that we’re able to follow enough influenza-like illness and detect enough influenza to be able to be confident in our determination of whether or not there are any differences between the vaccines at being able to prevent influenza,” Colombo added. Given that the world is still dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, the study directors said that it’s important that people get vaccinated against both COVID-19 and the flu, especially since flu rates were low last year. “With the capacity of hospitals being maxed out, it’s very important to get your flu vaccine,” said Dr. Christina Schofield, an associate professor at USUHS and principal investigator of the PAIVED study. A recent study indicated that the possibility of a ‘twindemic’ of flu and COVID-19 this winter is quite real, and some people may be concerned about getting a COVID-19 vaccination and a flu shot close together; Schofield said the concern is unnecessary. “You can receive those [vaccinations] at the same time. In fact, I did just that yesterday,” Schofield said, chuckling, "One in one arm, and one in the other. And the flu arm was sore first.” Cynthia Baker, left, a registered nurse at Madigan Army Medical Center supporting the Uniformed Services University's Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program, explains next steps in the flu vaccine study to Stein Sorenson, a supply management, transportation and readiness specialist with Regional Health Command-Pacific. Soldiers and civilian employees receiving flu vaccinations are part of a four-year study to compare the effectiveness of three existing vaccines in preventing influenza infection. (Photo Credit: Christopher Larsen) VIEW ORIGINAL Chambers said the possibility of a heavy flu season, along with the continued threat of COVID-19, reinforces the need to apply personal and public health measures to minimize the impact of circulating flu and COVID by getting vaccinated against both. "Some military treatment facilities, such as Madigan, are administering both immunizations at the same time during mass vaccination clinics," she said. Study organizers said the flu vaccine data collection will continue until May 2022, after which results will be tabulated in order to determine the most effective vaccine. Studies such as the flu vaccine study give active-duty service members and other beneficiaries the opportunity to take part in world-class research, with a goal of continuing to provide top-notch medical care to America’s armed forces.

However, in the past few decades, the knowledge of ncRNAs has been increased dramatically due to their transcriptional ability and multiple regulatory functions. Typically, regulatory ncRNAs include long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), miRNAs, piRNAs, Y RNAs, vault RNAs, and circular RNAs (circRNAs), etc. Previous studies have revealed that various ncRNAs are involved in the host responses to virus infection and play critical roles in the regulation of host-virus interactions. In this review, we discuss the conceptual framework and biological regulations of ncRNAs to elucidate their functions in response to viral infection, especially influenza A virus (IAV) infection. In addition, we summarize the ncRNAs that are associated with innate immunity and involvement of interferons and their stimulated genes (ISGs) during IAV infection. Introduction DNA, together with RNA, is the fundamental carrier of genetic information. Transcriptomic analysis has revealed that 70–90% genome is transcribed, in which only approximately 2% is translated into protein (Djebali et al., 2012). Researchers have long focused on mRNAs that bear protein-coding capacity, while non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been widely shown as “Junk” transcriptional byproducts with less meanings. However, ncRNAs which are transcribed from DNA but not encode proteins carry crucial biological information. From the late 1950s, the era of the rRNAs and tRNAs discovery has gradually opened the knowledge world of ncRNAs, since then many studies show that ncRNAs participate in the regulation of gene expression at the levels of transcription, RNA processing, and translation (Cech and Steitz, 2014). Generally, ncRNAs are involved in regulating biological, developmental, and physiological processes, even serving as molecular markers of some diseases (Pavet et al., 2011; Salzman, 2016; Adams et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2018; Liu C. X. et al., 2019). Besides, the expression pattern of ncRNAs usually changes in response to various viral infections, indicating that ncRNAs play important roles in modulating viral infection by different mechanisms (Li et al., 2015; Ouyang et al., 2016; Liu Z. et al., 2021; Othumpangat et al., 2021). Influenza virus is mainly classified into four subtypes based on the antigenicities of nucleic protein (NP) and matrix protein (M), including influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus (IBV), influenza C virus (ICV), and influenza D virus (IDV) (Hause et al., 2013; Long et al., 2019). IAV belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family and its genome consists of eight negative single-stranded RNAs. IAVs are important zoonotic pathogens that can infect diverse host species including birds, pigs, and humans, causing mild to severe respiratory disorders and posing continuous threats to public health. It is known as one of the dominant pathogens that has led annual economic losses through seasonal epidemics and causing four major epidemics (1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009) worldwide (König et al., 2010). In addition, IAVs are further classified into 18 hemagglutinin (HA) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) in animals and humans according to the genetic and antigenic variability of the two surface proteins, while H17N10 and H18N11 are only identified in bats (Tong et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014). Typically, IAVs, entering the host through nasal or oral pathway, are usually countered by the mucus that covers the respiratory epithelium. Once the viruses successfully get through the mucous layer, the HA receptor-binding site immediately attaches the virus to cell surface receptors (α2,3- or α2,6-linked sialic acid residues) to facilitate the internalization of virus by endocytosis. In the process of endosomal trafficking, pH-dependent fusion of viral and endosomal membranes leads to release of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) into the cellular cytoplasm. Then, the released vRNPs are transported into nucleus to initiate replication and transcription of viral RNAs for production of progeny viruses. These events can trigger multiple machineries in the interaction between IAVs and hosts. Thus, the host factors including ncRNAs and proteins are usually required in the regulation of viral replication in the process of IAV infection. Host antiviral immune responses are stimulated once the viruses invade host cells. Innate immunity comes as the first defense line against the viral infection (Gu et al., 2019). Upon infection of IAV, the host innate immunity is activated through recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Studies have shown that IAV can be recognized by multiple classes of PRRs of the innate immune system, including the Toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and the NOD-like receptor family member NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3). Various PAMPs generated from IAVs such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA, sensed by TLR3), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA, sensed by TLR7 and TLR8), and 5′-triphosphate RNA (sensed by RIG-I) lead to the induction of the expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), IRF3, or IRF7 to induce a large number of cellular cytokines to fight with viruses (Rehwinkel et al., 2010; Biondo et al., 2019). In addition, the Matrix ion channel activity of IAV in the Golgi can promote the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in the release of cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 (Pang and Iwasaki, 2012). These cytokines, generated by the host, can bind with receptors to activate the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which exert a broad antiviral spectrum. Consequently, signaling cascades induced by viral proteins or viral nucleic acids prevent viral replication and establish antiviral status (Darnell et al., 1994; Li et al., 2019). Many studies have revealed that ncRNAs function as negative or positive regulators in the host antiviral immunity through various mechanisms in the process of viral infection (Pedersen et al., 2007; Umbach and Cullen, 2009; Vierbuchen and Fitzgerald, 2021). In this review, we summarize the current roles of ncRNAs, typically including long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), miRNAs, piRNAs, Y RNAs, vault RNAs (vtRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), especially in their functions as regulators in fighting with IAV infection through innate immunity pathways. Characteristics and Modes of Action of Non-Coding RNAs Exciting outcomes reveal that discovery of higher eukaryotic transcriptome has opened a new door for the study of ncRNAs (Rinn and Chang, 2012; Morris and Mattick, 2014). In eukaryotes, various ncRNAs are produced during transcription and RNA processing in different genomic regions of eukaryotes. Specific regions of DNAs could be transcribed into ncRNAs, including transposon elements, protein coding genes, and enhancer regions. Regulatory ncRNAs (lncRNAs, miRNAs, piRNAs, Y RNAs, vtRNAs, and circRNAs, etc.) are expressed at certain stages (transcriptional, post-transcriptional, or epigenetic levels) and can modulate the expression of other genes at the level of transcription or translation. LncRNAs are designated as transcripts bearing over 200 nt in length with no protein-coding capacity. Based on their locations in the genome, lncRNAs can be divided into sense, antisense, bidirectional, intronic, and intergenic lncRNAs (Rinn and Chang, 2012; St Laurent et al., 2015). The currently annotated lncRNAs released from GENCODE in humans (version 35) and mice (version 25) are 17,957 and 13,197, respectively (Frankish et al., 2021). The number of annotated lncRNAs is continuing to increase, indicating the research hotspots and the critical roles of lncRNAs in the biological processes (Frankish et al., 2021). However, some of the interpreted lncRNAs contain open reading frame (ORF), which encode micropeptides, indicating that the accurate annotation and classification of lncRNAs need further to be studied (Pueyo et al., 2016; Bhatta et al., 2020). LncRNAs are involved in various biological processes such as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, mRNA splicing, processing, transport, and translation (Sun et al., 2018). Further studies show that lncRNAs are involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation (Wang et al., 2014), cell growth (Wang et al., 2008), nuclear organization (Sun et al., 2018), cancer cell biology (Schmitt and Chang, 2016; Tang et al., 2018; Vafadar et al., 2019), and inactivation of X-chromosomes (Wutz, 2011). Additionally, lncRNAs can also act as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) or miRNA sponges in the process of cancer (Poliseno et al., 2010; Shan et al., 2018; Kong et al., 2020) and virus infection (Chai et al., 2018) to protect target mRNAs from degradation. More importantly, various studies have confirmed that lncRNAs are involved in modulating immune responses against IAV infection (Table 1). TABLE 1 Table 1. Regulatory ncRNAs. MiRNAs, generated from hairpin loop-like transcripts, are the most abundant and well-studied class of short ncRNAs (Reinhart et al., 2000; Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001). MiRNAs have profound effects against viral immunity by affecting mRNA inhibition and silencing of target genes (Pedersen et al., 2007; Umbach and Cullen, 2009; Table 1). Most mammalian miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as primary RNA (pri-miRNA), which is cleaved into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) by RNase III Drosha to form a stem-loop in the nucleus (Bartel, 2004). Then, the pre-miRNAs are transported to cytosol by exportin-5 and are cleaved by Dicer into miRNA duplex. One arm of the miRNA duplex binds with Argonaute (AGO) protein in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to act as a guide sequence for targeted mRNAs to silence genes by inducing mRNA degradation or inhibiting the translation (Krol et al., 2010). However, unlike miRNAs, piRNAs bind to PIWI protein (a specific member of the AGO family) to form a piRNAs-induced silencing complex, resulting in silencing the transcriptional and post-transcriptional target points (Siomi et al., 2011). Y-RNAs are another regulatory RNAs involved in cellular stress response, RNA stability, and DNA replication (Christov et al., 2006; Kowalski and Krude, 2015). Recent studies have revealed that Y-RNAs performed critical roles in host defense against viral infection through exosome delivery (Liu Y. M. et al., 2019). VtRNAs are barrel-shaped ncRNAs, commonly found in eukaryotic cells, which contain large numbers of ribonucleoprotein particles called vaults (Kedersha and Rome, 1986; Kedersha et al., 1991). Most vtRNAs exist in a free form and function in a non-structural way (Kickhoefer et al., 1998; Nandy et al., 2009), which are involved in the interaction between virus and host, especially by regulating the innate immune response (Li et al., 2015; Table 1). Circular RNAs (circRNAs), firstly identified in Sendai virus and plant viroids, form covalently closed rings structurally and are produced by pre-mRNA back-splicing during post-transcriptional processing. Advanced deep sequence analysis drafted uniqueness of the circRNAs and found that circRNAs ranged in size from 100 to 10,000 nt (Salzman et al., 2012; Jeck et al., 2013; Ye et al., 2015). In terms of their unique ring structure, circRNAs have no terminated 5′ end caps or 3′ poly (A) tails, thus indicating the highly stable nuclease resistance (Starke et al., 2015). Accumulating evidences have indicated that circRNAs play vital roles in the regulation of IAV infection (Yu et al., 2019; Liu Z. et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2021; Table 1). Functional Involvement of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Regulation of Influenza a Virus Infection Recent studies on lncRNAs have reported their interactions with immune responses to various diseases. Some lncRNAs have also been studied under the influence of IAV, but the exact nature of these lncRNAs remains unclear. It is known that thousands of different lncRNAs were expressed to control IAV infection, some of which directly or indirectly affect the functional roles of viral protein or alter cell metabolism by regulating the immune system. From the mechanical perspective, this study emphasizes the role of specific lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of IAVs. Differential Expression of Long Non-Coding RNAs During Influenza a Virus Infection The IAV manipulates host factors to reduce the antiviral response and promote viral replication, resulting in a large number of infections. The analysis of differential expression of lncRNAs in IAV infection showed that most lncRNAs had similar regulatory effects in IAV, but differentially expressed in SARS-CoV infection (Peng et al., 2010). These studies showed that the differential expression of lncRNAs in the process of viral infection was controlled by innate immunity signaling (Peng et al., 2010). Additionally, a similar discovery was made by Josset et al. (2014) who performed RNA sequence on 8 different strains of mice and found 5,329 differentially expressed lncRNAs after IAV infection. Furthermore, sequence analysis of human lung cells (A549) was used to investigate different response pathways during IAV infection, and the expression of lncRNAs under different conditions was also reported. These lncRNAs have been studied by regulating autophagy, cellular metabolic reactions, and immune response, and are involved in IFNs signaling pathways of IAV infection (Ouyang et al., 2016; More et al., 2019; Unfried and Fortes, 2020). Taken together, these studies established a strong association between IAV infection and lncRNAs expression, suggesting that the expression patterns of lncRNAs after infection of IAV might be an effective diagnostic tool in clinical trials. During viral infection, lncRNAs act as regulators and participate in regulation, thereby inhibiting or promoting viral replication. Regulatory Roles of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Influenza a Virus Infection LncRNA transcripts are larger than 200 nt and are involved in the complexity of genome evolution (Amaral et al., 2008; Ponting et al., 2009). Several studies unraveled the functional mechanisms of regulatory lncRNAs, including LncRNA-VIN (Winterling et al., 2014), IPAN (Wang J. et al., 2019), LncRNA-PAAN (Wang et al., 2018), PSMB8-AS1 (More et al., 2019), TSPOAP1-AS1 (Wang Q. et al., 2019), lncRNA ISR (Pan et al., 2019), Lnc-MxA (Li et al., 2019), LncRNA-155 (Maarouf et al., 2019), NRAV (Ouyang et al., 2014), IVRPIE (Zhao et al., 2020), and Lnc-ISG20 (Chai et al., 2018; Table 1). These lncRNAs have negative or positive roles in the regulation of viral replication by exerting multiple mechanisms. LncRNAs can directly modulate IAV replication through targeting viral proteins. LncRNA-VIN is upregulated in the process of IAV infection. The silencing of lncRNA-VIN results in the reduction of viral protein synthesis of HA, NP, NS1, and M2, thereby inhibiting the production of IAV (Winterling et al., 2014). LncRNAs can also directly target viral proteins to regulate IAV replication. Loss-of-function screening analysis reveals that IPAN, an influenza virus PB1-associated ncRNA, is induced by IAV infection and promotes IAV infection by preventing PB1 degradation (Wang J. et al., 2019). Knock down the expression of lncRNA-PAAN can significantly impair the polymerase activity of IAV, resulting in the reduction of progeny viruses. Further study shows that lncRNA-PAAN directly target viral PA protein of IAV to promote virus replication (Wang et al., 2018). PSMB8-AS1 can be induced by both IAV infection and IFN-β1. The reduction of this lncRNA leads not only to the decreased of mRNA expression of viral NP and NS1 genes but also to the decreased protein expression of NP, NS1, and PB1, resulting in the reduction of the progeny viruses (More et al., 2019). The proliferation of virus in host cells is a complicated dynamic process. It is well known that IAVs hijack cellular protein synthesis machinery to promote viral infection. However, the balance of infection between IAV and host might be tipped by lncRNAs through targeting different viral proteins. Considering that the large numbers of host lncRNAs, the detailed and specific mechanisms in viral regulation still need to be further studied. In addition to directly target viral proteins, lncRNAs can function in antiviral immunity via regulating IFNs or ISGs. TSPOAP1-AS1 can be induced by IAV infection and IFN stimulus. It promotes IAV replication by decreasing IFN-β transcription, lowering ISGs expression, and suppressing the activation of interferon sensitive response elements (ISRE), however, the specific regulatory mechanism still needs to be determined (Wang Q. et al., 2019; Figure 1). LncRNA ISR, known as IFN-stimulated lncRNA, is significantly upregulated in the presence of IAV infection. During IAV infection, it enhances IFN-β production via RIG-I-dependent signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting viral replication (Pan et al., 2019; Figure 1). Lnc-MxA is a negative regulator of antiviral response and plays potent roles in immune homeostasis. It inhibits IFN-β transcription by the formation of a DNA-RNA complex at the IFN-β promoter site, thereby promoting IAV replication (Djebali et al., 2012; Figure 1). LncRNA-155, derived from MIR155HG, strongly increases the virulence and replication of IAV by indirectly affecting the expression of ISGs. In the process of IAV infection, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is significantly inhibited by lncRNA-155, resulted in the increased expression of IFN-β and some key ISGs, thus guiding the immune response against IAV infection (Maarouf et al., 2019; Figure 1). NRAV, a downregulated lncRNA, can promote IAV replication and virulence in vitro and in vivo. Further study shows that NRAV can suppress the initial transcription of multiple ISGs such an IFITM3 and MxA through affecting histone modification of these genes (Ouyang et al., 2014; Figure 1). Recently, a novel lncRNA, IVRPIE, has been identified by transcriptome analysis in patients infected with IAV, which inhibits viral replication by promoting the transcription of ISGs (IFIT1, IFIT3, IRF1, Mx1, ISG15) and IFN-β. Furthermore, IVRPIE is associated with hnPNPU, which mediates the ISGs and IFN-β regulation through histone modification (Zhao et al., 2020; Figure 1). Similarly, lnc-ISG20, IAV-induced upregulated lncRNA, has a common sequence with ISG20 mRNA, which serves as a new ISG against IAV. In addition, it works as ceRNAs, binding to miR-326, promoting ISG20 mRNA transcription to ISG20 protein, and inhibiting viral replication (Chai et al., 2018; Figure 1). The influence of these lncRNAs on the negative or positive regulation of critical factors of innate immunity, including IFNs and ISGs, indicate that lncRNAs are crucial regulators in the process of IAV infection. Although large numbers of lncRNAs have been identified by using deep sequence, only a few of them have been characterized and studied during IAV infection. Considering that various host factors are involved in innate immunity, it is reasonable to speculate that there must exist more lncRNAs interacting with other transcriptional factors. FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Host lncRNAs regulate various steps of antiviral immune responses against IAV infection. Upon IAV invading host cells, the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) signaling pathway is initiated to activate transcription factors, including NF-κB and IRF3/7. Then, the transcription factors bind to the corresponding active sites to induce the transcription of IFNs, which activates auto- or paracrine pathways to initiate ISGs to defend viral infection through JAK-STAT pathways. Many lncRNAs are involved in the cascades to regulate different steps of the signaling pathway to inhibit or promote IAV replication. Roles of Short Non-Coding RNAs in Influenza a Virus Infection Short ncRNAs such as miRNAs, Y-RNAs, and vtRNAs utilize various molecular mechanisms in the regulation of IAV infection. Although the specific functional roles of miRNAs between host and virus interaction seem to be mysterious, the molecular mechanism of miRNA is clear, by hybridizing to target mRNAs and regulate their expression levels post-transcriptionally. Typically, various studies have shown that miRNAs modulate the interaction of host and IAV through targeting genes of IAV or regulating host innate immune responses (Zhang et al., 2014; Chen X. et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Liu C. C. et al., 2021). On the one hand, some miRNAs, such as hsa-miR-593-5p, hsa-miR-487b-5p, hsa-miR-486-5p, and hsa-miR-127-3p, were found to directly target gene segments of IAV and efficiently inhibited IAV replication (Peng et al., 2018). Similarly, miRNA-192 and miRNA-192-5p have shown the potential gene silencing ability to design novel live attenuated influenza vaccines by inserting the miRNA target sites into IAV genomes (Langlois et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2020). These studies show that miRNAs have potential to be used as diagnostic tool in IAV infection and promote the design of live attenuated IAV vaccines. On the other hand, multiple miRNAs are involved in the regulation of innate immunity during IAV infection. For example, IFN pathways usually are the primary targets in the regulation of miRNAs. The reduction of miR-21-3p in the patients’ serum and A549 cells infected with H5N1 resulted in the downregulation of FGF2, which facilitated the replication of H5N1 virus by impeding type I IFN response (Shi et al., 2020). In another study, miR-93 was downregulated in IAV infected alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in the promotion of IFN-JAK-STAT pathway via JAK1 upregulation, and enhanced the antiviral effect of type I IFN to suppress IAV infection (Guo et al., 2020). Liu C. C. et al. (2021) found that silencing STIM1 could promote the expression of miR-223, resulting in the alleviation of IAV-induced inflammation injury by inactivating NLRP3 and inflammasome, indicating that miR-223 was an important regulatory component in the STIM1/miR-223/NLRP3 axis. Lin et al. (2020) showed that miR-30 could inhibit the expression of SOCS1, SOCS3, and NEDD4, and thus positively enhanced type I IFN signaling pathway and IFITM3 expression, resulted in the reduction of progeny viruses of IAV. In addition, miRNAs can also influence IAV infection by regulating some host proteins, such as the Wnt-Ca2+ signaling receptor frizzled 5 (Yang et al., 2021), TNKS2 (Bamunuarachchi et al., 2021), and mTOR (Sharma et al., 2020). MiRNAs are also detected in exosomes, and they are involved in the host defense against IAV infection (Maemura et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2021; Othumpangat et al., 2021), indicating that these miRNAs might be the potential biomarkers for disease resistance. Previous studies have shown that both viral and host proteins participate in the regulation of host restriction of IAVs (Long et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). However, in a recent study, Song et al. (2020) found that ssc-miR-221-3p and ssc-miR-222 were related to the host barrier during IAV interspecies infection, indicating that miRNAs played crucial roles in the host range restriction. Collectively, miRNAs are involved in the regulation of IAV infection through various molecular mechanisms including regulating IAV genes, host gens, or factors of the innate immunity. However, the interactions of IAVs and host genes or proteins are dynamic and balanced processes, and the regulatory patterns of miRNAs still need to be clarified in the future. Y RNA-derived small RNAs (YsRNAs) are small fragments produced by degradation of Y RNAs. Although the nature and functions of YsRNAs remains unclear, studies show that YsRNA might be further processed into miRNA-like small RNAs, and might become potential biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis (Dhahbi et al., 2014). In fact, hsa-miR-1975 has been proved to be derived from the degradation of Y5RNA in the process of apoptosis and shows antiviral effect against IAV infection (Liu Y. M. et al., 2019). However, the functional roles and molecular mechanisms of Y RNAs and YsRNAs during virus infection are still unknown. VtRNAs, together with vault proteins, form a ribonucleoprotein complex called vault particles. VtRNAs, including vtRNA1-1, vtRNA1-2, vtRNA1-3, and vtRNA2-1, are important components of vault particles (Kickhoefer et al., 1998). A recent study has shown that vault proteins regulate virus induced proinflammatory responses (Peng et al., 2016). Thus, it is not surprising that vtRNAs are differentially expressed after Epstein-Barr virus infection and may function in innate immune response to regulate virus replication (Mrázek et al., 2007; Nandy et al., 2009). Li et al. (2015) established a novel axis to clarify the mechanism of vtRNAs during IAV infection. Typically, IAVs evade the protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated innate immune antiviral response by upregulating vtRNAs through viral protein NS1, indicating that vtRNAs, as long as other ncRNAs, are also involved in the host-virus interaction through innate immunity (Li et al., 2015). However, considering the complex formed by vtRNAs and vault proteins, whether vault proteins or the whole complex can regulate IAVs or other viruses still need further study. Take together, these preliminary findings have shown that short ncRNAs as long as lncRNAs, play vital roles in the regulation of IAV infections. More importantly, some particular miRNAs might be helpful as a diagnostic or a therapeutic tool in the surveillance of IAVs. However, more solid and profound evidences are still required in the future. Roles of Circular RNAs in Virus Infection Like other regulatory ncRNAs, circRNAs are initially misinterpreted as byproducts of RNA splicing that are produced form introns, exons, untranslated regions, intergenic regions, or tRNAs (Noto et al., 2017). However, recent studies show that circRNAs play important roles in the processes of biological regulation, including transcription and RNA splicing (Salzman, 2016), as well as function as miRNA sponges (Sun et al., 2016), and ceRNAs (Huang et al., 2016). Numerous circRNAs expressed genes are associated with enzyme activity, metal ion binding, nucleotide binding, and protein ubiquitination during reovirus infection (He et al., 2017). Furthermore, circRNAs are reported as disease diagnostic and predictive biomarkers (Qu et al., 2015) and they are also involved in the regulation of host-virus interaction (Awan et al., 2021). The exogenous circRNAs can trigger immune response to protect the host from viral infection. Chen Y. G. et al. (2017) found that cells transfected with exogenous circRNAs had a 10-fold lower Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus-GFP (VEEV-GFP) infection rate. Furthermore, RIG-I co-aggregated with foreign circRNAs, which was necessary for detecting foreign circRNAs (Chen Y. G. et al., 2017). In another study, Li et al. (2017) demonstrated that circRNAs were involved in viral infection via dsRNA-binding proteins namely NF90 and NF110. Upon Poly(I:C) stimulation or Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, circRNAs expression was decreased as a result of the export of NF90/NF110 to the cytoplasm. Meanwhile, NF90/NF110 was released from circRNA-protein complexes (circRNPs) and bound to viral mRNAs as part of their functions in antiviral immune response. The authors concluded a coordinated regulation of circRNAs biogenesis and function by NF90/NF110 in viral infection (Li et al., 2017). In a subsequent study by the same group, Liu C. X. et al. (2019) reported that circRNAs tended to form 16–26 bp imperfect RNA duplexes and act as inhibitors of PKR related to innate immunity. Upon poly(I:C) treatment or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection, circRNAs are globally degraded, which is required for PKR activation. Meanwhile, circRNAs reduction and aberrant PKR activation are found in autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Liu C. X. et al., 2019). Yu et al. (2019) studied the role of circular RNA GATA Zinc Finger Domain Containing 2A (circ-GATAD2A) in the replication of IAV H1N1 in A549 cells. The authors detected high expression of circ-GATAD2A in response to IAV H1N1 infection. Knockdown of circ-GATAD2A in A549 cells enhanced autophagy and inhibited H1N1 replication. The authors concluded that circ-GATAD2A promoted the IAV replication by inhibiting autophagy (Yu et al., 2019; Table 1). Although numerous studies have characterized the expression profiling of circRNAs during virus infection and large numbers of circRNAs have been identified involving in the regulation of host-virus interactions (Liu Z. et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021), the detailed molecular mechanisms are still limited and needs further investigation. CircRNAs can modulate IAV infection by functioning as endogenous sponges to compete with miRNA for binding to mRNAs. For instance, circ_0050463 is up-regulated in IAV-infected A549 cells and knockdown of circ_0050463 in A549 cells inhibits IAV replication. Moreover, circ_0050463 acts as an endogenous sponge of microRNA-33b-5p to sequester and inhibits miR-33b-5p activity. Taken together, this study indicated that circRNA_0050463 facilitated IAV replication via miR-33b-5p/EEF1A1 axis (Shi et al., 2021; Table 1). AIVR, another novel intronic circRNA, mainly localizes in the cytoplasm and absorbs the miR-330-3p that binds the mRNA of CREBBP to work as a miRNA sponge, leading to large expression of CREBBP and accelerating IFN-β production (Qu et al., 2021; Table 1). Liu C. C. et al. (2021) reported that 7,126 circRNAs were expressed in the lungs of mice infected with H7N9 or H7N9 PB2-mutant viruses, of which 186 were differentially expressed. This result shows that differentially expressed circRNAs have vital roles in immune regulation against viral infection (Liu Z. et al., 2021). Viral circRNAs have been identified in various classes of viruses including coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 (Yang et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2021), oncogenic viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi’s sarcomaassociated herpesvirus (KSHV), human papillomavirus (HPV), etc. (Avilala et al., 2021; Tagawa et al., 2021), as well as IAVs. However, to date, only a few of these viral circRNAs are functional identified. Some of these viral circRNAs act as miRNA sponges to regulate viral pathogenesis. In addition, viral circRNAs, detected in IAV infected cell lines or lungs, are available in Virus Circ Base, which will be helpful for the future study (Cai et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). Collectively, the discoveries of viral circRNAs are dramatically increased and gained more attention on these ncRNAs, which will be initiating an exciting new era of viral circRNAs. Conclusion and Perspectives Although progresses have been made in understanding of the critical regulatory roles of ncRNAs against IAV infection, research in this field is still in its infancy stage. Some of the small ncRNAs, such as miRNAs and piRNAs modulate the virus-host interaction through silencing genes. However, most of other ncRNAs, including lncRNAs, circRNAs, and those small ncRNAs, take advantage of various molecular mechanisms to regulate the interactions between virus and host. The uncertainty of various mechanisms employed by ncRNAs makes it difficult for further research. Benefited from the deep sequencing technology and rapid advance of bioinformatics, sufficient evidence indicates that ncRNAs are crucial regulators in the complicated interaction network between the virus and host. The infection caused by IAV poses continuous threats to human health and animal husbandry. Thus, the development of novel targets for therapeutics or biomarkers of IAV infection to promote the early diagnosis or treatment seems to be very important. Although accumulating evidences have demonstrated that ncRNAs are participated in the regulation of innate immune response, especially in the PRRs sensing pathway, the activation of transcription factors, the production of ISGs, and cell apoptosis, the possible regulation mechanisms of ncRNAs during IAV infection still need to be further studied. The intensive study of these ncRNAs will provide optional approaches for the prevention and control of IAVs. For instance, the expression of miRNAs in serum isolated from human patients with IAV infection shows different profiles, indicating the potential of miRNA as biomarkers. But for lncRNAs and circRNAs, the potential roles on the diagnosis need to be further studied with the limited molecular mechanism known. The altered expression or activity of these pivotal innate immune molecules significantly influences the host antiviral response and thereby affects the viral infection and replication. Interestingly, some ncRNAs acting as negative regulators of innate immunity can be hijacked by virus to inhibit the antiviral response, and some others functioning as positive regulators can be suppressed by virus during the infection. These findings provide strong evidences supporting the key role played by the ubiquitous and versatile lncRNAs in antiviral innate immunity. However, although thousands of ncRNAs are associated with viral infection, the number of ncRNAs with experimentally functional verified is limited. Therefore, intensive studies are still needed to define the expression, regulation and functioning of ncRNAs during virus infection. Overall, future studies tend to provide a more comprehensive picture of the interaction of host ncRNAs and viral infections, and shed light on the roles of ncRNAs in the antiviral response process.

Flu season is in full swing and college students living in a campus environment that combines close living quarters with communal dining facilities and large classrooms can be particularly at risk. That’s why UMKC School of Pharmacy students at the school’s Springfield campus are partnering with Missouri State University Magers Health and Wellness to sponsor the “Bear the Band-Aid” flu shot challenge. The campaign is meant to raise an awareness of the importance of receiving an annual flu vaccine, said Paul Gubbins, Pharm.D., associate dean for the UMKC School of Pharmacy at Missouri State University. “We started the Bear the Band-Aid campaign in September 2016 in an attempt to increase the vaccination rates on the MSU campus,” Gubbins said. “Our effort was based on a 2016 report by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases that noted influenza vaccination rates are typically very low on college campuses.” The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that nearly 8 percent of Americans will get sick from the flu virus each year. That means more than 26 million people developing flu symptoms. Outreach efforts by Springfield pharmacy students included an article in a Missouri State campus newsletter where they noted that while most college students recognize the risk of flu to the very young or old, they often underestimate their own risk. Gubbins said the initiative has met with mixed results. While a study has shown the vaccination rate on the Springfield campus to be higher than the reported rate on college campuses across the nation, there is still a need to increase awareness of the need to receive the vaccine. At the same time, among those who have been vaccinated previously, the campus campaign has created a greater awareness, Gubbins said. “We feel it augments everything that MSU already does to make the influenza vaccine easily accessible to its students,” Gubbins said. As of early October, nearly 2,000 employees and students on the Springfield campus had received the vaccine. In addition to the awareness campaign, the campus pharmacy students are also active in delivering influenza vaccinations to those in Springfield and Greene County. Throughout a given flu season, Gubbins said his students will administer as many as 700 to 900 influenza vaccines throughout the community. In Kansas City, UMKC pharmacy students have been active in administering vaccines at the university’s flu vaccine clinics in September and October. Pharmacy students from UMKC’s three campuses in Kansas City, Columbia and Springfield also collaborate with pharmacies, clinics and organizations throughout Missouri each year to typically provide nearly 3,000 flu shots to patients throughout the state. The regional American Pharmacists Association-Academy of Student Pharmacists organization honored the UMKC School of Pharmacy in 2019 with an Operation Immunization chapter award. It recognized the extraordinary contributions pharmacists provide to improving vaccination rates in their communities. The UMKC chapter also received the national recognition in 2012.

In fact, the latter might be the most important thing you do in the autumn.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyThe Northern Hemisphere flu season runs from October to May. Experts recommend getting a shot earlier rather than later in the season, so you have immunity built up before the peak flu time, which falls between December and February.While we had a mild flu season last year because people were following COVID-19 protocols of masking and social distancing, influenza is nothing to sneeze at. Between 2010 and 2020, the CDC estimated that the flu resulted in anywhere between 12,000 and 52,000 deaths (and between 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations) annually.Of course, plenty of other viruses are also always circulating during winter, including the common cold and respiratory infections. When you’re fighting off an illness, is getting a flu shot still the right thing to do — or is it better to wait?Can you get a flu shot if you’re sick?It depends. “The general guidance is it depends on how sick you are,” says Donald Ford, MD, MBA, Chairman of the Department of Family Medicine at Cleveland Clinic. “If you have a mild illness or a cold — what we normally think of a routine viral infection — there’s absolutely no reason why you can’t go ahead and get your flu shot, which is protection against a more severe viral infection.”AdvertisementHowever, if you have a fever — which for adults is classified as a temperature over 100.4° F (38° C) — or are otherwise feeling unlike yourself, Dr. Ford recommends rescheduling for another day.“The temperature is one marker,” he says. “If you’re sick enough that you’re staying home from work, if you’re having trouble keeping food down or staying hydrated, those would be all reasons to at least postpone it.”Are there risks to getting a flu shot when you’re sick?If you do get a flu shot when you’re sick, don’t worry — you won’t hurt yourself or make yourself sicker. However, it’s best to let your body focus on dealing with your existing illness.“The immune system is preoccupied with fighting off what you’re already sick with,” says Dr. Ford. “And so you want your system in a prepared state. That way when you get the vaccine, you get a good response. And that bolsters your immunity to influenza that will hopefully last you through the whole flu season.”In a perfect world, getting a flu shot would ensure you stay healthy. But if you get sick a few days after getting a flu shot, will that hurt your chances of developing immunity for the season?Thankfully, likely not. “The immune response to any vaccination happens fairly quickly, typically within the first 24 to 48 hours,” says Dr. Ford. “So if you find yourself sick later on — it’s a funny thing, because people always say, ‘Well, I got sick from the flu shot.’ However, the illness was probably there to begin with, and you just hadn’t started feeling symptoms. As long as your symptoms are minimal, your body’s going to have a great chance to mount the immunity.”Can a flu shot make you get sick?It isn’t out of the ordinary to react to the flu shot, as it’s simply a sign that your immune system getting to work protecting you. Common responses include a sore arm, headache, nausea, muscle aches or a mild fever. “The vaccine itself is adapted every year,” Dr. Ford says. “So it’s very hard to predict, from one year to the next, if you’re going to have a mild reaction, no reaction or a more problematic reaction.However, if you do get sick after getting a flu shot, it’s not because of the vaccine. “The only direct reactions to the shot are going to happen within the first 24 to 48 hours,” Dr. Ford affirms. “As mentioned before, if you get sick after that, people might think it’s related to getting the flu shot. But it’s just a coincidence.”When should you cancel a flu shot if you’re sick?Deciding to cancel a flu shot can be a game-time decision. “People can wait pretty close to when they’re getting it,” says Dr. Ford. “Most of us have experienced colds and wintertime viruses, and there’s usually an arc to them. You usually know when you’re starting to get better. Typically, they only last a few days, sometimes up to a week.”The key is paying close attention to your symptoms — and determining whether you’re on the upswing or downswing of that arc. “If you’re getting better and your flu shot is scheduled for the next day, you’re probably fine,” Dr. Ford says. “If you’re still feeling bad or getting worse, then that might be the time to at least check with your doctor about whether you should proceed.”AdvertisementErring on the side of caution and postponing your appointment until you feel better is never a bad idea, however. “Flu shots are widely available in doctor’s offices,” Dr. Ford says. “They’re in all the pharmacies. If you’re not sure if you should go ahead and get it, it really isn’t a big deal if you delay it by a day or two.”AdvertisementLearn more about our editorial process.AdvertisementRelated ArticlesOctober 29, 2024/Children's HealthRSV vs. Pneumonia: Sorting out Your Child’s Fever and CoughRSV can lead your child to develop pneumonia and have trouble breathingOctober 23, 2024/Cold, Flu & Respiratory IllnessesWhat Is Respiratory Season, and Are You Ready?Getting vaccinated in October can help protect you against severe illness between November and MarchOctober 8, 2024/Mental HealthHands Off!

Should I get a flu shot this year? Two vaccines to protect your family this fall With new variants of the coronavirus and influenza circulating this fall, being protected is more important than ever. Every fall, health care providers urge people to get their influenza vaccine. But only about 40 percent of Iowans actually take this advice. And in Iowa, only 66.7% of the eligible population has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. COVID-19 Vaccine Many hospitals are operating on limited capacity. In addition to an increased number of COVID-19 cases and spread of the COVID-19 variants, hospitals are dealing with traumas, experiencing multiple types of illness and strains of illness typically only seen in winter. This demand is coupled with a reduced number of staff to care for patients. These challenges can strain available resources and contribute to delays in care or other complications for patients. Healthy behaviors, healthy community One year ago, many people embraced the importance of hand hygiene, surface cleanliness and respiratory etiquette. These behaviors helped lead to a much less intense influenza season than usual. The CDC reported a record number of flu vaccines were distributed in the U.S. last year—193.8 million doses. Last year had the lowest recorded influenza-associated hospitalizations since data collection began in 2005. What’s the difference? Confusion about influenza, often referred to as "the flu," still circulates. Some people think influenza is just a bad cold. Others think it is a stomach “bug”. There are big differences, though. Using the term "the flu" interchangeably for the respiratory virus and stomach illness leads to more confusion. Like COVID-19, influenza is a respiratory virus. And just like COVID-19, people can get sick and die from influenza. We have the best tools available The best way to protect yourself and your family and loved ones against influenza and COVID-19 is to get vaccinated for both. Everyone 6 months and older, with few exceptions, should get an annual flu vaccine and everyone 12 years and older is eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. It is important to receive your influenza vaccine early. Influenza cases are expected to start increasing in October, and it takes about two weeks for the antibodies to build up and offer protection. The CDC says that for those elligible for both the flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine, that they can be administered at the same time without regard to timing. Contact your health care provider if you have questions. Don't wait to get your influenza vaccine. Vaccines are already available in many areas; contact your local MercyOne provider today.

(Pixabay: Sambeetarts)abc.net.auews/influenza-virus-yamagata-eradication-vaccine-covid-pandemic/100546836Link copiedShareShare articleAs COVID-19 spread to hundreds of millions of people around the world, another potentially lethal disease — influenza — hardly reared its head at all.Key points:Historically low global flu rates during the pandemic may have eradicated one flu typeAustralia's 2022 flu vaccine will still include it, but it may be dropped the year afterAs the country opens borders, vaccination against flu will be more important than everAnd seasonal flu rates globally have been so low for the past 18 months, it looks as though one flu virus has been stamped out altogether.Two studies — one published in Nature Reviews Microbiology in September and the other currently under review — show one of four flu viruses that infect humans each year hasn't been detected anywhere in the world since April 2020.So does that mean it's gone for good? It's still too early to say.There is a chance this particular virus — the Yamagata virus — might be lurking in a pocket of the world somewhere, according to Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute, and co-author of one of the studies."It may re-emerge, but we haven't had a single detection of that virus in 18 months."That's unusual, so it could be gone. We hope it's gone."Which is good news. But ... while Australia's historically low flu count over the pandemic has undoubtedly saved lives, it also means the population may be a sitting duck when autumn and winter roll around next year.But more on that later. First: how did the Yamagata virus disappear?Catch up on the latest COVID-19 news hereA fraction of the fluThe extent to which the flu has been crushed by the COVID-19 pandemic is extraordinary.On average, around 100,000 flu cases are detected in Australia each year, and a few hundred people die from it, although those numbers do bounce around year to year.In 2019, one of our worst flu seasons in recent times, more than 300,000 people became sick and more than 900 died from flu.This year so far in Australia, there have been just 550 reported flu cases — and not a single flu death.Wearing a face mask and other non-pharmaceutical interventions work well to limit flu spread — not just COVID. (ABC News: Patrick Rocca)"We did have early cases in 2020, going up 'til about March, April," Professor Barr said."But after that, the cases dropped off, and haven't really reappeared since."Some parts of the world, such as countries in the Middle East, East Asia and West Africa, still endured flu outbreaks during the pandemic.But Australia's experience isn't an outlier either. Europe, China and the US also reported extremely low flu rates over the past two years.The vanishing virusThe Yamagata virus belongs to the influenza B group of flu viruses. With very rare exceptions, this group only infects humans.Because they don't jump between humans and other animals, they won't cause a pandemic, unlike influenza A viruses, such as the one that causes swine flu.But influenza B viruses are still behind roughly a quarter of total flu infections each year.Something else that sets them apart from influenza A viruses is they mutate slowly.Coronavirus questions answeredPhoto shows An illustration of a cell on an orange background with the word 'coronacast' overlayed.Breaking down the latest news and research to understand how the world is living through an epidemic, this is the ABC's Coronacast podcast.Viruses that mutate quickly are more likely to evade the protection we get from vaccines.The Yamagata virus, Professor Barr says, "has slowed down in terms of evolutionary change over the last 10 years".This, plus the fact that it doesn't hide out in animals, had some scientists thinking the Yamagata virus might eventually be wiped out by vaccination alone.Then COVID-19 hit. Social distancing, better hygiene and masks all contributed to driving flu levels down, and finished off the Yamagata virus faster than expected.But what had the biggest effect, Professor Barr said, was closed borders.Flu viruses generally don't survive summer, so each country's flu season is kicked off and sustained by a constant influx of new viruses brought in from travellers abroad during autumn and winter.When international arrivals are put in quarantine for two weeks, that chain is broken.Loading..."The quarantine stations have been a bit of a godsend for us, especially the one at Howard Springs," Professor Barr said."The majority of [flu] viruses we've had this year in Australia have come through the quarantine station."So the viruses are coming in, but they're just not getting out — or if they are getting out, they're only getting out in very small numbers."How does this affect the flu jab?The Yamagata virus is one of four we're protected against by the yearly quadrivalent flu vaccine in Australia.The flu vax protects against four virusesTwo influenza A:H1N1 was first detected in the Americas in 2009 and caused the 2009-10 swine flu pandemicH3N2 was behind the 1968 flu pandemic, which killed an estimated 1 million people worldwideTwo influenza B:B/Victoria tends to infect younger peopleB/Yamagata may now be eradicatedDespite not being seen for 18 months, the Yamagata virus might yet make a comeback, so will be included in next year's flu vaccine."We don't have sampling in every corner of every village in every country of the world, so there is probably a good chance that the virus is still out there," Professor Barr said."Whether it gets back into the mainstream or not remains to be seen."I think we need to be cautious. This virus, only a couple of years ago, was one of the dominant viruses in circulation. It can circulate widely, and it can cause illness and hospitalisations and death."But if it's still undetected next year, then 2023's flu vaccine may drop the Yamagata component, and become a trivalent or three-part vaccine.And that would be a good thing in some ways, Professor Barr added, because a vaccine made with three components is cheaper to make, and could help get more flu vaccines into developing countries.Most flu vaccines manufactured today are made using eggs, a technique developed in the 1930s. (Supplied: CSIRO)And what about the 2022 flu season?As Australia begins to reopen borders and NSW ditches hotel quarantine next month for passengers fully vaccinated against COVID-19, new flu viruses will trickle in and spread."But we're in a situation now, which we've never been before, where flu viruses haven't circulated, essentially, in two winters in Australia," Professor Barr said.Because we've not been exposed to the flu for a couple of years, the population doesn't have much in the way of flu immunity at the moment.COVID's transition from pandemic to endemicPhoto shows A blurred image of commuters in face masks walking during rush hour.Most experts agree that eradicating COVID-19 is now almost certainly out of the question — so what's the path forward from here?The longer borders are closed, the more that herd immunity wanes.On top of this, flu vaccine uptake has been particularly low this year.Only around a third of the total population is vaccinated against the flu, Professor Barr says."While older people have held up well — 75 to 80 per cent of people over 65 are vaccinated — it's the kids and adults who are way down on their vaccinations compared to previous years."And that makes us more susceptible."Getting as many people as possible vaccinated against the flu next year will be the best way to keep a lid on flu numbers over winter as viruses inevitably arrive on our shores."2022 could be a very interesting year," Professor Barr said."I'm sure influenza will be back once borders are open. And then it's just a numbers game, whether we have a moderate season or we have a big season."Read our full coverage on COVID-19 hereLoading...Loading...Posted Wed 20 Oct 2021 at 6:00pmWednesday 20 Oct 2021 at 6:00pmWed 20 Oct 2021 at 6:00pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

[Photo/Xinhua] BEIJING -- China has kicked off annual seasonal influenza vaccination. Medical workers, participants of major events, vulnerable people at nursing homes and welfare houses, as well as those at child-care centers, kindergartens, elementary and secondary schools are among priority groups to promote flu vaccination, according to a document released by the State Council inter-agency task force for COVID-19 response. People aged 60 and above, children between six months and five years old, patients of chronic diseases, and people with high risks of infection are also key potential recipients of vaccination, said the document. Localities are encouraged to inoculate priority population groups for free and a minimum 14-day interval is required between flu vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines. An annual flu vaccine is the best way to protect against influenza, said experts. It can significantly reduce the risks of flu infection and serious complications. Compared with the same period of 2020, China has observed a higher level of flu activity in its southern and northern regions and a notable increase of flu activity in the southern part since September. There remains a risk where COVID-19 outbreaks might combine with the incidences of respiratory infectious diseases during the upcoming winter and spring seasons.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved NEWS Health News Clinical Trial Shows Cell-Based Flu Shot Works Well in Kids By Korin Miller Published on October 22, 2021 Fact checked by Nick Blackmer Print Getty Images Close Key Takeaways A new study has found that a cell-based flu shot works well in children as young as 2 years old.There is just one vaccine of this type that is currently licensed in the United States.Experts say that the new data from the study makes the case for lowering the age for cell-based flu shot for children. For years, egg-based influenza shots have been the norm. However, there are also other ways to make flu vaccines that do not involve eggs. A recent study of one alternative—a cell-based flu shot—showed that it's effective at preventing influenza in kids as young as 2 years old. Experts say that the promising results back up the decision of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to lower the age for using cell-based shots in kids to help protect them against the flu and its complications. Last week, the organization approved a cell-based option called Flucelvax for kids as young as 6 months. Why You Really Need a Flu Shot This Year The Study The new study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is the first to look at the absolute efficacy of a cell-based flu shot in children as young as 2 years old. Currently, the only cell-based flu shot licensed for use in the United States is the Flucelvax Quadrivalent, which is the vaccine used in this study. It is available for children 6 months and up. The researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial including 4,514 participants in Australia, Thailand, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Poland, Spain, and the Philippines to look at the efficacy of a cell-based shot called Flucelvax Quadrivalent across three flu seasons. The results showed that the cell-based shot was 54.6% effective overall at preventing the flu in children. However, the efficacy varied by flu type. The study showed that the cell-based shot was: 80.7% effective against influenza A/H1N1 42.1% effective against influenza A/H3N2 47.6% effective against influenza B The Different Flu Viruses The efficacy was the same regardless of the participant’s age, sex, race, and whether they had previously received a flu shot. How Flu Vaccines Are Made The FDA has approved three different flu vaccine production technologies in the U.S.: Egg-basedCell-based fluRecombinant flu Egg-Based Most flu vaccines that are used in the U.S. are created through an egg-based manufacturing process. It starts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) giving manufacturers candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) that have been grown in eggs. The CVVs get injected into fertilized hen’s eggs and are allowed incubated for several days to give the viruses a chance to make copies of themselves (replicate). While most people do not need to worry about a flu shot being made with eggs, people with egg allergies may need to get a different type of vaccine. Next, the liquid that has the virus in it is removed from the eggs. If the manufacturer is going to create an inactivated flu virus—which is what flu shots are—the virus is then killed and the virus antigen is purified. The CVVs in the nasal spray vaccine are live but have been weakened (which means that they cannot make you sick). For the final step, the fluid is put through quality testing and packaging before being distributed. Intranasal Flu Vaccine Shows Promise Cell-Based The cell-based flu shot process is a little different. First, the CDC gives manufacturers CVVs that have been grown in cells. Next, the CVV is put into cells cultured from mammals (instead of putting them in eggs). Here, the viruses are given a few days to replicate. As with the egg-based vaccines, the fluid is collected from the cells and the virus antigen is purified. Once it’s ready to go, it’s packaged up, tested and checked, before finally heading to distribution. Flu shots made with a cell-based candidate vaccine viruses can offer better protection than traditional, egg-based flu vaccines because the viruses that are used to make them are often more similar to circulating “wild” flu viruses than the viruses that are used to make egg-based vaccines. Recombinant The recombinant flu vaccine does not use a CVV. It’s created with a gene that can provide the genetic instructions for making a surface protein found on influenza viruses called hemagglutinin (HA). It’s this antigen that triggers the human immune system to create antibodies to specifically fight the flu virus. To produce a vaccine, the gene for making the antigen is put together with a baculovirus (which mostly infects insects and does not cause illness in people). The baculovirus helps get the genetic instructions for making the flu virus HA antigen into the cells in the host cell line, where it quickly starts making the HA antigen. From there, it’s grown in bulk, collected, purified, and packaged as a recombinant flu vaccine. As with the other vaccines, it’s tested and checked to ensure that it’s ready to make its way to your arm. Flu Vaccine Recommendations The CDC recommends that everyone age 6 months and older get a flu vaccine each season (though there are rare exceptions). People with a severe egg allergy should receive either a cell-based flu vaccine or recombinant vaccine (neither of which is made with eggs). The CDC suggests that you get a flu shot at least by October, if not as early as September. When Is It Too Late to Get a Flu Shot? What Doctors Think Infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells Verywell that the study’s findings are “not surprising” given how well cell-based flu vaccines have performed in the past. “We have seen cell-based influenza vaccines outperform traditional influenza vaccines in adults for some time,” says Adalja. “No flu vaccine is extremely efficacious against mild disease, but when it comes to what matters most—preventing serious disease, hospitalization, and death—the efficacy is much higher than 54.6%.” Flu Shot May Help Protect Kids from COVID Richard Watkins, MD, an infectious disease physician and a professor of internal medicine at the Northeast Ohio Medical University, tells Verywell that, “the results are exciting and hopefully will lead to another option for flu vaccines for children.” Adalja says that the flu is a “challenging virus” and there are “still limitations on how accurate the vaccine will be” compared to the strains of the virus that circulate each season. That’s why he stresses the importance of getting children vaccinated against the flu. Richard Watkins, MD The results are exciting and hopefully will lead to another option for flu vaccines for children. — Richard Watkins, MD While it may not entirely prevent a child from getting the flu, Adalja says that getting vaccinated does help prevent them from getting “severe complications of influenza” as well as helps “prevent them from spreading the infection.” The research is promising, but it remains to be seen what the new data will mean for the future availability of cell-based flu shots for younger children in the U.S. What This Means For You The CDC recommends that (with a few rare exceptions) everyone age 6 months and older get a flu shot each year.

This is in spite of mask-wearing, physical distancing and COVID-19 preventive measures helping to greatly reduce the number of influenza cases reported in the region last year. 24/7 San Diego news stream: Watch NBC 7 free wherever you are "San Diegans are more likely to be out and about this flu season and that could lead to more people getting sick from influenza," said Dr. Cameron Kaiser, county deputy public health officer. "The best protection we have against the flu is getting vaccinated. The vaccine is safe and effective and can help prevent people from getting sick, ending up in the hospital or, worse, dying." Get top local stories in San Diego delivered to you every morning. Sign up for NBC San Diego's News Headlines newsletter. The County Health and Human Services Agency has begun publishing the weekly Influenza Watch report, which tracks key influenza indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region. The report is released every Wednesday during the flu season. For the week ending Saturday, the report shows the following: Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness were 3% of all visits, same as the previous week;Total influenza deaths to date: 0, same at this time last season; andTotal lab-confirmed cases to date: 215 -- compared to 7 last season and an average of 145 at this date for the past five years. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. Local Elections Nov 5 Voting results: Here's how San Diego County voted in the 2024 election San Diego Oct 16 Join NBC 7 and Telemundo 20 in honoring military families at Salute to Service Festival 2024 presented by Toyota "Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza," Kaiser said. People with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women, people age 65 years and older and people who live with or care for others who are at higher risk are all more likely to get seriously sick from the flu. The influenza vaccine is now available at doctors' offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the county's six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the county's Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1- 1 San Diego. In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick: wash hands thoroughly and often;use hand sanitizers;stay away from sick people;avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth;clean commonly touched surfaces; andif you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others. Last season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. In 2019, a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza and more than 20,700 flu cases were reported.

Tests by the state research centre showed that a relatively new strain of lethal avian flu known as H5N8 was circulating, and within days 900,000 birds at the Vladimirskaya plant were hurriedly slaughtered to prevent an epidemic.Avian flu is the world’s other ongoing pandemic and H5N8 is just one strain that has torn through thousands of chicken, duck and turkey flocks across nearly 50 countries including Britain in recent years and shows no sign of stopping.But the Astrakhan incident was different. When 150 workers at the farm were tested, five women and two men were found to have the disease, albeit mildly. It was the first time that H5N8 had been known to jump from birds to humans.View image in fullscreenA civet cat on a wildlife farm in Tonglu, Zhejiang province. Thousands of the animals were slaughtered in China as suspected spreaders of the Sars virus. Photograph: John Footy/EPAThe World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted but, this being at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, little attention was paid even when Anna Popova, chief consumer adviser to the Russian Federation, went on TV to warn “with a degree of probability” that human-to-human transmission of H5N8 would evolve soon and that work should start immediately on developing a vaccine.Global attention is fixed on the origins of Covid-19, either in nature or from a laboratory, but eight or more variants of avian flu, all of which are able to infect and kill humans and are potentially more severe than Covid-19, now regularly rattle around the world’s factory farms barely noticed by governments.We are seeing an unprecedented explosion in outbreaks of new bird flu virusesDr Michael GregerThere have been no further reports of human H5N8 infections in 2021, but concern last week turned to China, where another type of avian flu known as H5N6 has infected 48 people since it was first identified in 2014. Most cases have been linked to people working with farmed birds, but there has been a spike in recent weeks and more than half of all the people infected have died, suggesting that H5N6 is gathering pace, mutating and extremely dangerous.WHO and Chinese virologists have been worried enough to call on governments to increase their vigilance. “The likelihood of human-to-human spread is low [but] wider geographical surveillance in the China affected areas and nearby areas is urgently required to better understand the risk and the recent increase of spillover to humans,” said a WHO Pacific-region spokesperson in a statement.View image in fullscreenA crane reflected in water at Shanghai zoo. Though wild birds are blamed for spreading disease, one virologist says: ‘Blaming migratory waterfowl … is no longer a tenable position.’ Photograph: Eugene Hoshiko/APEarlier this month, China’s Centre for Disease Control [CDC] identified several mutations in two recent H5N6 cases. The spread of the H5N6 virus is now a “serious threat” to the poultry industry and human health, said Gao Fu, CDC director, and Shi Weifeng, dean of public health at Shandong First Medical University. “The zoonotic potential of AIVs [avian influenza viruses] warrants continuous, vigilant monitoring to avert further spillovers that could result in disastrous pandemics,” they say.Factory farming and diseaseThe WHO suspects, but has no proof, that Covid-19 is linked to the intensive breeding of animals in south-east Asia’s many barely regulated wildlife farms. Major outbreaks over the past 30 years including Q fever in the Netherlands and highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks have been linked with intensive livestock farming. Governments and the £150bn-a-year poultry and livestock industries emphasise how intensive farming is generally extremely safe and now essential for providing fast-growing populations with protein, but scientific evidence shows that stressful, crowded conditions drive the emergence and spread of many infectious diseases, and act as an “epidemiological bridge” between wildlife and human infections.Covid and farm animals: nine pandemics that changed the worldRead moreUN bodies, academics and epidemiologists recognise the link between the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and increasingly intensive poultry farming. According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO): “Avian influenza viruses are evolving into a large, diverse virus gene pool … A pathogen may turn into a hyper-virulent disease agent; in monocultures involving mass rearing of genetically identical animals that are selected for high feed conversion, an emerging hyper-virulent pathogen will rapidly spread within a flock or herd.” Wild birds are routinely blamed by governments and industry for spreading avian flu along migratory routes, but evidence is mounting that intensive farms are potential “mixing pots” for new, deadly viruses.“Blaming migratory waterfowl … is clearly no longer a tenable position,” says Rob Wallace, an American virologist who argues that the new strains of flu emerging are adapting to industrial poultry production. “Influenza’s infiltration into industrial livestock and poultry is so complete that these farms now act as their own reservoirs [of disease],” he says. “They are their own source.”View image in fullscreenA duck farm in Zhangzhou, Fujian province, where 400,000 ducks a week were being slaughtered when H7N9 bird flu hit China’s poultry market. Photograph: AFP/GettyWith more than 20 billion chickens and nearly 700 million pigs being farmed at any one time, Wallace says the chances of new flu strains and variants emerging and spilling over to humans are high.He is backed by Sam Sheppard, a biologist at Bath University, who says overuse of antibiotics, overcrowding and the genetic similarity between animals provide ideal conditions for many bacteria, viruses and other pathogens to merge, mutate, spread and then jump into humans.Sheppard researches how keeping animals penned together triggers genetic changes in common bugs such as campylobacter, which are now widespread in poultry, pigs and cattle. “These first emerged in the 20th century, coinciding with large increases in the number of farmed cattle. The bugs are now resistant to antibiotics as a result of overuse of medicine,” he says.Nor is it just poultry and pigs. The emergence of respiratory diseases such as Mers in camels, coronaviruses in mink farms and BSE in cattle suggests that the intensive breeding of any animal increases the risks of infection.View image in fullscreenA laboratory at the Centre of Disease Control in Beijing. ‘Avian influenza viruses are evolving into a large, diverse virus gene pool,’ says one UN agency. Photograph: AFP/GettyThe next pandemicMarius Gilbert, an epidemiologist at the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium, and others have shown how bird flu is linked to the rapid intensification of poultry farming, which is now making bird flu viruses more dangerous.Public health experts have long warned about the dangers of industrial farming but since Covid the stakes have become higher as the full costs of a modern pandemic are seen, says medical doctor and historian Michael Greger, author of the book Bird Flu: A Virus of Our Own Hatching.Greger argues that there have been three eras of human disease: first, when we started to domesticate animals about 10,000 years ago and were infected with their diseases, such as measles and chickenpox; then in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the Industrial Revolution led to epidemics of diabetes, obesity, heart disease and cancer; and now, because of the agricultural intensification that is leading to zoonotic, or animal-borne, diseases such as bird flu, salmonella, Mers, Nipah and Covid-19.“In evolutionary terms, rearing poultry, cattle and pigs in high-intensity, crowded, confined, entirely unnatural conditions may be the most profound alteration of the human-animal relationship in 10,000 years,” he says“We are seeing an unprecedented explosion in outbreaks of new bird flu viruses, which historically have presented the greatest pandemic risk and certainly have the potential to be worse than Covid.”Could gene editing chickens prevent future pandemics?Read moreGilbert says it is not just factory farming that leads to dangerous avian flu, but changes humans are making to the wider environment. “Most viruses which circulate in wild birds are of low danger and cause only mild effects. [But] from time to time they enter the poultry system, where they go through evolutionary change, mostly linked to the conditions in which the animals are farmed. We have seen low-pathogen viruses gain pathogenicity in farms.”This can set up a vicious circle where a virus mutates on a farm and then spills back into the wild bird population where it can spread further via migratory pathways, he says. “Every time people are infected there is a danger that viruses become more dangerous or transmissible.”Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

News Flash Health Department - News Posted on: October 21, 2021[ARCHIVED] It's Time for Your Flu Shot Es tiempo de recibir tu vacuna contra la influenza (gripe)Now is the time for everyone six months and older to get vaccinated against flu (influenza). Flu vaccines protect against serious illness and are especially important during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends getting the flu vaccine before the end of October. We are seeing sporadic flu cases in Washtenaw County, indicating that transmission is already at higher levels than last year. Local flu activity typically increases during or after the December holidays. “Last year, COVID-19 prevention measures like masking, staying home, and handwashing helped us have unusually low flu activity,” says Juan Luis Marquez, MD, MPH, medical director at the Washtenaw County Health Department. “We don’t know how severe this flu season will be, but we know that as more people resume ‘normal’ activities and gatherings, it is easier for flu and other illnesses to spread. Getting your flu shot can help you avoid serious illness and keep the people around you safer.”Vaccination can protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death due to flu, as well as reduce the overall spread of illness. Getting vaccinated can protect people around you, including those who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness, like babies and young children, older people, and people with certain chronic health conditions.“As we’re heading into flu season, we continue to see high levels of COVID-19 in our community. Widespread flu and COVID-19 vaccinations and continued use of masks in public spaces, handwashing, distancing, and staying away from others when sick helps us prevent serious illness, hospitalizations, and related deaths,” continues Dr. Marquez.Many of the same tools we use to prevent the spread of COVID-19 also help prevent the spread of flu. In addition to getting vaccinated, it is important to stay home if you are sick, cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough, wash your hands often using soap and warm water, and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs. See washtenaw.org/flu for ongoing information and surveillance on this year’s flu season.Where to Get VaccinatedFlu vaccine is widely available at area health care providers, pharmacies, and community events. See vaccinefinder.org for local options. Most people with insurance can get flu shots at their doctors’ offices or pharmacies without any additional cost.The Washtenaw County Health Department (WCHD) has a limited amount of flu vaccine for children and adults regardless of insurance status or income. WCHD will not decline services to clients if they are unable to pay. Call 734-544-6700 to schedule an appointment. Capacity and appointments will be limited due to ongoing COVID-19 vaccination and response efforts.About Flu and COVID-19Symptoms of the flu include coughing, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, sore throat, headache, fatigue, fever and/or chills. Flu and COVID-19 have similar symptoms. If you feel sick, get tested for COVID-19 or visit a health care provider and avoid being around others.

The flu can affect anyone, but older adults, children, and individuals with chronic health conditions are at greater risk for severe complications from flu – it is especially important that these individuals get vaccinated against the flu. Flu vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines can be given at the same time.

It’s the time of year when the chances of “coming down with something” increase.If you do end up with either a cold or the flu, you can take a proactive approach to support your body in recovering as fast as possible. Though there’s currently no cure for the common cold or flu, simply letting your sickness run its roughly 10-day course isn’t the only option. For starters, getting your flu shot can go a long way toward prevention. On top of that, you can boost your immunity even more to potentially prevent catching something in the first place.If you do end up getting sick, there are ways to help reduce symptom severity and speed you toward recovery.One way to do that is with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remedies that may stimulate your body’s natural healing capabilities. What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?TCM is a type of traditional medicine system that originated in China. It involves a comprehensive toolkit of complementary practices, including:herbalismdiet therapyphysical approaches like tai chi and qi gongacupuncturegua shacuppingmassage, or tuinasports medicineTCM’s philosophy is generally based on the Chinese concepts of:qi, the vital energy believed to guide physical and mental processesyin and yang, the opposing energies of lifeWu Xing, or five elements theoryAccording to Leng Tang-Ritchie, doctor of acupuncture and oriental medicine (DAOM) and director of clinical services at Pacific College of Health and Science, different factors may lead to the common cold and flu depending on how the condition presents in each individual person.“That means that we treat differently depending on whether the patient’s symptoms are predominately presenting as heat, cold, or even dampness,” says Tang-Ritchie.“In Western medicine, we describe it as a common cold or flu,” says Debbie Kung, DAOM and licensed acupuncturist (LAc). In TCM, she notes, the perspective focuses on the individual. “We actually look at it as different scenarios,” says Kung. “It could be a qi issue, a blood issue, or yin and yang issue — so it’s a little bit different.”An ounce of preventionStrengthening your immune system is the first step in preventing the cold or flu.“Keeping your immune system healthy is best,” advises doctor of acupuncture and Chinese medicine (DACM) Tom Ingegno. “Visits to your TCM practitioner during late summer and early fall can help build up your immune system with herbs and acupuncture that are specifically aimed at keeping you healthy.”So how do you keep your immune system in tip-top shape?Get plenty of rest.Focus on a nutritionally varied diet rich in fruits and vegetables.Find constructive ways to manage stress, like meditation.Get plenty of vitamin C. Traditional Chinese herbal remediesIn addition to prevention, TCM uses herbs and foods to help support your body’s natural healing function. According to Irina Logman, DACM and owner of the Advanced Holistic Center at Carillon Miami, “Practitioners can identify weak links in the patient’s constitution and prescribe a treatment plan to strengthen that element.” She suggests getting a personalized blend of herbs based on an assessment by a licensed professional. “Although individual herbs are great, the real magic comes in Chinese herbal formulas,” says Logman. “Chinese herbs and herbology are basically the backbone of Chinese medicine,” says Kung. “Herbs are actually the best thing when it comes to the common cold and flu.”Still, Kung cautions that there are important things to keep in mind when taking herbs, like:take only herbs suggested by a board certified TCM practitionertell your practitioner about any other medications you take or conditions you havetake herbs consistently for the prescribed period of time Licensed, board certified TCM practitioners are required to memorize over 3,000 herbs, dosages, and interactions with other herbs and medications. They can tell you: what kind of herbs you may needwhether to take them in capsule, tincture, or tea formhow often you should take themConsistently taking herbs is key to seeing the best results. Some common herbal formulations include:jade windscreen, or Yu Ping Feng Sana ginger, turmeric, and cinnamon blendGui Zhi TangYin Qiao SanJade windscreen powderThis is a classic herbal mix used in China since the Yu Ping Feng San dynasty, which translates as “jade windscreen” in English. The mix is a powdered blend of:astragalus rootatractylodes rhizomesiler rootIt’s used to bolster the immune system and safeguard the body from viral and bacterial infections. Warming herbs like ginger, turmeric, and cinnamonWhen sick, you can easily make yourself a warming tea with these common kitchen herbs.“When it comes to common colds and the flu, you want to break a sweat to get everything out,” says Kung. “These help to heat up the body in a way that’s not too dangerous. It pushes and brings on the sweat and helps to warm up the body.”Ginger is already known to be antiviral and antibacterial, and it helps with reducing nausea. Chop the ginger up and steep in hot water, adding honey or lemon to taste. Full of antioxidants as well as anti-inflammatory benefits, turmeric can be added to bone broth or taken in pill form. Like turmeric, cinnamon is also full of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. It can help fight bacterial and fungal infections. You can make a tea of cinnamon, Chinese dates, and ginger to help with cold and flu symptoms.Gui Zhi TangYou might recognize the ingredients in Gui Zhi Tang:cinnamonwhite peony rootfresh gingerChinese red dates, or jujube fruitlicorice roothoneyThis blend is recommended by Tang-Ritchie for a cold or flu that comes with:chillsbody achesclear nasal dischargeslight sweating“This formula will relieve body aches, encourage sweating, and act as a decongestant,” she says. “Patients should drink lots of warm fluids while taking this formula.”Yin Qiao SanFor colds that lean more toward a mild fever, chills, and a slight sore throat, Tang-Ritchie suggests the Yin Qiao San herbal formula. It includes:honeysuckle flowerspeppermint leavesfermented soybeans, or nattoforsythiabamboo leavesedible burdockballoon flower rootThe formula may help reduce thirst and fever and relieve a sore throat. “Both honeysuckle flowers and forsythia have strong antiviral properties,” says Tang-Ritchie. “Sometimes, Yin Qiao San is combined with a stronger antiviral formula called Gan Mao Ling (a common cold effective remedy) if the sore throat is more pronounced.”Take only herbs prescribed by a board certified, licensed TCM practitioner. Even though many of the above ingredients are mild, it’s always best to check with a professional when taking any herbs regularly.Traditional Chinese treatments for cold and fluTCM emphasizes holistic wellness and balance, which means it often involves more than one approach. The below treatments can support cold and flu prevention and recovery in addition to herbs. Gua ShaGua sha involves repeatedly scraping your skin in a downward motion with a tool after applying an unguent, like massage oil or balm. It can be performed by a TCM practitioner or you can do it at home if your practitioner shows you how.“Try gua sha on the chest and upper back,” suggests Ingegno. He notes that though we see many influencers using gua sha tools for facial treatments, one of its real uses is to break up congestion in the lungs. “By scraping these areas and breaking surface capillaries, we increase circulation to symptomatic areas and stimulate a healing response, including an increase in white blood cells,” Ingegno adds. AcupunctureAcupuncture involves inserting tiny needles into specific points on the skin to stimulate a desired response. It may calm inflammation caused by cold or flu viruses and help your immune system defend your body by promoting circulation, wound healing, and pain modulation.CuppingTCM practitioners can use cupping to create suction and increase blood flow to an area by placing cups on the skin. This can alleviate muscle tension and promote cellular and connective tissue repair.“Cupping and gua sha on the upper back can help clear congestion in the chest, reduce symptoms, and ease breathing discomfort,” explains Tang-Ritchie. “We use a combination of these techniques depending on the specifics of each patient’s case.”MoxibustionThe TCM practice of moxibustion involves burning moxa, a cone made of ground mugwort leaves, either directly on your skin or indirectly on acupuncture needles in your body. According to a 2018 research review, studies have shown that moxibustion can increase white blood cell count and immunity.Find a practitionerAlways be sure that you receive treatments like acupuncture, cupping, gua sha, moxibustion, and herbal remedies from a practitioner who holds an active professional license to practice in your state.You can search online for the professional licenses recognized by the state you live in.If you live in New York, for example, you can use a tool on the Office of the Professions website to check out your practitioner’s credentials.You can also check with the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) to see whether your practitioner is accredited.TakeawayTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers a broad toolkit of practices and herbs to help support you through the cold and flu season. As with all medical and complementary treatments, always seek treatment from a licensed medical professional. Never take herbs or perform any of the practices mentioned on your own without consulting a practitioner.Done properly, TCM practices can help you get through cold and flu season with a little extra support.Foods That Boost the Immune SystemVirginia Duan is the entertainment editor for Mochi Magazine and you can find her work on various sites like Scary Mommy, Romper, Mom.com, Diverging Mag, and Mochi Magazine.

By JERUSALEM POST STAFF OCTOBER 18, 2021 01:56 Health Ministry D-G Nachman Ash receiving a flu vaccine on October 17, 2021 (photo credit: HEALTH MINISTRY) Senior Health Ministry officials received flu shots on Sunday, in order to encourage Israelis to get the jab.The officials included Health Ministry D-G Professor Nachman Ash, Head of Health Service Dr. Sharon Elroi-Preiss, Head of Medical Division Dr. Vered Ezra and others."I am calling on the public also to get a flu vaccine for your health," Ash said. "The vaccines against the flu are the best way to protect the public from the virus," he said. Seasonal influenza is expected to reach exceptionally high levels this year, according to health officials. The virus is expected to arrive as early as November, posing a risk to the country’s health system which is still carrying the burden of hundreds of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Head of Health Services Dr. Sharon Elroi-Preiss receives her flu vaccine on October 17, 2021 (credit: HEALTH MINISTRY)Flu is one of the most common and highly infectious winter viruses. Similar to coronavirus, it is transmitted from person to person mainly by droplets exhaled when people cough, sneeze or even talk.Low turnout for the flu vaccine could even lead to a spike in influenza and once again threaten to overwhelm Israel’s hospitals, health officials said last week. “There is a real concern about the decline in the rate of people vaccinating for both flu and coronavirus,” Dr. Ehud Drucker, deputy of the Emergency Medicine Department at Samson Assuta Ashdod Hospital, said on Wednesday. “A combination of both viruses doubles the chances of serious illness and mortality, alongside a return to impossible workloads in the country’s hospitals.

Many people around globe are struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of the pandemic, much like a century ago with the Spanish flu. It is widely believed that COVID-19 has been just as deadly as the Spanish flu, if not more. More than 705,000 people have lost their lives to coronavirus in the U.S. alone, beating the grim record previously held by the Spanish flu. When the Spanish flu broke out, the population of the U.S. was one-third of what it is currently, and the death toll was as high as 675,000. This is one reason why it is still debatable whether the pandemics can be compared or not. The scientific advancements that have been made in the last century led to the faster development of COVID-19 vaccines. However, new variants are still showing up, and the efficacy of these vaccines is in doubt. The Spanish flu never went extinct, and over the years, became a mild seasonal bug. Some people assume that will be the fate of COVID-19. However, that will likely take a long time and repeated infections and vaccinations all over the world. With the Delta variant of coronavirus spreading globally, the pandemic still has a tight grip on the world. Many people around globe are struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of the pandemic, much like a century ago with the Spanish flu. Spanish Flu: History and Defining Factors The influenza pandemic, also known as the Spanish flu, was caused by the H1N1 virus and spread across the world from 1918 to 1919. Over 500 million people were affected by this virus globally, and the death toll was around 50 million. The Second Wave was Devastating The Spanish flu was first detected in the spring of 1918, and by summer, it spread like wildfire. Although the first wave of the virus did not have a high fatality rate, it mutated during this time, and the second wave that started in August caused two-thirds of the Spanish flu deaths. The third wave of the Spanish flu hit the world near the end of 1918 and lasted until March 1919. This strain was not as deadly as the previous ones because most of the people had previously been infected with the virus and developed immunity, and many frail people had already lost their lives. Spanish Flu Did Not Originate from Spain Even though it is known as the Spanish flu, it did not originate from Spain. The name came because Spain became the first country to acknowledge the presence of a new disease spreading in the region. Spain was also one of the European countries hit hardest by the flu, which is why the name stuck. Where the Spanish flu originated from is still a mystery. There have been various theories that suggest it started in China, Britain, France or the United States. However, we cannot be sure due to the lack of information that was stored during the time. A majority of the Spanish flu deaths were among young and healthy people, which was an unusual factor. An alarming number of U.S. soldiers serving in the First World War were affected by the flu, and more soldiers died from the flu than the war. Preventive Measures Taken for Spanish Flu The preventive measures against influenza were limited to quarantine, self-isolation, disinfectants, maintaining personal hygiene, and a ban on social gatherings. The field of medicine was not advanced enough to develop vaccines and antibiotics to prevent and treat this virus efficiently. Thus, there were only limited measures people could take to protect themselves during the pandemic. Common Symptoms of the Spanish Flu The symptoms of the first wave of influenza were comparatively mild. Many people would have a fever that lasted a few days, fatigue, and chills, and they recovered. The symptoms of the second wave were more severe, with some people dying within a few hours of contracting the flu. Their skin turned blue and their lungs were filled with fluid, causing people to suffocate. In the U.S., Aspirin poisoning also became common due to the spread of influenza. At the time, doctors deemed it safe to prescribe 30 grams of Aspirin to help with the symptoms. This dose is considered fatal in today’s time. The symptoms of Aspirin poisoning included fluid build-up in the lungs, and it is assumed that this played a part in the high death toll of the Spanish flu. Since 1919, the world has seen numerous other flu pandemics, but none as deadly as the Spanish flu. Around 2 million people around the world lost their lives to the flu from 1957 to 1958. Another pandemic from 1968 to 1969 killed around a million people globally. In 2009-2010, 12,000 Americans lost their lives to the swine flu. Now, the entire world is battling coronavirus, which is considered as deadly as the Spanish flu. Societies and economies across the globe are suffering as much as they did a century ago. COVID-19: History and Defining Factors Severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle-East respiratory syndrome, and the common cold are all a part of the coronavirus family that causes COVID-19. The disease first emerged in China in 2019 and soon spread across the entire world. COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, the business hub of China, and was given the name COVID-19 by Chinese researchers. After genomically analyzing the virus, it was discovered that it resembles the SARS-like bat virus, and therefore, it’s possible the virus was contracted from bats. The Origin The first SARS-CoV was detected back in 2003 in China. The strain found in 2019 is more transmissible than the one witnessed before. In the first fifty days of its transmission, it infected over 70,000 people and took 18,000 lives in China alone. Countries like the U.S., India, Brazil, France, the U.K., and numerous others were hit hard by COVID-19. We are still in the middle of the pandemic as the virus keeps mutating, and some of the variants are more destructive than the last. How Does COVID-19 Spread? The most significant way COVID-19 transfers is through our respiratory droplets. It means if an infected person opens their mouth around anyone for any reason, they are at risk of catching the virus from them. These respiratory droplets remain in the air for minutes, and people in enclosed spaces are at a higher risk of transferring COVID-19 to others. You can also catch the virus by coming in close contact with a person already infected or touching surfaces that the virus landed on. COVID-19 enters your body through your nose and mouth. It then enters the nasal passage and begins to multiply in the mucous membrane. From there, the virus travels to the lungs and other body tissues. Common Symptoms of COVID-19 According to the CDC, there are numerous COVID-19 symptoms. The most common ones witnessed all over the world include cough, shortness of breath, fever, chills, fatigue, muscle and body aches, loss of smell or taste, congestion, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Ann Marie Kimball, a professor at the University of Washington, stated that one plus of COVID-19 is that it mutates at a slower pace than flu, which makes it easier to develop COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna will help save time while fighting any future outbreaks. When the virus started spreading, safety precautions and preventive lockdowns were quickly implemented by most countries. Social gatherings were prohibited, and people were encouraged to wear masks and always maintain a distance of at least six feet. Due to the advancements in science and medicine, we were able to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in significantly less time than the flu vaccine. The entire world has been immensely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. With millions of lives lost to the pandemic, everyone is coming to terms with the destruction caused. People in every country have lost their jobs and homes, and the poverty rates in already impoverished countries have increased. Final Takeaway COVID-19 and the Spanish flu are often compared, and both are widely known to be the deadliest pandemics our world has faced. The Spanish flu is overlooked due to the First World War, but in reality, it claimed more lives than the war. Both pandemics have caused socio-economic destruction. The economy of the U.S. has suffered a loss of around $6 trillion. The only record of an economy that suffered anything close to this in 1918-1919 was Mexico, with a loss of $9 billion. The trade activities during and after both pandemics were also hampered significantly. It is clear that the loss faced by economies during both these periods has increased the gap between the classes of society. The impact a pandemic can have on the world was visible during 1918-1919, and it was critical for us to learn from mistakes that were made during the Spanish flu. During both pandemics, we can see there have been significant delays in developing vaccines. However, the time it took to find a COVID-19 vaccine was far less due to the knowledge we have gained over the last century. The majority age group affected by the virus also differed, as the Spanish flu infected healthy and young individuals more significantly. The mechanism of death is also different for COVID-19 and the Spanish flu.

Public health measures aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19 have also reduced transmission of flu — but this is not the year to blow off your annual flu shot Published Oct 18, 2021 Updated Apr 14, 2022 1,220 words 5 minutes By Brian Owens Expand Image Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A funny thing happened last year just as the COVID-19 pandemic began sweeping across the world — the flu disappeared. What had been a fairly serious flu season in the northern hemisphere ended abruptly, while the southern hemisphere season, which usually ramps up as the northern one winds down, never really got going. “We saw flu essentially go away in our surveillance network,” says Dr. Melissa Andrew, a geriatrician and flu researcher at Dalhousie University in Halifax. “And that was true across Canada and around the world.” It’s not a coincidence — right around that time is when we started taking precautions that we know are effective against infectious diseases such as the flu: washing our hands, wearing masks, keeping our distance from other people in public and spending a lot of time alone or with just our immediate families. “Flu is a respiratory pathogen that is transmitted in many of the same ways as COVID-19, so the public health measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 played a role in reducing the rate of influenza transmission as well,” says Dr. Matthew Miller, a virologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont. As those public health measures have continued as the pandemic drags on, so too have their effects on the flu. In fact, the 2020-21 flu season essentially never happened, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. “To date this season, there has been no evidence of community circulation of influenza despite continued testing above seasonal levels. Influenza activity has remained below the threshold required to declare the start of the 2020-21 influenza season,” the agency told Canadian Geographic in April 2021 — a month that would usually mark the beginning of the end of the flu season in a normal year. Advertisement Expand Image The national health agency attributes the missing flu season to both the continuing COVID-19 precautions and the immunity offered by the seasonal flu vaccine. In the 2019-20 flu season, just 42 per cent of Canadians got a flu shot, well below the national target of 80 per cent. But in the fall of 2020, public health authorities dramatically ramped up messaging campaigns encouraging people to get the shot, emphasizing that keeping flu numbers low would be a good way to reduce pressure on health-care systems already stretched by the pandemic. While national numbers on flu vaccine uptake for the 2020-21 season will not be available until later this year, preliminary impressions suggest the campaign was effective. As of Feb. 8, 2021, New Brunswick had distributed 416,920 vaccines, its highest total ever, up from 320,380 the previous year. And in British Columbia, community pharmacists administered 1,064,769 doses of influenza vaccine in 2020-21, up from 724,256 doses in 2019-20, while physicians, nurse practitioners and registered nurses in community practices administered 259,757 doses in 2020-21, compared with just 42,374 doses in 2019-20. “Anecdotally, it seems there was a lot more interest in getting the flu vaccine this year,” says Dr. Andrew. “There were shortages in Nova Scotia because there was more uptake.” Indeed, a survey in May 2020 of 4,501 Canadians over the age of 50 found that the pandemic had significantly increased older adults’ willingness to receive the flu shot. The study, published in the journal Vaccines, was conceived by a cross-disciplinary research team from three Canadian universities. It reported that some 20 per cent of 1,001 research participants aged 50 to 64 said they had not intended to get a flu shot for the 2020-21 flu season but the COVID-19 pandemic had changed their minds. Of these respondents, 92 per cent had not been vaccinated against influenza the year before. Of the 3,500 participants aged 65 and older, eight per cent had not originally planned to get a flu shot but were now likely to receive it. While the success of flu vaccine campaigns and the low flu numbers are good news for most of us, they are making decision-making trickier for the people tasked with deciding which kinds of influenza virus to include in future versions of the vaccine. Most flu vaccines contain four different strains of flu virus. The World Health Organization monitors which strains are circulating around the world and uses that information to predict which ones are likely to be most common over the next year, so they can be put in the next season’s vaccine. But over the past year, researchers have had very little information to work with. Despite doing far more tests than usual, there was very little flu to find. “The lack of flu makes an accurate prediction of which strains to include in the vaccine very challenging,” says Dr. Miller. The WHO made its recommendation on which strains to include in the 2021-22 northern hemisphere vaccine back in February, based on what it had seen in the tiny numbers from the southern hemisphere season last summer. Just one of the four strains was changed from the previous version of the vaccine, indicating that the strains in circulation will likely be mostly the same ones that were seen before the pandemic. It’s a reasonable assumption, since the small number of infections means the viruses have not had much opportunity to mutate into new strains. But it’s also a gamble. If a new strain did arise but was missed, the vaccine may not provide as strong protection. Though vaccines for COVID-19 are now rolling out quickly, it’s likely that at least some of the public health measures to control the virus’s spread will remain for the foreseeable future. Many of those strategies, such as working remotely and wearing a mask when there’s a risk of transmission, have become more normalized and may stick around even after the pandemic has passed. That’s why Dr. Miller says, “We might still see a relatively blunted season in 2021-22.” But that doesn’t make the seasonal flu vaccine any less important. It’s unlikely that we will be completely out of the woods when it comes to COVID-19 this winter, so the rationale for getting a flu shot to help reduce the pressure on hospitals still stands. And even if the numbers of people in hospital due to COVID-19 itself are low, hospitals will still be under more strain than usual as they work through the backlog of postponed surgeries and treatments that has built up during the pandemic. “It’s a high priority to make sure we have high flu vaccine uptake to keep the pressure off hospitals,” says Dr. Miller. It’s also a high priority to build on the momentum for flu vaccines to keep more vulnerable populations safer. There is a danger that a couple of mild flu seasons could lead to a big rebound in future years as our natural population immunity slowly wanes without new infections to replenish it. But the flu is an unpredictable virus at the best of times, so there’s no telling what will happen once we wind down our pandemic precautions. “There’s a saying that if you’ve seen one flu season, you’ve seen one flu season,” says Dr. Andrew. “So there’s not much we can do but continue to protect ourselves as best we can.” Learn more about the impact of seasonal flu and test your flu knowledge with Can Geo’s digital interactive.

When the population takes numerous steps to mitigate the spread of one contagious respiratory disease, those measures work to combat the spread of most respiratory diseases.Now that many people are lowering their guard to COVID-19, health care providers are expecting more people to get sick with the flu this year than last. The 2020 flu season was an extremely low bar according to Alaska State Department of Health and Social Services data, which indicated that pubic health mitigation measures may have reduced the number of flu cases, but also found that fewer tests for the flu were likely being performed.At Alaska Regional Hospital, Infection Prevention Coordinator Jenny Mayo shared some data that shows how much COVID-19 measures lowered flu rates.“A typical flu season, when we have peaks, we might see 26-30% of patients who test for flu test positive,” Mayo said. “Last year, across the U.S., it was only 0.2% of patients tested for flu who tested positive.”In the beginning of the pandemic, orders from state and local governments forced people to put up their guards. All the masking, staying home, ordering take out, and everything else almost removed the flu from the equation last year.It’s not the same now, though. There aren’t as many requirements to stay away from each other and many people are tired of playing it safe.In Palmer, Dr. April Arseneau is an immunologist at her clinic, Valley Asthma and Allergy Clinic. She said already, she and other providers are beginning to see an increase in non-COVID related illnesses.“I think a lot of clinics are starting to see some pretty serious upper respiratory tract infections in children and last fall we just didn’t see it as much,” Arseneau said.In fact, during the summer, Arseneau pointed out that nationwide there were more cases of winter illnesses like respiratory syncytial virus being reported. However, Alaska didn’t see a spike in this disease during that time period, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Arseneau said she expects that people relaxed their guard after distribution of COVID-19 vaccines began and people started to get sick with illnesses other than COVID-19.Influenza can still send someone to the hospital. While hospitals across the state remain filled up and operating under crisis standards of care, Arseneau and Mayo said people should continue to be cautious and avoid filling up beds even more.Unlike last flu season, there is a vaccine for both the flu and COVID-19, and both Arseneau and Mayo highly encourage people to get their shots.Many people are getting their flu vaccines from Alaska Regional Hospital. On Oct. 7, the hospital hosted five community flu vaccine clinics. Alaska Regional spokespeople said 1,042 shots were administered during those clinics. There are more flu vaccination clinics at the hospital on Oct. 26 and 28.Arseneau also pointed out that people can get vaccinated for COVID-19 and the flu at the same time with two different shots. It’s more convenient, and completely safe. However, she said folks will still probably have to deal with not feeling so great for a day or so after getting them. She recently did that with her booster shot and said she wasn’t feeling good for about six hours.Although they are expecting more flu cases this year, Arseneau and Mayo aren’t expecting the numbers to go through the roof, because a lot of people are still practicing safe COVID-19 precautions.Copyright 2021 KTUU.

This comes after Chinese authorities have warned about the risk of imported COVID-19 infections due to the high incidence of respiratory infections in the winter season. A total of 19 imported COVID-19 cases and one locally transmitted infection were reported on Saturday, Xinhua reported. China's National Health Commission on Sunday said that the newly-added local case was reported in Xilin Gol League, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.Chinese health authorities stated that influenza activity in the southern and northern parts of the country since March has been higher than the same period last year.This comes in the backdrop of the risk of imported cases in China. The Global Times reported that the COVID-19 and respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza can be combined and bring a potential "twindemic" during this upcoming winter and the next spring.Ahead of the winter season, the Chinese authorities have called for strengthening monitoring and early warning mechanisms, immunizing key groups, promoting multi-disease prevention, standardizing epidemic treatment and extensive publicity and mobilization.The publication stated that last flu season clusters of flu cases occurred in schools, childcare institutions and other venues despite the overall prevalence of influenza staying relatively low.Moreover, the health authority urged the key institutions to strengthen efforts to detect, report and deal with cluster cases as early as possible.Furthermore, the Chinese authorities stressed the need to improve the convenience of influenza vaccination services and enhance procurement and deployment management of vaccines and information management of vaccination data.

Additional supplies would be requested on a needs basis.This was announced by Chief Medical Officer Dr Roshan Parasram at a conference hosted by the Ministry of Health on Wednesday.Addressing viewers and members of the media who tuned into the live-streamed event, Dr Parasram said those who should take the flu shot include children ages six months to five years; adults over the age of 65; persons suffering from noncommunicable diseases; pregnant women; persons with compromised immune systems (HIV/Lupus); persons with chronic respiratory illnesses (asthma, COPD); persons who are obese or overweight; healthcare workers; members of national security and customs and immigration.With distribution beginning on Monday, all health centres, as well as sentinel physicians, will have a supply of the flu vaccine from Thursday.However, it should be noted that people should take the influenza vaccine two weeks after completing their COVID-19 vaccine regime and vice versa. Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness and, at times, can lead to death.Similar to COVID19 and the common cold, the symptoms include:Fever or feeling feverish/chillsCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesHeadachesFatigue (tiredness)Rare cases of vomiting and diarrhoea, more common in childrenIt can easily be spread from person to person when an infected individual coughs or sneezes and droplets containing the viruses get into the air and are inhaled by others who are nearby. It can also be spread by touching contaminated surfaces and subsequently touching the mouth or nose.Members of the public are advised that new flu vaccines are released annually to keep up with rapidly adapting flu viruses and treat with the fact that people's immunity wanes over time. Last year, up to epi week 40, T&T had 830 cases and no confirmed deaths. For a similar period this year, the country has recorded 115 cases thus far.

If appointments are not available online in your area Albertans can phone their local pharmacy or doctor’s office to find out when influenza vaccinations will be available. You can also contact Health Link at 811 to book appointments. Pharmacies will be welcoming drop-ins.Albertans aged 65 and older are eligible to receive a high-dose flu vaccine while those aged six months to 64 years will receive the regular dose. Both formulations protect people from four common strains of the influenza virus.In a Friday news release, Health Minister Jason Copping says getting immunized has never been more important because Alberta hospitals are at capacity and straining to provide care for very sick people, including those with COVID-19.Advertisement 3Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content“We must do all that we can to protect ourselves, our families and our neighbours from COVID-19,” Copping said. “Getting immunized will help stop the spread of influenza, reduce flu-related visits to the emergency ward and help our health system provide care to those in need.”Recent studies and reviews have confirmed it is safe for people to receive a flu shot at the same time as their COVID-19 vaccine. Last year 37 per cent of Albertans were immunized compared to 33 per cent the year before. Alberta reported no lab-confirmed influenza cases and no flu-related deaths during the 2020/21 flu season. That compares to 8,470 confirmed cases of the virus in 2019-2020 and 41 deaths.Chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw is encouraging Albertans to do even better than last year.Advertisement 4Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content“Let’s do even better than last year when we came forward in record numbers to get our flu vaccine, washed our hands regularly, covered our sneezes and stayed home when we were sick,” she said in the news release. “And, if you haven’t already done so, consider also getting the COVID-19 vaccine. This is something each of us can do to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our health-care system that we all rely on.Last year, Alberta had zero lab-confirmed cases of influenza, while there are currently three confirmed cases this flu season. In a typical year there would be around 10 to 20 cases confirmed at this point in the flu season, said Dr. Kristin Klein, lead medical officer of health, communicable disease control with Alberta Health Services.Advertisement 5Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content“It’s a little bit less than we would typically see in an influenza season but definitely it’s some indication that we’re likely to see influenza this year,” Klein said during a Friday afternoon media availability.Klein said all three of this year’s cases have links to travel. She added that while it’s too early to say what this influenza season will look like, they can look at other countries such as Australia for some expectations.“Australia, whose influenza season happens during our summer months, continues to see low levels of influenza and hospitalizations due to influenza,” said Klein.AHS president and CEO Dr. Verna Yiu says that after more than 19 months into the pandemic response, they are encouraging Albertans to roll up their sleeves again to get immunized against influenza.“By keeping the number of influenza cases low, we can help protect at-risk Albertans and reduce the pressure on our health-care system,” Yiu said in the news release. “Now more than ever before we need to work together to protect each other and our health-care system.”The Alberta government has ordered 2.1 million doses of influenza vaccine to help protect the health of Albertans.— With files from Kellen Taniguchiapelech@postmedia.comArticle contentShare this article in your social network Share this Story : Albertans can now book flu shot appointments online Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr CommentsYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.Create an AccountSign in Join the Conversation Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Chief Medical Officer Dr Roshan Parasram stated today that Trinidad and Tobago has officially entered the influenza season, and strongly advised for persons to get vaccinated as its transmission and symptoms mirror those of the Covid-19 virus.Parasram, who was speaking during Wednesday’s virtual Covid-19 press conference, hosted by the Ministry of Health, said the influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere is usually during the months of October to May of the following year.“Trinidad and Tobago has received its first shipment of influenza vaccines for the season via the Pan American Health organisation (PAHO).”Stating that influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses, which infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs, the CMO noted that it can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death.He said the signs and symptoms, which are very similar to that of the Covid-19 virus and the common cold, include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, along with the rare cases of vomiting and diarrhoea, which are more common in children.Transmission of influenza“It is transmitted very much like Covid-19, by respiratory droplets infection. Particles are inhaled when persons sneeze or when they come in contact with a contaminated surface. So touching door knobs, desk and other surfaces and then touching one’s nose or mouth are means of transmission.“The measures we’ve put in place for Covid-19 are doing well to control both Covid-19 as well as the spread of the influenza virus.”Flu prevention measuresThe CMO stated that taking the new 2021/2022 flu vaccine is the primary means of preventing contracting the flu.“Following the Ministry of Health’s public health guideline will also help with decreasing the rate of the influenza circulation within the country. Wearing your mask, covering your mouth and mouth when you sneeze or use a tissue, wash your hands with soap and water, avoid close contact with people who have flu-like symptoms, and maintain social distances.“If you have symptoms, you seek immediate medical attention. If you experience difficulty in breathing, chest tightness, the inability to eat or drink, and persistent vomiting, or confusion, those are warning signs that you need to get to facility or seek medical care urgently,” Parasram stated.Addressing the need for taking the influenza vaccine every year, he noted that new vaccines are released every year to keep up with the rapidly adapting, rapidly changing flu viruses.“We’ve come to learn about mutations in viruses. This is common for the flu viruses, they mutate. And generally speaking the vaccine that we have this year is adapted based on the mutations that would have been found from last year’s circulating viruses.“So when you get vaccinated, your immune system produces antibodies to protect you from the viruses, including the vaccine. And antibody levels generally, as it relate to the flu vaccine, decline over time, so you get a new vaccine taken every year to ensure that you antibody level keep pace with the change in viruses that are circulating.”Parasram said the country received a quantity of vaccines from PAHO that protects against four strains of the influenza virus.“The influenza virus generally speaking, has four different sub-types; A, B, C and D. A and B are of concern to humans. D is really an animal disease for the most part, and Type C is generally very, very mild and therefore, doesn’t cause significant severe issue in the human population. So, we focus on A and B.”He said included in the vaccines two A sub-types; A/Victoria/2570/2019 IVR-215(H1N1), also known as the swine flu, and A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 IVR-224 (H3N2) or bird flu.The two Type B strains are B/Washington/02/2019 and B/Phuket/3073/2013.Target groupsParasram stated that the target population, or high risk groups, are as follows:• Children aged six months to five years of age• Adults over the age of 65• Persons suffering from non-communicable diseases (diabetes, hypertension)• Pregnant women• Persons with compromised immune system (HIV/Lupus)• Persons with chronic respiratory illness (asthma, COPD)• Persons who are obese or overweight• Healthcare workers• Members of National Security, Customs and ImmigrationHe said healthcare workers and members of national security are targeted because of their high exposure risk.Benefits of flu vaccineThe CMO said the main benefit of taking the flu vaccine is that it prevents persons from getting sick with the flu.“It does not prevent all infections but it will decrease the severity and the risk of hospitalisation, and possibly death, in persons who would have taken the vaccine.”He noted that the vaccine would also protect women both during and after pregnancy.Parasram stated that distribution of the influenza vaccine began on Monday, and has been going on throughout all Counties of the country.“The last County should pick up their vaccines today, so from tomorrow morning all health centres throughout Trinidad and Tobago will have a supply, and you’ll be able to access your influenza vaccine at any health centre, as well as the Sentinel Physicians, which are private physicians who form part of our Sentinel Physician Programme. Those would be available from early next week, hopefully from Monday.”Reiterating that the Covid-19 virus and influenza virus are similar in transmission, symptoms and treatment, Parasram said as a result it will be obviously difficult to differentiate the two, even for a trained clinical person, as the country enters the flu season.“So, we present if we have deterioration of symptoms, we will possibly be swabbed to see if it’s Covid-19 to rule it out as well. We can also test for influenza strains at the Trinidad and Tobago Public Health Lab and the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA).He advised that persons should continue practicing social distancing, wearing of face masks and washing of hands to decrease incidences of both viruses.“If you develop any of the symptoms, and you’re concerned, contact the nearest health facility as soon as possible,” Parasram noted.

During the Ministry of Health’s covid19 virtual update on Saturday morning, he said in 2018 there were 4,598 cases and seven deaths from influenza. In 2019, there were 3,854 suspected cases and 44 deaths, in 2020 there were 858 cases and no deaths, and in 2021 there were 115 cases and no deaths. He added that, 55,221; 118,015; and 75,887 people got the flu vaccine in the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021 flu seasons respectively, which runs from October to May. “Because of the health protocols of wearing masks, cleanliness and so on, we had dropped to 115 suspected cases and we had no deaths... “We were not congregating, we were masking, we were sanitising. But this year, as the coronavirus is there, the borders are now open... so people are travelling to North America and coming back here and we always follow what has happened in North America because that is one of our sources of the influenza vaccine (sic virus).” > Pulmonologist Dr Sana Mohammed explained that influenza is a contagious respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. It is most contagious three to four days after symptoms but it can be passed on before a person gets symptoms. “Influenza virus is spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or speak. These droplets then can land into the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often a person might get influenza by coming into contact with droplets on a surface that they touch and then touching their own mouth or nose.” Symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, headaches, body pains, runny or stuffy nose, vomiting and diarrhoea, and can lead to hospitalisation or death. They are similar to those of the common cold but the two are caused by different viruses. Also, influenza symptoms are more intense, begin more abruptly, and can result in serious health complications like pneumonia and bacterial infections. Vials of influenza vaccine. - File photo High-risk people include those 65 years and older, children under two years old, people with comorbidities including asthma, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), blood disorders, lung, heart, liver, and kidney diseases, the immunocompromised, the pregnant, and others. Precautionary measures to limit transmission include covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and discarding, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth, sanitising surfaces and objects, and avoiding close contact with sick people. “All these public health measures should be second nature to us during this covid pandemic... “The best way to avoid getting flu is to have your annual flu shots. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and our Ministry of Health recommends that all persons over the age of six months have their annual flu shots. The vaccination has also been shown to decrease the severity of flu, to decrease hospitalisation, and in the case of children, to decrease the risk of flu-related death.” Deyalsingh said through PAHO, TT has a quadrivalent vaccine which covers two influenza A and two influenza B strains. These vaccines are available at all health centres. > He encouraged all to get their flu shots, especially high-risk people, as well as frontline workers to keep the number of deaths from influenza at zero. He added that, while the World Health Organization allows for the administration of the flu and covid19 vaccines at the same time, the ministry recommends people get their flu shots two weeks before or after getting the covid19 vaccine. Also, those 60 years and over with NCDs can get their flu shots at the National Care Fair on October 29 and 30.

Vaccinations, given via a quick, safe and painless nasal spray, will be offered to all primary and secondary aged children in local schools over the coming weeks. Free copies of this year's exciting Flu Fighters storybook, Flu Fighters On A Vacc-tastic Voyage, are being given to all primary school children a few weeks before the vaccination is due in their school. All primary and secondary pupils will also a receive parental consent form, and parents and guardians are asked to complete and return these as soon as possible. Among the first schools in the city to be visited by nurses from Vaccination UK this year was Whitgreave Primary School. Headteacher Sarah Redfern said: "As a school, we are very pleased to be supporting the Flu Fighters campaign again this year. "It is very important that our young people are protected against the flu as we enter the winter period. The campaign is very well organised and a positive move in the current climate, with coronavirus still very much with us." Nurses have also been to Long Knowle Primary School this week. Headteacher Karen Elliot said: "At Long Knowle we are very keen for as many children as possible to have their flu vaccination. "It’s important in any year that children can stay well so that they can be in school to make the most of all their learning opportunities. Over the last 20 months, a lot of time has been missed because of the Covid pandemic – so it’s even more important this year that children have their flu vaccine, to look after themselves, their families and the whole school community. "The children have loved this year's Flu Fighters book and we are very pleased with the high numbers of parents at Long Knowle who have allowed their children to take the opportunity to be vaccinated." Councillor Jasbir Jaspal, the City of Wolverhampton Council’s Cabinet Member for Public Health and Wellbeing, said: "I am delighted to see that the annual flu vaccination programme is going so well in our schools and will be helping to protect thousands of children and their families from this particularly nasty winter virus. "The vaccine is safe and has been given to millions of children around the world, and youngsters needn't worry about any nasty needles, either, because the vaccine is delivered via a quick squirt up the nose. "Please return your completed consent forms as soon as possible to ensure your child doesn't miss out." All primary and secondary aged children will be offered the nasal spray through their school. Vaccination via the nasal spray is also available to children aged 2 and 3, and children with some long term health conditions, through their GP, and parents and carers have been contacted by the NHS about this.
