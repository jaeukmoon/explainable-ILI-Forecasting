1. Cellular immune responses, specifically diverse and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, circulating T follicular helper cells, T helper type 17 cells, myeloid dendritic cells, and CD16+ natural killer cells, play a role in protecting against symptomatic influenza virus infection.
2. Nonspecific inflammatory populations, including γδ T cells, activated CD16− natural killer cells, and TNFα+ single-cytokine-producing CD8+ T cells, are associated with increased susceptibility to symptomatic influenza.
3. Baseline variations in cellular and humoral immune compartments independently contribute to the risk of developing symptomatic influenza.
4. Cellular subsets work synergistically with humoral immunity to confer protection against symptomatic influenza.
5. Identification of specific cellular subsets can improve the prediction of symptomatic influenza susceptibility over vaccination, demographics, or serology alone.
