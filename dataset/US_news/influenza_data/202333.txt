However, few studies have resolved the contribution of cellular responses within the context of preexisting antibody titers. Here, we measured the peripheral immune profiles of 206 vaccinated or unvaccinated adults to determine how baseline variations in the cellular and humoral immune compartments contribute independently or synergistically to the risk of developing symptomatic influenza. Protection correlated with diverse and polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T, circulating T follicular helper, T helper type 17, myeloid dendritic and CD16+ natural killer (NK) cell subsets. Conversely, increased susceptibility was predominantly attributed to nonspecific inflammatory populations, including γδ T cells and activated CD16− NK cells, as well as TNFα+ single-cytokine-producing CD8+ T cells. Multivariate and predictive modeling indicated that cellular subsets (1) work synergistically with humoral immunity to confer protection, (2) improve model performance over demographic and serologic factors alone and (3) comprise the most important predictive covariates. Together, these results demonstrate that preinfection peripheral cell composition improves the prediction of symptomatic influenza susceptibility over vaccination, demographics or serology alone.

Univariate analyses, including Fisher’s exact test, Kruskal-Wallis, logistic regression, and ROC thresholds were performed first on single, independent variables. These analyses help determine if an individual immune measure is statistically different between influenza virus infection and vaccination comparator groups (Fisher’s exact test; Kruskal-Wallis), the risk of symptomatic influenza associated with an individual measure (logistic regression), and the threshold at which an individual immune measure can accurately describe 50% of symptomatic cases (ROC threshold). As univariate comparisons do not account for confounding factors, multivariate analyses were performed on combined variables including decision tree analysis (random forest) and logistic regression. The random forest allows comparison of performance (that is categorization accuracy) across models (ROC; Sensitivity & Specificity) as well as the relative importance of individual covariates within a model (VIP analyses). While random forest considers which models or individual covariates best categorize cases (symptomatic influenza) and controls (uninfected/cryptic), they do not provide information on association or risk. Multivariate generalized linear modeling (GLM) was used to determine the risk of symptomatic influenza associated with individual immune measures while accounting for the effects of others. The GLM was built on a select set of variables determined following reduction of dimensionality (correlation-based clustering) and multicollinearity (VIF) using stepwise regression (Akaike Information Criteria; AIC) and evaluated using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA).Extended Data Fig. 2 Participant demographic and serologic correlations.a) Spearman Rank correlations between serology measures.

Our team is easy to reach and delivers treatments that speed healing. Medically reviewed by Dean Blumberg, M.D. on Aug. 18, 2023. UC Davis HealthPatients and VisitorsConditions and Treatments Infectious Diseases Viral Infections Influenza (Flu) What Is the Flu? The flu is a viral infection that is highly contagious and typically strikes in the fall and winter. There are two main types. Influenza A is more common and can cause severe symptoms. Type B is rarer and more likely late in the season, like February and March. At UC Davis Health, you receive prompt influenza care close to home. Many primary care provider locations offer same- and next-day appointments for flu symptoms. Our telehealth express care service makes it possible to receive some services from home. You may still need to come to a lab for testing to confirm the diagnosis. On this page chevron_left SymptomsCauses & Risk FactorsDiagnosis & TestingTreatmentsPreventionAppointments chevron_right settings_accessibility Flu Symptoms The influenza virus affects your nose and throat. Occasionally, it impacts your lungs. In some people, it causes discomfort lasting a few days. Sometimes flu symptoms make people very sick, requiring immediate care in the hospital. Common Flu Symptoms The symptoms you experience depend on where the infection spreads and its severity. Cough Diarrhea Fever and chills Head- and body aches Sore throat Tiredness Vomiting Emergency Influenza Symptoms Severe symptoms or ones that do not improve in a few days require prompt medical attention. Chest pain and difficulty breathing Dehydration from frequent vomiting or diarrhea Lightheadedness Skin or lips turning blue list_alt Causes and Risk Factors of the Flu Influenza happens when you get infected with the flu virus. After exposure, it may take a few days for you to start feeling sick. There are some risk factors that can slightly increase your chances of getting influenza. Age Young children and older adults are more likely to develop severe flu that may require hospital care. Other Medical Issues You face a higher risk if you have a weakened immune system or ongoing medical issues like diabetes. Vaccination Status If you have not received your annual flu shot, you have little natural defense against it. troubleshoot Diagnosis and Testing for Flu If you have flu-like symptoms, seeing a provider promptly is essential. We can confirm the diagnosis and flu type using a quick lab test. This information helps you start treatments, like antiviral medications, earlier when they’re more likely to be effective. Flu Treatments The treatment that’s best for you depends on the flu type and severity. Antiviral Medications These medications fight the flu virus, helping you recover in less time. Antiviral drugs also lower the likelihood of flu-related complications. Home Remedies Rest is essential when you are trying to recover from the flu. It is also important to get a lot of fluids so you don’t get dehydrated. Symptom Relievers Additional medications can improve specific symptoms. Saline nasal spray reduces sinus pressure, making it easier to breathe. Ibuprofen helps treat body aches. Professional Guidance Your provider will give you information about flu-related complications and what to do if you think you have one. Additional treatments may be necessary if you have a high fever that doesn’t go away, chest pain or faintness. shield_with_heart Preventing the Flu While influenza can be highly contagious, taking certain precautions significantly lowers your risk of infection. Vaccination One of the best ways to prevent the flu is by getting an annual flu shot. Hygiene You can also avoid contact with people who are sick. If you must share space with an infected person, regularly wash your hands and disinfect high-touch surfaces like doorknobs. Face Masks Respirator masks such as N95s can prevent you from inhaling the influenza virus. A well-fitted face mask can provide an extra layer of protection in crowded public areas like airports. add "Assessment of a respiratory face mask for capturing air pollutants and pathogens including human influenza and rhinoviruses," Journal of Thoracic Disease, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5906272/ Average number of hospitalizations 200K+Each year in the U.S. Flu shot impact 40-60%Less likely to need to go to the doctor if you get the shot Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Frequently Asked Questions about Estimated Flu Burden CDC: Vaccine Effectiveness: How Well Do Flu Vaccines Work?

[1, 2] Transmission of swine influenza viruses to humans is uncommon. However, the swine influenza virus can be transmitted to humans via contact with infected pigs or environments contaminated with swine influenza viruses. [3] Swine influenza virus. Colorized transmission electron micrograph (37,800X) of the A/New Jersey/76 (Hsw1N1) virus under plate magnification. Image taken during the virus' first developmental passage through a chicken egg. Courtesy of the CDC/Dr. E. Palmer; R.E. Bates. View Media Gallery Signs and symptoms Manifestations of H1N1 influenza are similar to those of seasonal influenza. Patients present with symptoms of acute respiratory illness, including at least two of the following: Fever Cough Sore throat Body aches Headache Chills and fatigue Diarrhea and vomiting (possible) In children, signs of severe disease include apnea, tachypnea, dyspnea, cyanosis, dehydration, altered mental status, and extreme irritability. [4] See Clinical Presentation for more detail. Diagnosis The CDC criteria for suspected H1N1 influenza are as follows [5] : Onset of acute febrile respiratory illness within 7 days of close contact with a person who has a confirmed case of H1N1 influenza A virus infection, or Onset of acute febrile respiratory illness within 7 days of travel to a community (within the United States or internationally) where one or more H1N1 influenza A cases have been confirmed, or Acute febrile respiratory illness in a person who resides in a community where at least one H1N1 influenza case has been confirmed. See Workup for more detail. Management Treatment largely is supportive and consists of bedrest, increased fluid consumption, cough suppressants, and antipyretics and analgesics (eg, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for fever and myalgias. Severe cases may require intravenous hydration and other supportive measures. Antiviral agents may also be considered for treatment or prophylaxis. See Treatment and Medication for more detail. Next: Background Swine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease in pigs caused by one of several swine influenza A viruses, as recently reviewed. [1, 2] In addition, influenza C viruses may also cause illness in swine. Strategies to control swine influenza virus (SIV) in animals typically include one of several commercially available bivalent swine influenza virus vaccines. Transmission of swine influenza viruses to humans is uncommon. However, the swine influenza virus can be transmitted to humans via contact with infected pigs or environments contaminated with swine influenza viruses. Once a human becomes infected, he or she then can spread the virus to other humans, presumably in the same way as seasonal influenza is spread (ie, via coughing or sneezing). History The ability to trace outbreaks of swine flu in humans dates back to investigation of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, which infected one third of the world’s population (an estimated 500 million people) and caused approximately 50 million deaths. In 1918, the cause of human influenza and its links to avian and swine influenza was not understood. The answers did not begin to emerge until the 1930s, when related influenza viruses (now known as H1N1 viruses) were isolated from pigs and then humans. [6] In humans, the severity of swine influenza can vary from mild to severe. From 2005 until January 2009, 12 human cases of swine flu were reported in the United States; none were fatal. In 1988, however, a previously healthy 32-year-old pregnant woman in Wisconsin died of pneumonia as a complication of swine influenza. A 1976 outbreak of swine influenza in Fort Dix, New Jersey, involved more than 200 cases, some of them severe, and one death. [7] The first discovered case involved a soldier at Fort Dix who complained of feeling weak and tired. He died the next day. The fear of an influenza pandemic in 1976 led to a national campaign in the United States designed to immunize nearly the entire population. In October 1976, approximately 40 million people received the A/NewJersey/1976/H1N1 vaccine (ie, swine flu vaccine) before the immunization initiative was halted because of the strong association between the vaccine and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). [8, 9] About 500 cases of GBS were reported, with 25 deaths due to associated pulmonary complications. [10] A recent investigation sought to determine the link between GBS and the 1976 swine flu vaccine, because subsequent influenza vaccines did not have this strong association. Nachamkin et al found that inoculation of the 1976 swine flu vaccine, as well as the 1991-1992 and 2004-2005 influenza vaccines, into mice prompted production of antibodies to antiganglioside (anti-GM1), which are associated with the development of GBS. They proposed that further research regarding influenza vaccine components is warranted to determine how these components elicit antiganglioside effects.

Goldsmith and A. Balish. View Media Gallery 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza (formerly called swine influenza) outbreak Human cases of influenza A (H1N1) were reported worldwide. In 2009, cases of influenzalike illness were first reported in Mexico on March 18; the outbreak was subsequently confirmed as H1N1 influenza A. [12] Suspected clinical cases had been reported in 19 of the country's 32 states, although only 97 of the Mexican cases had been laboratory-confirmed as influenza A/H1N1 [13] (12 of them genetically identical to influenza A/H1N1 viruses from California. [12] ) As of May 5th, 2009, nearly 600 H1N1 influenza cases had been confirmed in Mexico, including 25 deaths. [14] On April 17, 2009, the CDC determined that 2 cases of febrile respiratory illness in children who resided in adjacent counties in southern California were caused by infection with a swine influenza A (H1N1) virus. [15] By April 26, 2009, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a national public health emergency involving H1N1 influenza A, citing its significant potential to affect national security. [16] By June 25, 2009, 27,717 lab-defined cases of H1N1 influenza had been confirmed in the United States. [13, 17, 18, 19] Estimates in the United States for the first 6 months of the pandemic reported approximately 22 million people in the United States became ill from the H1N1 influenza, nearly 100,000 were hospitalized, and about 3900 died. Deaths include an estimated 540 children younger than 18 years, 2900 adults aged 18-64 years, and about 440 elderly individuals. These estimates are from the CDC's Emerging Infection Program, rather than using only laboratory-confirmed cases. [20] For an updated tally and case counts in specific states, see the CDC's H1N1 Flu (Swine Flu) Web page. On June 11, 2009, the WHO raised the pandemic alert level to phase 6 (indicating a global pandemic) because of widespread infection beyond North America to Australia, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile, Spain, and Japan. [13] As of September 1, 2009, the WHO reported that H1N1 influenza had been confirmed in over 200,000 people in more than 100 countries and that they were aware of at least 2185 confirmed deaths. For an updated tally of affected countries and counts, see WHO's Influenza A (H1N1) Web page. On October 24, 2009, President Obama declared the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic a national emergency, explaining that "...the rapid increase in illness across the Nation may overburden health care resources and that the temporary waiver of certain standard Federal requirements may be warranted in order to enable U.S. health care facilities to implement emergency operations plans, the in the United States 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic constitutes a national emergency." This declaration made way for waiving certain requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance programs and of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule throughout the duration of the public health emergency. [21] Government and public health officials are monitoring this situation worldwide to assess the threat from H1N1 influenza and to provide guidance to health care professionals and the public. Because the situation is changing rapidly, it is important to check regularly for changes in recommendations as new information becomes available. Online resources for daily guidance include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and Medscape's H1N1 Influenza A (Swine Flu) Alert Center. Domínguez-Cherit et al (2009) conducted an observational study of consecutive critically ill patients in Mexican hospitals that treated most patients with confirmed, probable, or suspected H1N1 influenza during the 2009 epidemic. Critical illness occurred in 58 (6.5%) of 899 patients. The median age of critically ill patients was 44 years (range, 10-83 y). All presented with fever, and all but one with respiratory symptoms. Few patients had comorbid respiratory disorders, but 36% were obese. All patients but 2 received mechanical ventilation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and refractory hypoxemia. By 60 days, 24 patients had died (41.4%). Patients who died had greater initial severity of illness, worse hypoxemia, higher creatine kinase and creatinine levels, and ongoing organ dysfunction. Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors was associated with improved survival (odds ratio, 8.5). [22] See Medscape's H1N1 influenza algorithm adaptation for guidance in managing suspected cases. A WHO report on the 2009 influenza pandemic indicated that nearly all countries reported cases of H1N1 virus infection, with more than 17,000 deaths worldwide. In the United States, the number of clinical illnesses was estimated at 59 million, 265,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 deaths. [23] H1N1 strains are still prevalent in India, whose Health Ministry has reported over 2500 deaths to date. In the second half of 2011, a novel swine influenza virus emerged. Twelve cases from 5 states were reported by the CDC in January 2012. The new strain, dubbed A (H3N2)v, includes a gene from the human pandemic strain and affects mostly children. In 3 of the 5 states where the virus emerged (Pennsylvania, Maine, and Indiana), the virus was a result of pig-to-human transmission. [24] Previous Next: Epidemiology Mortality/Morbidity H1N1 influenza (swine flu) tends to cause high morbidity but low mortality rates (1%-4%). Age Belongia et al provide an excellent epidemiologic comparison of the clinical characteristics of the 2009 influenza A H1N1 versus other seasonal influenza A strains. [25] In their study, the clinical manifestations and risk for hospitalization were similar between the 2009 H1N1 strain and other seasonal influenza A strains. However, children were disproportionately affected by the 2009 H1N1 strain but not necessarily by severity of illness. Previous Next: Prognosis A review of medical records from the 2009 US pandemic found hospitalized patients with pandemic H1N1 and pneumonia were at risk for severe outcomes including ARDS, sepsis, and death. However, patients often received delayed antiviral treatment (>2 days after illness onset). Patients with H1N1 and pneumonia should receive early and aggressive treatment with antibiotics and influenza antiviral agents. [26] In a multicenter study in Britain consisting of over 1500 patients, independent predictors of severe outcome included age 55 to 64 years, certain chronic lung diseases, underlying neurological disease, obesity, delayed admission (≥5 days after illness onset), pneumonia, and others.

However, you can significantly lower your risk and prevent illness by getting a flu shot early in the season (October). Seasonal flu is highly contagious, often spreading before an infected person recognizes symptoms like a sore throat, cough, congestion, and body aches. Seeking antiviral flu treatment within a few days of symptoms can shorten your illness. Roos Koole / Getty Images Flu Symptoms Flu symptoms can vary from person to person. For example, some people will develop a fever with the flu, while others will not. Your symptoms can be mild to severe, depending on your age, overall health, and the strain of the virus. The most common flu symptoms include: Fever Chills Body aches Sore throat Cough Headaches Fatigue Congestion Runny nose Digestive symptoms, like vomiting and diarrhea, are more likely to occur among children than adults with the flu. Warning Signs You Need Medical Care These symptoms are warning signs that your respiratory infection needs immediate medical care: Difficulty breathing (shortness of breath, fast breathing, ribs pulling in with each breath)Bluish lips or faceChest painAbdominal painSevere muscle painSevere weaknessConfusionDizzinessSeizuresDehydration (not urinating for eight hours, dry mouth)Any fever in children younger than three monthsFever above 104 degrees FahrenheitWorsening of chronic medical conditions Flu vs. Cold vs. COVID-19 The flu, colds, and COVID-19 are all caused by viruses that can result in respiratory symptoms. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, it can be challenging to determine which one you have without taking a test. The table below outlines the main differences between the flu, cold, and COVID-19 symptoms. Flu vs. Cold vs. COVID-19 Symptoms Symptoms Flu Cold COVID-19 Headache Common Rare Common Sore throat Common Common Common Runny nose Common Common Common Muscle aches Common Sometimes Common Diarrhea Sometimes (mostly kids) No Sometimes Cough Common Common Common (usually dry) Nausea, vomiting Sometimes (mostly kids) No Sometimes Loss of sense of smell or taste Rare Sometimes (with congestion) Common (without congestion) Tiredness Common Sometimes Common Fever Common Sometimes Common Shortness of breath Common Rare Common Sneezing Rare Common Rare What Causes the Flu? The flu is a respiratory infection caused by two viruses, influenza A and influenza B. The viruses pass between humans and, in some cases, from animals to humans. The viruses can spread fast across the globe, especially flu A. Flu A vs Flu B Though there are four flu viruses—A, B, C, and D—but influenza A and B are the two primarily affecting people. Influenza C only causes mild infections in people, and influenza D primarily affects cattle. Only influenzas A and B are known to cause flu pandemics and regularly cause seasonal epidemics every winter. Influenza A and B are treated the same way and can have similar symptoms, but they have some differences in how they affect people. Flu A is more common, responsible for approximately 75% of all flu cases experienced yearly. This is likely because it mutates (changes) quickly, allowing it to transfer from animals and birds to humans, and then between people. Frequent viral mutation also means that new vaccines are needed every year to keep up with new flu A strains. Influenza A is the only type of flu that causes pandemics. It can affect adults and children but tends to be more severe in adults. Flu B only affects humans and, more commonly, infects children. While it usually has mild symptoms, it can have more severe effects on kids under age 5. How the Flu Spreads Influenza A and B are transmitted (spread) when someone with the virus sneezes or coughs, sending tiny virus-containing droplets into the air. Anyone nearby who inhales the droplets and takes in the virus can get sick. The virus can also live for a time on surfaces. If one person sneezes or coughs the droplets may land on a surface. Or, a person with a flu infection may sneeze into their hand, and then touch an object. In both cases, the virus spreads to people who touch the area before the virus dies. When Is Flu Season? Flu season runs from October through May. However, cases typically peak between December and March, with the most illnesses frequently reported in February. Though flu viruses circulate all year long, flu season occurs in the fall and winter because of cooler temperatures. In colder months, the influenza viruses thrive longer, natural defenses are down, and transmission between people increases. Complications and Risks Most people will recover from the flu within a few days to two weeks. Unfortunately, some people develop flu complications, which can become life-threatening. Flu often causes ear and sinus infections. Some people develop serious health complications, such as pneumonia (a lung infection), and heart inflammation (myocarditis). Though rare, flu may also cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or muscles (myositis). In some cases, a flu infection can lead to multi-organ failure or an extreme whole-body inflammatory response called sepsis. If you have a chronic health condition, the flu can make your symptoms worsen. For instance, the flu can lead to more severe asthma attacks among people who already have this respiratory condition. Your risk of developing complications is higher if you: Are 65 and older Are younger than 5 years old Are pregnant Have asthma, COPD, or any chronic lung condition Have kidney, liver, blood vessel, heart or neurological disease Have a condition making it difficult to swallow or cough Have a blood disorder, such as sickle cell disease Have a weakened immune system Are under 19 years old and taking aspirin regularly Are living in a long-term care facility Are obese How Is the Flu Diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will ask about your symptoms and how long you've been sick. They'll also look in your ears, nose, and throat and listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. If flu activity is high in your area and your symptoms point to influenza, your healthcare provider may diagnose and treat you based on your physical assessment and after eliminating other reasons for your symptoms. Your provider may also perform a flu test to determine if your symptoms are definitely due to the influenza virus. The flu test is especially useful when flu activity is low in your area but your healthcare provider still thinks you might have it. An in-office rapid influenza test takes about 15 minutes to get results. The test typically involves a nasal or throat swab to determine whether you have the flu virus. Flu Treatment If you become sick with the flu virus, there are some measures you can take to help speed up your recovery as you ride the illness out. Antiviral medications may help reduce the duration of symptoms and prevent flu complications if you start taking them within the first few days of symptoms. Visit your healthcare provider as soon as symptoms begin to get a prescription. Otherwise, the best thing for you to do if you have the flu is to stay home and rest. Avoid contact with others unless you require medical care. If you're in a high-risk group or develop warning signs, seek medical attention immediately. Try to stay isolated (away from other people) until you are fever-free and without other symptoms for 24 hours. If you need to be around others, wear a mask to help prevent the spread of germs. Self-Care For Flu If you are home resting with the flu, stay hydrated with fluids like water, juice, herbal tea, popsicles, broth, or electrolyte drinks. Make a warm saltwater mix to gargle and soothe a sore throat. If you're congested, it may help to keep a humidifier going by your bed at night. How Long Does the Flu Last? For most healthy people, symptoms of the flu go through stages, subsiding within a few days to two weeks. For people who are in a high-risk group or have other existing medical conditions, the flu may take longer to heal. How Long Is the Flu Contagious? If you pick up the flu virus, you can give it to someone else one day before your symptoms begin and up to seven days after they improve. The most contagious period is the first three to four days after you start feeling sick. Prevention The most effective way to prevent flu is getting an annual flu shot. While the most prominent circulating flu virus strains change yearly, scientists do their best to predict which ones will be the most contagious using research. Annual vaccines are designed around these data. Regardless, all flu vaccines in the United States protect you against three different flu viruses. These include an influenza A (H1N1) virus, an influenza A (H3N2) virus, and an influenza B virus. Flu shots work by causing your body to produce antibodies within two weeks of receiving the shot. These antibodies fight off the flu virus after you're exposed. A healthcare provider can answer any questions about the flu shot and determine which one is best for you, especially if you are over 65. Older individuals are at a higher risk for complications from the flu. They should receive a higher dose or an adjuvanted flu vaccine that contains an ingredient to produce a better immune response. The best time to get your flu shot is in September or October, so your body has time to prepare antibodies before peak flu season arrives. Annual flu shots are available at many pharmacies, grocery stores, and primary care offices. How Effective Are Flu Vaccines? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts annual studies to determine how effective the flu vaccine is each year. The most recent data suggests a 40% to 60% lower risk of getting the flu among people who get their annual flu shot. One of the most significant factors in its effectiveness is how well-matched the vaccine is with the most prevalent virus strains each year. Summary The flu virus causes mild to severe symptoms that usually appear suddenly. The most common flu symptoms include fever, body aches, fatigue, sore throat, cough, headache, congestion, and a runny nose. Symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, and severe weakness are signs of a developing complication that needs immediate medical attention. Your healthcare provider can prescribe antiviral medication to help you feel better faster. However, you must see your provider in the first few days after your symptoms appear. Other than antiviral medication, the only flu treatment is self-care. You should rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms. 15 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

How IAV disrupts host defense to promote SA infection in lung alveoli, where fatal lung injury occurs, is not known. We addressed this issue using real-time determinations of alveolar responses to IAV in live, intact, perfused lungs. Our findings show that IAV infection blocked defensive alveolar wall liquid (AWL) secretion and induced airspace liquid absorption, thereby reversing normal alveolar liquid dynamics and inhibiting alveolar clearance of inhaled SA. Loss of AWL secretion resulted from inhibition of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel in the alveolar epithelium, and airspace liquid absorption was caused by stimulation of the alveolar epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Loss of AWL secretion promoted alveolar stabilization of inhaled SA, but rescue of AWL secretion protected against alveolar SA stabilization and fatal SA-induced lung injury in IAV-infected mice. These findings reveal a central role for AWL secretion in alveolar defense against inhaled SA and identify AWL inhibition as a critical mechanism of IAV lung pathogenesis. AWL rescue may represent a new therapeutic approach for IAV-SA coinfection. Graphical Abstract Introduction Lung infection is the fourth leading cause of global mortality (1), and the majority of severe lung infections are caused by respiratory viruses (2, 3). Among virus-infected individuals, the highest rates of death occur in those who acquire secondary lung infection by inhaled bacteria (4–9). Factors that account for the virulence of viral-bacterial coinfection remain unclear. Since coinfection pathogenesis centers on acute lung injury (10, 11), a disease of lung alveoli (12, 13), coinfection virulence might result from virus-induced alveolar responses that render alveoli susceptible to bacterial colonization and toxicity. However, there is little understanding as to how alveoli respond to respiratory viruses, including those responses that promote secondary bacterial infection. Here, we consider these issues in the context of lung coinfection by influenza A virus (IAV) and Staphylococcus aureus (SA), a common and lethal (4–7) pathogen combination for which current therapy is insufficiently effective (14) and increasingly hindered by pathogen drug resistance (15, 16). Known mechanisms by which IAV promotes secondary SA infection focus on non-alveolar aspects of the respiratory system: airways, microvessels, and immune cells. Thus, SA inhaled into IAV-infected lungs encounter IAV-induced airway epithelial changes that promote bacterial adherence, including cell loss that exposes bacterial attachment sites (17) and impaired mucociliary velocity that hampers bacterial clearance (18). Survival of inhaled SA is enhanced by IAV-induced immune cell dysfunction that impairs bacterial uptake and killing (19, 20). Subsequently, SA cause acute lung injury by inducing exuberant inflammatory cell recruitment (21, 22), innate immune cell necrosis (23), and microvascular endothelial barrier dysfunction (24). Although these mechanisms address major aspects of coinfection pathogenesis, they do not address how IAV promotes SA infection in alveoli. This knowledge gap is important because alveoli comprise more than 95% of the lung surface area (25, 26) and are the site of the epithelial barrier dysfunction that drives fatal SA-induced lung injury (27). IAV might promote SA infection in alveoli by disrupting alveolar defense. Alveolar defense mechanisms include bacterial killing by surfactants and alveolar macrophages (28–30) and particle removal by alveolar wall liquid (AWL) flow (31). AWL flow is generated on the alveolar surface by epithelial AWL secretion and convectively transports particles (31) — and perhaps SA (27) — out of alveoli. Since AWL secretion depends on function of the alveolar epithelial cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein (31), an ion channel inhibited by IAV in vitro (32–34), we considered that IAV might promote alveolar SA infection by blocking defensive, CFTR-dependent AWL secretion. We tested this hypothesis by carrying out what we believe to be the first determinations of alveolar responses to IAV lung infection in live, intact, perfused lungs. Our findings show that IAV did indeed block AWL secretion by CFTR inhibition. However, IAV also caused airspace liquid absorption through activation of the alveolar epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). The outcome was a remarkable reversal of normal alveolar liquid dynamics that abrogated AWL secretion, thereby promoting the alveolar stabilization of inhaled SA. Rescue of AWL secretion in IAV-infected mice restored alveolar SA clearance and protected against SA-induced lung injury. These findings show, for the first time to our knowledge, that AWL secretion contributes critically to lung defense against SA. Its restoration in IAV-infected lungs may represent a new therapeutic approach for the prevention of fatal SA coinfection. Results IAV lung infection blocks AWL secretion and induces alveolar liquid absorption. We used our established methods (27) to view live alveoli of intact, perfused mouse lungs by real-time confocal microscopy. Mice were untreated or intranasally instilled with IAV or SA at 24 hours and 4 hours, respectively, prior to lung excision for imaging. We determined epithelial viability by microinstillation of calcein dye into alveolar airspaces, then defined barrier function by addition of fluorophore-labeled dextran (20 kDa) to the lung perfusate solution. In IAV-infected lungs, cytosolic calcein fluorescence (Figure 1A) indicates that the alveolar epithelium was viable, and confinement of dextran fluorescence to microvessels of calcein-loaded alveoli (Figure 1, B and C) signals that barrier function was intact. Although the epithelium was also viable in SA-infected lungs (Figure 1D), dextran leak into airspaces (Figure 1, E and F) indicates that barrier dysfunction caused edema formation, aligning with our published data (27). We conclude that the alveolar epithelium retained viability and barrier function at 24 hours after IAV infection. Figure 1Alveolar epithelial viability and barrier function in live, intact, perfused lungs. (A–F) Confocal images show epithelial fluorescence of calcein (magenta) and intravascular (i.v.) fluorescence of tetramethylrhodamine-labeled dextran (20 kDa; 10 mg/mL; cyan) in live alveoli of intact, blood-perfused mouse lungs. Lungs were excised for imaging at 24 hours after intranasal (i.n.) IAV instillation (A–C) or 4 hours after intranasal SA instillation (D–F). Calcein-AM was microinstilled in alveoli by alveolar micropuncture, and dextran was added to the lung perfusate solution. Example dextran-filled airspaces are indicated by asterisks (E and F). Note that dextran fluorescence fills numerous alveolar airspaces (alv) in the SA-infected lung (E and F) but is absent from airspaces in the IAV-infected lung (B and C). Bacteria are not shown. Scale bars: 50 μm. Each set of images was replicated in lungs of 3 mice. To visualize the AWL, we used an established approach (27, 31) in which we perfused the lungs with non-fluorescent blood-buffer solution, then micropunctured single alveoli under bright-field microscopy to instill alveolar airspaces with a 2-second microinfusion of fluorophore-labeled dextran (70 kDa) in aqueous solution. The microinfusion spread to airspaces of at least 20 neighboring alveoli, as evidenced by transient loss of optical discrimination between alveolar walls and airspaces. Return of optical discrimination occurred within seconds of each microinstillation, indicating that free fluid rapidly drained from alveoli and reestablished the air-filled alveolar lumens (35). In line with published findings from our group (31), confocal imaging revealed dextran fluorescence in airspaces as a juxtaepithelial layer that accumulated at alveolar niches (Figure 2A, arrowheads), curved regions of alveolar walls where septa converge (27). Airspace washout by alveolar microinfusion of non-fluorescent buffer abolished the dextran fluorescence (data not shown), indicating that dextran was restricted to airspaces and not taken up by the alveolar wall. Figure 2IAV lung infection disrupts AWL secretion in live alveoli. (A) Low-power (inset) and high-power confocal images show fluorescence of tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated (TRITC-conjugated) dextran (70 kDa; 10 mg/mL; yellow) in live alveoli (magenta) at 10 minutes after alveolar dextran microinstillation. Note that dextran formed a thin layer against alveolar walls and pooled in structural alveolar niches (arrowheads). CR, calcein red-orange; alv, alveolar airspace. Scale bars: 50 (inset) and 20 μm. Images replicated in 40 mice. (B–E) Confocal images (B–D) and group data (E) show time-dependent change of alveolar dextran fluorescence in airspaces of live alveoli in lungs excised from mice that were untreated (B–D), top row, and E, filled circles; n = 4 mice) or intranasally instilled with IAV at 24 hours before imaging (B–D, bottom row, and E, open circles; n = 4 mice). Fluorescence of alveolar walls is not shown. Group data (E) represent mean ± SEM. For each mouse, mean dextran fluorescence was quantified at each of the 3 indicated time points in an imaging field containing at least 30 lung alveoli. *P < 0.05 vs. closed circles by 2-tailed t test. Scale bars: 50 μm. Calibration experiments in glass micropipettes showed that dextran fluorescence varied with dextran concentration (Supplemental Figure 1, A and B; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI163402DS1) and was unchanged after repeated imaging (data not shown). However, dextran fluorescence decreased over time in alveolar airspaces of unchallenged lungs (Figure 2, B–D, top row, and Figure 2E, filled circles), confirming published findings (31) and indicating that the dextran was progressively diluted by addition of non-fluorescent liquid. To determine whether the dilution resulted from airspace accumulation of airway liquid, we inferred time-dependent change of airspace dextran volume from quantifications of dextran pool width at alveolar niches in high-power images at a specific distance below the pleura (Figure 3, A–E). Our findings confirm our group’s published data (31) and show that airspace and dextran pool widths were steady in alveoli of unchallenged lungs (Figure 3E, first and second bars, respectively), indicating that there was no inflow of liquid from the airways during the period of dextran fluorescence loss. Hence, we interpret that airspace dextran dilution resulted from alveolar liquid secretion, confirming reports (31) that the alveolar epithelium continuously secretes AWL into alveolar airspaces under baseline conditions. Figure 3IAV lung infection induces airspace liquid absorption in live alveoli. (A–E) Confocal images (A–D) and group data (E) show time-dependent change of fluorescence of microinstilled TRITC-conjugated dextran (70 kDa; 10 mg/mL; yellow) in the live alveolus (magenta) shown in Figure 2A. Imaged lungs were excised from mice that were untreated (“–”; shown in E only) or intranasally instilled with IAV (“+”; A–E) at 24 hours before excision. High-power confocal views (B–D) of the structural alveolar niche (A, arrow) demonstrate, in IAV-infected lungs, time-dependent decrease of dextran pool width (white dashed lines and text) but not airspace width (magenta dashed lines and text). For group data (E), circles indicate n and each represent 1 mouse in which widths were quantified at 10 random locations in an imaging field containing at least 30 alveoli. Bars represent mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05 as indicated by ANOVA with post hoc Tukey testing. CR, calcein red-orange; alv, alveolar airspace. Scale bars: 50 (A) and 15 (B) μm. (F–H) Group data quantify change of TRITC-dextran fluorescence in alveolar airspaces of live, intact lungs. Mice were untreated (F) or intranasally instilled with IAV (G and H) at 24 hours before lung excision for imaging. The alveolar epithelium was pretreated as indicated with alveolar microinstillation of HEPES-buffered solution (Buffer) or the indicated reagents dissolved in HEPES-buffered solution; then alveolar airspaces were microinstilled with dextran. Circles indicate n and each represent 1 mouse in which mean dextran fluorescence change was quantified in imaging fields of at least 30 alveoli. Note that dextran fluorescence increased in buffer-treated alveoli of IAV-infected lungs (G, first bar), suggesting that the dextran concentration increased over time. Bars represent mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05 as indicated by ANOVA with post hoc Tukey testing (F and G) or 2-tailed t test (H). By contrast, time-dependent gain of airspace dextran fluorescence in alveoli of IAV-infected lungs (Figure 2, B–D, bottom row, and Figure 2E, open circles) indicates that dextran concentration progressively increased. At the same time, dextran pool width progressively decreased whereas airspace width was steady (Figure 3, A–D, white and magenta dashed lines, and Figure 3E, third and fourth bars), indicating that airspace liquid volume decreased during the period of dextran fluorescence gain. We interpret that IAV induced airspace liquid absorption. Equalization of airspace and microvascular dextran concentrations failed to abrogate the fluorescence gain (Supplemental Figure 2A), ruling out the possibility that the liquid absorption resulted from an osmotic gradient generated by our preparation. Persistence of the dextran fluorescence gain in lungs infected with IAV for 3 days (Supplemental Figure 2B) indicates that airspace liquid absorption was a sustained feature of IAV lung infection. Together, these findings show that IAV induced airspace liquid absorption in alveoli and suggest that it inhibited AWL secretion. IAV disrupts alveolar liquid dynamics through effects on CFTR and ENaC function. To determine mechanisms, we repeated the dextran microinstillation experiments after alveolar epithelial exposure to pharmacologic activators and inhibitors of CFTR and ENaC, ion channels that respectively drive AWL secretion (31, 36) and lung liquid uptake (37, 38). First, we confirmed that baseline AWL secretion depends on alveolar epithelial CFTR function (31) by blocking airspace dextran fluorescence loss in untreated lungs with the CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172 (Figure 3F, middle bar). The ENaC inhibitor amiloride had no effect on dextran fluorescence loss (Figure 3F, right bar), confirming reports that ENaC function does not contribute to alveolar liquid dynamics under baseline conditions (31). By contrast, in IAV-infected lungs, amiloride abolished dextran fluorescence gain (Figure 3G, middle bar), indicating that ENaC activity drove IAV-induced airspace liquid absorption in alveoli. Restoration of dextran fluorescence loss in alveoli treated with the CFTR activator forskolin (Figure 3G, right bar) signaled that IAV blocked CFTR function to inhibit AWL secretion. Taking these findings together, we conclude that IAV lung infection had a dual effect on the alveolar epithelium characterized by ENaC activation and CFTR inhibition. The result was stimulation of airspace liquid absorption and loss of AWL secretion, leading to net liquid absorption in alveoli of IAV-infected lungs. Importantly, drug-induced activation of CFTR in the alveolar epithelium overcame the IAV effect to restore, hence “rescue,” AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs. Steady airspace dextran fluorescence in CFTR-inhibited alveoli of uninfected lungs (Figure 3F, middle bar) indicates that CFTR inhibition did not reveal or induce airspace liquid absorption under baseline conditions. These findings suggest that CFTR does not regulate ENaC function in the alveolar epithelium, though it may have a regulatory role in other epithelia (39). To determine the relationship between CFTR and ENaC function in IAV-infected lungs, we treated the alveolar epithelium with ivacaftor, a potentiator of human and murine CFTR (40), or ivacaftor and amiloride together. As expected, ivacaftor restored dextran fluorescence loss in IAV-infected lungs (Figure 3H, left bar), indicating that CFTR potentiation in the alveolar epithelium rescued AWL secretion. The ivacaftor-induced fluorescence loss was augmented by amiloride (Figure 3H, right bar), indicating that ENaC inhibition and CFTR potentiation had additive effects on the restoration of AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs. These findings suggest that CFTR inhibition and ENaC activation occurred by separate mechanisms in IAV-infected lungs and support the notion that CFTR and ENaC function independently in the alveolar epithelium. IAV-induced loss of AWL secretion results from alveolar CFTR dephosphorylation. Mechanisms of CFTR inhibition include protein degradation (32, 33) and dephosphorylation (41, 42). To define how IAV inhibited CFTR, we applied established methods of immunoblot quantification of total and dephosphorylated CFTR protein (41, 43–45) to whole-lung lysate. Immunoblots and band densitometry with and without actin normalization show that total lung CFTR protein content was equal in PBS- and IAV-instilled lungs at 24 hours after instillation (Figure 4, A and B, and Supplemental Figure 3A). However, density of the dephosphorylation-sensitive (41, 44) band was increased in lysate of IAV-instilled lungs, yielding an increased ratio of dephosphorylated CFTR to total CFTR band densities (Figure 4, A, C, and D, and Supplemental Figure 3, B and C). We interpret that lung content of dephosphorylated CFTR protein increased after IAV infection, whereas total CFTR protein content was unchanged. These findings indicate that IAV induced CFTR dephosphorylation in the lung within 24 hours of infection onset. Figure 4IAV lung infection causes CFTR dephosphorylation. (A–D) Lungs from mice intranasally instilled with IAV or PBS were excised at 24 hours after instillation and homogenized. Representative images (A) and group data of band densitometry (B–D) show immunoblot results using antibodies against total (clone A-3) and dephosphorylated (clone 570) CFTR protein as indicated. For group data (B–D), circles indicate n and each represent lungs of 1 mouse. Lanes were run on the same gel but were noncontiguous. *P < 0.05 by 2-tailed t test. (E–G) Mice were treated with (a) intranasal instillation of liposome-complexed plasmid DNA encoding the plasmid vector, A1440X mutant CFTR, or non-mutant CFTR; then (b) intranasal instillation of IAV at 24 hours. Lungs were excised at 48 hours after plasmid instillation for immunoblot (E and F) or imaging (G). In E and F, representative images (E) and group data of band densitometry (F) show immunoblot results using the indicated antibodies against total and dephosphorylated CFTR protein. Lanes were run on the same gel but were noncontiguous. Actin-probed membranes are not shown. In F and G, circles indicate n and each represent lungs of 1 mouse. In G, group data were derived by confocal imaging of live, intact, perfused mouse lungs and show change of TRITC-dextran fluorescence in alveolar airspaces after alveolar dextran microinstillation. Mean dextran fluorescence change was quantified in an imaging field of at least 30 alveoli. Bars represent mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05 by 1-tailed t test (F) or as indicated by ANOVA with post hoc Tukey testing (G). To evaluate whether CFTR dephosphorylation mediated IAV-induced AWL inhibition, we quantified AWL secretion in lungs pretreated with plasmid DNA encoding mutant, dephosphorylation-resistant CFTR protein (41, 46). The A1440X mutant CFTR contains a stop mutation at residue 1440, causing deletion of the 40 C-terminal amino acids, including major phosphatase binding sites (41, 46). Thus, although the mutant CFTR retains cell surface expression and Cl– channel activity, it is dephosphorylated at a slow rate (41). After confirming the expected A1440X deletion by plasmid sequencing (data not shown), we transfected the alveolar epithelium with mutant CFTR or plasmid vector by intranasal instillation. We chose the intranasal route because our group has shown that intranasal plasmid instillation leads to plasmid expression in the alveolar epithelium (27, 47) and that the alveolar barrier blocks the trans-barrier spread of transfecting nucleotides (48, 49). Our immunoblot findings show that alveolar epithelial transfection with mutant CFTR blocked CFTR dephosphorylation in IAV-infected lungs but had no effect on total CFTR protein in lungs that were either IAV-infected or uninfected (Figure 4, E and F, and Supplemental Figure 3, D–G). These findings indicate that mutant CFTR transfection functioned as expected to block IAV-induced CFTR dephosphorylation, but it did so without increasing total lung CFTR content, perhaps because of the known accelerated degradation of truncated CFTR mutants (50). Follow-up experiments using live lung imaging showed that mutant CFTR transfection induced airspace dextran fluorescence loss in alveoli of IAV-infected lungs (Figure 4G), indicating that alveolar epithelial expression of mutant CFTR protein disrupted the IAV effect to rescue AWL secretion. In control experiments, we transfected the alveolar epithelium with plasmid DNA encoding non-mutant CFTR, with the expectation that this transfection would fail to rescue AWL secretion. However, contrary to our expectation, non-mutant CFTR transfection also rescued AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs (Figure 4G). Taking the imaging and immunoblot findings together, we interpret that IAV blocked AWL secretion by causing CFTR dephosphorylation in the alveolar epithelium. The IAV effect was disrupted by alveolar transfection with either mutant, dephosphorylation-resistant CFTR or non-mutant CFTR. IAV-induced loss of AWL secretion causes alveolar retention of inhaled SA. Our published data show that alveolar CFTR inhibition blocks spontaneous clearance of SA from alveoli (27), raising the possibility that loss of AWL secretion promotes alveolar SA stabilization. To test this possibility, we quantified the effect of AWL inhibition on alveolar stability of GFP-labeled SA in stationary growth phase (SAGFP). We selected the stationary growth phase because it may reflect the state of SA inhaled from the nasal cavity (51), since bacteria in stationary-like growth phases are prone to surface detachment (52). High-power images show that alveolar microinstillation of SAGFP in alveoli pretreated with either buffer or CFTRinh-172 caused formation of SAGFP microaggregates at alveolar niches (Figure 5, A–C). The microaggregates were of equal size (Figure 5D) and incorporated equal numbers of SAGFP (Figure 5E, first and third bars), indicating that CFTR inhibition had no effect on microaggregate formation. Since microaggregate size (Figure 5D) exceeded the 6 μm tip opening diameter of the microinstillation pipettes, we rule out the possibility that the microaggregates formed prior to microinstillation. At 1 hour after microinstillation, we attempted to wash out the SAGFP microaggregates by vigorous airspace buffer microinjection. Whereas washout caused loss of microaggregate fluorescence in buffer-pretreated alveoli (Figure 5, B and C, top images, and Figure 5E, second bar), it failed to clear microaggregates from CFTR-inhibited alveoli (Figure 5, B and C, bottom images, and Figure 5E, fourth bar). Low-power images affirmed the high-power findings (Figure 5, F–H). These data indicate that microaggregates in buffer-pretreated alveoli were susceptible to washout and, therefore, unstable against alveolar walls. However, microaggregates in CFTR-inhibited alveoli were highly stable and resisted dislodgement. We interpret that CFTR inhibition in the alveolar epithelium promoted stabilization of SAGFP in alveoli. Thus, loss of alveolar epithelial CFTR function generated an alveolar microenvironment in which SAGFP rapidly shifted phenotype from unstable to stabilized. Figure 5Alveolar epithelial CFTR function protects against alveolar stabilization of SAGFP. (A–H) High-power confocal images (A–C) and associated group data (D and E) and low-power images (F and G) and associated group data (H) show SAGFP fluorescence in alveolar airspaces before and after alveolar washout. We pretreated alveoli with microinstillation of HEPES-buffered solution (Buffer) or CFTRinh-172 dissolved in HEPES-buffered solution, as indicated, then microinstilled alveolar airspaces with SAGFP. Alveoli were subjected to washout by vigorous alveolar microinstillation of buffer at 1 hour after SAGFP microinstillation. Arrowheads (B, C, F, and G) point out example SAGFP microaggregates (MA) that had complete loss of fluorescence in response to washout, hence were cleared from alveoli. In A, dashed squares indicate locations of images shown in B and C. In F and G, fluorescence of the alveolar epithelium is not shown, but dashed lines delineate example alveolar walls. Circles in D, E, and H indicate n. In D and E, circles each refer to one MA randomly selected before washout from 4 imaging fields of at least 30 alveoli. In H, circles were each generated by comparison of mean SAGFP fluorescence before and after washout in 1 imaging field of at least 30 alveoli. Bars represent mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05 by 2-tailed t test (D and H) or as indicated by ANOVA with post hoc Tukey testing (E). Scale bars: 20 (A), 8 (B), and 50 (F) μm. Since IAV blocked alveolar epithelial CFTR function (Figure 3G), we considered that IAV might promote the stabilization of inhaled SAGFP in alveoli. To test this hypothesis, we used live lung imaging to view alveoli after 2 intranasal instillations in mice: IAV or PBS, then, 24 hours later, SAGFP. Within 1 hour of instillation in IAV-infected lungs, SAGFP formed microaggregates and small clusters in alveoli (Figure 6A). In line with our published findings (27), small clusters of non-microaggregated SAGFP were present on flat alveolar surfaces (Figure 6A, single arrow), and microaggregates were located at alveolar niches (Figure 6A, inset and double arrows). Microaggregates and small clusters formed with equal frequency (Figure 6B) and size (Figure 6C) in alveoli of mice pretreated with IAV or PBS, indicating that the micromechanical features of alveoli that determine bacterial group formation were preserved in IAV-infected lungs. To determine the time course of spontaneous bacterial clearance, we imaged SAGFP-containing alveoli at 1 and 3 hours after SAGFP instillation. Whereas most SAGFP groups in PBS-pretreated lungs had complete loss of alveolar fluorescence (Figure 6D, top row, arrowheads, and Figure 6E, left bar), indicating that the bacteria were spontaneously removed from alveoli, the rate of alveolar SAGFP fluorescence loss was markedly diminished in IAV-infected lungs (Figure 6D, bottom row, and Figure 6E, right bar), indicating that IAV caused failure of alveolar SAGFP clearance. Together, these findings show that while IAV had no effect on niche-based microaggregate formation by inhaled SAGFP, it blocked alveolar SAGFP clearance to promote SAGFP retention in alveoli. Figure 6IAV lung infection causes alveolar retention of inhaled SAGFP. Mice were pretreated with intranasal instillation of IAV or PBS as indicated, then intranasally instilled with SAGFP 24 hours later. For group data, circles indicate n and each represent 1 mouse. Bars represent mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05 as indicated by 2-tailed t test. (A–C) Low-power (inset) and high-power confocal images (A) show SAGFP fluorescence in live alveoli of intact, blood-perfused, IAV-infected mouse lungs, 1 hour after intranasal SAGFP instillation. Dashed lines delineate example alveolar walls (fluorescence not shown). Single and double arrows indicate SAGFP grouped as small clusters (SC) and microaggregates (MA), respectively. Group data show number (B) and size (C) of SCs and MAs in alveoli of lungs pretreated with PBS or IAV instillation. For B and C, SAGFP group number and size were quantified as means in at least 2 imaged fields of 30 alveoli each. Alv, example alveolar airspace. Scale bars: 50 (inset) and 10 μm. (D and E) Confocal images (D) show alveolar SAGFP fluorescence at 1 hour (left) and, in the same alveoli, at 3 hours (right) after SAGFP instillation. Arrowheads indicate example MAs that spontaneously lost all fluorescence, hence were cleared from alveoli. Group data (E) show the proportion of SAGFP MAs that maintained alveolar fluorescence, hence were retained in alveoli. For E, MAs were quantified as the mean proportion retained in at least 2 imaged fields of 30 alveoli each. Scale bars: 50 μm. (F) Content of viable SAGFP in lung homogenate at 3 hours after intranasal SAGFP instillation. We considered that the retention might result from IAV-induced inhibition of SA killing (19, 20) or dissemination mechanisms. However, recovery of an equal number of viable SAGFP from whole-lung homogenate of IAV- and PBS-pretreated mice (Figure 6F) indicates that SA killing was not impaired in IAV-infected lungs. Moreover, absence of CD11b+ cells in alveolar airspaces at 24 hours after IAV instillation and 3 hours after SAGFP instillation (Supplemental Figure 4, A–E) rules out a role for neutrophils (53) — major effectors of SA killing — in the retention mechanism. To test whether the retention resulted from inhibition of SA dissemination, we quantified SAGFP at extrapulmonary sites at 3 hours after SAGFP instillation. Numbers of viable SAGFP in blood, spleen, and liver were equal in mice pretreated with IAV and PBS (Supplemental Figure 5, A–C) and, in aggregate, represented less than 0.01% of the SAGFP inoculum (Supplemental Figure 5D). These data indicate that inhibition of SA dissemination did not account for the retention. We interpret that failure of SA killing and dissemination were not mechanisms by which IAV caused alveolar SAGFP retention. Alternatively, the retention could have resulted from IAV-induced loss of CFTR-dependent AWL secretion, leading to loss of the alveolus-to-airway liquid flow that normally displaces particles from alveoli (31). To determine whether the retention resulted from CFTR inhibition, we evaluated alveolar SAGFP retention in IAV-infected mice treated with the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor. We first affirmed that, like alveolar microinstillation of ivacaftor (Figure 3H), intraperitoneal injection of ivacaftor rescued AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs (Figure 7A). These findings show that systemic ivacaftor administration restored CFTR function in alveoli. Next, we tested the effect of ivacaftor on alveolar retention of intranasally instilled SAGFP in IAV-infected lungs. Ivacaftor blocked the retention (Figure 7B), indicating that CFTR inhibition was central to the retention mechanism. Figure 7Systemic CFTR potentiation rescues AWL secretion and blocks alveolar SAGFP stabilization in IAV-infected mice. Group data quantify confocal images of live, intact, perfused lungs. Mice were given intranasal instillation of IAV, then, at 6 hours, intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (Veh) or ivacaftor (Ivac) as indicated. (A) Lungs were excised for imaging at 24 hours after IAV instillation, and alveoli were microinstilled with TRITC-labeled dextran. Data show change of dextran fluorescence in alveolar airspaces. (B) At 24 hours after IAV instillation, mice were intranasally instilled with SAGFP, then the lungs were immediately excised for imaging. Data show spontaneous change of SAGFP microaggregate (MA) fluorescence in alveolar airspaces from 1–3 hours after intranasal SAGFP instillation. Circles indicate n and each represent 1 mouse in which change of dextran (A) or SAGFP (B) fluorescence was quantified in imaging fields of at least 30 alveoli. Bars represent mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05 by 2-tailed t test. Taking these findings together, we conclude that IAV-induced CFTR inhibition disrupted alveolar clearance of inhaled SAGFP, causing SAGFP to assume a stabilized phenotype against alveolar walls. CFTR-targeted rescue of AWL secretion disrupted the stabilization to block alveolar SAGFP retention and restore clearance of inhaled SAGFP from alveoli. AWL rescue is protective in mouse models of IAV-SA coinfection. Our imaging findings show that IAV disrupted alveolar defense against inhaled SAGFP within hours of IAV lung infection. To determine the extent to which the imaging data correlate with mouse models of lung infection, we compared mortality, lung injury, and lung inflammation in mice infected with IAV, SAGFP, and IAV and SAGFP together. Mice were given 2 intranasal instillations, 24 hours apart (Figure 8A). Whereas mice instilled with IAV or SAGFP alone each survived at least 3 days after the second instillation, mice coinfected with IAV and SAGFP had nearly 50% mortality (Figure 8B), indicating that IAV augmented SAGFP pathogenesis when SAGFP was instilled 24 hours after IAV. Figure 8IAV augments the lung pathogenesis of SAGFP. Experimental design (A) for group data (B–E) indicates timing of intranasal instillations, survival (B) and breathing score (C) assessments, and BAL fluid collection for quantifications of total protein (D) and leukocytes (E). All mice were given a series of 2 instillations as indicated. Breathing scores (C) were imputed for non-surviving mice using their last observed value. Squares (C) and bars (D and E) indicate mean ± SEM; circles (D and E) indicate n and each represent data from 1 mouse; *P < 0.05 vs. black line by log rank (B) or 2-tailed t test (C) or as indicated by ANOVA with post hoc Tukey testing (D and E). BAL contents of protein (D) and leukocytes (E) were quantified using the same fluid specimens. To determine mortality mechanisms, we assigned scores to the mice using an observational breathing score system (Supplemental Figure 6A) in which higher score correlated with higher bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein content (Supplemental Figure 6B), a marker of alveolar barrier dysfunction. Within hours of instillation, SAGFP induced breathing abnormalities in mice pretreated with PBS or IAV (Figure 8C). Whereas the breathing abnormalities resolved within 24 hours in mice infected with SAGFP alone (Figure 8C, black line), they persisted for days in coinfected mice (Figure 8C, magenta line). Mice infected with IAV alone had minimal breathing abnormalities during this period (Figure 8C, gold line). In line with the breathing scores, BAL protein content at 48 hours after SAGFP instillation was increased only in coinfected mice (Figure 8D), indicating that IAV augmented SAGFP-induced alveolar barrier dysfunction. By contrast, BAL leukocyte content was equal across groups (Figure 8E). Taking these findings together, we interpret that IAV augmented SAGFP-induced lung injury and mortality in a mouse model in which IAV instillation preceded SAGFP instillation by 24 hours. We have shown previously that stabilization of inhaled SA in alveoli leads to SA-induced alveolar damage and fatal lung injury (27). We considered that, by restoring AWL secretion and blocking alveolar SA retention (Figure 7, A and B), AWL rescue therapy might protect against fatal SA-induced lung injury in IAV-infected mice. To test this possibility, we treated coinfected mice with systemic injection of vehicle or ivacaftor (Figure 9A). Whereas coinfected mice treated with vehicle had high mortality (Figure 9B, solid line), all coinfected mice treated with ivacaftor survived (Figure 9B, dashed line). These findings show that AWL rescue therapy protected against SAGFP-induced mortality in coinfected mice. Figure 9AWL rescue therapy protects against fatal IAV-SAGFP coinfection. (A–G) Experimental design (A) for group data shown in B–G shows timing of intranasal instillations, intraperitoneal injections, and procedures including mouse survival (B) and breathing score (C) assessments, lung excision for quantification of lung wet weight to body weight (LW/BW) ratio (D), BAL fluid collection for quantification of total protein (E) and leukocyte (F) content, and lung excision for SAGFP quantification (CFU; G). Note that 3 mice were untreated and are indicated in D (first bar). Breathing scores (C) were imputed for non-surviving mice using their last observed value. Squares (C) and bars (D–G) indicate mean ± SEM; circles (D–G) indicate n and each represent data from 1 mouse; *P < 0.05 vs. black line by log rank (B) or 2-tailed t test (C) or as indicated by 1- (D) or 2-tailed (E–G) t test. BAL contents of protein (E) and leukocytes (F) were quantified using the same fluid specimen. Next, we defined the extent to which ivacaftor’s survival benefit stemmed from protection against SAGFP-induced lung injury. Compared with coinfected mice treated with vehicle, mice treated with ivacaftor had lower breathing score, lung wet weight to body weight ratio, BAL protein content, and blood-free extravascular lung water content after SAGFP instillation (Figure 9, C–E, and Supplemental Figure 7), indicating that AWL rescue therapy protected against SAGFP-induced lung injury in IAV-infected mice. To determine whether ivacaftor’s therapeutic benefit resulted from drug-induced leukocyte modulation (54) or SA killing (55), we quantified lung inflammation and SA burden (Figure 9A). Our findings show that ivacaftor had no effect on BAL leukocyte content or SAGFP counts in whole-lung homogenate, BAL fluid, blood, spleen, or liver at multiple time points after SAGFP instillation in IAV-infected mice (Figure 9, F and G, and Supplemental Figure 8, A–H), indicating that ivacaftor did not impact BAL-accessible lung inflammation, SA dissemination, or SA viability. In mice infected with IAV alone, equivalent survival, breathing score, BAL protein content, BAL leukocyte content, and lung IAV content between ivacaftor- and vehicle-treated groups (Figure 10, A–F) rule out the possibility that ivacaftor’s therapeutic effect in coinfected mice resulted from modulation of the primary IAV infection. Failure of ivacaftor to impact BAL protein or leukocyte content in mice infected with SAGFP alone (Supplemental Figure 9, A–C) indicates that prior infection with IAV was required for ivacaftor to exert a therapeutic effect in the time frame of our experiments. Taking these findings together, we interpret that ivacaftor decreased SAGFP-induced mortality after IAV infection by protecting against lung responses to IAV that promoted SAGFP-induced lung injury. We conclude that systemic CFTR potentiation increased survival in coinfected mice by rescuing AWL secretion after IAV infection, in turn protecting against the alveolar stabilization of inhaled SAGFP and mitigating SAGFP-induced lung injury. Figure 10AWL rescue therapy does not affect early outcomes of IAV lung infection. (A–F) Experimental design (A) for group data shown in B–F shows timing of intranasal instillations, intraperitoneal injections, and procedures including mouse survival (B) and breathing score (C) assessments, BAL fluid collection for quantification of total protein (D) and leukocyte (E) content, and lung excision for IAV quantification (PFU; F). Breathing scores (C) were imputed for non-surviving mice using their last observed value. Squares (C) and bars (D–F) indicate mean ± SEM; circles (D–F) indicate n and each represent data from 1 mouse; P values were calculated vs. black line by log rank (B) or 2-tailed t test (C) or as indicated by 2-tailed t test (D–F). BAL contents of protein (D) and leukocytes (E) were quantified using the same BAL fluid specimen. It is not known whether CFTR dephosphorylation determines the pathogenicity of SA coinfection with IAV. To address this question, we pretreated mice with intranasal instillation of mutant, dephosphorylation-resistant CFTR plasmid, non-mutant CFTR plasmid, or plasmid vector. The pretreatment was followed by intranasal instillations of IAV, then SAGFP (Figure 11A). Whereas vector-treated mice had high mortality (Figure 11B, magenta line), mice transfected with mutant CFTR had reduced mortality and breathing scores (Figure 11, B and C). Mice transfected with non-mutant CFTR also had reduced mortality and breathing scores (Figure 11, B and C). Together with the immunoblot and imaging data (Figure 4, E–G), these findings show that alveolar epithelial expression of mutant, dephosphorylation-resistant (41, 46) CFTR protein or non-mutant CFTR protein each rescued AWL secretion and protected against SAGFP-induced mortality in IAV-infected mice. We conclude that IAV-induced CFTR dephosphorylation in the alveolar epithelium was central to the lung pathogenesis of IAV-SAGFP coinfection. Figure 11CFTR transfections protect against SAGFP-induced mortality in IAV-infected mice.

Circles (C) indicate mean ± SEM; n as indicated; *P < 0.05 vs. magenta line by log rank testing (B) or 2-tailed t test (C). Discussion Our findings show, for the first time to our knowledge, that IAV lung infection caused reversal of alveolar liquid dynamics from epithelial secretion to absorption. The reversal occurred within hours of IAV instillation and resulted from 2 effects of IAV infection on the alveolar epithelium: CFTR inhibition, leading to loss of AWL secretion; and ENaC stimulation, causing alveolar liquid absorption. Alveolar epithelial treatment with CFTR activator or potentiator drugs rapidly restored AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs, indicating that the electrochemical and osmotic gradients that normally drive AWL secretion were intact, and thus the AWL inhibition resulted directly from CFTR inhibition. The effect was the abrogation of a major mechanism of alveolar defense — namely, AWL secretion — to generate an alveolar microenvironment favorable to the stabilization of inhaled SA against alveolar walls. Thus, the new understanding gained from our findings is that AWL secretion is a major mechanism of innate alveolar defense against inhaled SA. Its inhibition by IAV lung infection promoted the initiation of SA infection in alveoli, leading to fatal SA-induced lung injury. Since acute lung injury is traditionally defined by gain of airspace liquid, as pulmonary edema fluid (12, 13), our proposal that coinfection-induced lung injury resulted from loss of airspace liquid, as AWL, adds new understanding to lung injury mechanisms. Our findings show that IAV blocked AWL secretion, leading to retention of SA against alveolar walls for hours. The retention enabled SA, a pathogen known for its ability to rapidly adapt to its microenvironment (56), to transition from an unstable phenotype susceptible to alveolar clearance to a highly stable phenotype that resisted alveolar dislodgement. Thus, the alveolar microenvironment generated by IAV-induced loss of AWL secretion created an opportunity for SA to rapidly assume a stabilized phenotype that, we have shown previously, initiates alveolar infection and fatal alveolar damage (27). We interpret that AWL secretion contributes critically to alveolar defense against inhaled SA, and that AWL inhibition constitutes a major mechanism by which IAV promotes secondary SA infection. How IAV-induced AWL inhibition caused alveolar SA retention remains unclear. Our findings show that CFTR inhibition in the alveolar epithelium did not affect formation of SA microaggregates but enabled their stabilization. Since our published data show that alveolar microaggregate stabilization results from SA interactions involving the SA surface protein PhnD (27), we propose that alveolar CFTR inhibition promoted the formation of stabilizing protein interactions among microaggregated SA. Such interactions might result from loss of CFTR-mediated HCO3– secretion that could lower extracellular pH to a level favorable to SA self-adherence (57). At the same time, loss of CFTR-mediated, Cl–-driven AWL flow might block convective transport (31) of non-adherent SA out of alveoli. We rule out alternative mechanisms of alveolar SA retention, namely inhibition of SA killing or dissemination, by our findings that IAV had no effect on numbers of viable SA in the lungs or extrapulmonary organs. Although the mechanistic details remain uncertain, our finding that AWL rescue therapy restored alveolar SA clearance in IAV-infected lungs points to CFTR inhibition as a critical step in the retention mechanism. Our data identify a central role for CFTR dephosphorylation in the alveolar pathogenesis of IAV lung infection. It is known that CFTR is expressed by alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) and 2 (AT2) cells (58–63) and drives alveolar epithelial secretion of Cl– and liquid under baseline conditions (31, 36, 61, 64, 65). Here, we add that IAV blocked CFTR-mediated AWL secretion and induced CFTR dephosphorylation. Importantly, plasmid-mediated inhibition of CFTR dephosphorylation in the alveolar epithelium rescued AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs, indicating that alveolar epithelial CFTR dephosphorylation was responsible for IAV-induced AWL inhibition. Thus, the efficacy of forskolin and ivacaftor for rescuing AWL secretion may have been related to their known capacity to potentiate CFTR function under non-phosphorylating conditions (66, 67). Together, these findings reveal a new mechanism of IAV-induced CFTR inhibition in the lung. The capacity of non-mutant CFTR transfection to rescue AWL secretion and protect against SA-induced mortality in IAV-infected mice raises the possibility that dephosphorylation was not the sole mechanism by which IAV blocked CFTR function in the alveolar epithelium. For example, IAV might promote loss of CFTR protein in alveoli, in line with reports of IAV-induced CFTR ubiquitination and degradation in cultured airway epithelial cells (33, 34). Although we did not identify CFTR protein loss by immunoblot of whole-lung lysate after intranasal IAV instillation, the immunoblot may have failed to detect protein loss in alveoli if alveolar epithelial responses to IAV were masked by responses of non-alveolar cells. Alternatively, non-mutant CFTR transfection could have induced sufficient CFTR overexpression in the alveolar epithelium to overcome the inhibition caused by CFTR dephosphorylation, thereby rescuing AWL secretion in IAV-infected mice. These issues, as well as the upstream mechanisms responsible for IAV-induced CFTR dephosphorylation, warrant further study. Our finding that IAV lung infection induced reversal of alveolar liquid dynamics — from basal AWL secretion to airspace liquid absorption — is, to our knowledge, novel, but it is well supported by existing literature. Our data demonstrating the presence of basal AWL secretion align with reports indicating that the intact alveolar epithelium secretes Na+ (36), Cl– (31, 36, 64), and liquid (31, 36) under baseline conditions. Although it is known that AT1 and AT2 cells express ENaC (68–70) and exhibit rapid reversal from liquid secretion to absorption in response to local conditions (36, 61), our findings are the first, to our knowledge, to show that reversal from CFTR-mediated liquid secretion to ENaC-mediated liquid absorption occurred in the alveolar epithelium in response to IAV infection. The reversal of alveolar liquid dynamics had major bearing on the outcome of IAV-SA coinfection in that it promoted alveolar SA retention. While others have reported seemingly opposite findings, that IAV blocks lung absorption of airway-instilled liquid in rodents (71, 72), we point out that the contribution of the small airway epithelium to bulk transport of airway-instilled liquid is not understood. Importantly, our data provide direct evidence that IAV caused liquid absorption in airspaces of intact, perfused alveoli. Future research might build on our findings by defining whether AWL inhibition depends on direct IAV infection of alveoli and quantifying the extent to which AT1 cells, AT2 cells, and their subpopulations (73) determine liquid transport in perfused alveoli of IAV-infected and uninfected lungs. AT1 cells may drive alveolar liquid transport on account of their extensive surface area, which comprises more than 97% of the luminal alveolar surface (74). An important aspect of our findings is the demonstration that IAV disrupted alveolar physiology in the first hours of lung infection. Although others have shown that IAV augments SA-induced lung pathogenesis when SA is instilled in mice at 3 days after IAV instillation (21, 22), there is limited understanding of lung responses to IAV and IAV-SA coinfection at earlier time points. Early alveolar responses to IAV that predispose to SA lung infection may have clinical relevance, since clinical data show that secondary bacterial infection may occur as early as 1–3 days after the onset of respiratory symptoms (6, 11, 75, 76) and cause symptoms indistinguishable from those of influenza alone (6, 77). From a therapeutic perspective, our data suggest that AWL rescue represents a new therapeutic target for preventing fatal SA-induced lung injury after IAV infection. Although systemic ivacaftor injection induced only modest regain of AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs, the gain was nevertheless sufficient to block alveolar stabilization of inhaled SA, perhaps because it was distributed across an extensive alveolar epithelial surface (25, 26). Subsequently, AWL rescue therapy decreased SA-induced lung injury and mortality in IAV-infected mice. Notably, ivacaftor decreased SA-induced alveolar barrier dysfunction without altering BAL-accessible lung leukocyte numbers or pathogen burden, placing alveolar responses to IAV and SA at the center of coinfection pathogenesis mechanisms and suggesting that protection against alveolar barrier dysfunction accounted for ivacaftor’s therapeutic effect. Although nonspecific mechanisms may have contributed, we propose that fatal SA-induced lung injury resulted from IAV-induced loss of AWL secretion, leading to alveolar retention of SA. Approaches that rescue AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs may prevent secondary SA infection in alveoli, thereby decreasing SA-induced lung injury and mortality. Future studies might investigate the extent to which ivacaftor is protective after SA infection has already initiated. Since ivacaftor is already in clinical use and has an excellent safety and tolerability profile (78), these findings may be translatable to patients. In conclusion, our findings show that IAV lung infection induced reversal of normal alveolar liquid dynamics to cause airspace liquid absorption and inhibit AWL secretion. Thus, IAV infection abrogated a major mechanism of alveolar defense, leading to alveolar retention of inhaled SA and fatal SA-induced lung injury. Therapeutic rescue of AWL secretion was protective. These findings contribute new understanding of the role of alveolar liquid in health and lung injury. First, AWL secretion was critical to lung defense against inhaled SA, since loss of AWL secretion promoted alveolar SA infection. Second, although pathogen-induced lung injury is traditionally defined by gain of alveolar liquid (edema), our findings show that loss of alveolar liquid (AWL) was critical to IAV lung pathogenesis. Therapeutic approaches that restore AWL secretion in IAV-infected lungs may protect against fatal SA coinfection. Methods Experimental design. Experiments were designed according to Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. Experimental units were single mice unless otherwise indicated. Mice used for in vivo studies were allocated to groups in a manner that ensured roughly equal mean mouse weight per group. Groups were mixed within cages, and assessments of breathing abnormalities and need for euthanasia were carried out by an investigator blinded to mouse groups. Outcome measures are indicated in figures and legends. Fluorophores. We purchased calcein, acetoxymethyl ester (AM; 10 μM), calcein red-orange AM (10 μM), and tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated dextran from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Reagents. Reagents were freshly constituted for experiments. Forskolin (20 μM) and amiloride (10 μM) were purchased from Selleckchem and CFTRinh-172 (20 μM) from MilliporeSigma. Ivacaftor was purchased from Selleckchem and reconstituted on delivery with DMSO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) before aliquoting and storage at –80°C. We prepared single doses of ivacaftor or vehicle within 1 hour of intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. Doses were 40 mg/kg ivacaftor in 5% DMSO, 5% Tween-80, 40% PEG300 (all from Selleckchem), and 50% of 0.9% saline (Grifols) solution. Vehicle was the identical weight-based solution volume without ivacaftor. Solutions. We purchased Ca2+- and Mg2+-containing Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS) and Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS from Corning. Isolated lungs were perfused with HEPES-buffered vehicle of pH 7.4 and osmolarity 295 mOsm containing 150 mM Na+, 5 mM K+, 1 mM Ca2+, 1 mM Mg2+, and 10 mM glucose. Except where noted, fluorophores, reagents, and antibodies microinstilled in alveoli were dissolved or suspended in the same HEPES-buffered solution. Antibodies. Antibodies were purchased from commercial vendors or academic institutions that provided antibody validation information. Allophycocyanin-conjugated monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CD11b (clone M1/70, catalog 14-0112-82, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was diluted 1:25 for alveolar microinstillation. Antibodies used for immunoblotting included mouse mAb against CFTR (clone A-3, catalog sc-376683, lot I2221, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (43); mouse mAb against dephosphorylated CFTR (clone 570, catalog AB570, lot 570TJ20200526, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill CFTR Antibody Distribution Program) (44, 45); and rabbit polyclonal antibody against actin (catalog A2066, lot 120878, MilliporeSigma). Secondary antibodies (LI-COR) included IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse (catalog 925-32210, lot D01110-02) and IRDye 680LT goat anti-rabbit (catalog 925-68021, lot C90501-05). Antibodies were diluted in StartingBlock T20 Blocking Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated with membranes as follows: CFTR mAb A-3 was diluted to 1:100 and incubated for 24–72 hours at 4°C; CFTR mAb 570 was diluted to 1:500 and incubated for 24 hours at 4°C; actin antibody was diluted to 1:2,000 and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature; and secondary antibodies were diluted to 1:10,000 and incubated for 40 minutes at room temperature. Viral preparation and inoculation. Mouse-adapted IAV A/Puerto Rico/8/934 was propagated in 8-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories), diluted in Ca2+- and Mg2+-containing DPBS, aliquoted, and stored at –80°C. IAV was intranasally instilled in anesthetized mice within 1 hour of thawing at a dose of 2,000 PFU in 20 μL or, for selected imaging experiments, 5,000 PFU in 50 μL. Bacterial strain, preparation, and inoculation. SA was GFP-tagged strain USA300 LAC (SAGFP). Bacteria were stored at –80°C in 25% glycerol in autoclaved Luria-Bertani (LB) broth media (MP Biomedicals) and propagated on LB-agar plates containing chloramphenicol (10 μg/mL; MilliporeSigma). Plates were refreshed from frozen stock every 1–2 weeks. For experiments, single bacterial colonies were propagated in autoclaved LB media containing chloramphenicol (10 μg/mL) in a shaking incubator at 37°C and 200 rpm (New Brunswick Scientific) for 18 hours (stationary growth phase) or, for selected experiments, to OD600nm = 1 (exponential growth phase). Bacteria were prepared for alveolar microinstillation or intranasal instillation, respectively, by dilution of 1 mL of culture in 500 μL or 1.3 mL in 300 μL of DPBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. Within 40 minutes of bacterial removal from the incubator, we instilled the bacteria-containing solution into lung alveolar airspaces by alveolar micropuncture or mice by intranasal instillation (30 μL to deliver 1 × 108 CFU per mouse). For intranasal instillations, mice were rapidly anesthetized and instilled in pairs to ensure similarity of inocula across animals. Animals. Mice were male Swiss Webster, purchased from Charles River Laboratories and Taconic Biosciences, 27–38 g, and 4–8 weeks old. We anesthetized mice with inhaled isoflurane (4%) for i.p. injections; or isoflurane and i.p. injections of ketamine (up to 100 mg/kg) and xylazine (up to 5 mg/kg) for intranasal instillations and surgical procedures. For surgeries, we injected the tail vein of anesthetized mice with heparin (50 U; Mylan), then exsanguinated the mice by cardiac puncture. Intranasal instillation and intraperitoneal injection. Instillation and injection qualities were recorded on a 4-point scale at the time of instillation or injection by the performing investigator. In general, quality was considered acceptable if the instillation was recorded as 3 to 4 (i.e., little or no loss of instillate observed) or the injection was recorded as 4 (i.e., no injury or fluid leakage at the injection site). Isolated, blood-perfused lungs. Using our reported methods (27), we cannulated the trachea, pulmonary artery, and left atrium of the heart of exsanguinated mice, then excised the heart, lungs, and cannulas en bloc. Lungs were inflated with room air through the tracheal cannula and perfused through the pulmonary arterial and left atrial cannulas at 0.4–0.6 mL/min with autologous blood in a solution of 4% dextran (70 kDa; Molecular Probes), 1% FBS (Gemini Bio-Products), and HEPES-buffered solution at pH 7.4, osmolality 320 mOsm/kg, and 37°C. We used in-line pressure transducers (ADInstruments) to maintain constant airway pressure 6 cm H2O via a continuous positive airway pressure machine (Philips Respironics) and pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures 10 and 3 cm H2O, respectively, via a roller pump (Ismatec). The lungs were positioned to enable micropuncture and imaging of the diaphragmatic surface of the right caudal lobe. Portions of the lung that were not used for micropuncture and imaging were covered with plastic wrap to prevent desiccation. Alveolar microinstillation. We hand-beveled glass micropipettes (Sutter Instruments) to micropuncture single alveoli under bright-field microscopy, as we have done previously (27). Micropunctured alveoli were instilled with fluorophores, reagents, and antibodies in solution, resulting in their spread from the micropunctured alveolus to neighboring alveoli. For bacterial microinstillations, we prepared SAGFP-containing solutions as above, then microinstilled the solutions to deliver approximately 104 CFU in 3 seconds of discontinuous microinstillation (79). Microinstillations were performed in 1–3 alveoli bordering each imaging field. Live lung imaging and analysis. By our established methods (27), we viewed alveoli by confocal microscopy (LSM800, Zeiss) with a ×20 water immersion objective (NA 1.0; Zeiss) and coverslip. We used bright-field microscopy to randomly select regions of 30–50 alveoli for microinstillation and imaging. All images were acquired as single images using Zen (v2.6, Zeiss) and recorded as Z-sections. Analyzed images were 4–8 μm below the pleura. Optical thickness was 32–34 μm. Frame size was 512 × 512 pixels. We established laser, filter, pinhole, and detector settings at the beginning of each experiment to optimize alveolar fluorescence and avoid fluorescence saturation, then maintained the settings for the duration of the experiment. We confirmed absence of bleed-through between fluorescence emission channels. Images were analyzed using ImageJ (v2.0.0-rc-69/1.52n, NIH). Brightness and contrast adjustments were applied to individual color channels of entire images and equally to all experiment groups. We did not apply downstream processing. Airspace dextran fluorescence determination. We used our established approach (27, 31) to microinstill airspaces with calcein-AM, then TRITC-conjugated dextran (70 kDa; 10 or 40 mg/mL in HEPES-buffered solution). Provided alveolar barrier function is intact, time-dependent loss of TRITC-dextran fluorescence indicates dilution by AWL secretion (31). Alveolar permeability determination. To determine alveolar barrier properties, we added TRITC-conjugated dextran (20 kDa; 10 mg/mL) to the intact lung perfusate solution using our established methods (27). Immunoblot. Using our reported methods (27), we cannulated the pulmonary artery of exsanguinated mice, then washed the lung vessels with ice-cold DPBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. The lungs were excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, then pulverized inside a specimen bag using a cold mortar and pestle. The pulverized lungs were mixed and incubated with RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Halt protease mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a tissue grinder for 40 minutes on ice, then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 15,000 g and 4°C. We used the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), a plate reader (Molecular Devices) to standardize protein loading in Laemmli 2× Concentrate sample buffer (MilliporeSigma), and deionized water for gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen). Samples were heated to 37°C or 65°C for 5 or 10 minutes on a heating block before loading. Band densities were quantified using Image Studio (v5.2, LI-COR). Plasmid preparation, transfection, and instillation. We transformed DH5α E. coli (New England Biolabs) with plasmid DNA via heat shock, then amplified and purified the plasmids using an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). By our established methods (27), we complexed plasmid DNA for A1440X mutant CFTR or non-mutant CFTR (gifts of Martina Gentzsch, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA) or vector (pcDNA 3.1, Invitrogen) with freshly extruded unilamellar liposomes (20 μg/μL; 100 nm pore size; DOTAP, Avanti Lipids) in sterile Opti-MEM (Gibco). For transfection, we administered 75 μg plasmid DNA per mouse by intranasal instillation. Survival assessment. A blinded investigator assessed and recorded mouse weight, breathing score, and need for euthanasia in line with our IACUC-approved protocol. Euthanasia need was determined by a scoring system that included observations of mouse appearance, breathing, behavior, gait, and response to stimulation by cage top opening and placement on a narrow beam. Mice instilled with IAV alone were assessed at 24-hour intervals post-instillation for 4 days. Mice instilled with SAGFP or PBS were assessed hourly for 6 hours after instillation, then at least every 12–24 hours for 3 days. Surviving mice were euthanized at the conclusion of experiments. Protein and leukocyte determinations in BAL fluid. Using our reported methods (27), we cannulated the trachea of exsanguinated mice, then lavaged the lungs with 5 sequential instillations of 1 mL of ice-cold, Ca2+-free PBS. For total protein determinations, we centrifuged the first aliquot of BAL fluid return (minimum volume 0.78 mL) for 10 minutes at 400 g and 4°C, then centrifuged the supernatant again for 20 minutes at 15,000 g and 4°C. Total protein was quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For leukocyte determinations, BAL samples were pooled on a per-mouse basis and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 500 g. The resuspended cells were incubated for 10 minutes in Türk’s solution (MilliporeSigma), then counted using a hemacytometer. Lung wet weight to body weight ratio and extravascular lung water quantifications. Lung wet weight and extravascular lung water (EVLW) were quantified in the same experiment. Body weight was recorded in anesthetized mice at the time of lung excision in untreated mice or at the time of IAV instillation in coinfected mice. We used our established methods (27) to exsanguinate anesthetized mice by cardiac puncture, then excised and weighed the lungs. Blood-free EVLW content was quantified by the method of Selinger and colleagues (80), which we have used previously (27). Lungs were cut with scissors, then processed using a handheld tissue homogenizer. Hemoglobin content was determined by spectrophotometry (Molecular Devices) using hemoglobin standards and a solution of Drabkin’s reagent and Brij L23 (MilliporeSigma). Homogenate, supernatant, and blood samples were dried for 24 hours in a vacuum oven at 57°C and –5 mmHg. Total EVLW content was normalized to body weight to account for increases of lung dry weight due to extravasated protein (81). Viral and bacterial counts. For bacterial quantifications, we collected blood by cardiac puncture, obtained BAL fluid by the methods above, and excised the spleen, liver, and lungs from exsanguinated mice using our reported methods (27). Organs were mechanically homogenized by crushing in a specimen bag and diluted in 1 mL of DPBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. SAGFP CFU was quantified by serial dilutions on chloramphenicol-containing LB agar plates. For viral quantifications, lungs were homogenized in homogenizer tubes (Benchmark Scientific) in 500 μL of Ca2+-free PBS. IAV PFU was determined by plaque assay (82). Briefly, homogenized lungs were 10-fold serially diluted starting from 1:10 dilution and added to a confluent monolayer of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (line CCL-34, ATCC) for 1 hour at 37°C and 5% CO2 with gentle rocking. The inoculum was removed, and the cells were overlaid with a solution composed of 1% agar (Oxoid) and 2× minimal essential medium supplemented with 1% diethyl-aminoethyl-dextran, 5% NaHCO3, and 1 μg/mL tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone–treated trypsin. Cell-containing plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2, then fixed in 10% formaldehyde overnight. Plaques were visualized by immune labeling with mAb against HT-103 (gift of Thomas Moran, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA), HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary detection antibody, and TrueBlue substrate (KPL-Seracare). Statistics. Statistics are indicated in figures and legends. In general, paired comparisons were analyzed by t tests, multiple comparisons by ANOVA with posthoc testing, and survival comparisons by log rank testing. We considered P values less than 0.05 to be statistically significant. Data were analyzed and figures were prepared using Microsoft Excel, StatPlus:mac Pro (version v7, AnalystSoft Inc.), and SigmaPlot (version 14.5, Systat). In rare instances, mice were excluded from analyses if instillations or tissue collections failed to meet our laboratory’s standards for quality. Reasons for exclusion included death within 5 minutes of SAGFP instillation (1 mouse), persistent gait abnormalities or bleeding at i.p. injection sites (3 mice), and trachea rupture during BAL fluid collection (1 mouse). Exclusion decisions were made in an identical manner for all groups and based on quality assessments performed while experiments were ongoing, thus prior to data analysis. Study approval.

Piracha, MD, FACP, FASN, FNKF, is a practicing physician at Methodist Willowbrook Hospital. learn more The flu incubation period is the time from when you come into contact with the flu virus to when you develop symptoms. On average, the flu incubation period lasts two days. You can walk around with the flu without knowing you are infected during that time. Unfortunately, that means you can unknowingly spread the virus to others. The flu incubation period is "a big reason why the flu is so easily spread," Kathryn Boling, MD, a family medicine specialist at Mercy Personal Physicians at Lutherville in Maryland, told Health. Read on to learn about the flu incubation period, including how long it lasts and if there's any way to know when you're in it. Guido Mieth / Getty Images What Is the Flu? Influenza, more commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory infection caused by several flu viruses. Those viruses infect the nose, lungs, and throat. The flu infects millions of people each year and causes thousands of hospitalizations and flu-related deaths. Anyone can get and spread the flu to others, even healthy people. The virus can be especially risky for certain groups, including: Adults older than 65 yearsChildren younger than 5 yearsPeople with chronic diseases (e.g., asthma, diabetes, and heart disease)Pregnant people When Should You Get the Flu Shot? How Does the Flu Spread? The flu is contagious and is transmitted from person to person through the air and infected surfaces. You can contract and spread the flu by coughing, sneezing, and talking. Droplets can spread as far as six feet away. You may come into contact with the flu by touching surfaces with live viruses, then touching your face. How Long Is the Incubation Period of the Flu? Suppose you pick up the flu from a friend who is sick. The incubation period is the time from when you hang out with your friend to when you start showing symptoms. There's no exact time frame that's the same for every person with the flu. Generally, the flu incubation period can range between one and four days. The average length is two days. Unfortunately, you cannot tell when you are in the flu incubation period. The only way to know when your incubation period was is when you have symptoms after exposure to the virus, said Dr. Boling. Most people are infected without knowing it. "Generally, the flu is only recognized once symptoms develop," Erik Blutinger, MD, an assistant professor of emergency medicine physician at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told Health. "The incubation period isn't easily detected." When Is the Flu Contagious? You are most contagious three to four days after flu symptoms appear. That contagious period can coincide with the incubation period. Your body responds to the virus as soon as you come into contact with it. That happens through your innate immune system, or the immunity you were born with. Your innate immune system helps keep harmful germs from entering your body. Symptoms appear once the virus passes your innate immune system and has time to multiply in your body. Most healthy adults may be able to infect others starting the day before they show symptoms and continue to be infectious up to seven days after they become sick. "People have the flu and are out and about doing their regular stuff, coming into contact with others before they get sick," said Dr. Boling. "You can infect plenty of people during that time." Flu Symptoms People with the flu may develop early symptoms like: Body achesChillsCoughFatigueFeverHeadachesNauseaRunny or stuffy noseSore throatVomiting Typically, those symptoms appear suddenly and go away within seven to 10 days. Some evidence suggests symptoms peak around three to four days after the illness begins. Of note: Symptoms of the flu resemble many other illnesses, like allergies, a cold, and COVID-19. Consider consulting a healthcare provider to get confirmation of a flu diagnosis. 8 Illnesses That Cause Flu-Like Symptoms That Aren’t the Flu Contact a healthcare provider if your symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, such as: Feeling confused or dizzyImbalanceNot urinatingPain or pressure in your abdomen or chestSeizuresSevere muscle painTrouble breathingWeaknessWorsening symptoms of underlying chronic illnesses Those may be signs that you are developing flu-related complications like pneumonia, or an infection of the lungs. A Quick Review Whether you figure out your incubation period, there are methods to prevent contracting and spreading the flu. An annual flu vaccine is one of the most effective ways to protect against the flu. Covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and washing your hands help keep germs from spreading. Those methods go a long way toward ensuring your incubation period does not affect anyone else. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

Humane Rescue Alliance and Prince George's County's Animal Shelter had to close their doors temporarily due to canine influenza. In just the last two weeks, both the D.C. Humane Rescue Alliance and Prince George’s County’s Animal Shelter had to close their doors temporarily due to canine influenza. Vets say it’s all part of a larger outbreak in the area, which might not be going away any time soon. “Most of the time it causes upper respiratory tract symptoms,” said Dr. Carole Foster, a vet with Nebel St. Animal Hospital in Rockville, Maryland. Foster said canine flu didn’t used to be much of a problem in the region, but “last winter, we did have an outbreak of the flu in our area for the first time, well, ever.” Since then, the virus, which is spread through contact — very similar to how humans acquire the flu — has been a much bigger problem. Foster said canine flu is especially contagious and can spread easily, which is why recent shelter closures have made sense. “It’s easy to catch, especially in dogs that are in close contact in facilities like kennels, shelters, boarding facilities — things like that,” she explained. “You need to disinfect the clinics, which can take as long as a week or two to get rid of what’s on surfaces or in the air.” Foster said another big reason why canine flu has been more prevalent in the D.C. region could be the fact that the vaccine for it is on a nationwide manufacturer back order. “We’ve been having difficulty getting the vaccine into dogs because of lack of availability,” said Foster. Most times, Foster said, symptoms in dogs aren’t severe, and the virus usually goes away on its own. “Occasionally though, you will have those dogs that become very ill, just like you do with people,” she said. More severe cases sometimes require antibiotics or anti-cough medications. Foster said the best thing you can do is monitor your dog’s breathing, coughing and appetite, and look for things like a runny nose or eyes. If you’re unsure whether your dog might have a bad case, simply call your local veterinarian. “I do expect I might see more cases of it in the next weeks or so,” Foster said.

By combining transcriptomics, proteomics and recombinant viruses we show that all tested strains of IAV, including A/PR/8/34(H1N1) (PR8) and A/Cal/07/2009 (H1N1) (Cal09), cause APA. We mapped the effect to the highly conserved glycine residue at position 184 (G184) of the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1). Unbiased mass spectrometry-based analyses indicate that NS1 causes APA by perturbing the function of CPSF4 and that this function is unrelated to virus-induced transcriptional shutoff. Accordingly, IAV strain PR8, expressing an NS1 variant with weak CPSF binding, does not induce host shutoff but only APA. However, recombinant IAV (PR8) expressing NS1(G184R) lacks binding to CPSF4 and thereby also the ability to cause APA. Functionally, the impaired ability to induce APA leads to an increased inflammatory cytokine production and an attenuated phenotype in a mouse infection model. Investigating diverse viral infection models showed that APA induction is a frequent ability of many pathogens. Collectively, we propose that targeting of the CPSF complex, leading to widespread alternative polyadenylation of host transcripts, constitutes a general immunevasion mechanism employed by a variety of pathogenic viruses.

Two currently circulating subtypes, A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), are responsible for the majority of annual influenza virus epidemics causing 5 million cases of severe illness leading to up to 650.000 deaths per year worldwide. Synergistic activation of innate and adaptive immune responses is required to prevent severe disease and clear the viral infection.The best characterized immune-modulating factor of IAV is the non-structural protein 1 (NS1)1. NS1 exerts various strain- and species-specific functions counteracting the host’s immune responses2,3, which is in line with the concept that viral targeting of the host’s defenses on several levels is beneficial for the virus4,5,6. NS1 contains two major structural domains, the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD), and the C-terminal effector domain (ED). The NS1-RBD is best described for its ability to inhibit innate immunity mediated signaling cascades through limiting the detection of viral RNA (vRNA) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as RIG-I7,8,9,10, protein kinase R11,12 and oligoadenylate synthetase13. Mechanistically, this activity is mediated through direct NS1-PRR or NS1-vRNA interactions, preventing the detection of vRNA. The NS1-ED serves as an interaction domain with multiple functions including inhibition of mRNA export through binding of the mRNA export receptor NXF1-NXT114, activation of PI3K, and direct inhibition of PKR2. In addition, most IAV strains encode for NS1 that potently interacts with cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 4 (CPSF4, CPSF30), which results in reduced mRNA maturation and thereby blunts cellular antiviral responses15,16. Previous structural characterization showed that this interaction is dependent on two distinct motifs in the NS1-ED - amino acid residues surrounding positions F103/M106 and G18416,17. Of note, some widely studied virus isolates, such as A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) and the pandemic A/California/07/2009 H1N1 (Cal09), were proposed not to interact with CPSF4 due to amino acid substitutions within NS1 at positions 103/106 and 108/125/189, respectively5,18.RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity, as well as mRNA production and maturation in general, are required for most cellular responses including the host’s antiviral defense. For this reason, many viruses besides IAV target this fundamental process to facilitate virus replication and transmission. Examples include orthomyxoviruses (e.g. Thogotovirus (THOV) targets TFIIB19), bunyaviruses (e.g. Rift valley fever virus (RVFV) depletes TFIIH20, La Crosse virus (LACV) degrades POLR2A21), togaviruses (e.g. Semliki forest virus (SFV) also degrades POLR2A22), picornaviruses (e.g. enterovirus 71 degrades CSTF223) and herpesviruses (e.g. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) targets the CPSF complex24). It was previously observed that IAV infection leads to RNAPII depletion from gene bodies, transcription downstream of physiological gene transcripts and chromatin rearrangement in the intergenic regions25,26. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms causing these phenomena and their potential involvement in immunopathology and disease progression remains incompletely understood.Post-transcriptional mRNA processing is absolutely essential for correct gene expression. Post-transcriptional changes, including alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA), were previously associated with a large number of pathologies27,28,29, including a number of virus infections30,31,32. The role of AS was recently specifically explored in the context of IAV infection33,34. IAV infection also results in formation of chromatin-bound “downstream of gene” transcripts (DoGs), which are considered to be polyadenylated25,35,36, but the mechanism of their formation and their role in the virus infection are not well understood. polyA site selection can be modulated by a variety of proteins, including the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor complex and a variety of RNA-binding proteins such as ELAVL137 (HuR) and hnRNPC38. Notably, APA not only influences gene expression patterns27,39,40, but can also impact and direct mRNA and protein localization41,42. Efficient targeting of post-transcriptional events by small molecules or antisense oligonucleotides was recently demonstrated43,44,45,46, highlighting mRNA processing as potential therapeutic target.Using deep RNA sequencing (RNAseq), we show that IAV strain PR8 causes major changes of the polyadenylation landscape in human cells. Using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)-validated APA events, we show that all tested strains of IAV, with an exception of a deletion variant lacking NS1, perturb the polyadenylation site usage in infected cells. Unbiased affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry-based analysis indicated that, surprisingly, the NS1-ED of all tested IAV strains cause APA by disturbing the function of the CPSF complex. NS1 binding to the CPSF complex critically relies on a single glycine residue at position 184 (G184) that is conserved in all IAV strains sequenced to date. The enrichment of the CPSF complex in NS1 immunoprecipitations is fine-tuned by residues at and around positions 103 and 106, which vary among clinically relevant IAV strains and adjust the degree of transcriptional shutoff during infection. High enrichment of CPSF4 seemingly favors insurmountable RNAPII termination defects, whereas low enrichment leads to a widespread production of mature mRNAs containing elongated 3’UTRs. Notably, the ability to cause APA correlates with inhibition of inflammatory cytokine induction, including IL-6 and IFN-γ in vitro, ex vivo and in lungs of infected mice. Functionally, this low CPSF enrichment correlates with viral pathogenicity in a mouse IAV infection model. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the benefits of pharmaceutical targeting of the CPSF interaction surface of NS1 are highly relevant for all IAV strains including the 2009 pandemic strain, and thus contribute to mechanistic characterization of this potentially pan-IAV targeting strategy.ResultsIAV causes extensive APA of host transcriptsTo evaluate IAV-induced transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes to the host transcriptome, we performed a deep transcriptomics study of the human lung carcinoma cell line A549, infected for 24 h with IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8). Compared to mock-infected cells we observed 777 and 555 significantly up- and down-regulated genes, respectively (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a, Supplementary Data 1). Moreover, analysis of alternative polyadenylation (APA) of host transcripts47 revealed notable changes, with 3’UTRs of 119 and 18 host genes significantly lengthened or shortened, respectively (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1a, b, Supplementary Data 2). mRNA isoform usage analysis48,49 identified only 12 and 20 significant alternative splicing events, occurring in 3’UTRs and coding regions (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Data 3). Interestingly, genes affected by APA upon IAV infection significantly overlap with genes reported to be APA-ed across seven tumor types from tumor-normal tissue pairs in the TCGA dataset28 (Supplementary Fig. 1c), suggesting that the IAV-induced APA might correlate mechanistically and/or functionally with APA occurring in cancer. This notion was further supported by the identification of intron- and 3’UTR-located APA events in cancer-related genes, such as TP53, HEXIM1 and TFAP2A (Supplementary Fig. 1d, e). Based on this transcriptome-wide analysis, we selected a subset of APA genes as reference markers for IAV-induced APA (Supplementary Fig. 1d). In order to test for the APA of specific genes, we implemented an RT-qPCR based test to quantify the usage of polyadenylation sites (Fig. 1b). To visualize thus acquired measurements, we use percentage of distal polyA site usage index (PDUI, log2, higher values indicate elongated transcripts) and the difference between PDUIs of treated (e.g. infected) versus untreated (e.g. mock) samples (ΔPDUI, log2, higher values indicate more elongated transcripts relative to control). To investigate if induction of APA is a conserved function of IAV, we analyzed APA fingerprints of various strains of IAV. Towards this, we infected A549 cells with IAV strains PR8, A/WSN/1933 H1N1 (WSN), A/seal/Mass/1-SC35M/1980 H7N7 (SC35M)50, and SC35MΔNS151, or left them uninfected (mock), and performed RT-qPCR based quantification of APA at multiple times post infection. We observed that infection with all tested wild-type strains of IAV recapitulated APA of selected (Fig. 1c), but not unrelated (Supplementary Fig. 2a) genes. A notable exception was the NS1-deleted strain SC35MΔNS1 (Fig. 1c), which did not show any signs of APA, indicating that the NS1 protein may be responsible for the APA occurring in IAV infected cells. The comparably high abundance of viral transcripts in all conditions indicated that APA was not simply due to reduced infection rates of SC35MΔNS1 (Supplementary Fig. 2a).Fig. 1: Influenza A causes widespread alternative polyadenylation of host transcripts.a Overview of transcriptional and post-transcriptional deregulation of host-transcripts, induced by infection of A549 cells with IAV strain PR8 for 24 h at MOI 3.

RNA integrity was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis and uniform fractionation of HIST3H3 protein and U6 snRNA in the nuclear fractions indicated successful fractionation (Supplementary Fig. 2c). For evaluation of differential 3’UTR usage, reverse transcription was performed using (dT)18 primer (Supplementary Fig. 2b). In line with our previous findings, we observed significant elongation of transcripts’ 3’UTRs in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of cells infected with wild-type but not ΔNS1 mutant virus (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2d). Interestingly, for all measured transcripts the nuclear fractions in all conditions, including uninfected, contained on average mRNA with longer 3’UTRs compared to the cytoplasmic fractions. Whether this is limited to observed transcripts or represents a more general phenomenon has yet to be explored. While these experiments do not exclude the presence of abortive transcripts, these results showed that the mRNA affected by IAV-induced APA are properly polyadenylated and exported into the cytoplasm.To exclude that IAV-induced APA is cell line specific, we performed corresponding infection experiments using the human cell line HEK293T, resulting in similar findings in regard to elongation of host transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Moreover, we investigated APA of host transcripts upon infection of primary human tracheobronchial airway epithelial cells (hTAECs), a widely used ex vivo infection model for IAV52. Upon infection of hTAECs with strains PR8 and A/California/07/2009 H1N1 (Cal09), which do not induce host shutoff18, we again detected elongation of host transcripts (Fig. 1e). Additionally, infection of immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with IAV strain PR8 reproduced APA as observed for homologous human transcripts indicating that the observed APA in IAV infected cells is not species specific (Supplementary Fig. 2f).Collectively, we showed that IAV infection-mediated APA is a conserved phenomenon for all tested IAV strains with the exception of a strain deleted for viral protein NS1. APA of host transcripts occurred in human and murine cell lines as well as primary human airway epithelial cells infected with different IAV strains.APA of host transcript is dependent on the C-terminal CPSF4-binding epitope of NS1Given that NS1-deleted IAV failed to induce APA, we hypothesized that the expression of NS1 may be sufficient to reproduce APA in the absence of viral infection. We therefore transfected an expression plasmid encoding PR8-derived NS1 into HEK293T cells and quantified APA by qPCR, taking along multiple other viral dsRNA binding proteins as additional controls. We found that expression of NS1, by itself, was sufficient to reproduce the APA of selected transcripts as observed in IAV infection (Fig. 2a). To narrow down which domain of NS1 is required for this, we individually expressed the full-length NS1 protein as well as its two domains, the RNA binding (RBD) and the effector (ED) domains (Fig. 2b). Notably, expression of the ED, but not of RBD, was sufficient to induce APA of host transcripts (Fig. 2c).Fig. 2: Alternative polyadenylation of host transcripts is mediated by viral protein NS1 irrespective of amino-acids at positions 103/106 and abrogated by G184R mutation.a Depicted viral proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells via expression plasmid transfection (or transfection reagent only, vehicle), followed by quantification of APA of selected genes.

ΔCt values were calculated relative to the housekeeping gene RPLP0.Full size imageThe molecular mechanisms of innate immune response inhibition by NS1 are strain-dependent, and its robustness is achieved by concerted activity of both the RNA-binding and the effector domains2. Most strains rely on disabling the activity of the CPSF complex by binding the CPSF4, thus causing transcriptional shutoff5,15,18. CPSF4 is one of the central proteins mediating polyA site selection53, and binding of NS1 to it could potentially explain the APA observed in IAV. However, some of the strains that induce APA, but not transcriptional host shutoff, namely PR8 and Cal09, are considered not to interact with CPSF complex5,18. This interaction is facilitated by a bipartite motif on the effector domain composed of residues 103 and 106 and their surroundings, and the residue 18417. The presence of amino acid residues F103 and M106 is required, but not sufficient, for host-cell shutoff caused by CPSF4 sequestration5,18. Interestingly, while amino acid residues at positions 103 and 106 vary substantially between IAV strains, the G184 residue is highly conserved (Fig. 2d).To test the potential involvement of the CPSF-binding motifs of NS1 in IAV-induced APA, we constructed expression plasmids encoding full length PR8-derived NS1 or variants harboring mutations in N- and C-terminal CPSF4-binding motifs (Fig. 2b) following previously established naming scheme5. Strikingly, upon transfection of these ED variants we observed that the occurrence of APA was independent of the amino acids at positions 103 and 106 (Fig. 2e). Notably, however, the occurrence of APA required the C-terminal CPSF-binding residue G184. Interestingly, the molecular relevance of this residue in IAV strain PR8 is currently unknown, but was shown to determine virulence in vivo5. To further corroborate results from the transfection based system, we used recombinant PR8-based virus mutants5 to infect A549 cells. In line with results obtained by delivering isolated NS1 constructs in trans, induction of APA was dependent on the glycine at position 184 but independent of the amino acids at positions 103 and 106 (Fig. 2f).Taken together, APA caused by IAV can be recapitulated by expression of NS1 in the absence of virus infection. The induction of APA does not depend on the presence of specific amino acids at positions 103/106 of NS1, which were previously considered to be key residues dictating the NS1-CPSF4 interaction. However, the ED of NS1, specifically G184, is required for induction of APA. This was highly unexpected because this epitope was previously not associated to any virus-host interactions in the IAV strain PR8.NS1 of all tested influenza A virus strains interact with the CPSF complexIn order to identify G184-dependent interactions of NS1 and thus the potential molecular reason of APA of host transcripts, we performed affinity purification coupled to liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (AP-LC-MS/MS) of exogenously (plasmid) expressed HA-tagged NS1 proteins and their effector domains in human cells (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Data 4). Based on enrichment of potential interactors of full length and ED-only constructs, we divided the interactors into ED-specific and RBD-dependent interactors for constructs with distinct N-terminal CPSF4-binding epitopes at positions 103/106 (Fig. 3a). Among the RBD-dependent interactors were many dsRNA-binding proteins, which were highly conserved between NS1 proteins with different amino acid residues at positions 103 and 106 (Fig. 3b). In stark contrast, we observe major differences in composition of ED-specific interactors between NS1 proteins, indicating that amino acids at positon 103/106 act as major determinants of ED molecular activity (Fig. 3b). Unexpectedly, we observed significant enrichment of the CPSF complex components in AP-LC-MS/MS of NS1 proteins regardless of the amino acid composition at positions 103 and 106 (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 3a). However, enrichment of CPSF complex components was substantially higher for constructs containing F/M as opposed to S/I residues at positions 103/106, suggesting that residues at these positions regulate affinity for the CPSF complex (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 3a). Further analysis revealed that CPSF4 is the only ED interactor significant changing binding specificity in line with the ability of NS1 to induce APA of host transcripts (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 3b). In order to corroborate the MS-based findings, we co-transfected expression plasmids encoding GFP-tagged CPSF4 and HA-tagged NS1 (PR8) with or without the G184R mutation in HEK293T cells and performed anti-HA immunoprecipitations. CPSF4 co-precipitated with wild-type NS1 from PR8, but not with the same NS1 harboring a G184R mutation (Fig. 3d). In sum, these findings show that NS1 from IAV strain PR8 retains some affinity towards the CPSF complex, which may be driving the observed APA of host transcripts but is insufficient to cause host shutoff.Fig. 3: Interaction between NS1 and the CPSF complex is diminished by variation of amino acids at positions 103/106, but only completely abrogated by variation at position 184.a Schematic representation of HA-tagged constructs used in AP-MS experiments. b Schematic representation of RBD- and ED-dependent interaction partners of NS1 proteins depending on amino acids at positions 103/106. c Normalized IBAQ-based log2 enrichment (ΔIBAQN) of depicted preys in comparison between R/SI/G (y-axis) and R/FG/G (x-axis) with control bait (CTR – ThoV M).

Statistics were calculated using two-sided equal variance t-test. n.s. p > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.Full size imageIn order to functionally test the involvement of CPSF4 in IAV-induced APA, we performed depletion of CPSF4 in human and mouse cell lines using siRNA and shRNA, respectively. In line with expected results that CPSF4 is critical for proper cleavage and polyadenylation25,54, we show that CPSF4 depletion recapitulates lengthening of the hallmark transcripts that are lengthened in an NS1-dependent manner upon IAV infection (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 3c). These observations are supportive of disturbance of CPSF4 by NS1 being at the center of the molecular mechanism leading to APA of host transcripts during IAV infection.Contrary to our previous understanding of IAV, we show that the NS1 proteins from various influenza A strains are able to interact with the CPSF complex with different affinities tuned by amino acids at position 103/106, and absolutely requiring the amino acid residue G at position 184. APA of host transcripts, occurring during IAV infection in an NS1 G184-dependent manner, can be recapitulated in an orthogonal manner by depleting CPSF4 in cell lines of both human and murine origin, further highlighting the CPSF complex as central driver of IAV-induced APA.IAV-induced APA of host transcripts occurs independently of viral host shutoffAPA of host transcripts and viral host shutoff caused by IAV are mechanistically related events centered on NS1-based perturbation of the CPSF complex. In order to gain better understanding of their delineation, we investigated to what degree they co-occur depending on the nature of amino acids in CPSF4-binding epitopes of NS1. Towards this, we performed full proteome analysis of the human cell line A549 infected with IAV encoding amino acid variations at positions 103/106 and 184 of NS1 (Fig. 2b). Overall, we detected over 6700 host proteins, over 6000 of which were stably quantified and included in the proteomic analysis (Supplementary Data 6). Dimensionality reduction revealed clear separation of proteome signatures based on the IAV strain used for infection, with an observed tendency for strains interacting with CPSF complex and inducing APA to cluster separately from strains harboring a G184R mutation that abrogates this activity (Fig. 4a). In line with previous evidence5, we do not observe any differences in viral protein accumulation between strains, supportive of uniform virus infectivity in vitro (Fig. 4b). However, the effect of infection with different strains on host protein abundances, in particular when comparing the effect of the G184R mutation on various backgrounds, is markedly different. We observe only a small number of differentially expressed proteins between wild-type and G184R mutant PR8 strains (Fig. 4c). In stark contrast, upon comparison of strains harboring F/M residues in the N-terminal CPSF4-binding epitope of NS1, we observe reduced abundance of a large subset of cellular proteins (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 3d). This evidence is supportive of the hypothesis that postulates the existence of low (S103/I106/G184) and high (F103/M106/G184) affinity CPSF4-binding epitopes, with low-affinity binding being sufficient to induce APA and high-affinity binding causing host shutoff.Fig. 4: Amino acid positions 103 and 106 dictate the occurrence of host shutoff effect but not APA.a–g A549 cells were infected with indicated strains of IAV (MOI 3) for 24 h and used for proteome quantification using LC-MS/MS. a 2-dimensional representation of sample similarity, depicted through the use of uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). b Heatmap depicting mean abundances of viral proteins upon infection with indicated viruses. c Plot depicting numbers of significantly up- and down-regulated proteins in comparison between indicated conditions. d Volcano plots showing log2 fold-changes and associated unadjusted p-values between indicated conditions.

Statistical analysis was performed using two-sample one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing log2 fold-changes between individual indicated conditions with mock (e.g. R/SI/G – mock and R/SI/R – mock). f Plots depict scaled densities of log2 fold changes between indicated conditions for proteins belonging to the GO-term defense response to virus (GOBP:0051607). g Plots depict densities of protein changes between indicated conditions for all proteins (gray), proteins encoded by genes included in APA analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1b, Supplementary Data 2) (orange), and protein encoded by genes that are significantly APA in IAV infection (pink).Full size imageThis notion is further corroborated by additional analyses considering protein expression on a continuous distribution. We could observe a clear global protein downregulation for all strains encoding NS1 proteins that highly enrich for CPSF4 in immunoprecipitations (Fig. 4d, e). In order to visualize the repressive activity of NS1 on the proteome, we plotted the cumulative density functions depicting the distribution of protein expression changes between different strains (Fig. 4e). As expected, we observed heavy-tailed distributions towards negative values when comparing G184R-dependent profiles from strains harboring F/M but not S/I amino acids at positions 103/106. This is indicative of global repression of protein expression resulting from transcriptional host shutoff in G184-encoding strains containing FM residues at N-terminal CPSF4-binding epitope versus their G184R mutant counterparts (Fig. 4e). Given that the main function of NS1 is regulation of cellular antiviral responses, we focused more closely on expression of interferon response related proteins in cells infected with IAV bearing different NS1 mutations (Fig. 4f). The PR8 wild type strain (R/SI/G; wt, dsRNA binding, low CPSF enrichment) moderately induced expression of cellular antiviral defense proteins and this induction was similar when we used a virus with a single mutation in G184R (R/SI/R; dsRNA binding, no CPSF binding) (Fig. 4f). This is in line with the central function of the dsRNA binding domain in PR8 to suppress innate immune responses that alleviates the requirement for high affinity binding to the CPSF complex5,55. As expected, recombinant viruses expressing NS1 (R/FM/G; wt, dsRNA and high enrichment of CPSF4) or NS1 (A/FM/G; dsRNA binding mutant, high enrichment of CPSF4) similarly suppressed induction of innate immune responses, which is in line with the notion that high efficiency binding of NS1 to the CPSF complex alleviates the requirement for dsRNA binding2,5 (Fig. 4f, Supplementary Data 5). In contrast, the G184R mutation on an R/FM/ or A/FM/ NS1 background profoundly de-repressed the stringent inhibition of antiviral responses mediated by the host shutoff (Fig. 4f). These data further support the key role of 103F/106M CPSF binding motif in perturbing cellular protein expression networks and underline the importance of G184 residue in this activity. We further posed the question if APA impacts the expression patterns of proteins encoded by the affected genes (Fig. 4g). We found that the expression patterns of proteins expressed from the APA genes do not substantially deviate from the background (Fig. 4g), which strongly indicates that the APA occurring during IAV/PR8 infection does not directly hamper protein production. Presented findings support the prior observations that the host shutoff induced by IAV requires strong interaction between NS1 and the host CPSF complex and that weak interaction between NS1 and the CPSF complex is unable to cause substantial host shutoff although it is sufficient to induce perturbation in mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation patterns. Moreover, this data indicates that APA does not have a profound effect on protein expression patterns.Collectively, we show that while APA occurs upon infection of human cells with IAV strains regardless of amino acids at position 103/106, while the host shutoff, characterized by repressed expression of innate immunity related proteins as well as global repression of host protein expression in general, only occurs upon infection with strains encoding F/M amino acids at these positions. These results support the hypothesis that high efficacy binding between NS1 and CPSF4 in the context of IAV infection leads to host shutoff and APA of host transcripts, whereas low efficacy binding results exclusively in APA.Abrogation of IAV-induced APA correlates with attenuation of the virus and reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokinesThe G184R mutation has a pronounced effect on virulence of the PR8 virus in mice, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear5. Remarkably, virus replication, inhibition of the IFN response, protein localization5 and structure17 are not perturbed in vitro. This led us to hypothesize that the difference in virulence between the wild-type and mutant strains might result from differences in the interaction of infected primary target tissue with surrounding cell types, altering the secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. To explore the pathological differences between the strains in vivo, we infected B6 mice with wild-type PR8 and G184R mutant viruses and quantified cytokines and chemokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We observed no differences in the levels of cytokines or chemokines, nor viral titers, at one day post infection (Supplementary Data 6). However, at three days post infection, we observed significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ in BALF of G184R mutant virus-infected mice (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 4a). As expected5, viral loads in lung homogenates did not differ between wild-type and mutant virus at 3 days post infection (Fig. 5a). To identify pathophysiological differences, we performed histological evaluation of mouse lungs at 3 days post infection (Fig. 5b). Wild-type virus as opposed to the G184R mutant caused significantly enhanced bronchiolitis and pneumonia, indicating increased severity of the pathological state (Fig. 5b, c). In line with the outcome of the histological evaluation, mice infected with the G184R mutant virus survived the lethal infection for a significantly longer period of time (Fig. 5d).Fig. 5: IAV-induced APA of host transcripts inversely correlates with secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons.a C57BL/6J mice were infected with IAV strains R/SI/G or R/SI/R (10e5 pfu) or left uninfected. 3 days post infection we quantified secreted cytokines in BALF (left, Supplementary Data 6) and virus lung titers from lung homogenate supernatant (right). Selected significantly changing cytokines are shown alongside the virus titer; measurements from N = 8 (4 for mock-infection) mice are shown alongside mean +/− sd. Other significantly changing cytokines are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4a. b Mice were treated as in a, with FFPE lung samples used for histopathology evaluation.

In a and c, statistics were calculated using two-sided equal variance t-test. n.s. p > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.Full size imageIn sum, we show that the G184R mutant strain that lacks the ability to induce APA of host transcripts has remarkably reduced virulence in vivo relative to the parental PR8 strain, accompanied by higher secretion of cytokines and reduced pathology. While the molecular mechanism connecting the G184R mutation to enhanced cytokine secretion remains unclear, the superior tissue response in lungs is correlating with a reduced virulence of the G184R strain.IAV-induced APA of host transcripts inversely correlates with secretion of IL-6To corroborate the inverse correlation between IAV-induced APA of host transcripts and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we performed infection experiments with wild-type and G184R mutant viruses at different MOIs in vitro. We chose to focus on IL-6 as a widely accepted indicator of pro-inflammatory responses, which is also robustly regulated both on the level of secreted cytokine amount as well as mRNA abundance. Notably, in line with the in vivo data, infection of MEFs with the G184R mutant virus resulted in significantly higher IL-6 secretion as compared to the wild-type strain, which is also reflected at the transcript level (Fig. 6a). Moreover, we observed enhanced levels of secreted IL-6 in the human A549 cell line, infected with the G184R mutant virus at MOI 3 for 18 h (Fig. 6b). To further confirm the inverse correlation between IAV-induced APA of host transcripts and IL-6 secretion, we recapitulated APA by depletion of CPSF4 in MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 4b) using shRNA and infected them with the G184R mutant virus. CPSF4 depletion did not affect cell viability as compared to control shRNA treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Notably, however, we observed a clear reduction of IL-6 secretion (Fig. 6c). These data link the activity of the CPSF complex to cytokine production and/or secretion.Fig. 6: APA-deficient IAV strain induced IL-6 secretion is RIG-I and MAVS dependent and can be circumvented by concomitant CPSF4 knock-down.a Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were infected with indicated strains of IAV at various MOIs (x-axis) for 24 h, followed by quantification of (left) secreted IL-6 by ELISA, IL-6 mRNA (middle) and viral transcripts M and NS1 (right) by RT-qPCR for two separately infected wells. The presented data is representative of 2 independent repeats and shown alongside mean. ΔCt values were calculated relative to the housekeeping gene ACTB. b A549 cells were infected with indicated strains of IAV at MOI 3 for 24 h, followed by quantification of secreted IL-6 by ELISA for three separately infected wells, shown here alongside mean +/− sd. The presented data is representative of 3 independent repeats. c MEFs (3 independent wells) were transfected with shRNA targeting Cpsf4 or Hnrnpc (CTR) 1 day prior to infection with R/SI/R at MOI 3. 24 h post infection, secreted IL-6 was quantified by ELISA (left) and viral transcript M abundance by RT-qPCR, shown here alongside mean +/− sd. Further related data is presented in Supplementary Fig. 4b. The presented data is representative of 2 independent repeats. ΔCt values were calculated relative to the housekeeping gene ACTB. d RIG-I (left), MAVS (middle) and STING (right) KOs were used alongside respective wt controls and either infected with indicated IAV strains (MOI 3) or treated with indicated stimuli (IVT4 in vitro transcript 4, RIG-I ligand74, LPS lipopolysaccharide, TLR4 ligand, dsDNA double-stranded DNA, STING ligand). 24-h post infectionreatment, secreted IL-6 was quantified by ELISA for 3 independently processed wells and shown alongside mean +/− sd. The presented data is representative of 2 independent repeats. Statistics were calculated using two-sided equal variance t-test. n.s. p > 0.05, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.Full size imageTo delineate which pattern recognition receptor (PRR) marks the starting point of the inflammatory cascade leading to the observed immunomodulatory phenotype, we performed infections of MEFs carrying mutations in RIG-I, MAVS or STING with the wild-type or G184R mutant virus for 24 h, followed by quantification of secreted IL-6. The increase in IL-6 secretion in response to the mutant virus was largely dependent on RIG-I and MAVS, but independent of STING (Fig. 6d). These findings strongly indicate the existence of an inverse correlation between the ability of IAV to induce APA of host transcripts and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 resulting from RIG-I activation upstream of the MAVS signaling cascade.APA of host transcripts is observed after infection of human cells with several different virusesThe striking evolutionary conservation of the NS1-CPSF interaction in IAV strains led us to hypothesize that other, unrelated viruses could also employ APA towards a similar immunomodulatory effect. To test this hypothesis, we infected the human A549 cell line with a spectrum of viruses belonging to different virus families and evaluated polyadenylation patterns of genes affected by IAV. Notably, several viruses induced APA (Fig. 7a, Supplementary Fig. 5a). SFV and HSV-1 infections recapitulated the IAV-induced APA fingerprint, while RVFV (clone 13) and LACV, both members of the order Bunyavirales, caused a less pronounced APA signature. In contrast, other viruses tested, including Thogoto virus (THOV), Vesicular stomoatitis virus (VSV), Zika virus (ZIKV) and Vaccinia virus (VACV), did not cause appreciable APA of the assayed transcripts.Fig. 7: Host transcriptional and in particular polyadenylation machinery is a common target point of pathogenic viruses.a A549 cells were infected with indicated viruses at MOI 1 for 24 h, followed by quantification of APA of depicted host transcripts. ΔPDUI as a measure of APA status is shown alongside mean for 2 separately infected wells. Further related data is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a. SFV Semliki Forest Virus, HSV1 Herpes Simplex Virus 1, LACV La Crosse encephalitis Virus, RVFV Rift Valley Fever Virus, THOV Thogotovirus, VACV Vaccinia virus, VSV Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, ZIKV Zika Virus. b THP-1 cells were left uninfected or infected with SFV at MOI 1 for 24 h, followed by LC-MS/MS based quantification of protein abundances. Protein abundance changes between infected and uninfected conditions for selected transcription-related complex components is depicted. Further related data is presented in Supplementary Fig. 5b, c. c Schematic representation of viral targeting strategies centered on the host transcriptional machinery and its interface with the complexes involved in cleavage and polyadenylation.Full size imageInterestingly, HSV-1 has been shown to interact with CPSF complex through ICP2724, leading to transcription beyond termination sites observed to be used under physiological conditions24,56,57, which may rationalize the APA fingerprint observed herein. RVFV NSm was shown to interact with CPSF2 in a yeast two hybrid system58, but this interaction, to the best of our knowledge, was never been tested in the context of mammalian cells. LACV causes degradation of POLR2A in a CTD phosphorylation pattern dependent manner21 which is a shared activity with SFV, which also causes degradation of RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2A in mammalian cells22. However, perturbation of cleavage and polyadenylation patterns by SFV and LACV, which interfere with POLR2A stability, was highly unexpected. In order to explore the molecular pathways leading to SFV-induced APA, we performed full proteome analysis of mock- and SFV-infected human cell line THP1 (Supplementary Data 7). We stably quantified over 5000 host proteins, including RNAPII complex components and the complexes it interacts with through its CTD encoded by POLR2A. As expected, the abundance of RNAPII complex components, including POLR2A, was reduced, leading us to hypothesize that the degradation of POLR2A might extend to its interacting partners (Fig. 7b). Notably, we also identified a reduction in abundance of the CPSF complex components upon SFV infection as compared to mock, which was especially prominent for WDR33 (Fig. 7b, Supplementary Fig. 5b). We additionally validated these MS-based findings by WB, where we showed approximately 2-fold reduction in abundance of CPSF complex components CPSF3 and CPSF4 upon SFV infection of A549 cell line for 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 5c). It is possible that the reduction in abundance of these proteins underlies the SFV-induced APA. In summary, we demonstrate that perturbation of the cellular mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation machinery influencing polyadenylation patterns of host transcripts is a common occurrence accompanying infection of human cell lines with a wide spectrum of viruses that potentially achieve it through distinct molecular mechanisms (Fig. 7c).DiscussionWe characterized APA patterns upon IAV infection of human cells and showed correlation of APA with inhibition of host cytokines in vitro and in vivo, providing a possible explanation for the previously observed decrease in virulence of G184R mutant PR8 strain5. We found that NS1 is required and sufficient to induce APA of host transcripts in the presence as well as in absence of IAV infection. We revealed that NS1 proteins of all tested IAV strains maintain either high or low enrichment of the CPSF complex in immunoprecipitation experiments. Based on the presented results we propose a hypothesis that high enrichment of the CPSF complex by NS1 leads to APA, inhibition of the cell intrinsic innate immune responses and transcriptional host shutoff, while low CPSF enrichment causes APA but no strong inhibition of the cell intrinsic innate immune response or host shutoff. We further show that the epitope involved in modulating the NS1-CPSF4 enrichment plays a pivotal role in virus attenuation in vivo, accompanied by increased secretion of type II IFN and NF-kB-dependent cytokines.It is currently unclear which genes or genetic elements that are affected by CPSF complex inhibition are responsible for the observed altered cytokine regulation. Moreover, an overshooting pro-inflammatory response was previously associated with severe disease progression59; how the altered cytokine expression patterns observed in vivo cause a less pronounced pathology and attenuate disease progression is yet to be elucidated. However, we have molecularly located this IAV-mediated inhibition and further established that the APA pattern caused by IAV infection can also be found in cells infected with other, unrelated viruses. We show that, among the viruses included in this study, APA caused by HSV-1 and SFV closely resembles that of the IAV. While one could envision similar molecular mechanisms – i.e. the CPSF complex targeted by IAV and HSV-124,60, there was so far no clear connection between SFV and transcriptional termination. We here provide evidence that the abundances of RNAPII CTD-associated CPSF and CFIIm complexes involved in cleavage and polyadenylation are reduced in SFV infected cells, which may point towards a conserved mechanism leading to APA.Beyond IAV, HSV-1 and SFV, two members of bunyaviridae family, RVFV and LACV, also cause a similar yet apparently distinct APA signature. LACV protein NSs was previously shown to cause degradation of POLR2A in a CTD phosphorylation-dependent manner. RVFV is, however, not known to directly affect the function of RNAPII, but instead perturbs the activity of general transcription factor 2 H (TFIIH) through viral protein NSs. This interaction is not relevant in the case of the RVFV strain used in this work (RVFV clone 13), which harbors a deletion in the NSs protein, widely considered to result in production of a non-functional protein. An interaction between RVFV NSm protein and CPSF2 has been observed in a yeast 2 hybrid screen58. However, whether the interaction takes place in the context of infection in a mammalian cell setting remains to be elucidated. Presented evidence leads us to propose that these and potentially other viruses target a susceptible part of host mRNA post-transcriptional maturation machinery that is involved in immunomodulation through a so far unknown molecular mechanism.Long chromatin-bound downstream-of-gene transcripts35,61 (DoGs) were previously proposed to be caused by either NS1-dependent36 or independent25 mechanisms. The NS1-independent mechanism was proposed to be caused by cellular stress accompanying virus infections25, which may be hyperosmotic in nature25,61. Formation of DoGs during hyperosmotic shock was recently associated with loss of integrator complex from RNAPII62. Furthermore, hyperosmotic stress was recently shown to cause rapid sequestration of CPSF6 from the sites of active transcription into nuclear phase separated granules63. The phase separation of CPSF663 following hyperosmotic stress may in particular contribute to the high degree of correlation between DoGs previously observed in stressed and IAV-infected cells25 and may further contribute to the hyper-inflammatory landscape of pathophysiological hyperosmotic conditions64. While DoGs and RNAPII occupancy loss from gene bodies, a putative hallmark of transcriptional host-shutoff, were previously recognized as separate phenomena25, further studies are required to mechanistically and functionally delineate them. Moreover, the potential similarity between mechanisms of formation as well as biological functions of DoGs and APA transcripts in IAV infection remains to be elucidated.Alternative polyadenylation was associated to a number of biological functions such as tissue specific protein expression and proliferative potential of cells40,53,65,66. It was furthermore observed in numerous diseases, such as VSV infection32 and cancer27,39. Despite the association of APA with multiple pathologies, determination of causal relationships between distinct APA events and molecular disease progression is highly challenging. The main reasons for this are the limited power of detection of APA events for numerous poorly expressed transcripts (e.g. transcription factors and cytokines), limited correlation of APA with mRNA and protein expression, and the lack of methodology that would enable polyA site use modulation in follow-up studies. Another reason for this may be the complex regulatory nature of 3’UTRs. It was recently shown that mRNA 3’UTRs can not only impact its metabolism, but also mRNA and protein localization via 3’UTR-dependent mRNA sequestration into TIS-granule rich ER (TIGER) domains41,42. Protein translation in the TIGER domains was shown to be efficiently coupled to the plasma membrane directed transport, which provided the mechanistic basis for the mRNA 3’UTR-dependent protein localization41,42. However, protein localization changes and even abundance variations of scarcely expressed receptor proteins are difficult to capture on a global manner. Such changes may have a strong impact in inflammatory diseases such as virus infections, where disease course-determining processes are driven by dynamically localized proteins involved in cell-to-cell communication, para-, and autocrine signaling.Finally, the treatment potential of preventing the induction of APA by IAV or other viruses remains to be explored. Small molecule inhibitors of IAV NS1 targeting the G184 region, and in particular the NS1-CPSF4 interaction, were previously described67,68,69,70. Their in vitro phenotypes, in particular their strong ability to suppress PR8 replication in an interferon response dependent manner68, however do not fully overlap with the expectations from behavior of G184R mutant strains as observed by us and others5. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the benefits of pharmaceutical targeting of the CPSF interaction surface of NS1 are highly relevant for all IAV strains including the 2009 pandemic strain, and thus contribute to mechanistic characterization of this potentially pan-IAV targeting strategy. Our data also demonstrate that the main benefits of inhibiting the NS1-CPSF interaction only become visible in vivo, however, this may be to an extent strain-dependent. Furthermore, restoring the activity of the CPSF complex may be of therapeutic benefit against a broad spectrum of viruses.MethodsCells, plasmids and reagentsHEK293T, HeLa, A549, Vero E6 cells (CRL-1586, ATCC) and MEFs71 were grown under standard culturing conditions as described previously71. hTAECs were cultured as described previously52. For gene knock-down experiments, siRNA siGENOME reagents against human CPSF4 (M-012292-02) and non-targeting control (D-001206-14) were purchased from Horizon, PerkinElmer, and used as previously described71. shRNA against mouse CPSF3 (shRNA #1: CCAGCAAACCAGTGAATTTAT, shRNA #2: GCTGCATGACATACCCATTTA and shRNA#3: GCATGACATACCCATTTACTA), CPSF4 (shRNA #1: GCCATGTCTGTCCTTTCATTT, shRNA #2: CAGATGCACCAAAGGGCATTT and shRNA #3: CAGATGCACCAAAGGGCATTT) and hnRNPC (CTR; CCCTCTACTCAGTTCCTCATT and CAGTAGAGATGAAGAATGAAA) were used as described previously72. MEFs with genetic ablation of MAVS and STING, alongside wild-type controls, were a gift from Michael S. Diamond and Søren Riis Paludan, respectively. Production of lentiviruses, transduction of cells and antibiotic selection were performed as described previously73. All cell lines were tested to be mycoplasma-free. For stimulation of cells, dsRNA (Sigma, D1626), IVT474 and LPS (Sigma, L2630) were used. Transfection of plasmids was performed using polyethylenimine (PEI 25 K, Polysciences) – unless otherwise stated, medium exchange was performed 4-hours- and the cells were harvested 24-h post transfection. Transfection of other nucleic acids was performed using Metafectene Pro (Biontex). Expression plasmids harboring GFP-CPSF4, viral dsRNA binding proteins and NS1 mutants were prepared in pCAGGS backbone as previously described19. Resazurin reduction assay as a measure of cell viability was performed as described previously75.Virus strains, stock preparation and in vitro infectionUnless otherwise stated, the virus stocks were produced in Vero E6 cells as previously described73. IAV strains PR8, SC35M, SC35M dNS151, WSN and Cal0976 were described previously5. Recombinant IAV strains, produced in chicken eggs, R/SI/G, R/SI/R, R/FM/G, R/FM/R, A/FM/G and A/FM/R were a gift from Georg Kochs5. SFV77, HSV-1 (gift from Søren Riis Paludan), LACV and RVFV (gift from Friedemann Weber), ThoV19, VacV MVA78, VSV79, ZIKV72 were previously described.Cells were washed with PBS prior to addition of infectious inoculum (unless otherwise stated at MOI 3) diluted in ice-cold PBS. Cells were incubated for 1 h on ice prior to removal of inoculum and warm medium replacement. At the time of sample harvest, the cells were washed once with 1x PBS buffer and lysed in LBP (Macherey-Nagel) or 1x SSB lysis buffer (62.5 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8; 2% SDS; 10% glycerol; 50 mM DTT; 0.01% bromophenol blue) for RT-qPCR or western blot analyses, respectively. The samples were heat-inactivated and frozen at −80 °C until further processing. Sampled supernatants were stored frozen at −80 °C until further processing.Plaque assaysConfluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells were infected with serial five-fold dilutions of virus supernatants (from 1:100 to 1:7812500) for 1 h at 37 °C. The inoculum was removed and replaced with serum-free MEM (Gibco, Life Technologies) containing 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich). Two days post infection, cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature with formaldehyde directly added to the medium to a final concentration of 5%. Fixed cells were washed extensively with PBS before staining with H2O containing 1% crystal violet and 10% ethanol for 20 min. After rinsing with PBS, the number of plaques was counted and the virus titer was calculated.Cell fractionationNucleocytoplasmic fractionation of A549 cells was performed as previously described80. In short, 106 cells were scraped from 10 cm dish and washed with ice-cold PBS. The cells were resuspended in 0.2 mL of Dautry buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 % NP-40, protease inhibitor cocktail cOmplete, Merck, RNase inhibitor RNasin Plus, Promega) and inclubated 3 min on ice before centrifugation for 5 min, 3.000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was further cleared by centrifugation for 1 min at 15.000 g. Pellet (nuclei) was further washed twice with Dautry buffer and centrifugation for 5 min, 5.000 rpm at 4 °C, and finally lysed in SSB buffer (62.5 mM Tris HCl from 1 M stock solution with pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% Glycerol, 50 mM DTT and 0.01% Bromophenol Blue in distilled water) or Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for protein or RNA quantification, respectively.Transcriptomic analysis of IAV-infected A549 cellsTo evaluate IAV-induced transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes, we performed deep RNA sequencing of A549 cells, infected for 24 h with IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) at MOI 3. The single-end sequencing was performed using Illumina NextSeq 2000 employing Illumina stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. The raw sequencing data was processed with Trimmomatic version 0.3681. Trimmed reads were acquired by removing Illumina TruSeq3 adapters and bases at the start and end of each read, for which the phread score was below 25. Further reads were clipped if the average quality within a sliding window of 10 fell below a phread score of 25. Conclusively reads smaller than 50 bases were removed.For mapping, the human gene annotation release 29 and the corresponding genome (GRCh38.p12) were derived from the GENCODE homepage (https://www.gencodegenes.org/). The virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, H1N1) segment annotation and reference genome were derived from the following NCBI reference sequences: NC_002016.1, NC_002017.1, NC_002018.1, NC_002019.1, NC_002020.1, NC_002021.1, NC_002022.1, and NC_2023.1. A custom genome was generated to include human as well as virus sequences and genes/segments. STAR version 2.6.1c82 was used to map the trimmed sequencing data to the combined reference genome. STAR parameters were adapted from protocol recommendations for STAR83 and STAR-Fusion84. For each alignment, the number of accepted multimappings was set to 10 and the number of accepted mismatches to 3. The maximum intron size and gap size between two read mates was set to 500000. For chimeric segments the following parameters were applied: a minimum length of 10, minimum total score of 1, maximum gap of 3 between segments, a maximum difference of scores equal to 30 and a minimum score difference of 1 between the best score and the next one. Chimeric junctions’ parameters were adjusted to only accept a minimum overhang of 10 and the penalty for non-GT/AG junctions was set to 0. Further the maximum number of stitching of splice junctions was adjusted to −1 for GT/AG and CT/AC motifs and 5 for non-canonical and all other motifs. After mapping, one uninfected control sample showed a high amount of reads mapping to viral segments. This virus contaminated sample was removed in all subsequent analysis.Analysis of alternative polyadenylationReads mapped to the genome were converted from bam to bedgraph format using bedtools version 2.26.0 using default parameters. APAtrap version 1.047 was then used to identify events of alternative polyadenylation. The identification of distal 3’UTR regions (identifyDistal3UTR) and detection of genes with differential APA site usage between untreated and virus infected samples (predictAPA) was performed with default parameters. The following cut-offs were used to determine significance: FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05 and PD > 0.2 and abs(r) >0.1. PD: percentage difference of APA site usage. r: Pearson product moment correlation coefficient, positive values indicate elongation and negative values shortening of mRNA relative to control conditionAnalysis of differential expressionDESeq2 version 1.36.085 was used to determine differentially regulated genes between untreated cells and virus infected cells. Genes were determined to be differentially expressed, if the absolute log2 fold change was greater than 2 and the FDR-adjusted p-value was below 0.01.Analysis of alternative isoform usageThe human reference transcriptome (release 29, GRCh38.p12) was derived from GENCODE. Transcript read count quantification was performed using the pseudo alignment software SALMON v0.13.186. The quantification mode was set to U (single-end, unstranded) with additional correction for sequence-specific and GC bias. The Bioconductor package IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR version 1.8.048,49 was used to identify differential isoform usage between untreated and virus infected samples. Transcripts, quantified by SALMON, were imported using IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR. Isoform switch analysis was performed on untreated against virus infected samples with a false discovery rate (FDR) cut-off of 0.05. Additionally, a difference in isoform fraction (dIF) cut-off of 0.3 and a coding potential cut-off of 0.725 were used, as suggested in the IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR vignette for human samples.Visualization of read coverage on distinct host genes was performed using Integrative Genomics Viewer (Broad Institue).Quantitative LC-MS/MS experiments and analysisFor affinity purification (AP-MS), two confluent 15 cm dishes of HEK293T cells per quadruplicate were transfected with 40 μg of expression plasmids (NS1 R/SI/G, SI/G, SI/R, R/FM/G, FM/G and FM/R; controls: two separate sets of transfection reagent only, ThoV M19). The medium exchange was performed 6 h post-transfection and the cells were harvested 2 days later. Cell lysis (with sonication, 15 cycles at high setting, Bioruptor, Diagenode) and affinity purification (HA-beads, Sigma, A2095, without addition of DNases/RNases) was performed as described previously73.For whole-cell proteomics (FP-MS) of IAV or SFV infected cells, A549 or THP-1 cells were grown to 50% confluence in 6-well format and infected with indicated viruses at MOI 3. 24-hours post infection, the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in guanidinium chloride buffer (6 M guanidinium chloride, 10 mM TCEP, 40 mM chloroacetaminde (CAA), 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8), boiled at 95 °C for 8 min and sonicated (10 min, 4 °C, 30 s on, 30 s off, high setting on Bioruptor Plus, Diagenode). Protein concentrations of cleared lysates were normalized to 50 μg.Proteins were denatured, reduced, alkylated and digested by addition of 200 μl digestion buffer (0.6 M guanidinium chloride, 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 4 mM CAA, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.5 μg LysC (WAKO Chemicals) and 0.5 μg trypsin (Promega) at 30 °C overnight. Peptide purification on StageTips with three layers of C18 Empore filter discs (3 M) and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis was performed as described previously73. Raw files were processed with MaxQuant87 version 1.5.6.2 and default parameters, using label-free quantification and match between run enabled and searched against forward and reverse sequences of the human proteome (Ensembl GRCh37-75 or Uniprot reviewed canonical isoforms) supplemented by baits (AP-MS) or viral protein (FP-MS) sequences.The analysis of MS data sets was performed using R version 4.0.2. iBAQ (intensity based absolute quantification intensities, used for analysis of AP-MS experiments and SFV FP-MS experiment) or LFQ (label-free quantification intensities, used for analysis of IAV FP-MS) values were log2-transformed and protein groups only identified by site, reverse matches and potential contaminants excluded from the analysis. Additionally, protein groups quantified by a single peptide or not detected in at least all-but-one replicate of at least one condition were excluded from further analysis. Missing values were replaced by sampling from the normal distribution with the following parameters: 0.3 * standard deviation, mean − 1.8 * standard deviation, where mean and standard deviation relate to the whole AP-MS or FP-MS datasets. For SFV FP-MS data set, statistical comparison was performed using two-sided equal variance t-test. For other data sets, generalized linear modeling (core function glm) was used along general linear hypothesis testing (multcomp 1.4 function glht) to quantify protein abundance changes and obtain associated p-values. For AP-MS, proteins enriched in particular bait over all controls (log2 fold-change > 2 and FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05) were considered bait interactors. CPSF4 was identified as unique protein satisfying the following conditions: significant interactor of R/SI/G, SI/R, R/FM/G, FM/G but not SI/R or FM/R. For IAV FP-MS, proteins with absolute log2 fold-change > 0.75 and FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.01 were considered significantly changing.For visualization of 1-dimensional density values, R package ggplot2 (version 3.3.2) was used. Specifically, function ggplot and geom_density were used, and for scaled densities the y-axis values were scaled by including y = ..scaled.. into the respective aesthetics (aes) part of the ggplot geom_density function call.Quantification of transcript abundance in cell lines by RT-qPCRRNA was isolated using MACHEREY-NAGEL NucleoSpin RNA mini kit according to manufacturer instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using Takara PrimeScript RT reagent kit with gDNA eraser according to manufacturer instructions unless otherwise stated. PowerUp SYBR Green (Thermo Fisher, A25778) was used for RT-qPCR on QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher). Ct values, obtained using QuantStudio Design and Analysis Software v1.4.3, were averaged across technical replicates and −ΔCt values as a measure of gene expression were calculated as Ct(RPLP0) − Ct(GOI). −ΔΔCt values as a measure of change in gene expression between conditions were calculated as −ΔCt(KO) − (−ΔCt(NTC)).PDUI (percentage of distal polyA site usage index, Fig. 1b)88 as a measure of alternative polyadenylation was calculated as follows:$${PDUI}={Ct}\left({pUTR}\right)-{Ct}({dUTR})$$ (1) In this equation, Ct(pUTR) and Ct(dUTR) denote the Ct values of proximal (common) UTR versus distal (elongated) UTR of a particular gene of interest. Note, that higher PDUI values correspond to more polyA site readthrough and thereby on average longer UTRs. To further illustrate this, the equation above can be alternatively expressed as:$${PDUI}={Ct}\left({pUTR}\right)-{Ct}\left({dUTR}\right)+{Ct}\left({housekeeper}\right)-{Ct}\left({housekeeper}\right)$$ (2) $${PDUI}={Ct}\left({housekeeper}\right)-{Ct}\left({dUTR}\right)+{Ct}\left({pUTR}\right)-{Ct}\left({housekeeper}\right)$$ (3) $${PDUI}=\left({Ct}\left({housekeeper}\right)-{Ct}\left({dUTR}\right)\right)-\left({Ct}\left({housekeeper}\right)-{Ct}\left({pUTR}\right)\right)$$ (4) $${PDUI}=-\varDelta {Ct}\left({dUTR}\right)-\left(-\varDelta {Ct}\left({pUTR}\right)\right)$$ (5) Note, since Ct values are inherently measurements operating in log2 space (i.e. a difference in Ct values of 1 indicates a 2-fold change in target abundance), PDUI and ΔPDUI are also measurements operating in log2 space – for this reason, plots that depict these values also have (log2) included in y-axis titles. Naturally, no additional or explicit log2 transformations are required for their calculation, as shown above. PDUI is thereby in principle numerically limited to values below 0, where PDUI = 0 indicates a 100% readthrough of the assayed polyA site, and e.g. PDUI = −2 indicates a 25% readthrough of the assayed polyA site. ΔPDUI is calculated as PDUI(test condition) − PDUI(control condition), and is thereby also a measurement operating in log2 space. ΔPDUI reflects the difference in polyA site readthrough levels between indicated conditions (e.g. ΔPDUI = 1 indicates a 2-fold increase in polyA site readthrough in test condition relative to control condition). The ΔPDUI is positive for 3’UTR elongating events, and negative for 3’UTR shortening events, in respect to control condition.For detection of APA events, RT-qPCR was performed using primers targeting short (-c) or long (-a) human mRNA isoforms: EIF1-c (AAGGGAGCTTTTGGTGGTAGA, TTTGTGGCAAGCCAGATGTC), EIF1-a (GAAATGGGCAGTGGAGGATTC, CAGTTGACCAGAGAGGGACAA), TFAP2A-c (CCACTGTCCTCCCTTAAAAGC, TACCAGGTGGTCCCAAATGT), TFAP2A-a (CATTTGTTCCTGCGCTCTGA, CGCGTTCGTTTGTCGAGATT), LUC7L3-c (CAGGACTGATGTGACCTACCA, ACTGAGCAAGCCACATGTTT), LUC7L3-a (CTCTGAGCCCTCATCCATTCT, CATGAAGTCCCATCCCACAGA), SFPQ-c (TGGTCTGTTTGGGCAGGTAA, GGAAATTCAGTGGCACAAGGT), SFPQ-a (CTTGGGCAAGCCACTAAGTT, TTACGCACTGCAGAAATGCT), CD47-c (AGTGATGGACTCCGATTTGG, GGGTCTCATAGGTGACAACCA), CD47-a (AAGAGAACTCCAGTGTTGCT, ACGGTAACACAGCTGTAAAACA), and mouse mRNA isoforms: Sfpq-c (TGGCCTGTTTGGGCAGGTAA, GGAAATTCGGTGGCACAAGGT), Sfpq-a (CTGGAGGGGAAATGGGAAAA, AGCATCCTTTCACCACTCTTCA), Eif1-c (TGTTGCGACATGAAGGGTGA, GCACTGGCTCGTACTGAGTT), Eif1-a (CTGTGGCTGTTGGGCTATCT, GGCCACCTTTTAGAGCCAGT), Tfap2a-c (GAGCAATTGCCAAGGGAGAG, TCAGTGGCTGTCTTTACCCA), Tfap2a-a (TGCTACGACGATGTGTGCAT, CGCAACGCAGCAATTGTTTT), Kpnb1-c (GGTACCGCCTCACTCACACA, CCACCTTCACTGTACCGTTG), Kpnb1-a (TTCCACACTACCAGGAAGCA, GGGAACAAGGCACCCTGA).For transcript quantification, RT-qPCR was performed using the following primers: Cpsf4 (TCATGCACCCTCGATTTGAAC, ACGACCTTTGTAATGGCGGA), Ifit3 (TGGTCATGTGCCGTTACAGG, GCTGCGAGGTCTTCAGACTT), NS1 (TGACCATGGCCTCTGTACCT, GCATGGACCAGTCCCTTGAC), NS1-RBD (TCTTTGGCATGTCCGCAAAC, GTGCTGCCCCTTCCTCTTAG), CPSF4 (CGTGTAAATTCATGCACCCTCG, ACGACCTTTGTAATGGCGGA), mIL-6 (TAGTCCTTCCTACCCCAATTTCC, TTGGTCCTTAGCCACTCCTTC), M (AGATGAGYCTTCTAACCGA, GCAAAGACATCTTCAAGTYTC), ThoVM (ACCAGTGAGGTCTTTCAGCG, TGTAGGTCCCGGTGGATCTT), RPLP0 (GGATCTGCTGCATCTGCTTG, GCGACCTGGAAGTCCAACTA), U6 (CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACATATAC, GGAACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGTG).Protein abundance quantification by Western blottingAt the time of sample harvest, the cells were washed with PBS, lysed in SSB buffer (62.5 mM Tris HCl from 1 M stock solution with pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% Glycerol, 50 mM DTT and 0.01% Bromophenol Blue in distilled water) and protein concentrations measured using Pierce 660-nm Protein Assay with an addition of Ionic detergent compatibility kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions. Protein concentrations were equalized and up to 10 micrograms of proteins were loaded in NuPAGE Bis-Tris, 1 mm, 4–12% gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein separation was performed according to gel manufacturer instructions and proteins transferred to 0.22 μm nitrocellulose membrane (1 h at 100 V in 25 mM Trizma base, 0.192 M Glycine, pH 8.3). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% skim milk or 4% BSA in TBS-T buffer (0.25% Tween-20 in phosphate buffered saline solution) with gentle agitation. For detection of protein abundance by western blotting, the following antibodies were used: GFP (Invitrogen, A6455, 1:1000), HA (Cell Signaling, 2367, 1:1000), HIST3H3 (Abcam, ab1791-100, 1:10,000), CPSF4 (Abcam, ab131218, 1:1000), CPSF3 (Abcam, ab72295, 1:1000), ACTB-HRP (Santa Cruz, sc-47778, 1:5000), TUBB (Santa Cruz, sc-9104, 1:1000), NCL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 39-6400, 1:1000), msHRP (Cell Signaling, 7076, 1:10,000) and rbHRP (Cell Signaling, 7074, 1:10,000). The antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk or 4% BSA (TBS-T); the membranes were washed 5× for 5 min with TBS-T between and after incubations with primary and secondary antibodies. Western Lightning ECL Pro (PerkinElmer) was used for band detection according to manufacturer instructions. Normalization of band signals was performed using Image Lab Software (Bio-Rad, version 6.0.1 build 34).Quantification of secreted cytokinesFor detection of human and mouse IL-6, commercially available ELISA kits were used (mIL-6, BD, 555240 and hIL-6, BD, 555220) according to manufacturer instructions. Fur multiplexed quantification of cytokines from mouse BALF, Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine 23-plex Assay (Bio-Rad, M60009RDPD) was used according to manufacturer instructions. Statistics were calculated using Student’s t test.In vivo experimentsIn order to adhere to the 3R principles and since the CPSF complex is conserved between females and males and there were no indications so far that APA is affected by gender, we opted to only focus on female mice in the herein presented in vivo experiments. 8 weeks-old female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Janvier Labs and housed under normal conditions (relative humidity 45–65%, temperature 20–24 °C, 12 h light-dark cycle). Mice were anesthetized with 90 mg/kg Ketamine (WDT) and 9 mg/kg Xylazine (Serumwerk Bernburg AG). Mice were inoculated intranasally with 105 pfu of R/SI/G or R/SI/R viruses (8 mice/condition) or mock (4 mice/condition). 3 days post infection, BALF, lung homogenate supernatants and FFPE lungs (5 mice/condition) were harvested for cytokine measurements, virus titrations and histopathology, respectively.All experiments with mice were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Federation for Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) and the national animal welfare body. Experiments were in compliance with the German animal protection law and were approved by the animal welfare committee of the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg (permits X-18/01 K and G-15/125).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Rohde, PhD, MS, SM (ASCP) CM, SVCM, MBCM, FACSc: Discuss this specific study of the effect of electronic nudges and how this was analyzed. I’m really interested in this because I’ve done some work in nudging influenza vaccination rates in older adults with cardiovascular disease.Chad Worz, PharmD, BCGP, FASCP: This refers to what they call a NUDGE-FLU trial [NCT05542004]. It was a Danish study. It involved just short of a million people, 27.5% of those people had cardiovascular disease and the effort was to get more flu shots into people and reduce some of that hesitancy. Now, to be fair, the Dutch are pretty good at this. About 78%, 79% of their population is vaccinated. So they were analyzing how we get that next incremental bump. They were targeting with different electronic means. In fact, 9 different messages that they sent out to try to get that nudge, to get that vaccine. And 2 of the particular electronic messages worked well, 1 was a repeating message. “You need to get your flu shot. Here are the risks associated with your cardiovascular disease.” And this hearkens back to some data we haven’t really talked about, which is the fact that the flu vaccine seems to have some protective effects with cardiovascular disease, whether that’s due to the inflammation, or again having the influenza virus prey on somebody that’s got compromised comorbidities, but they were able to repeat the message, and that messaging works. So sending out a message saying it’s time for your flu shot, 2 weeks later sending it again time for your flu shot, seemed to give them a bump in getting those hesitant individuals vaccinated. The other letter that worked was the one that was very specific toward cardiovascular disease, and it said, “You have this risk factor, and therefore you’re at a higher risk of complications and problems.” That letter also seemed to work. Now I’ve tied it all back to AI [artificial intelligence] and the world that we live in, and I come back to that individual that’s sitting in front of you or the individual in your practice, how do they like to be communicated with? Can I text them or email them? Are there algorithms that I’m running in the background of my pharmacy systems that tell me I’ve got to have an extra special emphasis on these individuals? I think employing all of those things; this trial ratifies that, that works. And finding ways to best communicate works and including maybe some of those things that we're afraid of like AI and text messaging, and things like that.Rodney E. Rohde, PhD, MS, SM (ASCP) CM, SVCM, MBCM, FACSc: I actually looked up the study when I saw this was coming our way and it is a fascinating study and just one quick point that you stated I think, and again, this is something I think the public needs to understand is that when you’re looking at studies, when you cite studies—and we like to cite our studies—the public doesn’t always understand the context. The thing you just mentioned is so critical, the Danish already have a high vaccine acceptance, but because of that [messaging], they got a bump of 4% to 5%. When you explain that to the public, that can mean 100s of 1000s of people are now vaccinated. It’s a big thing. A 4% bump is a huge thing when you’re looking at a general population. So having someone to talk about that, I really appreciate it. Do you guys have any thoughts on nudging, clinical nudging, have you all been involved with anything like that?Randy McDonough, PharmD, MS, BCGP, BCPS, FAPhA: In the community and our community pharmacy, we are trying to do that more. We do have the patient cell phone number, and we try to do texts, but I want to be careful with it too with the right amount because you don’t want them to get used to seeing texts and then fatigue so it’s not doing anything. But we have an online presence, and people will check in online, then we can actually send them information, especially if we’re looking at a flu vaccine or something like that and they decide not to actually set up an appointment, we can send them a message and say, “You looked at this, are you interested in doing that?” So I do think there are a lot of different avenues for pharmacists to nudge their patients to get the vaccination. We have so many tools out there, in technology, but how do we use the technology effectively?Rodney E. Rohde, PhD, MS, SM (ASCP) CM, SVCM, MBCM, FACSc: I think it shows that those studies are so important because we may not need 9 messages, we might need 3, and we might need a text message, a phone call to my parents who don’t want to text or look at a computer. I mean, my parents are 80 years old. They don’t even want to think about an iPhone. They want a phone call from a human being. I deal with this all the time, like, “Dad, just listen you’re going to have to screen,” and he’s like, “I just want to talk to my doctor. I want to talk to my pharmacist.” So it’s really critical when you think of the 65 and older population.Chad Worz, PharmD, BCGP, FASCP: Again, it goes back to the diversity of our population. There’s going to be a time when text messaging is the only way to communicate with somebody. I look at my 15-year-old son…Rodney E. Rohde, PhD, MS, SM (ASCP) CM, SVCM, MBCM, FACSc: We’re not there yet.Chad Worz, PharmD BCGP, FASCP: … when he’s 25 and it’s time for his flu vaccine, a text message is probably the best way to get his attention.Rodney E. Rohde, PhD, MS, SM (ASCP) CM, SVCM, MBCM, FACSc: Or a short social media video.Randy McDonough, PharmD, MS, BCGP, BCPS, FAPhA:I was going to say, we’ve actually gotten into that where we’re doing regular Facebook reels and it’s just amazing. When an influencer has thousands and thousands of followers, their message has an impact.Rodney E. Rohde, PhD, MS, SM (ASCP) CM, SVCM, MBCM, FACSc: Yes, it does.Transcript edited for clarity.

None of them were nearly as severe.Updated - August 22, 2023 09:37 pm IST Arun Panchapakesan Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT A nurse wearing a cloth mask attends to a flu patient at the Walter Reed Hospital, Washington, D.C., during the 1918 influenza pandemic. | Photo Credit: Public domain This is part II of a two-part story on the virus that caused the Great Influenza epidemic. Read part I here.The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the apex organisation in the U.S. on matters of public health and safety. Research on any new infectious agent must be first approved by the CDC. But in 2005, the CDC received an application for study on a very old infectious agent.The researchers in question wanted the body’s approval to recreate a deadly pathogen – one that had not infected anyone since 1920. Despite the serious risk to the public, the CDC scientists carefully reviewed the application and granted permission to perform the requisite experiments necessary, because they deemed the experiments the researchers had proposed to be sufficiently important. Aspirin misuse may have made 1918 flu pandemic worseThe applicants wanted to recreate the H1N1 influenza virus – which had killed around 50 million people in an outbreak in 1918 – from its genetic material.Terrence TumpeyInfluenza viruses are almost always circulating among humans. The nature of the virus means that every year, the virus’s genetic material undergoes some minor changes, rendering it a little different from the virus of the previous year. So scientists have to guess which changes are likely to survive the next year, and design or update their vaccines accordingly.An influenza virus can also infect birds, pigs, horses, and other domestic animals. It can assort the types of the two genes it contains – haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) – in these animals to generate a new virus altogether, some of which may infect humans. All these complications ensure that designing an effective vaccine for influenza remains challenging.When the CDC received the application for the 1918 H1N1 virus revival, vaccine efficacy was a meagre 10%.The CDC, realising the value of the proposal, installed special security measures. Only one man, Terrence Tumpey, was authorised to work on the project, and that too in complete isolation. He was allowed to work only after all his colleagues had left for the day, and his laboratory and freezers were fit with biometric access restrictions.Tumpey was to wear a specialised respirator mask that allowed him to breathe only filtered air. He was required to wear two pairs of gloves, shoe covers, and a full-body surgical gown, and he would have to take a shower every time he left the laboratory. He also had to constantly take antiviral medication, and he was informed that should he contract the virus, he would be isolated and would not be able to contact anyone in the outside world, including his family.Lung damageWorking this way, Tumpey first generated ‘recombinant’ viruses. These are artificial viruses generated in the laboratory such that they contained just the H1 and N1 gene segments from the 1918 strain, while the remaining pieces of the genetic material came from a regular laboratory strain that did not cause severe disease (in mice). The objective of his experiment was to identify which of the eight gene segments of the 1918 virus was responsible for its unprecedented power. Doctors urge people to stay vigilant against COVID-19 variant EG.5.1 Tumpey thought that, when complemented with the genes from the 1918 strain, the laboratory strain might be able to cause slightly more severe disease in mice. He was wrong: the H1 and N1 genes of the 1918 virus made the laboratory strain so virulent that within five days, all the infected mice had died.An autopsy of the deceased rodents revealed that while there was extensive lung damage, the virus was not found in the other major organs of their bodies – brain, liver, spleen, etc. The virus mainly infected the lungs, and laid waste to them.Tumpey continued his experiments with the recombinant viruses. He found that while all eight pieces of the virus’s genetic material caused severe disease, two in particular stood out: the haemagglutinin and the RNA polymerase genes.Suggestive, not conclusiveHaemagglutinin is the protein on the outer surface of the virus that docks with proteins on the cells of another organism. This way, the virus has a portal through to begin its invasion. The haemagglutinin segment of the 1918 strain contained modifications such that the virus could easily gain access to cells.The viral RNA polymerase, on the other hand, makes copies of the viral genetic material. In the H1N1 strain, the polymerase was extremely efficient at this process, allowing the virus to make numerous copies of itself in a very short span of time. This then took a heavy toll on the infected cell, since the virus hijacked the cellular machinery to replicate itself.All the experiments that Tumpey had conducted until then were suggestive, not conclusive. He had inserted pieces of the 1918 H1N1 virus inside a regular laboratory strain and found that doing so increased the virulence of the laboratory strain. Results obtained with such an experimental system would always leave room for doubt as to whether the real, complete virus would have behaved similarly. But there could be no room for doubt in this endeavour.As a result, Tumpey had to recreate the full 1918 H1N1 influenza virus to solve this conundrum. He mixed the genetic material of all the eight individual pieces of the virus and put them in the same cell. In a few weeks, the world’s deadliest virus appeared in his cell-culture plates, back from extinction after nearly a century. The interpreter of loneliness: D.H. LawrenceUnrivalledThe full virus demonstrated a pathogenicity unrivalled by any other influenza virus scientists have ever studied – recombinant or natural. It was highly virulent: there were 39,000-times more virions (virus particles) in the lungs of the mice infected with the 1918 virus than those infected by the more benign laboratory strain. The former lungs were filled with fluid within days, causing extensive lung damage and resulting in death.Tumpey also found that while the haemagglutinin and the RNA polymerase genes were important reasons for the extreme nature of the 1918 virus, by themselves they did not wreak just as much havoc as when they did in combination with the other gene segments.This is because individual genes of a virus seldom undergo changes in isolation. Every change will, likelier than not, influence other genes of the virus – especially changes that produce effects as large as those of the haemagglutinin and the polymerase genes of the 1918 virus.All viruses have to ensure they will be transmitted to more hosts. A virus that kills its host too soon will fail at this objective because a virus is only alive as long as it is inside a host. So a change in a virus that makes it more pathogenic will either kill the host faster or it will become an easier target for the host’s immune system. Both outcomes are detrimental to the virus’s long-term survival.So such genetic changes must be associated with alterations elsewhere in the genome that mitigate those effects on the creature’s long-term survival prospects. It could be a mutation that enhances its transmission rate, one that slows the viral life cycle, or something else that allows the virus to escape the immune system long enough for it to be transmitted.The 1918 virus had an enhanced transmission rate due to its unique haemagglutinin, a highly active polymerase to speed up the viral replication, and (as a result) disease progression, plus a few smaller changes that allowed it to better escape the immune system. Taken together, it had the perfect tools in its arsenal to make it the ultimate killing machine. How pandemics begin A new benchmarkThe work of Jeffery Taubenberger, Ann Reid, Johan Hultin (described in the previous article), Terrence Tumpey, and other scientists who were involved in the effort collectively showed to the world how the 1918 influenza virus originated, and why it was so deadly. Taubenberger and Reid’s determination of the genetic sequence also laid the foundation for future scientists to better understand how the influenza virus causes disease.More importantly, their work created a benchmark. The 1918 H1N1 strain was the deadliest influenza virus to ever strike humans. By thoroughly characterising its genetic features, the researchers set the stage for others to discern similar features in the various influenza variants circulating today, which in turn eased the way to better vaccine designs, with higher efficacy, as well as to other therapeutics to prevent the disease from emerging as a global health concern once more.Since 1918, there have been three major influenza pandemics: in 1957, 1968, and 2009. None of them were as severe as the one in 1918. The death tolls in 1957 and 1968 were estimated at 1 million; that in 2009 was lower, around 0.3 million.But the 1918 influenza pandemic is a reminder to us all, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, that ever so rarely, nature will arrive at that perfect, deadly combination after mixing thousands of genes and end up creating something as destructive as the 1918 H1N1 influenza virus. Ironically, nature’s ability to do so is at the very heart of evolution, and of all life on earth. Influenza viruses are almost always circulating among humans. The nature of the virus means that every year, the virus’s genetic material undergoes some minor changes, rendering it a little different from the virus of the previous year. So scientists have to guess which changes are likely to survive the next year, and design or update their vaccines accordingly. Terrence Tumpey first generated ‘recombinant’ viruses. These are artificial viruses generated in the laboratory such that they contained just the H1 and N1 gene segments from the 1918 strain, while the remaining pieces of the genetic material came from a regular laboratory strain that did not cause severe disease (in mice).

He had inserted pieces of the 1918 H1N1 virus inside a regular laboratory strain and found that doing so increased the virulence of the laboratory strain.

BySusan Thixton Published August 18, 2023 The PetFoodIndustry.com website reports that cats in numerous countries have died due to contracting an avian influenza from their pet food – the strain H5N1 was found. Three cats in South Korean shelters have died, several more have been have been sickened. In Poland, twenty-five cats tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza, fourteen cats were euthanized, eleven more have died. About Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza: “a subtype of the virus. It can cause severe illness and high mortality rates in domestic poultry and wild birds. The viruses can devastate poultry industries and have economic repercussions due to trade restrictions. Some varieties, including H5N1, can cross species barriers and may cause severe illnesses in mammals.” These cat illnesses and deaths mean that pet food manufacturers in numerous countries were including/are including poultry infected with the “highly pathogenic avian influenza” as ingredients. How could this happen? Feed grade ingredients. Could this happen in the US? Yes. U.S. federal law (the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act) declares that any food (human or animal) that contains any part of a diseased animal or animal that died other than by slaughter is adulterated – illegal. Federal laws prohibit non-USDA inspected and passed animals from being utilized as food/food ingredients in order to prevent avian influenza and other diseases being spread through food (human and animal food). However, the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) directly ignores this federal law with pet food/animal food. The FDA CVM’s current position: “We do not believe that the use of diseased animals or animals that died otherwise than by slaughter to make animal food poses a safety concern and we intend to continue to exercise enforcement discretion.” When asked to provide scientific evidence to validate FDA CVM’s ‘belief that the use of diseased animals or animals that died otherwise than by slaughter’ poses no safety concern in pet food, the Agency failed to provide any science. While FDA is the governing agency over pet food, the USDA is the governing agency over US poultry farms that supply pet food poultry ingredients. The USDA has multiple webpages and documents providing poultry farmers with assistance on what to do if their farm is infected. “If your flock is infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will provide indemnity and compensation for some of your losses and costs.” Of concern to U.S. pet owners, the USDA states: “Disposal methods include composting, onsite burial, incineration, rendering and landfilling.” Yes…the USDA allows culled flocks of highly pathogenic avian influenza contaminated birds to be rendered, and the FDA allows the diseased animals to be included in pet food/animal feed – with no warning or disclosure to pet food consumers. Just like in the US, pet food is frequently used to dispose of sick, non-slaughtered animals in countries all over the world (feed grade ingredients). Though we cannot positively confirm, we suspect (highly suspect) the pet foods in South Korea and Poland (countries reporting sick/dying cats linked to contaminated pet food) were using feed grade ingredients (were not using inspected and passed poultry) which in turn infected the cats consuming the foods. The Centers for Disease Control has maintained a database of highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in the US. Since January 2022, 58,791,621 birds have been affected in the US. Forty-seven states have documented outbreaks. Pet owners can safely assume some of these 58 million sick birds were rendered and ended up in pet food. Which pet foods? We don’t know. The FDA refuses to require pet food manufacturers to disclose this information to pet food consumers. Rendering should kill the avian influenza pathogen, however just like with other pathogens (such as Salmonella) rendering or cooking of the pet food is not a certain guarantee of safety. Kibble pet foods that include rendered ingredients remain the most commonly recalled style of pet food due to pathogenic bacteria that survived the pet food manufacturing process. Symptoms of infected cats (it is unknown if dog symptoms would be similar) were labored breathing, bloody diarrhea and neurological signs. Personal opinion: It is beyond my understanding to how the FDA can be so acutely cautious about pet foods contaminated with Salmonella while at the same time the Agency blatantly ignores the many risks (including highly pathogenic avian influenza) of allowing diseased animals and animals that have died other than by slaughter in pet food. I personally put the FDA CVM in contact with two pet food manufacturing employees diagnosed with tularemia that the Centers for Disease Control confirmed were exposed to this serious bacteria from rendered pet food ingredients. The FDA CVM blatantly ignored that too. Are pets and pet food manufacturing employees considered ‘disposable’ by FDA? The old saying ‘If you play with fire, you’ll get burned’ certainly applies here. For the FDA and government agencies all over the world to continue to allow diseased and non-slaughtered animals to be disposed of into pet food is playing with fire. Unfortunately, the ones who get burned are the pets and the manufacturing employees. Those that allow the fire – walk away unscathed.

In this article:avian influenza infected pet food 17 Comments 17 Comments Sally August 18, 2023 at 1:39 pm Well, this is disturbing because canned foods seem so processed, how could any pathogens survive? However, after reading up on the rendering process, which can be done with high or low temperatures, Wikipedia quotes from the Dept. of Agriculture (“FAQ on BSE”. United States Department of Agriculture. Retrieved 2017-01-28.), “Meat and bone meal in animal feed was one route for the late-20th century spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad-cow disease, BSE), which is also fatal to humans. Early in the 21st century, most countries tightened regulations to prevent this.” Did the U.S. change their regulations over BSE? If so, why not avian flu? Reply T Allen August 18, 2023 at 3:58 pm BSE is not killed by heat. USDA/FSIS has specific guidelines in the slaughter/processing of mature beef animals (30 mths or older, younger animals can’t spread the disease) for human consumption. Since most beef animals are butchered before 30mths of age the risk to us is low. There are tests that can be done on dead animals to see if they are infected as well. That said, there is no restriction on the use of infected animals for pet food through rendering as far as I know. https://www.usda.govopics/animals/bse-surveillance-information-center/bse-frequently-asked-questions. Reply aimee August 18, 2023 at 6:46 pm My understanding is that this virus would be inactivated (killed) by temperatures used in canning, rendering or kibble production. I’d suspect then, that even if materials from infected flocks were to get into commercial canned or kibbled pet food, those foods would not be a source of infection. Apparently, according to the article, in Poland the source(s) of the infections have not yet been determined, whereas in South Korea, they were traced back to pet food from a company called Nature’s Raw. This leads me to believe, though the article does not specify this, that these infections were from an uncooked food. I believe the virus will transmit if an infected carcass is fed raw. The article did say the food was not sterilized because the equipment to do so was not functional. Reply Barbara Fellnermayr August 18, 2023 at 9:34 pm Can someone post a link to the article?

How would a pet food company be allowed to buy contaminated birds? Don’t they have to be destroyed? Again, it gets back to corporate profits. They must have bought these birds at such a low price that they would risk using them to feather their pockets. WHY is it only cats getting sick? No reports of dogs getting sick?

Photo: CanvaThe Finnish Food Authority has declared that all minks be euthanised at fur farms where avian influenza has been detected.According to the Finnish Food Authority, this decision has been made because the upper respiratory tract of a mink contains receptors that can bind to both avian and human influenza viruses. This, says the Finnish Food Authority, makes minks sensitive to infections caused by both types of influenza, and this species can, therefore, be more effective than other mammals as an intermediate host for avian influenza, enabling the virus to mutate more effectively into a form that will infect humans.Based on genetic investigations, the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare noted that some of the viruses found in fur animals had mutations indicating that the virus has adapted due to mammalian infections. Viruses bearing mutations that enhance the replication of the virus in mammalian cells were found on 2 farms.Reuters reports that the number of farmed mink and foxes to be culled at 3 fur farms stands at 50,000.For the latest news and information on the global avian influenza situation, click here.“To prevent such variants of the virus, it is important to put down all minks at infected fur farms, says the Authority. It added that decisions on putting down foxes and raccoon dogs are made on a case-by-case basis, “impacted by the extent and intensity of the symptoms of avian influenza at the farm”.So far, the Finnish Food Authority has issued euthanasia orders for the animals of 3 fur farms while preparations for new euthanasia orders continue. According to current data, avian influenza has spread to 21 fur farms in Finland. The first results from whole-genome sequencing indicate wild birds, particularly the black-headed gull, to be the source of infection.Join 31,000+ subscribers Subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated about all the need-to-know content in the poultry sector, three times a week.

View: Text | PDF Research Article Pulmonology Rescue of alveolar wall liquid secretion blocks fatal lung injury due to influenza-staphylococcal coinfection Text PDF Abstract Secondary lung infection by inhaled Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a common and lethal event for individuals infected with influenza A virus (IAV). How IAV disrupts host defense to promote SA infection in lung alveoli, where fatal lung injury occurs, is not known. We addressed this issue using real-time determinations of alveolar responses to IAV in live, intact, perfused lungs. Our findings show that IAV infection blocked defensive alveolar wall liquid (AWL) secretion and induced airspace liquid absorption, thereby reversing normal alveolar liquid dynamics and inhibiting alveolar clearance of inhaled SA. Loss of AWL secretion resulted from inhibition of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel in the alveolar epithelium, and airspace liquid absorption was caused by stimulation of the alveolar epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Loss of AWL secretion promoted alveolar stabilization of inhaled SA, but rescue of AWL secretion protected against alveolar SA stabilization and fatal SA-induced lung injury in IAV-infected mice. These findings reveal a central role for AWL secretion in alveolar defense against inhaled SA and identify AWL inhibition as a critical mechanism of IAV lung pathogenesis. AWL rescue may represent a new therapeutic approach for IAV-SA coinfection. Authors Stephanie Tang, Ana Cassandra De Jesus, Deebly Chavez, Sayahi Suthakaran, Sarah K.L.

We aimed to evaluate potential adverse events (AEs) following influenza vaccination in elderly cancer patients using the self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistic method. From a large linked database of Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency vaccination data and the National Health Insurance Service claims data, we identified cancer patients aged over 65 who received flu vaccines during the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 seasons. We included all the outcomes occurring on 1–84 days post-vaccination and evaluated all temporal risk windows, which started 1–28 days and ended 2–42 days. Patients who were diagnosed with the same disease during a year prior to vaccination were excluded. We used the hierarchy of ICD-10 to identify statistically significant clustering. This study included 431,276 doses of flu vaccine. We detected signals for 1 set: other dorsopathies on 1–15 days (attributable risk 16.5 per 100,000, P = 0.017). Dorsopathy is a known AE of influenza vaccine. No statistically significant clusters were found when analyzed by flu season. Therefore, influenza vaccination is more recommended for elderly patients with cancer and weakened immune systems.

The estimated overall rate of influenza-associated respiratory deaths each year is 4.0–8.8 per 100,000 individuals for all ages and 51.3–99.4 among individuals aged over 75 years1. Among them, immunocompromised patients, such as cancer patients, have a higher risk of death. They are more vulnerable to complications from influenza because factors related to immunosuppression affect the reaction to viral infection2. Previous studies showed that hospitalization for influenza was 5–10 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population, with a mortality rate of 9%3. To prevent influenza, influenza vaccination is widely recommended in the general population, especially for immunocompromised people, including cancer patients. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends influenza vaccination for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment4. Similarly, publications released by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) stipulate that cancer patients and immunocompromised patients are included in the priority targets for flu vaccination5.Among cancer patients, the elderly have a particularly higher risk of influenza than other populations due to immunosenescence; thus, influenza vaccination for elderly cancer patients is strongly recommended. In Korea, KDCA has provided inactivated influenza vaccines free of charge every year to the elderly (aged 65 and over), children (aged 6 months through 12 years old), and pregnant women as part of the national immunization program (NIP)6, which shot up the influenza vaccination rate among the elderly to 86% as of 20197. Considering the results of previous studies showing that the influenza vaccination rates of cancer patients and non-cancer elderly populations were similar8, the coverage of elderly cancer patients is expected to be very high. However, there have been few safety studies on influenza vaccination in elderly cancer patients in real-world settings. Most previous studies have demonstrated serological efficacy in patients treated with chemotherapy9,10,11, but the evidence for safety was relatively small. Although most studies related to the safety showed no significant difference in safety results in cancer patients vaccinated with influenza compared to the control group10,12, some patients with severe immune-related AEs such as encephalitis and pneumonia were observed11.Since little is known about the safety of influenza vaccines in cancer patients from clinical trials or observational studies, it is important to identify potential adverse events (AEs) through post-marketing studies. Among the data mining methods for vaccine and drug safety surveillance, tree-based scan statistics has been recently introduced and used to detect safety signals without pre-specifying outcomes of concern13,14. In particular, tree-temporal scan statistics is a method evaluating whether any of a wide variety of health outcomes is temporally associated with the receipt of a specific drug15. Using this, it is possible to identify potential adverse events without pre-specifying the specific events or risk intervals of concern. Previous studies have demonstrated that the self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistic method is applicable to simultaneously evaluate a wide range of vaccine-adverse reactions16,17,18,19. Although rigorous epidemiological studies might be required to confirm the signals detected by this method, it helps identify previously unknown and unexpected safety issues.Thus, the aim of the present study was to identify potential adverse events following influenza vaccination in elderly cancer patients by applying the self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistic method and to find unexpected and unknown adverse events.Material and methodsData sourcesThe study was performed based on the vaccination registration database from the KDCA and the health insurance claims database from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). In Korea, since vaccines are one of the non-covered medications under national health insurance, vaccination records for NIP vaccines can be identified through the computerized registration database of National Immunization Registry Integration System20. Vaccination by NIP for the entire population should be recorded electronically to reimburse the cost of vaccines20. The vaccination registration database includes information such as vaccination date, injection site, vaccination clinic, and type of vaccine. To identify the medical utilization information, we used the health insurance claims data generated in the process of managing the national healthcare insurance program in Korea. Since the National Health Insurance Act was enacted in 1999, the Health Insurance and Review Assessment (HIRA) has reviewed medical fees for reimbursement decisions and the NHIS reimburses healthcare services based on the assessment results from HIRA21,22. From the reimbursement process, the NHIS constructed a health insurance claims database that covered the entire population of 50 million and provided the data to researchers for study. The NHIS database comprises information on sociodemographic characteristics, diagnostic information, drug prescription information, and procedure information.We used the linked databases of the national immunization registry data and the national health insurance claims data between 2015 and 2018. To link vaccination registration data and NHIS claims data, we requested that the KDCA deliver vaccination registration data to the NHIS. The NHIS linked two databases using resident registration numbers and provided us with anonymized data.Study population and exposureCancer patients who received influenza vaccines during the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 seasons and who were aged 65 years or older on the date of influenza vaccination were included in the eligible study population. We excluded patients who were less than 65 years old because they were not covered under NIP for influenza vaccination. Cancer patients were identified as those diagnosed with cancer from at least one inpatient setting or from at least three outpatient settings for a year prior to vaccination. We used the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code (C00-C97: Malignant neoplasms) and rare and intractable disease registration program code for cancer (V027, V193, V194: cancer-related codes for exempted calculation of health insurance) simultaneously to minimize misclassification of diagnosis. Since only the year of birth could be identified in the database, the age of the subjects was calculated by assuming the date of birth as January 1.The two flu seasons used in this study were defined as follows: the 2016/2017 season, corresponding to the period from September 1, 2016, to April 30, 2017, and the 2017/2018 season, corresponding to the period from September 1, 2017, to April 30, 2018, by referring to previous studies23,24. For those who received more than one dose per season, only the first dose per season was included in the analysis because the risk and control intervals for each dose could overlap. If an individual was vaccinated during two flu seasons, each vaccination was considered independent.Hierarchical diagnosis treeTree‐temporal scan data mining method is conducted based on a predefined tree structure. We used a hierarchical tree structure defined by ICD-10 code to identify outcomes. ICD-10 codes have a hierarchical structure with five levels, from the broadest at the top to the most specific diagnosis code at the bottom (Supplement Fig. 1). The first and broadest level contains 21 sections classified by functional apparatus25.Some diagnosis codes indicating the following conditions were excluded from the tree (Supplement Table 1): diagnosis used in the definition of the study subject such as neoplasms, outcomes in the periods of pregnancy, perinatal, childbirth, infantile, or juvenile; congenital or hereditary conditions; diagnosis codes related to external causes of morbidity and mortality; and diagnosis codes related to factors influencing health status and contact with health services. Finally, the resulting pruned tree contained 5,866 ICD-10 codes containing 14 first levels.Incident outcomesThe outcomes of interest were focused on ‘incident’ diagnoses in the outpatient, inpatient, or emergency department setting during the follow-up period. To examine only incident diagnoses after vaccination, the diagnoses observed with the same first 3 letters of ICD-10 code during a year prior to vaccination were excluded. This was to avoid overestimating the occurrence or redundant counting of similar diseases. We did not look for clustering in the first (broadest) and second levels of the tree. Each patient was allowed to contribute to multiple outcomes during the follow-up period unless their diagnoses belonged to the same three levels of the tree.Risk and control windowsWe included all the health outcomes occurring on 1–84 days (12 weeks) following the first influenza vaccination per flu season in the analysis. The follow-up period was selected to include potential adverse events, taking into account the time from occurrence to diagnosis and coding. The day of vaccination was not included in the follow-up period on account of the possibility of a preventive-care visit or a health-care visit due to other health concerns. The length of temporal risk windows was between 2 and 42 days, which starts between 1 and 28 days after vaccination and ends between 2 and 42 days after vaccination (Fig. 1). The control window was defined as the remaining days within the follow‐up period but outside the risk window. To avoid lowering power due to analysis of implausible risk intervals (e.g. short risk windows after a long time following vaccination), the length of the minimum temporal risk window was limited to be atleast 20% of the distance between the time zero and the end of the risk window.Figure 1Illustration of risk and control windows for self-controlled tree-temporal tree-based scan statistic analysis. Examples of potential risk windows evaluated with their control period(s), assuming that 84 days of complete follow-up exists for the patient. The individuals participating in the study have at least one risk window and one control window, respectively. (a) A potential risk window that starts on day 1 following influenza vaccination. The corresponding control period begins the day after the end of the potential risk window and extends to day 84. (b) A potential risk window located somewhere in the middle of the follow-up period. The corresponding control period consists of the sections of the follow-up period that are not in the potential risk window.Full size imageTree‑temporal scan statistic (statistical analysis)Tree-temporal scan statistic is a method used to evaluate a broad range of diagnosis codes for various clinical outcomes and groups of related outcomes. It also considers multiple potential risk windows simultaneously. While adjusting for multiple tests, the number of cases within the risk window is compared with the number of cases within the control window that would be expected by chance. This comparison assumes that the incidences of the cases were randomly and uniformly distributed over time. All the statistically unusual clusterings of cases within a large hierarchy are detected. Tree-temporal scan statistic with a self-controlled design makes within-person comparisons among time periods, therefore all time-invariant confounders were adjusted. We only calculated the number of events within the risk or control window for vaccinated individuals. The cases of any event among unvaccinated people are not measured. The null hypothesis is that there is no unusual temporal clustering of events on any leaf or branch across the study time period, while the alternative hypothesis is that there is at least one cut on a leaf or a branch having a temporal clustering of events for some time windows. This method is useful when it is difficult to set a risk window due to a lack of safety information because it is not necessary to set a well-defined risk section in advance. By using the method, we can find out whether the influenza vaccine causes a very specific reaction, such as acute disseminated encephalitis (lower level) or a broader group of related AEs, such as inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (higher level).Poisson generalized log likelihood ratios (LLRs) test statistic for each tree node and time interval was calculated. We conditioned on the number of cases observed in each node of the tree as well as the total number of events occurring on each day during the follow-up period. The number of Monte Carlo replications selected for this analysis was 9999 to obtain a p-value for the detected temporal cluster in a situation where the distribution of the test statistic was not known16. This adjusts for the multiple testing by comparing the test statistics generated from the real dataset with test statistics generated from all other random datasets. We detected temporal clusters with p ≤ 0.05 as signals. Attributable risk was calculated by dividing the excess number of cases by the total number of cancer patients exposed to flu vaccine26.The analysis was conducted using SAS enterprise guide version 7.1 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and TreeScan software v2.1 (https://www.treescan.org).Ethics statementThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Ewha Womans University (ewha-202210-0005-01) and received a waiver of informed consent because we used the linked databases containing anonymized data that cannot allow patients’ identification. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.ResultsDuring the study period, a total of 7,970,157 doses of influenza vaccine were received by the elderly (3,872,631 doses in the 2016/2017 season; 4,097,526 doses in the 2017/2018 season). Among these, 431,276 doses administered to cancer patients were included in the analysis (208,938 doses in the 2016/2017 season; 222,338 doses in the 2017/2018 season). The flow chart is presented in Fig. 2. Note that most vaccinations occurred in September (81,517; 18.9%) or October (326,725; 75.8%), and the number of men (260,205; 60.3%) was higher than that of women (171,071; 39.7%) (Table 1).Figure 2Flow chart for the inclusion of eligible patients.Full size imageTable 1 Descriptive characteristics related to first doses of influenza vaccine in the elderly cancer patients during 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 flu seasons.Full size tableWithin the observation period, 667,323 incidence AEs associated with 1582 ICD-10 codes were identified. Table 2 lists all diagnoses included in the most likely cuts, meaning that the clusters of cases were least likely to occur by chance. Even though the most likely cuts have an excess rate, as shown in Table 2, there will invariably be some area with a rate higher than expected purely by chance alone under the null hypothesis26. There was only one diagnosis which presented statistical alerts (p ≤ 0.05); ‘other dorsopathies’ on 1–15 days following vaccination. We found 197 cases in the risk window (days 1–15 after vaccination) and 563 cases in the control window (days 16–84 after vaccination). However, more specific codes on the lower levels in this branch were not detected as signals. The attributable risk of other dorsopathies per 100,000 influenza vaccinees was 16.5. The temporal distribution of the occurrence of the disease from the date of influenza vaccination is presented in Fig. 3. Other dorsopathies showed a higher distribution of the number of patients in the early stages of vaccination, and the number of cases varied from 1 to 18 cases per day.Table 2 List of adverse events from tree-temporal scan statistical analysis of influenza vaccination in elderly cancer patients, from the 2016/2017 through 2017/2018 flu seasons.Full size tableFigure 3Temporal distribution of ‘other dorsopathies’ cases according to the number of days to diagnosis after influenza vaccination among elderly cancer patients.Full size imageAccording to the subgroup analysis by flu season, there was no statistically significant signal. The most likely cuts included ‘other dorsopathies’, but with no statistical significance; 61 cases in days 1–8 following vaccination in the 2016/17 season (P = 0.953) and 76 cases in days 1–11 following vaccination in 2017/18 season (P = 0.986).DiscussionThis study delineated whether there were potentially increased adverse events following influenza vaccination in elderly cancer patients based on the nationwide Korean population. With a self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistical method, we found one signal of a potential adverse event in the ICD-10 coding system within 15 days after vaccination. Using this method, we could not find evidence that influenza vaccine was associated with any adverse events in the first 6 weeks after vaccination, other than ‘other dorsopathies’.Other dorsopathies include a wide range of disease areas, including cervical disc disorders, other intervertebral disc disorders, and dorsalgia. Although in this study, among the patients diagnosed with ‘other dorsopathies (M50-M54)’, patients diagnosed with ‘dorsalgia (M54)’ during the observation period contributed a lot (527 patients), but they did not correspond to a likely cut. Since no significant cuts were found in other diagnosis codes related to dorsopathies, it is hard to explain that influenza vaccination is related to a risk of a specific type of backache in cancer patients.Dorsopathy, including back pain, is one of the adverse events of influenza vaccines specified in Micromedex, with cases reported from 1 to 21 days following vaccination in randomized clinical trials. The actual incidence rate has not been precisely known. However, there were few case reports of severe neurological diseases in patients who have experienced back pain symptoms after influenza vaccination. According to case reports, patients were diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD)27, acute fulminant myocarditis28, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis29 a few days after experiencing upper or lower back pain after vaccination with inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccination. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research on the risk of other serious neurological diseases accompanied by back pain. Additionally, further pharmacoepidemiological studies are needed to evaluate whether the risk of developing dorsopathies is particularly increased by influenza vaccination in cancer patients.The current study makes a unique contribution to the safety profile of influenza vaccination for elderly cancer patients in several aspects. First, the self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistic method has been identified as one of the good signal-detection methods to generate hypotheses in previous studies. Unlike most vaccine safety studies, we did not limit the assessment to a few health outcomes. It is the first study to evaluate all possible adverse events following influenza vaccination in elderly cancer patients in Korea using this method. Second, since data on all elderly cancer patients in Korea were used, relatively rare adverse reactions were identified, and the results were highly representative. Even though the claims data were used, the validity of cancer diagnosis was relatively secured because the rare incurable disease registration code was used to define cancer patients.Despite these strengths, some limitations still remain. First of all, we assessed potential adverse events occurring only within 6 weeks of vaccination. Therefore, we might have missed an increased risk of a true adverse event whose period of risk was beyond 6 weeks or whose risk was constant throughout the follow-up period. In addition, the fact that most of the influenza vaccines evaluated in this study are typically administered in the fall may cause time-varying confounding, which generates a false safety signal. Although it did not emerge in this study, in-depth and customized interpretation will be required when interpreting signals related to exposures with temporal trends, such as influenza vaccines. Moreover, the validity of the entire diagnostic code in health insurance data has not been evaluated. Although previous studies evaluating the validity in claims data in Korea showed high reliability for several diseases such as cancer, acute myocardial infraction, stroke, and inflammatory bowel disease30,31,32,33, attention needs to be paid to the interpretation of our findings that have screened all diagnostic codes using the tree-temporal scan statistic method. The last thing to note is that detected signals do not mean causality between influenza vaccination and adverse events. To examine causation and the exact time period of increased risk of adverse events in elderly cancer patients, further pharmacoepidemiological studies are needed.In conclusion, we identified 1 known safety signal within 12 weeks after vaccination for elderly cancer patients using the self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistic method. Overall, our findings provide reassurance of the safety of influenza vaccine in the elderly cancer patient population. In addition to all cancer patients, additional research is needed on whether there is a difference in adverse reaction signals according to cancer types. Given that the influenza vaccine formulations change annually, continuously monitoring of the risk of adverse events during future flu seasons is necessary. Further studies are needed to validate safety signals detected and conduct rigorous future epidemiological studies that incorporate adjustment of confounding factors and employ outcome definitions based on validated algorithms.

View: Text | PDF Research Article Pulmonology Rescue of alveolar wall liquid secretion blocks fatal lung injury due to influenza-staphylococcal coinfection Text PDF Abstract Secondary lung infection by inhaled Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a common and lethal event for individuals infected with influenza A virus (IAV). How IAV disrupts host defense to promote SA infection in lung alveoli, where fatal lung injury occurs, is not known. We addressed this issue using real-time determinations of alveolar responses to IAV in live, intact, perfused lungs. Our findings show that IAV infection blocked defensive alveolar wall liquid (AWL) secretion and induced airspace liquid absorption, thereby reversing normal alveolar liquid dynamics and inhibiting alveolar clearance of inhaled SA. Loss of AWL secretion resulted from inhibition of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel in the alveolar epithelium, and airspace liquid absorption was caused by stimulation of the alveolar epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Loss of AWL secretion promoted alveolar stabilization of inhaled SA, but rescue of AWL secretion protected against alveolar SA stabilization and fatal SA-induced lung injury in IAV-infected mice. These findings reveal a central role for AWL secretion in alveolar defense against inhaled SA and identify AWL inhibition as a critical mechanism of IAV lung pathogenesis. AWL rescue may represent a new therapeutic approach for IAV-SA coinfection. Authors Stephanie Tang, Ana Cassandra De Jesus, Deebly Chavez, Sayahi Suthakaran, Sarah K.L.

There might be an interplay between adipose tissue and respiratory pathogens, although the mechanism is unknown. Proinflammatory factors secreted by the adipose tissue are often discussed to serve as indirect contributor to virus infection. However, the direct potential of adipose tissue to serve as a viral niche has not yet been investigated.MethodsTwo murine obesity models (DIO and ob/ob) were infected with influenza A virus (IAV) and monitored for 3 weeks. p.i. Lung and adipose tissue were harvested, and the viral load was analysed. Direct replication of IAV in vitro was investigated in human derived primary adipocytes and macrophages. The indirect impact of the secretory products of adipocytes during infection was analysed in a co-culture system with lung fibroblasts. Moreover, lung and adipose tissue was harvested from deceased patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant. Additionally, replication of SARS-CoV-2 alpha, delta, and omicron variants was investigated in vitro in adipocytes and macrophages.ResultsBoth murine obesity models presented high IAV titers compared to non-obese mice. Interestingly, adipose tissue adjacent to the lungs was a focal point for influenza virus replication in mice. We further detected IAV replication and antiviral response in human adipocytes. Co-cultivation of adipocytes and lung fibroblasts led to increased IL-8 concentration during infection. Though we observed SARS-CoV-2 in the thoracic adipose tissue of COVID-19 patients, no active replication was found in adipocytes in vitro. However, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the macrophages and this finding was associated with increased inflammation.ConclusionsOur study revealed that thoracic adipose tissue contributes to respiratory virus infection. Besides indirect induction of proinflammatory factors during infection, adipocytes and macrophages within the tissue can directly support viral replication.

In 2009, a new influenza A virus (IAV) strain caused an influenza pandemic and recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) created a global health emergency [2, 3]. Epidemiological profiles of these viral infections have disclosed heretofore unknown potential risk factors for severe illness. In addition to crucial comorbidities such as age and immunosuppression, obesity is apparently another independent risk factor for severe viral respiratory infection [4, 5]. Recently, epidemiological data revealed associations among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), high body mass index (BMI), and mortality [5].As of 2016, there were over 1.9 billion adults with overweight worldwide and the number of persons with obesity has tripled since 1975 [6]. In general, obesity is a condition characterized by an abnormal and excessive increase in adipose tissue mass beyond physical requirements [7, 8]. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity and overweight as excessive fat accumulation leading to elevated morbidity rates for various health problems [6]. Adipose tissue stores metabolic energy and also functions as an endocrine gland secreting various factors that cause low-grade inflammation [6]. Moreover, it expresses macrophage-related proinflammatory genes [9]. Sun et al. proposed that adipocyte death, chemotactic regulation, hypoxia, and fatty acid flux are key potential initiators of macrophage immigration in adipose tissue [10].The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of adipose tissue in the context of lung infections. Interestingly, our results demonstrated that adipose tissue is a site of replication for influenza viruses but not for SARS-CoV-2. However, adipocytes and macrophages contribute to the inflammation associated with these infections.MethodsViral strains and plaque assayH1N1 influenza strain Influenza A/Jena/5852/09 (variant) HA-G222 (pdmH1N1) was isolated as previously described and used for in vivo infection [11]. All in vitro infections were performed using the H1N1 influenza A virus/Puerto Rico/8/34 (IAV/PR8) strain. IAV strains were propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells kindly provided by the Section of Experimental Virology, Institute of Medical Microbiology and cultivated in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM) (Lonza Group, Allendale, NJ, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAN-Biotech GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany) and 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza Group).SARS-CoV-2 variants SARS-CoV-2/hu/Germany/Jena-vi005588/2020 (alpha variant, GenBank MW633324.1) and SARS-CoV-2/human/DEU/vi0114749/2021 (delta variant, GenBank ON650061.1) were isolated from respiratory specimens of patients at the Jena University Hospital (ethics approval No. 2018-1263) as previously described [12]. SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant (human, 2021, Germany, B.1.1.529) was acquired from the European Virus Archive Global (EvaG; Marseille, France) and propagated in Vero-ACE2 cells (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin, and 125 µg/mL Hygromycin B Gold (InvivoGen). Standard plaque assays were performed either on MDCK (IAV) or Vero-76 (SARS-CoV-2) cells as previously described [12, 13]. Both used cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma.Mouse models and infectionIn vivo experiments were approved by the Office for Consumer Protection of Thuringia (TV-Nr: 02-018/16). All animal studies were non-randomized and no blinding was done.The diet-induced-obesity (DIO) model, female BALB/cJRj wild type (WT) mice age 5 weeks were procured from Janvier Labs (Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France). For 12 weeks, they were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) (ssniff Spezialdiäten GmbH, Soest, Germany) consisting of 60 kJ% fat, 20 kJ% protein, and 20 kJ% carbohydrates. Equation 1 shows the formula used to confirm obesity: Obese ≥ mean (body weight NFD) + 3 × SD (body weight NFD). Mice that did not meet the criterion for the high-fat diet (HFD) were excluded from the analysis. The sample size for uninfected control mice consisted of n = 3 for the non-obese group and n = 6 for the HFD group at each time point. For infected mice, the sample size was scheduled as n = 20 for the non-obese group and n = 40 for the HFD group at each time point.Female ob/ob C57Bl/6 mice characterized by global leptin KO (B6.V-Lep ob/ob JRj; age 8 weeks; Janvier Labs) and lean heterozygote control mice (B6.V-Lep ob/+ JRj témoin; age 8 weeks; Janvier Labs) were used as secondary murine obesity models. The sample size for uninfected control mice was n = 5 for both genotypes. For infected mice, the sample size was n = 10 for the non-obese group and n = 10 for the HFD group at each time point.Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and intranasally infected with 106 plaque forming units (PFU) HA-G222-mpJena/5258 strain diluted in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl. Body weight and overall burden score were measured daily for 21 days (Table S1). Active viral particles and cytokines were analyzed in the right inferior lung lobes. Therefore, tissue was homogenized in the appropriate amount of cell culture medium EMEM (Lonza Group) to adjust each specimen to its weight in mg. After homogenization, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm, and cell-free supernatants were stored at −80 °C until assay performance. The number of infectious virus particles in PFU per ml was determined by standard plaque assay. To analyze gene expression in the extracted abdominal and thoracic adipose tissue, the samples were homogenized in RLT buffer prior to RNA extraction.COVID-19 patient autopsy and tissue processingAutopsies were conducted at the very early postmortem stage by two experienced forensic pathologists. The general study protocol was approved by the local ethics board under registration No. 2020-1773 and included recording relevant metadata and validating native and nonfixed tissue and organ samples [14]. Pericardium, epicardium, mediastinum/periaortic, and mesenterium (fatty tissues) as well as right superior lobes, right middle lobes, right inferior lobes, left superior lobes, and left inferior lobes (lungs) were collected from five COVID-19 patients (Table S2).Human primary adipocyte differentiation and infectionHuman white preadipocytes and their corresponding incubation media were obtained from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany) and negative tested for mycoplasma. Differentiation was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. S1). Mature adipocytes were infected with IAV/PR8 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Cells were incubated with viral dilutions prepared in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA; Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany), 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.9 mM CaCl2 at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 followed by a wash step with DPBS. Afterwards, cells were incubated in adipocyte nutrition medium supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM CaCl2, and 30 ng L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 day and 3 days. Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 alpha, delta, and omicron variants was performed at MOI1. Cells were infected with virus diluted in adipocyte nutrition medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS for 60 min. After one washing step cells were cultured in nutrition medium for 1 day and 3 days.Detection of sialic acid residues as cell receptors for IAV hemagglutininTo assess the abundance of sialic acid (SA) residues attached to galactose in differentiated human primary adipocytes, we employed specific, biotinylated lectins. Sambucus Nigra Lectin (SNA, VEC-B-1305-2, Biozol, Eching Germany) was used to detect α-2,6-linked SA, while Maackia Amurensis Lectin II (MAL II, VEC-B-1265-1, Biozol) to detect α-2,3-linked SAs. Differentiated adipocytes were seeded on coverslips in 24-well plates and fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Following fixation, cells were blocked with 3% BSA for 30 min at RT and then incubated with SNA (1:100) or MAL II (1:100). After three washing steps, cells were incubated with Streptavidin−Cy3™ (1:100, S6402, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and Alexa Fluor™ 488 Phalloidin (1:400; A12379, invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to visualize actin filaments for 30 min at RT. Cell slides were mounted with DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) and examined using an AxioObserver Z.1 microscope (Carl Zeiss AG).Co-culture of lung fibroblasts and mature adipocytesMature adipocytes were differentiated as described above. 48 h after adipocytes seeding, primary human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90, Coriell Institute for medical Research, Camden, USA) were seeded in Corning™ Costar™ Transwell™ dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and placed above the adipocytes containing medium. IMR-90 cells were tested negative for mycoplasma. The co-culture was subsequently cultured in adipocyte nutrition medium (Promocell). After additional 24 h, the lung fibroblast cavity was infected with IAV of an MOI of 1 in the same manner as described adipocyte section.Macrophage isolation, differentiation, and infectionPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors under ethics approval No. 2019-1519_1 and differentiated as previously described [15].Differentiated macrophages were infected with IAV (PR8) and the SARS-CoV-2 omicron and delta variants. Influenza infection was induced by incubating the cells with virus diluted in DPBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) human serum albumin (HSA; PAN-Biotech GmbH), 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.9 mM CaCl2 at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. Cells were then incubated in RPMI medium supplemented with 1 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM CaCl2, and 30 ng TPCK-treated trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 8 h and 24 h. SARS-CoV-2 stocks were diluted in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) HSA. Cells were incubated with inoculum for 60 min, washed once with DPBS, and infected for 8 h and 24 h.Protein quantification and western blottingCells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and protein concentrations was determined with BCA-assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Immunostaining was performed using primary antibodies against anti-ACE-2 (1:1,000; AF933, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and anti-β-actin (1:1,000; A1978, Sigma Aldrich) and corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-goat (HAF017, R&D Systems) or anti-mouse (172-1011, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) immunoglobulin G (IgG) secondary antibodies. Chemiluminescence was measured using Immobilon western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Merck GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) on a FusionFX imaging device (Vilber, Marne-la-Vallée, France).RNA extraction and qRT-PCRRNA was extracted with the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and determined by the ND-1000 NanoDrop spectrophotometer (PEQLAB Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) followed by a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed using a Maxima SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 100 mM each forward and reverse primer pairs (Metabion International AG, Planegg, Germany) (Table S3). qRT-PCR cycle was run on a Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen). The mRNA quantity was normalized to the β-actin housekeeping gene and all data were expressed as n-folds of the corresponding control. The ACE2 expression was normalized to the positive control Calu-3 cells.Viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen). The qRT-PCR for IAV was performed using the RIDA® GENE flu kit (R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany) to detect the M-protein (Influenza A), NP (Influenza B), and H1 (IAV subtype H1N1v) genes. The SARS-CoV-2 copies were enumerated using the RIDA® GENE SARS-CoV-2 kit (R-Biopharm AG) as previously described [14].Cytokine determinationCytokines and chemokines in adipocyte and co-culture supernatants were measured with the LEGENDplex™ human adipokine panel (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA). The inflammatory responses in the macrophage supernatants were determined with the LEGENDplex™ COVID-19 cytokine storm panel 1 (BioLegend). Each specimen was analyzed with an Accuri C6 Plus cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding LEGENDplex v. 8.0 software (BioLegend).Histology and immunofluorescenceTissue from in vivo mouse experiments and COVID-19 patient biopsies embedded in Tissue Tek O.C.T. compound was sliced into 4-µm sections with a Leica CM1950 microtome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), mounted on EprediaTM SuperfrostTM Plus adhesion microscope slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific), air-dried for 1 h, and stored at −20 °C. Mouse thoracic adipose were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) for the histological analyses.Tissue cryosections were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 10 min for immunofluorescence staining. The tissues were blocked with 3% (v/v) BSA diluted in DPBS for 1 h. The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-H1N1 influenza A virus nucleocapsid protein antibody (1:150; ab104870, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody (1:500; GTX632604, GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, sections were washed with PBS and incubated at RT for 45 min with the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor® 488 AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L; 1:500; 711-545-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) and Alexa Fluor® 488 AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L; 1:500; 115-545-146, Jackson ImmunoResearch,) as well as BODIPY™ 558/568 phalloidin (1:500; B3475, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sections were mounted with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) and imaged with AxioObserver Z.1+Apotome 2 (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).ImmunocytochemistryCells were fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton-X and blocked with 3% (v/v) BSA in PBS at RT for 30 min. Adipocyte cytoplasm was stained with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 555 (W32464, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instruction before fixation. Adipocytes and macrophages were both incubated with mouse anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody J2 (1:500; RNT-SCI-10010200, Jena Bioscience, Jena, Germany) or rabbit anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody J2 (1:500, Kf-Ab01299-23.0, kerafast, Boston, MA, USA) to detect viral RNA. Additionally, macrophages were stained with mouse anti-CD68 monoclonal antibody (1:200; 14-0688-82, Invitrogen). Both primary antibodies were diluted in 3% (v/v) BSA in PBS incubated at 4 °C overnight. Secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (711-545-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Cy-3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (715-165-150, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were each applied at 1:500 dilution. Cells were mounted with DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech) and examined with an AxioObserver Z.1 microscope (Carl Zeiss AG).Statistical analyses and scheme designStatistical analyses was performed using GraphPad Prism v. 9 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Individual values are presented either as violin plots with the median indicated by a dashed line or as bar charts displaying the mean ± standard deviation.

For this, a female BALB/c mouse DIO model was used to simulate an obesity-promoting western diet in humans (Fig. 1A). The mice in the DIO group presented with significant weight gain (p < 0.0001) and elevated blood glucose levels (p = 0.0015) compared to the control mice (Fig. 1B). A massive gain in adipose tissue largely accounted for the observed 50% increase in body weight. The adipose tissue was visible during tissue sectioning and was quantified after calculating the amount of abdominal adipose tissue extracted (p = 0.0007) (Fig. 1B). By contrast, the lung weight was relatively lower in the obese than the control mice (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1: Obesity is associated with disease progression and high viral loads in influenza virus-infected mice.A Schematic overview of non-obese and diet-induced obese (DIO), female BALB/C mice with subsequent infection with IAV. B DIO mice (n = 64) were characterized by increased body weight and blood glucose, compared non-obese (n = 46). Also, relative mass of adipose tissue extracted from the abdomen were elevated, and relative lung weights decreased in obese (n = 8) compared to non-obese (n = 6). C Schematic overview of female C57BL/6 non-obese, heterozygous (ob/+), and homozygous obese mice with global leptin knockout (ob/ob) with subsequent infection with IAV. D obese ob/ob mice (n = 20) were characterized by increased body weigh tand blood glucose compared to non-obese ob/+ mice (n = 20). Also, relative mass of adipose tissue was elevated and relative lung weights decreased in ob/ob (n = 10) compared to non-obese ob/+ (n = 10) mice. E Relative body weight and overall scoring values after infection of DIO showed a significant temporal right shift and a slower recovery after 21 days p.i. F Infection of ob/ob mice led to lesser alteration in the body weight progression but equal overall burden score progression compared to DIO. Relative lung weights were decreased in obese mice of DIO (n = 16) compared to non-obese (n = 10) (G) and ob/ob (n = 5) (H) compared to ob/+ (n = 5) mice day 4 p.i. Active virus particles determined via plaque assay of lung homogenates were significantly increased in DIO mice (G), and elevated in ob/ob mice (H). **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. P calculated by Mann–Whitney-test (B, D, G, H) and Two-way ANOVA, Šidáks multiple comparisons (E, F), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageTo confirm our findings independently in another genetic background, we also analyzed IAV infection in the monogenic ob/ob obesity model characterized by global leptin knockout (KO) (Fig. 1C) [16, 17]. To this end, we used C57Bl/6 mice which differed from the BALB/c mainly in terms of their innate immune response [18]. The leptin KO (ob/ob mutant) presented with an obese phenotype as well as corresponding metabolic alterations such as insulin resistance and hyperglycemia [19]. The ob/ob mice were characterized by elevated body weight compared to non-obese control mice (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1D). The blood glucose levels of the ob/ob mice were significantly higher than those of the control (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1D). The total adipose tissue weight was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) but the lung weight was substantially lower (p = 0.0042) in the obese than the non-obese mice (Fig. 1D).IAV pandemic H1N1 strain 2009 (pdmH1N1) was intranasally administered to the DIO- and ob/ob mouse models. The infection course was analyzed for 21 days using a predefined scoring system to evaluate disease severity based upon categories, observations, and corresponding gradings (Table S1, Fig. 1E, F).In the DIO model, the non-obese mice exhibited maximum weight loss 4 days post-infection (p.i.). By contrast, the obese mice had lost only ≤~20% of their original body weight and the weight loss peaked on day 8 (Fig. 1E). Unlike the non-obese mice, the obese mice did not recover to the control standard score until day 21. The obese mouse scores reflected a rightward shift in the infection curve and the inability to recover fully from the infection (Fig. 1E).We compared the p.i. body weights of the ob/ob and the heterozygote, non-obese control (ob/+) mice and found that symptom onset was delayed in the former (Fig. 1F). The scores demonstrated delayed but aggravated disease progression as seen with the DIO model (Fig. 1F).The lungs of the infected obese DIO (p = 0.0035) and ob/ob (p = 0.0079) mice weighed less than those of the infected non-obese mice. By day 4, however, the viral titers were significantly higher in the infected DIO mice (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1G). Virus titers in ob/ob mice showed the same tendency (Fig. 1H).Thoracic adipose tissue adjacent to the lungs harbored influenza virusInvestigation of the thoracic lumen of DIO and ob/ob mice revealed abundant adipose tissue masses between the lungs, heart, and pleura in the mediastinum (Fig. 2A). The extensive accumulation of thoracic adipose tissue and its proximity to the lungs were indicative of the close relationship between lung and fat tissue. Macroscopic images of the thoracic situs demonstrated the proximity between the lung and adipose tissue (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2: Thoracic adipose tissue adjacent to the lungs harbored influenza virus.A Image of the thorax lumen of uninfected DIO (left) and ob/ob mice (right) with H&E staining of a representative cryosection (4 µm thickness) of the extracted thoracic adipose tissue, Scale bar, 250 μm. B, C ob/ob (n = 5) mice showed increased thoracic adipose tissue mass (B) and elevated copies/mg of IAV within the extracted tissue day 4 p.i. compared to non-obese (n = 5). Extracted abdominal adipose tissue sections from obese ob/ob (D) and DIO mice (E) show upregulated mRNA levels of IL-6 and TNF-α compared to the corresponding non-obese mice. F IAV nucleoprotein (green) visualized by immunofluorescence staining detected at day 4 p.i. (arrowhead) within cryosections (4 µm) from lung and additionally extracted thoracic adipose tissue from representative ob/ob mice. Phalloidin (red) and DAPI (blue) staining were used to detect actin and the nuclei. Scale bar 100 μm. P calculated by Mann-Whitney-test (B, D, E). *P < 0.05**P < 0.01.Full size imageThe ob/ob mice presented with significantly more thoracic adipose tissue adjacent to the lungs than the ob/+ mice 4 day p.i. (p = 0.0079) (Fig. 2B). In obese mice, then, elevated viral RNA could be correlated with simultaneous increases in thoracic adipose tissue (Fig. 2C), yet reaching no significant level (p = 0.0794)We measured the interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) expression levels in the adipose tissue of the mice. The IL-6 (p = 0.0108) and TNF-α levels (p = 0.0075) were higher in the adipose tissue of the obese (ob/ob) than the non-obese (ob/+) mice (Fig. 2C). This was consistent in the DIO model (Fig. 2D, IL-6 (p = 0.0444), TNF- α (p = 0.0238)). Moreover, in the thoracic adipose tissue, we detected significantly elevated TNF-α levels in ob/ob mice (p = 0.0286, Fig. S2A) and elevated IL-6 levels in DIO mice (p = 0.0079, Fig. S2B). We also prepared cryosections of the left lung lobes and thoracic adipose tissue of the infected mice. Immunofluorescence staining of the tissue sections revealed positive signal for the viral protein in the lungs on day 4 and even on day 21 in the obese ob/ob mice (Fig. 2D, upper panel). Influenza virus was also detected in the thoracic adipose tissue of the same mice (Fig. 2D, lower panel).Influenza virus replicated in human primary adipocytesWe differentiated primary human preadipocytes to mature adipocytes (Fig. 3A). The maturation process was monitored by observing intracellular lipid droplet development and the loss of the fibroblast morphology of the cells (Fig. S1). Subsequently, we infected the mature adipocytes with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (IAV/H1N1/PR8) and measured the viral titers after 1 day and 3 days.Fig. 3: Influenza virus replicated in human primary adipocytes.A Schematic overview of the experimental setup for the infection of primary derived adipocytes differentiated from preadipocytes and the subsequent infection with IAV (PR8) for 1 and 3 days with an MOI (Multiplicity of infection) of 1. B Active virus particles detected by standard plaque assay from supernatants of infected adipocytes were significantly increased after 1 and 3 days of infection with PR8 with an MOI of 1. C dsRNA (green) of IAV could be visualized by immune fluorescence staining within infected adipocytes day 3 p.i., mainly located at the lipid droplets and already damaged nucleus within the cells. Cytoplasm (red) was stained wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and the nuclei (blue) with DAPI. Scale bars, 20 μm. D Infected adipocytes secreted significantly more IFN-γ, 1 day p.i. and more MCP-1, IP-10 3 days p.i. E Schematic illustration of the infection of primary lung fibroblasts co-cultivated in a trans-well system with adipocytes with IAV of an MOI of 1. F No differences in virus titer were determined via plaque assay in the co-culture compared to the mono-culture of solely lung fibroblasts. G Co-culture of adipocytes with lung fibroblasts led to a significant upregulation of IL-8 in the supernatants at 24 h p.i. H Presence of α-2,6-linked (SNA) and α-2,3 linked (MAL II) SA residues in differentiated human adipocytes stained with biotinylated lectins and the corresponding fluophore-linked streptavidin. Actin filaments were stained with phalloidin (green) and the nuclei (blue) with DAPI. Scale bars, 50 µm. Data presented as Mean ± SD and presentative of three independent biological replicates; P calculated by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, Šidáks multiple comparisons test (B), Tukeys’ multiple comparisons test (D); Mann-Whitney test (F), and Ordinary one-way ANOVA (G); *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageViral titers were significantly higher in the IAV-infected adipocytes compared to mock. Hence, positive viral replication had occurred on days 1 and 3 p.i. (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescence staining of double-stranded (ds)RNA occurs exclusively during single-stranded (ss)RNA virus replication. Clear signals were detected on day 3 in the adipocytes infected with IAV (Fig. 3C). Moreover, significant interferon gamma (IFN-γ) upregulation in the cellular supernatants at 24 h p.i. (p = 0.0329) could be observed. Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) 1 (p = 0.0006) and IFN-γ-induced protein (IP)-10 (p = 0.0079) were significantly upregulated after 3 days p.i. (Fig. 3D).The adipocyte/human primary lung fibroblast co-culture was used to assess the impact of inflammatory active adipocytes on influenza virus replication. We infected co-cultivated lung fibroblasts with IAV for 24 h and evaluated the influence of inflammatory active human primary adipocytes in a transwell system (Fig. 3E). The viral titers did not significantly differ between the single-cultured fibroblasts and the co-culture system (Fig. 3F). Nevertheless, we observed synergy between the co-cultured cells. Significant upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 was detected in the infected co-culture compared to non-infected cells (p < 0.0153) (Fig. 3G). In addition, we also quantified levels of IL-6 and MCP-1 in the supernatants. Although there was a slight upward trend observed in infected lung fibroblast, we did not observe a significant difference compared to the co-cultured cells (Fig. S2).During the cell entry of influenza A viruses, the hemagglutinin molecules in the virus envelope recognize terminal SA residues with an α-2,3 and α-2,6 linkage of surface glycoconjugates [20]. In order to confirm the active replication of IAV in mature adipocytes, we performed additional fluorescent staining to visualize the presence of SA residues. Notably, the cells exhibited a prominent signal for α-2,6-linked SA in close proximity to intracellular lipid droplets, while the detection of α-2,3-linked SA was observed to a lesser extent (Fig. 3H).SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the thoracic adipose tissue of COVID-19 patientsWe examined biopsies from five deceased COVID-19 patients and analyzed various lung areas and the thoracic adipose tissues (Fig. 4A). In all areas, SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant could be confirmed by measuring SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration (Fig. 4A, B). The highest amount of viral RNA was detected in the left lower lung lobes (Fig. 4B). However, high concentrations were also found in the mediastinal adipose tissue (Fig. 4B) and immunofluorescence staining revealed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein there (Fig. 4C). Immunofluorescence staining disclosed potential macrophage/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein colocalization (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the thoracic adipose tissue of COVID-19 patients.A Schematic overview of the localization of the lung and adipose tissues biopsies taken from the thorax of five deceased COVID patients. B SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected within different areas of the lung and in extracted thoracic adipose tissue (TAT) samples. C Virus particles were detected in cryosections from TAT (mediastinum) determined by immunofluorescence staining of the spike protein (green), actin (phalloidin, red) and nuclei (DAPI, blue) compared to the corresponding negative control (upper panel). Additional staining of CD68 from macrophages revealed the potential colocalization of macrophages and spike protein within TAT (mediastinum). Scale bar, 100 µm (lower panel). D Proinflammatory markers IL-6, G-CSF, MCP-1, and IP-10 were higher in homogenized tissue from TAT (mediastinum) compared to biopsies from the left inferior lung lobe (LIL). Data presented as Mean ± SD. P calculated by Ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), multiple comparisons; **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.Full size imageThe thoracic and especially the mediastinal adipose tissue were in a highly active inflammatory state as proinflammatory factors were detected in them. The mediastinal adipose tissue exhibited high SARS-CoV-2 loads (Fig. 4D). In addition, IL-6 (p = 0.0026), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (p = 0.0001), and MCP-1 (p = 0.0001) were significantly upregulated in the mediastinal adipose tissue compared to the examined lung tissue. IP-10 levels were additionally upregulated yet reaching no significant level.SARS-CoV-2 variants did not replicate in human primary adipocytesTo demonstrate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to replicate in adipose tissue, we infected human primary adipocytes with the SARS-CoV-2 alpha, delta, and omicron variants for 24 h and 72 h (Fig. 5A). Viral particles were detected on day 1 p.i. Nevertheless, the levels of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant had significantly declined after 3 days (p < 0.0001). This decline was also seen for the alpha variant (Fig. 5C).Fig. 5: SARS-CoV-2 variants did not replicate in human primary adipocytes.A Schematic overview of the experimental setup for the infection of primary derived adipocytes differentiated from preadipocytes and the subsequent infection with the SARS-CoV-2 variants alpha, delta, and omicron for 1 and 3 days. B Active virus particles of the alpha and delta variant were detected 1 day p.i. but decreased until day 3 p.i. C dsRNA (green) of SARS-CoV-2 of all three variants were not visible within the infected adipocytes after day 3 determined by immunofluorescent staining of infected cells compared to uninfected mock cells. D mRNA expression of was not detected in human primary adipocytes compared to Calu-3 cells as positive control. E Western blot analysis of the ACE-2 protein revealed no expression in adipocytes compared to the Calu-3 positive control. Actin served as loading control. Data presented as Mean ± SD and presentative of two independent experiments for each variant; P calculated by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (B) and Mann–Whitney test (D); ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageThe omicron variant titer could not determine by plaque assay, due to the inability to induce a strong cytopathic effect [21, 22]. Hence, we did not perform the plaque assay but evaluated the dsRNA for all variants by immunofluorescence staining and could not detect dsRNA within the cells (Fig. 5C).Additionally, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor mRNA in adipocytes was analyzed. Compared to Calu-3 cells, used as a positive control, no mRNA expression was detectable (p = 0.05). Moreover, no ACE-2 protein was determined in adipocytes (Fig. 5D, E).Macrophages contributed to inflammation even in the absence of active viral replicationImmunofluorescence staining of the adipose tissue from deceased COVID-19 patients revealed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein colocalization with the macrophage marker CD68 (Fig. 4C). To explore the possibility that IAV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate inside macrophages, we examined human monocyte-derived macrophages at 8 h and 24 h p.i. (Fig. 6A).Fig. 6: Macrophages contributed to inflammation even in the absence of active viral replication.A Schematic overview of the experimental setup for the infection of macrophages derived from isolated PBMCs from a healthy donor with subsequent infection with IAV and SARS-CoV-2 (delta and omicron) for 8 and 24 h. B Active virus particles of IAV were detected after 8 and 24 h, whereas SARS-CoV-2 (delta) particles decreased from 8 to 24 h. C Viral RNA was determined extracellular (extra) and intracellular (intra) of infected macrophages. D dsRNA (green) of both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV detected by immune fluorescence staining within PBMCs stained with CD68 (red) and DAPI (blue) 24 h p.i. Scale bars 20 µm. E Proinflammatory markers MCP-1, IL-8, and IP-10 were significantly upregulated in supernatants of macrophages infected with the omicron variant. SARS-CoV-2 (omicron) and IAV led to increased relative cytotoxicity measured by Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-assay in cell supernatants 24 h p.i. Data presented as Mean ± SD and presentative of three independent experiments for each variant; P calculated by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (B, E), Ordinary one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparisons (C), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.Full size imageWe identified active IAV and SARS-CoV-2 (delta) particles at 8 h p.i. However, only IAV could still be detected after 24 h p.i. albeit at a lower level than at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 6B). We additionally measured the intracellular and extracellular RNA levels of all virus variants. Neither concentration increased over time (Fig. 6C). On the other hand, immunofluorescence staining disclosed IAV and SARS-CoV-2 dsRNA within the macrophages (Fig. 6D).The macrophages infected with the omicron variant presented an increase in proinflammatory response. Here, MCP-1 (p = 0.0012), IL-8 (p = 0.0007), and IP-10 (p = 0.0003) levels 24 h p.i. could be identified (Fig. 6E). A lactate dehydrogenase assay showed significantly elevated macrophage damage in response to IAV (p = 0.0424) and SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant (p = 0.0063) infection (Fig. 6E).DiscussionThe association between obesity and severe respiratory infections first became evident during the 2009 influenza virus pandemic and once again during the more recent COVID-19 pandemic. To identify the pathophysiological factors linking obesity and viral respiratory infections, we used two distinct murine obesity models for influenza virus infection and completed our findings by using human-specific primary cells. To investigate the interaction of adipose tissue with further RNA-viruses, we analyzed deceased COVID-19 patients and performed SARS-CoV-2 in vitro experiments.In this study, we investigated whether various obesity-related mechanisms contribute to the progression of respiratory infections. By using two distinct mouse obesity models for influenza virus infection, an increase of infection severity accompanied with a protracted disease progression with elevated viral titer in obese animals could be clearly demonstrated. These results were corroborated by other studies showing overall increased mortality in obese DIO mice infected with a pdmH1N1 strain [23,24,25,26]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to demonstrate a prolonged course of influenza virus infection in obese animals (Fig. 1).Interestingly, we detected influenza virus particles in the thoracic adipose tissue adjacent to the lungs and confirmed a replication in the adipose tissue near the lungs (Fig. 2). In this context, previous studies have reported the detection of virus particles in different parts of omental adipose tissue in mice infected with an avian influenza subtype (H5N1) [27]. Hence, the massive lipid expansion that occurs in patients with obesity provides a viral replication site in close proximity to the lungs that may directly affect the course of viral infection. This finding may provide a potential explanation for the observed increased shedding of IAV in symptomatic patients with obesity [28]. The infection of human primary adipocytes with IAV clearly identified a possible virus replication (Fig. 3). This finding is consistent with previously published studies positive influenza signals in differentiated IAV and as well as other pathogens, such as CMV or Adenovirus [29]. However, conditioned media of the adipocytes had no effect on viral replication in primary lung fibroblasts in a co-culture system (Fig. 3E). One limitation of this study is the use of a human influenza isolate for the in vitro studies and the mouse-adapted strain for the in vivo infection models, even though both strains belong to the same H1N1 subtype.Nevertheless, our results demonstrated that proinflammatory factors and inflammatory activity were highly upregulated in abdominal adipose tissue of ob/ob mice. These findings corroborated those of prior studies. An earlier work indicated that adipose tissue had high proinflammatory activity in obesity and suggested that the low-grade inflammation associated with obesity is critical in the course of pneumonia [10].In order to transfer our findings to other RNA viruses, we analyzed the thoracic adipose tissue of five deceased COVID-19 patients with obesity (Fig. 4). All patients were infected with the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings clearly showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in the adipose tissue adjacent to the lung. The mediastinal/periaortic adipose tissue showed very high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proinflammatory proteins, aligning with the concepts previously summarized by Ryan and Caplice that the dissemination of virus particles to adipose tissue and subsequent pro-inflammatory response could be a contributing factor to the increased risk observed in individuals with obesity for COVID-19 [30]. However, we could neither detect ACE-2 mRNA nor protein in our in vitro experiments by using adipocytes (Fig. 5E, F). It has been previously reported that adipose tissue, particularly during obesity, serves as a potential reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 due to the upregulation of ACE-2 mRNA [31]. Based on our results, we cannot identify adipocytes as the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 replication in connection to the obesity risk factor.This lack of ACE-2 receptor protein is consistent with the detected decline of viral titers of different SARS-CoV-2 variants in human primary adipocytes. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining revealed no dsRNA (Fig. 5). In contrast, Zickler et al. reported active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in adipocytes and intriguingly used IAV as negative control for the infection [32]. However, it is important to note that adipose tissue consists not only of adipocytes but also of macrophages [33]. Therefore, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the thoracic adipose tissue of deceased patients may originate co-localization of spike protein with macrophages (Fig. 4). Hence, we infected human monocyte-derived macrophages with SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, omicron variant was detected in the macrophages and an upregulation of proinflammatory factors could observed (Fig. 6).The present study demonstrated a direct association between obesity and pneumonia by showing that IAV infects adipocytes which may, in turn, serve as reservoirs for replicating viral particles. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in thoracic adipose tissue, might be mainly explained by the macrophages within the tissue and not the adipocytes.Our data demonstrate that certain respiratory viruses replicate in human primary adipocytes. This discovery identified a novel source for respiratory virus that contributes to the viral load within the thorax. Moreover, our findings revealed that thoracic adipose tissue is an important source for respiratory viruses, functions as a niche for virus particles, and might account for the prolonged course of certain respiratory infections. Future research should, therefore, endeavor to design, optimize, and validate innovative therapeutic strategies that eliminate the viral reservoirs in thoracic adipose tissue.

WAHIS is the most comprehensive and only global source of information pertaining to poultry and wild bird case numbers. However, despite these data being used for response planning, the collation of case data are not within its design. As such, case data reporting is inconsistent and it may include all observed carcasses, only those tested and confirmed, or no information on numbers at all. For instance, the outbreaks comprising 24,463 Cape cormorants (Phalacrocorax capensis) in South Africa and 9,029 common cranes (Grus grus) in Israel appear to be reported in full. More widespread is the reporting of only fractions of cases compared to what is stated in the media2 or in publications. For example, in the WAHIS database there are 35 HPAI notifications since 1 October 2021 for Sandwich terns (Thalasseus sandvicensis) that involve 61 individuals globally. This contrasts sharply with reports of more than 20,000 Sandwich tern carcasses in Europe3. Similarly, 47 dead great skuas (Stercorarius skua) have been reported to WAHIS, whereas 1,400 dead individuals were found on the Scottish island of Foula alone4. Finally, in some cases, outbreaks are reported only in the literature and not in WAHIS, such as the 2,140 great white pelicans (Pelecanus onocrotalus) found dead in Mauritania in 2021 (ref. 5).Humans report outbreaks and the correlation between the distribution of wildlife cases reported and human population density strongly suggests the potential for vast underreporting in sparsely populated areas (Fig. 1d). Combined with the high underreporting of outbreaks in areas where human population densities are high (for example, the case of the Sandwich terns), this suggests that only a fraction of outbreaks in wildlife have been detected and appropriately reported. This means that the number of wild birds affected is entirely unknown but is certainly more than the tens of thousands that have been reported and collated in WAHIS.

Rohde, PhD, MS, SM (ASCP) CM, SVCM, MBCM, FACSc: Dr Welch, what social determinants, and maybe you can define that for our audience, are associated with lower rates of flu immunizations? Things like access to care, health literacy, where they live, their economic standing. And really, what can we strategy wise do to mitigate some of that?Adam C. Welch, PharmD, MBA, FAPhA: There are several social determinants. We can look at race and ethnicity. We know that African Americans are more likely to be hospitalized due to influenza than Caucasians. We can also look at more social aspects; the lack of access to health care, lack of health care insurance, people’s misinformation about vaccines. There is this general distrust of the medical system and medical institutions, and missed opportunities to vaccinate, so they were seeing a provider during flu season and they did not get the vaccine, all of these things are contributing to people not getting vaccinated. There’s a recommendation for a universal influenza vaccine for people 6 months and older. That’s almost everyone in this country. Not nearly everyone in this country is getting the flu vaccine. Data from 2021-2022 season [showed] 54% of the white population had gotten vaccinated, 54% of the Asian population, [and] it’s in the 40% for African Americans and Alaska Native, American Indians, and even less for the Hispanic population. So there’s a long way to go to get people vaccinated because we’re seeing these complications from influenza in certain demographics, certain socially vulnerable populations. We still have work to do.Rodney E. Rohde, PhD, MS, SM (ASCP) CM, SVCM, MBCM, FACSc: Thoughts on this topic?Chad Worz, PharmD, BCGP, FASCP: It comes back to that relationship word again. Randy talks about community. How do we get into the communities within the communities? How do we have relationships or find people that have relationships? We talked a lot during COVID-19 about using religion as a way to penetrate some of these hard to get to areas. We’ve done a study at ASCP [the American Society for Clinical Pathology], looking at USA boxing, and the boxing community as a way to pair vaccinations with a tight community that will listen to themselves if you present these opportunities, and they’ll talk about it. I think it’s finding those ways to really penetrate the different idiosyncrasies and unique factors of communities and find those people that they trust and get the message out.Randy McDonough, PharmD, MS, BCGP, BCPS, FAPhA: When we did our study, we did look at social determinants of health. Now, these are patients that we have access to which is interesting, and we found 3 main areas, homelessness which totally shocked me that I had patients who are homeless. We had a lack of transportation and unaffordability, and all those things were preventing them from accessing health care. But what we learned, that was before COVID-19, but then when we got into COVID-19, and we started working with the Social Services Department, we started working with Johnson County Public Health, we started recognizing that there’s a whole group of patients that just are not accessing anything. Again, how do we work with these different organizations to reach out to these patients? What I’m excited about is the whole community health worker aspect, because its not just technicians, other people are being trained as community health workers. They’re the ones who are going to be reaching out to the patient, meet them where they’re at, and then connect them with the resource within that community. I just think that that’s going to open up a lot of opportunities out there.Adam C. Welch, PharmD, MBA, FAPhA: The CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] has $150 million initiative called Partnering for Vaccine Equity, and part of the foundation of that is what you just mentioned, establish a trusted messenger. It may not be us as pharmacists. It’s typically someone who looks like the patient or sounds like the patient and can relate with them, but partner with them within the community and build that message through that trusted messenger and get people thinking about the influenza vaccine.Randy McDonough, PharmD, MS, BCGP, BCPS, FAPhA: As I said, there’s a lot of opportunity with this too, within pharmacy, with the CDC having a lot of funds out there, that are given to the public health departments locally at the state level to address some of these things, and how maybe pharmacy can be part of that solution. So they should probably be looking at their local public health department right now.Rodney E. Rohde, PhD, MS, SM (ASCP) CM, SVCM, MBCM, FACSc: I always talk about it with respect to even other issues, antibiotic stewardship. We know that’s an issue in the country and things like that, but I refer to it and I’m aware of the CDC study that’s kind of a champion. It’s probably not us. It may be Magic Johnson. Have you seen some of the commercials he’s doing [on] RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] conversation, I mean, this is really smart marketing. Again, pharmacy, physicians, health care in general, and I think we are starting to realize that the doctor doesn’t always know the perfect way to get the message across. We’re there to do what we need to do, but certainly, this is really critical. Well, gentlemen, I think we have reached our point of closure. I appreciate your expertise and your time today. And as we wrap up, I want to thank you. I want to thank our viewing audience. We hope you found this Pharmacy Times® Peer Exchange to be very rich and informative, and until next time, take care of yourselves.Transcript edited for clarity.

Read part II here.In August 1997, the members of the village council of a small settlement in Alaska, called Brevig Mission, were faced with a peculiar request. A man named Johan Hultin wanted their permission to exhume a nearly 80-year-old mass grave. He claimed that he had done it before, 46 years earlier, and that he was back because his previous mission had failed.The council gave him its blessing when its members heard what he was after. According to him, hidden beneath the frozen ground lay preserved the recipe to make the deadliest virus humankind had ever encountered. No learning from the Spanish fluA virus from scratchScientists routinely engineer new viruses in the laboratory. They make changes to the genetic material (DNA or RNA) of existing viruses to create new variants that may or may not exist naturally. Doing so allows scientists to compare the properties of the edited variants to their natural counterparts and infer the role of the changes that they made.For example, if they observe that some patients have a higher viral load in their blood for a given disease, and a particular mutation is observed in the DNA of viruses isolated from those patients, they can introduce that mutation into the DNA of viruses that don’t naturally harbour it, to see if it improves the viral output in the laboratory.But while scientists can easily introduce changes to the genetic material of a virus, they can’t create a virus from scratch. They have to rely on nature to do this.So, scientists take samples from patients, make more copies of the genetic material using a technique called a polymerase chain reaction, and use it to understand the sequence of bases that makeup its genetic material. Once they have the sequence, they can tweak it.Meet H and NIn 1995, molecular pathologist Jeffery Taubenberger, who was working on the influenza virus, was trying to understand why some strains of the virus caused pandemics while others didn’t. Taubenberger realised that in order to do that, he needed to know the genetic makeup of the deadliest strain of influenza that had ever infected humans: the virus responsible for the 1918 disaster.At the time, 105 years ago today, the virus was estimated to have infected 500 million people – a third of the worlds’ population then. It was notorious for its ability to cause severe disease in people aged 15-34. It has been estimated that 50 million people died as a result. (To compare, the COVID-19 pandemic is thought to have caused around 6.9 million deaths.) 100 years of InfluenzaResearchers designate influenza strains using the types of two genes that the virus contains, named haemagglutinin and neuraminidase, designated ‘H’ and ‘N’. There are 18 subtypes of haemagglutinin, labelled H1-H18, and 11 types of neuraminidase, N1-N11, in nature. An influenza virus contains one of each and is classified accordingly.For example, the 1918 flu was caused by the H1N1 variant; the 1957 Asian flu was caused by H2N2; and the 1968 Hong Kong flu was caused by H3N2. There exist further sub-variations of these primary classifications, where different mutations exist in the ‘H’ and ‘N’ genes and which can further modify a virus’s properties. The 1918 flu and the 2009 swine flu were both caused by H1N1 – but they varied in disease severity due to the presence of changes on the H1 and N1 genes.Taubenberger wanted the 1918 version of H1N1. But there was a problem. The virus had vanished after 1920, when the pandemic ended. While there were subsequent influenza outbreaks later in 1957, 1968, and 1977, those viruses were different and nowhere near as deadly as the 1918 strain. Taubenberger was adamant to use the worst of all influenza variants in his studies because studying that strain was imperative, he believed, to understanding influenza.A letter from Johan HultinWith great difficulty, he obtained the preserved lung samples of a soldier who had died of the disease in 1918, and extracted a small portion of the genetic material of the virus. However, because he was running out of starting material, Taubenberger couldn’t generate the complete RNA sequence. So, together with another scientist named Ann Reid, he ended up publishing a small part of the sequence in March 1997.A few months later, Taubenberger received a letter from a doctor named Johan Hultin, who had read his article, and offered a solution to his small sample problem. Dr. Hultin claimed that in a small ocean-side village in Alaska, called Brevig Mission, there existed a mass grave in which 72 people who had all died due to the Great Influenza epidemic in 1918 had been buried. The Alaskan permafrost would have ensured the bodies were preserved almost perfectly – along with the virus.Dr. Hultin continued that he had visited the site in 1951 and had brought a few samples back. But due to the long return journey, the samples began to thaw, and he had to refreeze them with carbon dioxide from a fire extinguisher. But despite his best efforts, he couldn’t protect them, and the multiple freeze-thaw cycles destroyed the samples.Over a telephone call, Dr. Hultin offered to go back to Brevig Mission to retrieve more samples at his own expense. Taubenberger agreed. Analysis| How pandemics have changed the worldFull genetic sequenceAnd so, in August 1997, Johan Hultin, at the age of 72, went back to Brevig Mission to finish what he set out to do as a young graduate student 46 years earlier – to get the deadly 1918 H1N1 influenza virus. The task ahead of him was fraught with the risk of him contracting the deadly virus, and almost certain death after. But neither that nor the lack of specialised equipment proved to be a deterrent for Dr. Hultin. He went ahead with his mission just the same.The samples he brought back allowed Taubenberger and Reid to determine the virus’s full genetic sequence. The sequence allowed other scientists to unearth insights into the virus’s beginnings. It appeared to have an ancestor that was avian in origin. But there were also tell-tale signs that the virus had adapted, by evolving, to infect mammals.In other words, the ancestral virus that infected birds had switched to infecting humans or swine. It had also been circulating for a few years, getting better at its job, before it vanished. Sometime later, it reemerged as one of the deadliest pathogens ever to afflict humankind.But for all these remarkable insights, the virus’s genetic sequence revealed nothing dramatic about the virus itself. It failed to explain how it could infect people so quickly or why it killed millions. There were minor variations in the genetic material but this is to be expected for RNA viruses. There remained but one way to answer that question: to recreate the virus itself.Read part II here.Arun Panchapakesan is an assistant professor at the Y.R.

Crohn's DiseaseTaking Control of Crohn’sShare this articleShareShare on FacebookShare on XShare on PinterestCopy LinkWhat to Know About Colds and Flu if You Have Crohn’sPeople with inflammatory bowel disease are more likely to get sickened by certain viruses and bacteria than other people. Here’s how to protect your health.ByColleen de BellefondsMedically ReviewedbyIra Daniel Breite, MDUpdated on August 15, 2023People who have Crohn's disease should get the flu shot every year.Anna Drozdova /iStockIf you have Crohn’s disease, your doctor has probably told you to get the flu shot. There’s good reason for that. People with Crohn’s are more susceptible than the general population to infections such as the flu and more likely to experience complications that require hospitalization, such as pneumonia, whether or not they’re on immunosuppressant drugs.Kiara Horwitz, 34, a publicist in New York City, knows this firsthand. She’s never taken immunosuppressant drugs to treat her Crohn’s, but she still caught the flu in summer 2019, and it triggered a flare-up. “I landed in the ER,” she says. “My doctor put me on steroids until [I recovered].”Horwitz says that even the common cold sends her to bed for days and causes her symptoms to flare. “I think this is linked to anxiety about being sick,” she says. “Whenever I have high anxiety or stress, which can also lead to a cold or flu, it can affect my stomach.”While everyone gets sick from time to time, there are ways you can reduce the severity of your illnesses and keep your Crohn’s symptoms in check. Here’s what you need to know about colds and the flu if you have Crohn’s.1. You May Be More Likely to Get the Flu — Even If You’re Not on ImmunosuppressantsIt’s true that immunosuppressant medications — which are commonly prescribed for people with Crohn’s and work by suppressing the immune system to help treat inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract — can make people with Crohn’s more susceptible to the common cold and flu.But, something about Crohn’s disease itself may also predispose you to catching a cold or the flu. One study suggests that a gene mutation associated with Crohn’s disease causes faulty cell autophagy — the cleaning up of damaged cells, bacteria, and viruses — which makes it harder for the body to fight off infections.Taha Qazi, MD, a gastroenterologist and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) specialist at Cleveland Clinic, points to a study published in the journal Inflammatory Bowel Diseases that examined more than 140,000 people’s medical records and found that people with IBD were more likely to contract the flu than those without IBD, regardless of whether they were taking corticosteroids.“Crohn’s disease is an autoimmune condition that can lead to higher susceptibility to infections, even if [you aren’t] on any medications,” says Alyssa Parian, MD, a gastroenterologist who specializes in IBD at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. “[This could be] due to alterations in the immune system, which has a decreased ability to fight off bacteria and viruses.”TippiTV: An Inspiring New Series for People Living With Crohn’sA team of experts comes together to help three people with Crohn’s disease live their best lives.Watch now2. You May Need More Time to Recover — and Have More ComplicationsPeople with Crohn’s may not only be more susceptible to catching infections but also take longer to recover and be at greater risk of severe sickness and hospitalization.Additionally, Crohn’s may predispose you to certain complications. According to a study published in February 2021 in the journal Gastroenterology Research, the storm of inflammatory cytokines (substances secreted by immune cells) that are a characteristic of IBD can also trigger acute respiratory distress syndrome (a buildup of fluid in the lungs).A study in the American Journal of Gastroenterology also found that people with Crohn’s disease were at significantly higher risk than the general population of pneumonia, a common flu complication that can lead to hospitalization. Dr. Qazi attributes this to the use of immunosuppressive medications, such as corticosteroids. Another study, published in 2022, found that taking anti–tumor necrosis factor medications and prednisone was associated with higher risks of pneumonia and hospitalization.“At least anecdotally, it seems my IBD patients take a couple more weeks to recover than patients without IBD,” says Qazi.3. You Need to Get the Flu Shot Every Year, Not the Nasal Flu VaccineThe most important way to prevent flu complications is to get the flu vaccine every year, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends specifically for people who take corticosteroids or other immune-suppressing drugs.But, that doesn’t mean everyone is following their doctor’s orders: In a study published in 2019 in The American Journal of Gastroenterology, the rate of flu vaccination among people with Crohn’s was about 25 percent. “I battle with patients routinely about vaccine status,” says Qazi.“The flu shot not only decreases the risk of contracting the flu, but if you do get the flu, it decreases the severity of the flu,” says Dr. Parian. He adds that because Crohn’s also puts you at greater risk of a secondary bacterial pneumonia infection, it’s important to get the pneumonia vaccine also.That said, if you’re on immunosuppressant drugs for IBD, you should never get a live vaccine, such as the nasal flu vaccine — which contains a modified live flu virus — because it can be more dangerous to people who have a weakened immune system. Instead, get the flu shot, which contains the inactive (killed) virus.A few other simple, everyday actions can help you steer clear of germs that can make you sick:Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before preparing or eating food and after using the toilet. If you don’t have access to soap and water, use a hand sanitizer that’s at least 60 percent alcohol.Try to avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, which is how many people are exposed to germs.As much as possible, try to avoid close contact with people who are sick.In addition to getting the flu shot, Horwitz credits weekly acupuncture, a healthy diet, and workouts five days a week with helping keep her immune system strong.4. If You Do Catch the Flu, You Should See Your Doctor (and Possibly Start Antivirals) ImmediatelyThink you have the flu? Check in with your doctor right away to get tested and, if necessary, begin treatment. Antiviral medications for the flu are really only effective if started within 48 hours of the first symptoms, according to the CDC.“It’s important to catch it as soon as possible to prevent problems from escalating,” says Qazi.Symptoms of the flu include:FeverCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseBody achesHeadacheChills and fatigueVomiting and diarrhea (sometimes — more common in children than adults)Antiviral medications keep the flu virus from replicating, which helps shorten the time you’re sick and prevent serious complications. Be sure to take the full course your doctor prescribes.To protect others, stay home until your fever has been gone for at least 24 hours, and cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.5. You May Not Need to Stop Taking Your Crohn’s MedicationsYou should always talk to your doctor about your treatment plan, but Qazi says people with IBD usually don’t need to stop taking their meds if they catch the flu. “There’s a reason you’re on medication therapy,” he says. “When you get off, it can make the disease course worse.”But, your doctor’s recommendations may vary. “Depending on how severe [the flu and your Crohn’s are], your doctor might recommend holding your medications,” adds Parian.6. It’s Crucial to Stay HydratedIf you get sick, it’s more important than ever to drink plenty of liquids. Fever commonly associated with the flu increases the risk of dehydration, which is compounded by Crohn’s symptoms such as diarrhea.Keep an eye on the color of your urine, which should be clear or pale yellow. If it’s the color of dark straw or amber, you’re probably dehydrated. Because the amount of water every person needs varies, talk to your doctor if you’re concerned you’re not getting enough. “If you feel dehydrated or light-headed despite drinking fluids, you should call your doctor immediately,” says Parian.Keep in mind, water isn’t the only way to stay hydrated: A warm cup of chicken noodle soup feels comforting when you’re sick and counts as a liquid.In addition to staying hydrated, eat as healthy as possible, rest, and follow up closely with your primary care doctor.7. You Might Experience a Crohn’s FlareAn infection like the flu can sometimes trigger a Crohn’s flare, and certain flu medications can lead to diarrhea. That’s why it’s so important to keep in touch with your GI doctor to help you manage your GI symptoms if you’re sick.“It’s not uncommon for many infections, including the flu, to have GI symptoms, such as nausea and diarrhea, that are not related to the underlying Crohn’s at all,” says Parian. “Your doctor may want to order some additional testing to determine if it’s a Crohn’s flare or not.”Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkIra Daniel Breite, MDMedical ReviewerIra Daniel Breite, MD, is a board-certified internist and gastroenterologist.

Director General of the Medicines and Substances Department of Food and Drug Organization of Iran Mohammad Peyanpour said that the country has left successfully behind the hottest days of the summer without facing drug-related problems. "We have left behind summer without a shortage of serum, while in July and August 1401 (2022), we were facing a shortage," he said. Peykanpour also pointed out the necessary preparation of the influenza vaccine this year, saying that, "Before the beginning of autumn, we have been able to distribute the influenza vaccines through import and domestic production." He added, "Although we are far from ideal conditions in the field of medicine, the situation is acceptable compared to last year and the shortages we faced then."
