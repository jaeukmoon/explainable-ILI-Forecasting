CDC reported that year's first U.S. human infection with an influenza (flu) virus that normally spreads in pigs and not people. CDC recommends that people in contact with pigs take precautions and provides specific guidance for people who are at higher risk of developing serious complications from flu. CDC Update April 5, 2024 — On March 29, 2024, CDC reported this year's first U.S. human infection with an influenza (flu) virus that normally spreads in pigs and not people. The infection with an influenza A(H1N2) variant (v) virus occurred in a child living near a pig farm in Pennsylvania who had direct contact with pigs prior to illness onset. The person was hospitalized and has since recovered from their illness. CDC recommends that people in contact with pigs take precautions and provides specific guidance for people who are at higher risk of developing serious complications from flu. The patient sought health care during the week ending March 9, 2024, and had the following symptoms: fever, vomiting, cough, and rhinorrhea (runny nose). The hospitalized patient received influenza antiviral treatment and recovered. The case was first reported by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Local public health officials found that the patient had swine contact prior to illness onset. No person-to-person spread of the A(H1N2)v virus associated with this patient has been identified. Additional investigation determined that two of the patient's close contacts had also contact with swine and had been ill before the patient developed symptoms. The two persons had mild illness; their symptoms resolved, and they were not tested for influenza. Variant influenza virus infections usually cause mild illness; however, they can cause severe illness and are concerning because of their pandemic potential. Similar to seasonal flu, people with certain underlying conditions are at higher risk of developing serious complications from infections with swine-origin influenza viruses. First case of A(H1N2)v virus in the US in 2024 Every year, there are rare sporadic human infections with flu viruses that usually circulate in pigs. The first such infection with each novel influenza virus each year triggers international notification to global health authorities through International Health Regulations. When a virus that normally spreads in pigs is found in people, these are called "variant flu virus" infections and are designated with the letter "v" after the subtype. Variant influenza A virus infections are novel influenza A virus infections. A novel influenza A virus is an influenza A virus that is different from seasonal influenza A viruses spreading among people. Most human infections with variant influenza viruses occur following exposure to swine, but human-to-human spread can occur. However, in most cases, variant influenza viruses have not shown the ability to spread easily and sustainably from person to person. Variant influenza virus infections are usually associated with contact with pigs, often at agricultural fairs. These infections are fully investigated to ensure that such viruses are not spreading efficiently in people and to limit further exposure of people to infected animals if infected animals are identified. How Variant infections occur Human infections with variant influenza viruses happen mainly when an infected pig coughs or sneezes, and droplets containing influenza virus spread through the air. If these droplets land in your nose or mouth or are inhaled, you can be infected. There is also some evidence that you might get infected by touching something that has a virus on it and then touching your own eyes, mouth, or nose. CDC has information about how variant virus infections happen. The number of variant virus infections in the United States has ranged from a high of 321 during 2011-2012 to a low of one during 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. CDC Recommendations and Guidance Besides recommendations for people in contact with pigs or people who are at higher risk of serious flu complications, as well as recommendations for fair exhibitors, CDC has web resources and background to understand swine flu infections better. CDC also has information on prevention and treatment for people with exposure to pigs.

Since the disease was first detected in Michigan in 2022, this is the fourth detection of HPAI in a commercial facility, and the first detection in Ionia County. As wild birds complete their spring migration, it is crucial for every producer to protect their animals from wild birds and the germs they could be carrying. "As the weather remains cool and wild birds continue their migration, conditions are ideal for the virus to thrive and spread. While these conditions persist, the need to take preventative measures will be high," said State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland, DVM, MS, DACVPM. "Keeping HPAI out of Michigan s domestic animals remains a team effort, and it must be a top priority for all." HPAI is a highly contagious virus that can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. To protect other facilities in Michigan, the premises is currently under quarantine, and the birds will be depopulated to prevent disease spread. These efforts also help to ensure the safety and integrity of the commercial food supply. "Michigan's egg farmers are among the most proactive in the country, with their diligence leading to rapid detection of HPAI in this flock," said Dr. Nancy Barr, executive director of Michigan Allied Poultry Industries. "Strict biosecurity measures are in place to protect flocks from the increased threat of HPAI." According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the public health risk associated with avian influenza remains low. Also, no animals or products infected with HPAI will enter the commercial food chain. As a reminder, people should properly handle and cook all food. Whether it's a few backyard birds or a large commercial flock, following a few key steps is fundamental to protect the health and vitality of Michigan s domestic birds: Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed. Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops. Disinfect boots and other gear when moving between coops. Do not share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms. Clean and disinfect equipment and other supplies between If it cannot be disinfected, discard it. Use well or municipal water as drinking water for birds. Keep poultry feed secure to ensure there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents. MDARD is continuing to work diligently with local, state, and federal partners to quickly respond to reports of HPAI to best mitigate the spread of the disease and provide outreach. Reporting Possible Cases For Domestic Birds Domestic bird owners and caretakers should watch for multiple sudden deaths in the flock, a drop in egg production, a significant decrease in water consumption, diarrhea, sneezing/coughing, or an increase in sick birds. If avian influenza is suspected in domestic birds, contact MDARD immediately at 800-292-3939 (daytime) or 517-373-0440 (after- hours). For Wild Birds If anyone notices what appears to be unusual or unexplained deaths among wild bird populations, please report these cases to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) by: Using the DNR's Eyes in the Field app. Choose the Diseased Wildlife option among the selections for Observation Forms. Calling the DNR Wildlife Disease Laboratory at 517-336-5030. Stay Up to Date Subscribe to receive email notifications by visiting MDARD's website and clicking on the Avian Influenza link.

Search Inicio » News » High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza in Cattle Statements High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza in Cattle Published on 5 April 2024 Share: The page link has been copied to your clipboard View more Updated on 8 May 2024 The ongoing spread of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) in different regions of the world, alongside the recent detections of cases in cattle, is raising concerns within the international community.While HPAI primarily affects poultry and wild birds, avian influenza can occasionally be transmitted to mammals, including humans. In the last two years, an increasing number of H5N1 avian influenza cases are being reported in terrestrial and aquatic mammalians animals.The recently reported detections of HPAI in dairy cattle in the United States of America, have raised international concerns. Infected cattle may be asymptomatic or with mild illness showing non-specific clinical signs such as decreased milk production, thicker-colostrum‐like milk, reduced appetite, lethargy, fever and dehydration. These infections in cattle could indicate an increased risk of H5N1 viruses becoming better adapted to mammals, and potentially spilling over to humans and other livestock. Initial investigations so far have revealed that raw milk from infected cows is a high-risk material. Thus, only milk produced by healthy cows should be commercialised. There are evidence of horizontal virus transmission from infected lactating cows to other animals including cows, cats and poultry. No specific adaptation of the virus to either humans or mammals was identified. Several studies are being carried out to further explore the pathogenesis and transmission routes of these viruses, including among cattle and from cattle to other animals. In collaboration with its Reference Centres, our networks of experts and Members, the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) is closely monitoring the situation to assess the risks to animals, but also to humans, which is currently considered low. Timely and transparent reporting is crucial to maintain a good understanding of the disease situation and prevent any type of misinformation or disinformation. WOAH reminds its 183 Members that, based on the information currently available, restrictions to the international trade of healthy cattle and their products are not recommended unless justified by an import risk analysis conducted according to the WOAH Terrestrial Animal Health Code Chapter 2.1. WOAH calls on its Members to: Maintain enhanced avian influenza SURVEILLANCE in domestic and wild birds. INCLUDE HPAI as a differential diagnosis, in non-avian species, including cattle and other livestock populations, with high risk of exposure to HPAI viruses, in particular: Animals showing clinical signs compatible with avian influenza; Sick or dead domestic animals near affected premises; Suspected, including apparently healthy animals, that have been exposed to or epidemiologically linked to suspected or confirmed HPAI in birds or cattle (i.e. situated in HPAI high-risk areas or in areas where avian influenza has been confirmed). REPORT cases of HPAI in all animal species, including unusual hosts, to WOAH through its World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS). Genetic sequences of avian influenza viruses should be shared in publicly available databases. CONSIDER poultry vaccination as complementary avian influenza control measure; PREVENT the introduction and spread of the disease by implementing strict biosecurity measures in livestock holdings, in particular in milking parlour and EMPLOY good production and hygiene practices when handling animal products. Raw milk or raw milk products from HPAI infected cows or exposed to those infected with HPAI should not be used to feed animals or for human consumption. PROTECT humans in close contact with or handling sick cattle or other sick livestock and their products. Exposed humans should always take precautionary measures to avoid getting infected and minimize the risk to mechanically carry the virus that could infect livestock or companion animals. This should include wearing personal protective equipment, avoiding visiting other livestock premises after the exposure and implementing standard food safety measures when handling animal products from exposed livestock. AVOID implementing unjustified trade restrictions. Import risk management measures should be scientifically justified and in line with the WOAH International Standards. Technical guidelines for the adaptation of diagnostic tests for Influenza A in animals including cattle and other species as well as different types of samples such as milk and nasal swabs are available in the OFFLU website and will be regularly updated. WOAH is fully committed to supporting its Members to mitigate the risks associated with avian influenza.

A person in Texas became ill with bird flu after contact with infected dairy cattle, state officials reported Monday. It’s the first human case of the highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in Texas, and it’s the second recorded in the U.S., according to the health alert state officials issued. “The risk to the general public is believed to be low; however, people with close contact with affected animals suspected of having avian influenza A(H5N1) have a higher risk of infection,” the alert said. The patient’s primary symptom was conjunctivitis, or eye redness, according to the alert. State officials recommend that clinicians should “consider the possibility” of infection in people who have symptoms and a potential risk for exposure, including those who have had close contact with someone infected, contact with affected animals, or contact with unpasteurized milk from dairy farms with infections. Symptoms can include a fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, fatigue, eye redness, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or seizures. The illness can range from mild to severe, and health care providers who come across someone who may have the virus should “immediately consult their local health department,” according to the alert. Because eye redness has been observed in these infections before, health care providers like optometrists and ophthalmologists “should be aware of the potential of individuals presenting with conjunctivitis who have had exposure to affected animals,” according to the alert. The strain, novel avian influenza A(H5N1), started infecting dairy cattle in the Panhandle last week, in another blow to the Texas cattle industry after thousands were lost in historic Texas wildfires. Similar outbreaks were reported at dairies in Kansas and New Mexico. Lauren Ancel Meyers, professor and director of the Center for Pandemic Decision Science at the University of Texas at Austin, said there is a lot of uncertainty at this point. "On the positive side, it seems like this was a very mild case and it's the only case that's been identified so far," Meyers said. "But at the same time, it seems like there's quite a bit of this virus that has been detected in cattle populations. Anytime a virus jumps into a new species, especially a rapidly evolving virus like influenza — we need to be approaching it with the utmost caution and vigilance to make sure we really understand the situation." The U.S. Department of Agriculture said there is no safety concern to the commercial milk supply. Consumer health is also not at risk, the department said. The milk from impacted animals is being dumped or destroyed and will not enter the food supply.

(Nasdaq: CVAC) (“CureVac”), a global biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of transformative medicines based on messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”), today announced interim data from an ongoing Phase 2 part of the combined Phase 1/2 study of its seasonal influenza vaccine candidate, conducted in collaboration with GSK. The multivalent candidate was selected from a comprehensive Phase 1 part, which tested vaccine candidates with up to eight separate mRNA constructs per candidate. It was designed for broad antigen coverage, encoding antigens matched to all four WHO-recommended flu strains. Results from the planned interim analysis showed that the multivalent vaccine candidate using CureVac’s proprietary second-generation mRNA backbone boosted antibody titers against all encoded flu strains and across all age groups and tested dose levels, including the lowest tested dose. The vaccine candidate was shown to have an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, with the majority of solicited adverse events reported as either grade 1 (mild) or grade 2 (moderate) within seven days of dosing. The results confirm previous findings that the platform elicits strong overall antibody titers at well-tolerated dose levels. Among younger and older adults, geometric mean titers generated by the vaccine candidate against influenza A strains numerically exceeded the geometric mean titers of the licensed comparator vaccines consistently across all tested dose levels. For influenza B strains geometric mean titers were lower than those elicited by the licensed comparator vaccines across both age groups and tested dose levels. Targeted optimizations to further improve immune responses against influenza B strains will be tested in an additional Phase 2 study. “The Phase 2 interim data show that CureVac’s highly effective and flexible mRNA technology platform puts us on the right track to advance our joint seasonal influenza vaccine program,” said Dr. Myriam Mendila, Chief Development Officer of CureVac. “Results regarding influenza A strains were strong. Immunogenicity for B strains was in line with our expectations also in view of other initial mRNA-based clinical flu development programs. We are confident that planned optimizations will improve performance against these historically challenging influenza strains.” The Phase 2 dose-confirmation study assesses the reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity of different dose levels of a modified, multivalent vaccine candidate, encoding antigens matched to all four WHO-recommended flu strains. Reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity were assessed in 480 healthy younger adults aged 18 to 64 and 480 healthy older adults aged 65 to 85. In each age group, three different dose levels were tested in comparison to an age-appropriate, licensed comparator vaccine. For younger adults, immune responses were compared to a standard dose seasonal vaccine. For older adults, immune responses were compared to a high dose seasonal flu vaccine.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) discussed vaccinations for COVID-19, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), pneumococcal infections, and other infectious diseases and made some related recommendations during their first 2024 meeting, held February 28 to 29. COVID-19 Vaccine Recommendations The ACIP now recommends that persons 65 years of age and older should receive an additional dose of the updated (2023-2024) COVID-19 vaccine.1 The additional dose must be administered at least 4 months following the previous dose of the updated vaccine. Adults aged 65 years and older have expressed a high level of concern about COVID-19, with 68.4% of individuals indicating they would definitely receive another vaccine dose should it become available.2 The effectiveness of an additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine is demonstrated by past recommendations. The need for the recommended 4-month COVID-19 booster vaccine for those age 65 and older is supported by both hospitalization data and scientific reasoning. An estimated 67% of COVID-19 hospitalizations were among patients age 65 years and older between October 2023 and January 2024, according to ACIP current respiratory season calculations made using data from COVID-NET, a population-based hospitalization surveillance program.3 Moreover, hospitalizations were 5 times higher for those age 65 years and older vs those aged 50 to 64 years. The need for booster protection is also indicated by data showing that older adults may not be able to generate robust, long-lasting neutralizing antibody responses or good memory cytotoxic T-cells as there are fewer naive T-cells that respond to new pathogens.2 Vaccine formulations for the next COVID-19 season are already underway.2 Notably, members of the ACIP expressed concern that offering booster vaccinations for those age 65 and older at 4-month intervals could create vaccine fatigue as well as confusion for providers, given that immunocompromised patients may receive a booster dose following a 2-month interval. In their June 2024 meeting, the ACIP plans to propose revised time frames for COVID-19 vaccine development and vaccination that will allow health care providers ample time to prepare for the COVID-19 viral season. “The need for the recommended 4-month COVID-19 booster vaccine for those age 65 and older is supported by both hospitalization data and scientific reasoning. RSV Vaccine Developments An ACIP work group on RSV vaccination in older adults presented its recommendation that providers and patients “consider timing of the RSV vaccination as part of shared clinical decision-making discussions,” noting that for most older adults, RSV vaccination is most beneficial when received in late summer or early fall, before the start of RSV season.4 Although shared decision-making between patient and provider is currently recommended for determining whether or not an adult patient should receive the RSV vaccine, this recommendation may be replaced by a universal recommendation that adults above a certain age receive the RSV vaccine, and a risk-based recommendation that adults over age 50 years receive the vaccine, according to the work group report, “RSV Vaccination in Older Adults: Work Group Interpretations.”4 The ACIP also expressed its intention to discuss the potential approval of the GSK RSV vaccine, AREXVY, for those aged 50 to 59 at “increased risk of RSV disease” at their June meeting. AREXVY is currently approved for use in adults aged 60 and above.4 In anticipation of RSV-related actions set for June, the ACIP reviewed RSV vaccine data related to the Moderna mRNA vaccine.4,5 The committee also discussed concerns over the potential connection between currently approved RSV vaccines and an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). Moderna mRNA RSV Vaccine Moderna has been conducting a clinical trial for their mRNA-based RSV vaccine for adults age 60 years and older (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05127434), which works by encoding the RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein.5 According to an ACIP report on trial findings that was presented at the February meeting, the vaccine has been generally well tolerated, efficacious through a median 8.6 months of follow-up, and presented no safety concerns (including no concern over GBS). The trial enrolled a total of 26,550 healthy adults age 60 years and older, including those with chronic, stable health conditions. The primary endpoint was vaccine efficacy in preventing the first episode of RSV lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) between 14 days and 12 months post-vaccination. The secondary endpoint was vaccine efficacy in preventing the first episode of RSV acute respiratory disease (ARD) and first hospitalization between 14 days and 12 months. Trial investigators found that vaccine efficacy for RSV-LRTD with 2 or more symptoms reached 83.7%, whereas efficacy for RSV-LRTD with 3 or more symptoms was calculated as 82.4%.5 The efficacy threshold for RSV-ARD was set at 68.4%. Vaccine efficacy met lower bounds of confidence interval criteria to exceed 20%. RSV Vaccines and GBS For the February ACIP meeting, CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shared preliminary data from multiple surveillance systems on the risk for GBS after RSV vaccination.4 An elevated but rare risk for GBS was observed following administration of the GSK’s AREXY and Pfizer’s ABRYSVO vaccines for RSV. According to the work group report on RSV Vaccination in Older Adults, current surveillance data “support a potential increased risk for GBS after RSV vaccination among adults aged ≥60 years.”4 The report went on to note that “there is currently insufficient evidence to confirm whether RSV vaccination is associated with increased risk for GBS in older adults, or to estimate the magnitude of any increase in GBS risk after RSV vaccination.”4 Currently, clinical trials are underway evaluating the safety of these vaccines, examining the association between RSV vaccines and the incidence of GBS. More conclusive evidence of potential risks following RSV vaccination will be available following RSV monitoring using self-controlled case series designs. Influenza Immunization in Children With Asthma The ACIP also assessed evidence evaluating the safety of the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) in children with asthma.6 The evidence indicated that LAIV4 may be a suitable option for children age 5 years and older with asthma. Evidence presented included a study assessing whether LAIV4 is noninferior to IIV4. The study included 151 patients between the ages of 5 and 7 years with persistent asthma who were randomly assigned to 2 groups: one receiving LAIV4 FluMist and the other receiving IIV4 Fluzone. On days 15 and 43, the 2 groups were evaluated for symptoms following vaccination. The study investigators compared the proportion of patients using LAIV4 vs IIV4 who experienced an asthma exacerbation during the 42 days following vaccination. Study findings showed that in the 14 days following vaccination, 3 exacerbations were reported among those receiving LAIV4 vs 4 exacerbations among those receiving IIV4 (3.9% vs. 5.7%, P =.74). In the 42-day symptom assessment, 8 asthma exacerbations were documented among those receiving LAIV4 and 10 among those receiving IIV4 (10.8% vs. 14.7%, p = 0.74). The upper bound for noninferiority was set at 10% with a difference in proportion of 3.9 (CI: 90%: -0.15, 0.07).6 Researchers rejected the null hypothesis and proved LAIV4 noninferiority to IIV4. Limitations of the study include the enrollment of fewer participants than intended, setting the power at 79% and the enrollment of patients within 2 separate flu seasons, which may have led to slightly different products. Further discussion of the suitability of LAIV4 for children age 5 years and older with asthma is anticipated at future ACIP meetings. Pneumococcal Vaccination: PCV21 Considerations The ACIP also discussed incorporating a recently developed pneumococcal vaccine, V116, a 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV21), into its roster of recommended pneumococcal vaccines. Toward that end, the committee reviewed phase 3 clinical trial results for V116 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05425732). The ACIP reported that the following policy questions are being actively considered by its work group:7 Should PCV21 be recommended for US adults aged 19 and older who currently have a recommendation to receive a PCV? Should PCV21 be recommended for US adults aged 50 to 64 years who do not have risk-based indication for the pneumococcal vaccine? Should PCV21 be recommended for US adults aged 19 to 49 years who do not have risk-based indication for the pneumococcal vaccine? About 30% to 40% of adult invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases are caused by serotypes that are not contained in currently available pneumococcal vaccines.8 The PCV21 vaccine contains most of these serotypes and provides broader coverage. In a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled clinical study of the V116 PCV21 vaccine, V116 was concluded to be superior to PCV20 for 10 out of the 11 of its unique strains. The work group concluded that pneumococcal disease is of public health importance to adults currently recommended for PCV vaccination. While it may be appropriate to expand vaccination to patients between the ages of 50 to 64, committee members concluded that epidemiology does not support expanding vaccination to younger adults without indication. At its June meeting, the ACIP plans to consider official draft policies on PCV21 use in US adults.7 References: Feb 28, 2024 ACIP Meeting – Public comment & VFC votes. www.youtube.com.

While state-of-the-art SOSIP or single-chain Env designs can be expressed as native-like trimers, undesired monomers, dimers and malformed trimers that elicit non-neutralizing antibodies are also formed, implying that these designs could benefit from further modifications for gene-based vaccination approaches. Here, we describe the triple tandem trimer (TTT) design, in which three Env protomers are genetically linked in a single open reading frame and express as native-like trimers. Viral vectored Env TTT induced similar neutralization titers but with a higher proportion of trimer-specific responses. The TTT design was also applied to generate influenza hemagglutinin (HA) trimers without the need for trimerization domains. Additionally, we used TTT to generate well-folded chimeric Env and HA trimers that harbor protomers from three different strains. In summary, the TTT design is a useful platform for the design of HIV-1 Env and influenza HA immunogens for a multitude of vaccination strategies.

Such bNAbs develop in a subset of chronically infected patients and have been shown to be protective in titers achievable by vaccination7,8,9. Env is a class I fusion trimeric protein that engages CD4 and its CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor to mediate target cell fusion10,11,12,13,14. The env gene encodes a gp160 precursor polyprotein that is synthesized and initially trimerizes in the endoplasmic reticulum. N-linked glycosylation and furin cleavage of the gp160 protein into mature gp120 and gp41 subunits are essential for folding into its native prefusion conformation15,16. The Env complexes on the viral surface consist of three heterodimeric gp120-gp41 protomers. The membrane proximal external region (MPER) of gp41 is attached to the membrane by a coiled coil transmembrane domain that aids in trimerization of the complex. The gp120 subunits interact with gp41 by non-covalent interactions17,18, which can result in shedding of some of the gp120 and exposure of gp41 ‘decoys’ that participate in immune evasion19,20.The first-generation recombinant HIV-1 Env immunogens consisted of unstable complexes that expose non-neutralizing antibody (non-NAb) epitopes, which are normally not exposed on infectious viral Env4,21,22. These non-NAb epitopes are considered undesirable because they attract immunodominant responses and might distract the immune system from targeting the desired neutralizing antibody (NAb) epitopes. Furthermore, these non-native Env immunogens do not properly display several quaternary-dependent antibody epitopes23,24,25,26.It took several years of iterative design to generate soluble native-like Env immunogens, including SOSIP trimers27,28,29,30. SOSIP modifications include the truncation of gp41 at position 664, a disulfide bond (501C-605C) to covalently link the gp120 and gp41 subunits27, an Ile-to-Pro mutation (I559P) to prevent conformational transitions to the post-fusion state29 (a strategy that was also applied for many COVID-19 vaccines31), and an RRRRRR (R6) multibasic motif to enhance furin cleavage28,32. The determination of Env SOSIP trimer structures33,34 led to a plethora of further structure-based stabilizing mutations and novel Env trimer designs, such as single-chain (SC; also called native flexibly-linked, NFL), and uncleaved prefusion-optimized (UFO) Env trimers35,36,37. These SC and UFO trimers contain a flexible linker that connects the gp120 and gp41 subunits and allows a native-like conformation without the need of furin cleavage37,38. Several native-like Env trimers based on the SOSIP and SC designs are currently being tested in phase I clinical trials31,39.Gene-based vaccines, including viral-vectored and nucleic acid immunogens (e.g., mRNA and DNA), have recently gained momentum because of their simplicity, reduced development and manufacturing costs, and advances in delivery methods40,41,42,43. For instance, viral vectors and mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs)43 have been shown to efficiently elicit both NAb and cellular immune responses44,45. Furthermore, platforms such as self-amplifying RNAs46,47 and integrase-deficient lentivirus vectors (IDLVs)48,49, which allow for prolonged antigen exposure, may further enhance immune responses. Most recently, nucleic acid vaccines have gained particular importance in combatting the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic43,50, building an excellent safety record along the way.During the production of Env proteins for vaccination, cells transfected with state-of-the-art HIV-1 Env designs, such as SOSIP and SC, produce the desired native-like trimers, but also monomeric, dimeric and malformed trimeric species that expose undesired epitopes (Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, size exclusion and/or affinity chromatography purification methods are required to obtain homogeneous protein preparations containing only native-like trimeric species30,35,36. As selective purification is impractical during gene-based vaccination, these Env designs may not be optimal for nucleic acid vaccination approaches. One of the strategies to alleviate this problem is the use of heterologous trimerization-inducing domains, like the GCN4 leucine zipper51,52,53 or the bacteriophage T4 fibritin foldon54,55 motifs, which enhance trimerization of several class I fusion proteins, including HIV-1 Env23,56,57,58,59 and influenza hemagglutinin (HA)60,61,62. However, these heterologous domains can induce aberrant Env conformations63, and also immunodominant antibody responses that might hinder Env- or HA-targeting NAb responses59.A recombinant Env design that expresses mostly as native-like trimers would therefore be a great advance for unlocking the potential of genetic vaccination for induction of bNAbs against HIV-1. Here, we describe an Env design, named Triple Tandem Trimer (TTT), in which we genetically fused three Env protomers by flexible linkers. We generated Env TTT constructs that expressed only as trimers, the majority of which were native-like. Using viral vector-based vaccination, we found that TTT constructs induce less non-neutralizing responses than other recombinant Env trimer designs. We also applied the TTT design for generation of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and chimeric Env and HA constructs that express only as trimers and present native-like features.ResultsDesign and characterization of a native-like Env triple tandem trimer (TTT)Ideally, an HIV-1 Env construct intended for nucleic acid-based vaccination should only express trimers and should not require furin cleavage for native-like folding (Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, we conceived a triple tandem trimer (TTT) design, encompassing three successive gp140 protomers genetically linked in a single open reading frame (Fig. 1a, b). As proof of concept, we generated a BG505 SOSIP.v8.4 TTT construct. Each BG505 SOSIP.v8.4 (referred to as SOSIP.v8 herein) protomer includes all of the SOSIP.v4.1 mutations64, as well as additional modifications (MD39) that improve thermostability and trimerization65. The individual mutations are detailed in the “Methods” section and Supplementary Table 1. Moreover, the R6 furin cleavage site28 was replaced by a 15-residue flexible linker to assure furin independence (Fig. 1a, b), akin to previous uncleaved single-chain (SC) Env constructs35,36. Next, we linked the gp41 C-terminus of each protomer to the gp120 N-terminus of the neighboring protomer (Fig. 1a, b). The termini are separated by ~11 Å (Fig. 1b); therefore, we introduced a relatively long 11-residue flexible linker between the protomers to allow enough rotational freedom for trimer assembly. Additionally, this BG505 TTT construct contained a C-terminal StrepII-Tag for purification and immobilization purposes. To visualize how the linkers could be accommodated on the bottom of the trimer, we used AlphaFold2, which predicted that BG505 TTT could fold with a structure similar to the experimentally determined structure of a native-like BG505 Env trimer (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c), even without including PDB templates as input for the prediction (Supplementary Fig. 2d).Fig. 1: Design and biophysical characterization of a triple tandem trimer Env construct.a Linear representation of SOSIP, single-chain (SC) and triple tandem trimer (TTT) Env constructs. The SOSIP construct presents a R6 furin cleavage motif (black triangle) between gp120 and gp140 subunits, which is replaced by SC linkers (green lines) in SC and TTT constructs. The TTT construct is composed of three SC protomers fused by TTT linkers (purple discontinuous lines). N- and C-termini of each protomer are colored in yellow and red, respectively. b Expected position of TTT linkers on the structure of a BG505.SOSIP trimer (PDB 5CEZ).

Heatmap values correspond to the ratio between the areas under the curve (AUC) of each Ab and the one of 2G12, calculated using the binding curves in Supplementary Fig. 4c. f Crystal structure of 2G12-purified BG505 TTT (blue) in complex with PGT124 Fabs (dark pink) and 35O22 scFvs (dark yellow) at 5.8 Å resolution.Full size imageTo initially assess the expression and antigenicity of BG505 TTT, we performed a StrepTactinXT ELISA assay with unpurified supernatants from HEK293T cells transfected with the BG505 TTT construct, as well as BG505 SOSIP.664, SOSIP.v8, and single-chain SOSIP.v8 (herein termed SC) control constructs (Supplementary Fig. 3). The TTT supernatant interacted well with all tested bNAbs, including those targeting quaternary epitopes (PGT145, VRC26.25, and PGT15166,67,68,69), while showing weak binding to non-NAb F105.Next, we purified BG505 TTT from transiently transfected HEK293F suspension cells using StrepTactinXT affinity chromatography, an unbiased purification method that should capture all Env, not specifically native-like trimers. The TTT protein yields (~2.1 mg/L) were similar to those obtained from cells transfected with SC or SOSIP.v8, without or with furin co-expression (~2.8 mg/L, ~2.7 mg/L and ~3.4 mg/L, respectively) (Table 1). However, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and PAGE analyses showed that the BG505 TTT preparation consisted of covalently linked trimers exclusively, while SOSIP.v8 and SC controls also contained substantial amounts of dimers and monomers (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 4a). Negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) revealed that >85% of StrepTactinXT-purified TTT trimers displayed a native-like morphology, while StrepTactinXT-purified SC and SOSIP.v8 preparations contained substantial amounts of dimers and monomers (Fig. 1d, Table 1). We obtained high protein yields (~16 mg/L) and similar percentages of native-like trimers when we purified BG505 TTT using Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNL) chromatography (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 5).Table 1 Production yields and biophysical characterization of the different Env and HA proteinsFull size tableFurthermore, the BG505 TTT protein retained favorable antigenicity and engaged quaternary-dependent PGT145 and VRC26.25 bNAbs more efficiently than SOSIP.v8 controls, while the linkers in BG505 TTT did not disrupt binding of the gp120-gp41 interface-targeting PGT151 bNAb (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 4c). The predominance of native-like species also resulted in increased presentation of epitopes targeted by non-quaternary-dependent bNAbs VRC01 and PGT121 (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 4c). Nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) showed that TTT displayed a midpoint melting temperature (Tm) of 76.9 °C, slightly lower than one of the most stable BG505 SOSIP proteins described to date: BG505 SOSIP.v9.3 protein (80.7 °C)70 (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 4b). Glycosylation plays a major role in the folding, antigenicity and immunogenicity of HIV-1 Env71. To interrogate the glycan shield of BG505 TTT, we performed site-specific glycan analysis and compared the glycan abundance and species at each position to those from regular furin-cleaved BG505 SOSIP.v8. This analysis revealed that the glycan occupancy and processing of BG505 TTT was comparable with that of SOSIP trimers72, and that key glycan bNAb epitopes are conserved across both formats (Supplementary Fig. 4d, Supplementary Table 2).To further assess whether the TTT design allows native-like folding, we determined a crystal structure at 5.8 Å of 2G12-purified BG505 TTT in complex with PGT124 Fabs and 35O22 scFvs (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Table 3). We did not observe density for the SC and TTT linkers, probably due to their high flexibility. However, the overall conformation of BG505 TTT is similar to that of other native-like BG505 Env trimers. Furthermore, although the relatively low resolution precluded the assignment of side chains and their interactions, PGT124 and 35O22 bound BG505 TTT with similar angles of approach to those observed with other Env trimers73. Overall, these observations confirm that BG505 TTT folds with a conformation closely resembling those of other native-like Env trimers.BG505 TTT elicits qualitatively improved antibody responses in mice and rabbitsSimian (chimpanzee) adenovirus-derived ChAdOx174 and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)75 are well-established vector systems for the delivery of immunogens76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83. ChAdOx1 was used by AstraZeneca to deliver one of the first effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines50. MVA vaccines were used for smallpox eradication and are currently being used against the 2022 mpox outbreak79. Since BG505 TTT immunogens may be especially suitable for gene-based vaccination, including viral vector delivery, we generated ChAdOx1 and MVA vectors encoding either BG505 SOSIP.664 or TTT. Both ChAdOx1.TTT and MVA.TTT efficiently expressed as Env trimers in transduced HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. 6).To evaluate the immunogenicity of vector-delivered BG505 TTT, we vaccinated two groups of mice and four groups of rabbits at weeks 0, 4, and 8 or weeks 0, 8, 24, and 40, respectively (Fig. 2a, b). For both models, two groups of animals were primed with ChAdOx1- and MVA-delivered SOSIP.664 (group 1) or TTT constructs (group 2), and boosted with purified SOSIP.664 protein. These ChAdOx1, MVA and protein regimens are abbreviated as SOSIP.664 (C/M/P) and TTT (C/M/P), respectively. In parallel, group 3 rabbits were immunized with three doses of purified SOSIP.664 protein (SOSIP.664 (P/P/P)). Group 4 rabbits were co-immunized with viral-vectored TTT and SOSIP.664 protein at weeks 0 and 8, and were finally boosted with SOSIP.664 protein (TTT (CP/MP/P)). Sera were collected two weeks after each immunization to characterize the polyclonal antibody responses in mice (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 4) and rabbits (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary Tables 5, 6).Fig. 2: Immunogenicity of viral-vectored BG505 TTT.a, b Mice (a) and rabbits (b) immunization schedules. Two groups of BALB/c mice were immunized (black arrows) at weeks 0, 4, and 8, and antibody responses were evaluated (red arrows) at weeks 2, 6, and 10. Four groups of New Zealand White rabbits were immunized at weeks 0, 8, 24, and 40, and antibody responses were evaluated at weeks 10, 26, and 42. The tables show the detailed regimen for each of the groups. c, d Ratios between trimer (SOSIP.664 or SOSIP.v8)-binding and gp120-binding titers, measured in mice (c) and rabbits (d). Median values are represented by horizontal lines. Statistical differences between groups (c, d) were determined using a two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001).Full size imageTo determine the quality of the antibody response, we measured the binding of the sera to three different BG505 antigens (gp120, SOSIP.664 and SOSIP.v8) by D7324-capture ELISA (Supplementary Figs. 7a, 8a). The gp120 monomers more readily expose non-NAb epitopes than SOSIP.664 and SOSIP.v822,30,84,85. SOSIP.664 trimers still display the V3-loop in ELISA22,30, while SOSIP.v8 trimers show negligible V3-targeting Ab reactivity84,85 due to the presence of stabilizing mutations64,65. Therefore, a higher proportion of anti-trimer (SOSIP.664- and SOSIP.v8) binding is indicative of higher-quality Ab responses. Both in mice and rabbits, SOSIP.664 and TTT (groups 1 and 2) elicited similar anti-trimeric binding titers (Supplementary Fig. 7a, 8a). However, SOSIP.664 elicited stronger anti-gp120 responses than TTT, consistent with undesired species participating in the SOSIP.664-induced immune response. Additionally, TTT-primed animals (group 2) elicited higher titers against the more stabilized SOSIP.v8 trimers than those primed with SOSIP.664 (group 1), especially after the SOSIP.664 protein boost. In rabbits, priming with viral vector and protein co-immunization (group 4) induced the highest and most consistent binding titers to all three antigens (Supplementary Fig. 8a).Next, we calculated the ratios between the binding titers to each trimeric protein (SOSIP.664 or SOSIP.v8) and gp120 monomer (Fig. 2c, d). At week 10, the SOSIP.664:gp120 and SOSIP.v8:gp120 ratios were ~33-fold (p < 0.0001) and ~574-fold (p < 0.0001) higher, respectively, for TTT-primed (group 2) than for SOSIP.664-primed (group 1) mice (Fig. 2c). In rabbits, week 26 ratios were ~3.5-fold (p < 0.0001, SOSIP.664:gp120) and ~20-fold (p < 0.0001, SOSIP.v8:gp120) higher for group 2 than for group 1 (Fig. 2d). This confirms that priming with TTT, which expresses less undesired monomeric and dimeric species, steers responses away from gp120-specific non-NAb epitopes and towards epitopes that are better presented on Env trimers.To determine whether the Gly-Ser TTT linkers represent a neo-epitope, we measured the binding of the sera from BG505 TTT and SOSIP immunized mice to a TTT linker-like peptide (Supplementary Fig. 9). None of the sera showed binding, indicating that TTT linkers are not immunogenic or, at least in the context of BG505 TTT, do not represent an immunodominant neo-epitope.Next, we measured the autologous NAb titers against a BG505/T332N pseudovirus in a standard Tzm-bl assay. None of the mice showed autologous NAb activity (Supplementary Fig. 7b), consistent with earlier reports that mice do not easily generate NAbs against BG505 trimers86. In rabbits, despite the higher trimer-specific binding responses, BG505 TTT elicited autologous NAb responses similar to those elicited by SOSIP.664 (Supplementary Fig. 8b). An explanation might be that the dominant autologous BG505 NAb epitopes are present on gp120 and BG505 gp120 can in some cases induce BG505 NAbs22. Furthermore, we did not detect cross-neutralizing responses in the two rabbits (37194 and 37212) that developed the highest autologous NAb titers at week 42 (Supplementary Fig. 8c).In summary, BG505 TTT efficiently elicits trimer-focused antibody responses in both mice and rabbits. In rabbits, the BG505 TTT-induced responses are able to neutralize the parental BG505 virus.Glycans effectively mask immunodominant epitopes on BG505 TTTBG505 env lacks conserved PNGS on positions 241 and 289, which creates a large immunodominant glycan hole that attracts unwanted strain-specific Ab responses87,88,89,90,91. Therefore, we generated a glycan hole masked (GM) BG505 TTT construct (TTT.GM) that includes potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) at positions 241 and 289 (Supplementary Fig. 10a). The introduction of these PNGS did not affect the overall properties of the TTT.GM construct, which expressed only as trimers with conformation, thermostability and antigenicity comparable to those of the original TTT (Supplementary Fig. 10b–f, Table 1). Site-specific glycan analysis revealed that the newly incorporated N241 and N289 sites in TTT.GM were efficiently populated by oligomannose-type glycans (Supplementary Fig. 10g, Supplementary Table 7), which explained the complete abrogation of the binding of a 241/289-targeting NAb (10A89) (Supplementary Fig. 10e).All soluble Env proteins, including BG505 TTT, present a base glycan hole that constitutes an immunodominant neo-epitope and attracts a high proportion of undesired non-NAb responses86,87,88. In the context of TTT.GM, we attempted to cover the trimer base with glycans by adding PNGS in the TTT linkers, but were so far unsuccessful as these sites were largely unoccupied (Supplementary Fig. 10g, Supplementary Table 7) and RM19B1 and RM20A292 base-targeting Abs were still reactive (Supplementary Fig. 10e). The presence of the SC and TTT linkers did, however, block the epitopes of two other base-targeting Abs (RM19R, RM20G92) (Supplementary Fig. 10e).To evaluate the influence of the 241/289 glycan masking strategy on the immunogenicity of TTT constructs, we immunized rabbits with BG505 TTT.GM following a CMP schedule (Supplementary Fig. 11a). We found no significant differences in binding responses and trimer-to-gp120 ratios between the TTT and TTT.GM groups (Supplementary Fig. 11b, c, Supplementary Table 5). However, none of the rabbits vaccinated with BG505 TTT.GM developed detectable NAb titers against the parental BG505 pseudovirus (Supplementary Fig. 11d, Supplementary Table 6), consistent with the efficient masking of the immunodominant 241/289 glycan hole.Thus, we demonstrate that the TTT design can be adapted to accommodate glycans that shield some of the undesired epitopes on soluble native-like Env trimers.The TTT design can be applied to influenza hemagglutininSince class I viral fusion glycoproteins share a similar architecture93, we hypothesized that some of them, other than Env, might be amenable for the TTT design. A structural screening revealed that the location of the N- and C-termini of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protomers is analogous to that of HIV-1 Env. Therefore, we generated a proof-of-concept HA TTT construct encoding three NL03 (A/Netherlands/213/2003(H3N2)) protomers connected by TTT flexible linkers and with a C-terminal StrepII-Tag. The distance between the N- and C-termini of neighboring HA protomers is ~23 Å (Fig. 3b), i.e., substantially longer than the ~11 Å for HIV-1 Env (Fig. 1b). Consequently, we designed a longer 22-residue TTT linker to connect the different HA protomers (Fig. 3a, b). As controls, we also generated the corresponding HA and HA fused to a GCN4 trimerization domain (HA GCN4) (Fig. 3a). The AlphaFold2 prediction of HA TTT showed how the linkers could be accommodated on the bottom of the trimer (Supplementary Fig. 12).Fig. 3: Design and biophysical characterization of a triple tandem trimer HA construct.a Linear representation of standard (HA), GCN4-trimerized (HA GCN4), and triple tandem trimer (HA TTT) HA constructs.

Dots and error bars represent the average and standard deviation of values obtained in two independent experiments.Full size imageThe three HA constructs were expressed in HEK293F suspension cells and purified by StrepTactinXT affinity chromatography. HA TTT showed somewhat lower purification yields than HA and HA GCN4 (~3.0 mg/L versus ~7.6 mg/L and ~6.5 mg/L, respectively) (Table 1). In SEC, both HA TTT and HA GCN4 eluted as a single peak at a volume consistent with the size of HA trimers, while HA eluted as a single peak at a higher volume, indicating the presence of non-trimeric HA forms (Supplementary Fig. 13a). The bands on SDS-PAGE confirmed that HA TTT consisted of three covalently linked HA protomers (Supplementary Fig. 13b). By nsEM, purified HA TTT and HA GCN4 appeared homogeneous and contained only trimers, while HA appeared as a heterogeneous mix of monomers, dimers and some trimers (Fig. 3c). However, the size and shape of HA trimers complicate the reliable quantification of monomers, dimers and trimers. We therefore complexed the three proteins with Fabs of the bNAb CR911494 (Fig. 3c), which binds a conserved conformational epitope on the HA stem. nsEM-generated 2D class averages of these complexes revealed that all HA TTT and HA GCN4 particles presented three Fabs bound, as expected for trimers, while most HA particles had a single Fab bound, indicating that monomers were the predominant species. A nsEM-generated 3D model confirmed that HA TTT-CR9114 complexes assume a conformation consistent with a previously determined high-resolution structure of a native-like H3 HA trimer in complex with CR9114 Fabs94 (Fig. 3d).To assess the antigenicity of HA TTT, we evaluated the binding of several bNAbs, including the head-specific C0595 and FluA-2096, and the stem-specific CR802097, CR911494, and FI6v398 (Fig. 3e). FI6v3 contacts a quaternary epitope located in the stem region between two neighboring protomers Thus, we considered that FI6v3 and CR9114 binding are appropriate proxies for proper folding and resistance to unwanted post-fusion conversion. While the binding of CR8020, C05 and FluA-20 was similar for the three proteins, FI6v3 and CR9114 showed stronger binding to HA TTT and HA GCN4 than to the HA protein (Fig. 3e). These findings suggest that HA TTT not only forms trimers, but also trimers that are folded in the proper conformation. The nanoDSF-determined Tm value of HA TTT (54.5 °C) was substantially higher than that of HA (49.0 °C), but lower than that of HA GCN4 (58.8 °C) (Supplementary Fig. 13c, Table 1). Furthermore, site-specific glycan analysis revealed that the glycosylation of HA TTT corresponds well with that of a native-like H3 HA trimer analyzed previously99,100 (Supplementary Fig. 13d, Supplementary Table 8).Overall, we show that the HA TTT format yields high quality and stable HA trimers, demonstrating the broad applicability of the TTT platform for the design of class I fusion proteins.The TTT platform allows for expression of chimeric Env immunogensThe production of chimeric immunogens containing three different protomers in a single Env trimer has been previously reported101. However, this study relied on complex protocols involving several sequential purification methods for their isolation. We hypothesized that the TTT design would facilitate the controlled generation and isolation of chimeric immunogens. As proof of concept, we generated a chimeric Env TTT (chEnv TTT) construct encoding single-chain BG505, ConM, and AMC011 protomers connected by 11-residue TTT flexible linkers (Fig. 4a, b). We used AlphaFold2 to generate a predicted structure of chEnv TTT sequence for visualization purposes (Supplementary Fig. 14).Fig. 4: Design and biophysical characterization of a chimeric Env TTT (chEnv TTT) construct.a Linear representation of the chEnv TTT construct, composed of single-chain BG505, ConM, and AMC011 protomers connected by TTT linkers (purple discontinuous lines).

PGT145-purified BG505 SOSIP.v5.2, ConM SOSIP.v7 and AMC011 SOSIP.v9 were included as homotrimeric controls. The experiment was performed in duplicate, and the curves shown correspond to one of these repetitions. e nsEM-generated 3D models of the chEnv TTT protein in complex with 43A2 and CM01A Fabs.Full size imageContrary to homotrimeric BG505 TTT, StreptactinXT-purified chEnv TTT contained substantial amounts of aggregates, malformed trimers, dimers and monomers, possibly due to lower compatibility between the protomers in the chEnv TTT protein (Supplementary Fig. 15). Therefore, we expressed chEnv TTT in HEK293F suspension cells and purified the resulting protein by PGT145 affinity chromatography, which selects only well-formed trimers, obtaining a yield of 0.4 mg/L (Table 1). The PGT145-purified protein preparation contained 89% of covalently linked native-like trimers and no monomers or dimers (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 16a), and presented a nanoDSF-measured Tm of 69.3 °C (Supplementary Fig. 16b, Table 1). This Tm is lower than for BG505 TTT (76.9 °C), but comparable to those previously reported for BG505 SOSIP.v4.2 (70.7 °C)102, ConM SOSIP.v7 (67.8 °C)73 and AMC011.v5.2 (67.0 °C)103. After using SEC to obtain a homogeneous trimer preparation depleted of aggregates (Supplementary Fig. 16c), a BLI assay was performed to assess the antigenicity of chEnv TTT (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 16d). The antibody panel included bNAbs (2G12, VRC01, PGT121, PGT145, VRC026.25, PG16, PGT151) and non-NAbs (F105 and 19b), but also BG505- (43A2)104 and ConM-specific (CM01A)105 antibodies. PGT145-purified BG505 SOSIP.v5.2, ConM SOSIP.v7, and AMC011 SOSIP.v9 trimers were included as homotrimeric controls. chEnv TTT was reactive to all bNAbs tested, and did not bind non-NAbs F105 and 19b. Except for PGT151, whose binding is affected by the presence of the SC and TTT linkers, and 2G12, which was used as a loading control, all bNAbs showed a binding signal that accounted for approximately the average of the binding signals observed for the three homotrimeric controls (Supplementary Fig. 16d), consistent with a well-folded chimeric protein. Furthermore, the 43A2 and CM01A showed reduced (approximately a third) binding to the chEnv TTT protein compared to the BG505 and ConM homotrimeric controls, respectively (Fig. 4d), indicating that only one of the protomers in chEnv TTT is reactive to these strain-specific antibodies, and thus validating its chimeric nature. nsEM-generated 3D models of the chEnv TTT in complex with 43A2 and CM01A Fabs confirmed that only one of the protomers of the chimeric protein was reactive to these strain-specific antibodies (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 16e). Site-specific glycan analysis of chEnv TTT revealed a glycosylation profile (Supplementary Fig. 16f, Supplementary Table 9) comparable to BG505 TTT (Supplementary Fig. 4d) and other native-like Env trimers.Fig. 5: Design and biophysical characterization of chimeric HA TTT constructs.a, e Linear representations of chimeric cH125 TTT (a) and cH125/111 TTT (e) constructs, and the corresponding monomeric and GCN4-trimerized controls. The cH125 TTT construct is composed of NL09 (A/Netherlands/602/2009(H1N1)), SG57 (A/Singapore/1/1957(H2N2)) and IN05 (A/Indonesia/5/2005(H5N1)) protomers connected by TTT linkers (purple discontinuous lines). The cH125/111 TTT construct is composed of protomers with NL09, SG57 and IN05 heads and PR8 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934/Mount Sinai (H1N1)) stalks. N- and C-termini of each protomer are colored in yellow and red, respectively, and the GCN4 trimerization motifs are colored in dark gray. b, f AlphaFold2-predicted structure of cH125 TTT (b) and cH125/111 TTT (f) (Supplementary Fig. 17, 18). c, g StrepTactinXT ELISA with StrepTactinXT-purified cH125 TTT (c) and cH125/111 TTT (g) proteins against a panel of HA head- (5J8, FluA-20, C05) and stalk-specific (CR8020, CR6261, CR9114, FI6v3) antibodies. Heatmap values correspond to the areas under the curve (AUC) of the binding curves in Supplementary Fig. 20b, d. d, h nsEM-generated 3D models (C3 symmetry) of the purified cH125 TTT (d) and cH125/111 TTT (h) proteins in complex with CR9114 Fabs. i nsEM-generated 2D class averages of the homotrimeric H1 GCN4, H2 GCN4 and H5 GCN4 proteins and the chimeric cH125/111 TTT protein in complex with Fabs of the H1-specific 2B05 antibody (colored in purple).Full size imageThe TTT platform allows for expression of chimeric influenza HA immunogensIn the influenza field, the combination of immunogens from diverse viral strains is well established106,107,108. For instance, most licensed seasonal influenza vaccines are quadrivalent, i.e., contain attenuated/inactivated viral particles or recombinant HA proteins from four different strains to increase the protective coverage109. Furthermore, the location of the most conserved epitopes on the stem region of the HA protein has led to the design of head-chimeric proteins with head and stem regions from different viral strains110. The combination of several proteins with the same stalk but different head regions results in broad stalk-specific immune responses110.We designed TTT constructs encoding both protomer- (cH125 TTT) and head-chimeric (cH125/111 TTT) HA trimers. The cH125 TTT construct encoded three HA protomers of influenza viruses from different group 1 subtypes, namely NL09 (A/Netherlands/602/2009(H1N1)), SG57 (A/Singapore/1/1957(H2N2)) and IN05 (A/Indonesia/5/2005(H5N1)) (Fig. 5a, b). On the other hand, the head chimeric cH125/111 TTT construct contained three protomers with identical PR8 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai(H1N1)) stems but different NL09, SG57 and IN05 heads (Fig. 5e, f). Similar to the H3 HA TTT construct, protomers were connected via 22-residue flexible linkers, which we visualized using AlphaFold2 (Supplementary Fig. 17, 18). As controls, we generated monomeric constructs encoding the first protomer of both cH125 TTT and cH125/111 TTT, i.e., monomeric NL09 (H1) (Fig. 5a) and monomeric NL09-head and PR8-stem (H1/1) (Fig. 5e). Additionally, we generated GCN4-trimerized controls encoding each of the three protomers of both chimeras, named H1 GCN4, H2 GCN4 and H5 GCN4 (Fig. 5a) and H1/1 GCN4, H2/1 GCN4 and H5/1 GCN4 (Fig. 5e), respectively.First, we performed a StrepTactinXT ELISA assay with the supernatant of HEK293T cells transfected with cH125 TTT, cH125/111 TTT and the corresponding controls, including also the H3 HA TTT homotrimeric construct (Supplementary Fig. 19). We evaluated the binding of both stem- (CR802097, CR6261111, CR911494, FI6v398) and head-specific (5J8112, FluA-2096, C0595) antibodies. All samples showed protein expression and, overall, the antigenic profile matched the specificities of the tested antibodies. CR8020 is a group 2-specific antibody97 and thus bound only to the H3 HA TTT sample. CR6261 is, on the contrary, a group 1-specific antibody111 and was reactive to the H1, H2 and H5 samples, but not to the H3 HA TTT control. Antibodies that are reactive to most influenza A viruses, such as CR911494, FI6v398 and FluA-2096, interacted well with all supernatant samples. 5J8 interacted only with constructs encoding H1 heads, as expected112. C05 has been reported to bind certain H1, H2, H3 heads95, but might not bind the specific H1 head (NL09) that we used in this case. The lower binding signals observed for CR6261, CR9114 and FI6v3 against cH125 TTT and cH125/111 TTT might be due to the stem breathing observed using nsEM (Fig. 5d, h)Next, we purified both chimeric HA TTT proteins and corresponding controls from transiently transfected HEK293F cells using StrepTactinXT affinity chromatography. As in the case of H3 HA TTT construct, both cH125 TTT (~0.2 mg/L) and cH125/111 TTT (~1.2 mg/L) presented lower purification yields than the monomeric and GCN4-trimerized controls (Table 1). However, both chimeric constructs expressed only covalently linked trimers, as evidenced by the single band of ~250 KDa observed on reducing SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 20a). Furthermore, StrepTactinXT ELISA assay with the purified protein preparations showed an antigenic profile matching the one observed with unpurified supernatants (Fig. 5c, g, Supplementary Fig. 20b, d). Also, the nanoDSF-measured Tm values of cH125 TTT (55.9 °C) and cH125/111 TTT (58.7 °C) were comparable to H3 HA TTT (54.5 °C), monomeric (56.6 °C and 56.7 °C for H1 and H1/1, respectively) and GCN4-trimerized controls (57.6 °C, 55.9 °C, 57.2 °C, 51.3 °C, and 61.0 °C for GCN4-trimerized H1, H5, H1/1, H2/1, and H5/1, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 20c, e, Table 1). Site-specific glycan analyses of cH125 TTT and cH125/111 TTT revealed that most PNGS were effectively populated by glycans (Supplementary Fig. 20f, Supplementary Table 10), and only the N20/21 site on the first protomer of cH125 TTT and the N483 sites of all three protomers of cH125/111 TTT presented some unoccupancy. The majority of sites were dominated by complex glycans, probably due to the lower density of glycosylation sites compared to the H3 HA TTT protein113.To assess the conformation of the purified proteins, we imaged them in complex with CR9114 Fabs (Fig. 5d, h, Supplementary Table 11). nsEM-generated 2D class averages showed that the H1 and H1/1 preparations contained mostly monomers, while the chimeric TTT and GCN4-trimerized preparations contained only trimers with three CR9114 Fabs bound (Fig. 5d, h, Supplementary Table 11). Reconstructed 3D models of these complexes, using both C3 (Fig. 5d, h) and C1 symmetries (Supplementary Fig. 21), showed that the head domains of both cH125 TTT and cH125/111 TTT appeared in an open conformation, exposing the conserved trimer interface region, which has been suggested to be a target of protective Abs114. To prove the chimeric nature of the cH125/111 TTT protein, we imaged it in complex with Fabs of the H1 head-specific 5J8 and 2B05115 antibodies. The resulting complexes were unstable and difficult to image. However, we were able to obtain 2D class averages in which H1 GCN4 presented three 2B05 Fabs bound, while cH125/111 TTT presented only one Fab bound, indicating that this latter protein contained only a single H1 head (Fig. 5i, Supplementary Table 11).In summary, the TTT design can be used for the controlled generation of chimeric Env and HA TTT constructs that express only as trimers and present the expected binding of broad as well as strain-specific antibodies.DiscussionExpression of many recombinant class I fusion glycoprotein constructs yields a heterogeneous mix of trimers, dimers and monomers, complicating their use in genetic vaccination approaches, including those based on viral vectors and mRNA. Here, we describe a novel design platform, termed ‘Triple Tandem Trimer’ (TTT), and validate it for the generation of HIV-1 Env and influenza HA immunogens that express only as trimers.Class I viral glycoprotein trimers, such as HIV-1 Env, influenza HA, SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RSV F protein, generally form dimers/monomers or adopt a post-fusion conformation when their transmembrane domain is removed. Therefore, heterologous trimerization domains, such as the GCN4 leucine zipper51,52,53, the bacteriophage T4 fibritin foldon54,55 and the molecular clamp116 domains, are used to generate soluble versions of these glycoproteins that acquire stable pre-fusion trimeric conformation. However, even with such trimerization domains, not all resulting glycoprotein molecules assemble as trimers59. Furthermore, these trimerization domains might negatively affect the conformation63 or antigenicity115 of the trimerized proteins. Lastly, their presence results in the elicitation of undesirable trimerization domain-specific antibody responses59. For example, the clamp trimerization domain, which is based on HIV-1 gp41, was used to generate a SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccinethat elicited anti-clamp antibodies that cross-reacted with widely used HIV diagnostics when tested in a phase I trial117. Therefore, the development of this vaccine candidate was halted. The nature of the TTT design largely circumvents these various disadvantages and promotes the formation of stable trimers.Protein fusion is a method widely used in the generation of recombinant proteins, as it allows for the merging of several functionalities and/or properties in a single molecule118,119,120,121,122. In most of these applications, the fused proteins are originally encoded by different genes and do not interact to form multimers. Moreover, the flexible linkers involved usually act as mere linkages that provide the spacing necessary for independent folding. The TTT fusion strategy here described is one of the first examples, in addition to the case of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs)123, in which the fused proteins are protomers of a multimeric protein and closely interact and depend on each other for proper folding and conformation. This strategy could be used in the future to assure the multimerization of any multimeric protein, provided that the N- and C- termini of neighbor protomers are relatively close to each other (like in Env and HA) or the addition of longer (and probably rigid) linkers is possible and does not affect the function or conformation of the protein.Env and HA TTT constructs efficiently express a higher proportion of well-folded trimers than conventional designs, and therefore represent promising candidates for gene-based vaccination. In this study, we provide proof of concept for the use of Env TTT using adenovirus and poxvirus vectors. The combination with other state-of-the-art and emerging delivery technologies, such as mRNA-LNPs43, self-amplifying RNAs46,47,124 and integrase-deficient lentivirus vectors (IDLVs)48,49, might further improve the induction of NAb responses. Here, we characterized the antigenicity of TTT proteins expressed in vitro. It would be important that future studies employing TTT constructs as nucleic acid-based vaccines evaluate relevant histological samples to confirm that TTT immunogens expressed in vivo present similar favorable antigenic profiles.Gly-Ser linkers are generally thought to be poorly immunogenic and have been widely used in the design of fusion proteins, including FDA-approved therapeutic scFvs, such as Brolucizumab125 and Tebentafusp126. No adverse immune reactions have been associated with the Gly-Ser linkers therein. Here, we confirmed that the inserted TTT linkers do not contribute to the formation of immunodominant neo-epitopes in the context of Env. Furthermore, we attempted to shield the trimer base and TTT linkers by incorporating glycosylation motifs on the SC and TTT linkers. However, these sites were not efficiently glycosylated, probably due to the high flexibility of the linkers. Further design efforts, based on glycosylation or other strategies, will be needed to ensure the immunosilencing of the trimer base and potential neo-epitopes derived from the inclusion of stabilizing modifications, if necessary.The glycan masking of the immunodominant BG505-specific 241/289 glycan hole is an established strategy to reduce the otherwise dominant BG505 strain-specific glycan hole-directed NAb responses70,127. In the present study, rabbits vaccinated with SOSIP.664 and TTT immunogens, which did not include 241/289 glycan-hole masking modifications and showed binding to the 241/289-targeting mAb 10A89, elicited autologous NAb responses likely dominated by 241/289-specific antibodies87,88,89,90. Conversely, rabbits vaccinated with 241/289-masked (TTT.GM) immunogens did not develop detectable BG505 NAb responses, consistent with the effective silencing of the 241/289 glycan hole. This modification could therefore facilitate immunofocusing to more desirable epitopes in germline-targeting and other epitope-focused vaccine approaches128,129,130,131. Env TTT immunogens present most of the epitopes targeted by bNAbs. However, like other soluble and furin-independent (SC, NFL, and UFO) Env immunogens, they might be less amenable for the induction of MPER- and fusion peptide-specific bNAbs.The combination of spike proteins from different viral strains or that target different steps of bNAb evolution is a promising approach for the generation of bNAbs against HIV-1 and influenza4. However, the diverse proteins are usually administered sequentially, in cocktail or as mosaic nanoparticles107,132,133,134. The chimeric Env and HA TTT immunogens here described can include three different immunogens in every single trimer, which might influence the immune profile compared to other combination vaccines. Additionally, chimeric TTT proteins containing protomers to target several steps of bNAb evolution might help to simplify sequential-based germline-targeting, shaping, and polishing vaccination strategies135, as well as accelerate the screening, approval, and manufacture of novel immunogens. Generating chimeric Env TTT antigens based on diverse gp140 subunits will probably require screening or additional optimization to ensure that the core residues of a chimeric TTT are compatible to improve folding and yield.Recently, especially after the success of mRNA and viral vector COVID-19 vaccines, a growing number of studies have focused on the design of membrane-bound glycoprotein immunogens. Membrane-bound glycoprotein immunogens present several advantages compared to soluble glycoproteins, including multimerization on the membrane thereby improving their immunogenicity, lack of exposure of the immunodominant trimer base, and maintenance of epitopes that are not present in soluble glycoproteins, such as the MPER domain on HIV-1 Env136,137,138. We envision that TTT proteins can also be presented on the membrane of cells or the surface of nanoparticles, by selecting appropriate transmembrane domains and nanoparticle systems. Furthermore, the TTT design, whether used for soluble antigens or membrane-anchored antigens, uniquely enables the generation of chimeric immunogens.As gene-based vaccination approaches have recently gained much momentum, methods that ensure the expression of predominantly correctly folded antigens from these platforms should facilitate capitalizing on this momentum for HIV-1, influenza, and other pathogens. The TTT platform might therefore be particularly suitable for next-generation gene-based vaccines aimed at induction of bNAbs.MethodsConstruct designThe BG505 SOSIP.664 construct (SOSIP.664), derived from the BG505 env gene (Genbank ADM31403.1), has been described elsewhere30. Briefly, SOSIP.664 constructs include a set of amino acid changes (HxB2 numbering) to improve the expression and stability of soluble Env trimers: a tPA signal peptide (MDAMKRGLCCVLLLCGAVFVSPSQEIHARFRRGAR); 332N in gp120 (introduction of epitopes of N332 glycan-dependent Abs); 501C-605C (gp120-gp41ECTO disulfide bond); 559P in gp41ECTO (trimer-stabilizing); REKR to RRRRRR (R6) in gp120 (furin cleavage enhancement); and a stop codon after residue 664 in gp41ECTO.The BG505 SOSIP.v8.4 gene, referred to as SOSIP.v8 throughout most of this manuscript for simplicity, was derived from the previously described BG505 SOSIP.v4.1 sequence64 by introducing several MD39 trimer-stabilizing mutations (106E, 271I, 288L, 304V, 319Y, 519S, 568D, 570H and 585H)65 (Supplementary Table 1). To generate the single-chain SOSIP.v8 (SC) construct, the R6 furin motif in SOSIP.v8 was replaced by a 15-residue flexible linker (GGSGGGGSGGGGSGG), similarly to previous studies35,36, and a secondary RCKR furin motif was eliminated (500K). The BG505 triple tandem trimer construct (BG505 TTT) was obtained by concatenating three SOSIP.v8 SC protomers via 11-residue flexible linkers (GSGGSGGSGSG).The glycan masked TTT construct (TTT.GM) was obtained by introducing several modifications to the BG505 TTT construct: 1) NxT PNGS motifs in every BG505 glycosylation site, except for 137 and 156 (NxS), in order to increase the overall glycan occupancy72; 2) PNGS motifs (241N, 291T) and compensatory mutations (240T, 290E) to close the BG505-specific 241/289 glycan hole that attracts narrow-NAb responses89; 3) PNGS motifs by introducing G/S to N changes in the TTT linkers (GSGGSNGSGSG) to mask the immunodominant base glycan hole.The chimeric Env TTT construct (chEnv TTT) comprises three protomers encoding SC versions of BG505 SOSIP.v4.1, ConM SOSIP.v7 and AMC011 SOSIP.v7, fused via 11-residue TTT linkers (GSGGSGGSGSG). The 241/289 strain-specific glycan hole of the BG505 protomer was masked as described above. Both ConM and AMC011 SOSIP.v7 sequences were designed similarly to previously described73, by addition of the SOSIP.v5.2 (73C-561C)102 and TD8 mutations (47D, 49E, 65K, 106T, 165L, 429R)139 to the ConM and AMC011 SOSIP.v4.2 constructs described elsewhere (Supplementary Table 1)73,140.The HA, HA TTT, and HA GCN4 constructs were based on the HA sequence of the NL03 virus isolate (A/Netherlands/213/2003(H3N2), Genbank ADM31403.1), positions 8-503 (H3 numbering). Flexible 22-residue TTT linkers (GSGGSGGSGSGGSGGSGGSGSG) were used to connect the three HA protomers comprising the TTT construct. SC linkers were not required as this HA sequence does not contain protease cleavage motifs. The HA GCN4 construct was generated by fusing a GCN4-pII isoleucine zipper trimerization motif (RMKQIEDKIEEILSKIYHIENEIARIKKLIGER)52,53,59 to the C-terminus of the HA construct via a flexible spacer linker (GSGGSGGSGGSGGS).The protomer-chimeric HA TTT construct (cH125 TTT) is composed of NL09 (A/Netherlands/602/2009(H1N1), Genbank CY039527.2), SG57 (A/Singapore/1/1957(H2N2), Genbank L11142.1) and IN05 (A/Indonesia/5/2005(H5N1), Genbank CY116646.1) protomers, while the head-chimeric HA TTT construct (cH125/111 TTT) contains three protomers with identical PR8 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai(H1N1), Genbank AAM75158.1) stalks but different NL09, SG57 and IN05 heads. In both constructs, the protomers were connected via 22-residue TTT linkers (GSGGSGGSGSGGSGGSGGSGSG) and included a Y98F mutation in the receptor binding site (RBS) region, which prevents non-specific hemagglutination while preserving the epitopes of known RBS-targeting bNAbs141. Similar to others, we replaced the QRESRRKKR multibasic cleavage site in the H5N1 sequence with QRETK142,143,144. Additionally, we deleted a furin motif in the H5N1 sequence (599 K).All constructs comprised the above-described sequences preceded by tissue plasminogen activator (MDAMKRGLCCVLLLCGAVFVSPSQEIHARFRRGAR) or synthetic leader (MDRAKLLLLLLLLLLPQAQA) signal peptides. Untagged Env constructs presented a STOP codon after position 664. Strep-tagged constructs included an additional Twin-Strep-Tag amino acid sequence (GSGGSSAWSHPQFEKGGGSGGGSGGSAWSHPQFEKG) after positions 664 (Env) or 503 (HA), except for the GCN4-trimerized constructs, which included a Strep-TagII (GGRSGWSHPQFEK) after the GCN4 trimerization domain. D7324-tagged gp120, SOSIP.664 and SOSIP.v8 proteins used for assessing antibody binding responses were expressed from constructs with a C-terminal D7324 tag (GSAPTKAKRRVVQREKR) after position 664. In every case, the underlined GS residues were encoded by a BamHI restriction site useful for cloning purposes.Genes were codon-optimized and synthesized by Genscript or Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), and cloned by restriction-ligation into a pPI4 plasmid. For TTT constructs, especially the ones intended to be delivered by ChAdOx1 and MVA viral vectors, we applied specific optimization considerations and manually optimized each of the three protomer units differently to avoid repeat-mediated gene instability. Subcloning into ChAdOx1 and MVA vectors was achieved by priorly introducing 5’ KpnI/SmaI and 3’ NotI restriction sites.Protein expressionProteins encoded by the described constructs were expressed either in adherent HEK293T or suspension HEK293F cells, as previously described64,70. HEK293T cells (ATCC, cat. no. CRL-11268) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 µg/mL); and transfected as previously described64. Three days after transfection, HEK293T supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.22 µm pore size) and directly used in supernatant ELISA and BLI assays. Suspension HEK293F cells (Invitrogen, cat. no. R79009) were cultured in FreeStyle Expression Medium (Gibco) and, 5–7 days post-transfection, supernatants were harvested, centrifuged and filtered using 0.22 µm Steritops (Millipore) before protein purification. For transfection, Env- or HA-encoding plasmids were mixed with PEImax (Polysciences, cat. no. 24765) in a 3:1 (w/w) PEImax to DNA ratio. Co-transfection with a furin protease-encoding plasmid was performed in a 4:1 Env to furin ratio only when explicitly indicated.Protein purification and profilingUntagged proteins were purified by Galanthus Nivalis Lectin (GNL) affinity chromatography. Briefly, filtered HEK293F supernatants containing the expressed proteins were flowed (0.5–1.0 mL/min) over Econo-Column chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) containing 1–2 mL of agarose bound GNL (Vector Laboratories, cat. no. AL-1243), at 4 °C. After washing with five column volumes of PBS, proteins were eluted with a 1 M α-methyl-D-mannopyranoside (Acros Organics) pH 8.0 solution.Supernatants containing proteins with C-terminal Strep-Tag peptides were purified by StrepTactinXT affinity chromatography. First, supernatants were mixed with 1 mL of BioLock biotin blocking solution (IBA, cat. no. 2-0205) and 110 mL of 10x Buffer W (1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 1.5 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA) per liter of supernatant. Then, the mixtures were incubated for a minimum of 15 min at 4 °C before passing them (0.5–1.0 mL/min) through StrepTactinXT Superflow (IBA, cat. no. 2-1208) resin beds packed in Econo-Column chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). Columns were washed with ten column volumes of 1x Buffer W, and elution of the retained proteins was performed with 1x BXT elution buffer (IBA, cat. no. 2-1042).The BG505 TTT protein for X-ray crystallography and the chEnv TTT protein were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using 2G12 and PGT145 bNAbs, respectively, similarly to previously described70. Briefly, unpurified proteins contained in the supernatant of transfected HEK293F cells were immobilized on 2G12 or PGT145 functionalized CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B columns (Cytiva, cat. no. 17–0430) by flowing at 1 mL/min or overnight incubation at 4 °C on a roller bank. After washing with three column volumes of 0.5 M NaCl and 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, proteins were eluted with 3 M MgCl2 pH 7.5.All eluted proteins were subsequently buffer exchanged to PBS or TBS by using Vivaspin20 ultrafiltration units (Sartorius) with MWCO 50 kDa (Env) or 10 kDa (HA). Protein concentrations were calculated using A280 values measured on a NanoDrop2000 device (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the molecular weight and extinction coefficient values estimated by the ProtParam Expasy webtool.Some of the affinity chromatography-purified proteins were run through a Superdex200 Increase 10/300 GL column integrated in an NGC chromatography system (Bio-Rad) to obtain a profile of the content in different species (aggregates, trimers, dimers, monomers) in the protein preparations or to remove non-Env impurities from the GNL-purified proteins used in immunization experiments. A Superose6 Increase 10/300 GL column was used to remove aggregates from the PGT145-purified chEnv TTT protein preparation.SDS-PAGE and BN-PAGEProteins were run through Novex Wedgewell 4–12% Tris-Glycine and NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris (Thermo Fisher Scientific) polyacrylamide gels for their SDS-PAGE and BN-PAGE analyses, respectively64. Subsequently, gels were stained with PageBlue Protein Staining Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Colloidal Blue Staining Kit (Life Technologies), respectively. Uncropped images of the gels are presented in Supplementary Fig. 22. Proteins presented in each gel were processed in parallel.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Lectin-capture ELISA experiments were performed as previously described. Briefly, Galanthus nivalis lectin (Vector Laboratories, cat. no. L-1240) at 20 µg/mL in 0.1 M NaHCO3 pH 8.6 was immobilized on half-area 96-well plates (Corning) by overnight incubation at 4 °C. After blocking with Casein Blocker in TBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 37532), 100 µL of purified proteins in TBS (1 µg/mL) or unpurified cell supernatants were dispensed in the corresponding wells for protein immobilization by a 2 h incubation at room temperature. Subsequent steps to measure binding of the test antibodies were performed similarly to previously described70. Briefly, following a double wash step with TBS to remove unbound proteins, 3-fold (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4) or 4-fold (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 20) serial dilutions of test primary antibodies in Casein Blocker were added and incubated for 2 h. Starting dilutions were at 1 µg/mL (2G12, VRC01, PGT145, VRC26.25, CR8020, CR6261, CR9114, Fi6v3, 5J8, FluA-20, and C05), 3 µg/mL (PGT121, PG16, 35022, PGT151), or 15 µg/mL (F105). After 3 washes with TBS, HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 109-035-003) diluted 1:3000 in Casein Blocker was added and incubated for 1 h, followed by 5 washes with TBS/0.05% Tween20. A developing solution (1% 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. T2885), 0.01% H2O2, 100 mM sodium acetate, and 100 mM citric acid) allowed the colorimetric reaction, which was stopped by the addition of 0.8 M H2SO4. Finally, color development (absorption at 450 nm, OD450) was measured to obtain the binding curves.StrepTactinXT ELISA assays were performed following the same procedures as lectin-capture assays, with the difference that StrepTactinXT coated microplates (IBA, cat. no. 2-5101-001) did not require any functionalization or blocking steps prior to protein immobilization.Endpoint antibody titers from mouse and rabbit sera samples against SOSIP.664, SOSIP.v8 and gp120 proteins were determined in a D7324-capture ELISA, using half-area 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, cat. no. 675061) precoated with anti-D7324 antibody (Aalto Bioreagents, cat. no. D7324) at 10 µg/mL in 0.1 M NaHCO3 pH 8.6 overnight, similarly to previously described22. Alternatively, to determine TTT linker-targeting antibody responses, half-area 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with a N-terminally biotinylated GSGGSGGSGSG peptide (Genscript) at 2.5 µg/mL in PBS. Poly-HRP Streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. N200) was used to confirm the immobilization of the GSGGSGGSGSG peptide. The subsequent steps in the assay were similar to the ones described for lectin-capture ELISA, with the exception that primary and secondary antibodies were replaced by sera diluted in TBS/2% skimmed milk/20% sheep serum and HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 115-035-003) or goat anti-rabbit IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 111-035-003), respectively.Biolayer interferometry (BLI)An Octet K2 (ForteBio) device was used to measure the binding of antibodies at 30 °C and 1000 rpm agitation. Purified proteins were diluted in BLI kinetics buffer (PBS/0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.02% Tween20) to 100 nM. First, test antibodies diluted in kinetics buffer were loaded on protein A sensors (ForteBio) to a final interference pattern shift of 1 nm. To obtain a baseline prior to protein association, sensors were equilibrated in kinetics buffer for 60 s. Association and dissociation of glycoproteins were measured for 300 s. Binding data were pre-processed and exported using the Octet software.BLI experiments on cell supernatants diluted in BLI kinetics buffer were conducted similarly to described above. However, to avoid non-specific binding to other supernatant components, we loaded antibodies to a binding threshold of 2 nm and replaced the kinetics buffer for a mock transfected supernatant for baseline and dissociation steps. When needed, the baseline step was prolonged to 300 s to allow the signal to level out.Nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF)Protein thermostability was evaluated with a Prometheus NT.48 instrument (NanoTemper Technologies). Proteins at a concentration of 1 mg/mL were loaded to the grade capillaries and the intrinsic fluorescence signal was measured while temperature was increased by 1 °C/min, with an excitation power of 40%. The temperatures of melting (Tm) were determined using the Prometheus NT software.Sample preparation and analysis by LC-MSFor protein samples to be analyzed by LC-MS, three separate 50 μg aliquots were denatured for 1 h in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 containing 6 M of urea and 5 mM of dithiothreitol (DTT). Next, the proteins were reduced and alkylated by adding 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) and incubated for 1 h in the dark, followed by incubation with DTT to get rid of any residual IAA. The alkylated proteins were buffer-exchanged into 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 using Vivaspin columns (3 kDa), and digested separately overnight using trypsin, chymotrypsin (Mass Spectrometry Grade, Promega) or alpha lytic protease (Sigma-Aldrich) at a ratio of 1:30 (w/w). The peptides were dried and extracted using C18 Zip-tip (Merck Millipore). The peptides were dried again, re-suspended in 0.1% formic acid and analyzed by nanoLC-ESI MS with an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) system coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using stepped higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation (15, 25, 45%). Peptides were separated using an EasySpray PepMap RSLC C18 column (75 µm × 75 cm). A trapping column (PepMap 100 C18 3 μm (particle size), 75 μm × 2 cm) was used in line with the LC prior to separation with the analytical column. The LC conditions were as follows: 275 min linear gradient consisting of 0–32% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 240 min followed by 35 min of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The flow rate was set to 200 nL/min. The spray voltage was set to 2.7 kV and the temperature of the heated capillary was set to 40 °C. The ion transfer tube temperature was set to 275 °C. The scan range was 400−1600 m/z. The HCD collision energy was set to 50%. Precursor and fragment detection were performed using Orbitrap at a resolution MS1 = 100,000. MS2 = 30,000. The AGC target for MS1 = 45 and MS2 = 54 and injection time: MS1 = 50 ms, MS2 = 54 ms.Data processing of LC-MS dataGlycopeptide fragmentation data were extracted from the raw file using Byos v3.5 (Protein Metrics Inc.). The following parameters were used for data searches in Byonic: The precursor mass tolerance was set at 4 ppm and 10 ppm for fragments. Peptide modifications included in the search include: Cys carbamidomethyl, Met oxidation, Glu pyroGlu, Gln pyroGln and N deamidation. For each protease digest, a separate search node was used with digestion parameters appropriate for each protease (Trypsin RK, Chymotrypsin YFW and ALP TASV) using a semi-specific search with 2 missed cleavages. A 1% false discovery rate (FDR) was applied. All three digests were combined into a single file for downstream analysis. All charge states for a single glycopeptide were summed. The glycopeptide fragmentation data were evaluated manually for each glycopeptide; the peptide was scored as true-positive when the correct b and y fragment ions were observed along with oxonium ions corresponding to the glycan identified. The protein metrics 309 mammalian N-glycan library was modified to include sulfated glycans and phosphorylated mannose species, although no phosphorylated mannose glycans were detected on any of the samples analyzed. The relative amounts (determined by comparing the XIC of each glycopeptide, summing charge states) of each glycan at each site as well as the unoccupied proportion were determined by comparing the extracted chromatographic areas for different glycotypes with an identical peptide sequence. Glycans were categorized according to the composition detected. HexNAc(2), Hex(9−3) was classified as M9 to M3. HexNAc(3)Hex(5−6)Neu5Ac (0–4) was classified as Hybrid with HexNAc(3)Hex(5–6)Fuc(1)NeuAc(0–1) classified as Fhybrid. These glycans constituted the high mannose category. Complex-type glycans were classified according to the number of processed antenna and fucosylation. Complex glycans are categorized as HexNAc(3)(X), HexNAc(3)(F)(X), HexNAc(4)(X), HexNAc(4)(F)(X), HexNAc(5)(X), HexNAc(5)(F)(X), HexNAc(6+)(X) and HexNAc(6+)(F)(X).In silico protein modelingProtein molecular graphics were generated with the UCSF ChimeraX 1.4 software145. The AlphaFold v2.0 software (DeepMind)146 was used to predict protein structures.Negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM)Purified proteins or immune complexes were imaged by nsEM essentially as described elsewhere115,147. Immune complexes were prepared by incubating Fabs and Env or HA proteins at greater than a 3:1 molar ratio for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, 3 μL of purified proteins or immune complexes (∼0.02 mg/mL) were applied onto glow discharged (20 mA for 30 s) carbon-coated 400 mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences). After 5 s, they were negatively stained with 2% w/v uranyl formate for 60 s. Samples were imaged using a FEI Tecnai T12 electron microscope operating at 120 keV. Micrographs were collected with Leginon148 and single particles were processed using Appion149, Relion150 and XQuartz. The UCSF Chimera software was used to map the footprints and make the figures. Fabs on 2D class average and 3D model figures were colored using Photoshop.Crystallization and data collectionTo determine the structure of BG505 TTT, trimers were complexed with PGT124 Fabs and 35O22 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) (in a 3.5:3.5:1 molar ratio of Fab:scFv:trimer) at room temperature for 30 min. The resulting complexes were digested with EndoH glycosidase (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the digested complexes were purified by size exclusion using a Superdex200 16/600 column (GE Healthcare) and concentrated to 10.7 mg/mL, before being subjected to crystallization screening at both 4 °C and 20 °C using the high-throughput CrystalMation robotic system (Rigaku) at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). High-quality crystals were obtained via sitting drops in 0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.2 M zinc acetate, 11.5% (w/v) PEG 3000, pH 4.83, at 4 °C. These crystals were harvested with 15% glycerol as cryoprotectant and were immediately cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data were collected at the SSRL12-1 beamlines (Supplementary Table 3).Structure determination and refinementThe crystals of BG505 TTT + PGT124 Fab + 35O22 scFv complex diffracted to 5.8 Å. The dataset was indexed, integrated and scaled using HKL2000151 in a C2 space group. The structures of BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 (PDB 5CEZ), PGT124 (PDB 4R26) and 35O22 scFv (PDB 6MTJ) were used as search models for molecular replacement. The complex structure was then built and refined via different iterations of Coot152 and Phenix153. The final Rcryst and Rfree values were 25.5% and 29.2%, respectively, with 97.8% completeness (Supplementary Table 3). The Fab/scFv residues were numbered according to Kabat et al.154 and Env residues using HxB2 numbering.Construction of the ChAdOx1- and MVA-vectored vaccinesVaccine vector ChAdOx1 is derived from simian (chimpanzee) adenovirus isolate Y25 of adenovirus group E74. The recombinant ChAdOx1 were generated similarly as described elsewhere80,155. Briefly, the SOSIP.664, TTT and TTT.GM constructs were inserted into the E1 locus of the adenovirus genome under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, while the adenovirus genome was stably integrated in a bacterial artificial chromosome. The recombinant ChAdOx1 vaccines were rescued by transfection of purified excised genomic DNA into HEK293A T-REX (tetracycline-sensitive repressor of transgene expression used for preparation of ChAdOx1-vectored vaccines) cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The transgene presence and absence of contaminating empty parental adenovirus in the virus stock was confirmed by PCR, and the virus was titered and stored at −80 °C until use.To generate recombinant MVA vaccines80,155, the SOSIP.664, TTT and TTT.GM constructs were inserted directly into the MVA genome by homologous recombination in chicken embryo fibroblast cells. The expression cassette was directed under the control of the modified H5 poxvirus promoter and into the thymidine kinase locus of the MVA genome. Finally, the co-inserted EGFP marker was removed by trans-dominant recombination to generate markerless MVA vaccines. The virus was plaque purified, expanded, purified on a 36% sucrose cushion, tittered, the expression of the transgene product was confirmed on Western Blot and the virus stock was stored at −80 °C until use.Western blot to detect TTT expressionEighty percent confluent HeLa cells in six-well plates were infected with ChAdOx1.BG505 TTT or MVA.BG505 TTT for 1 h and incubated subsequently at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h before the cells were lysed with 300 µl M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 78501). A volume of 10 µl was resolved on a 3–8% Tris Acetate gel, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with anti-HIV-1 Env mouse monoclonal antibody ARP3119 (Centre for AIDS Reagents, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control). Secondary antibody was a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 715-035-150) and detection was by adding a chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 32106).Mouse immunizationTwo groups of six-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Envigo (UK) and housed in Blue Line 1285 L individually ventilated cages (Tecniplast) at the Functional Genomics Facility, University of Oxford. Mice were immunized intramuscularly at weeks 0, 4, and 8, while under general anesthesia established using isoflurane vaporizing Oxygenator OC-P50. The immunization involved the administration of either 108 infectious units (IU) of recombinant ChAdOx1, 5 × 108 plaque-forming units (PFU) of recombinant MVA, or 10 μg of protein adjuvanted with AddaVax (Invivogen)156,157. Blood samples were collected at weeks 2, 6, and 10. Mice were euthanized in a chamber by first rendering them unconscious using isoflurane, followed by the gradual CO2 filling method and subsequent decapitation. The first two steps take place automatically and sequentially when the start button is pressed.All mouse immunization procedures and care were approved by the local Clinical Medicine Ethical Review Committee, University of Oxford, and conformed strictly to the United Kingdom Home Office Guidelines under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Experiments were conducted under project license PP1892852 held by T.H.Rabbit immunizationThe rabbit immunization experiment was performed by Pocono Rabbit Farm & Lab (Canadensis, USA), using 1-year-old female New Zealand rabbits bred in-house and maintained in individual cages at 16–21 °C, 30–70% humidity, and under 12 h light/12 h darkness cycles. Rabbits, distributed in seven groups (six animals per group), were immunized at 4 different timepoints (weeks 0, 8, 24, and 40) with either 5 × 1010 IU of recombinant ChAdOx1, 108 PFU of recombinant MVA, or 30 μg of PGT145- or GNL-purified Env protein adjuvanted with Squalene emulsion (SE) adjuvant (Polymun Scientific) in a 1:1 Env in PBS to SE ratio (v/v). Each immunization consisted of two intramuscular injections (2 × 250 µL) on both quadriceps of each animal. Blood samples were collected at weeks 0, 4, 8, 10, 16, 24, 26, 35, 40, and 42.All rabbit immunization procedures complied with the relevant ethical regulations and protocols of the Pocono Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), with approval code PRF2A. For all immunization and bleed protocols, pain and distress were slight and momentary and did not affect animals health. Discomfort and injury to animals were limited to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically valuable research. Analgesics, anesthetics and tranquilizing drugs were administered by veterinary staff when necessary. After the completion of all immunizations and bleeds, rabbits were euthanized by anesthesia followed by exsanguination via cardiac puncture. Anesthesia was induced via intravenous ear injection with a combination of ketamine and xylazine, administered following an approved anesthesia chart set in place by the attending veterinarian according to Formulary for Laboratory Animals, 3rd Edition. Procedures for adverse reactions to immunization followed established practices that include measures for dealing with unexpected outcomes. For example, if an animal had an adverse reaction at the injection site, depending on the severity, the response would be either (a) none in the case of mild reactions, (b) anesthetic in the case of medium reactions, and (c) veterinary staff would be brought in for severe cases, in which it may be necessary to euthanize via intravenous administration of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg), according to guidelines established in 1993 by the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia. However, in this study, reactions to all procedures were only mild and no animals were euthanized over the course of immunizations and bleeds. Two rabbits (37182 and 37216) died unexpectedly, but this was considered to be unrelated to the immunization and bleed procedures.Neutralization assaysTZM-bl neutralization assays were performed essentially as described elsewhere30,158. A BG505/T332N pseudovirus was used to assess the autologous neutralizing responses. The TZM-bl reporter cell line159 was obtained from John C. Kappes, Xiaoyun Wu and Tranzyme Inc. through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program, NIAID, NIH. The ID50 values were determined as the sera dilution at which infectivity was inhibited by 50%.Mice IgGs were purified from sera of immunized animals, essentially as described elsewhere87. Briefly, sera were incubated with protein A/G Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C, at a ratio of 1 mL packed resin per milliliter of undiluted serum. The resin was washed 3 times with 10 column volumes of PBS, before eluting the IgGs with 5–10 volumes of 0.1 M glycine pH 2.5. Samples were immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCL pH 8.0. Finally, buffer was exchanged to PBS (same volume of the initial serum) using 10 kDa MWCO Vivaspin6 filters (Sartorius) and the resulting preparations were used to measure BG505/T332N neutralization as described above.Data representation and statistical analysesAll data representation and statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism 9.1.2. Groups were compared using unpaired two-tailed Mann–Whitney U test.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

How bad could this be for dairy farms? Could it spread among people? Here's what scientists are learning. Shots Health News From NPR Your Health Treatments & Tests Health Inc. Policy-ish Public Health Twitter Public Health What to know about the risks of the bird flu outbreak April 4, 20245:00 AM ET By Will Stone Enlarge this image An outbreak of bird flu is affecting dairy cows in the U.S. Charlie Neibergall/AP hide caption toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP An outbreak of bird flu is affecting dairy cows in the U.S. Charlie Neibergall/AP The recent spread of avian influenza in dairy cattle in the U.S. has startled even some scientists who've tracked a global outbreak of the virus over the last few years. "There's a heap of unknowns right now," says Richard Webby, a virologist at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. How widespread is the virus in dairy cattle? What could this mean for humans? None of this is clear yet. The first cases of this H5N1 bird flu strain emerged in North America among wild migratory birds in late 2021 and soon spread to poultry farms. It's now showing up among dairy cows and at a major egg producer and one person who had close contact with cows has been infected. Sponsor Message "This particular version of the H5N1 virus is teaching us that some of the things we thought we knew about flu were wrong," Webby says. The current outbreak has affected many new wild bird species and persisted for longer than previous ones. The virus has also popped up more often in mammals, both in the wild and on farms, and at times led to a wave of infections and death. "We are in fairly unprecedented, uncharted territory, globally in relationship to avian influenza," says Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, director of the UW Center for One Health Research. National A bird flu outbreak at the largest U.S. chicken egg producer could affect egg prices But federal officials and scientists stress the risk to the public still remains low. So far, the virus does not appear to have mutated in a way that would make it significantly more dangerous. While concerning, the one human case, they say, is consistent with how people usually catch these viruses, through direct exposure to a sick animal. But scientists are watching this outbreak closely. Here's more of what they are learning. Goats and Soda How do pandemics begin? There's a new theory — and a new strategy to thwart them 1. Genetic sequencing shows 'minor' changes in the virus, nothing alarming While it's still early days, Webby says the genetic sequencing collected from infected cattle hasn't turned up anything that "immediately screams, this virus has changed, and that's why these cows are getting infected." "It just seems to be fairly typical of the viruses that have been detected in birds in various regions," he says. Sequencing of the virus in the Texas patient did show "minor changes," including one mutation associated with viral adaptation to mammals that's appeared in other human cases, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sponsor Message However, there's no indication from those previous infections that this mutation makes the virus more likely to spread among humans. This change does seem to have happened when the virus jumped from a cow to the person, but there's nothing altogether alarming about it, says Angie Rasmussen. "It doesn't look like there's any indication that this has adapted itself to spread efficiently between humans, and to routinely cause severe disease," says Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan. But she says this human case and the infections in dairy cattle are clear warnings: "The less human or cow transmission we have, the fewer of these mutations the virus can acquire." 2. Human-to-human spread of bird flu remains extremely rare It's generally rare for people to catch any type of bird flu and human-to-human spread is even rarer. During the current outbreak, this version of H5N1 has only been detected in a handful of humans in the last few years globally, and there aren't any documeneted cases of human-to-human transmission. In the Texas case, the person's only symptom was eye redness after being exposed to cattle. It's the second known H5N1 infection of a human in the U.S. In 2022, a poultry worker in Colorado was exposed to sick chickens and developed a mild illness. Some recent human infections have led to severe illness in other countries, including Ecuador, Chile and China. "This is a virus that doesn't infect humans very well, but can — not all the time — cause very significant disease when it does." Historically, human infections with avian influenza were often traced back to close contact with birds, specifically in markets or on farms. "If you're exposed to bird feces, if you're exposed to dead birds, if you're around a lot of live birds, you're going to be exposed to more of that," says Rasmussen. Sponsor Message Unlike the seasonal influenza viruses that infects humans, H5N1 doesn't have the ability to easily attack our upper respiratory tract, so it doesn't tend to spread among humans. However, the virus can bind to receptors in the lower respiratory tract. This may be one reason that people who develop respiratory infections with bird flu "can get very, very sick with severe pneumonia because those receptors are located deep in the lungs," says Rasmussen. Of course, scientists are looking out for any signs that the virus has adapted to better target our upper respiratory tract. The recent case in Texas also raises the possibility of "mucosal exposure," meaning the person may have come in contact with the virus and then touched their eyes, although the details and what that might mean for tranmission are unclear, she says. 3. Cows may be spreading it to one another, but it's not proving deadly A central question for scientists right now is whether there's significant transmission of the virus between dairy cattle. Cases have been detected in herds in Texas, Michigan, Kansas and New Mexico, and are suspected in other states, as well. Evidence suggests infected wild birds may have been the initial source of the infection, but "it's hard to explain exactly what's going on without some degree of mammal-to-mammal spread," says Webby. Others tracking the outbreak agree. "The way people are telling me it gets on their farm and moves, I'd be very surprised if this was not being spread from cow to cow," says Joe Armstrong, a veterinarian at the University of Minnesota. In early February, Armstrong started tracking reports of a mysterious illness in dairy cattle on the Texas panhandle and other states. He says just how many of these cases can be attributed to avian influenza still remains fuzzy. Sponsor Message "If we have wild birds involved and other wildlife, it's almost impossible to keep livestock and wildlife separate completely," he says. While cows are falling sick, it's not proving to be deadly, says Armstrong. And so far, federal officials emphasize the commercial milk supply is not at risk because products are pasteurized. 4. Sustained spread between mammals could potentially lead to more problematic mutations Currently it's not clear exactly how bird flu is spreading among mammals, and to what extent infections are mostly happening after some kind of contact with infected birds. But scientists worry about sustained mammal to mammal transmission of avian influenza because that gives the virus more opportunities to adapt to that host and acquire mutations that could make it better suited to mammals. There have been large die offs of marine mammals in South America and a particularly alarming outbreak on a mink farm in Spain. In both of those examples, the virus had evolved a couple of "mammal adaptive mutations" that haven't yet been seen in cows, says Louise Moncla, a virologist at the University of Pennsylvania. Cows are typically infected by a different type of influenza, so that makes it hard to speculate about the risk posed to humans. "It's just simply very unusual and very odd," says Moncla. Unlike pigs — known to be intermediary hosts for human and bird viruses — there is no data that show that cows are an important intermediary host for these viruses, she says. 5. An existing bird flu vaccine could be tapped and adapted in case of human spread An ongoing outbreak in livestock not only threatens the industry, but also makes it more likely that other animals will be exposed, or the workers themselves. "In general, we have not paid a lot of attention to these workers, even though they've often been sort of like the canary in the coal mine, the first evidence of a transmission event," says Rabinowitz. Sponsor Message Federal health officials stress that they are taking the situation seriously. 'The United States has been preparing for avian flu outbreaks for more than 20 years," CDC director Dr. Mandy Cohen told NPR's All Things Considered. "It's very different from what we experienced, for example, at the beginning of COVID, when we were seeing a brand new novel virus where we didn't have tests, we didn't have treatment and we didn't have vaccine." The U.S has a limited stockpile of vaccines that were developed for early strains of H5N1 that could be tapped if there's any human-to-human spread. Immune-stimulating ingredients, known as adjuvants, can be added to these older vaccines in order to broaden the immune response so that it better covers mismatched strains. In addition, mRNA technology could be leveraged to produce new vaccines, says Dr. Wilbur Chen, at the University of Maryland's School of Medicine. "All of those can be used in a pandemic response," he says, Chen says part of the ongoing preparation for the possibility of more human cases could include manufacturing limited quantities of vaccines. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's school of public health, says he would not be surprised if there are more cases in humans, most likely other farm workers. But he says it's not yet time to start mobilizing a larger pandemic response — say, pumping out millions of vaccines — because the chances that will be needed are very very low. "If you are seeing it widespread in farm workers, you want to think about vaccinating farm workers. If you start seeing it in non farm workers with evidence of human-to-human transmission, that's when you start wanting to think about vaccinating a much broader set of the population," he says.

This is the second case in a person in the U.S. in the current outbreak. The dairy worker has recovered, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk to the public remains low.A person in Texas has tested positive for the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1), also known as bird flu, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed. This individual, who was exposed to cattle that were believed to be infected with the virus, reported eye redness—a sign of conjunctivitis—but no other symptoms. The patient is being treated with antiviral medication and is recovering.Avian flu has been ripping through farmed poultry and wild bird populations around the world in recent years. It has also infected mammalian species ranging from foxes, bears and seals to cats and dogs. And in recent weeks, infections have been found in cattle in six U.S. states: Kansas, Texas, Michigan, New Mexico, Idaho and Ohio.* There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission so far, and the CDC says the risk to the public remains low.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

That patient reported mild fatigue and later recovered. Previous cases of avian flu in humans were deadly, but they involved a different form of the virus than the one that is currently circulating.Scientific American talked to Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, about the latest human case and the risk to human health more broadly.[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]How worried should we be about the human bird flu case in Texas?First of all, there’s some clarification here. Neither of these two cases [in the U.S.] has been an actual influenza infection as you think of a respiratory infection. They both have been basically either a nasal swab detection, for the previous one, or in the case of this one, a conjunctivitis—an eye infection. So this isn’t classic influenza at all.The first one was just someone who was tested routinely. They were working in a barn, depopulating the birds that were dying from flu, and they had some mild symptoms, and they just got tested. They don’t know if the symptoms were related to it, and it could have been that the virus was just picked up in the nose because of just inhaling it in. The second case is a case of conjunctivitis. So that’s not, again, unexpected in that there are receptor sites in the eye for influenza viruses.That’s reassuring. How likely is the virus to spread more widely among people?The risk assessment from both [the World Health Organization] and CDC remains that there is low risk for humans with this virus, and I support that. If you look at the cases that have occurred since 1997, when it first emerged in human cases Hong Kong, through to mid-2015 to 2016, those years were by far the highest-risk situation. We’ve seen very few cases in humans since then. And part of that is that the virus has changed—it’s mutated to the point of where it is infecting other mammalian species and birds at an increasing rate. But we’ve had no evidence yet that that’s happened for humans or for pigs. And pigs would be the animal species that, to me, would be the sentinel that I’d be most concerned about.Why is H5N1 causing milder human infections now?This virus just is not infecting lower parts of the respiratory tract in humans at this point. Now that can all change in a heartbeat with additional mutations. But at least for now, it’s not an issue.Previously there have been fatal cases of avian flu in humans in other countries, however. What does that tell us about the risk of human spread?We’ve been here before. When we saw a major increase in transmission, in human cases, in Indonesia and Thailand and other countries in the 2003–2007 time period, the message was “This is going to be a pandemic virus soon.” Then nothing happened. Then, in 2012, I was at that time on the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, and we had data presented to that group that essentially said, “We’re just one mutation away from the virus becoming a major pandemic virus.” It didn’t happen. Then, if you look at 2015, that was when we saw the major increase in cases in Africa—in Egypt, along the Nile River Valley, in people raising domestic ducks. That time there were [hundreds of] cases in Egypt alone that year in humans. And the thought was that, you know, “it’s just imminent now that we're going to see an influenza pandemic from H5N1.” Nothing happened.And so I think that we’ve had lessons in the past to be careful about making the leap to “this is going to happen.” At the same time, you know, you have to keep your eye on it. With all the influenza viruses collectively, you have to sleep with one eye open every night if you’re worried about a pandemic.Why were some of those earlier cases of H5N1 so deadly?The virus was able to reach receptor sites and cells deeper in the respiratory tract and cause human infection. And it was obviously a severe issue. But even then, we had no evidence these were person-to-person transmitted cases. The exposures were [traced] back to the animals. We haven’t seen any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.Did the current case in the U.S. likely involve a person becoming infected because of contact with a cow?I can’t speak to which animal it was contact-wise, but that could very well be. There was some question as to whether or not there was also contact with birds on the same farm. So either way, it’s clearly an animal exposure.How would we know if the virus was spreading more widely in people?First, you have to have a confirmed case in a human of a respiratory-transmitted virus that then resulted in severe-to-moderate respiratory illness—and then you just start picking up additional human cases in that area.Are scientists watching H5N1 closely to see how it evolves?We’re going to be tracking the virus to see is it changing genetically and if the [avian flu group] 2.3.4.4b is the same virus we’re seeing here with the wild birds. In the humans, we have not seen any changes in the virus yet that would support that it’s now more human-adapted. That’s going to be one thing we’ll be looking for. The second thing is just looking at the epidemiology: Are there people who are in contact with potential cases? I say “potential” because we have not had a respiratory transmitted virus case yet in the U.S. So I think that will be important. If we see one, will we see others around it?Could people become infected by consuming unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat from an infected cow or other animal?Yeah, well, unpasteurized milk and cheeses I would surely avoid. But I’ve been saying that for 50 years for a whole lot of other reasons, too, public-health-wise. Surely, this is just one more addition to that. I think the second thing is, of course, that, at this point, what data we have supports that pasteurization will kill the virus in the milk.But could you actually become infected by drinking milk containing the virus?We don’t know. Will taking the virus down your throat, into your larynx, will that cause the exposure of the virus to cells with the right receptor sites? We don’t know that yet. It’s possible.How is the fact that H5N1 is infecting cows and goats likely to affect the livestock industry?I don’t know. I mean, we’ll know in the weeks ahead. This is the time of the year we expect to see migratory birds bringing the virus into many communities that have not seen the virus for months. And each time that happens it's kind of a throw at the genetic roulette table, and we'll see what happens. We don't know. But it's all the more reason why we need to be better prepared for the next pandemic.At this point, again, the virus, as it is, I don't believe poses a major risk to humans. But that, as I said, could change overnight if there were mutational changes to the virus.*Editor’s Note (4/11/24): This sentence was edited after posting to correct the description of states where H5N1 has been detected in cattle.Rights & PermissionsTanya Lewis is a senior editor covering health and medicine at Scientific American.

This analysis supports the conclusion that the overall risk to the general public associated with the ongoing HPAI A(H5N1) outbreak has not changed and remains low at this time. CDC Update The genome of the virus identified from the patient in Texas is publicly posted in GISAID and has been submitted to GenBank. April 2, 2024 – CDC has sequenced the influenza virus genome identified in a specimen collected from the patient in Texas who was confirmed to be infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) ["HPAI A(H5N1)"] virus and compared these with HPAI A(H5N1) sequences from cattle, wild birds and poultry. The virus sequences are HA clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI A(H5N1) with each individual gene segment closely related to viruses detected in dairy cattle available from USDA testing in Texas. While minor changes were identified in the virus sequence from the patient specimen compared to the viral sequences from cattle, both cattle and human sequences maintain primarily avian genetic characteristics and for the most part lack changes that would make them better adapted to infect mammals. The genome for the human isolate had one change (PB2 E627K) that is known to be associated with viral adaptation to mammalian hosts, and which has been detected before in people and other mammals infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus and other avian influenza subtypes (e.g., H7N9), but with no evidence of onward spread among people. Viruses can undergo changes in a host as they replicate after infection. Further, there are no markers known to be associated with influenza antiviral resistance found in the virus sequences from the patient's specimen and the virus is very closely related to two existing HPAI A(H5N1) candidate vaccine viruses that are already available to manufacturers, and which could be used to make vaccine if needed. Overall, the genetic analysis of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses in Texas supports CDC's conclusion that the human health risk currently remains low. More details are available in this technical summary below: Technical Summary Viral RNA extractions obtained from nasopharyngeal swab and conjunctival swab specimens collected from the patient were used as template to perform next generation sequencing using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms. Codon complete consensus sequence was successfully generated only from the conjunctival specimen and was assembled using CDC's Iterative Refinement Meta Assembler (IRMA). Illumina and ONT yielded identical sequences at the consensus sequence level. In concordance with the rRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained from each specimen (i.e., approximately 18 for the conjunctival specimen and 33 for the nasopharyngeal sample), viral RNA from the nasopharyngeal sample failed to generate PCR amplicons suitable for sequencing. Notably, the patient reported only conjunctivitis with no respiratory or other symptoms, which likely resulted in lower viral RNA concentrations detected in the nasopharyngeal sample and is suggestive of a lack of respiratory infection in the patient. The virus sequence was confirmed to be HA clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI A(H5N1) with each individual gene segment determined to be closely related to viruses detected in dairy cattle in Texas. The genotype was classified as B3.131 and corresponds to the same genotype described by USDA for the virus detected in Texas cattle2. This genotype contains PA, HA, NA and M gene segments from Eurasian wild bird lineages and PB2, PB1, NP and NS gene segments from American wild bird lineages. Other viruses with this genotype have been sporadically detected in wild birds, poultry and one skunk since November 2023 in the U.S. CDC's real-time RT-PCR diagnostic test used for the detection of A(H5) virus in human samples has not been impacted by genetic changes in B3.13 genotype viruses. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene codes for one of the two surface glycoproteins and is central to species specificity because it is responsible for virus attachment and fusion with host cells. Like the viruses detected in cattle, the analysis of the HA gene from the human specimen shows that it is closely related to HPAI A(H5) viruses in HA clade 2.3.4.4b recently detected in wild birds and poultry and lacks amino acid changes that improve recognition of mammalian receptors or fusion of the viral membrane with the host endosomal membranes. The HA is also the primary target of neutralizing antibodies elicited by infection or vaccination, and the HA of virus from the human specimen is very closely related to the A/Astrakhan/3212/2020-like pre-pandemic candidate vaccine virus (CVV) (IDCDC-RG71A) and the A/American wigeon/South Carolina/22-000345-001/2021-like CVV (IDCDC-RG78A), both of which are available to vaccine manufacturers3. There are only four amino acid changes (L104M, L115Q, T195I, V210A) between the HA1 of the virus from the Texas case and A/Astrakhan/3212/2020-like CVV and only two changes (L115Q, T195I) compared to the A/American wigeon/South Carolina/22-000345-001/2021-like CVV. The changes are not in major antigenic epitopes strongly suggesting that antibodies elicited by A/Astrakhan/3212/2020-like and A/American wigeon/South Carolina/22-000345-001/2021-like vaccines would be expected to have good cross-reactivity – and therefore protection – against this virus. The neuraminidase (NA) gene encodes the other surface protein of the virus. The major role of the NA is to release new progeny virions from an infected cell by enzymatically cleaving sialic acid receptors, which aids virus spread to uninfected cells within an infected host. The enzymatic activity of NA is inhibited by one class of antiviral drugs that are FDA-approved for treatment of influenza (i.e., NA inhibitors). Analysis of the N1 NA gene from the Texas human specimen showed that it did not have any known or suspected markers of reduced susceptibility to this class of antivirals, which includes oseltamivir. Furthermore, the NA has a full-length stalk which is consistent with viruses that naturally circulate in wild birds. In previous HPAI A(H5N1) virus outbreaks and zoonoses the NA stalk region often had deletions (e.g., a 20 amino acid deletion at positions 49–68 relative to A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996) that enhances replication and/or pathogenesis in terrestrial poultry and mice456. Analysis of the other gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, NS) was also conducted. No known or suspected markers of reduced susceptibility to antiviral compounds that target the PA (i.e., baloxavir marboxil) or M2 (i.e., amantadine, rimantadine) were found. In addition to the HA and NA, the RNA transcription and replication complex (PB2, PB1, PA, NP) also have species-specific determinants that impact efficient replication in humans and other mammals, particularly polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2). The PB1, PA and NP lacked markers of mammalian adaptation. The PB2 of the human specimen had a change of PB2 E627K compared to the PB2 genes of viruses available from USDA detections in Texas dairy cattle and typically found in A(H5N1) viruses circulating in wild birds. This mutation is, however, commonly found in humans and other mammals that are infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses and is understood to be associated with mammalian adaptation because it improves RNA polymerase activity and replication efficiency in mammalian cells; based on experimental studies in mice, guinea pigs and ferrets, it has the potential to impact pathogenesis or transmission in infected mammals78. Despite previous identification of PB2 E627K in human cases of HPAI A(H5N1) virus, there is no evidence of onward transmission among humans after infection with viruses containing this mutation. It is important to note that this substitution has not been seen in available PB2 genes from viruses circulating in wild birds and poultry or in the recently described cattle viruses detected in Texas, suggesting the mutation may have been acquired in the patient during the development of conjunctivitis. Viruses can undergo changes in a host as they replicate after infection, and it is not uncommon or surprising for HPAI A(H5N1) viruses to undergo this and other polymerase gene changes in infected patients9. Additional data from A(H5N1) virus-infected animals from the premises where the person was likely exposed is needed to support this hypothesis. The protein products from the M (M1 and M2) and NS (N1 and N2) genes lacked markers associated with mammalian adaptation. Collectively, epidemiologic, and viral genomic analyses indicate that this case represents a single zoonotic event and while the HA lacked changes likely to enhance transmission to mammals, it did acquire substitutions in PB2 likely to enhance replication in mammals, which illustrates that we have to remain vigilant and continue to characterize zoonotic viruses. Overall, the genomic analysis of the virus from this human case does not change CDC's risk assessment related to the HPAI A(H5) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. The overall risk to human health associated with the ongoing HPAI A(H5) outbreaks in poultry and detections in wild birds and cattle remains low. Note: HPAI A(H5) viruses, predominantly HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, have been circulating globally in wild birds in the U.S. since late 2021. These viruses have caused outbreaks in commercial and backyard poultry, with spillover resulting in sporadic infections in mammals.

Internal MedicineApril 1, 2024 Q&A: What you need to know about bird flu in humansBy Liam Connolly Infectious diseases expert weighs in on second human case of bird flu in the U.S. (SACRAMENTO) A person in Texas is being treated for avian influenza (bird flu), according to a report from state officials. The deadly virus has sickened dairy cows in five states in recent weeks. This marks the first known instance globally of a person catching the H5N1 strain of bird flu from a mammal and just the second human case of the illness in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). An individual who had contact with infected poultry caught the virus in 2022. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Health, answers questions about what you need to know about bird flu. What is bird flu? Bird flu is caused by influenza strains that commonly infect wild birds worldwide. They can also cause outbreaks among commercial or backyard poultry, and less commonly other animals. What are the symptoms of bird flu? Bird flu may cause birds to have respiratory symptoms such as a runny nose and coughing or sneezing, diarrhea, less energy, decreased egg production, or sometimes sudden death. In humans, bird flu may cause illnesses similar to influenza (the flu) with fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose and muscle aches. Less commonly, humans may have diarrhea and vomiting, and more rarely, seizures. How is bird flu typically spread? Most infections occur when humans have contact with sick or dead infected animals without wearing personal protective equipment. How can cows get bird flu? Many different bird species may be infected with bird flu, and the infectious virus is shed in their saliva, mucous and feces. The shed infectious virus may then infect other animals, including cows. Is bird flu contagious person-to-person? Bird flu rarely spreads person-to-person. It is more commonly spread from animal to human. There has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human spread. Is it possible that bird flu has evolved in ways that would help it spread more easily among humans? There is no evidence bird flu is currently more easily spread human-to-human, although there is always a chance the virus may evolve to more easily transmit among humans. Most human infections with bird flu can be traced to unprotected close contact with ill or dead animals. Should people avoid eating beef or ingesting dairy products? Sick or ill animals should be culled, and their animal products should not be sold. Pasteurization will kill infectious virus in contaminated milk. There may be a risk of transmission if unpasteurized milk from an ill animal is ingested. How is bird flu treated in humans? Bird flu is treated similarly to influenza in humans. The antiviral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) remains an effective option to treat humans infected with bird flu. How can people protect themselves to prevent bird flu? Avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals. This includes birds, poultry or other animals. For those who work with animals, full personal protective equipment should be used when in close or direct contact with animals or material that is potentially contaminated with the virus. This includes an N95 mask or equivalent, goggles, gloves, gown, head cover and boot covers.

And here in Virginia. state agencies are monitoring an increase in cases among wild birds in the eastern part of the state.They stress the risk of transmission to people is low. And the food supply, including meat and milk, remains safe. But they are urging precautions, especially for Virginia’s poultry industry.For poultry farms in particular, the spread of avian influenza can be devastating.“From a poultry standpoint, this disease is hugely concerning and crippling to the industry. Really from the bird standpoint there is no cure for it, so it results in depopulation and that’s our attempt to control the disease,” said Mike Persia, Virginia Tech Professor of Animal and Poultry Sciences.The latest reports do not include any commercial flocks here in Virginia, but state agencies are urging poultry farmers and others with backyard birds to take precautions.“The virus is severe and does have potential ramifications for the poultry industry, so it’s important for those that work with poultry or have poultry at home to take proper, strict biosecurity measures to protect those flocks,” said Dr. John Tracey, State Wildlife Veterinarian with the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources.And what about the possibility of a widespread outbreak among people? Experts say the risk is there, but it’s low.“I think the fact that this H5N1 virus is in wild bird populations is not optimal, but I think that this is probably a recognition of risks that have existed for a long time from different viruses throughout human history,” said Dr. Patrick Jackson, an infectious disease expert with UVA Health. “So I think it’s good that we have this awareness and we can do this monitoring, but I don’t think that necessarily means that our risk of a human epidemic happening right now is necessarily elevated.”We received an advisory on the cases involving wild birds in eastern Virginia from three different agencies involved with Virginia wildlife, public health and agriculture. Jackson says that’s a good thing, because it shows the state is taking a coordinated approach to monitoring this problem.Copyright 2024 WDBJ.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture says cows in multiple states have tested positive for bird flu. Rodrigo Abd/AP hide caption toggle caption Rodrigo Abd/AP Dairy cattle feed at a farm on March 31, 2017, near Vado, N.M. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says cows in multiple states have tested positive for bird flu. Rodrigo Abd/AP Livestock at multiple dairy farms across the U.S. have tested positive for bird flu — also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI — in an outbreak that's likely spread to at least five states. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed Friday that cows in Texas, Kansas and Michigan had been sickened by the virus, and there were presumptive positive test results for additional herds in New Mexico and Idaho. It's the first time the disease has been found in dairy cattle, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. Sponsor Message On Monday, the Texas Department of State Health Services announced that a person who was exposed to dairy cattle presumed to be infected with bird flu had also caught the virus. National What we know about the deadliest U.S. bird flu outbreak in 7 years It is only the second time a human in the U.S. has contracted HPAI A, or H5N1, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A person in contact with infected poultry was sickened in Colorado in 2022. Texas issued a public health alert Monday, asking health care providers in the state to be on the lookout for people with symptoms of bird flu who may have been exposed to an infected person or animal. The new cases come just days after a group of young goats contracted bird flu on a Minnesota farm. Bird flu infects the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of birds and is often fatal to avian populations. It can spread from wild birds to commercial poultry and backyard flocks as well as terrestrial and marine mammals and humans. Government officials say the risk to the public amid the current outbreak remains low. Most past human infections have occurred after people had "unprotected exposures to sick or dead infected poultry," according to the CDC, and it's rare for a human to transmit the disease to another person. Sponsor Message Officials say the strain of the virus detected in Michigan is similar to the one found in Texas and Kansas, which was shown through initial testing not to include any changes that would make it more transmissible to humans. Health The first human case of avian flu in the U.S. is reported in Colorado The rash of bird flu infections should also not dramatically impact consumers of dairy products, federal and state officials say. "The good news is this is not a serious problem," Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller told NPR on Sunday. "It's not going to bankrupt anybody. Cows basically have the flu for a week, and they get over it." Officials say the dairy supply is safe The country's commercial dairy supply is safe and a milk recall is unnecessary, the USDA says. That's because dairies are required to divert or destroy any milk from impacted livestock, and only milk from healthy cows can be processed for human consumption. Additionally, pasteurization — which is required for milk entering interstate commerce — kills bacteria and viruses, including influenza. Shots - Health News Eggs prices drop, but the threat from avian flu isn't over yet The Food and Drug Administration says there is limited information available about the transmission of bird flu in raw, unpasteurized milk. The agency has long warned people to avoid raw milk, which it says can harbor dangerous bacteria and sicken consumers. Federal officials say the loss of milk from ill dairy cows is too limited to significantly impact the commercial supply, which is typically higher in the spring due to increased seasonal production. Dairy prices are not expected to rise due to the outbreak, they added. How regulators and farmers are working to contain the spread The USDA believes the dairy cows have been sickened by a strain called H5N1, Eurasian lineage goose/Guangdong clade 2.3.4.4b, which was likely introduced by wild birds. Pigeons, blackbirds and grackles were identified at the affected Texas farms. But federal officials are also not ruling out the possibility of cow-to-cow transmission. That's after a Michigan farm recently received a shipment of cattle from an affected Texas farm before any of the cows show signs of disease, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said Friday. Africa South Africa culls millions of chickens in an effort to contain bird flu outbreaks While there are still many unknowns, the available evidence collected from infected cattle isn't alarming to Richard Webby, a virologist from Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. "There's nothing in the sequence of the virus that sort of immediately screams that it has changed, and that's why these cows are getting infected," he said. "It just seems to be fairly typical of the viruses that have been detected in birds in various regions." Cows sickened by bird flu at affected dairy farms have recovered "after isolation with little to no associated mortality reported," according to the USDA. Sponsor Message Texas officials said Monday that the person who tested positive for bird flu had reported eye inflammation, or conjunctivitis, as their only symptom. They were told to isolate and were being treated with oseltamivir, an antiviral drug. Federal and state agencies are continuing to test sick livestock and unpasteurized milk samples. The USDA also recommends that farmers and their veterinarians practice "good biosecurity," which includes limiting animal movements, testing livestock before they're moved and isolating sick cows.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently reported detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in U.S. dairy cattle in multiple states. This Health Advisory also includes a summary of interim CDC recommendations for preventing, monitoring, and conducting public health investigations of potential human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) virus. Background A farm worker on a commercial dairy farm in Texas developed conjunctivitis on approximately March 27, 2024, and subsequently tested positive for HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection. HPAI A(H5N1) viruses have been reported in the area’s dairy cattle and wild birds. There have been no previous reports of the spread of HPAI viruses from cows to humans. The patient reported conjunctivitis with no other symptoms, was not hospitalized, and is recovering. The patient was recommended to isolate and received antiviral treatment with oseltamivir. Illness has not been identified in the patient’s household members, who received oseltamivir for post-exposure prophylaxis per CDC Recommendations for Influenza Antiviral Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis. No additional cases of human infection with HPAI A(H5N1) virus associated with the current infections in dairy cattle and birds in the United States, and no human-to-human transmission of HPAI A(H5N1) virus have been identified. CDC has sequenced the influenza virus genome identified in a specimen collected from the patient and compared it with HPAI A(H5N1) sequences from cattle, wild birds, and poultry. While minor changes were identified in the virus sequence from the patient specimen compared to the viral sequences from cattle, both cattle and human sequences lack changes that would make them better adapted to infect mammals. In addition, there were no markers known to be associated with influenza antiviral drug resistance found in the virus sequences from the patient’s specimen, and the virus is closely related to two existing HPAI A(H5N1) candidate vaccine viruses that are already available to manufacturers, and which could be used to make vaccine if needed. This patient is the second person to test positive for HPAI A(H5N1) virus in the United States. The first case was reported in April 2022 in Colorado in a person who had contact with poultry that was presumed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus. Currently, HPAI A(H5N1) viruses are circulating among wild birds in the United States, with associated outbreaks among poultry and backyard flocks and sporadic infections in mammals. The current risk these viruses pose to the public remains low. However, people with job-related or recreational exposures to infected birds, cattle, or other animals are at higher risk of infection and should take appropriate precautions outlined in CDC Recommendations for Farmers; Poultry, Backyard Bird Flock, and Livestock Owners; and Worker Protection. CDC continues to work with USDA, FDA, and state health departments to monitor people exposed to animals infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. The FDA does not currently have concerns about the safety or availability of pasteurized milk products nationwide. Pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza viruses, in milk and is required for any milk entering interstate commerce. Because influenza viruses constantly change, continued surveillance and preparedness efforts are critical. CDC is taking measures in case the public health risk assessment changes. This is a developing situation, and CDC will share additional updates as new relevant information becomes available. No case of severe illness or death with HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection has been reported in the United States. Since 1997, more than 900 sporadic human cases of HPAI A(H5N1) have been reported in 23 countries, with more than half of these cases resulting in death. However, since 2015–2016, human cases have decreased substantially, and only a small number of sporadic human cases have been reported worldwide since 2022. Clinical illness with HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection has ranged from mild disease (e.g., conjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms) to severe or critical disease (e.g., pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and sepsis) and death. Recommendations CDC’s updated recommendations include instructions for infection prevention and control measures, using personal protective equipment (PPE), testing, antiviral treatment, patient investigations, monitoring of exposed persons (including persons exposed to sick or dead wild and domesticated animals and livestock with suspected or confirmed infection with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses), and antiviral chemoprophylaxis of exposed persons. Recommendations for Clinicians Clinicians should consider the possibility of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection in people showing signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness or conjunctivitis and who have relevant exposure history outlined in Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus in Animals: Interim Recommendations for Prevention, Monitoring, and Public Health Investigations. Examples of symptoms include but are not limited to: Mild illness: (e.g., cough, sore throat, eye redness or eye discharge such as conjunctivitis, fever or feeling feverish, rhinorrhea, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and headache) Moderate to severe illness: (e.g., shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, altered mental status, and seizures) Complications: (e.g., pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure (respiratory and kidney failure), sepsis, and meningoencephalitis) If signs and symptoms compatible with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection are present: Isolate patient and follow infection control recommendations, including using PPE. Initiate empiric antiviral treatment as soon as possible. Do not delay treatment while awaiting laboratory results. Notify state and local health department to arrange testing for influenza A(H5N1) virus. Collect respiratory specimens from the patient to test for influenza A(H5N1) virus at the state health department. If the exposed person has conjunctivitis, with or without respiratory symptoms, both a conjunctival swab and a nasopharyngeal swab should be collected for testing. Encourage patients to isolate at home away from their household members and not go to work or school until it is determined they do not have avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. Starting empiric antiviral treatment with oral or enterically administered oseltamivir (twice daily for five days) is recommended regardless of time since onset of symptoms. Antiviral treatment should not be delayed while waiting for laboratory test results. Recommendations for State Health Departments State health department officials should investigate potential human cases of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection as described in these recommendations and notify CDC within 24 hours of identifying a case under investigation. Patients who meet epidemiologic criteria AND either clinical OR public health response criteria should be tested for influenza A(H5N1) virus infection by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using H5-specific primers and probes at state or local public health departments. Recommendations for monitoring and antiviral chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of infected persons are different than those that apply to persons who meet bird or other animal exposure criteria. Post-exposure prophylaxis of close contacts of a person with HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection is recommended with oseltamivir twice daily (treatment dosing) instead of the once daily pre-exposure prophylaxis dosing. People exposed to HPAI A(H5N1) virus-infected birds or other animals (including people wearing recommended PPE) should be monitored for signs and symptoms of acute respiratory illness beginning after their first exposure and for 10 days after their last exposure. Whenever possible, public health officials (including the state public health veterinarian) and animal health and agriculture officials (including the state veterinarian) should collaborate using a One Health approach to conduct epidemiological investigations into animal and human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) virus to protect animal and human health. Recommendations for Farmers; Poultry, Backyard Bird Flock, and Livestock Owners; and Worker Protection To reduce the risk of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection, poultry farmers and poultry workers, backyard bird flock owners, livestock farmers and workers, veterinarians and veterinary staff, and responders should wear recommended PPE (e.g., the same PPE is recommended for persons exposed to any confirmed or potentially infected animals as for exposed poultry workers; for specific recommendations see: PPE recommended for poultry workers). This includes wearing an N95™ filtering facepiece respirator, eye protection, and gloves and performing thorough hand washing after contact, when in direct physical contact, or during close exposure to sick or dead birds or other animals, carcasses, feces, unpasteurized (raw) milk, or litter from sick birds or other animals confirmed to be or potentially infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. Workers should receive training on using PPE and demonstrate an understanding of when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, how to correctly put on, use, take off, dispose of, and maintain PPE, and PPE limitations. Recommendations for the Public People should avoid being near sick or dead animals or surfaces contaminated with the animal’s feces, litter, raw milk, or other byproducts when not wearing respiratory or eye protection. Animals in which HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection has been identified include wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including livestock such as cattle and goats). As always, people should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or related uncooked food products, such as unpasteurized (raw) milk or raw cheeses, from animals with suspected or confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection.

Rogelio V. Solis/AP hide caption toggle caption Rogelio V. Solis/AP Cases of eggs from Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., await to be handed out by the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce employees at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds in Jackson, Miss., on Aug. 7, 2020. Rogelio V. Solis/AP Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., the largest producer of fresh eggs in the U.S., has temporarily halted production at one of its facilities in Texas after detecting bird flu there, the company announced Tuesday. The company says it "depopulated" about 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets, or about 3.6% of its flock, as a result of the outbreak. Bird flu — also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI — is a highly contagious virus typically spread by wild birds that is extremely deadly to avian populations. Human infections are rare. Commercial farms sometimes euthanize part of their flock during bird flu outbreaks to limit the spread of the disease, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Sponsor Message Science A person in Texas caught bird flu after exposure to cows that were thought to be ill Mississippi-based Cal-Maine Foods said it was "working to secure production from other facilities to minimize disruption to its customers." But it's possible that the depopulation at the Texas location could lead to higher egg prices at the grocery store, says Amy Hagerman, an associate professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University. "Any time you have an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a large poultry producer like this, it has the potential to impact the market, because you're taking a large number of egg-laying birds out of production all at once," Hagerman says. The illnesses at Cal-Maine Foods come amid an outbreak of bird flu among livestock at multiple dairy farms across the U.S. Food Mung bean omelet, anyone? Sky high egg prices crack open market for alternatives The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed Tuesday that it had detected bird flu in dairy herds in Texas, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Idaho. Also, the Texas Department of State Health Services announced earlier this week that a person contracted bird flu through an outbreak of the disease among dairy cattle. It was only the second time in the U.S. a person was confirmed to have HPAI A, also known as H5N1. Though the cattle appear to be experiencing only mild illnesses, bird flu is very deadly to avian populations, and poultry producers may depopulate large groups to prevent the disease from spreading. Sponsor Message Hagerman says the poultry industry tries to move quickly when an outbreak occurs, attempting to eradicate the virus from barns before bringing in new, healthy birds. Business Sky-high egg prices are finally coming back down to earth "But at least temporarily, you see that sharp decline in the total eggs laid and as a result you see a price increase usually at the grocery store," she says. How much of an increase would depend on how many flocks contract bird flu at the same time and how many birds are taken out of production, Hagerman adds. She also says the outbreak could lead to fewer cartons for sale and render some food items that contain eggs temporarily unavailable, but emphasized that she believed, "We're not going back to no-eggs-on-the-shelf levels of restricted supply." The CDC says the likelihood of someone getting bird flu by eating contaminated eggs is very low, and that a person cannot contract it from eggs that are cooked and stored properly. Officials say the rapid onset of symptoms in sick birds, combined with federal surveillance programs and other testing of poultry, make it unlikely that eggs from an infected bird enter the human food supply.

News First human case of novel avian influenza A(H5N1) in Texas First human case of novel avian influenza A(H5N1) in Texas Written By: Vicki Powers, UT Physicians | Updated: April 3, 2024 The health department reported its first case of H5N1 in Texas, likely tied to cattle with the virus. News announcing the first human case of novel avian influenza A(H5N1) in Texas emerged Monday, April 1, as an urgent warning. It wasn’t an April Fools’ Day joke. Luis Z. Ostrosky, MD “People don’t need to panic. This is not a pandemic right now,” said Luis Z. Ostrosky, MD, infectious disease expert at UT Physicians Infectious Diseases – Texas Medical Center. “This is just one of the first human cases in the United States.” The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) reported its first case of H5N1 in Texas. The patient fell ill after contact with dairy cows believed to have H5N1. The primary symptom was conjunctivitis (pink eye), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the first time that avian influenza A(H5N1) has been detected in cattle in the United States. Emerging strain “Unfortunately for this strain, it was not a question of if, but when,” said Ostrosky, professor and vice chair for health care quality at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston. He said it’s part of the natural history of strains that appear in the wild and slowly make their way into human populations. Experts proactively follow these strains to remain vigilant. “We’ve been monitoring very closely the growth of H5N1, which is a strain in avian populations – how it made it from the wild to commercial flocks, to wild mammals like seals, and to cattle,” Ostrosky said. “And now from cattle, it’s made the jump to humans.” Ostrosky said avian influenza A(H5N1) doesn’t appear to be particularly harsh and is not very efficient in transmission between humans. Therefore, the risk to the general public is believed to be low. In other countries, transmission has occurred rarely between household members and co-workers who are in very close contact. No concerns regarding dairy The general public also should not be concerned with consuming milk or milk products, based on this strain found in cattle. Ostrosky has zero concern about drinking pasteurized milk because pasteurization kills the organisms. He said raw milk is the concern. “We live in a time when it’s become kind of cool to drink unpasteurized milk, and there’s talk online about the benefits of raw milk,” Ostrosky said. “As infectious disease physicians, we are very concerned with this trend, because it can transmit multiple diseases from cattle to humans, including brucella, E. coli, and now flu.” Get tested For people who have contact with animals and develop flu-like symptoms (fever, fatigue, cough, sore throat, headaches), contact your physician so this is their consideration of potential diagnoses. Seek medical care and get tested. Ostrosky said there are treatments if a diagnosis is determined. The FDA has approved a vaccine for H5N1 that is not yet available to the public. Ostrosky said it’s stockpiled in case of a pandemic situation. View Providers Luis Z.

Smith Collection/GADO/Getty ImagesBird flu, also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus, was first detected in 1996 among birds in China, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One year later, an outbreak occurred in Hong Kong that resulted in 18 human cases, including 6 deaths, after the people were infected directly by birds.In late 2021, a version of the virus arrived on U.S. shores and was detected in wild birds. Since February of 2022, the virus has been causing outbreaks in commercial poultry supply – leaving over 80 million birds affected in nearly all states, according to the CDC. Nearly 10,000 wild birds have also been impacted.While the virus is most common in birds it has more recently spread to some other animal populations such as harbor seals, mountain lions, raccoons, polar bears, red foxes, as well as striped skunks, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Rarely, the virus can infect humans after interacting with an animal. Most recently, a dairy worker in Texas was presumed to be infected by sick cattle, according to the CDC. This is the second human case ever to be reported in the U.S.MORE: Colorado inmate is 1st human case of bird flu in USThere has not been any spread of the virus between people in the U.S., according to CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen. The risk to the public remains low, she added.A total of nearly 900 human cases have been identified since 2003, with about half dying from the infection, according to the World Health Organization. Almost all the human cases were linked to close contact with infected birds or contaminated environments.Colorized transmission electron micrograph of Avian influenza, H5N1 viruses (seen in gold) grown in MDCK cells (seen in green).Smith Collection/GADO/Getty Images"I want folks to know that for 20 years, the United States government has been preparing and trying to learn about avian flu," Cohen told ABC News.The sick patient out of Texas reported eye redness as their only symptom and is recovering after isolating and being treated with an antiviral drug, according to the public health agency."We have treatment that is available, things like Tamiflu. Not only do we have that in pharmacies, but we have it in stockpile, here in the country. And we have vaccine candidates that are matched to the current virus," Cohen said.She maintained that the U.S. government is closely monitoring the situation. "The fact that it spread to one human case is certainly making us want to take this very seriously. But folks should know that right now, the risk to them is very low," Cohen said."These are the things that reassure me: 20 years of preparation, no genetic changes to this virus, no human-to-human spread and nothing in the virus in terms of adaptations that would make us think it is more adaptive to human spread," she added.Recent analyses from the CDC indicate that the virus has not adapted to better infect humans.MORE: What to know about the deadliest bird flu outbreak in history"As we look more closely at the virus's genetics, it is very similar to the virus that we've seen spread in bird populations. And so, we're not seeing an important change in the virus that would increase our alarm," said Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News medical contributor.Those who work with wild animals or livestock may be at higher risk of being exposed and infected with bird flu, according to the CDC.People should avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them from a distance, according to the CDC. It is also important to avoid contact with sick or dead animals, in general. Human infections can occur when the virus gets into a person's eyes nose or mouth, or is inhaled, typically after prolonged contact."The risk really is concentrated in those that are working in close proximity to animals and birds," Brownstein said."And those are the people that we, of course, need to improve our surveillance and make sure that we identify any case as early as possible," he added.Because milk products are pasteurized, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply, according to the USDA. Other federal agencies like the FDA and CDC warn against drinking raw milk or products made from it, due to the risk of viruses and bacteria, which may lead to infection or foodborne illnesses."So far, there is no concern for food in our supply chain. There is no risk to those that are consuming dairy and meat products," Brownstein said.The USDA also remains confident that the meat supply is safe and reminds us that cooking to a safe internal temperature kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu."We feel in a good place to be able to understand this, learn more, and be prepared. But we are taking it very seriously. And so, you are seeing a mobilization of all of the government levers that we have to make sure that we are prepared," Cohen said.Popular ReadsTrump's plan for education in his second termNov 11, 4:56 PMSotomayor has no plans to resign: SourcesNov 10, 4:27 PMArrest in fatal shooting at Tuskegee UniversityNov 10, 6:35 PMMissing American tourist in Hungary killed: PoliceNov 9, 1:36 PM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsBird Flu: Can Humans Get It?

Public health officials say the overall risk to humans remains low and the patient is getting better. They aren’t recommending the destruction of the cows, which seem to recover from the infection, unlike the millions of birds that have been culled after the virus was detected among them. US officials say milk from affected cows hasn’t entered the food system, and if it did, the pasteurization process would kill pathogens such as bird flu. The strain of avian influenza affecting the cows, H5N1, has proved to be alarmingly adept at jumping continents and species. It was first discovered in 1996 in geese bred on a farm in southern China and has since spread across the globe, rampaging through captive, commercial birds and prompting governments to order their slaughter to limit the contagion. A new variant, clade 2.3.4.4b, emerged in 2020 in Europe and appears particularly adroit at spreading among birds and the mammals that prey on or scavenge them. Outbreak numbers that typically ebb and flow have been persistently elevated in recent years. Have a confidential tip for our reporters?

But after absorbing their shock, several admitted there was evidence to suggest bovine infection could happen — it just hadn’t been reported with this particular strain of influenza virus until now.advertisement The situation is evolving. But here are some questions we can answer now about the curious case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in dairy cattle. How widespread is the virus in cows? Cows from 12 dairy herds in five states have tested positive for H5N1. Those states are Texas (seven herds), Kansas (two), Michigan (one), New Mexico (one), and Idaho (one). Is that the full extent of the problem?advertisement Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Some experts believe it’s unlikely — if only because people haven’t been looking for bird flu infections in cattle before now. “It could have been infecting dairy cattle a year ago. We just never thought about looking … for it,” said David Swayne, an avian influenza expert who is now a private consultant after having worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture for nearly 30 years. Should this news have been such a shock? Probably not, Swayne admitted. In the 1990s, there were reports from the United Kingdom of cows that were infected with human flu viruses. And there is a type of influenza known as influenza D that cows are susceptible to. (Humans mainly contract influenza A and B viruses.) As to infection with H5N1 specifically, there has been evidence for a while that it could occur — at least in a laboratory setting. Scientists from the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, in Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany, reported in 2008 that they had experimentally infected six calves with an H5 virus retrieved from an infected cat. All remained healthy but all sero-converted — they developed antibodies that indicated that an infection had taken hold. STAT+ Connect: Get the scoop on H5N1 bird flu from a conversation between STAT’s Helen Branswell and Andrew Joseph. How did U.S. cows become infected? The list of species that this virus has been shown to be able to infect has grown substantially in the past couple of years, as widespread infection in wild birds has brought the virus to new parts of the globe. As early as 2003 the virus was seen to be able to infect big cats, having infected tigers and snow leopards in a zoo in Thailand. Later it was seen to infect domestic cats and small carnivorous mammals like martens and mink. More recently, infected black bears, brown bears, polar bears, raccoons, skunks, and coyotes have been found; aquatic mammals like sea lions and seals have also been infected. USDA keeps a list of animal species in which infections have been detected here. For some of these mammals, the route of infection is pretty obvious. Scavengers that feast on dead bird carcasses can become infected that way. Related: H5N1 avian flu found in Texas individual who apparently was infected by dairy cows But cows? Experts believe the more likely route of infection here is via water or grasslands contaminated with virus by infected birds. “There is massive (unprecedented) exposure of wild carnivores (feasting on sick/dead birds) and potentially also other mammals (through contaminated water and surface areas, including grasslands),” Ron Fouchier, an influenza virologist at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told STAT via email. “The infected mammals get infected upon feeding/drinking, which is an alternative route of infection of mammals.” Richard Webby, an influenza virologist who heads the WHO Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., said infected birds — and mammals — shed large amounts of H5N1 virus, increasing the risk to other species. “There is this elevated exposure,” he said. Are beef cattle also infected? There have been no reports to date of infected herds, but people should be on the lookout, Swayne suggested. Has the virus from the Texas individual been studied? Yes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a lengthy analysis of the genome of the virus from the infected person. The CDC’s conclusion: The small changes seen in the virus are similar to those seen in other instances where this H5N1 has infected people. Viruses with those changes haven’t been seen to trigger ongoing person-to-person spread. “Overall, the genomic analysis of the virus from this human case does not change CDC’s risk assessment,” the agency said. “The overall risk to human health associated with the ongoing HPAI A(H5) outbreaks in poultry and detections in wild birds and cattle remains low.” What else did the CDC’s analysis reveal? First, the CDC said the pattern of infection in the person — who only had conjunctivitis or pink eye — and the low levels of virus in the collected sample suggest the individual’s respiratory tract was not infected. Viruses that are spread by coughs and sneezes are easier to transmit than viruses that are not. Second, the virus taken from the individual was very closely related to two candidate vaccine viruses — seed strains for vaccine production — that are already available to vaccine manufacturers. That suggests if a virus like this one started spreading among people, those seed strains could be used to produce vaccines that would be protective. Third, the virus showed none of the genetic changes that are known to confer resistance to flu antiviral drugs. That means antivirals likely would be effective against this virus. Is there a risk to people from milk produced by infected cows? Yes, in theory. In practice, though, it shouldn’t be an issue. Infected cows shed virus in their milk. Farms that have detected H5N1 in their cows are supposed to destroy the milk produced by infected cows, so it should not make its way into the food chain. Even if some did, inadvertently, pasteurization would kill the viruses, the USDA says. Unpasteurized milk from affected cows would pose a risk to people. But unpasteurized milk poses multiple risks to people and public health authorities recommend against its consumption. Are dairy cows spreading the virus to other cows? That’s suspected, but it is uncertain at this point. The infected herd in Michigan had received cows recently from Texas. Why does that matter? Bird flu viruses are genetically structured to infect birds. They can occasionally spill over into mammals, but typically those infections should dead-end in those new hosts. The viruses would need to adapt to be able to transmit efficiently in the new species. Related: FDA advisory panel recommends a streamlined flu vaccine for next fall Viruses that mutate to be able to transmit in one species of mammals could find it easier to infect people. That’s why particular attention is paid when bird flu viruses are seen to infect people, or mammal species with which humans interact. An animal of particular concern is pigs. Why are pigs a big worry? Pigs are traditionally referred to as “mixing bowls” or “mixing vessels” for flu species, because they can be infected with bird flu viruses and with the flu viruses that infect people. If pigs become co-infected with various types of flu, the viruses can swap genes and form hybrids that can then spread from pigs to people. The 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic was caused by a virus that jumped from pigs to people. Are pigs susceptible to H5N1? Swayne said back in the early 2000s there were occasional reports from Asia of pigs being infected with the virus, but those events appeared to die out. Pigs are not among the list of mammals that have more recently been seen to be susceptible to the virus. However, scientists have tried infecting pigs in laboratories, with differing results. German scientists reported in 2023 that only one of eight pigs they infected with a strain of H5N1 from a chicken developed antibodies that indicated there had been an infection. Those scientists used the same strain of H5N1 as was found to have infected the cows in the U.S., which goes by the awkward moniker 2.3.4.4b. But more recently, scientists from the USDA reported that they were able to experimentally infect pigs, and some of the infected pigs transmitted the virus to uninoculated pigs housed with them, when using sample viruses taken from mammals — raccoons and red foxes. Is this picture likely to change? Almost undoubtedly. “We’re doing science here. And science changes. And when the science changes, then our assessment may change,” said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This article has been updated to include findings from the CDC analysis of the virus that infected the Texas person, and that testing confirmed a cattle outbreak in Idaho.

Due to immune pressure, A/H3N2 influenza viruses have emerged with altered receptor specificities that bind α2,6-linked sialosides presented on extended N-acetyl-lactosamine (LacNAc) chains. Here, binding modes of such drifted hemagglutinin’s (HAs) are examined by chemoenzymatic synthesis of N-glycans having 13C-labeled monosaccharides at strategic positions. The labeled glycans are employed in 2D STD-1H by 13C-HSQC NMR experiments to pinpoint which monosaccharides of the extended LacNAc chain engage with evolutionarily distinct HAs. The NMR data in combination with computation and mutagenesis demonstrate that mutations distal to the receptor binding domain of recent HAs create an extended binding site that accommodates with the extended LacNAc chain. A fluorine containing sialoside is used as NMR probe to derive relative binding affinities and confirms the contribution of the extended LacNAc chain for binding.

These viruses became seasonal strains that evade neutralization induced by prior infections or immunization. Seasonal IAV causes significant disease burden, infecting 9–35 million individuals annually and causing 12–56 thousand deaths2.IAV expresses hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) as two major envelope glycoproteins. HA binds to sialic acid (Neu5Ac) of glycoconjugates on host cells to initiate infection, whereas NA facilitates the release of progeny viruses from infected cells by cleaving sialosides3. Human IAVs recognize sialosides α2,6-linked to galactoside (Gal), which are structures that are abundantly found in the upper respiratory tract of humans. On the other hand, HAs of ancestorial avian viruses exhibit a preference for α2,3-linked sialosides that are found in the duck enteric and chicken upper respiratory tract4,5,6,7,8.Human IAVs have a remarkable ability to evolve and evade neutralization by antibodies elicited by prior infections or vaccination. This antigenic drift is mainly caused by mutations in the receptor binding site at the globular head of HA8,9,10. A/H3N2 viruses, which are the leading cause of severe seasonal influenza illness11 resulted in altered glycan binding properties. These changes were first noticed by a lack of agglutination of fowl red blood cells. Furthermore, these viruses also propagate poorly in common laboratory hosts such as MDCK cells and eggs, indicating they require glycan receptors that are not expressed by these cells or hosts12,13,14. Glycan microarray and other binding studies have indicated that these viruses have lost the ability to bind to simple α2,6-linked sialoglycans15 and instead bind to bi-antennary N-glycans that have on both arms extended N-acetyl lactosamine (LacNAc) moieties terminating in an α2,6-linked sialoside. Computational studies indicated a binding mode in which the two sialosides of the bi-antennary N-glycan bridge the binding sites of a trimeric HA protein resulting in high avidity of binding15.We have constructed a glycan microarray populated with bi-antennary N-glycans that more closely resemble structures expressed by human respiratory tissue16. It includes N-glycans having multiple consecutive LacNAc repeating units that can be capped by sialic acid. Glycomic analysis has shown that these structures are abundantly expressed by a human epithelial cell line16 and respiratory tissues17,18 and are expected to be relevant receptors for IAVs. Compound 1 (Fig. 1) was established as the minimal epitope for early A/H3N2 viruses, whereas those that emerged after 2000 (e.g., NL2003) did not bind to 1 and required as minimal epitope a compound such as 2 with one of its arms presenting a tri-LacNAc moiety having a terminal α2,6-linked sialoside19. Microarray data combined with sequence alignment, reported crystal structures, and MD simulations indicated an alternative binding model for recent A/H3N2 of the 3 C.2 clade in which mutations remote from the receptor binding domain resulted in a rotation of the side chain of Tyr159, creating an extended binding site16. Furthermore, a 225 G/D mutation reoriented the poly-LacNAc chain of the compound allowing it to establish interactions with this extended binding site.Fig. 1: Synthesized sialoglycans.Isotopically glycans for NMR studies with evolutionary distinct HAs.Full size imageIn this work, we describe the chemoenzymatic synthesis of N-glycan 2 and the 13C-labeled analogs 3, 4, and 5 that differ in the positions of 13C-labeled monosaccharides along the poly-LacNAc chain. The 13C-labeled glycans are employed in 2D saturation transfer difference (STD)-1H,13C-HSQC experiments to pinpoint those monosaccharides of the poly-LacNAc chain of 2 that engage with HAs from evolutionarily distinct A/H3N2. The NMR data in combination with in silico and mutagenesis studies demonstrate that mutations distal to the receptor binding domain of HA create an extended binding site that can directly interact with the extended LacNAc chain of glycans. To investigate whether the affinity of HAs of contemporary A/H3N2 strains for the extended glycans has improved or compensated due to mutations at the receptor binding site, we employ a fluorine-containing sialyl-LacNAc derivative (19F-SLN, compound 6 in Fig. 1) as a 19F NMR probe to derive relative binding affinities. This demonstrates that the additional contributions of the LacNAc chain improve binding affinity only for recent A/H3N2 strains.The preparation of isotopomers 3–5 is critical for the STD NMR experiments and uncover the contributions of each monosaccharide of the tri-LacNAc chain of 2 for binding to various HAs. This type of NMR experiment is a powerful approach to characterize glycans interactions with proteins at the atomic level20. Ligand protons in close proximity to the protein receive saturation resulting in strong STD signals. On the other hand, ligand protons that are more remote or do not engage with the protein exhibit weak or no STD signals. Large glycans suffer, however, from very low chemical shift dispersion of their 1H NMR signals precluding detailed binding studies by 1H-STD NMR. This is especially problematic when glycans present repeating units, such as poly-LacNAc chains, as these have almost indistinguishable 1H chemical shifts. These difficulties can be alleviated by using 13C isotope labels introduced at specific positions of an oligosaccharide chain. 13C-filtered NMR spectra are then specific for these site-selective probes and free of background signals from unlabeled monosaccharides within the N-glycan or from the HA glycoprotein. Such isotope labeling preserves binding characteristics while allowing heteronuclear NMR studies with atomic resolution and substantially increased sensitivity21,22. A challenge that we address in this study is the preparation of high-complex glycan having selectively 13C labeled monosaccharides.ResultsSynthesis of asymmetrical 13C labeled N-glycansGlycan 2 and the three asymmetric isotopomers 3-5 (Fig. 1) were prepared from glycosyl asparagine 8 that could readily be prepared from a sialoglycopeptide extracted from egg-yolk powder followed by pronase treatment and then acid-mediated hydrolysis of the sialosides (Fig. 2a)23. UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Gal having 13C-isotopes at carbons 1 to 6 in combination with appropriate glycosyl transferases were employed to introduce 13C-labeled GlcNAc and Gal moieties into the target oligosaccharides. To selectively extend the α(1,3)-Man arm of 8 by an oligo-LacNAc chain, we exploited the inherent branch selectivity of β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6Gal1), which has a 10-fold higher activity for the α3-arm24, allowing for the convenient preparation of 9. Next, the remaining terminal galactoside at the α6-arm of 9 was temporarily modified by an α1,2-fucoside by treatment with α1,2-fucosyltransferase 1 (FuT1) in the presence of GDP-Fuc to give 10. The α1,2-fucoside temporarily blocks the α6-arm from modifications by mammalian glycosyl transferases25, and thus after removal of the α2,6-sialoside of 10 by acid-mediated hydrolysis, the α3-arm of the resulting 11 could be selectively elaborated into a tri-LacNAc chain by the sequential use of B3GnT2 and B4GalT1 in combination with UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Gal, respectively. The use of the 13C-labeled sugar donors for the installation of the first or second LacNAc moiety gave access to compounds 15 and 20 having the terminal and central LacNAc moiety labeled by 13C-isotopes, respectively (Fig. 2b, c). Target glycans 3 and 4 were obtained by treatment 15 and 20 with ST6Gal1 in the presence of CMP-Neu5Ac to give 16 and 21 that were treated with an α1,2-fucosidase to provide target compounds 3 and 4.Fig. 2: Chemoenzymatic synthesis of 13C labeled sialoglycans 3 and 4.a The α(1,3)-arm of glycan 8, which was selectively modified as α2,6-linked sialoside allowing selectively fucosylation of the α(1,6)-arm which temporarily block it glycosyl accepting properties (stop). After acid hydrolysis of the 2,6-linked sialoside, compound 11 was obtained that allows selective extension of the α(1,3)-arm. b Glycan 3 was prepared by employing 13C labeled UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Gal during the introduction of the final LacNAc assembly followed by treatment sialylation with ST6Gal1 and removal of the fucoside using a 1,2-fucosidase. c Glycan 4 was prepared by using 13C labeled UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Gal during the introduction of the central LacNAc moiety.Full size imageTo introduce the 13C labeled galactoside in the inner LacNAc moiety, symmetrical N-glycan 8 was treated with galactosyl hydrolase from E. coli that has high preference for the α3-arm26, to give after purification by HILIC-HPLC, asymmetrical glycan 22 (Fig. 3). The terminal galactoside at the α6-arm of 22 was temporarily blocked as α2,3-linked sialoside by treatment with β-galactoside α2,3-sialyltransferase 4 (ST3Gal4) in the presence of CMP-Neu5Ac to provide 23. Next, a 13C-labeled galactoside was linked to the terminal GlcNAc moiety of 23 by employing B4GalT1 and 13C-labeled UDP-Gal to give 24. The α3-arm of the latter compound was enzymatically extended into a tri-LacNAc structure to give 28 by repeated use of B3GnT2 and B4Gal1. Treatment of 28 with ST6Gal1 in the presence of CMP-Neu5Ac installed an α2,6-sialoside thereby providing 29. Finally, the α2,3-linked sialoside at the α6-arm of 29 was selectively removed by treatment with α2,3-neuraminidase to afford target glycan 5. The same synthetic strategy was used to synthesize unlabelled 2 from unlabeled UDP-sugar donor.Fig. 3: Chemoenzymatic synthesis of glycan 5.Selective removal of the galactoside of the α3-arm allowed the selective installation of the 13C-labeled galactoside at the first residue of the tri-LacNAc moiety to give entry into the synthesis of glycan 5.Full size image1D 1H-STD NMR experimentsHAs from evolutionarily different time points, HK68 (1968), NL91 (1991), and NL03 (2003), were selected to analyze their binding preferences for unlabeled glycan 2 by 1D 1H-STD NMR experiments (Fig. 4a). HK68 is the prototypical HA of the 1968 Hong-Kong pandemic that was adapted from its avian predecessor to bind human-type receptors27. NL91 HA was isolated when these viruses could still hemagglutinate fowl erythrocytes. Later in the antigenic evolution, these viruses lost this property as was observed for in the NL03 strain.Fig. 4: NMR binding studies.a 1D 1H-STD NMR. Spectra obtained for the complexes of HK68, NL91, and NL03 HAs with the glycan 2, and inset of the acetyl region. b 19F-R2 NMR. Comparison of transverse 19F relaxation rate, R2(19F), for the fluorinated probe (6) in the absence or presence of the different HA proteins. Addition of competitor molecules 7 and 2 causes a decrease in R2(19F) proportional to their affinities relative to the probe compound 6. The bars represent the average of three replicates ± SD.Full size imageFirst, we examined the receptor binding specificities of HK68, NL91, and NL03 by glycan microarray technology. Thus, a series of N-glycans was printed on NHS-activated microarray slides which was probed by several plant lectins for quality control (Supplementary Fig. 4). Next, whole viruses of HK68, NL91, and NL03 were exposed to the glycan microarray, and binding was determined by using broadly neutralizing antibody CR8020 and an Alexa labeled goat-anti-human antibody (Supplementary Fig. 4). HK68 displays some residual avian-type receptor binding specificity and bound 2,3- as well as 2,6-sialosides. NL91 only bound human-type receptors including compound 1 and 2 that display the 2,6-linked sialoside at a mono- and tri-LacNAc moiety, respectively. The further evolved NL03 only bound compound 2. This virus prefers the sialoside at the extended LacNAc moiety to be displayed at the α3-mannose antenna as the isomeric compound did not show binding. Mono- and di-sialylated structures gave similar responsiveness indicating that bidentate binding is not important for recognition. Control compounds lacking sialic acid did not bind.Next, STD experiments were performed using compound 2 and recombinant HAs from HK68, NL91, and NL03. The STD signals confirmed that all three HAs have functional binding properties. As expected, severe 1H chemical shift overlap limited 1H-STD-based analysis that nonetheless revealed clear differences. Thus, HA from HK68 showed STD signals only for the sialic acid moiety, indicating that only this residue contributes to protein binding. The strongest STD signals were observed for H4, H7, H8, H9, and the methyl group of the acetamide moiety of the sialoside. In contrast, the 1H-STD spectrum of NL91 HA showed several additional STD signals, including the methyl group of an acetamide of a GlcNAc residue. Finally, the 1H-STD spectrum of NL03 HA was substantially more complex and showed, among others, STD signals above 4 ppm that correspond to the H1 and H4 of galactosides. It was, however, not possible to identify specific monosaccharides due to the chemical shift degeneration of the nuclei of the tri-LacNAc chain. These results indicate that from 1968 to 2003, A/H3N2 HAs evolved to recognize additional residues of an extended LacNAc chain beyond the terminal α2,6-sialoside.Transverse relaxation rate R2(19F) NMR experiments to establish relative binding affinitiesTo identify the minimal binding epitope and derive relative binding affinities for the three HAs, we used fluorine-containing Neu5DFA(α2,6)LacNAc (19F-SLN, compound 6, Fig. 1) as probe (see supplementary section 2 for details of the synthesis of 6). The strategic incorporation of a non‐endogenous fluorine atom (19F) enables ligand-protein interaction studies by molecule-specific 19F NMR experiments monitoring R2(19F)-relaxation rates that do not suffer from overlap or dispersion problems as in 1H-based NMR experiments described above28,29. First, the overall transverse relaxation rate was measured, R2(19F), of 19F-SLN in the absence of HA. Addition of the HAs to this fluorinated probe caused a large increase in R2(19F) relative to the free form indicating 19F-SLN binding (Fig. 4b, filled bars). R2(19F) increases for NL91 and NL03 were substantially larger than for HK68. These observations indicate a substantial affinity increase for the 19F-SLN trisaccharide from HK68 to NL91 and slightly increased from NL91 to NL03 as previously also observed by ELISA assays16. Together with the results from the 1D 1H-STD NMR experiments, it is concluded that the higher affinity of NL91 and NL03 HAs for this trisaccharide is due to additional recognition of the Gal and GlcNAc residues which does not occur for HK68.As the replacement of two hydrogen atoms by fluorine at the acetamide moiety may alter ligand binding properties30, the suitability of compound 6 as a probe was examined by a competition experiment using unlabeled sialyl LacNAc 7 (Fig. 1). Thus, 1.0 equivalent of 7 was added to the NMR tube containing the three different HA proteins and 19F-SLN (6). Addition of the non-fluorinated competitor caused a small, but significant decay of R2(19F) (ca. 5%) that is consistent with similar and low affinities of compounds 6 and 7 for the three HAs (Fig. 4b, square-pattern filled bars) and confirms they bind at the same site of the HAs. The R2(19F) decay was simulated which confirmed the observations (Supplementary Section 4.3).Next, we examined the relative HA affinities for compound 2 that present an α2,6-linked sialoside on its extended tri-LacNAc chain. Thus, 0.4 equivalent of 2 was added relative to the fluorinated probe to samples containing the three different HA proteins and 19F-SLN (6), (Fig. 4b, dotted-pattern filled bars). For the HAs from HK68 and NL91, the addition of the competing glycan 2 caused a small reduction of R2(19F) similar to that induced by trisaccharide 7, indicating that the two additional LacNAc moieties in 2 do not enhance the binding affinity.On the other hand, addition of compound 2 to the HA of NL03 and 19F-SLN (6) resulted in a substantially larger reduction of R2(19F) with a decay of ca. 30%. This value is consistent with a KD that is at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of 6 (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). These results indicate that the inner di-LacNAc moiety of 2 substantially contributes to recognition by NL03 by providing additional intermolecular interactions in agreement with the 1H-STD results.1H-STD competition experiments were performed to quantify the contribution of the extended LacNAc moiety to the KD of NL03. Thus, the intensity of unique 1H-STD signal of the di-fluoro acetamide moiety of 6 was monitored as function of different concentrations of competitors 7, 8, and 9 (Fig. 1). Consistent with the 19F-NMR experiments, the mono- (7) and the di-LacNAc (8) containing sialosides bound to the protein with a KD of ∼600 μM, which is similar to that derived for the fluorinated compound 6. The KD of the tri-LacNAc containing sialoside 9 was determined to be 30 μM. These results further support that the underlying tri-LacNAc chain of 9 substantially contributes to binding of NL03, resulting in a 10-fold higher affinity compared to the mono- and di-LacNAc containing sialosides (The corresponding 1H-STD spectra are reported in Supplementary Fig. 5c).2D 1H-STD-1H,13C-HSQC experimentsTo elucidate specific contributions of each monosaccharide of the poly-LacNAc chain of 2 to HA binding, we recorded 2D 1H-STD-1H,13C-HSQC NMR experiments for isotopomers 3, 4, and 5 in the presence of the three HAs. This variant of the 1H-STD experiment covers 1H[13C]-STD effects only for protons bound to a 13C isotope and, therefore unambiguously demonstrates whether specifical 13C labeled monosaccharides contribute to recognition or not. 1H-STD-1H,13C-HSQC experiments with isotopomer 3 showed clear differences in recognition between HK68, NL91, and NL03 HA (Fig. 5a). For HK68, no 1H[13C]-STD signals were observed indicating that the terminal LacNAc unit is not part of the recognized epitope. In contrast, 1H[13C]-STD signals were observed with moderate and strong intensities for NL91 HA and NL03 HA, respectively, indicating that these HAs evolved to recognize sialic acid linked to a LacNAc moiety.Fig. 5: 2D 1H-STD-1H,13C-HSQC NMR experiments probing the interaction of compounds 3 to 5 with different HA proteins.a Off-resonance reference (left) and associated 1H-STD-1H,13C-HSQC spectra for the indicated three HA proteins in complex with compound 3. b, c Sum of all 1H[13C]-STD signals of the 13C labeled Gal (orange) and GlcNAc (cyan) moieties in compounds 4 (b) and 5 (c) in complex with the three HA proteins.Full size imageSimilar experiments with isotopomer 4, in which the central LacNAc unit is 13C-labeled uncovered further differences in recognition by the three HAs (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 7). As expected, HK68 HA did not produce any 1H[13C]-STD signal while the HA from NL91 and NL03 clearly invoked signals. The 1H[13C] STD signals are derived from both Gal and GlcNAc and were stronger for NL03 HA, where the sum of all STD signal was almost twice as those observed for NL91 HA, indicating that the central LacNAc moiety is more intimately bound by NL03. Finally, 1H-STD-1H,13C-HSQC experiments with isotopomer 5 (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 8), which has a 13C-labeled Gal farthest away from the sialoside, did not show any 1H[13C]-STD signals for HK68 HA. Thus, this most ancient viral HA recognizes the glycan exclusively through the terminal α2,6-linked sialoside. NL91 HA produced weak 1H[13C]-STD signals while NL03 HA gave rise to the strongest STD signals, where the sum of 1H[13C]-STD intensities was, again, almost twice as those observed for NL91. The most intense 1H[13C]-STD signals from 5 in complex with NL03 HA corresponded to the H3, H4 and H5 protons of the 13C labeled Gal residue (Supplementary Fig. 9). In galacto-configurated monosaccharides, these protons point in the same direction, forming a so-called alpha-face of the pyranoside rings, and often participate in CH-π interactions with aromatic amino acids receptor proteins31,32.The 2D 1H-STD-1H,13C-HSQC experiment in combination with residue-specific 13C labeling of glycan 2 made it possible to disentangle the contributions of individual monosaccharides of the extended poly-LacNAc chain for recognition by three different HAs. Increasing 1H[13C]-STD signal intensities were observed during evolution of HA indicating more intimate contacts with the poly-LacNAc chain. Thus, for the original pandemic A/H3N2 human virus (HK68) the poly-LacNAc moiety does not contribute to binding, whereas, for later strains, site-specific mutations close to its glycan binding site enable further interactions with the extended glycan chain. For the evolutionarily early NL91 HA, these interactions are mostly limited to the sialic acid-linked galactoside while the more contemporary NL03 HA recognizes almost the entire poly-LacNAc chain.Modeling of glycan-HA complexesTo uncover the binding modes of the three HAs, we combined the results from the NMR experiments with in silico modeling (Fig. 6). Full atom 1 μs molecular dynamic (MD) simulations in explicit water were performed for asymmetric N-glycan 2 in complex with the three HAs. In agreement with previous X-ray studies33, the complex of 2 with HK68 HA showed that the recognition of sialic acid is mediated by hydrophobic interactions with amino acids Y98, H183, W153, and L226, as well as by hydrogen bonding interactions with G135-N137, S228, and E190 (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Analysis of the MD trajectory showed that E190 engages the Sia-1 OH9 through hydrogen bonding with an average distance of ~2.9 Å, while L226 makes hydrophobic interactions with the sialic acid-galactose glycosidic linkage. Beyond the sialic acid residue, the MD simulation did not reveal stable intermolecular interactions and throughout the MD trajectory, the poly-LacNAc chain was flexible and mainly solvent-exposed (Supplementary Fig. 11).Fig. 6: Models of N-glycan 2 binding by different HA proteins.a Binding of 2 by HK68 HA. Only the terminal sialic acid fits into the protein binding pocket while the rest of the poly-LacNAc chain is solvent-exposed. b Binding of 2 by NL91 HA. The sialic acid and nearby parts of the α2,6-linked galactoside establish contacts with the protein. c Binding of 2 by NL03 HA. The entire poly-LacNAc chain establishes contacts with the protein. d Comparison of glycan binding modes for NL91 and NL03 HA. A change in the C5-C6 torsion angle adjacent to the Neu5Ac-Gal glycosidic linkage facilitates a reorientation of the underling glycan chain for extended interaction with NL03 HA.Full size imageThe MD simulation for NL91 HA (Supplementary Fig. 10b and 12) revealed that the S145K mutation at the sialic acid binding site enables a new hydrogen bond interaction with the OH4 of Neu5Ac. To probe the importance of this interaction, we created reverse mutations in NL03. Indeed, the K145 is essential for binding and when mutated to serine almost no response was detected when examined for binding on the glycan microarray (Supplementary Fig. 14). On the other hand, the Y137 side chain in NL91 HA is properly oriented to face the sialic acid-galactose glycosidic bond, which is consistent with the STD signals detected for H4 to H6S of this Gal residue (Fig. 5a) that were not observed for HK68 HA. We also confirmed the effect of this mutation by creating NL03 N137Y which did not significantly alter glycan binding on the array.Another relevant NL91 HA mutation is Q189R in the 190-helix where the more extended side chain of the R residue is oriented towards solvent. This leaves space for the acetamide group of the GlcNAc (GlcNAc-3) to be accommodated into a hydrophobic pocket of the protein, where its methyl group makes van der Waals contacts with L194. These results are consistent with the observed 1H-STD signal for the acetamide moiety of the GlcNAc residue in NL91 HA (Fig. 4a).The MD trajectory for NL03 HA in complex with 2 (Supplementary Figs. 10c and 13) showed that the further Y137S mutation restores a hydrogen bond with the carboxylic acid of Neu5Ac as originally observed for HK6833, while maintaining the K145 hydrogen bond to OH4 of the sialoside, as in NL91. Yet, the concomitant E190D mutation now precludes hydrogen bonding with OH9 of the sialoside due to the shorter D-side chain. The G225D mutation appears crucial to switch the glycan orientation in the receptor binding site consistent with the observed stronger 1H-STD signal for the terminal Gal in NL03 relative to NL91 HA and with previous X-ray studies34,35. The new hydrogen bonds between D225 side chain and both OH4 and OH3 in Gal forces the α2,6-sialyl-Gal glycosidic linkage in a conformation that moves the underlying glycan chain towards the HA 190-helix (Fig. 6d). In this orientation, the hydrophobic interaction between GlcNAc-3 acetamide moiety and L194 is stabilized because S193 can establish an additional hydrogen bond with Gal-4. Further mutations distal to the receptor binding site (RBS) in NL03 HA reorient the Y159 side chain to face the Gal-6 and establish CH-π interactions (Supplementary Fig. 10c). The MD results are in accordance with the NMR data showing a substantial increase in 1H-STD signal intensities for H3, H4, and H5 of the Gal-6 residue. Thus, four residues (D225, L194, S193, and Y159) in the binding pocket of NL03 HA accommodate the extended glycan chain and contribute to the strong 1H[13C]-STD signals observed for compounds 3, 4, and 5 in the presence of NL03 HA.Structural studies using additional variants and mutagenesis to confirm the binding modelsWe expanded our study by including two additional HAs having further mutations in the extended binding site. NL09 HA (2009) has K145N, Y159F, S193F, and D225N mutations that according to our models are expected to impair recognition of glycan 2. Indeed, the 2D 1H-STD-1H,13C-HSQC experiment with the three isotopomers 3, 4, and 5 showed substantially weaker 1H[13C]-STD signals than observed for NL03 HA (Fig. 7b). MD simulation revealed that N145 cannot engage the sialic acid by hydrogen bonding interaction in the way K145 does for NL03 HA (Supplementary Fig. 10c). Furthermore, the substitution of D by N at residue 225 results in a weaker hydrogen bond acceptor while the S193F mutation precludes hydrogen bond interaction with the Gal in the central LacNAc unit. Finally, the Y159F mutation produces a weaker CH-π acceptor32.Fig. 7: Glycan binding by additional HA variants.a, b Glycan binding by NL09 HA. MD derived complex structure with 2 (a), and 1H[13C]-STD intensities from the 2D 1H-STD-1H,13C-HSQC spectrum of 3–5 (b). c Comparison of 1H[13C]-STD signals of 5 in the presence of Sing16 HA and its Y159A HA mutant. The STD spectra are offset, in the vertical 13C dimension, to allow a comparison of their intensities. Note the significantly weaker STD signals for mutant Sing16 Y159A HA relative to the wild type. d 1H-STD intensities for the 13C-labeled galactoside residue in 5. e, f Model of glycan-HA interactions in Sing16 HA (e) and its Y159A HA mutant (f). The absence of an aromatic moiety in the Y159A mutant precludes the key CH-π interaction with Gal-6.Full size imageMutational reversibility has been observed in HAs34, and for example in Sing16 (2016) residues 225 and 159 reverted back to D and Y, respectively, as in NL03 HA, and residue 193 back to F, as in NL09 HA. MD simulations confirmed that the key hydrogen bond between D225 and Gal-2 has been regained (Supplementary Fig. 10e) while the bulky side chain of F193 provokes steric clashes with the glycan chain as in NL09 HA. Finally, Y159 re-established strong CH-π interactions with Gal-6. Accordingly, NMR experiments showed strong 1H[13C]-STD signals for the H3, H4, and H5 in Gal-6 as observed for NL03 HA.To further assess the key contribution of Y159 for receptor binding, we produced a mutant of the Sing16 HA variant in which this tyrosine moiety is replaced by alanine, thereby abrogating the CH-π interaction. The NMR experiments showed substantial weaker 1H[13C]-STD signals for Gal-6 (Fig. 7c, d) indicating much less intimate contacts. These results underpin that several residues cooperate in glycan binding.DiscussionHuman influenza A viruses have a remarkable ability to evolve and evade neutralization by antibodies elicited by prior infections or vaccination36,37,38,39. This antigenic drift is mainly caused by mutations of amino acid in the globular head of HA where binding occurs with sialic acid-containing receptors of host cells. As a result, receptor binding modes of IAVs usually co-evolve by orchestrated mutations of several amino acids that allow immune evasion but maintain glycan binding capabilities33. A/H3N2 viruses, which are the leading cause of severe seasonal influenza illness7, exhibit a particularly fast antigenic drift and have evolved to recognize sialosides presented on extended LacNAc moieties. Predicting influenza evolution requires an understanding, at a molecular level, how mutational changes driven by immune pressure shape glycan recognition. X-ray crystallography has provided key understandings of the recognition of sialosides by HAs14,33,39,40. Implementing such an approach for complex glycans such as 2 is, however, very difficult due to glycan flexible that results in diffuse electron densities complicating refinement of glycan structures within the receptor binding site41. NMR signals reflect population-weighted averages of component conformers and binding modes under physiological conditions42, and is recognized as a versatile technique to study glycans and glycan-receptor interactions with atomic resolution. Various experiments can be considered43,44,45,46,47 and among these STD NMR is an attractive solution-based approach that can reveal which protons of a ligand interact with a protein and in combination with computational approaches, can provide models of glycan-protein complexes48,49. The implementation of such an approach for complex glycans is, however, complicated by NMR proton degeneracy. Recently, the binding of a symmetric sialylated-di-LacNAc containing N-glycan to an H3 protein was accomplished using an unnatural lanthanide tag to break the NMR signal degeneracy50. In this study, we addressed the problem of degeneracy by chemically synthesizing complex N-glycans having at specific positions 13C labeled monosaccharides without the need to introduce an artificial probe that may interfere in binding. To obtain the targeted isotopomers, we employed an N-glycan isolated from a natural source as starting material, recombinant human glycosyltransferases, and 13C labeled sugar nucleotide donors. Arm-selective extension of one of the arms of a symmetrical N-glycan starting material was possible by exploiting inherent branch selectivities of glycosyltransferases and glycosidases combined with modifications that temporarily block one of the arms from further extension51. The use of the synthetic isotopomers in 2D 1H-STD-1H,13C-HSQC experiments made it possible to unravel the contribution of individual monosaccharides of an extended poly-LacNAc chain of an N-glycan for binding to evolutionary distinct HAs. In the case of the HA of the original pandemic A/H3N2 (HK68), only the sialoside engages with the protein and no contribution of the poly-LacNAc chain for binding was detected. For later strains, mutations close to the glycan binding site enabled interactions with the LacNAc chain. For the HA of the evolutionarily early NL91, these interactions are mostly limited to the sialic acid-linked galactoside while the more contemporary NL03 HA recognized the entire tri-LacNAc chain. The latter was confirmed by a fluorine-containing sialyl-LacNAc derivative as NMR probe that provided relative binding affinities and demonstrated additional contributions of the extended LacNAc chain for binding. The importance of an extended LacNAc moiety for binding of NL03 was also demonstrated by glycan microarray in which only a 2,6-sialoside presented at a tri-LacNAc moiety gave strong responsiveness. Thus, NMR solution-based binding studies as well as a binding assay in which glycans are immobilized on surface demonstrated the importance of the extended LacNAc moiety for binding of A/H3N2 viruses of the 3 C2 clade such as NL03. Previous studies have shown that fowl erythrocytes do not display sialosides on extended LacNAc moieties and accordingly NL03 cannot agglutinate these cells16. These viruses also propagate poorly in MDCK cells which also do not express these receptors52,53 Respiratory tissues abundantly display, however, N-glycans having extended LacNAc moieties modified by sialosides making these appropriate receptors for IAV infection. It can, however, not be excluded that a high density of low-affinity receptor may also contribute to infection19.Combination of the NMR data with molecular modeling revealed how specific residues along the extended binding site of HA synergistically operate in glycan recognition. In particular, a G225D mutation changes the glycan orientation and moves the LacNAc chain closer to the protein surface. A distal mutation to the receptor binding site in NL03 HA reorient the Y159 side chain to face the Gal-6 making it possible to establish CH-π interactions. Mutagenesis experiments confirmed the important of the Y159 side chain for interacting with the extended LacNAc chain.IAV have a remarkable ability to evolve and evade neutralization by antibodies elicited by prior infections or vaccinations. Understanding this evolution at a molecular level is important for vaccine design and the development predictive models for the evolution of IAV variants. Here we demonstrate for, the first time, that H3N2 viruses of the 3C.2 clade such as NL03 have evolved to make direct interactions with 2,6-sialoside presented on an extended LacNAc moiety resulting in a much higher affinity in binding.MethodsEnzymatic synthesisMaterials and general protocolsGlycosyltransferase were expressed as previously described (St6Gal1, Fut1, St3Gal4, B4Galt1, and B3Gnt2)54.

The open reading frames of the HAs of A/Hong-Kong/1/1968 H3 (AFG71887.1), A/Netherlands/816/1991 H3 (EPI_ISL_114608), A/Netherlands/109/2003 H3 (EPI_ISL_113016), A/Netherlands/761/2009 H3 (EPI_ISL_1107270), A/Singapore/INFH-16-0019/2016 H3 (3 C.2a) (QQY97257.1), were synthesized and codon optimized by GenScript.The trimeric HAs were expressed in HEK293T (CRL-11268) and HEK 293 S GNTI(-) (ATCC CRL-3022) cells with polyethyleneimine I (PEI) in a 1:8 ratio (µg DNA:µg PEI) for the HAs as previously described16. The transfection mix was replaced after 6 h by 293 SFM II suspension medium (Invitrogen, 11686029), supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (3.7 g/L), Primatone RL-UF (3.0 g/L, Kerry, NY, USA), glucose (2.0 g/L), glutaMAX (1%, Gibco), valproic acid (0.4 g/L) and DMSO (1.5%). Culture supernatants were harvested 5 days post-transfection and the HA0 was purified with sepharose strep-tactin beads (IBA Life Sciences, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.NMR sample preparation and analysisProteins and ligands were dissolved in a deuterated TRIS-d11 50 mM buffer pD 7.8 in D2O. Shigemi NMR tubes with a diameter of 3 mm were used. 1H-STD and 1H,13C-STD HSQC experiments were acquired with a HA proteinsconcentration of 5 μM and a ligand at 300 μM (ratio 1:60). STD experiments were acquired on a 800 MHz BRUKER AVANCE III spectrometer, equipped with a TCI cryo-probe with z-gradient coil and TopSpin 3.2.7 (BRUKER) software was employed for data acquisition and processing. The temperature was set to 293 K. The 2D STD 1H,13C-HSQC experiment was previously reported21. Briefly, the 1H,1H-STD module was implemented with saturation by a train of 4 × 90° PC9_4 shaped pulses (with 1 ms separation) during d9 = 2 s, applied at the methyl 1H peak (0.84 ppm) with the non-saturation cut-offset at 1.18 ppm (i.e. distance Δν = 0.34 ppm), resulting in a PC9_4 pulse length of 33 ms at 800 MHz field strength. Protein saturation was alternated with off-resonant irradiation (at −25 ppm) in successive scans. The STD spectrum was then constructed by simple subtraction of both 2D 1H,13C-HSQC spectra. Blank 2D STD-1H,13C-HSQC experiment of the HA glycoproteins alone and glycans 3–5 were acquired as control.19F CPMG NMR experiments were acquired on a 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Bruker selective 19F–1H decoupling (SEF) probe at 298 K, using samples containing the protein at the concentration of 10 μM, and the F-SLN 6 at 125 μM. Competitor glycans 7 and 2 were successively added to the sample. The standard CPMG Bruker pulse sequence was modified as described57. Twenty-four (24) points were acquired with total echo times from 8 to 5200 ms, with τ = 2 ms. Data were analyzed with the T1T2 relaxation module of Topspin 3.5.In silico studiesMD simulationsWhen available, starting poses of the HAs were derived from X-ray crystal structures: HK68, A/HK/1/ 1968 H3N2 influenza virus hemagglutinin in complex with 6′-SLNLN (pdb code 6TZB)33. NL03, A/Wy/3/03 influenza virus hemagglutinin in complex with 6′- SLN (pdb code 6BKR)34. The starting poses of NL91, NL09, Sing16, and Sing16 (Y159A), were generated by superimposition of the model-derived structure [http:// 3dflu.cent.uw.edu.pl/index.html]58 onto the X-ray crystal structure of the closest variant. The 3D coordinates of glycan 2 were generated by using the carbohydrate builder GLYCAM-web site [http://glycam.org]. The glycosidic torsion angles of the monosaccharides were maintained as observed by X-ray crystallography, while those not resolved were defined according to the lower energy values predicted by the GLYCAM-web modeling tool. The resulting poses were used as starting points for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MD simulations were performed using the Amber16 program4 with the protein.ff14SB, the GLYCAM_06j-1, and the water.tip3p force fields parameters59,60. Next, the starting 3D geometries were placed into a 10 Å octahedral box of explicit TIP3P waters, and counter ions were added to maintain electro-neutrality. Two consecutive minimization steps were performed involving (1) only the water molecules and ions and (2) the whole system with a higher number of cycles, using the steepest descent algorithm. The system was subjected to two rapid molecular dynamic simulations (heating and equilibration). The equilibrated structures were the starting points for a final MD simulation at constant temperature (300 K) and pressure (1 atm). 1 μs molecular dynamic simulations without constraints were recorded, using an NPT ensemble with periodic boundary conditions, a cut-off of 10 Å, and the particle mesh Ewald method. A total of 500,000,000 molecular dynamics steps were run with a time step of 1 fs per step. Coordinates and energy values were recorded every 500,000 steps (500 ps) for a total of 1000 MD models. The detailed analysis of the H-bond and CH-π interactions was performed along the MD trajectory using the cpptraj module included in Amber-Tools 16 package.Glycan microarray binding of H3N2 viruses, HA proteins, and lectinsVirus isolates (25 µL) were diluted with PBS-T (PBS + 0.1% Tween, 25 µL) and applied to the array surface in the presence of oseltamivir (200 nM) in a humidified chamber for 1 h, followed by successive rinsing with PBS-T (PBS + 0.1% Tween), PBS, and deionized water (2×) and dried by centrifugation. The virus-bound slide was incubated for 1 h with the CR8020 A/H3N2 influenza hemagglutinin stem-specific antibody (made in-house, 100 µL, 5 µg/mL in PBS-T) and washed according to previous washing procedure. A secondary goat-anti-human Alexa 648 antibody (Thermo A-21445, 100 µL, 2 µg/mL in PBS-T) was applied, incubated for 1 h in a humidified chamber, and washed again as described above. The control lectins containing a biotin tag were visualized with Streptavidin-AlexaFluor555. Slides were dried by centrifugation after the washing step and scanned immediately. HAs were pre-complexed with human anti-streptag (made in-house) and goat-anti-human Alexa 555 (Thermo A-21433) in a 4:2:1 molar ratio, respectively in 50 µL PBS-T on ice for 15 min. The mixtures were added to the subarrays for 90 min in a humidified chamber. Wash steps after each incubation (e.g., enzyme treatment, HA, or antibody incubation) involved six successive washes of the whole slides with either twice PBS-T, twice PBS, and twice deionized water. The arrays were dried by centrifugation and immediately scanned as described previously20. Processing of the six replicates was performed by removing the highest and lowest replicates and subsequently calculating the mean value and standard deviation over the four remaining replicates.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Here's what it means for milk supply. By Li Cohen Updated on: April 1, 2024 / 8:29 AM EDT / CBS News WHO: Bird flu risk low for humans Avian influenza strain discovered in mammals, World Health Organization monitoring spread 04:31 Multiple U.S. agencies said on Friday that for the first time, the rampant bird flu has spread to dairy cattle. Impacted cows have been found across several states as officials reemphasize the importance of only consuming pasteurized dairy products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the spread of the the bird flu, saying they tested sick cattle from dairy farms in Kansas and Texas. Those tests came back positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which has been impacting bird populations in Europe and Asia since August 2020 and "caused extensive morbidity and mortality events" in similar species across the U.S., according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. This marks the first time the bird flu has been found in dairy cattle, the American Veterinary Medical Association said, and the findings came just days after the virus was detected in goats on a Minnesota farm. In the fall, the bird flu also hit the polar bear species for the first time, killing one of the bears, and it has also spread to marine animals, killing tens of thousands of seals and sea lions. Bird flu was suspected of impacting U.S. cattle after dairy cows were found to be experiencing "decreased lactation, low appetite and other symptoms," agencies said in a joint news release. On March 25, they said milk samples showed two farms in Kansas and one in Texas were impacted. A swab from another dairy farm in Texas also yielded a positive result, they said. Bird flu was later found in a Michigan herd that had recently received cows from Texas, and "presumptive positive test results have also been received for additional herds in New Mexico, Idaho and Texas," officials said. Certain animal species that contract the virus usually do so from eating sick or infected birds. Among the dairy cows, however, officials say "transmission between cattle cannot be ruled out" based on reported symptoms and testing results. Those who own dairy cattle have been urged to minimize moving their cattle and test them when they do. They also recommended that sick cows be isolated. How will the bird flu impact U.S. milk supply? While impacted cattle are experiencing a decline in how much milk they produce, the government said that so far, the milk loss "is too limited to have a major impact on supply." "There should be no impact on the price of milk or other dairy products," the agencies said. "Further, the U.S. typically has a more than sufficient milk supply in the spring months due to seasonally higher production." There is also no concern from the agencies that milk in the commercial supply is unsafe. All milk products must be pasteurized and only milk from healthy animals is allowed to be sent to processing for human consumption, they added. "Milk from impacted animals is being diverted or destroyed so that it does not enter the human food supply," agencies said. "In addition, pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk. FDA's longstanding position is that unpasteurized, raw milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious health risks to consumers, and FDA is reminding consumers of the risks associated with raw milk consumption in light of the HPAI detections." The spread of bird flu to cattle comes just weeks after Texas cattle ranchers in the panhandle were devasted by the state's largest-ever wildfire. In the wake of the fires, thousands of dead cows had to be picked up across the scorched region. "Our producers in the Texas Panhandle have already endured enough," Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said, calling the situation "unprecedented." "The Texas Department of Agriculture will use every resource available to maintain the high standards of quality and safety that define Texas agriculture." Can bird flu spread to humans? While there have been cases of bird flu spreading to humans, health officials have said that these instances remain rare. "Initial testing by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories has not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans, which would indicate that the current risk to the public remains low," the USDA, FDA and CDC said on Friday. "Federal and state agencies are moving quickly to conduct additional testing for HPAI, as well as viral genome sequencing, so that we can better understand the situation, including characterization of the HPAI strain or strains associated with these detections."

The patient in Texas—who experienced eye inflammation as their only symptom and is clinically improving—was tested for flu late last week with confirmatory testing performed by the CDC over the weekend. The patient is being treated with the antiviral drug Oseltamivir, and the case does not change the risk to the general public, which remains low. Additionally, officials stress the state’s commercial milk supply is safe, due to the pasteurization process which is required for interstate commerce. According to CDC’s interim recommendations, people should avoid unprotected exposures to sick or dead animals including wild birds, poultry, other domesticated birds, and other wild or domesticated animals (including cattle), as well as with animal carcasses, raw milk, feces, litter, or materials contaminated by birds or other animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI A(H5N1)-virus infection. People should not prepare or eat uncooked or undercooked food or related uncooked food products, such as unpasteurized (raw) milk, or products made from raw milk, such as cheeses from animals with confirmed or suspected HPAI A(H5N1)-virus infection (avian influenza or bird flu). “This is an evolving situation in Texas. The current risk of infection from avian influenza to residents of Connecticut remains low. Because pasteurization kills pathogens, including avian influenza, in milk, residents of Connecticut should be reassured by the safety of drinking or eating pasteurized dairy products. While we have no evidence of human-to-human transmission at this time, we need to remain vigilant,” said DPH Commissioner Manisha Juthani, MD. Commissioner Juthani added that while seasonal flu vaccines do not provide protection against HPAI A(H5N1)-virus infection, the CDC is working with state health departments to continue to monitor workers who may have been in contact with infected or potentially infected birds/animals and test those people who develop symptoms. CDC also has guidance for clinicians on monitoring, testing, and antiviral treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed avian influenza A virus infections. According to the CDC, this is the second human case of H5N1 flu in the United States and the first linked to an exposure to cattle. On March 25, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC confirmed positive test results for highly pathogenic avian influenza in Texas and Kansas dairy herds. Based on the information and research available, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health. Dairies are required to send only milk from healthy animals into processing for human consumption, and milk from affected animals is not entering the food supply. Pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk. “At this time, there are no confirmed cases of H5N1 in dairy cattle or other livestock in Connecticut. We are monitoring this situation as it evolves nationally and continue to amplify the informationshared from federal partners on a local level,” said Connecticut DoAg Commissioner Bryan P. Hurlburt. “We encourage Connecticut producers to enhance their on-farm biosecurity measures for the health and safety of livestock and farm workers.” In addition to enhancing biosecurity, Commissioner Hurlburt added that producers and veterinarians should report cases of sick cattle to State Animal Health Officials at 860-713-2505 or ctstate.vet@ct.gov.

It added that the risk to general public is low."Avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses have only rarely been transmitted from person to person," authorities said. "As such, the risk to the general public is believed to be low; however, people with close contact with affected animals suspected of having avian influenza A(H5N1) have a higher risk of infection."The state department of health, however, has warned health care providers to be vigilant about the sign and symptoms of bird flu, especially among people who have regular contact with animals.Bird flu in dairy cattle in Kansas, TexasThe U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that the highly contagious pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) had been found in unpasteurized clinical samples of milk from ill cows at two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, plus a swab from a dairy cow in Texas.The agency said its officials, along with the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state veterinary and public health authorities, were investigating an illness detected primarily in older dairy cows in those states, as well as in New Mexico.Wild migratory birds are believed to be the source of the infection, the USDA had said.What is bird flu? Bird flu is a disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted among birds.Avian influenza viruses, according to the CDC and the USDA, are classified into two groups: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI, often seen in wild birds) and HPAI, found mostly in domestic poultry. According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds.Bird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds were slaughtered last year to limit the spread of the virus.Bird flu symptomsSigns and symptoms of bird flu, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, can include:Fever (temperature of 100 degrees or greater), or feeling feverish or experiencing chillsCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseHeadachesFatigueEye redness (conjunctivitis)Difficulty breathing/shortness of breathDiarrheaNauseaVomitingSeizuresIn some cases, infected patients may also experience conjunctivitis, or redness in the eyes, the department says.Those infected with avian influenza experience symptoms ranging from mild to severe, says the health department, explaining that reports of severe illness in humans "have included fulminant pneumonia leading to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and (even) death."Health care providers have been advised to immediately consult their local health department if they come across patients who are experiencing the symptoms and have come into close contact with livestock and cattle.Contributing: Natalie Neysa AlundSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Morry Gash/AP Photo State leaders are urging Wisconsin dairy producers to take extra precautions against the spread of avian influenza. The U.S. Department of Agriculture first confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in dairy herds in Kansas and Texas last week. Cases in Michigan and Idaho have also been confirmed, as well as a presumptive positive test in a New Mexico herd. Texas health officials reported Monday a person in direct contact with infected dairy cows has tested positive for the virus. The Texas agency said in a press release that the patient experienced eye inflammation as their only symptom and is being treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir.

It’s the second confirmed human case of the highly infectious H5N1 flu in the U.S., according to the CDC. The first case in 2022 was in a person who was culling infected poultry on a Colorado farm. Health officials said the case does not change the risk for the general public, which remains low. USDA said in a press release Friday that initial testing of the virus has not found changes that would make it more transmissible to humans. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, said the case highlights the importance of immediate action by dairy farmers if they see disease symptoms in their animals, which can include decreased lactation and low appetite. He said the people working on a farm with sick animals should be monitored closely. “We don’t think that it’s a significant public health threat at this point,” Poulsen said. “But just like in our farms with poultry (highly pathogenic) avian influenza, they’re getting a large challenge, so we need to watch them very closely, and make sure that everyone is provided with the best public health care that we have available.” Federal and Wisconsin officials have reiterated there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or consumer health because dairy products are pasteurized before being sold. Pasteurization has been proven to inactivate viruses like influenza, according to the USDA. Infected dairy herd may be first sign that virus can spread between cows Since the virus’ 2021 emergence in the U.S., officials believe the current avian flu has been spread mainly through exposure to infected wild birds. In Wisconsin, 36 poultry farms in 21 counties have been affected since the first case in March 2022, according to the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. Poulsen said the affected dairy herd in Michigan has raised new concerns that the virus may now be able to spread through lateral transmission within a herd. “At first, we thought that wasn’t happening based on the sequence of the virus,” he said. “But now, I think there’s mounting evidence that cows are infecting other cows.” He said this transmission has not been confirmed and animal health officials are still working to answer a number of questions about the virus. The USDA press release said cows affected by the avian flu virus have recovered after isolation with “little to no associated mortality reported.” Poulsen said that is very different from infected birds, which tend to die within a few days of infection. He said that’s why affected poultry flocks are euthanized when the virus is found, which can also reduce further spread of the virus in birds. But he said the low mortality rate in cows could mean federal or state officials make a different recommendation for cattle. Wisconsin farmers upping protections, staying alert for signs of virus in the state Sarah Sarbacker, communications director for FarmFirst Dairy Cooperative in Madison, said there isn’t an immediate fear of the virus in her organization’s farmer members. But she said most producers are watching the news closely and taking proactive steps to increase biosecurity. “Making sure that they know who is coming on to their farm, and for people that do come to visit the farm, things as simple as putting plastic covers on their boots,” she said. A spokesperson for Edge Dairy Farmer Cooperative declined an interview with WPR, but said in an email the group is reminding its members to follow on-farm biosecurity measures. Sarbacker said most dairy producers were confused to hear the virus could be transmitted from birds to cows. She said farmers’ main concern moving forward is how easily it can be passed within a herd. She said the producers in her cooperative are turning to state and federal agriculture officials for guidance, as well as industry groups like the National Milk Producers Federation. “They’re keeping a very close eye on their animals, reducing new cattle that are coming in and reporting anything that’s the slightest bit unusual to their veterinarians, just to kind of keep tabs on things,” she said. An update from DATCP said Wisconsin veterinarians treating herds with unexplained symptoms should contact the state agency. Dairy producers should also be sure to follow the state’s import rules, which include requiring official identification and certificates of veterinary inspection.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A person in Texas likely caught bird flu from a dairy cow, health officials have reported. (Image credit: Volker Rauch/Shutterstock.com) A person in Texas has tested positive for bird flu after being in contact with dairy cows that were likely infected with the virus, health officials announced on Monday (April 1).The individual's only reported symptom was eye redness, likely caused by an infection of the eye called conjunctivitis. The person is now isolating and being treated with an antiviral drug for influenza, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).This is the second reported case of a human in the U.S. being infected with a type of "highly pathogenic" avian influenza virus called A(H5N1) and the first person to likely be infected by cows. The first human case in the U.S. was in 2022 and involved a prisoner in Colorado who had been culling infected poultry at a commercial farm as part of a pre-release employment program.H5N1 is a subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), a type of flu that can cause severe disease and death in birds. The virus causes outbreaks in both poultry and wild birds but can also spread to mammals. In the past few years, the virus has been reported in more than 48 mammal species, including foxes, skunks, raccoons, seals and polar bears.Now, the virus has made its way to cows. The announcement of a person likely catching H5N1 from cattle comes one week after dairy cows in Texas and Kansas tested positive for the virus, and two weeks after the disease was found in goats for the first time. H5N1 has since been detected in cows in New Mexico, Michigan and Idaho.Health officials say the risk of humans being infected remains low and that, as milk is pasteurized before being sold, dairy products remain safe. The meat supply is also safe, and cooking meat to safe internal temperatures kills viruses like influenza.RELATED STORIES—1st human case of H3N8 bird flu reported in 4-year-old boy in China—Russia reports first cases of humans catching bird flu H5N8—Dozens of ancient viruses are 'switched on' in healthy cells throughout our bodiesNonetheless, the spread of H5N1 among mammal species is concerning scientists, especially if it's a sign that the virus is now capable of mammal-to-mammal transmission.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over."Mammal-to-mammal transmission has been suspected for a while, but not confirmed. If sequencing confirms this, it would be a pretty worrying step in the evolution of the virus," Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist and statistical geneticist at the Queen Mary University of London, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. "If mammal-to-mammal transmission can occur, that raises the possibility of the potential of human to human transmission."About 860 human cases of H5N1 have previously been reported worldwide. The mortality rate is around 60%, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), although the CDC notes some cases cause no or few symptoms. Symptoms can include a cold, cough and fever, and the infections are typically treated with the same antivirals used for seasonal flu.This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

However, a press release from MDARD indicated it was a commercial egg operation.“Michigan’s egg farmers are among the most proactive in the country, with their diligence leading to rapid detection of HPAI in this flock,” Dr. Nancy Barr, executive director of Michigan Allied Poultry Industries said in the release. “Strict biosecurity measures are in place to protect flocks from the increased threat of HPAI.”This is the fourth commercial poultry flock in Michigan to have the presence of HPAI confirmed during the 2022-24 HPAI outbreak. The three previous cases all involved commercial turkey operations. Two of those were confirmed in December 2023, and collectively affected about 79,400 birds. The other case was confirmed in May 2022 and involved about 35,100 turkeys.This is the first case in Ionia County poultry.The Ionia County poultry case was announced less than a week after MDARD revealed that cattle in a dairy herd in Montcalm County, Michigan, had tested positive for HPAI. Ionia County is directly south of Montcalm County.Other states to have confirmed cases of HPAI in dairy cattle include Texas, Kansas and New Mexico, while Idaho has had a presumed positive case.To learn more about HPAI cases in commercial poultry flocks in the United States, Mexico and Canada, see an interactive map on WATTPoultry.com.

stomach viruses, strep throat, upper respiratory illnesses, asthma flare-ups, COVIDDr. Kelly Levasseur -- Chief of Pediatric Emergency Medicine at Children’s Hospital of Michigan“We are seeing patients coming in with influenza, with high fevers, body aches and cold symptoms. In addition, we’re seeing quite a few stomach virus patients, with vomiting and diarrhea. Patients are also coming in with strep throat. Also, please talk to your kids in advance about not looking at the eclipse on Monday without proper safety glasses. It’s so important to protect their eyesight.”Dr. Jaime Hope -- Medical director, Emergency Medicine, Beaumont Outpatient Campus – Livonia, a part of Corewell Health“We are still seeing a lot of flu and some COVID. Now that everyone is back from Spring Break, we expect to see another round before it dissipates for spring. We are also seeing a higher number of falls as people are out and about in this warmer weather. This is a reminder for those starting yard work to use caution on ladders!”Dr. Roy Elrod -- Chief of Emergency Medicine at DMC Detroit Receiving Hospital“With the current weather conditions, we’re still seeing some upper respiratory illnesses, including some asthma flareups, cases of influenza and some COVID. Patients with sore throats and some stomach virus cases are also coming in for care.”Dr. Christopher Loewe -- Ascension St. John Hospital“I’m still seeing a lot of patients with influenza. This is just a reminder to wash your hands and avoid touching your face. A lot of infections can spread from touching your eyes and nose.”OAKLAND COUNTY – Stomach viruses, influenza, COVID, strep throat, spring allergiesDr. Steve McGraw -- Director of Emergency Medicine, Ascension Providence Hospital, Southfield and Novi Campuses“The flu seems to be receding along with COVID, but still some sporadic cases. More strep throat and seasonal allergies are now presenting to the EDs. Also seeing quite a bit of viral stomach infections, such as enteroviruses and noroviruses. Everyone stay home if you are sick and wash your hands frequently.”Dr. Susan Bork -- Director of operations, Emergency Center, Corewell Health William Beaumont University Hospital in Royal Oak“We are seeing a lot of viral gastroenteritis in the community causing symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In pediatrics, we continue to see both influenza A and B as well as baseline mild COVID. Careful handwashing especially before eating is needed to help prevent disease.”Emergency Department, Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital“This week we are seeing a lot of altered mental status from our nursing home facilities along with stroke-like symptoms. We’re also seeing respiratory symptoms, chest pain and falls.”Washtenaw County – Influenza, stomach viruses, upper respiratory infectionsDr. Marisa Louie -- Medical Director of Children’s Emergency Services, Michigan Medicine“Our visits had declined as the area students were on break, but they swung back up again as of yesterday, We seem to be seeing quite a bit of vomiting and diarrheal illnesses. Some of those have been influenza positive.”Dr. Brad Uren -- Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine“Still some upper respiratory infections. Less detected flu and covid this week. A fair amount of GI illness last few days, up from last week.”Washtenaw County Health Department“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents are currently at high levels, but appear to be decreasing. Most Influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw County are Influenza A, types A(H1N1) and A(H3). Sporadic cases of Influenza B are being reported. Influenza-related deaths in Washtenaw County adults have been reported this flu season. All individuals were older adults with confirmed Influenza A infection.

The bird flu virus H5N1 has been spreading among cows in the U.S. (Image credit: Bloomberg / Contributor via Getty Images) Editor's note: This is a developing story and will be updated.A bird flu virus called H5N1 recently infected animals that it had never been seen in before: goats and cows. Now, it's suspected that four people have picked up the infection after being exposed to infected cows, or potentially their bodily fluids or bedding.Here's what we know so far about these unusual cases of H5N1 in the U.S.Related: 21-year-old student dies of H5N1 bird flu in VietnamWhat is H5N1 bird flu?H5N1 is a subtype of avian influenza A, a broad group of related bird flu viruses. It's categorized as a form of "highly pathogenic" avian influenza, or HPAI, because it causes severe and fatal disease in poultry. For example, H5N1 and other "H5" bird flu viruses can rapidly cause organ damage in chickens and kill up to 90% to 100% of chickens they infect, often within 48 hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). H5N1 has been responsible for the major bird flu outbreaks seen on U.S. poultry farms and on farms in other countries since 2022.Although HPAI viruses are known for devastating domestic bird populations, H5N1 also infects wild birds and occasionally infects various mammals, including people. In non-avian species, it can still cause fatal disease, but some cases are mild or asymptomatic.H5N1 infections in mammals, in general, raise concern that the virus could evolve to infect humans more easily and perhaps spread widely between people, sparking a pandemic, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). But scientists haven't seen any changes in the virus that suggest that's happening at this point.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Which animals can H5N1 infect?H5N1 most often infects domestic and wild birds, although some wild birds act as "reservoirs" for the virus, meaning they can carry and spread it without getting sick. These carriers include waterfowl, such as ducks, geese and swans; and shorebirds, such as plovers and sandpipers, the CDC says.In the past 20 years or so, H5N1 has also been detected in at least 48 mammal species across 26 countries. These include foxes, bears, seals, sea lions and polar bears, as well as pet cats and dogs and farmed mink. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) maintains a map of where different mammals have been infected in the U.S.This year, for the first time, H5N1 was detected in goats and cows. This marks the first time H5N1 has been found in ruminants, which include hooved, cud-chewing mammals like cows, goats and sheep.The infections among goats were reported in mid-March on a Minnesota farm where ducks and chickens had previously tested positive for the virus. The first infections in cattle were reported a week later among dairy cows in Texas and Kansas, which also likely got the virus from birds.Related: 'Novel' swine flu virus sickens Pennsylvania child in 1st case of the yearH5N1 was spotted in goat kids just before it was found in cows. (Image credit: Lori Van Buren/Albany Times Union via Getty Images)Where has H5N1 been detected in cows?After being detected in cows in Texas and Kansas, H5N1 infections were also confirmed in cows in Idaho, Michigan and New Mexico, according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. As of June 14, the USDA has reported that 92 dairy cow herds in 12 U.S. states have confirmed cases of infection. Early data suggest that the specific strain of H5N1 infecting cows matches one introduced to the U.S. by wild birds — known as clade 2.3.4.4b — back in 2021. Before that, the strain had spread mostly in Europe, Asia and Africa."[H5N1] could have been infecting dairy cattle a year ago. We just never thought about looking … for it," Dr. David Swayne, a bird flu expert who is now a private consultant after having worked for the USDA, told STAT. Experimental data published in 2008 suggested that at least one H5N1 strain can infect baby cows, so it's not totally unexpected to see the virus in cattle.The recently infected cows have been reported to produce less milk, show poor appetite, develop cold-like symptoms and become lethargic. There have been no reported deaths among the cows. Can H5N1 infect people, and how dangerous is it?H5N1 can occasionally infect people and can lead to death, with about 50% to 60% of reported cases resulting in fatal disease. More than 880 human cases of H5N1 have been reported worldwide since the late 1990s, according to the CDC.Most often, human H5N1 infections occur after a person had close or lengthy unprotected contact — without gloves, a face mask or eye protection — with infected birds or with objects contaminated with sick birds' saliva, mucus or poop. These cases have not been tied to sustained human-to-human spread of the virus, but there's been some evidence of very limited spread between people.Although H5N1 infections can be fatal, some people show no symptoms or only mild symptoms. Mild symptoms might include eye infections, such as conjunctivitis (pink eye), and upper respiratory symptoms, like sneezing and coughing. Severe cases can lead to life-threatening pneumonia.Bird flu can be treated with antiviral drugs used for seasonal flu. The CDC also has several candidate vaccines prepared for manufacturing, just in case this or a closely related virus were to suddenly spread between people; seasonal flu vaccines do not protect against H5N1.There have been five human cases of H5N1 in the U.S. The first was in 2022, in a person in Colorado who'd had direct exposure to infected poultry. It's possible that this case wasn't a full-blown infection but rather remnants of the virus being detected in the person's nasal passages. The second case was in April 2024, when a person in Texas caught the virus after likely being exposed to infected cows; this person's only reported symptom was pink eye. The third was reported in Michigan in May 2024, also in connection with infected cows on a farm. This third individual also only showed eye-related symptoms. The fourth case was reported later in May 2024, when a worker at a different Michigan dairy farm developed mild respiratory symptoms, including cough. The fifth was reported in July 2024, in a dairy worker in Colorado who developed only eye symptoms.Related: 1st-known 'highly pathogenic' bird flu cases in Antarctic could threaten penguinsThe U.S. milk and beef supply are both safe, officials have confirmed. (Image credit: Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images)Should you worry about H5N1 in cows?Finding H5N1 in cows is interesting to scientists because it hasn't been seen before, but as of now, it poses a low risk to the general public.As for cows, there's some early hints that the virus can spread among cattle — the cows in Idaho reportedly became sick after being exposed to cows shipped from Texas, Science reported, and the Michigan cases were also thought to be tied to cows from Texas, the CDC reported. However, H5N1's ability to spread among cows still needs to be confirmed.In regards to people, "initial testing has not found changes to the [H5N1] virus that would make it more transmissible to humans," the USDA noted in an April statement. "While cases among humans in direct contact with infected animals are possible, this indicates that the current risk to the public remains low."The CDC also reported that there have been no changes to the virus that would make it less vulnerable to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antiviral drugs for the flu.Nevertheless, the CDC recommends that people avoid sick or dead animal carcasses, including wild birds, poultry and cattle. They should also avoid raw milk, poop, litter or other materials contaminated by animals with suspected H5N1 infections, and they should avoid uncooked and undercooked food products from such animals.Is the milk and beef supply safe?The discovery of H5N1 in cows does not threaten the country's milk supply, the USDA noted. Dairies are required to send only milk from healthy animals into processing for human consumption, and the commercial milk supply is pasteurized before going to market, which kills viruses. Unpasteurized milk always carries a risk of causing dangerous infections, but the likelihood of H5N1 infection from raw milk is not yet known.Related: H5N1 bird flu can remain infectious in raw milk for at least an hour, study findsSince March 25, shortly after news of the cow infections came to light, weekly sales of raw milk have increased by as much as 21% compared with previous years. But experts have warned that consuming raw milk could expose individuals to dangerous pathogens, alongside increasing the likelihood of H5N1 gaining the necessary mutations to jump to and spread between humans. Notably, there isn't yet enough evidence to know whether drinking raw milk contaminated with H5N1 could result in a human infection.RELATED STORIES—UK's first human case of H5N1 avian flu detected in man with pet ducks—China reported 1st human death from H3N8 bird flu, WHO says—A branch of the flu family tree has died and won't be included in future US vaccinesMore information on milk safety given the current situation can be found on the FDA's website.So far, H5N1 has been found in dairy cows, but the USDA also emphasized that the beef supply is safe and that cooking meat properly kills viruses.Editor's note: This article was updated on July 5 to note an additional human case of H5N1.

Here’s what to know about themThis article is more than 7 months oldAllen ChengWith the flu season starting and peaking earlier, there have been several enhancements to influenza vaccines. What are they? And which one should you get? Wed 3 Apr 2024 01.10 BSTShareInfluenza is a common respiratory infection. Although most cases are relatively mild, flu can cause more severe illness in young children and older people.Influenza virtually disappeared from Australia during the first years of the Covid-19 pandemic when public health restrictions reduced contact between people. Since 2022, it has returned to a seasonal pattern, although the flu season has started and peaked a few months earlier than before 2020.It’s difficult to predict the intensity of the flu season at this point in the year, but we can sometimes get clues from the northern hemisphere. There, the season started earlier than usual for the third year running (peaking in early January rather than late February or March), with a similar number of reported cases and hospitalisations to the previous year.Influenza vaccines are recommended annually, but there are now an increasing number of different vaccine types. Here’s what to know about this year’s shots, available from this month.What goes into a flu vaccine?No one likes a flu jab, but the rewards are greatRead moreLike other vaccines, influenza vaccines work by “training” the immune system on a harmless component of the influenza virus (known as an antigen), so it can respond appropriately when the body encounters the real virus.Influenza strains are constantly changing due to genetic mutation, with the pace of genetic change much higher than for Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid). The strains that go into the vaccine are reviewed twice each year by the World Health Organization, which selects vaccine strains to match the next season’s predicted circulating strains.All current influenza vaccines in Australia contain four different strains (known as quadrivalent vaccines). One of the strains appeared to disappear during the Covid pandemic, and the WHO has recently recommended dropping this strain from the vaccine. It’s expected trivalent (three strain) vaccines will become available in the near future.What’s different about new flu vaccines?There are eight brands of flu vaccines available in Australia in 2024. These include egg-based vaccines (Vaxigrip Tetra, Fluarix Tetra, Afluria Quad, FluQuadri and Influvac Tetra), cell-based vaccines (Flucelvax Quad), adjuvanted vaccines (Fluad Quad) and high-dose vaccines (Fluzone High-Dose Quad).Until recently, the process of manufacturing flu vaccines has remained similar. Since the development of the influenza vaccine in the 1940s, influenza viruses were grown in chicken eggs, then extracted, inactivated, purified and processed to make up the egg-based vaccines that are still used widely.Given indications this year’s flu season may be earlier than usual, it’s probably safest to get your vaccine earlyHowever, there have been several enhancements to influenza vaccines in recent years.Older people’s immune systems tend not to respond as strongly to vaccines. In some flu vaccines, adjuvants (components that stimulate the immune system) are included with the influenza antigens. For example, an adjuvant is used in the Fluad Quad vaccine, recommended for over 65s. Studies suggest adjuvanted influenza vaccines are slightly better than standard egg-based vaccines without adjuvant in older people.An alternative approach to improving the immune response is to use higher doses of the vaccine strains. An example is Fluzone High-Dose Quad – another option for older adults – which contains the equivalent of four doses of a standard influenza vaccine. Studies suggest the high dose vaccine is better than the standard dose vaccine (without an adjuvant) in preventing hospitalisation and complications in older people.Other manufacturers have updated the manufacturing process. Cell-based vaccines, such as Flucelvax Quad, use cells instead of eggs in the manufacturing process. Other vaccines that are not yet available also use different technologies. In the past, manufacturing issues with egg-based vaccines have reduced their effectiveness. Using an alternative method of production provides some degree of insurance against this in the future.What should I do this year?Given indications this year’s flu season may be earlier than usual, it’s probably safest to get your vaccine early. This is particularly important for those at highest risk of severe illness, including older adults (65 years and over), those with chronic medical conditions, young children (six months to five years) and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Influenza vaccines are also recommended in pregnancy to protect both the mother and the baby for the first months of life.Australia faces another record flu season – and children’s vaccination rates are alarming | Asha Bowen and Christopher BlythRead moreInfluenza vaccines are widely available, including at GP clinics and pharmacies, while many workplaces have occupational programs. For high-risk groups, four of the vaccines are subsidised by the Australian government through the National Immunisation Program.In older people, a number of vaccines are now recommended: Covid and influenza, as well as one-off courses of pneumococcal and shingles vaccines. In general, most vaccines can be given in the same visit but talk to your doctor about which ones you need.Are there side effects?All influenza vaccines can cause a sore arm and sometimes more generalised symptoms such as fever and tiredness. These are expected and reflect the immune system reacting appropriately to the vaccine, and are mostly mild and short-term. These side effects are slightly more common in adjuvanted and high dose vaccines.As with all medications and vaccines, allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis can occur after the flu vaccine. All vaccine providers are trained to recognise and respond to anaphylaxis. People with egg allergies should discuss this with their doctor but in general, studies suggest they can safely receive any (including egg-based) influenza vaccines.Serious side effects from the influenza vaccine, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, a neurological complication, are very rare (one case per million people vaccinated). They are thought to be less common after influenza vaccination than after infection with influenza. Allen Cheng is professor of infectious diseases at Monash University.

The person has only exhibited eye inflammation so far, and the CDC says risk to the public remains low. However, this highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza has scientists on edge for a variety of reasons. H5N1 was first detected in 1996, but the current highly pathogenic outbreak emerged in 2020 in Europe. Since then, the virus has spread across the world, flaring up particularly high during bird migrations in the fall and spring. As of March 27, the virus has infected more than 82 million farmed birds in the U.S. Overall, it’s the most severe bird flu outbreak in the country’s history. While the virus is adapted to most effectively infect birds, it can mutate and spillover into other species, including mammals. Scientists are still trying to figure out the factors making this outbreak so severe and how to contain it, but recent research shows that climate change and environmental destruction could be aiding the spread of avian flu—and a variety of other animal-borne illnesses. Agricultural Illnesses: Over the past few years, bird flu has devastated the poultry industry, causing an estimated loss of at least $1 billion in revenue for farmers (you may be feeling part of the impact of this as egg prices surge at supermarkets). Typically, when bird flu is detected at a chicken farm, the entire flock is euthanized, a practice that activists and many scientists believe is inhumane, writes Marina Bolotnikova for Vox. On March 25, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the presence of avian influenza in dairy cows in Texas and Kansas—and later, New Mexico. This is the first time cows infected with the virus have been detected, stumping scientists and stoking fear across the cattle industry. “The fact that they are susceptible—the virus can replicate, can make them sick—that is something I wouldn’t have predicted,” Richard Webby, an influenza virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, told The New York Times. Officials say that consumers should not be concerned about commercial milk supplies, but recommend that dairy and beef farm workers practice biosecurity measures such as wearing protective gear. But the Texas Animal Health Commission noted that the disease is causing a decrease in viable milk production, which could drive losses across the dairy industry, reports the Texas Tribune. Wildlife Catastrophe: Outside the farm, bird flu has been picking its way through the animal kingdom. Since it first arose, H5N1 has been identified in a range of species including mink, dolphins, grizzly bears, foxes, and a polar bear. It’s been especially devastating for marine mammals; in Argentina, bird flu killed 17,400 southern elephant seal pups, roughly 96 percent of all young born in 2023, researchers estimated. “We found silence and massive numbers of carcasses,” Marcela Uhart, a wildlife veterinarian at the University of California, Davis, told National Geographic. “All ages, new and old, just piled up on the beach where there should have been living, happy animals.” While scientists have successfully vaccinated a small population of California condors against H5N1, there are virtually no strategies to mitigate the spread of bird flu in wild animals at the moment. The Climate Component: A few weeks ago, I wrote about the various ways climate change is throwing the seasons out of whack and how this can mess with animal migrations. It turns out that for birds, these changing migrations can contribute to the severity and spread of avian flu, according to the CDC and recent research. For example, climate change is shifting the range of some birds during the winter toward the poles, and spring migrations are happening earlier due to warming temperatures. This can increase the chances of something called “virus reassortment,” or the exchange of viral genetic material, if the species interacts with bird populations or different species they had rarely overlapped with before. Scientists are still parsing out the connection between climate change and avian flu. But it’s clear the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain has “moved outside the bounds of its typical seasons,” wrote Zoya Teirstein for Grist last year. “How come this virus is popping up in the middle of summer in the Mediterranean Sea or when it’s minus 20 or 30 in a commercial farm in Canada? There’s close to 80 countries in the world with this problem, we’ve never seen that before,” Jean-Pierre Vaillancourt, a professor in the department of clinical sciences at the University of Montreal in Canada, told Grist. “That’s why we’re seriously looking at climate change.” A growing body of research finds that climate change is fueling the spread of all sorts of zoonotic illnesses, including West Nile virus and malaria. On top of this, humans are increasingly encroaching on wild animal habitats through deforestation and development, which could expose us to the diseases these species carry. Stopping the Spread: Last March, in an article for Foreign Affairs, epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers detailed all of the ways that the U.S. could prepare for an intense bird flu outbreak, from restocking health supplies to scaling up vaccine production. Yesterday, she tweeted that the piece is “still relevant” today. Other public health experts have echoed Rivers’ call to action, urging the importance of early disease surveillance to stop outbreaks before they even begin. In the technology space, early experiments suggest that gene editing in chickens can protect poultry farms from flu outbreaks, reports Wired. More Top Climate News For the past few years, the U.S. government has been ramping up efforts to revive the struggling nuclear industry, the latest being a $1.5 billion loan to restart a decommissioned nuclear plant in Michigan, announced by the Biden administration on Wednesday. The money will enable manufacturer Holtec International to upgrade the plant and keep it running until at least 2051, reports the Times. Some experts say that nuclear power could help meet the astronomical demand for electricity in the U.S. without releasing excess emissions. “Nuclear power is our single largest source of carbon-free electricity, directly supporting 100,000 jobs across the country and hundreds of thousands more indirectly,” Jennifer M. Granholm, Biden’s energy secretary, said in a statement on Wednesday. Meanwhile, officials are investigating the environmental impacts of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore, report Royale Bonds and Rona Kobell for the Baltimore Banner. Large amounts of steel and concrete fell into the Patapsco River during the collapse, and the ship that crashed into the bridge contained 1.5 million gallons of fuel and lube oil, which could affect fish and bird populations if too much leaks into the water, experts say. In breaking news, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced today that a dead endangered North Atlantic right whale was spotted in the waters off Virginia, marking the fourth documented death in 2024. The female was at least 35 years old and had given birth to a calf earlier this year, which is not expected to survive on its own. Scientists from the University of North Carolina Wilmington are currently leading a necropsy to determine the whale’s cause of death. “The situation so far in 2024 for right whales highlights the fact that much more needs to be done to prevent the extinction of this species,” Amy Knowlton, senior scientist in the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium, who helped identify the whale, said in a statement. “It is frustrating that solutions that could address these threats are not being implemented more immediately.” I’ve written several times about the main threats that North Atlantic right whales are facing—entanglement and vessel strikes—and ways that governments can help mitigate them.

A person who worked on a dairy farm and had “direct contact with dairy cattle” tested positive for bird flu in Texas, according to state health officials. Cynthia Goldsmith/CDC CNN — A person who worked on a dairy farm and had “direct contact with dairy cattle” tested positive for avian flu in Texas late last week, the state’s Department of State Health Services said Monday. The case was confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the weekend, the department said.

The Couvoirs de l'Est company, which sell chicks to stockbreeders, reduced its production to face the falling demand due to risks of bird flu in France. FREDERICK FLORIN/AFP/Getty Images Related article Bird flu isn’t a direct threat to humans yet, experts say, but they’re keeping a close eye on the virus The CDC said the person who has the H5N1 virus is recovering and was told to isolate. Their only symptom was eye inflammation, and they are being treated with oseltamivir, the Texas health department said. Oseltamivir is the generic version of the antiviral medication Tamiflu. The department is working with local, state and federal health partners to investigate the case and has issued an alert asking health care providers to monitor for any additional cases of avian influenza. “The case does not change the risk for the general public, which remains low,” the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement. The CDC also said Monday that the risk is low but said it is monitoring the situation. “Because influenza viruses constantly change, continued surveillance and preparedness efforts are critical, and CDC is taking measures in case the public health risk assessment changes. This is a developing situation, and CDC will share additional updates as new relevant information becomes available,” the agency said in a news release. According to the Texas health agency, the CDC said this is the first case of H5N1 flu in a person linked to dairy cattle and the second case in a person in the US. A Colorado man who had direct exposure to poultry and the culling of birds had bird flu in 2022. There is no risk to the commercial milk supply, the Department of State Health Services said. “Dairies are required to destroy or divert milk from any sick cows, plus pasteurization kills avian flu viruses,” it said in the statement. Avian flu is a type A influenza virus that originated in birds and has been detected in more than a hundred species like seagulls, owls and ducks in the US since 2022. Many mammals in the US, mostly in the West and Midwest, have been infected with the virus in this latest outbreak.

Cases have also been reported among bears, foxes, possums and seals. Scientists say those animals probably got sick when they ate or interacted with infected birds. The virus can spread through feces and saliva and through contact with contaminated surfaces. Human-to-human transmission of avian flu through close contact is “very rare,” according to the CDC. Symptoms of the virus can range from no symptoms at all to mild – with flu-like illness or eye redness – to severe, with cases reported of pneumonia requiring hospitalization.

William Brangham discussed more with Jennifer Nuzzo of the Pandemic Center at Brown University’s School of Public Health. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: There is growing concern tonight about the continuing spread of the highly contagious bird flu in the U.S.As William Brangham explains, while federal health officials say the risk to humans is low, the virus has now spread to dairy cattle and sickened one person — William. William Brangham: That's right, Geoff.This strain of bird flu, called H5N1, has been sickening bird flocks across America for a few years now. Millions have been killed to prevent further spread. Yesterday, the country's biggest egg producer halted productions when chickens at one of its facilities got sick.But this virus has also been infecting mammals, most recently dairy cows, in five different states. This week, a person in Texas tested positive after working with cattle. He's had mild symptoms and is expected to recover.For more on this virus, we are joined again by Jennifer Nuzzo. She runs the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health.Jennifer Nuzzo, so good to have you back on the program.Dr. Mandy Cohen, the head of the CDC, says the risk to humans from this virus is low, they're monitoring it, and there's no reason to worry at this point. Is that where you come down?Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, Brown University School of Public Health: So I think it's true that the risk to the general public is quite low, and I think it's also important that we continue to monitor this virus to make sure that doesn't change.The one thing I do quite worry about is the risk to farmworkers, people who would be exposed to the sick animals, because we do know that exposure to sick animals can result in human infection. And we have already seen that now to date in two cases in the United States, the most recent one being in a worker that worked with sick cows.So I do worry about protecting farmworkers. But for the general public, the risk of contracting this virus is currently low. William Brangham: Let's talk about that infection.So, this was someone who apparently had been working with cattle, cattle that had been infected with this bird virus. How should we see that route of infection? Because this does happen every now and then, a widespread infection amongst animals, and it jumps to one human. Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo: Yes, so we have been tracking this virus for 20 years.And in the last two years, I would say, it has become a lot more concerning in terms of the number of species that this virus has shown itself capable of infecting. We have historically called this a bird flu virus because it has predominantly affected wild birds and domesticated birds.But over the last two years, we have really seen the species range that has been affected by this virus grow quite a bit, to include mammals. So that's quite alarming. This is also the first time we have seen it in cows. Cows haven't frequently been seen to get influenza A, which is the particular type of influenza virus this one is. So that is also somewhat new and surprising.But we have in the past see humans that have had direct contact with sick animals get sick. It doesn't happen all that frequently. But when it does happen, it's quite concerning, because, in many of these cases, that infection has been quite deadly. Fortunately, in the most recent case, the infection has been quite mild. In fact, the symptoms are a little bit different than what we have typically seen in the past.The sick worker had conjunctivitis and eye inflammation. And so while, we're glad to see a mild infection, we don't yet understand why that is. William Brangham: So, for now, at least, jumping from a group of animals to one human is one thing. But if it were to go from human to human, that's when it would be really troubling; is that correct? Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo: The predominant reason that we're worried now is because we're worried that this virus may gain additional functionality and additional ability to infect humans, so that we could see human infections occur more frequently.And the worst-case scenario that we worry about is this virus gaining the ability to be transmitted easily between humans. In the past, there have been a few cases that we haven't been able to rule out limited human-to-human transmission, but that human transmission hasn't been sustained and it's been very rare relative to the number of human cases we have seen.But we're watching this virus primarily to make sure it doesn't gain the ability to infect humans more easily and, worse, to be spread between humans easily. William Brangham: And, right now, there is no evidence of that happening? Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo: No, there is not. So we're not worried currently, but we don't often get head starts or sort of early warnings about future health threats.And so why you're hearing a lot of scientists, experts and health officials talking quite concerned — in a concerned manner about this particular development is because we want to make sure we get ahead of it. We want to make sure we don't allow this virus to infect many more animals or many more humans to give it any ability to gain the functionality to infect humans more easily. William Brangham: For people who are seeing that these are cases in dairy cows and egg-laying chickens and might worry, do I have to worry about milk and eggs, what do you tell them? Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo: Well, it's long been public health advice not to eat raw eggs or raw milk. And that public health advice still applies.As long as you're following that guidance, all the evidence we have so far is that you should be fine. William Brangham: The U.S., as you well know, has been focusing on the threat of pandemic influenza for decades now.But we saw how COVID punched all these holes in what we thought was a world-class, robust set of plans and preparations. Are you concerned that if — again, no evidence that this is happening now, but if this were to turn into something more severe, that we could respond in a smart and timely way? Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo: Well, I think that's why we're having this conversation now, is to talk about what triggers are going to make us act.I think our recent experience with COVID was quite humbling in a lot of ways. We have a bit more experience dealing with influenza and, in particular, dealing with a flu pandemic. People may not remember that we actually had a flu pandemic in 2009. That was not an H5N1 virus. It was an H1N1 virus.And in many ways, we do have more resources and more familiarity with flu. So, in some ways, you could imagine it easier. However, every type of event is going to be challenging. So, I think that's why it's really urgent that we use this moment where we are getting some concerning signals from the animal world about potential future human health threats to make sure we have everything we need to be able to respond if this virus does take a turn for the worse. William Brangham: All right, Jennifer Nuzzo, Brown University School of Public Health, always great to see you. Thank you so much. Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo: Thanks for having me.

A dairy worker in Texas has tested positive for avian influenza, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed Monday. The announcement comes just a week after the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) first announced avian flu outbreaks in certain dairy cow herds in Texas. It’s uncommon for humans to catch the H5N1 subtype avian influenza—also known as H5N1 bird flu—and the CDC said this case is only the second one reported in the U.S. The first case was in Colorado in 2022. The H5N1 bird flu is often found in wild bird populations, and sick birds can sometimes pass the virus to livestock or other mammals. In this most recent case, the person in Texas likely became infected after coming in close contact with sick cattle, health officials said. The case is relatively mild; the CDC said the patient has eye redness (conjunctivitis) but has no other symptoms. The person is being treated with an antiviral for flu, and is isolating. “This infection does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low,” the agency said in a press release. It acknowledged, however, that people who come into more frequent contact with possibly infected birds or other animals have a higher risk. Since 2022, bird flu has been detected in wild, commercial, and hobbyist bird flocks—in total, over 82 million birds have been affected across 48 states and 512 counties. These outbreaks can cause issues for farmers—on Tuesday, Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., the country’s largest egg producer and distributor, culled nearly 2 million hens after an outbreak of avian flu at one of its facilities. The USDA also found herds of dairy cows testing positive for bird flu in Kansas, Texas, Michigan, and New Mexico. It’s assuming a herd in Idaho will test positive, too. “That worries me, because humans interact pretty closely with dairy cattle,” said Jill Foster, MD, professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Minnesota Medical School. “You’ve got these dairy cows now that are infected, and people in the barn [are] pretty close with the dairy cows…I think that there’s probably going to be more spread to humans.” Here’s what to know about bird flu, how it spreads between animals and humans, and what this infection means for public health. Tim Graham / Getty Images What to Know About Bird Flu This particular type of avian flu—H5N1—is one of many different subtypes of influenza A. It’s “still the same influenza that humans get,” but the naming refers to slight differences in proteins, Foster told Health. Certain types of influenza A can lead to pandemics, such as the H1N1 “swine flu” in 2009 and the H1N1 “Spanish flu” in 1918 (which was later determined to be an “avian-like” virus.) This is what infectious disease experts have feared happening since this H5N1 virus started causing outbreaks among wild birds and poultry in late 2021, Foster explained. Luckily, however, this current strain of bird flu doesn’t seem to be mutating and making jumps into human populations in the same way as other problematic viruses, she said. “[The bird flu] seems to be something that just simmers and spreads quite easily. But it doesn’t seem to be one that changes a lot, the way that COVID [does],” said Foster. “Bird flu has been around for a couple of years, but has stayed mostly in the birds.” Though it can spread easily between birds and other animals, the H5N1 flu virus does not seem to be very efficient at transmitting between animals and humans or from human to human, Foster added. Whereas increasing COVID infections provided more opportunities for the virus to mutate and better evade our immune systems, the same cannot be said for H5N1, at least for now. In fact, limited spread between humans hasn’t been reported since 2007, and there’s no evidence that the bird flu could have sustained transmission in human populations. However, when people do get sick with bird flu, it can be a cause for concern. Some people are asymptomatic or have mild infections, where they’ll experience conjunctivitis or flu-like upper respiratory symptoms. But others will have more serious cases that can lead to pneumonia, fever, body aches, shortness of breath, and in very rare cases, diarrhea, nausea, or seizures. Since 2021, hospitalizations linked to various strains of bird flu have been reported in China and Cambodia, and China has reported over a dozen deaths. People who get sick with bird flu can be treated with the antiviral Tamiflu (oseltamivir), which works against influenza A. What To Know About Bird Flu, Including the H10N3 Strain How Might Bird Flu Affect Your Health? Because the risk to the general public in connection with this confirmed bird flu case is low, the average person doesn’t need to be too worried about contracting the H5N1 virus. “Human infection based on close occupational exposure to a sick animal is of course important to know about, but is also very different than the case of human-to-human transmission, which would be a concern for public health,” Sarah Hamer, PhD, DVM, director of the Schubot Center for Avian Health and professor of epidemiology at the Texas A&M University School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, told Health. However, those who may be coming into contact with sick poultry or dairy cows could be seeing a higher risk. “As soon as you start getting cases, you’re going to have more spread,” Foster said. Because of this, the CDC recommends anyone who could be coming into contact with ill or dead animals use proper personal protective equipment (PPE), including vented safety goggles, disposable gloves, boots, masks, disposable coveralls, and a head covering. “PPE is a big one. And then it’s just re-emphasizing things like proper hand hygiene, washing your hands frequently, if you’re not feeling well, staying home,” said Mike Kleinhenz, DVM, PhD, clinical associate professor of dairy cattle production at Texas A&M University School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. “Just reinforcing some of those good hygiene practices is important for dairy farmers to do—for their employees and for themselves.” As for where the average person comes into contact with dairy—the grocery store—there’s also little cause for concern. There’s no risk of people accidentally getting bird flu from consuming cow’s milk or other dairy products, so long as it’s pasteurized, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said. That process is able to effectively kill viruses such as influenza. And though transmission among cows is something experts are monitoring, for now, there’s no evidence that bird flu could lead to any major disruptions in the U.S. dairy market, Kleinhenz told Health. “From what we’re seeing on farms that are affected by this, [it’s] a small percentage of the cows that are actually becoming infected, and having to have their milk diverted from the saleable pool,” he said. “For the overall milk supply, we don’t expect to have shortages.” Raw Milk Is Growing in Popularity—But Is it Safe to Drink?

The CDC says that the current public health risk is “low.”Here's what scientists know right now about bird flu and food safety. EggsThe largest producer of eggs in the country, Cal-Maine Foods in Texas, temporarily stopped production at one of its facilities on Apr. 2 after H5N1 was identified there. The company also culled more than 3% of its flock in response to the outbreak.Eggs from infected chickens are unlikely to be on supermarket shelves, the FDA says. That’s because in the time that it takes to detect an avian flu virus in a flock of egg-laying chickens, 99.99% of eggs would not have reached store shelves yet, since they would still be in the process of being distributed. That prediction comes from a model for estimating the risk of human exposure from avian flu outbreaks that was developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010. According to that assessment, even if an infection among chickens was discovered after eggs had hit supermarket shelves, more than 98% of potentially contaminated eggs could be removed from stores after a recall was issued.Read More: Is Eating a Plant-Based Diet Better For You?Another safeguard: pasteurization inactivates viruses in eggs and therefore eliminates most risk to human health. Properly handling eggs—including avoiding cross contamination of any raw products with other foods—and cooking them at least until the yolks and whites are firm will further reduce any risk of infection.PoultryLike it is with eggs, the risk of buying infected chicken at the grocery store is very low, according to the USDA and FDA. The model predicted a 95% probability that infected poultry would not make it to stores, since the virus would lead to relatively high mortality among the chickens, and farmers would be aware of the infection before the poultry was prepared for sale. However, the scientists determined that there is a 5% chance that infected chickens reaching market size would be slaughtered and sold before the virus was detected.Read More: Why Your Diet Needs More Fermented PicklesThe best way to prevent that from happening is to increase testing of flocks on farms, the risk assessment concluded. Farmers can also detect illness in their flocks by monitoring how much feed the birds eat, since birds tend to eat less when they're sick. According to the risk assessment, keeping track of feed consumption can lead to a 96% chance that an infected chicken is not processed for market, and can reduce the risk of human disease by 23 fold, while checking for signs of sickness leads to a 95.5% chance that infected chickens are not processed for market and reduces the risk of human illness by 8-fold.As an added safety measure, keep raw chicken away from uncooked foods and cook chicken to 165°F, which likely inactivates any virus that could make people sick.More Must-Reads from TIMEHow Donald Trump WonThe Best Inventions of 2024Why Sleep Is the Key to Living LongerHow to Break 8 Toxic Communication HabitsNicola Coughlan Bet on Herself—And WonWhat It’s Like to Have Long COVID As a Kid22 Essential Works of Indigenous CinemaMeet TIME's Newest Class of Next Generation LeadersContact us at letters@time.comEdit PostHomeU.S.PoliticsWorldHealthBusinessTechPersonal Finance by TIME StampedShopping by TIME StampedFuture of Work by CharterEntertainmentIdeasScienceHistorySportsMagazineThe TIME VaultTIME For KidsTIMECO2CouponsTIME EdgeVideoMastheadNewslettersSubscribeDigital MagazineGive a GiftShop the TIME StoreCareersModern Slavery StatementPress RoomTIME StudiosU.S. & Canada Customer CareGlobal Help CenterContact the EditorsReprints and PermissionsSite MapMedia KitSupplied Partner ContentAbout Us© 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

An emerging new lineage 2.3.4.4b of avian influenza has been spreading across the globe since late 2020, carried by migratory birds following specific routes. This panzootic has a significant effect on the avian population with disastrous consequences to the ecology and significant economic loss affecting poultry across the world. In rare instances, the virus can infect mammals from birds causing spillovers, and in recent years, several such instances of spillovers spanning over 200 species have been noted, the most recent being polar bears in Antarctica. Close contact with infected animals could mean the virus could spill over infecting humans and this comes with a significantly large fatality rate.In late March 2024, a multistate outbreak of H5N1 in dairy cows was detected in the U.S. In what started as a mystery disease affecting dairy herds in Texas, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) detected the highly pathogenic strain of the virus in herds across the states of Texas and Kansas. The affected animals displayed symptoms including loss of appetite, low-grade fever, and reduced lactation. This marked the first time H5N1 had been detected in cattle, raising concerns about potential transmission routes and the broader impact on the dairy and meat industry. To date, H5N1 has been detected in over 12 herds from six states ­— Texas, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Idaho and Ohio.In Texas, other animals in proximity to the affected farms ­— wild birds and cats ­— also showed signs of illness and have tested positive for the virus. The exact extent of the spread of H5N1 in cows has not yet been ascertained since cattle are not routinely tested for avian influenza and the symptoms have been relatively mild, leaving possibilities that there may be other undetected infected herds. The initial detections in late March in Texas, Kansas, and Michigan have yet to show a definitive pattern of transmission. Given the pace of the spread of infection across herds, the transmission of the virus within cattle has not yet been ruled out. Investigations are ongoing to determine the exact source of the spread to cows.Subsequently, in April 2024, a human infection of H5N1 was reported from Texas. The infected individual reportedly had contact with cows presumed to be infected with the virus. Fortunately, the patient had mild illness, with symptoms like eye redness, and has recovered after being treated with antivirals. Following this case, the CDC has reiterated that the risk of infections for humans remains low, although people with prolonged or close exposure to H5N1-infected animals such as farm workers, are at a higher risk. This is the second case of human H5N1 infection reported from the U.S. A previous case was reported in 2022 from Colorado.Human H5N1 infections are rare but have been sporadically reported in several countries. H5N1 infections in humans can range from mild symptoms of eye infections to severe illness including pneumonia and death. Since 2003, more than 800 sporadic human H5N1 cases have been reported to the World Health Organization from over 20 countries, with a case-fatality ratio of 53%. In January 2024, concerns about H5N1 avian influenza rose in Southeast Asia when Cambodia reported two human cases, with tragically one resulting in death. A fatal case of H5N1 infection was also recently reported from Vietnam.Genomic insightsResearchers sequenced the H5N1 virus from both the infected Texas cows and the human case and found that both viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b of H5N1, with the human strain having one minor mutation potentially linked to adaptation in mammals. However, this change has not led to increased transmissibility among humans, and the overall public health risk remains low according to the CDC. Since late 2021, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has circulated in wild birds in the U.S., causing outbreaks in poultry and sporadic infections in mammals, including the recent Texas case.Globally, 2023 also saw potential spillover events with H5N1 linked to the deaths of seals in Russia and infections in marine mammals in Peru. Early in 2023, dead seals in Russia and infected marine mammals in Peru suggested H5N1 might jump from birds to mammals. Additionally, the U.K. reported deaths of other animals including otters and foxes due to H5N1. These incidents underscore the need for further research to understand how H5N1 might evolve and potentially adapt to different species.In summary, while the current risk of H5N1 transmission to humans is considered low, a combined approach of disease surveillance and monitoring the virus’s genetic makeup (genomic surveillance) will be crucial for managing the outbreak.(Bani Jolly is a senior scientist at Karkinos Healthcare and Vinod Scaria is a senior consultant at Vishwanath Cancer Care Foundation) Published - April 06, 2024 09:11 pm IST Read Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINTTop News Today0 / 0 Read in App The Hindu About Us Code of Editorial Values News Archive Sitemap Print Subscription Digital Subscription Subscribe to Newsletters Rss Feeds Readers Editor-Terms of Reference Authors & Contributors Frame Front page Contact us Contact Us Social Media Advertise With Us Group News Sites Business Line BL on Campus Sportstar Frontline இந்து தமிழ் திசை The Hindu Centre Young World Club The Hindu ePaper Business Line ePaper Crossword + Free Games Other Products RoofandFloor STEP Images Classifieds - Print Bookstore & Special Publications Popular Sections Elections Israeli–Palestinian conflict 2023 Latest News National News International News Videos Life & Style Food Podcast Showcase Opinion Editorial Columns Comment Cartoon Letters Interview Lead Business Agri-Business Industry Economy Markets Budget Sport Cricket Football Hockey Tennis Athletics Motorsport Races Other Sports Sci-Tech Science Technology Health Agriculture Environment Gadgets Internet States Andhra Pradesh Karnataka Kerala Tamil Nadu Telangana Cities Bengaluru Chennai Coimbatore Delhi Hyderabad Kochi Kolkata Kozhikode Madurai Mangaluru Mumbai Puducherry Thiruvananthapuram Tiruchirapalli Vijayawada Visakhapatnam Trending on The Hindu News PM Modi pays tribute to Sardar Patel India-China border patrol agreement PM Modi launches projects worth ₹12,850 crore Salman Khan gets death threat again Bomb threats to airlines Actor Darshan case Morning digest Oct 30 Army vehicle was fired upon in Battal area Kapil Dev meets AP CM Chandrababu Naidu Trending on Group sites Stock Market Live Updates Stocks to buy today Hockey Mogun Bagan Paralympics 2024 Gold Rate Today Silver Rate Today Sexual Harassment in Telugu Film Industry Mango: The Michael Jackson of Fruits Frontline Current Issue Terms of Use Privacy Policy Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Ridgeland, Mississippi-based Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. said in a statement that approximately 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets, about 3.6% of its total flock, were destroyed after the infection, avian influenza, was found at a facility in Parmer County, Texas. READ MORE: Texas patient diagnosed with bird flu after contact with cows presumed to be infected The plant is on the Texas-New Mexico border in the Texas Panhandle about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southwest of Amarillo and about 370 miles (595 kilometers) northwest of Dallas. Cal-Maine said it sells most of its eggs in the Southwestern, Southeastern, Midwestern and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. “The Company continues to work closely with federal, state and local government officials and focused industry groups to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks and effectively manage the response,” the statement said. “Cal-Maine Foods is working to secure production from other facilities to minimize disruption to its customers,” the statement said. The company said there is no known bird flu risk associated with eggs that are currently in the market and no eggs have been recalled. Eggs that are properly handled and cooked are safe to eat, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The announcement by Cal-Maine comes a day after state health officials said a person had been diagnosed with bird flu after being in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and that the risk to the public remains low. The human case in Texas marks the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal, federal health officials said. In Michigan, Michigan State University’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has detected bird flu in a commercial poultry facility in Ionia County, according to the Michigan’s Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. READ MORE: Dairy cows in Texas, Kansas test positive for avian flu The county is about 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Detroit. The department said it received confirmation of the disease Monday from the lab and that it is the fourth time since 2022 that the disease was detected at a commercial facility in Michigan. Department spokesperson Jennifer Holton said Tuesday that state law prohibits the department from disclosing the type of poultry at the facility. The facility has been placed under quarantine and the department does not anticipate any disruptions to supply chains across the state, Holton said. Dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with bird flu last week — and federal agriculture officials later confirmed infections in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received cows from Texas. A dairy herd in Idaho has been added to the list after federal agriculture officials confirmed the detection of bird flu in them, according to a Tuesday press release from the USDA. Associated Press writer Corey Williams in Detroit contributed to this report. Left: FILE PHOTO: Brown eggs are shown in their carton in a home in Palm Springs, California, Aug. 17, 2015.

The case is a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus type A, also known as H5N1 avian influenza, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).According to a press release, the patient has been treated with antiviral influenza medicine and has been asked to isolate to avoid further infections. The CDC states that this case does not change its assessment of the human health risk of H5N1 avian influenza to people in the United States, which it considers to be low. However, it points out, there are people who are at higher risk of becoming infected.This is the second human case of this type of virus in the United States. In 2022, a case was reported in Colorado. Since late 2021, CDC has detected outbreaks of this virus in wild birds and poultry. The Department of Agriculture confirmed cases of the virus in cattle in New Mexico in addition to others in Texas, where the case of the infected person also occurred.What is the bird flu?Avian influenza, or bird flu, is an infectious type of influenza that is transmitted between birds. Most strains of the virus cannot infect humans, but some, such as H5N1 — which was identified in 1997 — can infect humans.According to the CDC, H5 avian influenza is common in wild birds in the United States and globally.How common is it in humans?According to the CDC, human infections with this type of virus are rare but “have occurred sporadically around the world.”There are some people at higher risk of infection such as farmers, hunters, and other individuals who come into direct contact with possibly infected animals.What are the symptoms?Cases of H5N1 avian flu in the United States have had mild symptoms such as eye infection or upper respiratory symptoms, and severe symptoms such as pneumonia, which has resulted in some deaths in other countries.Other symptoms may include fever, muscle pain, headache, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, stomach pain, chest pain, nose or gum bleeding, and conjunctivitis. These may appear three to five days after infection.How is bird flu treated in humans?According to the National Health Service in England, patients with avian flu are treated with antiviral drugs, which can reduce the severity of symptoms, which in turn prevents complications and increases the likelihood of survival. These drugs can also be given to those who have been exposed to the virus.If symptoms are more severe and have caused other complications, treatment may be extended.How to prevent contagion?The CDC has a help center on its website where they point out preventive actions such as avoiding direct contact with wild birds and observing them only from a far distance. It is also advised to avoid exposure to other dead or sick animals such as domesticated animals, including livestock, as well as organic residues or possibly contaminated materials. If a dead or injured bird is found, report it and do not touch it.If they come in contact with an infected bird or other animal and develop symptoms, they should be isolated at home away from other household members and should not go to work or school until they are found to be free of infection. The local or state public health department should be notified so they can assist in offering help.Likewise, it is advisable to eat poultry that has been properly handled and cooked.Is there a vaccine for avian flu?Yes, there is a seasonal flu vaccine, which is recommended for anyone over six months of age, and should be given two weeks before exposure to possible infected birds. The CDC notes that this vaccine does not prevent infection but can reduce the risk of getting sick from both human and avian viruses at the same time.Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA EditionTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

Here's what to know about the virus and why some are concerned. What happened? Health officials in Texas announced on April 1 that a person in the state had the first case, ever in the state, of human H5N1 novel avian influenza A. "The patient became ill following contact with dairy cows presumed to be infected with avian influenza. The patient’s primary symptom was conjunctivitis," read a portion of the statement. Overall, this is the second case of human H5N1 infection in the country. The first case, according to the CDC, happened in 2022, and involved a person who had direct exposure to poultry. What's H5N1?

The H5 subtype, along with subtyped H7 and H9, are known to infect people. Avian influenza (or bird flu), according to the CDC, is a type of flu virus that naturally spreads among wild aquatic birds worldwide, and can infect domestic poultry, along with other bird and animal species. While Avian influenza A viruses can be classified into either a Low Pathogenic or Highly Pathogenic category, CDC officials note that the designations "do not refer to or correlate with the severity of illness in cases of human infection with these viruses," and that virus subtypes in both categories have caused mild to severe illnesses in infected humans. What are the symptoms? In 2022, the CDC said reported signs and symptoms of bird flu virus infections in humans ranged from having no symptoms or mild illness (such as conjunctivitis or mild flu-like upper respiratory symptoms) to severe symptoms that can include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Experts say in some cases, hospitalization may be required. Do humans normally get bird flu? Experts say bird flu viruses do not normally infect humans. With that said, however, infections (as mentioned above) can happen. In some instances, many people can be infected. According to the CDC's website, there have been at least four instances where an Avian influenza virus resulted in dozens of human cases. One of the bird flu outbreaks that received media attention was a H5N1 outbreak that happened in 1997 in Hong Kong, which resulted in 18 infections and six fatalities. A report by the Associated Press states that the government in the former British colony at the time closed live poultry markets, killed all the birds in the markets, and stopped bringing in chickens from Southern China in response to the outbreak. Can I get bird flu by eating poultry? The CDC says it's safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the U.S. "Properly handling and cooking poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165˚F kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses," read a portion of their website. Besides infecting people, how does the bird flu impact society? The AP has reported that poultry deaths from either the virus or culls were one of the reasons cited for soaring egg prices from 2022 to 2023. Is there a vaccine for bird flu? What about treatments?

(Photo by Marcus Brandt/picture alliance via Getty Images) The CDC's website states that the federal government "maintains a stockpile of vaccines, including vaccines against A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) bird flu viruses." As far as treatment is concerned, CDC officials say current flu antiviral drugs can be used to treat most bird flu virus infections. "However, some evidence shows flu antiviral drugs may not work as well against some A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) bird flu viruses that were first detected in Asia," read a portion of the CDC website. "When flu viruses evolve in ways that make antiviral treatment less effective, this is called antiviral resistance. CDC regularly tests bird flu viruses for antiviral resistance." What can I do to reduce my risk of getting bird flu? CDC officials say the best way to prevent bird flu is to avoid sources of exposure, whenever possible. The advice includes: 1. Avoid direct contact with wild birds, and observe them only from a distance. 2. Avoid unprotected contact with domestic poultry that look sick or have died. 3. Avoid touching surfaces that may be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or feces from wild or domestic birds. (This website does not provide medical advice.

Back to Healio Key takeaways: Milk from dairy cows in several states tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. A person in Texas has also tested positive for the virus after having exposure to dairy cattle. A person in Texas tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza after having exposure to dairy cattle that are presumed to also be infected with the virus, health officials reported. The CDC said it has confirmed the positive human test for influenza A(H5N1) virus, also referred to as “H5N1 bird flu.” The person, whose only symptom was eye redness, was treated with an influenza antiviral and is recovering, the CDC said. The patient was told to isolate while recovering, according to the agency. It was only the second time a person in the United States has tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza. The first case occurred in 2022 in a Colorado worker who was involved in the culling of poultry presumed to be infected with H5N1. The new case followed a recent report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that unpasteurized milk from sick dairy cows at two farms in Texas and Kansas — and a throat swab from another farm in Texas — had tested positive for the virus, and that cattle in New Mexico were showing similar signs of illness. Although the virus is common among birds in the U.S and globally, human infections are rare, the CDC noted. According to the latest CDC data, 48 states have reported H5N1 outbreaks in poultry. USDA officials said testing by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories has not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans, indicating that the current risk to the general public remains low. The CDC also considers the risk to the general public to be low, but noted there is an increased risk among people with close or prolonged unprotected contact with infected birds or other animals. For perspective on the new human case of H5N1, we spoke with Richard Webby, PhD, a faculty member in the department of infectious diseases at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. Healio: Is this the same avian influenza virus (H5N1) that has been killing birds around the world? Webby: Yes, it is essentially the same virus that has been circulating in birds with sporadic spillover to mammals in the U.S. for the past 3 years or so, which is also closely related to the virus circulating in many regions of the world. Healio: Is it concerning that it now appears to have made the jump to dairy cows? Webby: It’s really difficult to know what this means in terms of human risk. People obviously have more exposure to cows than we do to wild mammals, but so far, there isn’t any evidence that the virus in cows is any more infectious to humans than the viruses in birds. We really don’t know much about influenza in cows at all and what changes are likely. Healio: The CDC and USDA said the risk to humans still appears to be low. Do you agree with that? Webby: Yes, the virus is still very much a bird virus that has spilled over to cows — not a particularly human-adapted virus at all. Healio: What signs do you look for in situations like this that would raise your level of concern? Webby: Any evidence that this virus is continuing to circulate in cows, which I don’t think we know yet, would raise some concern levels. This would provide the virus with more chances to evolve. Healio: What is the state of the current stockpile of H5N1 vaccine, in the event that we would need it? Webby: The U.S. and some other countries do have stockpiles of H5 vaccine. There is not near enough for everyone but at least enough to offer to those at most risk, including health care workers. References: CDC.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa State Dairy Association) For days, federal officials have said some New Mexico dairy cows were sick with bird flu. On Tuesday, the state’s top veterinarian said that cows from two separate herds have been confirmed positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza and another herd has “presumptive positives,” meaning suspected positive cases. All of the known cases are in Curry County. “We don’t have an actual count of the cows individually,” said New Mexico State Veterinarian Samantha Uhrig. “We have a number of herds that have been confirmed.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday that one New Mexican dairy had confirmed cases of avian influenza, along with five more dairies in Texas. Also, a Texas dairy worker tested positive Monday for avian influenza A(H5N1) after being in contact with infected cows. The symptom he showed was conjunctivitis or reddened eyes. It’s the second case recorded in the U.S., according to health officials. First human case of bird flu in Texas detected after contact with infected dairy cattle The Texas Health Department issued an update Tuesday, finding that three cats on the dairy farms in Texas also tested positive for HPAI. In statements, federal health officials have emphasized that most of the public is at low risk for contracting avian influenza, but people in contact with birds and livestock are at higher risk. In a statement, officials said the New Mexico Department of Health is managing the diagnosis, treatment and prevention efforts. The department is using local public health offices to test dairy workers who are showing symptoms, said spokesperson David Barre. Any confirmed or probable cases will be monitored, and treated with a generic antiviral Oseltamivir, an alternative to Tamiflu. “To date, there are no laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) in New Mexico,” the statement stated. Who’s in charge? The New Mexico Department of Health said the New Mexico Board of Livestock is the lead agency in the state’s response on avian flu. Their website can be found here. The department is providing personal protective equipment, such as N-95 masks and face shields to dairies, Barre said. Uhrig said workers in contact with infected cows should use gloves, eye protection and masks. Several other New Mexico dairy herds are undergoing tests after some cows appeared sick, Uhrig said Tuesday. This includes collecting nose swabs, and samples of blood, fecal matter and milk. First, those are tested at state laboratories. Any positive samples are sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, operated by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at the USDA. The federal labs can issue a “presumptive positive generally in a day or two,” Uhrig said, but the confirmed positive results will be delayed for several days up to a week. “At this point, because it’s an emerging disease, they are doing whole-genome sequencing to actually confirm any positive, and that does take a longer period of time,” she said. A USDA spokesperson declined to make anyone from the agency available for an interview, and referred Source NM to news releases. What is avian influenza? This family of viruses usually only affects wild and domestic birds. Normally, these diseases do not spread to people or other animals, except when they come into direct contact with sick birds and carcasses. The virus is shed through bird’s mucus, feces and saliva, so coming into direct contact, or touching a contaminated item, could pass the virus to people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The viruses can “spill” from domestic birds, into wild bird populations, and then into other animal species. Infectious disease researchers said the viruses’ ability to adapt to different hosts and change its genetic code increases its pandemic potential. In 2009, the H1N1 variant (nicknamed the “swine flu”) was a new combination of genes from influenza viruses that infected pigs, people and birds. It infected 20% of the global population. Since early 2022, an outbreak of the (H5N1) variant of avian influenza has killed more than 50 million birds across the U.S. Their deaths drove up egg and poultry prices. Only two people were recorded with infections, one person in the U.S. and the other in the United Kingdom. Last November, a backyard flock in New Mexico’s San Juan County was confirmed to have contracted avian flu, killing 13 of 14 birds. Uhrig said that incident remained isolated. “At this time, we have not had any other detections,” she said. An infographic demonstrating how avian influenza from backyard chickens can infect people. (Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). What caused the outbreak in NM? There’s no answers yet, Uhrig said, but investigators are looking to water and feed sources that could have been contaminated by migratory birds. “We suspect that there may have been multiple introductions at different locations from wild birds,” Uhrig said. “We’re not really sure why it is now affecting cattle the way that it is. That’s the big question.” Uhrig said the method of transmission is still unclear. The transmission may be manually spreading by cows sharing the same feed bucket or touching infected objects. “We don’t have an indication that it is directly spreading from one cow to another, but that there may be some sort of mechanical transmission that’s a lateral transmission as well,” Uhrig said. “We can’t rule any of those things out.” She said symptoms are not respiratory. “In people, that’s what we look at: our nasal swabs, because that’s the route of transmission,” she said. “In cattle, the nasal swabs are not as hot, per se, with the viral load, but the milk does have a pretty heavy viral load.” Uhrig said the milk supply for humans is not at risk. Any milk from symptomatic cows is diverted and destroyed, she said, and most commercial milk is pasteurized — heated to kill viruses and bacteria. The New Mexico Department of Health urged residents against consuming unpasteurized or “raw” milk due to the potential for viral transmission. “The pasteurized dairy supply in New Mexico is safe because the pasteurization process effectively eliminates influenza viruses,” according to the statement. When reached for comment on Tuesday, a staff member at the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association referred all questions to Uhrig. Requests for comment sent to the Dairy Producers of New Mexico and popular Creamland Dairy went unreturned. GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.

Uhrig said that incident remained isolated. “At this time, we have not had any other detections,” she said. An infographic demonstrating how avian influenza from backyard chickens can infect people. (Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). What caused the outbreak in NM? There’s no answers yet, Uhrig said, but investigators are looking to water and feed sources that could have been contaminated by migratory birds. “We suspect that there may have been multiple introductions at different locations from wild birds,” Uhrig said. “We’re not really sure why it is now affecting cattle the way that it is. That’s the big question.” Uhrig said the method of transmission is still unclear. The transmission may be manually spreading by cows sharing the same feed bucket or touching infected objects. “We don’t have an indication that it is directly spreading from one cow to another, but that there may be some sort of mechanical transmission that’s a lateral transmission as well,” Uhrig said. “We can’t rule any of those things out.” She said symptoms are not respiratory. “In people, that’s what we look at: our nasal swabs, because that’s the route of transmission,” she said. “In cattle, the nasal swabs are not as hot, per se, with the viral load, but the milk does have a pretty heavy viral load.” Uhrig said the milk supply for humans is not at risk. Any milk from symptomatic cows is diverted and destroyed, she said, and most commercial milk is pasteurized — heated to kill viruses and bacteria. The New Mexico Department of Health urged residents against consuming unpasteurized or “raw” milk due to the potential for viral transmission. “The pasteurized dairy supply in New Mexico is safe because the pasteurization process effectively eliminates influenza viruses,” according to the statement. When reached for comment on Tuesday, a staff member at the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association referred all questions to Uhrig. Requests for comment sent to the Dairy Producers of New Mexico and popular Creamland Dairy went unreturned. GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.

By Sarah AschApril 2, 2024 10:15 amAgriculture & Animals, Health & Science, Texas Standard Original Pexels Texas has one confirmed case of bird flu in a person after diagnosing the same illness in dairy cows in the Panhandle in recent weeks. The person had direct contact with the sick cows before becoming infected, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. So far, there are no signs that the virus has evolved in ways that would help it spread more easily among people, federal officials have said. Dr. Jennifer Shuford, the commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said the person who tested positive for bird flu is already improving. “Thankfully, the case that has been identified of avian influenza in a human, that person is doing better and improving,” she said. “That person had a really minor illness. And the symptom that they complained of was conjunctivitis, which means just redness and irritation of the eyes. That’s not always really common with seasonal influenza, but it has been seen more in these avian influenza infections in people.” Shuford said avian influenza typically spreads from birds to people, and this case is unusual since the spread was from another mammal species to a person. “It’s an influenza virus. And so it’s spread often by breathing it in or by contacting the eyes, the nose or the mouth. There is also a potential that if somebody touches something and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth, that it could be passed that way,” she said. “A lot of this right now is being passed directly from birds to mammals or birds to humans. In this case, we suspect that it did go from a cow to a person. We haven’t seen a lot of transmission of this particular avian influenza between mammals or between humans. A lot of it’s just been in contact with sick birds.” » RELATED: Bird flu found in Texas dairies, but don’t worry about buying milk Shuford said the risk to the general public from this virus is still low. “We are working right now with dairy farms and dairy producers across Texas, since that’s where this has been identified in cows and where this one particular case came from in working with sick cattle,” she said. “And so we’re working with them to make sure that they’ve got proper precautions in place for workers who are working with sick animals, and that they know how to get tested and to prevent the spread of this on those particular farms.” Shuford said the best step people can take to prevent infection is to avoid contact with birds. “Avian influenza is usually in birds and so that’s wild migratory birds as well as poultry,” she said. “We’re telling people just that if they see dead or sick animals to not come in contact with them. If that’s part of their job, though, they should be wearing the correct protective equipment. That includes things like gloves and a mask and goggles and coveralls and boot covers to really protect themselves from being in contact with that virus.” Shuford said that despite the origin of the virus in this case, milk and other dairy products are still safe to consume. “Thankfully with these dairies that have been impacted, this milk is pasteurized and that pasteurization process kills this influenza virus. And so that pasteurization process should keep the current milk supplies safe,” she said. “In addition, they don’t put milk from sick cows into the milk supply (as an extra precaution). And so all of that milk is getting diverted and disposed of. But the milk that is entering the milk supply is pasteurized and therefore should be safe for human consumption.” If you found the reporting above valuable, please consider making a donation to support it here.

To receive it in your inbox every Thursday, and read articles like this first, sign up here. A dairy worker in Texas tested positive for avian influenza this week. This new human case of bird flu—the second ever reported in the United States—isn’t cause for panic. The individual’s illness was mild—an eye infection—and they are already recovering. There’s still no evidence that the virus is spreading person to person. The person who became infected in Texas likely picked the virus up from infected cows or poultry on the farm where he works. But the rash of recent infections among livestock is unsettling. Last month, goats in Minnesota tested positive. And avian influenza has now been confirmed in dairy cows in Texas, Michigan, Kansas, New Mexico, and Idaho. In some of those cases, the virus appears to have spread between cows. This week, let’s take a look at what we know about this new outbreak and what people are doing to prepare for further spread. The strain of flu infecting dairy cows—H5N1—is a highly pathogenic avian influenza. Scientists have been watching these viruses closely since the 1990s because of their potential to spark a pandemic. In 1997, avian influenza sickened humans for the first time. Eighteen people in Hong Kong became infected, and six died. Small spillovers into mammals aren’t uncommon for these viruses, especially in recent years. Avian influenza has been reported in mink, skunks, raccoons, coyotes, seals, sea lions, and bears, to name a few. But having the virus in domesticated mammals that come into frequent contact with humans is new territory. “Exactly what happens when an avian flu virus replicates in a cow and potentially transmits from cow to cow, we actually don’t have any idea at all,” says Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital who studies avian influenza. Here’s the good news: even though the virus is infecting dairy cows (and now one dairy worker), “this is still very much a bird virus,” Webby says. Genetic sequencing by the USDA and the Centers for Disease Control suggests that these new infections are caused by a strain of flu that’s nearly identical to the virus circulating in wild birds. Few of the changes they did identify would allow it to spread more easily in mammals. The spread of bird flu in cows is worrisome, but not as worrisome as it would be if the infections were happening in pigs, which are an ideal mixing vessel for flu virus. Pigs are susceptible to swine flu, avian influenza, and human influenza. That’s how swine flu emerged back in 2009—multiple viruses infecting pigs swapped genes, eventually giving rise to a virus capable of human transmission. Related StoryHow gene editing could help curb the spread of bird flu The disease kills millions of birds each year, and it has recently started to spread among mammals too. Mammalian infections with bird flu have mostly been one-offs, Webby says. A mammal gets infected by eating a dead bird or ingesting bird droppings, but the infection doesn’t spread. One notable exception occurred in 2022, when H5N1 popped up on a mink farm in Spain and quickly jumped from barn to barn. Scientists also suspect that in rare cases, the virus has spread among family members. Cow-to-cow transmission hasn’t been confirmed, but the fact that some cows became infected after the arrival of cows from affected herds suggests that it may be occurring. That transmission may not be via coughs and sneezes—the traditional way flu gets passed on. It could be indirect. “So an infected cow drinks from a trough of water and the next cow comes along and drinks from that same trough,” Webby says. How can we curb the spread among animals? That’s an ongoing debate. Vaccination is an option, at least for poultry. That’s common practice in China, Mexico, and a handful of other countries. Immunization doesn’t prevent infection, but it does reduce symptoms. That might curb the impact on flocks, but some experts are concerned that vaccinated flocks might allow the virus to spread undetected. Vaccination also would likely affect trade. Countries don’t want to import birds that might be infected. France decided to begin vaccinating ducks last year, and the USDA promptly announced it would restrict poultry imports from France and its trading partners. In the US, the current practice is to cull infected flocks. But there are signs that vaccination isn’t off the table. Last year the USDA began testing four vaccine candidates against the particular strain of H5N1 driving the current outbreak that has affected poultry across the globe. As a longer-term solution, researchers have also been working on creating genetically engineered animals that are resistant to bird flu. Last year, researchers created such chickens by using CRISPR to alter a single gene. For cattle, the current options to curb transmission are limited. Culling cattle would be a much harder sell because they’re so much more valuable than chickens. And cow vaccines for avian influenza don’t yet exist, although they would be relatively easy to produce. Bird flu has been on public health officials’ radar for more than two decades, and it has yet to make a jump into humans. “I do think that this particular virus has some fairly high hurdles to overcome to become a human-transmissible virus,” Webby says. But just because it hasn’t happened doesn’t mean it won’t: “We can be a little bit reassured that it’s not easy, but not assured that it can’t do it at all.” Luckily, even if the virus suddenly acquired the ability to spread in humans, it would be vastly easier to develop a vaccine than it was to create one for covid-19. A vaccine already exists against H5N1. Doses of that shot are sitting in the country’s national stockpile. “This is one case we’re a little luckier because it’s a pathogen that we know. We know what this is and what we have in the freezer, so to speak. We have a little bit of a leg up on at least getting started,” Paul Marks, the FDA’s top vaccine regulator, told a reporter at the World Vaccine Congress this week. It’s not clear how well those doses would work against the current strain of H5N1. But many companies are already working on improved vaccines. Moderna plans to test an mRNA vaccine against the H5N1 strain causing the current outbreak. mRNA technology has a major advantage over traditional production methods for influenza vaccines, which grow the virus in eggs. In the event of a bird flu pandemic, eggs could be in short supply. Even if enough eggs were available, it could take half a year to develop a vaccine. mRNA technology, however, could shorten that timeline dramatically. That’s good news. With avian influenza surging across the globe, there are more opportunities than ever before for the virus to hit on a combination of genes that gives it the ability to easily infect humans.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved NEWS Health News Bird Flu Still 'Several Mutations' Away From Infecting Many Humans, Experts Say By Korin Miller Updated on April 03, 2024 Fact checked by Nick Blackmer Print grafvision / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways A person in Texas contracted bird flu after having close contact with dairy cattle.This is only the second known bird flu case in humans in the U.S.Doctors say that people shouldn’t panic. Health officials in Texas say that a person in the state was infected with bird flu after coming into contact with dairy cattle that are “presumed” to have the virus. The patient’s primary symptom was conjunctivitis. They are now taking the antiviral drug oseltamivir, which is also used to treat other flu viruses. Health officials said in a press release that the case “does not change the risk for the general public, which remains low.” This is the second human case of bird flu in the U.S. and the first that is linked to cows. Prolonged Contact With Animals Is Necessary for Human Infection Bird flu, which is also known as avian flu, is a type of influenza A virus that usually doesn’t infect people. However, this has happened before. “There have been a number of cases of avian influenza in humans across the globe, but only a couple of cases here in the U.S.,” Thomas Russo, MD, professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York, told Verywell. “Individuals who have acquired avian influenza have had close and prolonged contact with infected animals.” These bird flu illnesses in people have ranged in severity from people who have no symptoms to some having a severe illness that led to death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There are different types of bird flu. Asian lineage H7N9 and Asian lineage H5N1 have caused the most human illnesses from bird flu viruses around the world. How Does Bird Flu Spread? Infected birds usually shed the bird flu virus through their saliva, mucus, and poop. People can then get infected if the virus gets into their eyes, mouth, or nose, such as via inhalation. Most human infections that have happened occur after someone has unprotected contact with infected birds or touches surfaces that are contaminated with bird flu viruses. Other animals, including pigs, horses, and cows, can also contract bird flu viruses. It is rare for bird flu viruses to spread from an infected person to another person. However, the CDC noted that it has happened before—it’s just only spread to a few people. “There’s no evidence at the moment that this virus has the genetic capacity to spread widely and readily from person to person,” William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told Verywell. Bird Flu Symptoms There’s been a range of symptoms reported in people who have had bird flu, including: Eye redness (aka conjunctivitis)Mild, flu-like upper respiratory symptomsFever or feeling feverishCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesHeadachesFatigueShortness of breath or trouble breathing It’s less common, but someone with bird flu may also experience diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or seizures. The latest bird flu patient had conjunctivitis, which Russo said can happen. “Symptoms are usually more respiratory, but infectious particles can cause infections when they get into the body, including the eyes,” he said. Symptoms of Bird Flu How Common Is Bird Flu in Humans? Doctors stress that bird flu is not common in humans at all. The latest case is only the second bird flu case detected in humans in the U.S. “This is more common in other parts of the world where people in rural areas live very close with their poultry, but even then it’s rare,” Schaffner said. “There is no evidence of a wide spread of this virus in humans.” Russo agrees. “There have only been a small number of cases of avian influenza in people across the globe,” he said. Schaffner points out that the World Health Organization (WHO) has strong surveillance for several types of flu, including bird flu. “We’re looking harder and in a more sophisticated way than we were able to look for influenza strains even five years ago,” he said. “The harder you look, the more you’ll find.” Bird Flu Is Still Mostly a Concern for the Birds Why Is Bird Flu Dangerous? While bird flu cases in the U.S. have been mild, they have been serious and even deadly abroad. “Influenza is one of those respiratory viruses that can cause pneumonia and interfere with our breathing,” Schaffner said. “The usual influenza viruses are particularly dangerous for the very young, the very old, frail, and immune-compromised populations.” Russo said that there is a “potential concern” bird flu spreading more in people, but said there’s no sign right now that this is going to spread in the larger population. “For this to be able to infect humans effectively, it needs several mutations,” Russo said. “But this virus has been around for a while, and so far, we have not seen a high number of cases.” Doctors said that it’s important for public health experts to continue to monitor bird flu cases in humans, though, especially after the latest strain jumped to cattle. “We don’t want to give the virus too many chances,” Russo said. Still, Schaffner stresses that there’s no need to panic. “Everyone should take a deep breath and relax,” he said. What This Means For You Unless you work closely with poultry and other livestock, there is no need to worry about contracting bird flu. However, if you had close interaction with birds, cows, or other animals and developed flu-like symptoms afterward, it’s a good idea to reach out to your doctor about next steps. 4 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

(Katie Greene | MLive.com) The Grand Rapids Press/MLiveBy Rose White | rwhite@mlive.comA highly contagious deadly bird flu has been detected at Herbruck’s Poultry Ranch, one of the nation’s top egg producers and the biggest poultry farm in Michigan.This is Michigan’s fourth commercial poultry farm to be infected since the highly pathogenic avian influenza started spreading in 2022.“Herbruck’s is heartbroken by the loss of any hen, and we were devastated to learn that some of the hens at our Green Meadow Organics facility are infected with highly pathogenic Avian Influenza,” said a statement from Greg Herbruck, CEO of Herbruck’s Poultry Ranch, headquartered in Ionia County.Green Meadow Organics is separate from the company’s main poultry farm in Saranac.The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced Tuesday, April 2 that a commercial flock in Ionia County had been infected. The news comes less than a week after bird flu was detected in a herd of Michigan dairy cows and only one day after the second human case was reported in Texas.The U.S. Department of Agriculture requires entire infected flocks be “depopulated” or killed to prevent the disease from spreading to other birds.Related: A chicken started gasping for air. Three days later, more than 60 birds were dead.Herbruck’s Poultry Ranch, which confirmed the infection at Green Meadow Organics, did not disclose how many of their birds were affected. The generational family farm has a flock of 10 million birds across facilities in Michigan, Indiana and Pennsylvania. They supply eggs to grocery stores across the Midwest and sold 56 million dozen eggs to McDonald’s in 2021.“Over the weekend, our company veterinarian noticed sick birds at the facility and lab results confirmed our fears that Avian Influenza was present,” Herbruck said. “Our team worked quickly to implement protocols to protect the rest of our flocks – along with our longstanding biosecurity measures – including prohibiting movement between our Green Meadow Organics facility and other sites.”More than 82 million birds have died in the United States – making it the deadliest outbreak of avian flu.Wild birds carrying the virus can infect backyard and commercial flocks. The flu, which is particularly deadly for chickens with a 90% to 100% mortality rate, spreads easily through contact with infected poultry, equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of farmers.The latest count from March shows nearly 118,000 birds have died in Michigan. It was last detected twice in December at Muskegon County turkey farms – impacting nearly 80,000 birds.“As the weather remains cool and wild birds continue their migration, conditions are ideal for the virus to thrive and spread. While these conditions persist, the need to take preventative measures will be high,” said State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland in a statement. ”Keeping HPAI out of Michigan’s domestic animals remains a team effort, and it must be a top priority for all.”Related: A deadly bird flu raised egg prices. Michigan farms vigilantly protect flocks.Some measures include wearing protective Tyvek suits, cleaning all trucks on site and requiring employees to shower. At Herbruck’s, biosecurity measures have included requiring staff to wash their car tires, spray their shoes and swap out personal clothes for uniforms and boots that stay on the farm.“Michigan’s egg farmers are among the most proactive in the country, with their diligence leading to rapid detection of HPAI in this flock,” said Dr. Nancy Barr, executive director of Michigan Allied Poultry Industries. “Strict biosecurity measures are in place to protect flocks from the increased threat of HPAI.”Major outbreaks at poultry farms last year are one of the reasons egg prices soared to nearly $5 a dozen in early 2023. Egg prices started to climb again in recent months – going from $2.06 to nearly $3 for a dozen Grade A eggs – after millions of birds were infected in November and December.Related: Dairy cows from commercial Michigan farm infected with bird flu“We remain committed to protecting the rest of our flocks and keeping our team members and customers informed during this challenging time, as we work as quickly and safely as possible to disinfect and begin production again at this farm,” Herbruck said.In the past week, bird flu was detected for the first time in dairy cattle from Texas, Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico. Cows from Texas infected the herd in Michigan, genome testing confirmed. And a person who contracted the virus had contact with infected cattle in Texas.Officials emphasize that no animals or products infected with bird flu will enter the food chain and the public health risk from avian flu remains low.Read more statewide coverage from MLive7 things to know about Michigan’s extra 26,662 votes that had been unreportedKent County a ‘bluish shade of purple’ as voters split tickets in 2024 election Michigan readers react to results of the 2024 presidential race10 road closures to watch for this week in MichiganMichigan sets voter turnout record — but turnout shrank in 8 of 9 Democratic countiesIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

LANSING, Mich. (FOX 2) - The highly infectious strain of influenza that comes from birds has been detected in a commercial poultry farm in west Michigan, the state reported Tuesday. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza was confirmed by the Michigan State University vet lab after it found its presence in an Ionia County flock. It's the fourth detection of bird flu in a commercial facility in Michigan since 2022. While the news is unfortunate, it's not surprising since HPAI tends to spread during migratory season for birds. As wild birds continue their flight, concerns over HPAI spreading will remain, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said in a news release. Conditions will remain idea for the virus to thrive and spread in the cool conditions, the state vet said. "Keeping HPAI out of Michigan’s domestic animals remains a team effort, and it must be a top priority for all," said Dr. Nora Wineland, the state veterinarian. Just days earlier, MDARD reported bird flu was detected in a dairy herd in Montcalm County. According to federal and state testing, the source of the infection was cattle that had come from an affected premises in Texas before it was delivered to Michigan. The cattle were not symptomatic at the time of departure, a news release said. Wineland said the contagiousness of the virus enables it to spread from wild birds to the animals they come into contact with. Mammals can also contract the virus. As of April 2, the public health risk is still low, MDARD says. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Monday that HPAI had been detected in a person in the U.S. The individual was in Texas and had been exposed to dairy cattle that were infected. Related article CDC warns of invasive bacterial outbreak amid spike in cases and fatality rates An invasive bacterial infection is on the rise in the U.S., according to the CDC. A physician at Ohio State's Wexner Medical Center shared tips on treatment and prevention. Individuals who have had close or prolonged unprotected exposure to infected birds are at the greatest risk of infection. There are a few key ways to protect bird flocks in Michigan: Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed.Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops.Disinfect boots and other gear when moving between coops.Do not share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms.Clean and disinfect equipment and other supplies between If it cannot be disinfected, discard it.Use well or municipal water as drinking water for birds.Keep poultry feed secure to ensure there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents. For anyone who needs to report a potential case, there are two avenues depending on the kind of bird. If they're domestic birds, owners and caretakers should watch for multiple sudden deaths within the flock, a drop in egg production, or significant decrease in water consumption. Those who are worried should call MDARD at (800) 292-3939. For wild birds, anyone who notices any unusual or unexplained deaths among wild bird populations should report the case to the Department of Natural Resources through their Eyes in the Field app or by calling the lab at (517) 335 5030.

Texas Texas reports human case of avian flu virus, DSHS issues health alert by: Abigail Jones Posted: Apr 1, 2024 / 12:45 PM CDT Updated: Apr 2, 2024 / 12:21 PM CDT by: Abigail Jones Posted: Apr 1, 2024 / 12:45 PM CDT Updated: Apr 2, 2024 / 12:21 PM CDT SHARE AUSTIN (KXAN) — The Texas Department of State Health Services, or DSHS, reported Monday a human case of avian influenza A(H5N1), also known as bird flu, in the state. According to a press release from the department, the person had direct contact with dairy cattle presumed to be infected with avian influenza. Related: Dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas test positive for bird flu DSHS did not specify where the person lives or where they contracted the virus, however, officials last week confirmed an illness that impacted dairies in the Texas Panhandle was bird flu. DSHS has issued a health alert asking health care providers around affected dairies to be vigilant for possible human cases and is providing testing and treatment recommendations. The person’s only reported symptom was eye inflammation, according to the release. They were tested for the virus last week with confirmatory testing performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the weekend, and they’re now being treated with antiviral drug oseltamivir. DSHS said the case “does not change the risk for the general public, which remains low.” The release also said the CDC has only reported one other human case of H5N1 in the U.S., and this is the first linked to an exposure to cattle. DSHS said it is working with TAHC, CDC and other state and federal health agencies to investigate the human and animal cases and understand how the virus is spreading in order to protect livestock and people who work with it. According to the CDC, bird flu refers to the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. These viruses naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. The CDC’s website says bird flu viruses do not normally infect humans, however, sporadic human infections with bird flu viruses have occurred. DSHS maintains that the cattle infections do not present concern for commercial milk supply, and said dairies are required to destroy or divert milk from any sick cows, and pasteurization kills avian flu viruses. Texas officials confirm dairy outbreak poses no threat to consumer supply or public health DSHS sait it’s providing guidance to affected dairies about how to minimize workers’ exposure and how people who work with affected cattle can monitor for flu-like symptoms and get tested. Illnesses in people with H5N1 flu infections have ranged from mild, such as eye infection and upper respiratory symptoms, to severe, such as pneumonia and death, according to the DSHS release.

News Cow Milk Illness CDC Texas Health and Medicine Influenza FDA USDA Beverages Cow Illness Spreading in US States Sparks Concerns About Milk Published Apr 01, 2024 at 4:47 PM EDT By Natalie Venegas Weekend ReporterFOLLOW Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! A positive human case of the avian flu at a Texas dairy farm is sparking concern across the country about milk supply among cows.According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), avian influenza or bird flu is a disease "caused by infection with avian influenza Type A viruses." These viruses can also naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species.According to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) on Monday, a human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in the state was identified in a person who had direct exposure to dairy cattle who were presumed to be infected."The patient, who experienced eye inflammation as their only symptom, was tested for flu late last week with confirmatory testing performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the weekend. The patient is being treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir," DSHS said in a statement.According to the CDC, this is the second human case of H5N1 ever recorded in the country. However, there is no current evidence to suggest the virus is being spread among humans.As a result of the reported case, a public health expert is speaking out about the virus. Rick Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), previously cautioned that avian flu could pose a serious threat as he wrote in a 2023 Think Global Health column about the concern that it might become transmissible between humans."They would have to do a lot of testing before I would drink milk from one of these farms at this point," Bright told Politico on Monday.Newsweek has reached out to Bright via the Milken Institute email for comment.

A cow is seen on June 14, 2023, in Quemado, Texas. A positive human case of the avian flu at a Texas dairy farm is sparking concern across the country about milk supply among cows. Brandon Bell/Getty Images Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, was a bit skeptical about the milk and said it would be still be vital to understand whether the virus is changing in a way that makes it more adaptable to spread among humans."I don't necessarily suspect that to be the case because I don't think cows are particularly like humans in that way," she told Politico. "But any time the epidemiology of a virus changes it makes me listen more closely."However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it's not aware of milk or food products from symptomatic cows entering interstate commerce, adding that there is "no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply" because of pasteurization, which heats milk to a temperature that would kill the virus.Dairy farms are legally required to only supply milk from healthy animals and, on top of this, the pasteurization process helps kill viruses and bacteria.In an emailed statement to Newsweek, DSHS reiterated on Monday afternoon that "milk from sick cows is required to be destroyed and is not sold. Pasteurization also kills avian flu viruses."

Meanwhile, the CDC, FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said the virus was found in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received cows from herds in Texas.Despite similar concerns over the milk supply, the USDA said in a statement regarding the positive cases, "At this stage, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health."The CDC has said while it considers HPAI A(H5N1) viruses to have the potential to cause severe disease in infected humans, it considers the human health risk to the U.S. public to be low."Although human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) virus are rare, having unprotected exposure to any infected animal or to an environment in which infected birds or other animals are or have been present can pose a risk of infection," the CDC said in a press release.

Hans Pennink / AP fileApril 1, 2024, 11:09 PM UTCBy Kaitlin SullivanA person in Texas has been diagnosed with a highly virulent strain of bird flu, the first such case since the virus was detected in a handful of dairy cattle in several states across the country last week.The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement Monday that the infected person worked on a dairy farm where some cows tested positive last week for the H5N1 strain of bird flu, which is considered to be a highly pathogenic, or infectious, strain. The patient’s main symptom was pink eye.Sid Miller, commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture, said it’s not yet clear whether the person was infected by a dairy cow or through the same source that infected the dairy cows, which appears to be dead waterfowl that were found on the property.Regardless of the source, Miller said the public should not be worried. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a similar statement Monday, saying, “This infection does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low.”Cases of this particular strain of avian flu in humans are rare but fatal in more than 50% of those infected, according to the CDC. A 21-year-old man in Vietnam died March 23 after being infected with the virus, according to a statement from the Vietnamese Ministry of Health. The case in Texas is the second human case of this strain of bird flu ever detected in the U.S. The first case was confirmed in 2022, in a Colorado man who was a state prison inmate and exposed to the virus while working on a poultry farm as part of a pre-release employment program. The man’s only symptom was fatigue. He was treated with an antiviral and recovered, according to a CDC report. There have also been four cases in people infected with a less virulent strain of bird flu in the U.S.; there have been more cases of both types of the virus in humans in other parts of the world, according to the CDC.The often-deadly virus, which spreads quickly among birds, including domesticated chickens, has been spreading more rapidly among nonbird species, including polar bears, foxes and marine mammals. The first-ever cases of the H5N1 strain in dairy cows were detected last week in Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas. These cases came just days after goats on a farm in Minnesota tested positive for the virus, though Miller noted the cases did not appear to be spreading rapidly and that the cases in cattle were relatively isolated. Dr. Jeff Bender, a professor of public health and public health veterinarian at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, said that as birds carry out their spring migrations, there will likely be more pockets of outbreaks in other animals.“That’s what is driving what we are seeing with the cattle, as these birds are doing their spring migration, they may be shedding the virus,” Bender said, noting that the birds’ feces could contaminate animals’ water sources.In a statement last week, the CDC said it considers the human health risk to the U.S. public from the virus to be low, though people who work with livestock are at higher risk of infection. The agency also advised against eating unpasteurized dairy products, such as raw milk or cheese, from animals with suspected or confirmed cases of bird flu.“Commercial milk and meat is safe,” Bender said. No milk from the infected cows entered the food supply, Miller, the Texas commissioner, said.If it were to, “high heat in pasteurization and cooking would kill the virus,” Bender said.According to the CDC statement, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it does not expect the bird flu cases in cattle to affect food safety or supply in the U.S.“There shouldn’t be increases in prices in milk or milk products,” Miller said. Right now, the H5N1 strain does not appear to be airborne, and the virus does not appear to have mutated to spread between cows, which is important, Bender said.“That is something that needs to be monitored at this early stage,” he said. “We know how influenza changes. We need to know, do we have cattle-to-cattle transmission? That means the virus is adapting and it means there are more chances for the virus to change.”Some of these changes could make the virus more adept at infecting humans, or allow it to jump from person to person.“We need that information so we can, if needed, respond to an emerging pandemic,” Bender said.If the virus begins to infect pigs, that would be cause for worry, he added.“Swine have the ability to mix influenza viruses and they are more similar to humans, so that would be more likely to spill over into humans,” he said.There is a small stockpile of vaccinations for avian flu the CDC can deploy if the virus begins spreading from person to person, and existing antiviral drugs, such as Tamiflu, can be used to treat bird flu in people, according to the CDC. “The public need not panic,” Miller said. “We’re still in the early stages of understanding it, but we’re on top of it.”Kaitlin SullivanKaitlin Sullivan is a contributor for NBCNews.com who has worked with NBC News Investigations.

When the cattle arrived in Michigan, they still showed no symptoms.Related:Fruit trees are budding, Michigan farmers are worried about crops freezingGroups sue Michigan wildlife regulators over shorter coyote hunting seasonFor Michigan farmers, danger is another part of the jobAs of Monday, the USDA had confirmed that cattle in seven dairy herds in Texas, two in Kansas and one in New Mexico had symptoms of highly pathogenic avian influenza. The agency said it also had received “presumptive positive test results” for a herd in Idaho."Our highest priorities at MDARD remain protecting our food supply and ensuring animal health,” said Tim Boring, director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development “As this situation evolves, we will provide critical updates to producers, industry and all Michiganders.”Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a virus that is spread when mammals come into contact with infected birds. It can also be spread from items that were exposed to the virus, like equipment, food or clothing.“This case does reflect a lot of what is already known about this virus—namely, that it is highly contagious, it continues to be primarily spread by wild birds and contact with infected animals, and mammals can contract the virus, " said Nora Wineland, state veterinarian.In Texas, an individual who came in contact with infected cattle has contracted the disease. Texas officials announced the case Monday, calling it the state’s first human case of novel avian influenza A (H5N1).Still, the probability of bird flu being spread to humans is very low, and transmission of the disease through pasteurized milk is highly unlikely, according to the USDA.Symptoms of highly pathogenic avian influenza in cattle include low appetite, decreased lactation and thickened milk.Health officials urge producers to take preventative measures to protect the animals on their farms and to contact their veterinarians if they are concerned about their animals’ health.If highly pathogenic avian influenza is suspected, individuals should immediately contact the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

To streamline recommendations, CDC has offered a uniform set of recommendations for the most common respiratory illnesses in the U.S. This update includes COVID-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. What setting is the new guidance intended for? The updated guidance is meant for general community settings and not for health care settings. CDC notes “there are no changes to respiratory virus guidance for health care settings.” What does the new guidance say? The updated recommendations say that if one falls ill with a respiratory virus, they should stay home and away from others (including others in the household who are not ill). They can return to normal activities when symptoms are improving and if they’ve been fever-free (without the aid of fever-reducing medications [e.g., acetaminophen]) for at least 24 hours. It should be noted that a fever is considered a measured temperature of >100.4 F (38 C), feeling warm to the touch with other symptoms or feeling feverish, per CDC. While an accurately measured temperature is the optimal method to determine fever, it is not always possible to take a person’s temperature. In the 5 days following resuming normal activities, people are encouraged to help decrease the spread of respiratory disease by wearing a well-fitting mask, keeping a distance from others, washing hands often and cleaning frequently touched surfaces. Enhanced infection control precautions are especially important to protect community members who are most at risk for severe illness (e.g., adults over 65, immunocompromised patients, pregnant people). The guidance also highlights that for those with COVID-19 or influenza, therapeuticsreatments are available and could reduce symptoms and risk of severe illness. Staying up to date with vaccinations can protect from serious illness, hospitalization and death. Visit the CDC website for updated respiratory virus guidance.

EU warns of potential spread to humans due to 'lack of immune defense’ Alert follows confirmation of rare human case in Texas By Melissa Rudy Fox News Published April 3, 2024 5:45pm EDT Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for April 3 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. As avian influenza (bird flu) continues to spread among wild birds in the European Union, officials are warning of the potential for a future human pandemic. On Wednesday, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued an alert noting that "transmission between bird and mammal species has been observed, particularly in fur animal farms, where outbreaks have been reported."Although it is rare for infected birds to pass along the virus to humans, the agency warned that new strains could pose a danger in the future. BABY SLEEP DANGERS REVEALED IN NEW STUDY AS NEARLY 75% OF INFANT DEATHS WERE DUE TO CO-SLEEPING "These viruses continue to evolve globally, and with the migration of wild birds, new strains carrying potential mutations for mammalian adaptation could be selected," the alert stated. "If avian A (H5N1) influenza viruses acquire the ability to spread efficiently among humans, large‐scale transmission could occur due to the lack of immune defenses against H5 viruses in humans." As avian influenza (bird flu) continues to spread among wild birds in the European Union, officials are warning of the potential for a future human pandemic. (iStock)In other words, humans don’t have immunity against bird flu — which means it could potentially spread quickly. The flu has been found to spread between birds and mammals, the EFSA noted — "particularly in fur animal farms, where outbreaks have been reported."US TUBERCULOSIS CASES IN 2023 WERE AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN A DECADE, CDC SAYS To prevent the risk of a bird flu pandemic, the agency recommended taking steps to limit exposure and prevent the spread to mammals and humans. "Key options for actions include enhancing surveillance targeting humans and animals, ensuring access to rapid diagnostics, promoting collaboration between animal and human sectors, and implementing preventive measures such as vaccination," the EFSA wrote. "People with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection," the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. (iStock)"Effective communication to different involved target audiences should be emphasized, as well as strengthening veterinary infrastructure, enforcing biosecurity measures at farms, and reducing wildlife contact with domestic animals."The agency also called for "careful planning of poultry and fur animal farming," particularly in locations with large numbers of waterfowl (aquatic birds like ducks and geese).Human cases in the U.S. On Monday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that a person in Texas tested positive for H5N1 bird flu."This person had exposure to dairy cattle in Texas presumed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses," the CDC’s statement said. CDC WARNS OF INVASIVE BACTERIAL OUTBREAK AMID SPIKE IN CASES AND FATALITY RATES: 'RARE BUT SEVERE' "The patient reported eye redness (consistent with conjunctivitis), as their only symptom, and is recovering. The patient was told to isolate and is being treated with an antiviral drug for flu." The CDC said this is the second case of a human testing positive for H5N1 in the U.S., after a previous case was observed in Colorado in 2022. "If avian A (H5N1) influenza viruses acquire the ability to spread efficiently among humans, large‐scale transmission could occur due to the lack of immune defenses against H5 viruses in humans," the European Food Safety Authority said. (iStock)"This infection does not change the H5N1 bird flu human health risk assessment for the U.S. general public, which CDC considers to be low," it added. "However, people with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other animals, are at greater risk of infection.""At present, it does not transmit readily from person to person." The CDC said it is "working with state health departments to continue to monitor workers who may have been in contact with infected or potentially infected birds/animals and test those people who develop symptoms." Human symptoms can range from mild (e.g., eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms) to severe illness (e.g., pneumonia), according to the CDC.Infectious diseases expert weighs in Erica Susky, a Toronto-based medical microbiologist certified in infection control, said she believes there is generally "not a high risk" of human-to-human transmission, given that "the natural reservoir" of H5N1 and other strains of avian influenza is birds and not humans."Cases of H5N1 in humans usually occur in people who have had contact with birds (slaughter, de-feathering, butchering or preparing)," she told Fox News Digital. The EU agency called for "careful planning of poultry and fur animal farming," particularly in locations with large numbers of waterfowl. (iStock) While bird flu has a 60% fatality in humans, Susky noted, it rarely occurs. "At present, it does not transmit readily from person to person," she said.The primary concern involves the influenza virus, she said, which is "excellent at mutating and recombining." "If there are repeated contacts between species that are the natural reservoir for one type of influenza viral strain — like birds and H5N1 — and humans, the chances of this novel strain adapting to spread in this different species increases," Susky told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER "As there are more cases of H5N1, there are more chances for a crossover event into humans."Some of the biggest sources of spread, Susky said, are industrial agriculture and modern cities, where a virus like influenza can pass readily through human and bird populations. "Currently, birds share influenza strains less often with humans, though that can change — it is how past influenza pandemics have arisen," she said. The CDC on Monday announced that a person in Texas tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo)To prevent spread, Susky recommended practicing proper infection prevention techniques, which is important not only for bird flu, but also for seasonal influenza. Those techniques include following proper and frequent hand hygiene before preparing food, eating or touching one’s face, and after using the washroom or coming in contact with animals. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOther mitigation strategies include receiving the annual influenza vaccine for those who qualify, and not going out among other people while feeling ill. "The best way to minimize one’s risk of coming in contact with novel influenza strains is to avoid contact with birds and wild animals, if possible," Susky added.

Though cows previously had been seen to be susceptible to human flu viruses, and could be experimentally infected with H5 in a lab, the absence of cow involvement until now in H5’s nearly 30-year history lulled scientists into thinking the species was outside the virus’s remit. Further elevating the concern this discovery has triggered is the fact that a dairy farm worker in Texas was infected with H5N1, though the unnamed individual’s only symptom was conjunctivitis.advertisement To put these developments in perspective, STAT turned to Dutch virologist Ron Fouchier, a leading expert on H5N1, for his assessment of these latest twists in the H5 saga. Fouchier, who studies avian influenza at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, was at the center of a controversy about H5N1 in 2012, when a U.S. scientific advisory group moved to restrict publication of research he and a team at the University of Wisconsin-Madison had done — separately — to see what mutations would be needed for the virus to be able to spread efficiently among people, so-called gain of function research. Fouchier takes little solace from the fact that current versions of H5N1 seem to infect people less frequently, and to cause mostly mild illness when they do. The global range of H5 viruses — the sheer volume of the virus in nature — and the numbers of mammals H5 has shown itself capable of sickening is unprecedented, he said, making anticipating its future path harder than ever to gauge.

It has been lightly edited for length and clarity.advertisement (Note: A zoonosis or zoonotic event is the infection of a person with an animal virus, in this case H5N1. Reassortment is a process by which flu viruses swap genes in an infected species, giving rise to hybrid viruses that could behave differently than their parent viruses.) Is it possible that we’ve seen H5N1 evolve to become more dangerous to a bunch of other species, but less dangerous to us? It’s what I’d like to think. In the years after the first human cases of infections in Hong Kong in 1997 right up to 2015, we saw relatively large numbers of zoonotic events with H5N1, ending in 2015, with very large numbers in Egypt. There were quite large numbers of human cases, despite restricted replication of the virus around the globe. Then, from 2014 onwards, the virus really started to spread massively with wild birds into Europe, crossing over into the U.S. two times now, also landing in Africa, spreading throughout Asia, all in wild migratory birds. We’ve never seen such big outbreaks all across Europe and the Americas. And we see the number of zoonotic events decrease. Related: What we know about H5N1 bird flu in cows — and the risk to humans You have massive outbreaks in wild birds. It spreads over into poultry quite easily. But in humans we see lower numbers, and that to me suggests that the zoonotic risk has decreased. And I am more or less supported by that by noticing that in the Western world — in England, in Russia, and in the U.S. — most of the [human] cases that we have seen were not particularly severe. After 2015, one thing that has happened is that these H5 viruses have continuously reassorted with wild bird avian influenza viruses. So what I think has happened is that these viruses are now better adapted to wild birds, but less adapted to poultry and to humans. That increases the environmental load of virus on occasion. There’s different species, time and time again, where you see massive bursts of virus. And carnivores, they feast on [dead birds]. It could also increase the environmental virus load on grasslands where birds poop or in surface waters. And that could increase the risk even to non-carnivorous mammals like goats or cows. STAT+ Connect: Get the scoop on H5N1 bird flu from a conversation between STAT’s Helen Branswell and Andrew Joseph. That kind of gives me a feeling of reassurance. It just provides an explanation where you wouldn’t have to really take into account yet an increased zoonotic risk. Of course, when we see this virus in a milking farm and you see incredibly high virus load in some milk cows and their milk, that is a new risk. Because I’m not sure how familiar you are with the milking procedures, but there’s very little that people do to prevent human contact with milk. During the milking process, there’s massive generation of aerosol formation. If you have high amounts of aerosol with virus, the chances increase that you will get conjunctivitis. There’s very little hygiene to protect the farmers that are milking. If people aren’t washing their hands a lot and somebody’s infected with conjunctivitis, you could see how that could spread, couldn’t you? When we had an outbreak of [H7N7] bird flu in the Netherlands in 2003, we had 89 cases of human infection. Is that when a veterinarian died? Yes. The majority of cases then were conjunctivitis cases. There were very few respiratory illnesses, except for that one fatal case. But the cases of conjunctivitis were linked to direct contact with poultry, and not with human-to-human transmission. There was only one investigation where two household members got conjunctivitis, and they shared a towel to wash their face. I think it is not very likely that you will see massive spread of conjunctivitis due to avian influenza. I don’t think that it’s likely that it will spread human to human. It’s more likely that it will spread from the animal source into humans. I think you disagreed earlier when I used the word “reassuring.” But to me this pattern of becoming much better at infecting wild birds, and seemingly less inclined to infect people seems reassuring. Well, let me explain why I don’t think it’s too reassuring. We have never seen this scale of infections in mammals, and in such diversity of mammals. We have now seen more than 40 species of mammals infected during the last outbreaks, which is unprecedented. We know that flu is unpredictable. But we also know that adaptation of virus to mammals is not a good thing. Related: H5N1 avian flu found in Texas individual who apparently was infected by dairy cows Many of the adaptive mutations that you see occur when H5 has infected marine mammals, or foxes or martens or minks have been seen with the viruses that caused previous human pandemics. And that I find not reassuring. And with 40 species happening at the same time all over the world, sometimes with little option to intervene, that is not so reassuring to me. What do you mean by options to intervene? Well, if there are infections in cows, we can offer personal protective equipment to the milkers and we can offer antiviral drugs to people who start to develop symptoms or conjunctivitis. But when tens of thousands of seals wash up on your shore, what are you going to do? And how are you going to prevent onward spread? And these are the animals that we see. What about the animals that we don’t see so easily, like rats or mice? What’s happening? The large species we now know get infected easily. But the small species, we don’t even know. And so the high presence in nature, and the large number of infections I find concerning, despite the fact that we think current zoonotic risk is low. And that’s because these viruses are changing. And we have no experience [of how H5 behaves] in all these species. We can’t predict what’s going to happen. One of the things H5 has taught me is that it’s ever-changing, and just because it seems to infect people less frequently right now, that doesn’t mean it’s always going to be that way. Also the fact that the first human now is diagnosed with conjunctivitis is not a guarantee. There’s a small chance that if you have an infection in the eye, that you will actually get virus also in your respiratory tract. And then we know that if the virus ends up in your lower airways, you could develop pneumonia. One case in a farmer who only develops conjunctivitis is not a reason to celebrate the fact that this virus is not virulent. Let’s be careful now, and monitor the people and treat them with drugs as soon as you see that there’s something more happening. What are you working on now? What are you looking for? I would like to know if there is indeed decreased zoonotic risk through the reassortment patterns. How do you investigate that question? We identified reassortment patterns. And then we take one of the earlier parental viruses that didn’t spread so well in wild birds and compare it to the current versions and inoculate different bird species, including ducks, or cell cultures. And you can look for all of the different variants, and how they vary in their replicative capacity in wild birds. We can inoculate human organoid cells and see how permissive the cells are to the different variants, whether the early Asian variants that caused many zoonoses, whether they were, in fact, more prone to infect human tissue than the current viruses. And if you see those same opposing patterns — so more adaptation to wild birds, less efficient in infecting human cells — that would explain the current situation compared to what we’ve seen before. But of course, it’s important to note that we’re all doing our research with our hands tied behind our back because of the gain-of-function issues. We have to be careful in what we do and how we design the experiments. So we can take natural viruses and show that the old viruses were less likely to infect wild birds and more likely to infect human cells, and the current virus is the other way around. But really getting to the bottom of things is getting harder and harder. Is there anything you’ve been waiting for a chance to say but I haven’t asked the right question to elicit it? Well, the questions are really about what’s going on with the cows. And U.S. scientists and officials are hopefully going to resolve that quickly. How does this virus enter cows? If there is cow-to-cow transmission, how does it work? It’s clear that it’s dairy cows, and it could be that it’s due to the milking instruments that do not get cleaned enough. It’s human driven cow-to-cow transmission. And if that’s the case, you can stop it. You can try to actually clean your machine. So I’m really looking forward to in-depth investigations, epidemiological investigations of how the cows get this disease. It could also be from a common feeding source. So what are these cows being fed? Do they eat fresh grass? Do they eat hay from a common source that has been contaminated by birds being out there? I think this is really crucial information, because this is going to lead to what are the options to stop this outbreak.

Edwin Remsberg via Getty Images Last week, officials announced that a number of dairy cows across 11 total herds in Texas, Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico have tested positive for the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, also known as bird flu. Now, the first human case of bird flu has been confirmed in Texas. Whereas the livestock are likely to have contracted the virus through contact with birds carrying the strain, the infected person became ill after exposure to sick cows—marking just the second human case of H5N1 in United States history and the first in the Lone Star state. The patient is reportedly doing well and being treated with an antiviral drug, according to a statement from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS). Eye inflammation—or pink eye—is their only current symptom, and they have been instructed to isolate to prevent further spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which conducted testing to confirm the single case, is not currently pursuing any further tests of humans who may have also been exposed, reports STAT News’ Helen Branswell. “We are not aware of reports that any of this individual’s close contacts have developed any symptoms,” Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, tells the publication. “The fact that there are not other samples cooking right now is reassuring, insofar as that we’re not aware of other individuals who are symptomatic following an exposure to livestock.” The CDC remains vigilant in looking for others who report H5N1-like symptoms, though the virus presents no known risk to the public at large. Meanwhile, officials continue to stress that the milk supply is safe. “The cattle infections do not present a concern for the commercial milk supply,” per the statement. “Dairies are required to destroy or divert milk from any sick cows, plus pasteurization kills avian flu viruses.” The person in Texas tested positive for the H5N1 strain after having contact with infected cattle, which are not pictured here. Iain Farrell via Flickr, under CC BY-ND 2.0 DEED Since avian flu spilled over into mammals, its potential to evolve and infect humans has remained a concerning unknown for scientists. Foxes, raccoons, sea lions, bears, minks and other mammals across the globe have contracted H5N1 and died. But up until last month, many scientists thought that livestock, such as dairy cows and goats, would not be susceptible to the strain. Now, it appears that mammal-to-mammal spread—from cow to cow, and potentially from cow to human—may be more probable than previously assumed. “How else could it move so rapidly?” Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch, tells the New York Times’ Emily Anthes and Apoorva Mandavilli. However, it remains possible that each cow independently contracted the virus from a bird, perhaps through contaminated food or water. Officials say the virus has shown no signs of evolving in a way that would make it spread easily among humans, per the New York Times. In the past 20 years, approximately 900 human cases of avian flu have been reported across 23 countries. Older strains were more aggressive in humans, but recent iterations have generally yielded milder symptoms and less frequent infections. In 2022, the first U.S. human case of the H5N1 strain was confirmed in a Colorado man working on a poultry farm. He reported feeling fatigued and later recovered. With the new case, health officials maintain that it is “extremely rare” for the virus to transmit between people, though they continue to approach the situation with caution. “On the positive side, it seems like this was a very mild case, and it’s the only case that’s been identified so far,” Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the Center for Pandemic Decision Science at the University of Texas at Austin, tells the Texas Tribune’s Neelam Bohra. “But at the same time, it seems like there’s quite a bit of this virus that has been detected in cattle populations. Anytime a virus jumps into a new species, especially a rapidly evolving virus like influenza—we need to be approaching it with the utmost caution and vigilance to make sure we really understand the situation.” Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.

FILE - Cows are milked on a large carousel at a dairy in Pickett, Wis., Dec. 4, 2019. The Oregon Department of Agriculture is working with its neighbors and several other state offices on a plan to respond if a suspected case of avian flu is reported in Oregon dairy cows.Morry Gash / APA handful of dairy cattle herds in at least five states, including Idaho, have tested positive for a strain of bird flu. Oregon Department of Agriculture officials say the agency is working with its neighbors and several other state offices on a plan to respond if a suspected case is reported in Oregon.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorOn March 25, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed a positive case of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, in two dairy herds in Texas and two in Kansas.A few days later the Idaho Department of Agriculture announced it detected a positive case of the virus in a dairy cattle operation in the southern region of the state. The findings mark the first time HPAI has been detected in dairy cattle, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorThe same bird flu strain has affected over 80 million poultry birds across the U.S. since 2022, including nearly 800,000 commercial chickens in Oregon. Chickens were so affected in recent years that the virus was blamed in part for skyrocketing egg and meat prices.Wild migratory birds are believed to be the source of infection for both poultry birds and the recent dairy cattle cases.Idaho officials said the affected facility recently imported cattle from another state that has identified cases of HPAI in dairy cattle, which suggests the virus may have been transmitted between cows.While no cases have been reported in Oregon, the state’s department of agriculture is working with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Health Authority and the USDA to update livestock producers and come up with a response plan, according to a statement from the agency.ODA is also telling producers to practice what it calls good biosecurity, like minimizing dairy livestock movements and isolating sick cows from the herd if they show symptoms like loss of appetite or a drop in milk production.At least one person in Texas has caught the virus after being exposed to dairy cattle presumed to be infected with the bird flu. Although it usually affects birds, occasionally the virus infects people, though it is extremely rare for it to be transmitted from one person to another, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The person in Texas experienced eye inflammation as their only symptom, and the case does not change the risk for the general public, which remains low, according to health officials.Unlike poultry infections, which are fatal, sick dairy cows tend to recover on their own, according to the USDA. Officials also said it’s still safe to drink milk since it’s pasteurized before being sold, although milk from impacted animals is being diverted or destroyed so that it does not enter the food supply.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a Sponsor📨 Stay informed after Election DayLearn what the election results will mean for the Pacific Northwest.

The infected flock was found at the company’s Green Meadow Organics facility in Ionia County. This is the fourth case of avian influenza in a commercial facility since the disease was first detected in the state in 2022, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said in a statement Tuesday.Sponsor The virus is deadly especially for chickens, as the mortality rate for infected hens is 90% to 100%, sometimes within 48 hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Related:Bird flu found in cattle on a dairy farm in central MichiganWolf killed in southern Michigan is first sighting in more than 100 yearsFruit trees are budding, Michigan farmers are worried about crops freezing“Over the weekend, our company veterinarian noticed sick birds at the facility and lab results confirmed our fears that Avian Influenza was present," Herbruck's Poultry Ranch CEO Greg Herbruck said in a statement to Michigan Farm News and other media outlets.“Our team worked quickly to implement protocols to protect the rest of our flocks — along with our longstanding biosecurity measures — including prohibiting movement between our Green Meadow Organics facility and other sites.” Green Meadow Organics is separate from the company’s main poultry farm.“Herbruck’s is heartbroken by the loss of any hen, and we were devastated to learn that some of the hens at our Green Meadow Organics facility are infected with highly pathogenic Avian Influenza,” Herbruck said in the statement. Bridge has reached out for additional comment.In the case of any outbreak, farmers are required to “depopulate” or kill the infected birds to prevent the disease from spreading to other birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “Once they depopulate then they're gonna have to disinfect … and then it can be several months before they're back up and producing at that farm again,” said Ernie Birchmeier, senior industry relations specialist for the Michigan Farm Bureau. Potential impact on egg pricesBirchmeier added that consumers could see a potential increase in the cost of eggs as the bird flu has impacted other commercial farms across the country. “There's not an automatic supply of new birds that go into a facility,” he said. “Those birds typically will need to be eggs, will need to be set and then hatched. The birds are going to need to grow up and it's going to take them several months before they're ready to start producing eggs.”As of Wednesday, bird flu had been detected in three commercial flocks and seven backyard flocks across the U.S. in a 30-day period, affecting 3.85 million birds, according to the USDA. The other two commercial flocks are in Texas and South Dakota. "Michigan's egg farmers are among the most proactive in the country, with their diligence leading to rapid detection of HPAI in this flock," said Dr. Nancy Barr, executive director of Michigan Allied Poultry Industries. "Strict biosecurity measures are in place to protect flocks from the increased threat of HPAI."Sponsor News of the infected hen at Herbruck’s comes days after the Michigan agriculture officials confirmed the virus in cattle in Montcalm County. State officials said the source of the spread was from infected cattle coming from Texas. “As the weather remains cool and wild birds continue their migration, conditions are ideal for the virus to thrive and spread,” said Dr. Nora Wineland, state veterinarian. "Keeping HPAI out of Michigan’s domestic animals remains a team effort, and it must be a top priority for all."The virus is not only spread directly from infected birds but can also be contracted by touching equipment or clothing exposed to the virus.

Advertisement Since the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (or, bird flu) reached cows and hens, there have been concerns about the safety of produce, and whether Americans should avoid certain foods.The USDA said that as of now, there is no concern that this should pose a risk to consumers. At the same time, it noted that this is a "rapidly evolving situation."The USDA reported cases of HPAI in cattle herds across multiple states on March 25. As of Tuesday, that virus had reached chickens in Texas, Cal-Maine Foods announced, "resulting in the depopulation of approximately 1.6 million laying hens" as a precaution. Advertisement Dr. Samuel Alcaine, an associate professor of food science at Cornell University, said the USDA and CDC have been tracking avian flu for a while now, but the recent detection of it in cows is a new development."Overall, I don't think there's a significantly increased risk to the US consumer as long as they're already following the basic food safety practices that we should be following at home anyways," he said.Still, he shared the measures you can take to stay safe. Advertisement Most animal products are safe to eatThe US agriculture industry has strict protocols about quarantining sick animals so as not to spread the virus, The New York Times reported.Additionally, most commercial animal products, such as milk, cheese, and liquid eggs (egg yolks) go through a pasteurization process.Alcaine said that according to existing research on the avian flu, "the temperatures that we use for pasteurization are more than adequate to inactivate the virus." Advertisement Embrace firm egg yolksTo be extra safe, fully cook your meat and eggs, said Alcaine. Just as you would to prevent salmonella or E.coli infections, you should cook meat and eggs at hot-enough temperatures to prevent illness. Related stories According to the CDC's salmonella guidelines, you'll want to cook eggs until both the egg and yolk are firm, such as hard-boiled or scrambled eggs. (You can also use pasteurized eggs if you're craving them poached.)Cook meat to the right internal temperatureFor meat, the CDC recommends cooking ground meats to 160°F and poultry to 165°F. Advertisement Additionally, Alcaine said you'll want to be wary of cross-contamination, such as keeping the utensils used to handle raw meat and eggs away from cooked food.Raw animal products can carry bacteriaMost states require dairy products to be pasteurized, and any products that cross state lines must be pasteurized by federal law, Dr. Sumiko Mekaru, the vice president of research & innovation at PHC Global, a bio risk threat intelligence platform provider, told ABC News.However, some states allow the sale of raw milk and unpasteurized cheese, which have been growing in popularity over recent years. Advertisement While Alcaine said that there's no evidence yet that this particular virus is spread through eating raw food, "we do know that things like raw milk also have issues with salmonella and listeria contamination."In general, drinking raw milk can lead to side effects like vomiting and diarrhea, and just to be safe, the CDC also suggests abstaining in light of this recent outbreak.

Video Ad Feedback (2017) What is bird flu? 01:12 - Source: CNN CNN — Bird flu is affecting a growing number of cattle herds in the US, and these infections have led to only the second known human case in the nation, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There has been no human-to-human spread in the US, but there have been sporadic cases of people sharing the bird flu virus in other parts of the world, so the CDC says it is watching the situation closely. Like all viruses, H5N1 has the potential to mutate to become more of a threat to humans. “The risk overall for the general public remains low,” Dr. Nirav D. Shah, the agency’s principal deputy director, said Wednesday. “But make no mistake, the CDC is activated as a result of these findings. We are taking this situation extremely, extremely seriously and are actively engaged in making sure that the public health response is robust.” yipengge/iStockphoto/Getty Images Related article Egg prices are rising again. An outbreak of bird flu could make things worse The risk is considered low, in part, because when humans have caught this version of the virus, it’s typically those who have close contact with sick animals. The infections usually stop there. “So it may go from a bird or a chicken to a human, and that human may indeed pass it on to a spouse, for example, but what we don’t see thereafter is sustained transmission from human to human,” Shah said. The latest case – in a person in Texas who had exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected – was mild, officials said, but humans can get severely ill and die from the disease. “So even though we haven’t seen sustained transmission, we take this seriously, and that’s why the CDC has sprung into action,” Shah said. Shah said the agency and its local public health partners have been watching out for anyone who may have interacted with these herds and may have bird flu symptoms. They are testing only people with potential symptoms because of a concern over false positives. About 15 people have been tested in this outbreak, the CDC says, and only one had the virus. The Texas patient’s only symptom was red eyes, and the CDC notes that it is not one typically associated with this flu, which more often causes a cough, fever or shortness of breath.

Cynthia Goldsmith/CDC Related article CDC confirms second reported case of bird flu in a person in the US “In this respect, we want to be testing more people rather than fewer people, so that’s why we went ahead and greenlit the testing for anybody with symptoms who have been exposed,” Shah said. Doctors treated the Texas patient with an antiviral medication commonly used for the more familiar flu virus, and the person went into isolation. If the virus does mutate and spread among humans, the CDC said, it is prepared and can use existing products to detect and protect against it. The strain that was recovered from the latest person who was sick is the same version as in the sick cows and as has been circulating in birds. “We have not seen any changes to the genome that would suggest a reduced effectiveness of either vaccines, [the antiviral drug] Tamiflu or diagnostic tests,” Shah said. Scientists discovered the first cows sick with the virus in two dairies in Texas in March, the first cows known to be infected with bird flu. More humans may have been exposed to the virus since the US Department of Agriculture said Monday that it had detected the flu in a herd of dairy cows in New Mexico and five additional dairy herds in Texas. This was the first time the virus had been found in cows in New Mexico. In total, seven herds have been affected by bird flu in Texas, two in Kansas, one in Michigan and one in New Mexico, the USDA said. It is also suspected in a herd in Idaho, but those test results are still being analyzed. This picture shows a Falkland Skua. Kneonlight/iStockphoto/Getty Images Related article Bird flu detected in Antarctic for the first time, British Antarctic Survey says Since the start of this outbreak of bird flu in January 2022, more than 82 million poultry in 48 states have been affected, according to the CDC. Cases were also detected in 9,253 wild birds, although the true number is probably much higher. The virus has shown up in relatively fewer mammals, although those numbers have also been growing. Baby goats, ducks, geese, deer, foxes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, pet cats and other animals have tested positive. Watching the virus jump to cows has been a concern, said Dr. Thomas Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “It is important whenever there’s a change – and this is a change that cattle are infected for the first time that we know about, and this is only the second human case in the US that’s been detected – every time there’s such a change, we need to dig into that and make sure there’s nothing more than just a single one-off case from industrial exposure,” he said. Shah said people shouldn’t be alarmed by the official name for the virus: highly pathogenic avian influenza. “That name, in and of itself, may raise the blood pressure of many people who are reading or watching. The ‘highly pathogenic’ part of the name refers to its virulence and severity in birds, not humans,” he said. “Indeed, if you are a migratory bird, this virus is bad news.” A California condor takes flight on June 21, 2017 in the Ventana Wilderness east of Big Sur, California. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP/FILE Related article USDA takes steps toward vaccinating endangered California condors against bird flu Ducks and geese can carry the virus without appearing sick, but poultry aren’t always so lucky. Highly pathogenic avian influenza carries “very high mortality rates” among chickens and turkeys, and farmers are concerned because it has continued to spread despite their best efforts to contain it. Because the virus spreads easily and can kill birds quickly, farmers usually have to cull even uninfected birds to prevent a wider outbreak. On Tuesday, Michigan reported cases in a commercial poultry facility. On Wednesday, the nation’s largest egg producer found bird flu in a Texas facility. Cal-Maine Foods said it will have to depopulate 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets at its Texas facility, according to state Department of Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, who called it “absolutely devastating news for Cal-Marine and the entire Panhandle region, which has already suffered so much already.” People who work with sick birds have had to take precautions, Inglesby said, but everyone doesn’t have to get rid of their bird feeders. Studies have shown that bird flu may spread to songbirds, but the ones that typically gather at feeders – such as cardinals, sparrows and blue birds – and those you may see on the street like pigeons and crows do not typically carry bird flu viruses that would be a threat to humans, according to the CDC. However, “it’s always a good idea to wash your hands when you’re interacting with wild birds,” Inglesby said. ACTON, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 05: Rescued chickens gather in an aviary at Farm Sanctuary's Southern California Sanctuary on October 5, 2022 in Acton, California. A wave of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu has now entered Southern California as the fall bird migration sets in, raising concerns for wild birds and poultry farms in the region. Farm Sanctuary is home to rescued chickens, turkeys, cows, pigs and other farm animals.

Based on current knowledge, ranchers do not have to kill sick cows, Shah said. None of the cows in the sick herds have died from the infection as of Wednesday, he said. The cows probably caught the virus when they encountered wild migratory birds; however, the USDA’s Animal Plant Health Inspection Service said it couldn’t rule out cow-to-cow transmission, based on the spread of the illness among a herd in Michigan. The virus didn’t appear to have any kind of respiratory transmission but more likely spread through infected milk. “That appears to be the leading theory at this point,” Inglesby said. Although the virus can be found in high concentrations in milk from sick cows, it does not pose a threat to humans who drink milk or eat dairy products because most milk in the US is pasteurized and has to be so in order to be sold across state lines. The pasteurization process inactivates viruses before the product can go to market. The US Food and Drug Administration continues to remind people that raw milk can pose a serious health risk to those who drink it.

Now what we’ve done is add an asterisk to that and said, ‘and we really mean it,’ ” Shah said. Typically, the US has higher production of milk in the spring, the USDA said, and the infections in cows shouldn’t hurt the nation’s food supply. The agency says the milk lost from symptomatic cattle to date is “too limited” to have a major impact and shouldn’t impact the price of milk. The USDA and the CDC said they will continue working with the industry and with local public health departments to monitor the situation and to encourage vets and farmers to report sick animals quickly so the impact of the virus can be limited.

A previous version of this story stated that the herd's positive test results for bird flu were still pending.In late March, bird flu was reported in dairy cattle for the first time. Since then, a human and more than 1 million chickens have been added to the count of positive cases in the United States. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed on March 25 the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI, in two dairy herds in Texas and two dairy herds in Kansas that had cattle exhibiting symptoms of the disease, according to the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. This came after the detection of bird flu in juvenile goats on a Minnesota farm where poultry had recently contracted the virus, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.By March 29, the USDA announced that their National Veterinary Services Laboratories also confirmed the presence of HPAI in a Michigan dairy herd that recently received cows from Texas. On April 1, the USDA and APHIS confirmed the detection of HPAI in a dairy herd in New Mexico and five additional dairy herds in Texas, followed by the April 2 confirmation of HPAI in a dairy herd in Idaho. These cases mark the first time that bird flu has been detected in dairy cattle and the second time the virus has been detected in a ruminant, herbivorous grazing or browsing artiodactyls, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. What is bird flu? Avian flu, a disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted among birds, affects more than 100 bird species and spreads quickly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The two groups of avian influenza viruses are low pathogenicity avian influenza, LPAI, which is often seen in wild birds, and HPAI, found mostly in domestic poultry. LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease while HPAI causes severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds, according to the CDC. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds and can infect domestic poultry and other bird animal species. Infected birds can shed avian influenza A viruses in their saliva, feces and nasal secretions. Susceptible birds become infected when they have contact with the virus as it is shed by birds or through contact with surfaces contaminated with the virus from infected birds. Both LPAI and HPAI A viruses have caused mild to severe illness in infected humans, according to the CDC. How many herds of dairy cattle have contracted bird flu? To date, the USDA has confirmed the detection of HPAI in seven dairy herds in Texas, two in Kansas and one in Michigan, New Mexico and Idaho each. Texas man tests positive for bird flu On April 1, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported a human case of bird flu in Texas.The infected man is identified as a person who had direct exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected with the disease. Before bird flu testing the week prior, the man’s only reported symptom was eye inflammation. At this time, the man is being treated with oseltamivir, an antiviral drug. The Texas Department of State Health Services says the man’s positive case of bird flu does not change the risk for the general public, which remains low. The CDC reports that this is only the second human case of H5N1 flu in the U.S. and the first linked to an exposure to cattle. Bird flu spreads to chickens On April 2, Cal-Maine Foods Inc., the country’s largest producer of fresh eggs, announced the detection of bird flu at one of its facilities in Parmer County, Texas.The positive detection of HPAI resulted in the culling (selective slaughtering) of approximately 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets (a hen that is less than one year old), about 3.6% of the company’s total flock as of March 2, the Mississippi-based company announced.Due to the cases of bird flu, production at the facility has been temporarily halted as Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. follows USDA protocols to remedy the issue. The company is working to secure production from other facilities to minimize consumer disruption, a statement said. Details on bird flu, Delaware cattle: Herds of dairy cattle have tested positive for bird flu. Will milk, dairy prices go up?What do bird flu cases mean for dairy prices? “There continues to be no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply because products are pasteurized before entering the market, or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health,” said the USDA. Dairies are required to send only milk from healthy animals into processing for human consumption and milk from impacted animals is being “diverted or destroyed so it does not enter the human food supply.” The USDA adds that pasteurization continues to remain efficient at inactivating bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk. Pasteurization is required for any milk entering interstate commerce for human consumption, the agency said. The USDA continues to promote the hazards of drinking unpasteurized, raw milk, which can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious health risks to consumers, and recommends that the industry does not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw/unpasteurized milk cheese products made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness. “Milk loss resulting from symptomatic cattle to date is too limited to have a major impact on supply and there should be no impact on the price of milk or other dairy products,” said the USDA. “Further, the U.S. typically has a more than sufficient milk supply in the spring months due to seasonally higher production.” The USDA reports that the FDA is not aware that any milk or food products from symptomatic cows is entering interstate commerce. Milk from infected cows being used to feed calves is recommended to be heat-treated to kill harmful bacteria and viruses before calf feeding. What do bird flu cases mean for egg prices? As for eggs, a person cannot contract bird flu from eggs that are cooked and stored properly, according to the CDC. According to the FDA, the likelihood that eggs from infected poultry are found in the retail market is low, and proper storage and preparation further reduce the risk, due to the safeguards in place when HPAI is detected in the U.S. and the rapid onset of symptoms in positive cases.Cooking poultry, eggs and other animal products to the proper temperature and preventing cross-contamination between raw and cooked food are key ways to prevent any food safety hazard, said the FDA, and continuing to practice safe cooking techniques remains advised. In late 2022, avian influenza severely impacted chicken farmers, and consumers, in what was known as “eggflation.” Fifty-eight million birds across 47 states were impacted, according to the USDA, and as of February of 2023, commercial layer facilities reported egg supply that was reduced by around 7.5% per month. The average cost of egg prices in December of 2022 was $4.90 as a result, a 70% increase from the year before. Bird flu impact on Delaware cattle On April 2, the Delaware Department of Agriculture issued a control order restricting the movement of dairy cattle into Delaware.The order states that: No dairy cattle from an affected herd, as described above, shall be allowed to move into Delaware until further notice. If any cattle from an affected premises exhibit these signs, all cattle on the premises shall be restricted. Dairy cattle outside the Delmarva Peninsula require a signed health certificate within 48 hours of entry. Upon arrival, all dairy cattle will be quarantined for 30 days. Got a tip or a story idea?

Scientists are on high alert. But many say what worries them more is whether this virus will jump to more livestock — and pigs, in particular. (Ohio Department of Agriculture)Social SharingOn March 25, American officials published an urgent announcement: Dairy cows in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico were falling sick.The cows had low appetites, and produced less milk than normal. Some farms also discovered wild bird carcasses on their grounds. Tests on a cow throat swab and raw milk samples all confirmed an unusual finding: for the first time, cattle were catching a dangerous form of bird flu.Within days, highly pathogenic avian flu — a type of influenza A known as H5N1 — was identified in at least a dozen herds across six states, from Texas in the south, up to Michigan and Idaho on the Canadian border.Louise Moncla, an avian influenza researcher and assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, was stunned. "The overwhelming feeling that all of us have is that this is mostly just incredibly strange," she said. "To our knowledge, I've never seen a cow be infected with any influenza A viruses."But the curveball wasn't entirely unexpected. And it may be a harbinger of more species-jumps to come, including the rising possibility of H5N1 appearing in pigs — which could offer it a new route to better adapt to infect humans, inching the world closer to a bird flu pandemic.Various species getting infectedOver the last two decades, this deadly form of bird flu began striking more and more wild and farmed bird species. The threat exploded in 2022 with tens of millions of global bird deaths. And a rising number of mammals are also getting infected, from mink to seals to domestic dogs and cats.This March, prior to the discovery of cases among cattle, Minnesota reported an H5N1 infection in a young goat, marking the first known U.S. case of bird flu in a ruminant. (Cows are also ruminants, a group of herbivores known for their four-chambered stomachs.) Do you have a question about food safety and H5N1? Send an email to ask@cbc.ca. Sporadic human cases — and deaths — are also occurring around the world. The second-ever human infection in the U.S. was reported just days ago in Texas, in an individual with mild symptoms who'd had direct exposure to cattle.Person diagnosed with bird flu in Texas after contact with cowsA somewhat reassuring genomic sequencing analysis from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found only "minor changes" between viral sequences from cattle and the virus sequence from the human patient. And in both cases, the sequences largely lacked any changes suggesting the virus had better adapted to infect mammals."There is no evidence at this time that this virus is some sort of new, adapted strain that's transmitting really efficiently in cows," Moncla said.The genome for the human case did feature one genetic tweak that signals adaptation to mammals — but the CDC stressed there wasn't evidence the virus had transmitted onward to other people.Still, such rapid spread among dairy cattle herds, alongside other recent infections reported in U.S. farm cats, poultry, and the country's latest human case, all has scientists and health officials on high alert.Bird flu keeps spreading beyond birds. Scientists worry it signals a growing threat to humans, too"Dairy cows have not been affected before in the United States, or anywhere else in the world to my knowledge, and we've never before seen such clear evidence of mammal-to-mammal transmission," said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore.That possibility of spread between cows "does take us, maybe, a half-step closer to a scenario where the virus would be better adapted for humans," she told CBC News.What's even more concerning, several researchers agreed, is the growing potential for bird flu to spread to another species of livestock: Pigs.WATCH | Human bird flu case linked to U.S. dairy cattle outbreaks:Human bird flu case linked to U.S. dairy cattle outbreaks7 months agoDuration 2:32A person in Texas who had close contact with infected dairy cattle has been diagnosed with bird flu. It's the country's second known human case after the virus was discovered circulating among dairy cows across at least four U.S. states for the first time.Pigs considered viral mixing vesselsWhile cattle aren't known for being an ideal host for many flu viruses, pigs are potent viral mixing vessels. That's because swine have both human-adapted receptors and avian-adapted receptors in their respiratory tracts, Moncla said, meaning they can be infected with either type of pathogen.If a pig catches both a human influenza A virus and an avian influenza A virus at the same time, it can spark a process known as viral reassortment — a genetic exchange in which flu viruses swap gene segments. The birds are back in town. Spring migration could fuel spread, evolution of avian flu, scientists warnThose swaps can introduce dramatic changes, producing a new virus with certain properties of a non-human strain coupled with the capacity to infect and spread between people.That sort of shift hasn't been documented yet with H5N1. But it did happen with a new form of H1N1 — a virus resulting from a mashup of genes between various pig, bird, and human flu viruses — which began infecting people for the first time in 2009, sparking a pandemic.Death rates from H1N1 were higher than typical flu seasons, but it eventually began circulating alongside other seasonal flu viruses and is now included in annual flu shots.Vaccine makers prep bird flu shot for humans 'just in case' as rich nations lock in suppliesMoncla said her "worst fear" is something similar happening with highly pathogenic avian flu, given its health impacts. The death rate in humans may be upwards of 50 per cent, World Health Organization data suggests, though it's possible that milder infections are getting missed, skewing the case fatality ratio. Still, in a population that's never been exposed, the global impacts could be dire."Absolutely nobody wants to go through another pandemic — and it would be terrible," Moncla said.Government workers wear protective gear to collect poultry for slaughter during an outbreak of avian influenza on the Ivory Coast. (Legnan Koula/EPA-EFE)'It might not ever leave'There are no signals that H5N1 has spread to pigs, at least for now. It also hasn't appeared yet in Canadian livestock, including dairy cattle, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. But scientists on both sides of the border worry it's just a matter of time if swift action isn't taken to contain outbreaks and heighten surveillance.In Ontario, worries of an even deadlier pandemic start with chickens"The more that we can be doing to prepare now, just in case, the faster our reaction will be, and the more likely we will be to get ahead of the virus," said Rivers. That includes dusting off pandemic plans and updating emergency flu vaccine stockpiles, she said, since the time between the first human cluster of cases and widespread transmission could be a "very short window."Increased surveillance is also essential, along with serology studies to find out if other cattle herds have been unknowingly impacted, said Dr. Joe Armstrong, a veterinarian with the University of Minnesota who regularly travels the state to educate dairy and beef producers.Armstrong warned the outbreaks may already be bigger — and tougher to track — than they initially appeared.Second OpinionHow deadly bird flu sparked explosive outbreaks in 2022 — and why it matters for global healthDairy producers, scared for their livelihoods, can be wary of reporting sick cattle, given poultry producers are often forced to cull entire flocks experiencing H5N1 outbreaks, Armstrong said.More human cases could also be happening under the radar among farm workers who've moved to the U.S. from abroad, don't speak English as their first language, and may be hesitant to seek medical help, he added."So I think there's probably underreporting on both sides," Armstrong said. "If [H5N1] gets into a population where there's constantly animals going in and out … it might not ever leave."ABOUT THE AUTHORLauren PelleySenior Health & Medical ReporterLauren Pelley covers the global spread of infectious diseases, pandemic preparedness and the crucial intersection between health and climate change.

The presence of HPAI prompted the depopulation of around 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets, accounting for roughly 3.6% of the company’s total flock as of March 2, 2024. Production at the affected facility has halted temporarily as Cal-Maine Foods adheres to USDA protocols. The company is actively seeking production alternatives from other facilities to minimize customer disruption. No eggs or associated products have been recalled as part of this issue, but eggs must be properly cooked, as noted by the United States Department of Agriculture. This news comes close on the heels of a case of Avian flu infecting cattle and then a human being in Texas. A key symptom of contracting Avian flu is eye redness. Despite Cal-Maine Foods’ commitment to stringent biosecurity measures across its locations, the threat of HPAI remains unpredictable. The virus persists within the wild bird population, posing a heightened risk during migration seasons. While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assesses the human health risk from HPAI viruses as low, the USDA confirms that properly handled and cooked eggs do not transmit HPAI. Consequently, there is no known risk associated with eggs currently in circulation. Cal-Maine Foods collaborates closely with federal, state, and local authorities, as well as industry stakeholders, to mitigate future outbreak risks and manage responses effectively. The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and individual states monitor and publicly report incidents of HPAI by location.

US News Bird flu pandemic could be ‘100 times worse’ than COVID, scientists warn By Melissa Koenig Published April 4, 2024, 9:48 a.m. ET A bird flu pandemic with the potential to be “100 times worse than COVID” may be on the horizon after a rare human case was discovered in Texas, experts have warned. The H5N1 avian flu has spread rapidly since a new strain was detected in 2020, affecting wild birds in every state, as well as in commercial poultry and backyard flocks. But it has now even been detected in mammals, with cattle herds across four states becoming infected, and on Monday, federal health officials announced that a dairy worker in Texas caught the virus. “This virus [has been] on the top of the pandemic list for many, many years and probably decades,” Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi, a bird flu researcher from Pittsburgh, said at a recent panel discussing the issue, according to the Daily Mail. “And now we’re getting dangerously close to this virus potentially causing a pandemic.” 4 The H5N1 bird flu is spreading rapidly across mammals and has even infected a dairy worker in Texas. via REUTERS Explore More Trump set to select Sen. Marco Rubio to serve as secretary of state in historic appointment: report Sean 'Diddy' Combs housed in low-security jail dorm alongside SBF— where inmates can spy on female convicts: sources Melania Trump declines to meet with Jill Biden at White House, citing Mar-a-Lago raid: source He noted that the H5N1 virus has already been detected in species throughout the world and “has shown the ability to infect a range of mammalian hosts, including humans.” “So therefore, in my view, I think this is a virus that has the greatest pandemic threat [that is] playing out in plain sight and globally present,” Kuchipudi said. John Fulton, a pharmaceutical industry consultant for vaccines and the founder of Canada-based BioNiagara who organized the meeting, also expressed his concerns, the Mail reports. “This appears to be 100 times worse than COVID — or it could be if it mutates and maintains its high case fatality rate,” he said. “Once it’s mutated to infect humans, we can only hope that the [fatality rate] drops.” 4 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has maintained that the threat to humans is low. REUTERS Around 52% of humans who have contracted H5N1 since 2003 have died, according to the World Health Organization. For comparison, COVID currently kills less than 0.1% of those it infects — though at the start of the pandemic, the fatality rate was around 20%. Symptoms of the bird flu are similar to those of other flus, including cough, body aches and fever. Some people may not develop noticeable symptoms, but others can develop severe, life-threatening pneumonia. The dairy worker in Texas who was infected has reported “eye redness (consistent with conjunctivitis)” as their only symptom, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted. “The patient was told to isolate and is being treated with an antiviral drug for [the] flu,” the CDC said. 4 Around 52% of humans who have contracted H5N1 since 2003 have died, according to the World Health Organization. REUTERS The agency and “the whole U.S. government is taking this situation very seriously,” CDC Director Mandy Cohen told the Washington Post. She maintained that the virus does not pose much of a risk to the general public, noting that the dairy worker was in direct contact with infected cattle, and the US Department of Agriculture has said there are currently no changes that would make it more transmissible to humans. “While cases among humans in direct contact with infected animals are possible, this indicates that the current risk to the public remains low,” the department said in a statement over the weekend. But the fact that the virus has been found in cattle could mean it is starting to mutate, Cohen told the Washington Post. “We had not seen avian flu in cattle prior to last week. That is new,” she said. “It is a reservoir for [the] virus to circulate and potentially change.” If the virus does mutate enough to infect humans, it could spread rapidly, the European Food Safety Authority warned on Wednesday, according to Fox News. “If avian A [H5N1] influenza viruses acquire the ability to spread efficiently among humans, large-scale transmission could occur due to the lack of immune defenses against H5 viruses in humans,” the Food Safety Authority said. 4 The United States is already testing components used to create a vaccine for the virus. REUTERS To prevent any potential spread, the US is already testing components used to create a vaccine for the virus, and two candidate vaccine viruses appear to be well-matched to protect against H5N1, the Washington Post reports. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also said the Biden administration is monitoring the threat. “We take the health and safety of the American people seriously,” she said at her briefing on Wednesday. “It is very important to this president. “Our top priority is to keep communities healthy, safe and informed.” With Post wires Filed under bird flu cdc Pandemics viruses 4/4/24 Read Next Biden White House close to finalizing menthol cigarette ba...

State officials were notified when the cattle began exhibiting symptoms similar to herds infected with bird flu in other states. Most sick cows recover within a few days, according to the Ohio Department of Agriculture.This H5N1 strain of bird flu, among the deadliest forms according to the Associated Press, has been found in dairy cows in Texas, Kansas, Idaho, New Mexico and Michigan.State and federal public health officials are continuing to assess risks. The public health risk from bird flu remains low, according to the Food and Drug Administration.A person in Texas tested positive for bird flu on Monday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been no confirmed cases in Ohio residents.What is bird flu? Bird flu is a disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted among birds.Avian influenza viruses, according to the CDC and the USDA, are classified into two groups: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI, often seen in wild birds) and HPAI, found mostly in domestic poultry. According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, while HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds.Bird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds were slaughtered last year to limit the spread of the virus.More: Ohio cattle test positive for bird flu.

April 2024. An international team of scientists examining the presence and impact of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza of the H5 subtype (HPAIV H5) infections on Antarctic wildlife have identified further spread of the virus in the Northern Weddell Sea area of Antarctica. The team found that so far skuas have been the most severely affected species, and the high mortality levels detected show there may be long-term consequences for their conservation at the regional level.The expedition, primarily funded by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), as well as the EU Horizon Europe project Kappa-Flu* and the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), set out to investigate the region of the Trinity Peninsula and the Northern Weddell Sea on the 13th of March. The current HPAIV H5 of interest initially evolved in poultry, but has recently adapted to better spread in wildlife. Since 2020, its unprecedented spread has caused significant mortalities of wild birds and mammals on an almost global scale. Following the arrival of HPAIV H5 to South America by the end of 2022, its arrival to Antarctica was predicted to occur in subsequent years, and finally confirmed in February 2024. There are great concerns on its effects on wildlife populations in Antarctica specifically, as several species are already classified from near threatened to critically endangered. In addition, the high wildlife mortality, as observed on other continents like South America, could easily go unnoticed here due to the remoteness and limited accessibility for regular surveillance of the Antarctic continent. ‘For this reason, setting up surveillance tools that are feasible within an Antarctic context could help in monitoring HPAIV H5 impact in upcoming years’, Meagan Dewar, leader of the expedition, stated. The specialists involved in this expedition were multidisciplinary, involving biologists, wildlife veterinarians, virologists and a seasoned Antarctic sailing crew. This team was well equipped to move fast from suspicion to sampling, and testing. They set out to investigate the region of the Trinity Peninsula and the Northern Weddell Sea, an area where previous surveillance efforts by National Antarctic Programs had been limited, but where the SCAR’s (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research) - Antarctic Wildlife Health Network (AWHN) had received notifications from researchers, ornithologists and the general public on potential mortality events or disease in wildlife. Once at the location, the team performed a preliminary assessment of sick individuals or unusual wildlife mortality, and then set out to collect samples for HPAIV H5 testing. In addition to collecting non-invasive samples from sick or ill individuals, hundreds of faecal samples were also collected from seemingly healthy animals, to investigate virus prevalence in those. Additionally, air and water samples were collected and will help determine virus presence in the environment. A compact diagnostic laboratory set up on the vessel specifically for this expedition, allowed the team to use state-of-the-art methods to test inactivated virus samples to then detect HPAIV H5 and sequence the genome. This on-ship testing, never performed before, represents a remarkable logistical advancement for HPAIV H5 surveillance in the Antarctic region, as confirmation did not depend on time-consuming shipment of samples to far off testing sites. During the expedition, the team surveyed 10 wildlife-dense areas located between the South Shetland Islands, the Northern Weddell Sea and the Danger Islands. The presence of HPAIV H5 was confirmed by multiple laboratory tests (H5-specific RT-qPCR and sequencing of the multibasic protease cleavage site characteristic for HPAIV) in skua carcasses at four landing sites (Hope Bay**, Devil Island, Paulet Island and Beak Island). Virus was detected in several sample types including the brain, suggesting neurotropism of the HPAIV H5 infection in this species.Of the sites visited, Beak Island stood out, as it has a large skua breeding colony. While 80 live skuas were present here at the time of the visit, more than 50 skuas were found dead. Of these 50 skuas (involving Brown Skuas and South Polar Skuas), 10 were tested and all 10 were confirmed positive for HPAIV H5. In one other site (Heroina Island), unusually high numbers of skua carcasses were also detected, however the virus could not be detected in those carcasses. Besides skua mortality, at two sites (Heroina Island and Beagle Island), the team detected an unusually high number of dead Adélie penguins. At Heroina’s main landing site, just a small proportion of the island, 532 Adélie carcasses were counted, of which a substantial number (172) were adults. Extrapolating these counts to the other sites of the island where the carcasses were also detected but not counted, mortality must have been several thousands. This high number, as well as the detection of so many adult carcasses, suggests an unusual mortality event had occurred here. Although the team suspected this to be caused by HPAIV H5, virus presence was not confirmed and further testing will be undertaken in the coming months to determine the cause of death. Samples of apparently healthy wildlife as well as an additional set of samples from carcasses will be tested soon at the institutes involved, using multiple additional techniques. These further analyses aim to acquire more information on virus presence in seemingly healthy animals and the genetics of the viruses detected. These data will help to understand how the virus has spread over time and place. In addition, tissues from infected carcasses will be analysed to understand how the virus causes disease and death and help to understand which tissues are best suited for virus detection.*KAPPA-FLU has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101084171.**Esperanza Station from Argentine Antarctic Institute (IAA)Participants of the Expedition: Meagan Dewar, Future Regions Research Centre, Federation University AustraliaAnne Günther, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, GermanyAntonio Alcamí, CSIC (Spanish National Research Council), SpainBegoña Aguado, CSIC (Spanish National Research Council), SpainFlorencia Soto, Instituto de Biología de Organismos Marinos (IBIOMAR-CONICET), ArgentinaLineke Begeman, Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, the NetherlandsMatteo Iervolino, Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, the NetherlandsRalph Vanstreels, Karen C.

Here’s what Wisconsin farmers need to knowColleen Kottke Wisconsin State FarmerThroughout her entire career as a large animal veterinarian, Karen Jordan never thought she'd suspect bird flu when trying to diagnose a cow refusing to eat or experiencing a sudden drop in milk production."But here we are," said Jordan during a webinar hosted by NMPF and the National Dairy FARM Program discussing the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in dairy cattle in five states. "We're living history. We're dealing with an emerging economic disease dealing with a drop in milk production and possible future reproductive challenges as we continue to collect data."Just a week ago, animal health officials announced that a mystery illness that had been plaguing some dairy herds in the Texas panhandle, Kansas and New Mexico had been diagnosed as HPAI. Since then outbreaks of the disease have been reported in dairy herds in Idaho and Michigan.While animal health officials at the USDA have determined that the disease was introduced into dairy herds via infected wild birds, they have been scrambling to identify how the disease is being transmitted among the cows in the herd."We don't have a clear picture of the illness we're seeing as there are multiple pathways for the disease to spread," said Mark Lyons, DVM, director of ruminant health for USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the national incident coordinator for HPAI in dairy cattle. "However, we have confirmed lateral transmission in the Michigan dairy herd."According to Michigan State Veterinarian Nora Wineland, HPAI was detected in a dairy herd in Montcalm County, northeast of Grand Rapids. The farm recently received cattle from an affected area in the panhandle of Texas before the disease was detected in that herd."When the cattle were moved from Texas to Michigan they did not appear ill," Wineland stated. However, two weeks later the cattle began to show symptoms consistent with HPAI.The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) announced on Monday that a worker having direct contact with infected cows is believed to be infected with avian influenza and that the worker's primary symptom was conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye.This is just the second human case of the highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in the U.S.Federal and state officials concur that the risk to the general public is low.What we don't know about the outbreak of HPAI in dairy cattleWhile animal health officials have confirmed that the outbreak of HPAI commonly known as Bird Flu was introduced by infected wild birds and that cattle can spread the disease among one another, they are scrambling to connect the dots about transmission of the disease.Texas veterinarian Brandon Treichler has been on the front lines of the outbreak in the panhandle of Texas where 82% of the state's herds are located, and has conferred with a network of veterinarians and dairy producers dealing with HPAI."Many recognize that this is something we haven't seen before, and honestly didn't know what it was for quite awhile, just that we were dealing with something that was not normal," Treichler said. "We tried to treat this with antibiotics because we thought it was some kind of contagious mastitis. However, the medicine didn't seem to change the course of infection. Basically, we're treating the symptoms."While commercial poultry operations have braced themselves each year for the potential of HPAI outbreaks by employing stringent biosecurity measures year-round, bird flu wasn't on the radar of most dairy producers or large animal vets."We didn't factor in birds being a spreader of the disease we're facing today," said veterinarian Danelle Bickett-Weddle, who has contributed to the development of the Secure Milk and Beef Supply Plans.Bickett-Weddle said disease can enter a farm from many sources with the primary route being animals (including animals new to the herd) and animal products. Other factors include people, feed, water and bedding, vehicles and equipment as well as rodents, birds, flies and wildlife."Birds need shelter, water and feed access and many find those things at dairy farms," Bickett-Weddle said. "And it's really hard to get rid of them using non-lethal methods."How will this disease impact infected dairies?One of the most telling symptoms in dairy cows is the drastic fall-off in milk production. Treichler says the disease typically affects older cows in mid-lactation, he has seen some severe cases involving first lactation and fresh cows. Heifers, calves, youngstock and dry cows don't seem to be impacted."The severely affected cows producing 90-100 lbs. of milk per day will come in and look like a dry cow within hours," he said.Symptoms of loss of milk production, fever, lack of appetite and diarrhea usually last between 10-14 days. Secondary illnesses like pneumonia and mastitis may impact cows at this time."It takes about 30-45 days to see bulk tank somatic cell counts come down from pre-outbreak levels. I'm not suggesting that all of the cows will bounce back to pre-infection milk production levels," Treichler said. "Some of these cows won't make it back into production at all. Some will make enough milk just to pay their feed bill."Treichler says this outbreak is a significant economic event for impacted dairies."At a time when the economics of dairying is less than ideal, this is really going to hurt these dairies," he said. "Supportive care and secondary health issues also require treatment and management involving extra costs."The drop in milk production following an HPAI outbreak can vary from a loss of 4 to 20 lbs. per cow on a herd level, depending on the age of the herd and pre-outbreak production.Culling cows from the herd will occur in two waves, he said."There is some initial culls that occur from the worst impacted cows and those with secondary infections," Treichler said. "Then there's a second wave after we stop seeing clinical cases of cows that do not come back into milk. Since there's not enough heifers in the pipeline to cull all those low-producing animals, our goal is to hold them in the herd until they dry off and hope for luck in the next lactation after they calve."Cows weathering a severe infection may have additional challenges ahead. Right now, Treichler says many herds are not far enough through the progression to know the true effects of fertility issues."We have seen a slightly increased level of abortions," he said. "And because of the metabolic disruption, future fertility or cyclicity is likely to be impacted."What can farms do to protect their herds?Although there are many unknowns about the transmission of the disease, Bickett-Weddle says dairy farmers can take some proactive measures. One involves limiting animal movement."Of course, you should isolate cows displaying symptoms from the herd. But we recommend delaying or stopping incoming or returning animals from herds that have unknown or suspected health status," she said. "If they're introduced, separate or quarantine them for a minimum of 21 days. While they're being held, be sure to monitor them for symptoms. And be sure to keep records of all cattle movement."Because it is unknown whether the disease is transmitted to cows or between animals through saliva, leaked milk, manure or urine, use of livestock trucks and trailers should be limited to your own cattle, or cleaned and disinfected when used to hail cattle from other operations with unknown health status."Protect your dairy operation by delaying or stopping non-essential visitors. Contact with cattle should be limited to essential visitors who should follow the farm's biosecurity plan, including milk testers and hoof trimmers," she said. "As for milk haulers, don't go into animal housing areas or where milk is fed to calves.""We don't have conclusive answers yet and we're erring on the side of caution. We have to do this to break the transmission cycle," Bickett-Weddle added.Wisconsin has no plans to curb herd movement at this timeDuring a media Zoom Wednesday morning hosted by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, State Veterinarian Darlene Konkle confirmed that Wisconsin officials have no plans at this time to implement changes concerning the movement of animals.Nebraska, one of five states where Avian Influenza has been detected in dairy herds, announced that the Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) has established an Importation Order prohibiting all breeding female dairy cattle from entering the state without a permit issued by NDA due to the recent outbreak. The Order will remain in place through April 30, 2024."We've been watching what other states have been doing and we feel that Wisconsin has robust traceability requirements in place including certificates of veterinary inspection for cattle coming in," Konkle said, stressing that sick animals should not be moving. "It's an evolving situation and there's definitely a potential that our import requirements could change. But we don't have any changes planned at this time."Konkle also stressed to the public that despite HPAI being detected in cattle, the food supply remains safe."Pasteurization of milk and cooking meat both kill HPAI," she said.

According to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, this is the fourth time the virus was detected in a commercial facility and the first detection in the county. This comes a week after the virus was detected in a herd in Michigan that recently received cows from Texas.Officials say the facility is under quarantine, and the birds will be depopulated to prevent a spread to other flocks."As the weather remains cool and wild birds continue their migration, conditions are ideal for the virus to thrive and spread. While these conditions persist, the need to take preventative measures will be high," Dr. Nora Wineland, state Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland, said in a statement. "Keeping HPAI out of Michigan's domestic animals remains a team effort, and it must be a top priority for all." The virus was first detected in 2022. Health officials say HPAI is spread from flock to flock, such as wild birds.MDARD provided the following tips for protecting domestic birds:Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed.Wash your hands before and after handling birds, as well as when moving between different coops.Disinfect boots and other gear when moving between coops.Do not share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms.Clean and disinfect equipment and other supplies between.

But while bird flu has infected many of the worldâs nations, new research confirms that Australia has remained virus free. As an unprecedented outbreak of bird flu continues to spread across the world, leaving millions of dead animals in its wake, one region has remarkably remained virus free. Oceania has so far managed to avoid the arrival of the strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) that is currently devasting global bird populations. Australia, New Zealand and other Pacific nations have recorded no cases over the past couple of years, most likely due to their location away from major landmasses and migratory routes. However, with HPAI infecting Antarctica for the first time this year there are renewed concerns that bird flu may rear its head in the Pacific and pose a risk to the threatened birds that live there, like the fairy tern. The monitoring of migratory birds arriving in Australia has shown that up to 2023 the virus has been kept out. Dr Alex Bond, the Principal Curator and Curator in Charge of Birds at the Natural History Museum, was one of the co-authors of this research. âMigratory birds are one vector for diseases spreading into new areas, but species migrating into Australia donât seem to be carrying bird flu,â says Alex. âThe migratory shearwaters we looked at mix with other species in the north Pacific, but donât appear to have contracted the virus.â âItâs not entirely certain why this is, but it might be because shearwaters spend a lot of time out at sea where theyâre less densely packed, making it harder for the virus to spread between them.â The study was published in the journal Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses. With the H5N1 virus having arrived in Antarctica, there are fears it could spread rapidly in the continent's penguin colonies. Â©Â vladsilver /Shutterstock. The bird flu outbreak so far The origins of the current bird flu outbreak lie in 1996, when a type of influenza A known as H5N1 emerged in southeast Asia. Even though this isnât the only form of the virus that can cause HPAI, its ability to spread between birds and mammals means it has attracted a great deal of attention. Like all influenza viruses, it has an extraordinary ability to adapt. The virus regularly mutates and can spread these changes between individual viruses when they infect a cell at the same time. This means that while this H5N1 strain was first detected in geese, it contains other genes that appear to have come from viruses infecting ducks and other birds. Though H5N1 viruses have been causing sporadic outbreaks since being discovered 20 years ago, a new variant, known as 2.3.4.4b, has killed an unprecedented number of wild birds and poultry around the world. But it is not just this high bird mortality rate that is of concern. Though itâs not believed the virus is currently spreading directly between mammals, thousands of seals and sea lions have died during the outbreak after being exposed to infected seabirds and their droppings. This jump to mammals has raised many alarm bells, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. While ducks and their relatives used to be the main carriers of bird flu, the spread of the virus to south Atlantic and sub-Antarctic islands suggests that seabirds may also be helping the virus to travel. Â In February 2024, HPAI was recorded on the Antarctic mainland for the first time, raising fears for the continentâs vast penguin population. As the birds live together in dense colonies it is feared that the virus could spread rapidly between them if some birds get infected. The research team took samples from a variety of birds, including the short-tailed shearwater. Â© ivandonÂ /Shutterstock. Will bird flu spread to Australia? In contrast to the rest of the world, Oceania has remained largely bird flu free despite the occasional outbreak in poultry. The regionâs geographical isolation, and the fact that many Oceanian ducks donât migrate to other continents is thought to have limited the spread of bird flu. However, this could change. Migratory seabirds travelling between continents have now been implicated in spreading the current strain of the virus, meaning that the region may no longer be cut off from bird flu in the same way as before. To confirm this, the researchers took blood, saliva and cloacal samples from almost 1100 migratory seabirds and waders arriving in Australia between October and December 2023. They sampled a variety of different sites, including breeding grounds on Lord Howe Island and Phillip Island. Incredibly, none of the birds showed any signs of HPAI and no samples contained H5N1. The team suggest that as the route of these seabirds passes through areas where other H5N1 variants are more prominent, this might offer some protection to the current strain. While this suggests that Oceania is safe from bird flu for now, the detection of the virus in Antarctica may change things. A number of sea bird species, such as albatrosses, are known to travel vast distances throughout the southern oceans and between the sub-Antarctic islands and Oceania. A recent update from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health warned that this was a plausible scenario, calling for greater monitoring of the birdsâ movement and health to prevent it becoming reality. 54 Oceans Disease Endangered species Birds Museum research Read more Read the paper in fullÂ published in Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses.

After human case from infected cow in Texas, over 500 penguins found dead in Antarctica The human patient had a mutation, PB2 E627K, which is linked to the virus adapting to mammalian hostsPhoto for representation: iStock Nandita BanerjiPublished on: 05 Apr 2024, 7:31 amCopiedThe recent confirmation of a second human case of H5N1 avian influenza in the United States has reignited anxieties about a potential bird flu pandemic. This follows months of widespread outbreaks in wild birds and poultry flocks, causing significant economic damage and raising concerns about the virus's potential to jump species. On April 1, 2024, a case of a Texas dairy worker contracting H5N1 after exposure to infected cows was reported, raising questions about the virus’s potential for human-to-human transmission. A dozen cow herds in six states and three cats in Texas have also died due to infection.The White House, on April 3, 2024, said it is closely tracking and monitoring the situation. The US reported its first-ever human case of H5N1 bird flu in 2022. Read more: First cases of avian flu found in Antarctic regionMeanwhile, the virus may be fast spreading in Antarctic Peninsula region. An expedition of scientists from Federation University, Australia found the carcasses of 532 Adélie penguins on a small part of an island, and suspect the casualties may be much higher, going into several thousands. Although the researchers believe this was caused by high-pathogenicity avian influenza, virus presence has not been confirmed and additional testing will be conducted in the coming months to determine the cause of death.The human patient had a mutation, PB2 E627K, which is linked to the virus adapting to mammalian hosts, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The development is concerning, as bird flu viruses typically don’t infect humans. However, rare cases of human infection have occurred with some of these viruses, according to CDC. However, the mutation has been detected earlier.“Overall, the genetic analysis of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses in Texas supports CDC’s conclusion that the human health risk currently remains low,” CDC said in a statement.Read more: We should only worry about bird flu making us sick when we see human-to-human transmissionHowever, some experts have raised concerns regarding the virulence and mortality of the virus, warning about a bird flu pandemic. According to United Kingdom based news website Daily Mail, experts have warned that a bird flu pandemic could be “100 times worse than COVID” and kill up to half of those infected.“'I think this is a virus that has the greatest pandemic threat [that is] playing out in plain sight and is globally present,” Dr Suresh Kuchipudi, a bird flu researcher in Pittsburgh, was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail report. The report also mentioned that the infection has been observed in various mammals such as cows, cats, and humans, which raises concerns about the virus potentially mutating to become more easily transmissible, the report added. However, other experts have also pointed out it was too early to panic because there were still too many unknowns about recent cases to warrant sounding an alarm, it added.The virus has long been on the radar of experts as a pandemic risk. Read more: French bird flu vaccine for ducks may be launched soonA recent study, published in journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, indicated that the avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 entered a significant panzootic phase between 2020 and 2023, akin to a pandemic within the animal kingdom.Researchers analysed data on infected mammals from 59 scientific articles spanning two distinct periods: 2020–2023 and 2003–2019. The study highlights the potential risks posed to human health by mammalian adaptation of the virus, noting a lack of comprehensive information on the current panzootic event (2020–2023).In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) and influenza experts worldwide had expressed concerns over the spread of the avian flu virus. The global health agency predicted that, even in the best-case scenarios, the pandemic could lead to 2 to 7 million deaths and tens of millions needing medical care.According to a 2007 research paper published in International Journal of Health Sciences, “The first ominous sign that avian influenza viruses (H5N1) could directly infect humans from avian species on a large scale occurred in 1997 in Hong Kong, resulting in 18 documented cases and six fatalities.” Read more: Learning from COVID-19: Here’s what is needed to prepare for the next global health emergencyIndia reported its first and only case of human avian influenza A(H5N1) in Haryana on July 21, 2021.The current strain causing worry, H5N1, has been circulating aggressively in birds across the globe since late 2021. Wild birds are natural carriers of this virus, and their migratory patterns contribute to its rapid spread. This has resulted in a significant increase in confirmed bird flu cases compared to past years. Since January 1, 2022, the US Department Of Agriculture has reported close to 9,500 cases in wild birds.WorldAvian Flubird fluH5N1 virusAvian flu outbreakAvian influenzabird flu h5n1H5N1Show CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

A Cal-Maine Foods facility in Parmer County, Texas, has temporarily ceased operations after highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected on the premises, the company said Tuesday. After some of its chickens tested positive for the virus, Cal-Maine, the nation’s largest egg producer, depopulated approximately 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets, or approximately 3.6% of the Company’s total flock as of March 2. Cal-Maine is working to increase production at other locations to minimize disruption to its customers. "This is absolutely devastating news for Cal-Maine and the entire Panhandle region which has already suffered so much already," Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a statement. “Given this latest development, all producers must practice heightened biosecurity measures. The rapid spread of this virus means we must act quickly." The detection at Cal-Maine comes as a peculiar strain of avian influenza starts to affect herds of dairy cows in Texas, Kansas, Michigan and other parts of the country. There is no risk of the virus being harmful to the country’s milk supply, federal officials said. However, a person tested positive for bird flu after presumed contact with infected cattle in Texas, health officials confirmed Monday. “The current risk to the public remains minimal,” Miller said. "It is important for us as an industry to maintain a high level of vigilance. State and national agencies will continue to provide updated guidance as developments warrant.” This is not the first time Cal-Maine has paused production due to bird flu. During the third quarter ending March 2, the company reported an outbreak within its facilities in Kansas, resulting in the depopulation of 1.5 million laying hens and 240,000 pullets. “Like other producers, we have navigated significant challenges related to [avian influenza], and we remain diligent in our efforts to mitigate any future risks,” Sherman Miller, president and CEO of Cal-Maine, said in a statement. The risk of the virus spreading to humans through contaminated eggs is low. YOY sales decline but egg demand boosts earnings On Tuesday, Cal-Maine reported net sales of $703 million during the third quarter, down 30% from the previous year, citing a “significant decrease” in egg prices. A year ago, prices were historically high for eggs due to problems related to avian influenza. Once again, seasonal and market forces are driving prices higher as bird flu continues to affect commercial operations. Net income for the latest quarter was $146.7 million compared to a record $323.2 million last year. As profits leveled out, Cal-Maine’s sales volumes increased 3% from last year’s corresponding quarter. At the end of the quarter, Cal-Maine closed its acquisition of a former Tyson Foods facility in Dexter, Missouri. The company plans to repurpose the acquired assets for eggs and egg production. “We remain focused on identifying other acquisition opportunities that complement our operating model and further extend our market reach,” Miller said. purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Meat, Dairy, Operations Agriculture Dive news delivered to your inbox Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Email: Select user consent: By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

This marks the second confirmed U.S. case. The first case was reported in Colorado in 2022. The most recent case is the first linked to cattle exposure. What You Need To Know The Texas Department of State Health Services on Monday reported the first human case of bird flu in Texas According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this marks the second human case in the U.S. and the first linked to exposure to infected cattle. The first case was reported in Colorado in 2022 The risk of infection among people remains low, DSHS said This flu typically infects wild birds but can spread to domesticated birds and other animals DSHS said the person who contracted bird flu was in direct contact with presumably infected cattle. The patientâs only symptom is eye inflammation. The person was tested for flu by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week, and confirmatory testing was conducted this past weekend. The patient is being treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir. DSHS said risk to the public remains low. The Texas Department of State Health Services has confirmed a human case of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in Texas. The case does not change the risk for the public, which remains low. For more information, visit https:/.co/Qme5ad8CUw. pic.twitter.com/lXQWwrc4H0 â Texas DSHS (@TexasDSHS) April 1, 2024 The Texas Animal Health Commission in March announced the first cases of bird flu in cattle in the Texas Panhandle. The cattle infections, DSHS said, do not present a concern for commercial milk production. Dairies are required to destroy or divert milk from infected cows. This flu typically infects wild birds but can spread to domesticated birds and other animals. It occasionally infects people. Person-to-person transmission is rare, DHSH said. Still, people who work in the cattle industry are urged to monitor for flu-like symptoms and get tested.

The patient is only the second person known to have contracted this strain of bird flu in the U.S. and the first anywhere infected through mammals, The Associated Press said.Who said what"Initial testing has not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans," the CDC, FDA and USDA said jointly. "This indicates that the current risk to the public remains low."The commentaryThe Texas patient exhibited only eye inflammation, but the case "has alarmed disease trackers monitoring for the worst-case scenario: human-to-human transmission," The Washington Post said. Bird flu has been spreading through wild animals and, since March 25, dairy herds in Texas, Kansas, Michigan and New Mexico, so the jump to humans "really wasn't a question of if but when," UTHealth Houston's Dr. Luis Ostrosky said to the Houston Chronicle.

(ABC News)abc.net.auews/high-number-of-queensland-flu-cases-sparks-concern/103655358Link copiedShareShare articleIn short: Authorities are worried about a possible spike in flu hospitalisations this year.Only one in three Queenslanders received a flu vaccination last year.What's next? Free flu vaccinations can be booked at GPs and pharmacies.Eleven people have died from influenza in Queensland and more than 7,000 cases have been recorded so far this year, with health authorities voicing concern about the number of hospitalisations this flu season.Since the start of 2024, more than 700 people have been hospitalised due to serious illness from influenza.There are currently 83 people in hospital, according to the most recent Queensland Health data, published on March 25.Acting Chief Health Officer Catherine McDougall said the number of hospitalisations for this time of year was concerning."This year alone, we have seen hundreds of people already hospitalised with influenza, with people aged 65 and over most affected," Dr McDougall said."These hospitalisations are concerning given we are still a few months off from the peak flu season."We hope to see more Queenslanders get vaccinated this year against the flu — particularly pregnant people, children aged between six months and five years, and those aged 65 and over."Authorities are worried flu hospitalisations could spike later this year. (ABC News: Chris Gillette)'Vaccine fatigue'Flu season typically runs from May to October, with most cases recorded in August.Queensland Health figures show there had been 7,190 lab confirmed cases of influenza in the year to March 25 — more than double the five-year average.The state has recorded more than 18,500 COVID-19 cases so far this year, although total case numbers for both viruses are believed to be much higher.Last year, Queensland recorded more than 74,000 flu cases and 144 deaths were reported.Premier Steven Miles said the state government would again be rolling out free flu vaccines for anyone aged six months and older."Our free flu vaccination program is an easy way to get yourself covered ahead of winter without the barrier of cost, and has helped almost one million people get protected so far," he said.Free vaccines can be booked at GPs and pharmacies.The $40 million program continues the free vaccines, which have been on offer since 2022.Shannon Fentiman said the flu has already claimed 11 lives in Queensland this year. (ABC News: Chris Gillette)But Mr Miles said influenza vaccine uptake dropped significantly last year compared to 2022, with only one in three Queenslanders vaccinated."Many people have vaccine fatigue after the pandemic, which means we are recording significant drops in vaccinations against things like the flu," Mr Miles said."While it might seem like the common cold, influenza can be deadly, which is why it's so important to get a flu shot every single year."Queensland Health said flu vaccination uptake was particularly low last year among children aged five and under.Health Minister Shannon Fentiman said getting a flu shot would help ease pressure on the health system."We know nearly all people presenting to hospital with the flu last year had not been vaccinated, which puts significant pressure on our emergency departments," she said."Making it free ahead of the peak flu season keeps people safe and ensures our health system is available for Queenslanders who need it most."Posted Mon 1 Apr 2024 at 8:21pmMonday 1 Apr 2024 at 8:21pmMon 1 Apr 2024 at 8:21pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

News Lubbock experts respond to bird flu found in chickens at West Texas plant by: Julianna Washburn Posted: Apr 3, 2024 / 07:44 PM CDT Updated: Apr 3, 2024 / 07:44 PM CDT by: Julianna Washburn Posted: Apr 3, 2024 / 07:44 PM CDT Updated: Apr 3, 2024 / 07:44 PM CDT SHARE LUBBOCK, Texas — The largest fresh egg producer in the U.S., Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., temporarily shut down their Parmer County facility on Tuesday after getting a positive avian influenza test back. This forced the company to depopulate, or put down, 1.6 million laying hens and 337,000 pullets. In total, the depopulation took away 3.6% of the company’s flock. However, it’s not just birds that are getting sick according to Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller. The halt in production in Farwell comes just days after a Texas man got the virus and a month after herds of West Texas cows have come down with it, too. “We had a mysterious disease going through our dairy herds up there,” Miller said. “It was a total mystery.” Lubbock Habitat for Humanity finishes build at Texas State Capitol Miller said they noticed a problem when milk production suddenly started to go down. Eventually, they figured out it was bird flu that was making the cows sick. Experts aren’t sure yet how the cows or the person contracted the bird flu. “We have a lot of unanswered questions. We don’t know if it’s transferred from cow to cow or cow to human,” Miller said. The week’s supply – which was millions – of eggs lost at the Farewell facility, is hard on the producers in the Panhandle who just braved the devastating wildfires that ravaged the area last month. However, Miller said consumers shouldn’t be too concerned about that loss affecting prices at the grocery store. “It’s less than 4% of their overall production. So, it’s not enough to make a blip on the radar for having a crisis of shortage of eggs or chickens. We’ll be fine,” Miller said. Nevertheless, cows getting avian influenza is uncharted territory according to Assistant Professor of General Veterinary Practice at Texas Tech School of Veterinary Medicine, Clinton Roof. “We’re seeing cows that are normally producing between 75 and 100 pounds of milk suddenly dropping 40% or more in their daily production,” Roof said. If this sickness continues to run through cows, Roof said it could be devastating for dairy producers and potentially raise prices at grocery stores. TABC investigating Lubbock bars in connection to deadly motorcycle crash in March “These producers aren’t going to be able to carry forward and unfortunately may end up having to go bankrupt or their business will go under,” Roof said. Miller, on the contrary, believes dairy producers and grocery stores will ultimately be okay since cows typically recover from avian influenza within a week. However, both experts are still searching for answers to how to prevent further spreading. “We’re trying to create new responses, new treatments and new support for these animals,” Roof said. Miller told EverythingLubbock.com that there are no eggs or milk in the food system with bird flu, but he said it’s never a bad idea to be cautious and cook eggs fully before eating them or avoid raw milk while they’re still trying to find answers.
