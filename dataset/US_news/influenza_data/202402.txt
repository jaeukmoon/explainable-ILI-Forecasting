For the first time in months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday a slight dip in how many people are getting the flu or being hospitalized from it, although experts warn that the virus isn't done yet. The latest numbers are from the first week in January, and may simply reflect that schools were closed and that people tend to be less likely to see their doctor over the holidays."A lot of times after a one- or two-week decrease around the holidays, we see a pickup in activity again," said Alicia Budd, head of the CDC's domestic influenza surveillance team. That occurred during the 2019-2020 season, when the flu dropped around the same time, but then spiked two more times, in February and March.CDC"It is too early to know whether activity has peaked for the season," Budd said.As of Friday, the CDC estimates that the flu has sickened 14 million people so far, with 150,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 9,400 deaths. There were at least 13 pediatric deaths from the flu reported last week. Based on prior CDC reports, the number of children who have died so far this season is likely an undercount. While the elderly are most likely to be hospitalized with the flu, Dr. Dhaval Desai, director of Hospital Medicine at Emory Saint Joseph’s Hospital in Atlanta, said he’s seeing severe cases among all ages."It's not always necessarily the geriatric, older patients,” he said. “I’ve had quite a few younger patients in their 20s to 40s admitted with flu.” Dehydration, wheezing, severe head and muscle aches and "high fevers that are staying high, above 104," are the main symptoms driving people to the hospital, Desai said.Shortness of breath sent Quenten Thomas of Maryville, Tennessee, to the hospital last week. The normally energetic, outgoing 27-year-old was unable to get enough air into his lungs. "It hurt when he coughed," his father, Robert Thomas, said. "He was having trouble catching his breath.” Quenten Thomas of Marysville, Tenn.Courtesy Kensie ThomasQuenten Thomas, a father of three young children, had to be put on a ventilator but his condition deteriorated quickly. He died from flu complications Jan. 6. He had not received the flu shot this year. "I'm still in shock," Robert Thomas said, urging people to take the flu more seriously. "I know I will for the rest of my life."Flu symptoms and warning signs"The biggest thing we're seeing right now is fevers," said Dr. Rachael Lee, an associate professor in the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, "as well as fatigue and significant body aches."Some have reported unusually severe symptoms, even if they've been vaccinated. Desai said he caught the flu in early November, a full month after his flu shot.He had a high fever, sweats, cough, sore throat and crushing fatigue. He became so dehydrated that he ended up in the emergency room. Those intense symptoms are hallmarks of how the flu can cause widespread inflammation in the body, putting the “whole body in a stress state,” Desai said. Fevers of at least 103 degrees that carry on for several days, as well as signs of severe dehydration, also require medical attention, doctors said."If you're having difficulty breathing, that would be an indication to seek emergency care," said Dr. Andi Shane, head of pediatric infectious diseases at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. A sign of dangerous dehydration is feeling "dizzy when you stand up and so weak that you can't walk from one side of the room to the other," Desai said. People may also develop an intense headache.Is it too late to get the flu shot?Anyone ages 6 months and older can still get vaccinated. While it typically takes two weeks after vaccination to build strong immunity, the flu season can last until spring. "Even if we have peaked, we still have half the season to go," CDC's Budd said. The shot, she said, seems to be a good match to the circulating flu strains. On Thursday, researchers in Canada reported that the shot is 61% effective in protecting against the predominant strain: H1N1. Among children ages 9 and younger, effectiveness rose to 74%. Unfortunately, the number of people getting vaccinated this year is down, including pregnant women who are highly vulnerable to serious illness and children, based on early data. An estimated 10 million fewer people — including children and adults — got their flu shots so far compared to the same time last year, according to the CDC. "There is some degree of vaccination fatigue in the community," Desai said.The majority of his patients hospitalized with flu this season, he said, have not had the flu shot. While the vaccine does not necessarily prevent a person from getting infected with the flu, experts maintain that it can reduce the severity and length of the illness. "The flu vaccine is not a particularly good vaccine at preventing flu," said Dr. Bruce Farber, chief of public health and epidemiology at Northwell Health in New York. "But it's a very good vaccine for preventing people from winding up in a hospital or being ill or dying of flu."While the flu has been spreading rapidly over the last few weeks, Shane said, the new numbers are generally in line with previous, typical flu seasons.“I think that we are returning to the pre-pandemic flu season,” she said. “If we look and compare what happened last season compared with this season, we do seem to be trending towards our more normal seasonality.”CORRECTION: (Jan. 18, 5:25 p.m. ET) A previous version of this article misspelled the Thomases’ hometown.

Gabrielle Weaver) VIEW ORIGINAL ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. –Defense public health experts are sounding the alarm and urging the general population to prevent a double threat of both COVID and flu infections. “As the chilly temperatures drive more people indoors, the sharing of close quarters and air space provides an ideal environment for spreading germs,” said Steven Starbuck, who serves on the COVID-19 task force at the Defense Centers for Public Health–Aberdeen. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that influenza (flu) was associated with 9 million illnesses, 4 million medical visits, 10,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths during the 2021–2022 flu season. Similarly, over the period of 2020–2023, COVID-19 has resulted in more than 6 million hospitalizations and more than one million deaths in the United States. Additionally, some people, such as adults 65 years and older, young children, and people with certain health conditions, are at higher risk of serious complications. The CDC reports that flu and COVID-19 are contagious respiratory illnesses that are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first identified in 2019. Flu is caused by infection with a flu virus (influenza viruses). The CDC also notes that both COVID-19 and flu can have varying degrees of symptoms, ranging from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe symptoms. Common symptoms that COVID-19 and flu share include: Fever or feeling feverish/having chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue (tiredness) Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle pain or body aches Headache Vomiting Diarrhea (more frequent in children with flu, but can occur in any age with COVID-19) Change in or loss of taste or smell, although this is more frequent with COVID-19.

Karina Lopezmata) VIEW ORIGINAL Although the viruses have different origins, public health officials say you can prevent both infections through similar tactics. “Fortunately, the same methods we use to prevent the flu are just as effective to prevent COVID,” said Dr. Steven Cersovsky—a board certified physician who also serves as the Deputy Director of the Defense Centers for Public Health–Aberdeen. ”These measures include washing your hands frequently, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, and staying home or wearing a mask around others if you feel sick. While all of these measures can slow down rates of infection, Defense public health officials say that the best way to prevent both the flu and COVID is to get the appropriate vaccines each year. “Taking the vaccines protects our workforce, our communities, and our nation,’” said Cersovsky. For most people who need only one dose for the season, the CDC recommends getting vaccinated in September or October. While most experts agree that it is ideal to get vaccinated by the end of October, it’s important to know that vaccination, even into the new year, can still provide protection during the peak of flu season. Kevin Delaney, chief of public health communications for DCPH-A, said that although flu and COVID-19 vaccinations have helped to slow the spread of infections, it is important to not become too relaxed. “We will have to remain vigilant in the fight against contagious diseases,” said Delaney. “We must continue to take the necessary steps to protect our forces, our families and ourselves.” For more information on preventing COVID-19, visit: About COVID-19 | CDC For more information on preventing the flu visit: Influenza (Flu) | CDC The Defense Health Agency supports our Nation by improving health and building readiness—making extraordinary experiences ordinary and exceptional outcomes routine.

Health problems & ageing Influenza (flu) and HIV Primary tabs View(active tab) Preview Roger Pebody January 2024 Estimated reading time 8 minutes Mareike Günsche | www.aspect-us.com Key points People living with HIV are recommended to have the flu vaccine every year. Flu is very contagious and spreads in the same way as colds. You can get flu at any time of the year, but it is more common in winter. Influenza, usually known as the flu, is a very common viral illness that affects the respiratory tract. The flu is different to the common cold. Colds and flu share some of the same symptoms but flu symptoms tend to be more severe and last longer. You can get flu at any time of the year, but it is more common during the winter season. Because of this, it is sometimes referred to as seasonal flu. In the UK, a flu vaccination programme is provided by the NHS each year that runs during the autumn (see below for more information). People living with HIV are urged to have their flu vaccine each year. You may be offered a flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time. Jump to Key points How is flu spread? What are the symptoms of flu? Treating flu Preventing flu The flu vaccine How is flu spread? Flu is very contagious and spreads from one person to another in tiny droplets when someone with flu coughs or sneezes – the same way colds and COVID-19 are spread. The virus sits in the air before falling down to surfaces where it can live for up to 24 hours. People can be infected by breathing in the droplets directly from the air or by touching objects that have the virus on them, such as phones, keyboards and door handles. The incubation period for flu (the time between catching an infection and symptoms appearing) is normally around one to three days. People are usually most infectious from the day they develop symptoms and for a further three to seven days, and are not considered infectious anymore once their symptoms have disappeared. People with weakened immune systems and children may stay infectious for longer. What are the symptoms of flu? Flu symptoms tend to develop quite suddenly and are often at their worst two or three days after infection. They usually start to improve after about a week but it may take longer to feel completely better. Flu symptoms can include: fever or high temperature (over 38°C or 100.4°F) headache tiredness and weakness chills a runny or blocked nose sneezing sore throat a dry, chesty cough aching muscles and limb or joint pain difficulty sleeping loss of appetite diarrhoea and abdominal pain nausea and vomiting. You should contact your GP if you develop chest pain, difficulty breathing, or start coughing up blood; if your condition is still getting worse after seven days; or if a child under 12 months shows symptoms of flu. The latest news and research on health problems & ageing Flu can, in some cases, lead to complications and more serious illness (such as bronchitis or pneumonia) and can make some long-term health conditions worse. People at higher risk of this should consider contacting their GP if they have flu symptoms. These are: pregnant women people aged 65 and over people with long-term medical conditions - including HIV - as well as respiratory diseases like asthma or tuberculosis (TB), diabetes, kidney disease, lung disease, heart disease or a neurological disease people with a weakened immune system, such as people with a low CD4 cell count or those having chemotherapy. Treating flu Generally, you should stay at home, rest, drink plenty of fluids, keep warm, and use over-the-counter painkillers (such as paracetamol or ibuprofen) to relieve symptoms. Glossary vaccine A substance that contains antigenic components from an infectious organism. By stimulating an immune response (but not disease), it protects against subsequent infection by that organism, or may direct an immune response against an established infection or cancer. symptom Any perceptible, subjective change in the body or its functions that signals the presence of a disease or condition, as reported by the patient. effectiveness How well something works (in real life conditions). See also 'efficacy'. CD4 cell count A test that measures the number of CD4 cells in the blood, thus reflecting the state of the immune system. The CD4 cell count of a person who does not have HIV can be anything between 500 and 1500. When the CD4 count of an adult falls below 200, there is a high risk of opportunistic infections and serious illnesses. antiviral A drug that acts against a virus or viruses. If you are in the higher risk groups, your GP may suggest that you take one of the antiviral medications that are used to treat flu – oseltamavir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza). The drugs must be taken at or near the start of the illness to be effective. They are not a cure, but can relieve symptoms and shorten the length of time you are ill. Not all doctors agree that antivirals should be prescribed as research has suggested that they may not be effective at reducing the risk of complications of flu and they may cause side-effects. However, evidence shows that people who are seriously unwell, or who are at risk of becoming seriously unwell, should be prescribed these drugs. If you take antiviral drugs but your condition does not improve, contact your GP. As flu is viral, not bacterial, antibiotics will not work. However, if you develop a complication of flu, such as a bacterial chest infection, they may be prescribed. Preventing flu Good hygiene is the most effective way of stopping the transmission of viruses such as flu viruses. Washing your hands regularly with soap and water and cleaning surfaces regularly will help prevent infection. For people with flu, sneezing and coughing into a tissue, throwing the tissue away and then washing your hands, will also help prevent onward transmission. Flu can be prevented (as well as treated) with the antiviral medicines oseltamavir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). In some situations, people living with HIV may be prescribed these as a preventive measure. Having a low CD4 cell count can increase the risk of complications of flu (and having a condition such as asthma or TB as well can increase the risk further). If you do have a low CD4 count or an AIDS-defining illness, it would be a good idea to check with your HIV clinic whether you could be taking any other action to reduce your risk of getting flu. However, the most useful action you can take is to have an annual flu vaccination. The flu vaccine Vaccines against flu viruses are available. Because there are different types of flu viruses, and different strains within those types, with strains changing and new strains emerging over time, the make-up of the vaccine is reviewed each year to include the most prevalent strains. It is recommended that people in higher risk groups, including people living with HIV of all ages, have the vaccination every year. Household members and other close contacts of people who are immunocompromised (have a weakened immune system) should also have the flu vaccine. People living with HIV who have a CD4 count below 200 would be considered to be immunocompromised. The vaccine is also available for people aged 65 and over, pregnant women, people with other long-term health conditions, health workers, carers, and children aged 2-16 years. In the UK, vaccination is free of charge for people in these groups. "Good hygiene is the most effective way of stopping the transmission of viruses such as flu viruses." The vaccine only provides protection for about a year, so it is important you are revaccinated each year.The best time to have the vaccine is in the autumn, between September and early November. The vaccine is available at GP surgeries. You will need to be registered with a GP and to have told them of your HIV status to be eligible. If you have a low CD4 cell count, anyone you live with may also be eligible for free vaccination. Ask your GP about this. You can also talk to your GP about having vaccinations against COVID-19 and pneumococcal disease. The seasonal flu vaccine that most adults take doesn’t have ‘live’ virus in it, so it is safe for use by people living with HIV. The vaccine is effective for people living with HIV, although there is some evidence that people with low CD4 counts are less likely to be protected by it (however, it may reduce the risk of complications). Pregnant women living with HIV can have the flu vaccine. Your GP should take into account other drugs you are taking that may interact with the flu vaccine. The HIV Pharmacy Association (HIVPA) advises that there are no interactions between the flu vaccine and antiretrovirals (anti-HIV drugs). Therefore, it is safe to take antiretrovirals with the flu vaccine and the vaccine is recommended for people living with HIV. There is more information on flu vaccination on the NHS website.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services confirmed the death of a Big Horn County resident under the age of 18 years due to influenza. DPHHS confirms that this is the 11th influenza-related death in Montana, as of Jan. 5, 2024, and the first pediatric death of the 2023-2024 influenza season. In Montana, the last flu-related pediatric death occurred during the 2022-2023 influenza season when one person under the age of 18 died. Montana is currently experiencing widespread influenza activity with cases and outbreaks reported in 49 of the 56 counties. Montana reported 5,759 confirmed cases of influenza and 304 influenza-related hospitalizations between Oct. 1, 2023, and December 30, 2023. Current data for influenza can be found on the new Montana Influenza Dashboard available here. COVID-19 is also circulating widely in the state. Between Oct. 1, 2023, and Dec. 30, 2023, 9,094 COVID-19 cases have been reported, including 530 hospitalizations and 55 deaths. Montanans of all age groups have been getting ill due to COVID-19; however, individuals over the age of 60 years have higher rates of hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. The number of people ill due to respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus continues to increase across the state. DPHHS has launched an online dashboard with current data for each condition. Vaccination remains the best form of protection against serious outcomes of these diseases, such as hospitalization or death due to infection. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems and other chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease) are at greatest risk for hospitalization and death due to infection, but healthy children and adults can still experience severe disease. Vaccines are available for COVID-19, influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, and RSV. To find vaccine locations, visit vaccines.gov, or contact your local health department or health care provider. Updated COVID-19 vaccines are available for Montanans ages six months and older. Several flu vaccines are available for Montanans ages 6 months and older. One dose offers protection for the full season (October – June). Pneumococcal vaccines help protect against a deadly form of bacterial pneumonia, which is the most serious form of pneumococcal disease. Older persons and those with chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, existing lung disease) are at higher risk for contracting this disease and experiencing serious health outcomes. Adults 60 years and older are eligible to receive RSV vaccines after discussion with their health care provider. Infants and young children under 24 months old may be eligible to receive a monoclonal antibody product that offers protection from severe RSV infection. Montanans are encouraged to consult with a health care provider to determine their recommended vaccine options heading into this respiratory season. In addition to vaccination, Montanans can take everyday precautions to help stop the spread of respiratory illness. Those precautions include: Stay home if you are experiencing symptoms of a respiratory illness. If you have a fever, stay home for at least 24 hours until after the fever is gone without the use of fever reducing medication, unless you need to seek medical care. Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in it. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Cover your mouth with your inner elbow or a disposable tissue anytime you cough or sneeze. Avoid contact with people experiencing symptoms of a respiratory illness. Symptoms of COVID-19, flu, RSV, and other respiratory illnesses are similar and may include a fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, headache, body aches, and low energy. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, consult with your medical provider. Your provider may recommend that you get tested to confirm a diagnosis. Antiviral medications are available for certain individuals with influenza or COVID-19 infections. Anyone experiencing symptoms such as trouble breathing, shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new onset of confusion or disorientation, inability to stay awake, or other severe or concerning symptoms should seek immediate medical evaluation.

Creative CommonsExpandJanuary 8, 2024UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Seasonal virus activity has increased since the holiday season, with influenza-like activity high in two-thirds of the country, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Students may be at risk for respiratory illnesses because of exposure through common living spaces, classrooms, shared restrooms and social activities. University Health Services (UHS) is encouraging Penn State students and employees to stay current with vaccinations and practice healthy hygiene habits. According to the CDC, low vaccination rates and ongoing increases in national and international respiratory disease activity caused by multiple pathogens, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), could lead to more severe disease and increased strain on health care capacity in the coming weeks. COVID-19 remains the leading cause of respiratory hospitalizations nationally, with flu admissions rising, according to the CDC. “COVID-19 vaccines have been deemed safe by the FDA,” said Rebecca Simcik, UHS medical director. “They meet rigorous testing criteria and effectively prevent serious illness, hospitalization and death. Flu vaccines have an excellent safety profile and continue to be our best defense against serious illness from flu. Staying up to date with COVID-19 and flu vaccines now means less missed time at class, with friends, and attending special events such as THON.” UHS continues to offer annual flu shots and the updated Moderna (Spikevax) COVID-19 vaccine. Students can schedule an appointment at the Student Health Center via myUHS or by calling 814-865-4UHS (4847), option 2. UHS is partnering with Residence Life to offer flu shots in selected commons areas at University Park. “We hope that by bringing flu shots to the residence halls, we can get more students vaccinated to start the semester on a strong note,” said Cecilia Devonshire, UHS infection control nurse manager. “THON is right around the corner, Feb. 16-18, and getting vaccinated in January reduces the chances of catching the flu or getting very sick from flu in time for the event. We also strongly recommend that anyone attending THON receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine. People who are not feeling well in the days leading up to THON should stay home to ensure Four Diamonds kids, their families, and all participants are as protected as possible from exposure to seasonal viruses.” Spring 2024 flu shot clinics at University Park will take place from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the following dates: Tuesday, Jan. 9, at Pollock Commons. Thursday, Jan. 18, at Findlay/Johnston Commons in East Halls. Monday, Jan. 22, at Warnock Commons in North Halls. Friday, Jan. 26, at Waring Commons in West Halls. Tuesday, Jan. 30, at Redifer Commons in South Halls. Students at Penn State Commonwealth Campus locations are encouraged to contact their on-campus health service (if applicable) or local provider to inquire about clinics in their area. Penn State employees and their dependents (age 18 and older) enrolled in the Penn State health insurance plan can receive their flu vaccine at the UHS Pharmacy on campus near the Eisenhower Parking Deck. The pharmacy schedules immunizations Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 7:30-9:30 a.m. and Wednesday from 9-10 a.m. Call the pharmacy to schedule a time at 814-865-4847, option 1.

Seasonal respiratory infection cases at Cook Children’s Medical Center in Fort Worth continue to rise as Influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus spread among children and adults.Between Dec. 24 and Dec. 30, 352 patients admitted at Cook Children’s flagship hospital tested positive for either Influenza A or Influenza B. That’s a 27% positivity rate out of 1,308 tested — a spike from the previous week.During the week of Dec. 17 and Dec. 23, tests for the virus came back 25% positive out of the 1,514 patients who were tested.“Flu is definitely on the rise,” said Dr. Kara Starnes, medical director of Cook Children’s Urgent Care Services. “Entire families are coming in positive since it’s pretty contagious.”Positive cases of RSV continue to come into the pediatric hospital as well, but the virus has steadied compared to the past few months, she said.Between Dec. 24 and Dec. 30, tests for RSV came back 15% positive out of 1,308 patients tested. Back in late October, tests for the virus came back 25% positive.With more sick families, Cook Children’s Medical Center is experiencing an increasing number of people coming into its emergency room, which has resulted in longer wait times.Tarrant County Public Health has listed its flu activity in the region as “widespread,” which is the highest level according to the department’s codes. The widespread level is labeled as “increased influenza-like illness activity and or institutional outbreaks in at least three of the quadrants and recent (within the past 3 week) lab confirmed influenza in the county.”Here’s what families can do to stay healthy as respiratory viruses continue to spread:What to know about the respiratory virusesInfluenza A and Influenza B are the two forms of flu that typically circulate each season and cause mild, cold-like symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sore throat and fever. Both strains are transmitted mainly by respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing from an infected person.Influenza A is usually the most common form of the virus in adults and tends to circulate earlier in the season, but Influenza B is more common and severe among children. Influenza A can spread from animals to humans, but Influenza B only spreads between humans.The flu vaccine typically protects against both strains of influenza. A Tarrant County program, started in 2020, used to provide free flu shots for uninsured residents until it ran out of funding in November.The flu season activity peaks between December and February, but can last as late as May. It is recommended that people receive the vaccine, even if it is later in the season rather than skip it entirely.Flu vaccines are free under most insurance plans. Cash costs vary for uninsured residents. The Fort Worth Report called several local pharmacies for their flu shot costs. Click here for a list of rates.RSV is a respiratory virus with similar symptoms to influenza, according to the CDC. Most children will be infected by the virus by the time they are 2 years old — most recover in a week or two. If untreated, RSV can become bronchiolitis and pneumonia.In July, the FDA approved a new shot to prevent severe respiratory disease caused by RSV in infants and children. The medication, called Beyfortus, also known as nirsevimab-alip, is available to children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.But, the demand for the medication quickly outpaced the supply. Cook Children’s is facing a shortage of the treatment, said Starnes.“Unfortunately, supply is worse now than it was before. There are still doses available for really young babies right after birth, but it’s based on weight and there’s not very many newborn babies that are that low in weight,” she said.What to do if your family tests positive for flu or RSVPeople can prevent the spread of the virus by washing their hands frequently, covering their sneezes and coughs, and staying home when sick.If you or your child only has mild symptoms, it is advised not to go to the emergency department. For mild symptoms, it is recommended to provide frequent nasal suctioning at home and stay hydrated.“I would stress that it’s important to not just go into the emergency department because you want testing for flu, strep, RSV or those types of things,” said Starnes. “Those things are better handled in a primary care office or through telemedicine. Our emergency department is very overwhelmed with volume and so bringing the fewest number of people is really helpful.”If you or your child begins to have severe difficulty breathing, faster breathing than normal, turns blue or has become drowsy, call 911 immediately. Other concerning signs include flared nostrils, wheezing or rattling in their chest, excessive sleepiness, lack of appetite and trouble feeding.At the Fort Worth Report, news decisions are made independently of our board members and financial supporters.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger COVID-19 was the first coronavirus pandemic. The original Sars virus from 2003 and the Mers virus that created a health emergency in South Korea in 2015 were both coronaviruses, but fortunately failed to turn into pandemics in the way that COVID did. Four years on from its appearance, Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID) now seems to be making the transition to an endemic virus: one that circulates in humans all the time, at least somewhere in the world. As is common in respiratory viruses, it also seems to be developing a seasonal preference for the colder, wetter times of the year. But Sars-CoV-2 isn’t alone. There are four other circulating coronaviruses, named OC43, NL63, HKU-1 and 229E. The consensus is that these viruses are also descendants of past pandemics and that Sars-CoV-2 is just the latest member of their club. This theory is based on the model provided by influenza viruses, where the familiar seasonal flus H3N2 and H1N1 are the descendants of the flu pandemics of 1968 and 2009, respectively. Pinning a date on the last coronavirus pandemic But when could these supposed four previous coronavirus pandemics have occurred? The 19th century had three flu pandemics and so did the 20th century. We can read about these in the medical journals and newspapers of the time. However, we cannot do the same for coronavirus pandemics as the very idea of such a thing only reared its head with Sars-CoV-1 in 2003 (which caused severe acute respiratory syndrome or Sars). Surely a past pandemic of COVID-like coronavirus pneumonia would have made the news? Or are we missing something? Scientific interest in this topic has focused on one particular member of the endemic coronavirus quartet: OC43. Genome sequencing tells us it is closely related to bovine coronavirus. OC43 virions taken with a transmission electron microscopic. CDC/Erskine Palmer Indeed, in 2005, the date for its zoonotic transmission – meaning the jump from cattle to humans – was roughly calculated as sometime between 1870 and 1890. The historical veterinary record confirms there was an unexplained disease circulating globally in cattle at that time. Could it have jumped to humans, kicking off an OC43 pandemic? Suspiciously, the pandemic of “Russian influenza” began in 1889 and ran well into 1893. Was that pandemic, always supposed to be influenza, really the last coronavirus pandemic prior to COVID? The idea has caught on, even receiving a mention in the UK COVID public enquiry. Or was it flu after all? Flu virologists are unconvinced. Although the oldest flu genome sequences are those recovered from the frozen bodies of Alaskan victims of the devastating 1918-20 influenza pandemic, there is another way to investigate the ancient history of flu: seroarchaeology. This method takes old blood samples out of the freezer and mixes them with flu viruses. An immunological reaction indicates that the blood sample contains antibodies to the specific types of flu viruses in the experiment. This implies that the person from whom the sample was taken successfully fended off such a flu virus at some time in their lives. Seroarchaeology on archived blood samples shows that well before the H3N2 flu pandemic of 1968, there were elderly people in the population who mysteriously already had antibodies to similar types of flu viruses. And back in 1968, it had already been observed that older people had better survival rates than young ones, contrary to the usual pattern in influenza outbreaks. Those octogenarians of 1968 had all been around in 1889-1893. The combination of that clinical observation and further seroarchaeology pinned down the pandemic of 1889-1893 to an influenza of type H3N8. But if not 1889, then when? The OC43 pandemic theory thus disappeared off the scientific radar. But it left a question: if the 1889-1893 pandemic was influenza H3N8, then when did OC43 make its zoonotic leap from cattle to humans? A study from 2023 examined all the OC43 virus genome information that has accumulated since the original study. The date of the zoonotic transfer from cattle to humans was recalculated, using the latest generation of virus genome analysis software, at 1899-1900. Examination of the total excess deaths per million of population in England and Wales over 1899 and 1900 gave a figure of 1,576 deaths per million, less than the 2,275 deaths per million for the Russian influenza, but only just short of the 1,866 deaths per million for the two worst COVID years of 2020 and 2021. So why was this OC43 pandemic not spotted before? The answer is that the pneumonia epidemic of 1899-1900 had always been dismissed as a late wave of the 1889-1893 influenza. The missing coronavirus pandemic had been hiding in plain sight.

Italy and Spain are on high alert, and face masks are back.https://p.dw.com/p/4b7BASpain has introduced face mask rules as cases of COVID, flu and RSV rise across EuropeImage: Luis Soto/ZUMA/dpa/picture allianceAdvertisementEuropean countries — especially Spain and Italy — are witnessing a surge in the number of people infected with respiratory illnesses. Many local news agencies have reported shortages of hospital beds and overflowing health care facilities. Flu infections across the continent are the biggest concern at the moment. The disease's impact on the health care system is compounded by an increasing number of cases of coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. A potential 'tridemic' in Europe — plus swine flu Other parts of the continent, including Germany and the United Kingdom, have observed a spike in cases of the three diseases — COVID, RSV and flu — in recent weeks. Many countries in Central and Eastern Europe also reported an increase in respiratory illnesses over the final weeks of 2023. "Almost 10,000 deaths from COVID-19 were reported to WHO in December, mostly in Europe and US, and there was a 42% increase in hospitalizations and a 62% increase in [intensive care unit] admissions, compared with November," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general at the World Health Organization. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC, said rates of influenza-like respiratory illness in the community was still increasing in most European countries. "Following relatively low respiratory illness activity over the summer period, consultation rates increased in primary care settings from September," it said in a press release in December. The rates of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases presenting to secondary care were at a level comparable to the same time last year and are now notably increasing in some countries. Flu spike in late December Among those tested, the percentage of people with influenza had increased from 19% in mid-December to almost 25% at the end of the year. Ten countries in Europe, including Italy and Spain, reported seasonal influenza activity above the 10% positivity testing rates in sentinel primary care. But the ECDC said the figures could be affected by the end-of-year holiday season and fail to reveal the real picture — it noted that fewer people got tested during the holiday season. The sharp increase in spread could also be attributed to massive gatherings during Christmas and other festive events, common in Spain. The ECDC said both influenza types A and B had been detected. Swine flu alert in Italy Italy recorded two flu-related deaths in early January in the northeastern city of Vicenza. Doctors suspect the deaths were caused by an outbreak of swine flu, otherwise known as H1N1 influenza. Three other patients are hospitalized in intensive care due to complications, such as interstitial pneumonia, arising from the disease. Local health authorities in Vicenza have appealed to the public to get vaccinated against swine flu. Swine flu is only the most recent addition to existing stresses on Italy's public health system. The Italian National Institute of Health has estimated that around 2 million people were infected with COVID, RSV or influenza in the last two weeks of 2023. Into January, ambulances were seen lining up outside hospitals in Rome. Health care centers in cities like Milan and Turin were overcrowded, with patients waiting for beds. Spain brings back face masks in health care centers Spanish Health Minister Monica Garcia has made it mandatory for all people to wear face masks in health care centers around the country. "[We have to] protect the most vulnerable people," Garcia told reporters. "It's just common sense." Some hospitals in Spain are also struggling to cope with the influx of new patients. The government has said restrictions may be removed if infection rates fall consistently for two weeks. But it's worth noting that Spain was among the last countries to drop face mask regulations during the COVID pandemic.

Viral particles, for instance, can attach to these molecules, called sialic acids, or SAs, like keys fitting into locks. Now, a new study in infant mice shows that keeping virus particles from attaching to SAs limits more than just the entry of influenza A viral infections, but also hinders their exit (shedding) and transmission from mouse to mouse. Such infections are the main cause of the seasonal flu that kills more than 36,000 Americans annually. While vaccines to guard against infection and symptom treatments exist, they are not foolproof, scientists say, and more strategies are needed to prevent infection from spreading. Led by researchers from NYU Grossman School of Medicine, the study team stripped away, or desialylated, SA receptors by placing directly into mouse nasal cavities a neuraminidase enzyme known to loosen the acids' ability to remain attached to cell surfaces. The infant mice were then infected with influenza A. Results showed treatment with the neuraminidase enzyme dramatically cut mouse-to-mouse transmission rates by more than half (from 51% to 100% ) in a half-dozen influenza strains tested. Publishing in the American Society for Microbiology journal mBio online Jan.11, the work was conducted in infant mice, which unlike those even a few months older or adult mice, were found by the research team to have many sialic acids in the upper portion of their respiratory tract. Specifically, the team blocked two SAs, technically called alpha-2,3 SA and alpha-2,6 SA receptors (the locks). These are known to be widely present in the human respiratory tract, which researchers say makes infant mice a strong comparable model for studying the spread of the infectious disease in children, who are also recognized as important "drivers" of flu transmission among people. If further experiments in humans prove successful, desialylating neuraminidase enzymes may prevent the flu from spreading." Mila Ortigoza, MD. PhD., lead study investigator and infectious disease specialist "While current approaches with vaccines and treatments target the virus, ours is the first study to demonstrate that treating the host, either infected mice or potentially infected humans, to prevent them from transmitting the virus to another host could be another effective strategy for combating pervasive infectious diseases," said Ortigoza, who is also an assistant professor in the Departments of Medicine and Microbiology at NYU Langone. Ortigoza cautions that extensive clinical research is needed before neuraminidases can be considered for approval as a treatment in humans. She says the team already has plans for more experiments to examine why infants are more susceptible to infection from respiratory viruses and whether blocking sialic acids in children can also prevent the spread of influenza.

There were 41,000 birds involved.This detection of HPAI is the first time the virus has appeared in the state since December 8, 2023. Wisconsin had five flocks affected by HPAI in 2023 and 11 flocks affected in 2022.This is the first case of HPAI to occur in Washburn County during the 2022-24 outbreak.With this new detection of HPAI, Wisconsin becomes the third state to have a flock infected in 2024. On December 3, the presence of HPAI was confirmed in three commercial poultry operations in California, involving broilers and layer pullets. One day later, the virus was confirmed in a commercial layer pullet flock in Kansas. Collectively, those four flocks involved more than 1.5 million chickens.APHIS has also reported three confirmed cases of HPAI in backyard poultry in the United States in 2024, but in accordance with standards set by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), those cases should not have any impact on international poultry trade.So far in 2024, Canada has only had one instance of HPAI being confirmed in a commercial poultry operation, with that case being confirmed January 3 in Papineau Regional County Municipality, Quebec.To learn more about HPAI cases in commercial poultry flocks in the United States, Mexico and Canada, see an interactive map on WATTPoultry.com.

(WSET) — Influenza activity in Virginia continues to climb as we start the new year, and health officials are warning those numbers could get worse.According to the CDC, the Commonwealth is seeing "very high" levels of flu activity.Dr. Cynthia Morrow, the director of the Roanoke & Alleghany health district for the Virginia Department of Health, said this doesn't come as a surprise, especially considering we just wrapped up the holiday season, a time when cases tend to spike. However, she said we aren't out of the woods yet."We are expecting increased influenza activity for at least the next couple of weeks. Hopefully, it will decrease by the end of January," explained Dr. Morrow.SEE ALSO:911 calls reveal new details in a North Carolina shooting that killed a Halifax County womanSo the question is: is it too late to get your vaccine if you haven't?"It's possible, if you haven't been vaccinated, that even if you got vaccinated today, you'll still get influenza because it takes a little while for that vaccine to kick in, optimally about two weeks," Dr. Morrow said.However, Dr. Morrow still recommends getting vaccinated, since we are in peak activity.To check out the latest influenza numbers in Virginia, click here.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Bringing immunofocusing into focus | npj Vaccines Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

Immunofocusing methods often aim to develop “universal” vaccines that provide broad protection against highly variant viruses such as influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), and most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). We use existing examples to illustrate five main immunofocusing strategies—cross-strain boosting, mosaic display, protein dissection, epitope scaffolding, and epitope masking. We also discuss obstacles for immunofocusing like immune imprinting. A thorough understanding, advancement, and application of the methods we outline here will enable the design of high-resolution vaccines that protect against future viral outbreaks.

There are multiple examples where passive transfer of mAbs has been shown to provide protection against viral disease, and in some cases to provide broad-spectrum protection against multiple viral strains, such as nirsevimab for RSV and VRC01 for HIV1,2,3. These provide rationale for developing vaccines that could elicit a neutralizing antibody response mimicking the protective mAb4,5. However, attempts to redirect the immune response towards the epitope targeted by a known mAb have not yet been shown to produce broadly effective vaccines against any virus in a clinical setting6,7.This lack of success can be attributed in large part to a phenomenon called immunodominance. Immunodominance describes the heightened prevalence of antibodies directed towards specific epitopes; the resulting immune pressure drives positive selection of strain-specific antibodies against these epitopes8. While immunodominance is not well-understood, it is thought to be influenced by several factors including epitope accessibility and flexibility9, affinity/avidity of the initial B cell-antigen or peptide-MHC interaction that mediates T cell help, germline B cell precursor frequency10, and clonal deletion of autoreactive Abs11,12,13. Consistent with these notions, the evolution of broadly-neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) often utilizes germline alleles that are rare in humans and requires extensive somatic hypermutation (SHM) as compared to typical strain-specific antibodies14. bnAbs also frequently target regions of viral proteins that tend to be less accessible or that elicit lower-affinity antibodies, making it challenging to reliably elicit bnAbs with vaccination15,16.Specifically for influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), the major glycoprotein responsible for binding and fusion to host cells, most bnAbs are known to target the stem region17,18, which is highly conserved but induces fewer B cells than the exposed, variable, immunodominant head region19,20, which elicits the primary strain-specific response. Historic challenges associated with universal vaccine development for influenza virus have been reviewed comprehensively by others21. Additionally, while much attention in the literature is given to bnAbs against HIV-1 Env, these antibodies are very rare; the overwhelming majority of antibodies elicited by vaccination or HIV-1 infection are against immunodominant, strain-specific Env epitopes22,23,24.First discussed over 25 years ago, immunofocusing seeks to address these challenges to developing protective antibodies25. The essential concept of immunofocusing is to diminish B cell responses against off-target, non-neutralizing, subtype-specific, or other undesirable immunodominant epitopes, and towards a specific desirable target epitope25,26,27. The primary goal of immunofocusing is to redirect the immune response towards epitopes defined by mAbs, and away from immunodominant, non-productive responses, including the elicitation of non-neutralizing off-target antibodies that may cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease, or epitope-dependent autoimmune reactions28,29. The role of T cells, which are also involved in broadening immunity, has been discussed in detail elsewhere30,31,32.Using protein engineering and unique delivery strategies to alter the exposure of desired mAb epitopes will be critical in approaching this problem and developing vaccine candidates. A major consideration for these approaches is the ability to generate vaccine candidates with differing levels of exposure of the desired epitope(s) on the protein, relative to the size and immunostimulatory potential of all exposed epitope(s)- referred to here as immunofocusing resolution. A lower-resolution vaccine exposes more epitopes outside that of the target epitope(s) or masks the off-target epitopes to a lesser degree, while a higher-resolution vaccine exposes fewer off-target epitopes and more efficiently masks them. Masking approaches aim to decrease the immunogenicity of specific epitopes, through modifications such as glycosylation. Given that bnAbs and non-neutralizing antibodies can share overlapping epitopes33,34, resolution is a critical consideration for the design of immunofocused vaccines that are broadly protective. We postulate that the ideal universal vaccine would employ the highest-resolution possible, exposing only the footprint of a neutralizing mAb that targets an evolutionarily conserved epitope in its native state.In this review, we discuss five primary methods of immunofocusing with varying resolution: cross-strain boosting, mosaic display, protein dissection, epitope scaffolding, and epitope masking (Fig. 1). We have selected a handful of studies that illustrate the strengths and shortcomings of each method. Our review complements several concepts that are well-covered by the recent review by Caradonna & Schmidt35, including multimeric display, stabilization of the prefusion conformation of viral immunogens, and germline-targeting antigens. Rather, we highlight the concepts of resolution, scaffold immunity, the distinction between free and antibody-bound epitope conformations in engineered immunogens, as well as control experiments to guide iterative vaccine design that should be considered when adopting immunofocusing methods.Fig. 1: High-resolution immunofocusing.a The ideal broadly-protective immunogen elicits high titers of antibodies directed against the epitope of interest while avoiding antibody responses against off-target immunodominant epitopes. In the context of highly mutable viruses, this target epitope is defined by the binding footprint of a broadly neutralizing antibody (shown in red). Green represents off-target, exposed antigenic surfaces that are still capable of eliciting antibodies, while gray represents masked regions. b–f Five major classes of immunofocusing strategies: cross-strain boosting, mosaic display, protein dissection, epitope scaffolding, and epitope masking.Full size imageA note on original antigenic sinAn individual’s first exposure to a virus or immunogen shapes the responses to subsequent exposures36, a phenomenon known as immune imprinting or original antigenic sin (OAS)37. OAS is particularly well characterized for influenza virus38,39. Molecular fate mapping techniques to quantify OAS show suppression of de novo antibody responses by existing immunity that varies as a function of antigenic distance between the strains used to prime and boost40.The ability to develop immunofocusing vaccines that are generally efficacious will need to account for, and in some cases overcome, preexisting immunity41. Oftentimes immunofocused antigens are tested in animal models that are näive to the pathogen of interest, which is not representative of previous exposures in humans that may skew the immune response. As well, new insights into germinal center dynamics in humans that seek to define mechanisms of immunodominance should inform childhood versus adult immunization schedules of immunofocusing vaccines as they advance clinically42,43. For instance, antibodies produced upon vaccination against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 showed a strain-specific response bias towards the immunodominant head, and limited development of a vaccine-induced response to stem epitopes in individuals with high pre-existing antibody levels, while low pre-existing antibody levels against the vaccinating strain was correlated with a stem-directed response44. Currently, infants are simply immunized with the latest influenza vaccine, with no regard for patterns of immunodominance. An immunofocused vaccine targeted to prime the development of stem-directed antibodies during infancy may prove fruitful towards shaping a long-lasting cross-reactive humoral response. Similar considerations have been discussed with regard to infant immunization with COVID-19 vaccines45.Cross-strain boostingCross-strain boosting involves sequential immunization with antigenically distinct versions of the same protein—with the aim of boosting cross-reactive B cells that outpace the strain-specific responses (Fig. 1b). Cross-strain boosting has been widely tested preclinically, but as with most immunofocusing methods, its primary applications have been against HIV-1 and influenza virus46,47,48, both of which are highly variable viruses with many different circulating strains. Early studies investigated sequential immunizations with different strains of disulfide-stabilized soluble gp140 trimers of HIV-1 Env (SOSIP), or with progressive boosts with zoonotic strains of influenza virus HA, and reported increased efficacy over single administration with multiple strains or sequential immunizations with the same strain49,50.Another example from Luo et al. used cross-strain boosting of virus-like particles (VLPs) containing either group 1 HA (H1, H8, H13) or group 2 HA (H3, H4, H10) in a challenge model51. Sequential vaccination with distinct VLPs provided improved protection compared to immunizations with a mixture of VLPs. The mixture of VLPs is an important control for any study testing the success of cross-strain boosting to support the conclusion that there is preferential boosting of cross-reactive B cells, as opposed to individual strain-specific B cells against each variant (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2: Cross-strain boosting and mosaic display.a In cross-strain boosting, antigenically distinct versions of the same protein are used for immunization. Varying the sequence in which antigen is administered can skew the antibody response and its breadth of neutralization, depending on which antigen is used as the prime52. To validate a multi-injection immunization schedule, cross-strain boosting studies should include a control where a mixture of heterologous antigens (each color represents a different strain of virus) is administered alongside antigens administered sequentially. This deconvolutes a poly-clonal strain-specific response from a cross-reactive response. b It is also the case with cross-strain boosting that a control mixture of homologous nanoparticles should be compared against immunization with mosaic nanoparticles to demonstrate increased neutralization breadth. Multivalent antigen display ideally preferentially elicits high avidity antibodies that cross-link adjacent antigens against the target epitope. c Strain-specific antibodies that are stimulated by adjacent homologous antigens at the surface of the nanoparticle can theoretically be minimized by increasing the number of variants displayed. This remains to be proven in an experimental setting.Full size imageVan Reeth et al., tested sequential immunization with two H3 HA subtypes that shared ~80% sequence identity—one from Europe (G08 strain) and one from North America (PA10)50. Sequential immunization again performed better than a mixture of the two, stimulating higher antibody titers against divergent viruses. Following up on this work, Chepkwony et al. investigated if immunogen order altered the overall response52. The authors exposed pigs to the H3N2 A/Nanchang/933/1995 strain and then vaccinated with G08 followed by PA10 H3N2 or vice versa. The latter yielded better responses than the inverse. These results support the long-standing hypothesis of immunological imprinting or OAS, where immunogen order dictates responses (Fig. 2a)36. Similarly in humans, initial administration of an H7N9 antigen elicits a response with a greater breadth of neutralization than when an H5N1 antigen is administered first53.In a conceptually similar method, Krammer and colleagues constructed chimeric HAs where the stem domains remained constant, but the head domains were derived from different strains. The authors found in a Phase I study that immunization with chimeric HAs redirected antibodies away from the immunodominant head and towards the conserved stem54. Passive transfer of antiserum from patients primed with chimeric H5 and boosted with H8 resulted in protection in mice against challenge with a heterologous virus.Such clinical trial data is critical to support the use of cross-strain boosting for other viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. However, because cross-strain boosting does not shield off-target responses, it may not be ideal in all contexts. For instance, Jegaskanda et al. showed in non-human primates (NHPs) that sequential administration of an H5N1 vaccine followed by a seasonal vaccine can increase the stem-domain-directed response but the overall response is still dominated by a head-domain-specific response55.A practical concern for cross-strain boosting is the requirement for multiple injections of distinct antigens over time, each of which are likely to require separate approval for clinical use. This complicates vaccination strategies, especially in resource-poor settings. Studies to improve the viability of the strategy include utilizing slow-release gels or patches with differing controlled distribution kinetics to sequentially release multiple strains following only a single injection56,57,58.Mosaic displayA second approach to immunofocusing is mosaic display (Fig. 1c). Mosaic display positions antigenically distinct versions of a protein on the same multivalent scaffold. Unlike multivalent display of homologous components59,60,61,62, mosaic display aims to specifically stimulate cross-reactive B cells since they can simultaneously engage common, targeted regions of the heterologous antigens (Fig. 2c).Kanekiyo et al. demonstrated this effect by producing multivalent nanoparticles displaying receptor binding domains (RBDs - monomeric head regions) from an array of historic HA proteins63. The mosaic nanoparticle showed improved activity over either sequential immunization of homotypic nanoparticles or immunization with a mixture of homotypic nanoparticles. Again, the latter control was critical; comparison between immunization with the mosaic and immunization with a mixture of homotypic nanoparticles demonstrates that the improved activity from the mosaic sample was due to the geometry of the mosaic and not due to its multivalency. The authors further discussed the importance of nanoparticle geometry—specifically that mosaics should have no adjacent homologous antigens that could promote a strain-specific response. Given that the nanoparticles in Kanekiyo et al. were made via random assembly, increased antigen density and diversity decreases the likelihood of adjacent homologous antigens (Fig. 2c). Follow-up work by Kanekiyo demonstrated that mosaic immunogens displaying the four HA trimers found within the licensed quadrivalent flu vaccine elicited greater protection against vaccine-mismatched and heterosubtypic group 1 and 2 viruses when compared with immunization of a cocktail of homotypic nanoparticles64.Separately, utilizing full-length HA trimers, Cohen et al. found that mosaic nanoparticles did not elicit broader immunity than the mixture of homotypic particles65, again highlighting the importance of this control (Fig. 2b). A potential explanation for the difference in neutralization breadth between the Kanekiyo and Cohen studies comes from the nanoparticle geometry, as Kanekiyo used monomeric RBDs expressed as genetic fusions to ferritin, and Cohen used full-length HA trimers conjugated via SpyCatcher-SpyTag. The latter increases distance between neighboring antigens and results in low conjugation efficiency, potentially mitigating some of the B cell activation potency conferred by multimeric antigen display66.The mosaic display approach holds particular promise in light of the finding that mosaic SARS-CoV-2 RBD nanoparticles developed by Cohen et al. and further validated by Fan et al. were shown to protect against challenge by diverse sarbecoviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2), while homotypic RBD nanoparticles protected only against SARS-CoV-2 challenge67,68. Epitope mapping of serum from mosaic-immunized animals demonstrated targeting of conserved epitopes, confirming a plausible mechanism to overcome immunodominance of highly variable RBD regions68. However, neither study compares the performance of a cocktail of homotypic nanoparticles to the corresponding mosaic nanoparticle, and thus it remains unclear the extent to which mosaic display enhances the breadth of the immune response against sarbecovirus RBDs. These nanoparticles also failed to provide protection against the SARS-CoV-2 BA.1 variant (Omicron), suggesting that neutralization of animal sarbecoviruses is not predictive of protection against closely related human variants of SARS-CoV-2 given differences in selective pressure on the virus.As with cross-strain boosting, mosaic display does not mask off-target epitopes. Therefore, it is possible for immunodominant, strain-specific epitopes to still overwhelm the response at the expense of Abs against the conserved target epitope. Considering for instance that mosaic molecules made from similar proteins may elicit off-target antibodies, while those made from highly-divergent proteins may be unable to stimulate cross-reactive germline B cells, identifying the optimal sequence variation, geometry and density of displayed immunogens will be critical41,62. This includes ongoing efforts to design multi-component nanoparticle scaffolds to enable finer control over heterogeneous antigen assembly69.Protein dissectionA third immunofocusing method, protein dissection involves protein engineering to remove unwanted epitopes (Fig. 3a). It is the first method we discuss that actively discourages the elicitation of off-target antibodies, and is thus particularly useful for antigens with non-neutralizing immunodominant regions (Fig. 1d). Most studies that have applied protein dissection fall into two categories: 1) loop deletion: a long flexible loop within the protein is replaced with a shorter, more rigid structure, or 2) domain removal: an entire domain of the protein is removed, and the remaining structure is stabilized.Fig. 3: Protein dissection and epitope scaffolding.a Protein dissection can be an effective strategy to remove immunodominant regions and avoid undesirable antibody responses. b In protein dissection, native domains of the protein are replaced with non-native stretches of amino acids to stabilize the remaining structure. This can form neoepitopes that elicit undesirable antibody responses (grey) while leaving non-target regions of the native protein exposed (green). c Epitope-scaffolded immunogens can elicit antibodies directed towards the biologically irrelevant scaffold (grey) or the epitope-scaffold interface (green) that could skew the humoral response away from the desired epitope. d Confirming binding of the target Ab for the immunofocusing antigen is insufficient for characterizing how well it recapitulates the native antigen. This is because bnAb binding may shift the equilibrium of a distorted structure towards the native state. This distortion can be monitored by quantifying differences in affinity and structure.Full size imageLoop deletionLoop deletion has primarily been applied to HIV-1, where flexible, hypervariable loops are thought to block neutralizing epitopes on Env, or where the loops themselves are immunodominant70,71. The rationale originates from early experiments demonstrating that removal of these loops increased affinity of neutralizing antibodies directed towards the CD4 binding site72. Several groups have explored the role of V1/V2 deletions on neutralization breadth and immunogenicity of HIV-1 vaccines73,74. However, these studies have not yet translated effectively to human studies. For example, a phase I immunization trial with trimeric gp140 with deletion of the V2 loop—a region identified to elicit high levels of non-neutralizing antibodies—demonstrated no improvement in neutralization breadth75. Loop deletion may remain a viable strategy for viruses with less stringent immunodominance hierarchies.Domain removalWhile conceptually similar to loop deletion, removal of whole domains has a significantly larger impact on the antigenicity of the protein but may be necessary when deletion of only flexible loops is insufficient to avoid undesirable immune responses. This method has been explored in several different contexts including HIV-176, RSV (head-only)77, and SARS-CoV-2 RBD78, among others, with varying success towards advancing to efficacy in patients.Recent work by our lab showed that deletion of an immunodominant79,80,81, flexible, 70 amino acid region (which encompasses a large portion of the HR2 domain) from the C-terminus of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain results in an immunogen that elicits improved neutralizing activity compared to the full-length ectodomain - an effect that was particularly pronounced in multivalent immunogens45,82. Stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S2, which comprises the more conserved domain of the spike ectodomain, was also shown recently to elicit protective antibody responses in preclinical animal models83.Unlike domains that are formed by a single stretch of amino acids (such as the RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 spike), some domains require more extensive engineering to stabilize the remaining structure. For example, through successive iterations of design, several groups have generated stabilized stem domains capable of mimicking the native stem by removing the variable head domain of influenza virus HA84,85,86,87,88. In one such case, short flexible loops were installed in place of the head domain, and the resulting H1 HA-stabilized stem was then multimerized onto a nanoparticle which displayed eight copies of the trimeric stabilized-stem, termed H1-ss-NP85. Passive transfer of serum from mice immunized with H1-ss-NP showed promise in a challenge model against heterologous H5N1, and this construct has now progressed into multiple phase 1 clinical trials89,90.However, this particular stabilized stem construct faces several challenges including that the base of the stabilized stem trimer is splayed apart compared to the native structure, based on structures solved by cryo-EM and crystallography85. This seems to be responsible for differences in stem-directed mAb affinity for native HA and H1-ss-NP. Several groups developing headless HA immunogens have also identified a discrepancy between the robust cross-reactive binding and weaker, more subtype-specific, neutralizing activity of serum elicited by headless constructs84,87. Yassine et al. proposed that this results from the fact that the target bnAb epitope on the stem only constitutes about 15% of the surface area of the resultant stabilized stem85, such that a large portion of the response is likely directed at cross-reactive, but non-neutralizing epitopes. Additionally, domain removal may expose neoepitopes that are not representative of the native antigen (Fig. 3b). Thus, stabilized stem constructs may benefit from higher resolution immunogen engineering.Another visible application of domain removal are the eOD-GT immunogens, which display the HIV-1 CD4-binding site (CD4bs) epitope on a minimal engineered outer domain91. Iterative mutations were made to create eOD-GT8, which binds with relatively high affinity to the CD4bs-directed bnAb VRC01 and its germline precursor. This was then multimerized onto a lumazine synthase nanoparticle to display 60 copies on a single particle to boost immunogenicity91. eOD-GT8 activates B cells displaying the purported VRC01 germline and was used to isolate precursor B cells from naive donors92. Preliminary phase 1 results suggest that this candidate may stimulate epitope-specific responses93.However, eOD-GT8 demonstrates several obstacles that generalize more broadly to protein dissection, namely, that epitope context may play an important role in antibody-mediated neutralization. Many antibodies elicited by the eOD are directed to regions outside of the grafted CD4-binding site (CD4bs), and those that do recognize the CD4bs epitope bind to the native SOSIP trimers weakly91. Several possibilities explain this outcome: the angle of approach for the elicited antibodies is incompatible with the native trimer due to clashes with neighboring Env subunits, and/or the target epitope is not sufficiently immunogenic relative to the available off-target epitopes to elicit enough target-specific antibodies with detectable neutralization94.Epitope scaffoldingAn alternative and theoretically higher-resolution method of immunofocusing is epitope scaffolding. Epitope scaffolding translocates the epitope of interest from its native context onto a different scaffold. This may involve transplanting the epitope into either (1) an existing but evolutionarily distant or orthogonal structural homolog, or (2) a novel designed scaffold. Scaffolding is easiest when a high-resolution structure of the epitope exists, and the epitope itself is rigid and easily delineated from the rest of the antigen (e.g., a contiguous stretch of amino acids rather than a complex conformational epitope).Epitope scaffolding is particularly useful when immunofocusing towards transiently exposed epitopes that are not readily accessible on the native antigen95,96. For instance, peptide mimetics of the gp41 prehairpin intermediate enable stable display of an epitope that is transiently exposed upon transition from prefusion to the postfusion state of HIV-1 Env97.Structural homolog scaffoldsIn general, identifying structural homologs for use as an alternative scaffold involves scanning structural databases for proteins with similar folds to the original epitope and has been done to target the HIV-1 membrane-proximal external region (MPER) and other HIV-1 epitopes95,98,99,100. For example, Stanfield et al. used the MPER-directed bnAb Z13e1 as a guide to identify interleukin 22 (IL-22) as an orthogonal structural homolog with a similar epitope fold to the antibody-bound structure101. The authors then grafted the MPER epitope onto the homologous region of IL-22 and showed Z13e1 Ab bound to the grafted protein. However, using isothermal calorimetry, the authors found that the interaction of Z13e1 with the epitope-scaffolded immunogen did not use a lock-and-key recognition mechanism, as is common for antibodies. Instead, it seemed to require a binding-induced conformational rearrangement, implying that the antibody binding was shifting the equilibrium to “pull” the protein into the correct conformation102. More explicitly, a high affinity Ab could be capable of binding a distorted epitope due to thermodynamic favorability. A distorted epitope, however, decreases the likelihood of eliciting the desired humoral response, as it fails to capture the native epitope that the host would encounter upon infection (Fig. 3d). Indeed, this construct failed to elicit a neutralizing response upon immunization.Separate efforts to graft MPER epitopes have failed to elicit a neutralizing response as well103. This may be partly due to the intrinsic flexibility of the MPER epitope, which has been shown to adopt different conformations when bound to different bnAbs104. It is possible that flexible epitopes are poor candidates for epitope scaffolding. Studies have also shown that MPER-directed Abs rely more on lipid interactions, which are not included in the scaffolded epitope105, highlighting another key consideration—epitope context. Such interactions with the lipid bilayer or with glycans may be important for the antibody binding and may not be captured by a scaffolded epitope.The Stanfield et al. work highlights another consideration: namely that bnAb binding to a vaccine candidate is not a sufficient indicator that the vaccine candidate displays the proper epitope conformation to elicit the bnAb (Fig. 3d). Indeed, this challenge is shared among all the immunofocusing methods we discuss here. Biophysical approaches to identify potential discrepancies between the free epitope and the antibody-bound epitope include isothermal calorimetry, X-ray crystallography/cryo-EM, biolayer interferometry, competition enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, and protein thermal melts (Table 1), since they allow the quantitation of how well an immunogen mimics the native epitope and can thus guide iterative development prior to immunization in animals.Table 1 Biophysical characterization that aids in iterative immunogen design.Full size tableEpitope scaffolding is poised for rapid advancement in the coming years. So far, it has been mainly limited by the requirement for structural knowledge gained from crystallography/cryo-EM structures. Tools such as AlphaFold and ESM-fold should accelerate the discovery of greater and more diverse scaffolds, as well as tools to generate novel sequences that fold into specific conformations106,107.De novo designed scaffoldsFor some target epitopes, it may not be possible to identify ideal homologous structures to recapitulate the original epitope. In such instances, de novo design and computational protein folding techniques can be used to develop novel scaffolds that display the target epitope. Early reports of this approach suggest that it is more straightforward to graft a linear/continuous epitope108,109, but recent advances in computation as well as integrating design with directed evolution have enabled grafting of not only linear, but also discontinuous epitopes on to protein scaffolds110,111,112.In the case of RSV, immunization with epitope-scaffold candidates based on the fusion glycoprotein epitope of the bnAb motavizumab elicited antibodies that were able to bind to the F protein of RSV but were unable to neutralize the virus109. This was not wholly unexpected, as the authors noted that the bnAb had a lower affinity for the scaffold compared to the full-length antigen by orders of magnitude, suggesting improper display of the native epitope.Epitope maskingThe final, and theoretically highest-resolution immunofocusing method is epitope masking. Epitope masking uses biochemical modifications to shield off-target epitopes. Its high resolution arises because modifications can be made directly adjacent to, but not in, the target epitope. This approach often utilizes the full-length protein such that the structure of the target epitope is largely unperturbed, increasing the likelihood of eliciting bnAbs against the desired epitope. An example of epitope masking—antigen reorientation—was recently pioneered by our lab and others. We installed aluminum hydroxide (Alum) binding oligo-aspartate peptide loops onto the head domain of HA, thereby inverting it on the Alum surface to generate reorientated HA (reoHA)113. ReoHA elicits robustly cross-reactive and stem-specific responses compared to WT HA. An alternative approach used a streptavidin VLP to bind biotinylated HA in an inverted orientation114.Glycan repositioningWhile epitope masking can be implemented in a variety of ways, the most common approach is glycan repositioning or, more specifically, hyperglycosylation115 via introduction of N-linked glycan consensus sequences116. Given their bulky, flexible nature, glycans are capable of sterically occluding epitopes. Indeed, viruses naturally utilize glycans to obscure epitopes and evade immunity117. Thus, the application of glycan repositioning is a natural choice for developing various potential vaccines, including for influenza virus118,119, HIV-1120,121,122,123, SARS-CoV-2124, and RSV125.Early examples of glycan repositioning include the introduction of single glycan modifications that could redirect the immune response elicited by HA118,119,126, as well as the addition of N-linked glycans to dampen the immune response against the V3 loop on Env70. Subsequent adaptation of this approach produced a hyperglycosylated form of gp120 of HIV-1 Env, which retained binding to the neutralizing mAb b12 but reduced the binding of non-neutralizing antibodies121. This design was the result of iterative improvements to include additional glycosylation sites, and to remove a single glycosylation site and a fragment of the N-terminus. The resulting hyperglycosylated gp120 ultimately led to an overall dampening of the immune response, but did not improve the elicitation of b12-like antibodies121, again highlighting that in vitro antibody binding is not necessarily representative of in vivo elicitation of the humoral response.Similar efforts to alter glycosylation profiles have been made by others to engineer HIV-1 immunogens127. Most of these studies applied iterative design informed by a panel of antibodies targeting on and off-target regions, a technique that is important not only for epitope-masked immunogens, but for evaluating the antigenicity of all immunofocused antigens.Antigen resurfacingAntigen resurfacing introduces amino acid variations to regions outside of the target epitope with the goal of altering the immune profile of the antigen, ideally skewing the immune response towards the epitope of interest25. The first decisive example was applied to a model antigen, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), in which a single Arg to Glu substitution at position 68 shifted the resultant humoral immune response128. Resurfacing has since been applied to HIV, dengue, and other viruses with limited success33,129. While resurfacing modifications can alter the immune response of antigens, it is difficult to render these regions fully immunosilent.Despite these setbacks, resurfacing remains an attractive method because of the simplicity of installing conservative, small substitutions, many of which can be accommodated on a single protein130. Future applications will likely take advantage of recent advances that have enabled our understanding of the entire sequence space and structural features of SARS-CoV-2 spike, HIV-1 Env, and other proteins by deep-scanning mutagenesis131.PEG modifications and PMDInstallation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties is another form of epitope masking. Pioneering work by Davis and colleagues demonstrated many advantages of PEGylation for therapeutic applications, one of which is that PEGylated proteins are significantly less immunogenic than their non-PEGylated counterparts132. The first PEGylated therapeutic proteins, PEG-adenosine deaminase for adenosine deaminase deficiency133 and PEG-asparaginase for acute lymphoblastic leukemia134, support the notion that PEG can selectively dampen the immune response.Inspired by this use of PEG in drug design and a proof-of-concept of immunosilencing in peptide vaccines95, our lab developed an immunofocusing method termed protect, modify, deprotect (PMD) (Fig. 4)135. PMD is simply applied– first, the target epitope is protected by a mAb and next, amino acids with functional handles outside of the antibody-antigen interface are covalently modified with short PEG chains. Finally, the mAb is dissociated, thereby exposing the target-epitope. Because PMD immunogens are typically full-length proteins, and made in the presence of the target antibody, the conformational integrity of the epitope is retained.Fig. 4: Protect, modify, deprotect (PMD).a A general schematic of the PMD strategy. First, the epitope is protected by the target Ab (shown in red). Then the surfaces of the protein complex are modified by PEG to render them non-immunogenic (shown in grey). Finally, the epitope is deprotected by the removal of the Ab. b Iterative antigen engineering is required to successively increase the resolution of epitope masking. Holes represent insufficiently masked regions of the antigen and can be characterized using binding experiments with a panel of known off-target antibodies.Full size imageOur initial test case utilized a stem-directed antibody as the protecting antibody to produce PMD-HA, which retained binding of stem-directed antibodies, but not head-directed antibodies, as intended. Immunization with PMD-HA promoted a more cross-reactive, stem-directed response. We did, however, identify a ‘hole’ in our epitope mask—a region, outside of the epitope of interest, to which antibodies could still bind (Fig. 4b), highlighting the need to evaluate the binding properties of epitope-masked immunogens with panels of off-target antibodies.A common occurrence and key consideration in epitope masking is the overall decreased immunogenicity of the immunogens—reducing the immunogenicity of off-target epitopes, can also decrease the immunostimulatory potential of the entire protein, resulting in lower antibody titers. Thus, further optimization may be required to increase the overall immunogenicity of these masked proteins, via adjuvants or other excipients136. Additionally, applications of epitope masking may be most effective for antigens where the off-target epitopes may induce a detrimental immune response.Synergy between Immunfocusing methodsMost immunofocusing methods in this review are orthogonal to one another—meaning they can be applied sequentially or simultaneously to further improve resolution. A good example is the hyperglycosylation of the scaffolded immunogen eOD-GT8 that accurately displays the CD4bs, but elicits anti-scaffold Abs. This has been mitigated with epitope masking in the form of hyperglycosylation of the scaffold at immunogenic regions137. Similarly, anti-scaffold immunity could be avoided through a combination of scaffolding and resurfacing. For instance, scaffolded gp120 was resurfaced by mutating 50 residues outside of the 4E10 footprint, which improved thermostability and maintained Ab binding110. Mosaic display and protein dissection have also been combined in recent work by Cohen et al. to produce nanoparticles displaying RBDs from eight different zoonotic coronavirus proteins138. Immunization of the mosaic produced broader anti-coronavirus responses compared to the WT homosubtypic nanoparticle.While these represent a subset of the previously explored synergies, we hypothesize that there can be many more. For example, combining hyperglycosylation and PMD could be a promising method to mask more epitope “holes.” Alternatively, antigen reorientation of scaffolded immunogens may better display the target epitope and mitigate the elicitation of off-target epitopes. We envision that combinations of immunofocusing methods can quickly improve neutralization breadth.ConclusionsWhile each of these five methods has different advantages and complexities, there are a number of universal considerations when applying immunofocusing methods. Immunofocusing relies upon proper conformational display of the target epitope in its native state. Target antibody binding to an immunogen is not sufficient to demonstrate that the bound state has the same conformation as the free antigen because the antibody may pull the distorted epitope into the native conformation. Additionally, for viruses where it is particularly difficult to develop bnAbs, high resolution immunofocusing and careful iterative development using a panel of antibodies with known epitopes may be required. During this process, however, it is important to avoid the creation of novel neoepitopes or scaffold immunity. These considerations will be important for the development of novel, effective immunofocusing vaccines.The choice of immunofocusing methods will depend upon the specific antigen. For instance, low-resolution focusing may be sufficient for HA due to the clear delineation between the immunodominant head and conserved stem domains. Epitope scaffolding is more straightforward for simple linear epitopes such as the helix-turn-helix motavizumab epitope of RSV, rather than complex conformational epitopes such as the VRC01 epitope of HIV-1. In general, while immunofocusing with the highest possible resolution is desirable, this must be weighed against practical challenges such as the overall reduced immunostimulatory potential of the immunogen, and perturbations to the epitope structure which especially accompany methods such as protein dissection and epitope scaffolding. Considerations about which method or methods to apply in which context will also be critical to avoid off-target responses. Advances in computational methods to predict viral escape and mimic epitopes using de novo protein design will also continue to enhance immunofocused vaccine development139.The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has made clear the necessity to develop universal vaccines against potential pandemic viruses and their variants140,141. Immunofocusing against potential pandemic viruses may be a way to mitigate future risks. Indeed, it is likely that we will require significantly higher resolution immunofocusing—perhaps that of a specific antibody epitope(s)—in order to provide broad protection and prepare for future pandemics. The improvement of current methods, and their synergistic applications, as well as the development of novel methodologies, have made the prospect of high-resolution immunofocusing more tractable than ever.

Thus, during the first week of 2024 there has been a decrease in the primary care rate for influenza: 387 cases per 100,000 inhabitants compared to 430 cases the previous week. This is the first decrease in incidence in four weeks. SMC Spain 11/01/2024 - 17:15 CET Versión en castellano General view of workers and users of a health center in the Valencian Community. EFE/Biel Aliño. Expert reactions Inmaculada Casas - gripe SiVIRA Inmaculada Casas Head of the Respiratory Virus and Influenza Research Group of the Carlos III Health Institute Health Institute Carlos III Science Media Centre Spain Respiratory viruses circulating during an epidemic season of respiratory infection allow us to know the dynamics of most acute respiratory infections that in some cases cause hospitalization due to their severity. Viral detection is performed by genetic analysis systems of one or several viruses simultaneously (RT-PCR), which are increasingly sensitive, influencing the reduction and elimination of unnecessary antibiotic treatments or the implementation of a specific antiviral treatment and its duration. The analysis of influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus simultaneously in the laboratories of the different Autonomous Communities generates a specific knowledge of the circulation of each one of them, being the positivity rates to these three viruses one of the markers of the evolution of acute respiratory infections in each of the epidemic seasons. Apart from the positivity rates, knowledge of the biological and genetic characteristics of the circulating viruses adds to the surveillance system basic information for decision making affecting the control of respiratory infection in the population. After the 2020 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was included in influenza surveillance, extending such surveillance to acute respiratory infection and, as another respiratory virus, its molecular characterization allows us to associate the appearance and circulation of certain lineages, currently the omicron variant, to infection rates in both sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance analyses. In addition, influenza viruses undergo genetic and antigenic changes, and we can say that sentinel genomic virological surveillance systems have been strengthened in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic. This season, influenza A/H1N1 viruses are dominant and mostly similar to the A/H1 vaccine component. However, when analyzing the circulating A/H3N2 viruses, which are in the minority, it is observed that they belong to a different genetic group from the group of the vaccine virus in its A/H3 component. Antigenic studies are currently underway. The integration of the three respiratory viruses through the detection of the new SARS-CoV-2 lineages, the sequencing of influenza in a systematic way with the characterization of its 8 segments of both influenza A and B, and finally the characterization of the possible escape of Respiratory Syncytial Virus to monoclonal antibodies used this season as immunoprophylaxis (Nirsevimab) for the prevention of bronchiolitis, are the main virological novelties presented in the current epidemic season. Participa en la elaboración del informe SiVIRA. Language EN Amparo Larrauri - gripe EN Amparo Larrauri Head of the Influenza and other Respiratory Virus Surveillance Group of the National Epidemiology Centre. Health Institute Carlos III National Centre of Epidemiology (CNE) Science Media Centre Spain The emergence of covid-19 caused a change in the seasonal behavior of respiratory viruses that led to a change in the approach of historical influenza surveillance systems, to become comprehensive surveillance systems for respiratory pathogens. In Spain, following the recommendations of the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), the implementation of the Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance System (SiVIRA) was initiated in October 2020. SiVIRA consists of the sentinel surveillance system for mild acute respiratory infection (ARI) in primary care and the surveillance system for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in hospitals. The surveillance of ARIs and SARI arose from the adaptation and previous experience of the Influenza Surveillance System in Spain (SVGE) and aims to lay the foundations of a stable comprehensive respiratory surveillance, with the will to last over time, which will allow surveillance of several respiratory pathogens and any other respiratory virus that may emerge in the future. The objective of SiVIRA is to monitor the evolution of acute respiratory infections in Primary Care and hospitals, identifying unexpected patterns that may serve as a warning signal, as well as to monitor epidemics of influenza, covid-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Surveillance of ARIs or ARRIs starts with the capture through the health system of "clinical syndromes" that respond to an acute respiratory infection of any etiology and the systematic selection of a sample of ARI or ARRI patients for the triple microbiological diagnosis of influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV. The system can describe the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of these respiratory agents, as well as contribute to the evaluation of the effectiveness of control and prevention measures, especially vaccines. Each SiVIRA surveillance season covers a full year, from October of one year to September of the following year. With the exception of the first 2020-21 season, in which the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 almost completely displaced the rest of the respiratory viruses, in the rest up to the current 2023-24 season, the three viruses that SiVIRA monitors in a more specific way have circulated, in addition to other respiratory viruses: influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The temporal presentation of these three viruses has been different for each of them and also in each season, giving rise to different epidemic waves of influenza, covid-19 and RSV infection for which SiVIRA has provided timely information on their evolution and epidemiological and virological characteristics in space and time. In the 2023-24 season, we find simultaneous circulation of influenza, SARS-COV-2 and RSV, a typical situation for this winter season, with the difference that since 2020 SARS-CoV-2 joins as a travel companion to the respiratory virus season. However, the particularity of the last four weeks is that influenza has shown a greater intensity of circulation than the other two viruses, giving rise to a steep upward slope in the incidence of influenza in Primary Care, which decreases for the first time in the first week of January 2024. This change in trend could signal that the peak of influenza activity in the last week of 2023 has been exceeded and, if surveillance data confirm this in the coming week, will begin to decline progressively thereafter. Comparison of these influenza incidences with historical influenza series before the covid-19 pandemic requires complex analysis, taking into account the change in surveillance systems before and after the covid-19 emergency. When appropriate analytical adjustments are made, we see that, at the peak of activity this season, influenza has reached a high level of transmissibility, albeit in the upper range of pre- and post-pandemic influenza epidemics. A situation not extraordinary that we have seen in historical flu seasons such as 2014-15. The high transmissibility of influenza in the community is undoubtedly influencing the fact that hospitalization due to influenza continues to rise, especially in people over 60 years of age, although so far no parameters have been observed that indicate greater severity than in previous seasons. Nevertheless, SiVIRA must maintain timely and accurate surveillance as it has done up to now, to identify any factors that may be associated with situations of complications of influenza infection or other respiratory viruses. Hospitalization due to covid-19 is at lower levels than in the two previous seasons, which speaks, in addition to a level of natural immunity due to previous infections, of the success of the national covid-19 vaccination program since its inception. Also in the case of hospitalization due to RSV infection, hospital morbidity is lower than in previous seasons, which may be influenced both by the immunity acquired by the intense epidemic of bronchiolitis in children last season, and by the impact of immunization with the monoclonal antibody Nirsevimab, which has been administered for the first time this season in children under six months of age, for the prevention of hospitalization due to RSV infection. In the current situation of high circulation of respiratory viruses in the community, it is very convenient to maintain personal respiratory hygiene measures to try to reduce transmission at the population level. And it is very important to administer the influenza vaccine and covid-19 to all the recommended vaccination groups that have not yet received the vaccine this season. Conflict of interest: participates in the preparation of the SiVIRA report.

Influenza Sorbet, as it was known during its 2004 debut, has a new and much more inviting name this time around.The Columbus-based premium ice-cream maker began selling its oldest newest flavor Monday by the scoop and by the pint at its 90 shops nationwide. Hot Toddy Sorbet is still based on the home remedy Jeni Britton’s grandmother used to make, with ingredients that include orange, lemon, honey and whiskey.An earlier iteration of the sorbet was made with Maker’s Mark bourbon, but its alcoholic kick now comes from Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey. Another punch comes from cayenne pepper: It tastes effervescent in the frozen sorbet, although its heat builds subtly.Hot Toddy Sorbet and the earlier Influenza Sorbet have made a few reappearances in the past 20 years — along with reminders that it won’t actually cure colds and flus. In 2013, HuffPost wrote that Influenza Sorbet had become “a sort of prescription du jour among foodies.” A year earlier, then-Columbus Health Commissioner Dr. Teresa Long said the frozen treat was no substitute for flu shots, washing hands and staying home when sick.Britton changed the name in 2013.

Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) may be at risk of bird flu as sea ice shrinks, bringing them in contact with infected birds more often. (Image credit: Craig Sellars / Getty Images)Polar bears could be catching bird flu after feasting on bird carcasses infected with the deadly strain H5N1. The infections could add additional and potentially devastating pressure on an Arctic population already under extreme stress from climate change, experts say. The first case of a polar bear (Ursus maritimus) dying from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was recently recorded in Alaska. Officials with the state's Division of Environmental Health confirmed the death in December after the carcass was found in the northernmost town of Utqiagvik in October. Experts believe the bear contracted the virus from infected birds it was scavenging on. It is likely other polar bears have been infected with bird flu, Robert Gerlach, Alaska's state veterinarian, told Live Science in an email. But how individuals respond to infection will depend on their overall health. The case was not unexpected — black bears (Ursus americanus) and brown bears (Ursus arctos) have previously been found with the deadly virus. However, polar bears are a vulnerable species because of the loss of their sea ice habitat, so any additional deaths from disease could serve another blow to the species. Related: 1st-known 'highly pathogenic' bird flu cases in Antarctic could threaten penguinsH5N1 was first identified in China in 1996, and since then outbreaks have been recorded across the planet. In 2020, a new variant emerged that caused an unprecedented number of deaths among birds. It spread to North America in 2021. Numerous mammals have also been impacted by the virus, leading to thousands of deaths worldwide.

A single death isn't necessarily relevant from a conservation perspective, Douglas A. Clark, associate professor at the University of Saskatchewan's School of Environment and Sustainability, told Live Science in an email. However, it shows the species is vulnerable. "This is unlikely to be an isolated event — it's just that this one led to an outcome that was detected," he said. Polar bears feeding on a whale carcass near Kaktovik, by the Beaufort Sea in Alaska. (Image credit: Gerhard Kraus/Getty Images)Monitoring for the virus among polar bears is difficult due to the landscape they live in. Experts said the risk of bear-to-bear transmission is low as polar bears are a solitary species, but the big concern for several subpopulations is that reduced sea ice has pushed them to feed more on seabirds, potentially leading to greater virus exposure. "The challenge is to determine if eating birds is increasing or if it's just that we're getting more reports of polar bears eating birds as there are more people in the Arctic and they're more likely to document such events," Andrew Derocher, a professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Canada's University of Alberta, told Live Science in an email. "Regardless, avian influenza is present in the Arctic and polar bears are likely to have been and will be exposed. How big a challenge it is [or] will be for the bears is hard to know."Pollution could also make polar bears more vulnerable to bird flu. The species is highly impacted by anthropogenic chemicals because they accumulate in the animals' high-fat diets. When the bears are forced to shore, their fat stores deplete and the circulating pollutants stored away in the fat start to interfere with their immune systems. "A bear fasting for longer, nutritionally stressed, may have a weakened immune system," Derocher said. "Now expose a bear with a weakened immune system to avian influenza and the issue of surviving the exposure becomes more challenging."RELATED STORIES—Move over polar bears, there's another top predator along the Arctic coast—Secret population of polar bears found living in seemingly impossible habitat—In 'extremely rare' attack, polar bear killed mother and child in Alaska. Now we know whyWhat happens next is unclear. Among polar bears, cases are likely to be limited to those scavenging or killing birds infected with the virus. Clark said disease hasn't really been a major issue in polar bear conservation so far, but this could change, and bird flu could become a "cumulative stressor" on a population already facing sea ice loss. "Decreasing the population of animals will mean fewer for breeding and raising the next generation," Gerlach said. "This on top of the stressors for access to habitat, food sources and impact of climate change could have some devastating effects."

With the chilly winter season now in full swing, flu and COVID-19 cases are trending upward in both Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.“There have been a few hospitalizations due to influenza virus. There have been hospitalizations due to RSV virus with little kids, obviously; and there have been some hospitalizations due to COVID,” said Dr. Henning Ansorg, Health Officer for the County of Santa Barbara.He says in recent weeks, influenza cases have risen primarily in the North County, while other local health officials say they have seen an increase in COVID-19 activity in Paso Robles and the City of San Luis Obispo.“I wear a mask when I am around people,” said Noah Castillo of Guadalupe.His brother, Matthew, adds that his school is also still taking measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.“They usually give us this little home COVID thing so you can do COVID tests at your house,” he said.Tara Kennon is the public information specialist for the San Luis Obispo County Health Agency and says that due to the increased use of home testing kits, her department can’t truly assess the exact number of COVID-19 or flu cases they are seeing.However, both she and Dr. Ansorg say their counties also monitor COVID activity in wastewater, which projects how case counts may look in the coming weeks.“What we have seen with COVID and with influenza is quite a significant uptick,” Dr. Ansorg told KSBY.He says while the estimated number of flu cases in Santa Barbara County mirrors what was seen this time last year, he adds that those figures are much higher than the year prior when people in the community were still masking up.He tells KSBY that over-the-counter medicine can be used to treat most influenza infections, but sensitive groups like young children and the elderly may want to consider another option.“When the virus gets identified early on, within 48 hours, there is a medication called Tamiflu to be taken that will really reduce influenza symptoms very significantly,” he said.Health officials in both counties say it is not too late for you to protect yourself against these viruses and are encouraging you to get vaccinated if you haven’t done so already.

The research may ultimately represent a significant advancement in the fight against seasonal flu, a notorious killer that claims over 36,000 lives annually in the United States alone.“In the last century, influenza A virus (IAV) has led to numerous pandemics, solidifying its enduring presence and burden to humans through continuous transmission. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the biology of IAV transmission and devise improved strategies to contain its spread,” wrote the study authors. Understanding the mechanismThe study was focused on the interaction between viruses and sialic acids (SAs), sugar molecules found on the surfaces of cells in the mammalian respiratory tract. The sialic acids act like locks to which viral particles – acting as keys – attach to initiate infections. The research team set out to inhibit this attachment process.Revolutionary findingsThe experts used a novel approach of desialylation, which involves stripping away SA receptors in the nasal cavities of infant mice using a neuraminidase enzyme. This process significantly impeded the transmission of influenza A from mouse to mouse. The enzyme reduced transmission rates dramatically, from 51% to 100% in various influenza strains tested.Ideal model for studying the flu Infant mice were chosen for this study due to their high concentration of sialic acids in the upper respiratory tract, mirroring the human respiratory system. This similarity makes infant mice an ideal model for studying flu transmission in children, who are known to be significant vectors in spreading the virus.Exciting potential Study lead author and infectious disease specialist Dr. Mila Ortigoza expressed optimism about the potential application of this method in humans. “If further experiments in humans prove successful, desialylating neuraminidase enzymes may prevent the flu from spreading,” said Dr. Ortigoza, who is also an assistant professor in the Departments of Medicine and Microbiology at NYU Langone.A proactive approachDr. Ortigoza emphasized the novelty of this strategy. It represents a shift from conventional methods, which mainly involve vaccines and symptom treatments, to a proactive approach in preventing the spread of infectious diseases by treating potential hosts.“While current approaches with vaccines and treatments target the virus, ours is the first study to demonstrate that treating the host, either infected mice or potentially infected humans, to prevent them from transmitting the virus to another host could be another effective strategy for combating pervasive infectious diseases.”Dr. Ortigoza noted that extensive clinical trials are necessary before this treatment can be approved for human use. The research team is planning further experiments to understand why infants are more susceptible to respiratory viruses and to explore if blocking sialic acids can prevent flu spread in children.The research is published in the American Society for Microbiology journal mBio.

Unfortunately, avian influenza (“bird flu”) is encroaching on the icy continent. The virus has already reached the sub-Antarctic islands between the Antarctic Peninsula and South America. It’s only a matter of time before it reaches the Antarctic continent. So far avian influenza has been detected in several seabird species on South Georgia Island and the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands. These birds are known to travel to Antarctica. Researchers also suspect avian influenza caused mass deaths of southern elephant seals. The arrival of avian influenza in Antarctica could have potentially catastrophic consequences for the wildlife, decimating large populations. Antarctic avian influenza outbreaks may also disrupt tourism and research activities during the busy summer season. So what can we do during this challenging time? The bird flu pandemic We are in the midst of a “panzootic” – a large-scale pandemic of avian influenza, which is occurring across the world and has affected more than 200 species of wild birds. While this strain of avian influenza (H5N1) is an old foe, the genetics and epidemiology of the virus have shifted. Once mostly found in poultry, it is now infecting large numbers of wild birds. Migrating birds have spread the virus with substantial outbreaks now occurring in Europe, Asia, Africa, North America and South America. Avian influenza has devastated seabird populations around the world, including a 70% reduction of northern gannets on Bass Rock in the United Kingdom. Many birds are diseased, with signs including loss of coordination, watery eyes, head twisting, breathing distress or lethargy. Beyond birds, this virus may have killed more than 30,000 South American sea lions and over 2,500 southern elephant seal pups in South America. In South Georgia mass deaths have been observed in elephant seal pups but the virus was not detected in samples sent for laboratory tests. Bird flu moving further south The first detection of avian influenza near Antarctica occurred in early October on Bird Island, South Georgia, in brown skuas (seabirds similar to large gulls). A case on the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands was confirmed a few weeks later in another seabird species, the southern fulmar. Genetic analysis revealed the virus entered these regions on two separate occasions. Skuas and kelp gulls were highlighted as species most likely to spread the virus to the Antarctic continent in a recent risk assessment, as they travel into the region from South America. They are also highly susceptible to avian influenza, with related species in the Northern Hemisphere suffering losses of more than 60%. What does this mean for Antarctica? The Antarctic Peninsula, with its ice-free areas, is an important breeding ground for many key Antarctic species. Critically, those species – and others, including the iconic Emperor penguin – live in dense colonies and are not found elsewhere in the world, making them particularly vulnerable to disease outbreaks. Outbreaks on the Antarctic Peninsula will also be extremely disruptive to the tourism industry. More than 104,000 people visited as tourists in the 2022–23 season. People visit to see wildlife, make a continental landing, and enjoy the scenery. Once avian influenza is confirmed at a particular location, sites will be closed to tourists. This will lead to a different experience for visitors, with land-based wildlife encounters pivoting to cruise-based activities. What are we doing? The Antarctic Wildlife Health Network of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research has developed recommendations for the research and tourism communities. These recommendations include information around biosecurity, testing and reporting of cases. The network’s database collates information on suspected and confirmed cases of the H5N1 avian influenza strain in the Antarctic region. This is central to rapid data sharing. During the 2022–23 season, a small number of researchers tested suspected cases and conducted surveys, which excluded the presence of avian influenza. This year, through the generosity of industry partners, we will dramatically expand this effort. The network will conduct surveys across the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic to monitor the presence and impact of the virus on wildlife. Safety and biosecurity measures have been boosted across the scientific community and tourism industry to reduce the risk of people spreading the virus. This should ensure essential scientific research and tourism activities can continue safely. New measures now in place include: disinfection of boots and outer clothing wearing of N95 masks, protective glasses and gloves when working with wildlife restrictions on access to infected sites. Tourism can play an important role in detecting and monitoring the spread of the virus, alerting authorities to new cases in locations not visited by scientists. The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators is on high alert. Extra training for field staff will help them identify wildlife illness quickly. Antarctica is connected Many threats to Antarctica – including climate change, pollution, and pathogens – originate elsewhere. Climate change is expected to increase the spread of infectious diseases in wildlife and Antarctica is not immune. Disease surveillance and information sharing between all those active in the far south are vital to help minimise the impacts of avian influenza and future disease threats. The avian influenza example highlights the connectivity of our world, and why we need to care for the planet at home in order to protect the far south.

A scientist tests a dead seal for avian influenza on South Georgia Island in December 2023. Dr. Marco Falchieri/APHA/Handout/Reuters CNN — An unprecedented and highly contagious bird flu outbreak in the sub-Antarctic has spread to mammals, British officials said Thursday, as experts warned the disease poses a significant threat to the region’s fragile ecosystem. It comes after the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in October confirmed the first case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in the Antarctic region in brown skua on Bird Island, South Georgia, a British overseas territory in the Southern Atlantic Ocean. In a news release Thursday, the United Kingdom’s Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) said the disease had now been detected in elephant and fur seals on South Georgia, which lies east of South America’s tip and just above Antarctica’s main landmass. “The presence of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) has today been confirmed for the first time in mammals in the sub-Antarctic,” it said. Bird flu is caused by infections that occur naturally among wild aquatic birds, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Infected birds can transmit the virus to other animals through their saliva and other bodily discharges. In its October statement, BAS said its analysis showed the virus had most likely been introduced to South Georgia through migratory bird movement from South America. In December, experts from APHA and BAS spent three weeks collecting samples from dead mammals and birds in the affected islands. These samples from elephant seals, fur seals, brown skuas, kelp gulls and Antarctic terns have tested positive for HPAI H5N1, APHA said. Fragile ecosystem at risk Antarctica and its offshore islands are home to more than 100 million breeding birds, six seal species and 17 species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises, according to global avian influenza experts network OFFLU, which has previously warned of the possibility of “efficient virus transmission” in the region. “Given Antarctica is such a unique and special biodiversity hotspot it is sad and concerning to see the disease spread to mammals in the region,” said Ian Brown, APHA’s director of scientific services.

European Union/Copernicus Sentinel-3/Handout/Reuters The world’s biggest iceberg is on the move “If avian influenza continues to spread throughout the sub-Antarctic region this could significantly threaten the fragile ecosystem, and potentially put a number of very large populations of seabirds and sea mammals at risk.” Samples collected from albatross and giant petrel colonies on Bird Island tested negative, APHA said. “There have been no reports of above average mortality in any penguin species to date,” it added. BAS, which operates two research stations on South Georgia, has out of caution suspended “most fieldwork involving contact with animals,” it said. Several countries experienced record outbreaks of bird flu least year. In Japan, nearly 10 million birds were killed to limit the spread of the disease, straining poultry supplies and sending the price of eggs soaring.

Early data from Canada suggests the flu vaccine is more than 60% effective this season, but CDC data suggests that less than half of people in the US have gotten it so far this season. Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service/Getty Images CNN — The United States started the new year awash in respiratory illness, with high levels of flu, Covid-19 and RSV across most of the country. The latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that some measures of flu activity dipped in early January, but the single week of decrease is not a trend – and experts warn that more increases are likely to come. “It’s actually pretty common that we see a little bit of a dip around the holidays, but we typically see an increase after that – because people will delay seeking care, and lots of people get exposed to different things through holiday travel,” said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. “I think we should definitely expect a lot more respiratory virus activity.” Young man washing hands - stock photo Solskin/Digital Vision/Getty Images Did you gather in large groups for the holidays? A virus may be your post-holiday present Respiratory virus activity was high or very high in all but 15 states during the week ending January 6, according to the CDC. In the latest update this week, and consistently through the season, the agency’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics has suggested that this respiratory disease season will probably result in a similar number of hospitalizations as last season. And while current hospital capacity is considered stable overall, the CDC says that hospitals in some parts of the country have reported strains on their resources due, in part, to increases in respiratory illness. “There’s still a substantial amount of respiratory virus season to go. These viruses, to one degree or another, will be with us through the end of this month and well into February,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. Last month, flu surpassed Covid-19 to become the leading respiratory virus driving emergency room visits. The CDC estimates that flu has caused at least 14 million illnesses, 150,000 hospitalizations and 9,400 deaths this season. Covid-19 hospitalizations have also been on the rise for weeks, more than doubling since the beginning of November. There were nearly 36,000 new Covid-19 hospitalizations during the week ending January 6, CDC data shows. Covid-19 infections are less likely to cause severe disease now than they were earlier in the pandemic, thanks to greater immune protection in the population from vaccination and prior infection. But wastewater surveillance suggests that viral activity is very high in the US, and experts caution that it’s not a time to get complacent. “We might be tired of it being respiratory virus season in the winter, but it shouldn’t surprise us. Just because you’ve experienced flu or Covid or RSV and been fine before doesn’t mean that’s what’s going to happen the next time,” Hamilton said. “We’re dealing with things that we feel more familiar and comfortable with, but being ready for yourself and your family is the most important thing that you can do.” There are still benefits to getting a flu shot this season if you haven’t already, the CDC says. It’s recommended as long as viruses are spreading, and there’s evidence that this year’s shot is particularly helpful.

Early data from Canada found the flu vaccine to offer strong protection this season, supporting earlier evidence from South America. Overall, the vaccine has been more than 60% effective against the prominent influenza A strain circulating in the US, and it’s been even more effective at protecting children under 10. Last season, overall effectiveness was less than 50%. Still, less than half of the US population has gotten the flu shot this season, according to the CDC. Only about 1 in 5 adults and fewer than 1 in 10 children have gotten the latest Covid-19 vaccine. “If you haven’t been vaccinated, yes, it’s very late, but it’s not too late. Don’t linger – get the vaccines this afternoon,” Schaffner said. “Get that mask out of your bureau drawer and put it on when you go to a basketball game or religious services, when you go to the supermarket and things such as that. Exert a bit of caution, because these are very contagious viruses.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

(Dreamstime, TNS - TNS/The Minnesota Star Tribune)CommentGiftShareListenThe federal government has paid Minnesota egg and poultry producers more than $135 million to offset losses caused by the worst avian influenza outbreak in U.S. history.The indemnity payments are meant to compensate for the birds that had to be culled after the virus was detected in flocks. Since 2022, Minnesota has lost 6.3 million birds, mostly commercial turkeys, to bird flu.The U.S. Department of Agriculture, created to protect the food supply and rural livelihoods, uses the indemnity program to essentially insure against calamity. USDA also pays for depopulation, disposal, contaminated materials and some other costs incurred as a result of outbreaks.Nationwide, the agency has paid poultry farmers and companies at least $660 million in bird flu indemnity payments since the outbreak began in 2022, according to a federal contracts database. More than 79 million birds have died.A full accounting of the economic impact from the ongoing bird flu outbreak is not yet available. The federal government spent nearly $1 billion nationally responding to the last large-scale outbreak in 2015, according to the USDA, which reported an additional $1.3 billion in lost export revenue.The virus, officially known as highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, does not pose a threat to food safety, health officials say.Ashley Kohls, executive director of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association, said farmers would much rather raise healthy birds than receive government checks. But current USDA policy dictates their approach to disease mitigation."Minnesota's turkey farmers do everything they can to protect their birds," Kohls said in an email. "As with any other instance in which the government takes or orders the destruction of an individual's property, the government reimburses the owner for the losses."Federal regulations require poultry operations to cull their flocks when avian influenza is detected. The indemnity payments are meant "to encourage prompt reporting of certain high-consequence livestock and poultry diseases and to incentivize private biosecurity investment, not to secure or protect producers from all consequences of disease," according to the USDA.More than 350 Minnesota farmers have relied on the indemnity program as they've faced catastrophic losses in their flocks. A majority of the relief — $79 million — was paid to Jennie-O Turkey Store producers across 19 Minnesota counties. Jennie-O, a subsidiary of Hormel Foods, is the second-largest turkey company in the country.Other Minnesota companies to receive more than $1 million in payments include turkey breeder Select Genetics; Howard Lake-based egg operation Forsman Farms; Sparboe, a Litchfield-based egg producer; and Michael Foods, a Hopkins-based egg processor and subsidiary of Post Holdings.Related CoverageBusinessBird flu cases slow in Minnesota, but egg producers elsewhere hit againAgricultureMinnesota turkey farmers say expanded rural broadband could help detect bird flu soonerThe payments don't include anticipated lost income or losses due to business interruptions and are based on the market value of the birds that had to be killed, according to the USDA. Michael Foods said it used payments to repopulate affected farms."Indemnity payments do not make farmers whole, rather it prevents them from going out of business during a foreign animal disease event," Kohls said.In May 2022, as bird deaths mounted, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the second-highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate agriculture committee, sent a letter with Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley calling on Congress to make funding the USDA avian health program a "high priority.""The outbreak of avian influenza was devastating to Minnesota's poultry growers," Klobuchar said in a statement Monday.Bird flu is typically spread by migratory waterfowl like geese and ducks that visit or leave droppings on poultry farms. Minnesota, the nation's leading turkey producer, is in a major migratory corridor.Iowa, a major egg producer, has also been hit hard by the outbreak and leads the nation in bird flu deaths with 18.8 million. Producers in the state have received at least $79 million in indemnity payments, according to federal data.Rembrandt Enterprises received more than $27 million in federal indemnity payments for bird flu losses at its egg facilities in Iowa.

What do you need to know? By Julie Appleby January 8, 2024 / 5:00 AM EST / KFF Health News CDC: ER visits for respiratory viruses spike ER visits for respiratory viruses skyrocketing, CDC says 04:00 It's winter, that cozy season that brings crackling fireplaces, indoor gatherings — and a wave of respiratory illness. Nearly four years since the pandemic emerged, people are growing weary of dealing with it, but the virus is not done with us.Nationally, a sharp uptick in emergency room visits and hospitalizations for COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, began in mid-December and appears to be gaining momentum.Here are a few things to know this time around: What's circulating now?The COVID virus is continually changing, and a recent version is rapidly climbing the charts. Even though it appeared only in September, the variant known as JN.1, a descendant of omicron, is rapidly spreading, representing between 39% to half of the cases, according to pre-holiday stats from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Lab data indicates that the updated vaccines, as well as existing COVID rapid tests and medical treatments, are effective with this latest iteration. More good news is that it "does not appear to pose additional risks to public health beyond that of other recent variants," according to the CDC. Even so, new COVID hospitalizations — 34,798 for the week that ended Dec. 30 — are trending upward, although rates are still substantially lower than last December's tally. It's early in the season, though. Levels of virus in wastewater — one indicator of how infections are spreading — are "very high," exceeding the levels seen this time last year. And don't forget, other nasty bugs are going around. More than 20,000 people were hospitalized for influenza the week ending Dec. 30, and the CDC reports that RSV remains elevated in many areas."The numbers so far are definitely going in the not-so-good direction," said Ziyad Al-Aly, the chief of the research and development service at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Healthcare System and a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis. "We're likely to see a big uptick in January now that everyone is back home from the holidays."But no big deal, right? Certainly, compared with the first COVID winter, things are better now. Far fewer people are dying or becoming seriously ill, with vaccines and prior infections providing some immunity and reducing severity of illness. Even compared with last winter, when omicron was surging, the situation is better. New hospitalizations, for example, are about one-third of what they were around the 2022 holidays. Weekly deaths dropped slightly the last week of December to 839 and are also substantially below levels from a year ago."The ratio of mild disease to serious clearly has changed," said William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. Even so, the definition of "mild" is broad, basically referring to anything short of being sick enough to be hospitalized. While some patients may have no more than the sniffles, others experiencing "mild" COVID can be "miserable for three to five days," Schaffner said.How will this affect my day-to-day life?"Am I going to be really sick? Do I have to mask up again?" It is important to know the basics.For starters, symptoms of the COVID variants currently circulating will likely be familiar — such as a runny nose, sore throat, cough, fatigue, fever, and muscle aches.So if you feel ill, stay home, said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "It can make a big difference."Dust off those at-home COVID test kits, check the extended expiration dates on the FDA website, and throw away the ones that have aged out. Tests can be bought at most pharmacies and, if you haven't ordered yours yet, free test kits are still available through a federal program at COVID.gov. Do COVID-19 tests still work after they expire? Here's how to tell.More free COVID-19 tests can be ordered now, as uptick loomsTest more than once, especially if your symptoms are mild. The at-home rapid tests may not detect COVID infection in the first couple of days, according to the FDA, which recommends using "multiple tests over a certain time period, such as two to three days." With all three viruses, those most at risk include the very young, older adults, pregnant people, and those with compromised immune systems or underlying diseases, including cancer or heart problems. But those without high-risk factors can also be adversely affected.While mask-wearing has dropped in most places, you may start to see more people wearing them in public spaces, including stores, public transit, or entertainment venues.Although a federal mask mandate is unlikely, health officials and hospitals in at least four states — California, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York — have again told staff and patients to don masks. Such requirements were loosened last year when the public health emergency officially ended. Such policies are advanced through county-level directives. The CDC data indicates that, nationally, about 46.7% of counties are seeing moderate to high hospital admission rates of COVID. "We are not going to see widespread mask mandates as our population will not find that acceptable," Schaffner noted. "That said, on an individual basis, mask-wearing is a very intelligent and reasonable thing to do as an additional layer of protection."The N95, KN95, and KF94 masks are the most protective. Cloth and paper are not as effective.And, finally, if you haven't yet been vaccinated with an updated COVID vaccine or gotten a flu shot, it's not too late. There are also new vaccines and monoclonal antibodies to protect against RSV recommended for certain populations, which include older adults, pregnant people, and young children. Generally, flu peaks in midwinter and runs into spring. COVID, while not technically seasonal, has higher rates in winter as people crowd together indoors. "If you haven't received vaccines," Schaffner said, "we urge you to get them and don't linger." Aren't we all going to get it? What about repeat infections?People who have dodged COVID entirely are in the minority. At the same time, repeat infections are common. Fifteen percent of respondents to a recent Yahoo News/YouGov poll said they'd had COVID two or three times. A Canadian survey released in December found 1 in 5 residents said they had gotten COVID more than once as of last June. Aside from the drag of being sick and missing work or school for days, debate continues over whether repeat infections pose smaller or larger risks of serious health effects. There are no definitive answers, although experts continue to study the issue.Two research efforts suggest repeat infections may increase a person's chances of developing serious illness or even long COVID — which is defined various ways but generally means having one or more effects lingering for a month or more following infection. The precise percentage of cases — and underlying factors — of long COVID and why people get it are among the many unanswered questions about the condition. However, there is a growing consensus among researchers that vaccination is protective. Over 6% of American adults are suffering from long COVID, survey finds 05:10 Still, the VA's Al-Aly said a study he co-authored that was published in November 2022 found that getting COVID more than once raises an "additional risk of problems in the acute phase, be it hospitalization or even dying," and makes a person two times as likely to experience long COVID symptoms. The Canadian survey also found a higher risk of long COVID among those who self-reported two or more infections. Both studies have their limitations: Most of the 6 million in the VA database were male and older, and the data studied came from the first two years of the pandemic, so some of it reflected illnesses from before vaccines became available. The Canadian survey, although more recent, relied on self-reporting of infections and conditions, which may not be accurate.Still, Al-Aly and other experts say taking preventive steps, such as getting vaccinated and wearing a mask in higher-risk situations, can hedge your bets."Even if in a prior infection you dodged the bullet of long COVID," Al-Aly said, "it doesn't' mean you will dodge the bullet every single time."KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

The latest results from samples taken from the islands reveal that the disease has now been detected in elephant and fur seals. Avian Influenza was first detected in the brown skua populations, closely followed by kelp gulls. The team at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), at Cambridge and on the islands, are working closely with the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) who govern the territory. Recent samples were collected by a vet from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and tested at their laboratories in Weybridge. The results are from samples collected from 14 different animals. They show positive results for HPAI H5N1 in elephant seals, fur seals, brown skuas, kelp gulls and Antarctic terns. Samples from the albatross and giant petrel colonies on Bird Island tested negative. There have been no reports of above average mortality in any penguin species to date. APHA scientist Dr Marco Falchieri visited South Georgia to take samples from elephant and fur seals. Sequence analysis from infected birds demonstrates that the virus has most likely been introduced through migratory bird movement from South America. Further analysis is ongoing to determine the source of infection for the seal species. BAS and GSGSSI, guided by the GSGSSI response plan, continue to carefully monitor the situation across the territory. BAS operates two research stations on South Georgia: King Edward Point and Bird Island. As a result of the confirmed cases of HPAI, most fieldwork involving contact with animals has been suspended. BAS staff are following the additional biosecurity measures adopted this season of enhanced cleaning of clothing and field equipment when moving between sites with high densities of wildlife, as well as remaining vigilant for signs of disease. Ash Bennison is the science manager for Bird Island Research Station. He says: “It’s incredibly sad to witness the effects of avian flu on the animal populations we study on South Georgia. We are doing everything we can to mitigate the effects of this disease and are working closely with GSGSSI to continue our work to monitor and conserve these amazing species.” Key elements of the wider science programme at King Edward Point and Bird Island continue under caution, including long-term monitoring of wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, grey-headed albatross, northern and southern giant petrels, gentoo penguins and macaroni penguins. South Georgia has some of the most closely monitored seabird colonies in the world, equipping scientists and conservationists with indicators of change for species. Bird Island is an important site for albatross colonies. Wandering albatross_Richard Phillips, BAS BAS and GSGSSI are working closely with APHA to monitor and control the spread of the disease and to mitigate its impact on the region’s wildlife. Laura Sinclair Willis, Chief Executive, Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands, says: “The Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands anticipated that High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza would likely arrive on our shores in the 23/24 austral summer, and we are grateful for the ongoing support of the Animal and Plant Health Agency, British Antarctic Survey, Ministry of Defence and the Antarctic cruise industry, along with a global community of partners and stakeholders who are helping us to monitor the impacts within the Territory. “The transmission and spread of this disease is primarily a natural phenomenon, and we continue to emphasise the importance of scrupulous biosecurity by all those entering South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.” Latest results show avian flu is affecting the fur seals on South Georgia. Credit_BAS Professor Ian Brown, APHA’s Director of Scientific Services, said: “Given Antarctica is such a unique and special biodiversity hotspot it is sad and concerning to see the disease spread to mammals in the region. If avian influenza continues to spread throughout the sub-Antarctic region this could significantly threaten the fragile ecosystem, and potentially put a number of very large populations of seabirds and sea mammals at risk. “However, the available genomic surveillance data continues to suggest no widespread mammalian adaptation of the virus and the knowledge gathered from these latest samples will be shared rapidly with international partners to aid their efforts to tackle the disease and inform global risk mitigation. Uncertainties remain as to how the virus is infecting and spreading amongst these populations. APHA will continue to work with the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, the Falkland Islands and the British Antarctic Survey to monitor the impact of the wildlife on South Georgia, and the potential spread to other areas.” APHA Weybridge provides impartial, high quality scientific expertise and policy development. Work on animal diseases has been conducted at the APHA Weybridge site for over 100 years and the International Reference Laboratory for influenza and Newcastle disease holds one of the largest viral repositories globally, with our oldest isolates dating back to 1940s.

Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said Influenza A is the most prominent respiratory virus in circulation at this time. (Janella Hamilton/CBC)Social SharingHealth officials say influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are both on the rise in B.C., while the rate of COVID-19 continues to decline. Speaking at her first public briefing of the new year on Wednesday, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said it's common to see a spike in illness from respiratory viruses soon after the holiday season."We will continue to see high rates of influenza and RSV for the next few weeks. I expect if it follows the pattern that we've seen before that we may have a peak in the next week or so," said Henry. "COVID-19 activity, on the other hand, remains stable and has been decreasing since early November."At the same time, hospitals in the province are treating a record number of patients, according to Health Minister Adrian Dix.He told Wednesday's briefing that 10,435 people were in hospital as of Tuesday night, describing it as a "time of challenge" for the heath-care system — but adding that hospitals could "absolutely" handle the surge.WATCH | Not too late to get the flu shot, says top doctor, as influenza peaks in B.C.: B.C.'s top doctor says influenza peaking in province — and it's not too late to get flu shot10 months agoDuration 2:22Dr. Bonnie Henry says influenza A is the most prominent respiratory infection circulating in January.Dix attributed the record, in part, to the return of the "full slates of surgeries" since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.But Henry also said emergency departments have been particularly busy with young people."While we're not seeing as much respiratory illnesses ... as in other parts of Canada and the world where immunization rates are lower, it is a reminder of the importance of vaccinations and healthy habits in limiting the impact on ourselves, our families, our communities and our health-care system," she said.Dr. Bonnie Henry says that B.C.'s high rate of vaccination has helped as respiratory illnesses surge, but urged anyone without a flu shot to get one if they can. (LookerStudio/Shutterstock)Last week, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control said a third child under the age of 10 had died with flu being a contributing factor but not necessarily the primary cause of death. Henry said none of the three had been vaccinated against influenza and all developed a secondary bacterial infection."I think this is really important. It is so sad and tragic when we know that young people can be protected from these infections. We know that any respiratory virus can cause an inflammation in the lungs that makes you more susceptible to having bacterial infections," she said.3rd child dies of flu-related causes in B.C. as cases continue to riseHealth Minister Adrian Dix said B.C. hospitals have capacity to deal with a surge if more people get sick in the coming weeks."Absolutely we do," he said. "That doesn't mean it isn't challenging, it is very challenging. The prevalence of illness in society is reflected in the health-care community as well ... There's hundreds of thousands of health-care workers in B.C. province but 18,000 of them missed about one day in [the past week] because of illness."According to Dix, B.C. has the highest rate of flu and COVID-19 vaccination in North America.'They're all back': B.C. medical experts warn of seasonal illness 'tridemic'As of Jan. 9, 1.519 million doses of flu vaccine have been administered so far this flu season, and 1.39 million doses of COVID-19 booster vaccines.Henry said a recent survey shows that 83 per cent of people in the Lower Mainland have some level of immunity against COVID-19, either through infection or vaccination. That's an increase of 10 per cent from the same time last year.She said studies show that hybrid immunity gained by those who have been both vaccinated and infected with COVID-19 is resulting in better health outcomes. "This hybrid immunity gives more durable and longer lasting protection, particularly against severe outcomes," she said."I think we're seeing some of that reflected in the levels of hospitalization [due to COVID-19] that are lower now than they have been in the past."ABOUT THE AUTHORKarin Larsen@CBCLarsenKarin Larsen is a former Olympian and award winning sports broadcaster who covers news and sports for CBC Vancouver.With files from The Canadian Press and Janella HamiltonCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Top stories from British Columbia B.C.

Most health insurance plans cover the cost of a flu shot if you visit an in-network provider. You can typically find free flu shots without insurance at your job or school. Other places that might offer free flu shots include local pharmacies, grocery stores, health departments, churches and synagogues, and community centers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone aged 6 months and older (with just a few exceptions) get a flu shot before the end of October of each year. Flu season typically begins in October and peaks from December to February. Read on to learn where to get free flu shots without insurance and how long they last. SDI Productions / Getty Images How Much Does a Flu Vaccine Cost? The flu shot is free if you have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA). These plans will not charge you a copayment or coinsurance if you visit an in-network healthcare provider, even if you have not met your yearly deductible. These guidelines also apply to people with most private health insurance plans. The out-of-pocket cost of a flu shot without insurance usually depends on where you go and what kind of vaccine you get. Some pharmacies, such as CVS and Walgreens, give you a coupon for a discount on a purchase at the store when you get a flu shot. The cost of a standard flu shot at some popular pharmacies is: CVS Walgreens $62.99 $58.99 Vaccines made specifically for people aged 65 and over are more expensive than others. Medicare Part B fully covers senior vaccines. Where Can You Get a Free or Low-Cost Flu Shot? There are several ways to get free or low-cost flu shots if you do not have health insurance. You can check with places where you are enrolled in some kind of loyalty program to see if you might be eligible for a discount. Walgreens, for example, gives 20% off the retail price of flu shots to those enrolled in their Prescription Savings Club. Other places offer drive-through flu shots, including community clinics, major hospital networks, and even grocery chains. To help you out, Health rounded up all the places where you can get a free flu shot with or without insurance. Many places welcome walk-ins, but it's smart to go online or call first to see if you need an appointment. Urgent Care Centers Check with local urgent care centers if you have work or personal commitments and are unable to make it to a healthcare provider. Many urgent care centers are open after hours and on weekends. Some may offer low-cost flu shots if you do not have health insurance. For example, PhysicianOne Urgent Care offers a standard flu shot for $25 out of pocket. Just make sure to call your local urgent care center ahead of time to make sure the shots are available at an affordable cost. Your Job Many companies offer free flu shots on-site, often without health insurance. Some companies provide vouchers that you can take to local pharmacies. Check with human resources if you have not heard anything about those offers from your employer. Getting the COVID-19 Vaccine: What To Expect Before, During, and After Your Appointment Your University Head to your campus health center, where you can often score a free flu shot if you are still in school. College students are particularly more likely to skip out on getting yearly flu shots than others. A 2017 Harris Poll conducted on behalf of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, for example, found that fewer than half of college students regularly get the vaccine. Supermarkets Many large grocery store chains, including Stop & Shop, Kroger, and Safeway, have on-site pharmacies offering free flu shots with most health insurance plans. Even stores without pharmacies may sponsor pop-up flu shot clinics. You might be able to get a low-cost flu shot at one of these chains if you are uninsured. For example, Costco offers a standard flu shot starting at $19.99 if you are a member. Local Health Departments, Community Centers, or Religious Sites Many county health departments offer free flu shots during flu season, with or without health insurance. Contact your county's health department to see if you can benefit from the service. You may be able to get the flu shot for no cost through local churches and synagogues, free clinics, and community centers if you do not have health insurance. How Long Does the Flu Shot Last? Immunity from the flu shot lasts about six to eight months. You will need a new flu shot yearly to protect you during flu season. The vaccine also changes from year to year. Scientists predict what strains of the virus will be dominant during flu season and update the vaccine accordingly. You can technically still get the flu shot well into flu season (like if you forgot about it until January). Still, getting the vaccine right away is still wise. For most people, getting a flu shot takes less than one minute and can be totally free. A Quick Review The flu shot is key to protecting you and others against the seasonal flu virus. Whether you have health insurance or not, the vaccine is likely available at no or low cost through a healthcare provider, urgent care center, job, school, pharmacy, or grocery store, among other places.

By FERN's Ag Insider FERN's Ag Insider The Food & Environment Reporting Network (FERN) is the first independent, non-profit news organization that produces in-depth and investigative journalism in the critically under-reported areas of food, agriculture, and environmental health. Through partnerships with local and national mainstream media outlets, FERN seeks to tell stories that will inspire, inform, and have lasting impact. Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on January 9, 2024 Close Photo: Getty Images Since bird flu outbreaks began nearly two years ago, the USDA has spent slightly more than $1 billion to compensate farmers for lost flocks and to suppress the spread of the viral disease, said a spokesperson for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service on Monday. The largest outlay was $715 million to producers, growers, and integrators in indemnities for depopulated birds and eggs. An additional $183 million was spent to kill and dispose of flocks and for virus elimination work. “Current associated personnel, contractors, state agreements, and field costs are estimated at an additional $130 million,” said the spokesperson. The largest recipient of indemnities, at $74.8 million, was Jennie-O Turkey Store, a subsidiary of Hormel Foods, said California veterinarian Crystal Heath, who obtained a list of USDA payments through a public records request. The other top recipients were Rembrandt Enterprises, of Iowa, $27.9 million; Sunrise Farms, of Iowa, $25.8 million; MG Waldbaum, of Minnesota, $25.2 million; and Tyson Foods, of Arkansas, $24.3 million, she said. The ongoing outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza are the largest animal disease event in the nation’s history. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

Duke researchers developing longer-lasting flu vaccineAnnual flu shots require some guesswork by public health experts. A universal shot being developed by Duke University researchers could offer more protection -- and fewer jabs in the arm.Posted 2024-01-11T15:00:12+00:00 - Updated 2024-01-11T22:28:58+00:00Fewer shots, less illness: The promise of a 'universal' flu shotBy Grace Hayba , WRAL health reporterOne shot a year that targets the anticipated dominant strain of influenza. That’s the status quo for those looking to survive flu season.But what if you could get one shot every few years that targeted all of the flu strains at once?That’s the goal of Duke University scientists who are working on a universal flu vaccine.“What we’ve done is just simply ask the question: Is it possible to make an antibody that would bind to all sorts of flus, not just the flu of the season,” said Garnett Kelsoe, an immunology professor at Duke University School of Medicine.Kelsoe’s team, along with a group of researchers at Harvard University, have been working on the development of a universal flu vaccine for seven years.Recently, the team discovered a group of antibodies in several unrelated humans that target all types of influenza. The antibodies were also found in some animals.“It was quite rare actually,” Kelsoe said. “It was two antibodies out of about 8,000 that bound to all sorts of different kinds of flu — the flu that is circulating now, but also flu that has circulated in the past and kinds of flus that actually are only in animals.”The discovery, published late last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could mean unprecedented protection against a virus that infects millions and kills thousands of people each year.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the flu caused an estimated 31 million people to get sick and 21,000 deaths during the 2022-23 flu season. And on Wednesday, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services released data indicating that deaths related to the flu are on the rise in the state.Annual flu shots require some guesswork by public health experts who predict the prevailing flu strain. A universal shot, the thinking goes, could offer more protection and possibly reduce the severity of the illness, and perhaps reduce deaths.“The way that all human vaccines are developed right now is they’re developed for the strain that the World Health Organization basically bets is going to be the circulating strain the next year, so it’s always bet in advance. Sometimes they’re right, sometimes they’re not right,” said Kelsoe.To get the vaccines manufactured and into pharmacies on-time, the prediction has to be made several months in advance which leads to an average annual flu vaccine efficiency of about 50%.A universal flu vaccine is designed to be more of a “sure bet” by defending against a wider array of flu strains — not just those predicted by public health experts, Kelsoe said.After the researchers discovered the antibodies, the team at Harvard used what’s called cyro electron microscopy to determine where the antibody attaches to the flu virus.The researchers at Duke then introduced the antibodies to mice and injected them with the flu.“You can give the mice hugely lethal doses of influenza virus, and the mice survive,” Kelsoe said. “In fact, they don’t really get sick at all.”The recent rise in North Carolina flu deaths comes as the CDC says flu vaccinations are the lowest in the last five years.If people could get just one shot that protected against all strains rather than just one, it could greatly combat vaccine hesitancy, Kelsoe says.“If a shot is really good and it lasts for multiple years, you have great faith in that it’s terrific,” he said. “If you have to get a shot every year and it’s only about 50% effective, that reduces people’s faith. One of the goals of the universal vaccine is to regain people’s faith and the efficacy of vaccines.”The team will now move forward with their findings to test in primates sometime over the next two years. If the vaccine proves to be effective in primates, then human trials could begin.Kelsoe said it’s still important for people to get their annual flu shot while the universal vaccine is being developed.“Even the vaccines that are not 100% effective reduce sickness and significantly reduce death. They’re very, very valuable.”More On This watch · 2:50Fewer shots, less illness: The promise of a 'universal' flu shotnull MINS AGO Respiratory viruses across the state continue to drop for fifth consecutive week, PICU capacity still highnull MINS AGOrelatedWRAL specialistsvaccinationfluhealthWRAL TechWireTrending Duke rises to No. 6, UNC falls to No. 10 in AP Top 25 poll South Carolina a unanimous No. 1 in women's AP Top 25, Stanford and Oregon crack rankings Woman drives around barricades on I-40, dies near NC-Tennessee line No. 9 NC State falls in Final Four rematch vs. No. 1 South Carolina Late comeback falls short, No. 11 Duke loses at No. 18 Maryland 85-80Videos watch · 2:07WRAL WeatherCenter Forecast16 MINS AGO watch · 1:21Daytime Pick 3 and Pick 4 Drawing watch · 1:05:14President Biden and VP Harris participate in Veterans Day wreath laying ceremony watch · 1:27Evening Pick 3 Pick 4 and Cash 5 watch · 0:41Mega Millions Drawing•CreditsJessica PatrickWeb EditorGrace HaybaReporterCopyright 2024 by Capitol Broadcasting Company.

From: Animal and Plant Health Agency Published 11 January 2024 Dr Marco Falchieri of the Influenza and Avian Virology team sampling a seal The presence of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) has today (Thursday 11 January) been confirmed for the first time in mammals in the sub-Antarctic. The disease was detected in elephant and fur seals on the island of South Georgia by experts from the UK’s world-leading Animal Plant Health Agency (APHA). Working alongside the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) and the British Antarctic survey (BAS), APHA has been at the forefront of testing for bird flu in mammals in this sub-Antarctic region since it was first suspected last year. South Georgia is a UK Overseas Territory situated in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, approximately 1,000km south-east of the Falkland Islands, and is accessible only by ship. It has some of the most closely monitored seabird colonies in the world, equipping scientists and conservationists with indicators of change for species. HPAI was first suspected on Bird Island off the northwest coast of South Georgia in October 2023 after the deaths of several brown skua. Sequence analysis from infected birds demonstrates that the virus has most likely been introduced through migratory bird movement from South America. Leading APHA scientist Dr Marco Falchieri of the Influenza and Avian Virology team spent three weeks in the sub Antarctic region visiting the affected islands onboard Royal Navy vessel HMS Forth and collected samples from dead mammals, including elephant seals, and birds. Following testing and sequencing at APHA’s laboratory in Weybridge, the samples have tested positive for HPAI H5N1 in elephant seals, fur seals, brown skuas, kelp gulls and Antarctic terns. Samples were also collected from albatross and giant petrel colonies on Bird Island but tested negative. There have been no reports of above average mortality in any penguin species to date. The available genomic surveillance data continues to suggest no widespread mammalian adaptation of the virus. There remains no increased risk to human health - the risk of human infection with H5N1 remains very low. Professor Ian Brown, APHA’s Director of Scientific Services, said: Given Antarctica is such a unique and special biodiversity hotspot it is sad and concerning to see the disease spread to mammals in the region. If avian influenza continues to spread throughout the sub-Antarctic region this could significantly threaten the fragile ecosystem, and potentially put a number of very large populations of seabirds and sea mammals at risk. However, the available genomic surveillance data continues to suggest no widespread mammalian adaptation of the virus and the knowledge gathered from these latest samples will be shared rapidly with international partners to aid their efforts to tackle the disease and inform global risk mitigation. Uncertainties remain as to how the virus is infecting and spreading amongst these populations. APHA will continue to work with the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, the Falkland Islands and the British Antarctic Survey to monitor the impact of the wildlife on South Georgia, and the potential spread to other areas. BAS operates two research stations on South Georgia: King Edward Point and Bird Island. As a result of the confirmed cases of HPAI, most fieldwork involving contact with animals has been suspended. BAS staff are following the additional biosecurity measures adopted this season of enhanced cleaning of clothing and field equipment when moving between sites with high densities of wildlife, as well as remaining vigilant for signs of disease. Key elements of the wider science programme at King Edward Point and Bird Island continue under caution, including long-term monitoring of wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, grey-headed albatross, northern and southern giant petrels, gentoo penguins and macaroni penguins. Ash Bennison, science manager for Bird Island Research Station, said: It’s incredibly sad to witness the effects of avian flu on the animal populations we study on South Georgia. We are doing everything we can to mitigate the effects of this disease and are working closely with the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and the Animal and Plant Health Agency to continue our work to monitor and conserve these amazing species. Laura Sinclair Willis, Chief Executive, Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands, said: The Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands anticipated that High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza would likely arrive on our shores in the 23/24 austral summer, and we are grateful for the ongoing support of the Animal and Plant Health Agency, British Antarctic Survey, Ministry of Defence and the Antarctic cruise industry, along with a global community of partners and stakeholders who are helping us to monitor the impacts within the Territory. The transmission and spread of this disease is primarily a natural phenomenon, and we continue to emphasise the importance of scrupulous biosecurity by all those entering South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. This work follows the announcement of an additional £3.3 million from UK Research and Innovation’s (UKRI) Tackling Infections programme and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) granted to our FluMap project. The new project, FluTrailMap, will respond to the evolving nature of avian influenza and further our understanding of: transmission and infection in different bird populations, including how the virus transmits from wild birds to farmed poultry the gaps in biosecurity that allow the virus to penetrate premises, and how they may be addressed the role of immunity in wild birds in the evolution of the virus how the implementation of vaccination might impact upon outbreaks The Animal and Plant Health Agency is a world leader in studying avian influenza. Our International Reference Laboratory at Weybridge conducts analysis on global samples, provides expert advice and rapidly shares the latest information internationally on outbreaks. APHA Weybridge is globally recognised in providing impartial, high quality scientific expertise and policy development.

The state veterinarian’s office announced in December that a polar bear (Ursus maritimus) had died from the H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Biologists believe the bear, found in the North Slope town of Utqiagvik in October, contracted the virus from scavenging on infected birds. State veterinarian Bob Gerlach suspects other cases among polar bears have not been detected. “You’re really dependent on the public that’s out there, or the wildlife biologists that are doing surveillance,” he told the Alaska Beacon. The virus has claimed red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), black bears (U. americanus) and brown bears (U. arctos), in addition to wild birds—particularly waterfowl—and domestic poultry in the state since it was first discovered there in April 2022.

So it’s going to help protect you from getting the flu, but more importantly, it will protect you from getting really, really bad flu, like that gets you in the hospital or on a breathing machine.”Dr. Esper said it’s also very important for people who are 65 and older, children under five, pregnant women, and those with pre-existing health conditions to get vaccinated, since they are considered more vulnerable.Latest Daily Health StoriesHow Our Immune System Protects Against VirusesWhen to Take a 'Time Out' While Watching SportsTips for Reversing PrediabetesWhy the Gloomy Weather Makes Some SadTips for Combating 'Decision Fatigue'Do you Have Electsomnia?Halloween 101: Trick-or-Treating Safety TipsHow to Feed your SkeletonRendered: Tue Nov 12 2024 04:15:19 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)FacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramLinkedInPinterestCleveland ClinicHomeAbout Cleveland ClinicCareers at Cleveland ClinicGivingOffice of Diversity & InclusionCommunity OutreachResearch & InnovationsHealth LibraryFree Health eNewslettersResources for Medical ProfessionalsMedia RelationsSite Information & PoliciesSend Us FeedbackAbout this WebsiteAdvertising PolicySocial Media PolicyCopyright, Reprints & LicensingWebsite Terms of UseWebsite Privacy PolicyNotice of Privacy PracticesNon-Discrimination NoticeResourcesBuildingsFacts & FiguresPress ContactsStudio & Live Shot Locations9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 800.223.2273 | © 2024 Cleveland Clinic.

This is the only choice farmers have to battle highly contagious bird flu, said Bill Mattos, president of California Poultry Federation.When birds are euthanized it is expected to take six months before production can resume. The news is likely to boost both chicken and eggs prices in California this year.Until recently, California poultry farms were largely immune from the impacts of the avian influenza virus, which severely impacted farms in states such as Iowa, America’s largest egg producer. But recent outbreaks at commercial poultry farms in Merced and Sonoma counties have stoked fears of a worsening spread in the Golden State, says the California Farm Bureau.According to the California Department of Food and Agriculture, five California counties — Fresno, Marin, Merced, San Joaquin and Sonoma — now have active avian flu infections. Fresno and Merced counties are the top chicken production counties in the state. Stanislaus and Fresno counties are the top producers of turkey.Kings County has egg ranches and meat producers like Foster Farms and Pitman Family Farms who are and have been expanding operations.Pitman Farms is planning to expand an existing chicken farm near Lemoore and seeks a conditional use permit to allow for the expansion from 65,000 chickens. It also wants to add 16 new poultry barns and would include an additional 485,000 chickens, for a new total of approximately 550,000 chickens. The project includes the construction of 432,000 square feet of new poultry barns. A public hearing at the planning commission is set for February.The Sanger company also permitted an expansion in 2022 of a second Kings County farm near Stratford that would allow up to 1.7 million birds.With huge investments like this, farmers have to be concerned that their work could be wiped out, at least temporarily.Nearby, Central Valley Eggs is one of the largest cage-free egg production and processing facilities in the country, located on 160-acres just across the Kern County border.Since the H5N1 virus first surfaced in the U.S. in 2022, nearly 80 million birds across the nation have been destroyed, driving up prices of eggs, chicken and turkeys as production plummeted.The bird flu has no impact on humans.Until last fall, the disease appeared to have left California poultry farms relatively unscathed compared to farms in states such as Iowa.Iowa, the nation’s largest egg producer, has seen nearly 19 million birds wiped out since 2022 due to bird flu. The first year of the outbreak, California bird losses totaled 751,680. The number jumped to more than 4.7 million in 2023, with most of the cases occurring since October, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.“This year, it’s just a different story, and we’re very concerned about it,” said Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation.Commercial poultry farms in Merced and Sonoma counties, which did not record any cases in 2022, have been hit particularly hard this time, with more than 3.78 million birds destroyed so far between the two regions.“We’re still trying to put out a wildfire here,” said Scott Weber, an owner of Petaluma-based Sunrise Farms. The Sonoma County egg producer has been grappling with impacts of the virus since late November, having been forced to euthanize all its birds.Weber said the farm has tried to keep all employees working during the cleanup process, which he expects will continue for months. But with production at a standstill, he acknowledged the farm may need to lay off some of its workforce, even though “we’re trying our best not to do that.”He said it remains unclear how the farm contracted the virus, noting “we’ve done everything we can” to keep it out.Avian influenza is introduced primarily by wild birds such as waterfowl and shorebirds, which can carry the virus but not appear sick. Infected birds shed the virus into the environment through their feces and secretions. Domestic poultry can catch AI directly from infected birds or indirectly through contaminated water, feed, clothing and equipment.Besides domestic birds, avian influenza is spreading this winter among the state's abundant migratory bird population.Supply of eggs is down 12% this week in California, says USDA. Not surprisingly, egg prices have already increased by nearly 12% in January from December of 2023.California Farm Bureau contributed to this story.

Pierce | Jan. 9, 2024, 6:06 p.m. | Updated: 8:30 p.m.Two children have died of the flu in the past 30 days in Salt Lake County. That’s in addition to three people over the age of 50 who have also died, according to the Salt Lake County Health Department.None of the people who died had any record of receiving an annual flu shot this season, officials noted.“These deaths are a tragic reminder that influenza is a serious disease,” said Angela Dunn, executive director of the county health department. “Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu shot every year to prevent serious illness and death, and to avoid getting others sick.”The county released no further information about the five people who died, citing medical privacy laws.Since Oct. 1, more than 350 people have been hospitalized locally with the flu. Most were over the age of 50, officials said. The second-biggest group hospitalized was children under the age of 4.In Utah, flu season can begin as early as October and continue into May. Cases commonly peak in January or February.An ‘unusual’ flu season(Chris Samuels | The Salt Lake Tribune) Dr. Angela Dunn, executive director of the Salt Lake County Health Department, speaks during a news conference on Monday, May 23, 2022. Since Oct. 1, 2023, more than 350 people have been hospitalized with the flu in Salt Lake County.The current flu season is considered “slightly unusual,” because there are three strains actively circulating, said epidemiologist Ryan Chatelain, with the county health department. “Typically, we see one strain responsible for most cases through the season’s peak, and a few early or late cases due to other strains.”The three strains currently circulating are Influenza A (H1N1); Influenza A (H3N2); and Influenza B (Victoria), according to the county health department.All three are included in the 2023–24 flu season vaccine. The vaccine helps prevent illness, and during breakthrough cases, it can help lessen the severity and duration of illness.“This year’s seasonal flu vaccine is well-matched to the virus strains we’re seeing in circulation,” Dunn said in a statement. “Vaccination is the best defense against being hospitalized or dying from the flu.”People are also encouraged to wash their hands regularly and stay home from work or school if sick to help stop the spread of infection.How to get vaccinatedThe county health department advised that RSV and COVID are also causing serious illness right now.Vaccines are available for both. The county health department encourages people to get vaccinated for flu, RSV and COVID — “not only to protect themselves, but also to protect loved ones who may be more susceptible to serious complications from a respiratory illness.”Flu and COVID vaccines are available at pharmacies, doctors’ offices, and Salt Lake County immunization clinics. Call 385-468-7468 (SHOT) to make an appointment.The RSV vaccine — which is only available to people over 60, under 8 months, or people who are pregnant — is also available at pharmacies and health care providers.“Getting vaccinated is easy,” Dunn said, “and it saves lives.”RELATED STORIESUtah’s flu activity is ‘rapidly’ increasing, data shows, as COVID-19 and RSV also continue to riseIn case you missed itUtah AD Mark Harlan says BYU game was ‘absolutely stolen from us’Utah holiday pop-up markets have you covered for unusual and locally made giftsPREMIUMBronwyn Newport, the newest member of SLC’s ‘Real Housewives,’ says ‘I’m learning a lot about myself’THE LATESTUtah Hockey Club has a new roster member.

News ‘Tripledemic:’ Influenza, RSV, COVID-19 spikes in Utah by: Anneka Johns Posted: Jan 9, 2024 / 07:26 PM MST Updated: Jan 9, 2024 / 07:26 PM MST by: Anneka Johns Posted: Jan 9, 2024 / 07:26 PM MST Updated: Jan 9, 2024 / 07:26 PM MST SHARE SALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — A spike of three respiratory illnesses is covering much of the Beehive State. Per Gestland, a Primary Children’s pediatric doctor, said right now, Utah is experiencing a “tripledemic,” or three overlapping epidemics — RSV, influenza and COVID-19. Health officials confirm 5 flu-related Utah deaths this season, including 2 children A triple-threat of viruses can have dire consequences if not treated. “Lots of coughing and lots of fevers, lots of muscle aches, some trouble breathing, needing oxygen … and often in the case of RSV, that lands in the hospital,” Gestland said. While these viruses are normal for this time of year, Gestland said Utah is experiencing higher numbers than usual. According to Gestland, this is because during the COVID-19 pandemic, people wore masks and social distanced. During this time, “RSV and flu basically just disappeared,” he said. When people backed off from those precautions, he said “[the viruses] came back with a vengeance.” That vengeance is hitting many Utahns — making what some believe to be a common cold something far worse. “People that have runny noses and coughs progressed to lower respiratory tract infections, often in the case of these three viruses,” Gestland said. One good thing about each of these illnesses, Gestland said, is that there are immunizations available — and not only are they available, but he said they are the best bet at getting better “The flu is oftentimes more than just the flu, and it can be a pretty severe illness. And it makes a lot of sense to get informed and to get immunized and protect yourself and your family from it if you can,” he said. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

A California Department of Food and Agriculture technician performs tests on chickens for bird flu at the Best Live Poultry & Fish store in Sylmar. (Damian Dovarganes / Associated Press) By Salvador HernandezStaff Writer Jan. 9, 2024 4 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URLCopied! Print December should have been the most profitable month of the year for Liberty Ducks, a poultry farm in Sonoma County. Instead, the 31-year-old business was suddenly face to face with a possible shutdown.“There was never going to be a good time for this to hit, but during the holidays was especially hard,” said Jennifer Reichardt of Liberty Ducks. The farm, she said, has been “crippled” by the outbreak.In December, the farm was one of nine locations in Sonoma County infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as bird flu. As a result, poultry farmers in the county have been forced to destroy more than 1 million birds while trying to quarantine their flocks to curb the outbreak. Advertisement The outbreak has been ongoing since 2022, but its sudden surge in December has meant restaurants in the winery-rich region are seeing their supplies of poultry dwindle. Experts warn this may only be the beginning of a bird flu spike in California. “Restaurants are looking for product,” said Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation. The lingering disease has yet to affect prices or supply across the state as a whole, Mattos said, given the poultry available from other counties and outside the state. But restaurants, stores and wholesalers who prefer to use local sources are seeing their supply dwindle. Advertisement “Everyone is looking to see what they can do to prevent it even more,” Mattos said. Liberty Ducks supplies Bay Area restaurants and more than 200 wholesalers. But because the company’s locations are under quarantine, the farm can’t start new production, Reichardt said.“Our business will be at a standstill for at least two months until the quarantine is lifted or we find other locations,” she said. Poultry companies have been feeling the effects of the avian flu since February 2022, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture first detected the virus in commercial and backyard flocks. Advertisement Since then, more than 79 million birds across the U.S have been affected in 47 states. In California, the virus has affected 37 commercial and 22 backyard flocks, totaling 5.4 million birds, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Since the outbreak began, the avian pandemic has not gone unnoticed by consumers either. Last year, the outbreak helped make egg prices skyrocket across the country. According to the USDA, prices in California for a dozen large eggs jumped to $7.37 in January 2023, up from $2.35 the year before. The USDA said that while demand for eggs was surging in December 2022, the avian flu was cutting the supply; in the last week of that month, there were about 29% fewer eggs than at the beginning of 2022.A higher incidence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza is common during this time of year because of the migratory patterns of wild birds, which carry the virus as they fly from the Arctic to California, said Dr. Maurice Pitesky, associate professor at UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, whose research focuses on the disease.Unfortunately, the same climate and geography that makes poultry farming popular in some areas is what draws in wild birds like ducks and geese, carrying the flu with them into the state. The virus can pass from one animal to another through saliva, mucus or feces.“Wildlife can bring this virus into their farms because the virus is so infectious,” Pitesky said. Farmers have tried to keep their flocks safe through biosecurity practices, such as requiring clean footwear before workers enter a farm to keep feces from contaminating the area under the shoes, Mattos said. Several big farms also try to reduce risk by prohibiting their workers from owning backyard flocks. Advertisement This past month, however, poultry farmers in Northern California have been particularly affected by the virus. “I’m not sure if it’s a more virulent strain or what,” Mattos said. “The industry expects it to come and show up, we just didn’t expect it to be in big numbers.”According to the USDA, 11 flocks in California have tested positive for the virus in the past 30 days, affecting more than 3.3 million birds.In Sonoma County, the effect has been significant. Poultry at nine sites in southern Sonoma County have been infected with the virus, requiring more than a million birds to be euthanized to prevent further spread, according to the county. On Dec. 5, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors declared a local emergency because of the disease. Flocks that have been infected have been put in quarantine, and county officials are hoping to curb the spread of the virus. The flu’s effect in the county and region is still unclear, but officials are concerned that the consequences could ripple through affected farms, workers, restaurants and markets that rely on the farms’ eggs, meat and jobs. Advertisement A spokesperson for Sonoma County said officials have not yet done an economic impact study, but are focusing resources on containing the outbreak. According to the California Department of Food and Agriculture, five California counties — Fresno, Marin, Merced, San Joaquin and Sonoma — have active avian flu infections. The flu could be especially damaging to businesses like Liberty Ducks that are still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.“After COVID, we were already in such a tight financial space, this really could have been the final blow,” said Reichardt. She and her brother set up a GoFundMe campaign to keep the business afloat, and have raised more than $184,000 so far. “The community outreach is not only letting us continue on and help with cash flow, but also mentally gives us such a lift to fight on,” Reichardt said. Advertisement Some farms can also apply for federal compensation for the value of lost birds, but Mattos said it is not enough to cover what farmers could have made from their flocks. For now, farmers and backyard flock owners are being urged to take precautions and keep their birds isolated from exposure. And depending on this year’s rains, poultry farmers may be seeing just the first effects of the outbreak this year, Pitesky warned. “If it’s a wet year, unfortunately, [wild birds] will probably stay here until April and May,” he said. “Most likely, they’ll be dealing with this for several more months.” More to Read Invasive fruit fly species puts parts of Orange County under quarantine Nov. 6, 2024 Bird flu virus found in Los Angeles County wastewater Nov. 1, 2024 A concerning development: H5N1 bird flu has infected a pig in Oregon, officials say Oct. 30, 2024 CaliforniaAnimals & Pets Newsletter Sign up for Essential California The most important California stories and recommendations in your inbox every morning.

The Greeks "who lost their lives lately were almost entirely unvaccinated," said Health Minister Adonis Georgiadis on Wednesday during a press conference in Athens.Out of 1,028 deaths linked to Covid-19 reported since September across the country, only two were vaccinated, and out of 90 patients currently hospitalised in intensive care units only two are vaccinated, according to data presented by Ministry officials. Advt The health system in Greece was still not under significant pressure from hospitalisations. Therefore, the Ministry opted to stay with a strong suggestion for the use of protective facemasks mainly in hospitals and not proceed to an announcement of mandatory use of masks or other measures, like the ones introduced recently in other European countries, officials said.In a country of nearly 10 million people, only 210,000 have received the latest dose of the vaccine against Covid-19 since autumn, and 2.9 million citizens have been vaccinated so far against the flu down from 3.4 million last year, Xinhua news agency reported.Greece records since November a gradual rise in Covid-19 cases, unseen since the summer of 2022, and a further increase was expected in the coming days, according to Ministry experts, due to contamination during the Christmas and New Year's holidays gatherings.--IANSint/khz IANS Published On Jan 11, 2024 at 06:36 AM IST Telegram Facebook Copy Link Be the first one to comment.

This ensemble of organs, which contains the mouth, nose, throat, and lungs, lets us breathe and talk, manages our body temperature, brings oxygen to other organs, and removes waste carbon dioxide. A plethora of diseases can target the respiratory system, disrupting our health in ways that limit those essential functions. Be on the watch for these respiratory illnesses that may have a significant impact on your health.1. InfluenzaKnown commonly as the “flu”, influenza makes its return each winter as cases spike. Certain flu statistics are difficult to discern because the illness is not always reported, but the World Health Organization estimates 290,000 to 650,000 flu-related deaths around the world annually. What Are the Symptoms of Influenza?The flu has symptomatic similarity to other respiratory infections, causing sore throat, coughing, fever, body aches, tiredness, and headaches. How Dangerous Is Influenza?The combination of different influenza strains has created notable health emergencies throughout the past century. The Spanish flu pandemic from 1918 to 1920 killed around 50 million people globally. The most recent influenza pandemic, the 2009 Swine flu (or H1N1 flu), killed more than 280,000 people globally. Another influenza pandemic is possible in the future, but fortunately, we appear to be more prepared than ever to identify potential viral flashpoints and combat respiratory illness.Read More: What's the Difference Between Influenza and Stomach Flu?2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary DiseaseChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most widespread respiratory conditions. It impacts 16 million Americans, and millions more are undiagnosed.What Are the Two Types of COPD?COPD consists of a group of diseases that block airflow to the lungs and cause other breathing-related problems. There are two main types of COPD: Emphysema — when the air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) are damaged — and chronic bronchitis — when airways are constantly inflamed and become inundated with mucus. Most people with COPD will experience both conditions. What Are the Risk Factors for COPD?Exposure to tobacco smoke and other pollutants increases the risk of getting COPD. Those who have occupations that deal with dust, vapors, and fumes — frequent in mining, construction, and transportation industries — are most likely to suffer from COPD. How to Treat COPDCOPD progressively worsens over time, but those who are diagnosed can turn to several treatments that should improve their quality of life. For those with a history of tobacco use, quitting smoking hinders the progression of COPD. Medicines, therapies, and surgeries further alleviate any problems caused by the disease.What Is the Life Expectency of COPD?Life expectancy for people with COPD depends on a variety of factors. Mild cases will see people living into their 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s, but additional complications could result in earlier death. The BODE index — measuring body mass index (BMI), airway obstruction, dyspnea (shortness of breath), and exercise tolerance — helps to predict COPD life expectancy.Read More: Why Are Viruses More Active In The Winter?3. Asthma Like COPD, asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that requires ongoing medical treatment. It results in inflammation and swelling of the airways, making them narrower and limiting the movement of air to the lungs.How Prevalent Is Asthma?Asthma affects more than 27 million — or every 1 in 12 — people in the U.S. It is a predominant chronic disease among children, with 4.5 million children under the age of 18 suffering from it. According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, 10 people in the U.S., on average, die from asthma daily.What Happens During an Asthma Attack?When an asthma attack occurs, the muscles in the airways tighten in an event known as a bronchospasm. Asthma attacks, which can be caused by exposure to allergens or a pre-existing illness, may last for only a few minutes, or for a longer period. Mild cases can be resolved with a fast-acting inhaler, which instantly delivers medication that relaxes airway muscles and reduces inflammation. If coughing or shortness of breath continues for days, however, medical treatment should be sought. Read More: Coughs of Many Colors: How to Get Rid of Phlegm4. Pneumonia Pneumonia hits one or both lungs with an infection that can be deadly for people in high-risk groups. When someone contracts pneumonia, the alveoli of their lungs fill up with fluid, pus or blood. There are more than 30 causes of pneumonia that stem from bacteria, viruses, and fungi. A common bacterial version of the infection is pneumococcal pneumonia, caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is particularly dangerous for adults with chronic health conditions such as COPD, asthma, diabetes, and heart disease. What Are the Symptoms of Bacterial Pneumonia?Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia include coughing that produces mucus, fever, heavy sweating, chills, and breathing difficulties. Antibiotics are used to facilitate recovery, and other simple treatments such as resting and increasing fluid intake help speed up the healing process.What Are the Symptoms of Viral Pneumonia?Pneumonia caused by viruses make up one-third of all pneumonia cases. Viral pneumonia shares many of the same early-stage symptoms as the bacterial infection, but it may eventually cause headaches, muscle pain, and weakness. This type of pneumonia is often mild and gets better within 1 to 2 weeks with symptomatic management, without the need for antibiotics. Comparing Bacterial Pneumonia vs. Viral PneumoniaViral pneumonia is more likely if someone exhibits lower temperature, problems in both lungs, and a lack of obvious symptoms at first. Bacterial pneumonia, deadlier than its viral counterpart, is usually associated with higher temperature, and problems with only one lung, and acute onset.Every year, about 1 million adults in the U.S. are admitted to hospitals with pneumonia, and about 50,000 of them die from the disease.Read More: Chicken Noodle Soup Really Can Help When You're Sick5. TuberculosisTuberculosis — a persistent respiratory menace throughout the ages — has gone by numerous recognizable names: TB, consumption, or ‘the white death.’ From the 18th to the early 20th centuries, it flourished among populations and generated widespread concern. Mortality rates from the disease have since fallen with the inception of a vaccination and improved public health measures, but it remains an eminent danger in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Western Pacific. What Causes Tuberculosis?Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria, is spread through the air. Many people who are infected, however, do not show symptoms and cannot spread the disease: this is considered latent tuberculosis. What Are the Symptoms of Tuberculosis?About 5 to 10 percent of infected people will start to show symptoms and develop TB disease. Once it advances to this point, symptoms include prolonged cough with blood-tinged sputum, chest pain, weakness, fatigue, night sweats, and fever. The main treatment for TB is antibiotics; The treatment period can take anywhere from 4 to 9 months. How Prevalent Is Tuberculosis?An estimated 10.6 million people contracted the disease worldwide, and 1.3 million people died as a result, making TB the second leading infectious killer after COVID-19. In contrast to these staggering numbers, there have been only a few hundred TB deaths in the U.S. every year since the early 2000s.Read More: What Is the Drug Bedaquiline and Why Is It Important for Those With Tuberculosis?6. COVID-19Although the havoc that ensued from the COVID-19 pandemic has simmered down, thousands of people continue to die from this respiratory illness. What Causes COVID?Caused by a virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this well-known disease imposes a wide array of symptoms that range from mild to severe. What Are the Symptoms of COVID?People with COVID experience a typical fever, cough, and fatigue, but other effects can arise from more severe cases. COVID-19 is set apart from other respiratory illnesses by a few unusual symptoms that impact bodily functions and persist for months, also known as Long COVID. These include digestive problems, loss of taste/smell, and skin changes. Some people with COVID experience sudden loss of memory and general confusion; It turns out that COVID doesn't just attack the lungs, but also has a chance to develop inflammation of the brain, or encephalitis. How Dangerous Is COVID?Nearly 7 million deaths have been attributed to COVID-19, with about 1 million of them in the U.S. Although 71 percent of the global population has been vaccinated, the arrival of new strains keeps COVID a real concern.Read More: Does a Runny Nose Mean You Have COVID-19, the Flu, or a Common Cold?human bodyinfectious diseases1 free article leftWant More?

The clear message we have is that for influenza (and COVID), vaccination can make a difference.“It’s not that COVID is not worrisome, but our big problem is influenza,” Dubé added. “And you can be vaccinated for both. There are people (at the vaccination centres) who are there expecting you.”Nearly 250 Quebecers a day are being hospitalized for the flu, COVID and other respiratory infections, placing the province’s health-care system under enormous pressure. In the last 14 days, the province has reported a daily average of 10,057 ER visits, up by 10 per cent from the corresponding period last year.Most of that increase is being driven by patients suffering from the flu and upper respiratory infections, with more than 1,900 Quebecers a day showing up in ERs who have such symptoms. That is up from just over 1,000 ER visits daily for the flu and other respiratory infections at this time last year.“The numbers are moving up and it’s challenging for the physicians and the emergency-room teams,” said Dr. Luc Boileau, Quebec’s chief public health officer.Today's One ReadGet the most interesting story of the day.There was an error, please provide a valid email address.Sign UpBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.Thanks for signing up!A welcome email is on its way.

He added that people develop flu antibodies within days of their shots.At present, only 60 per cent of Quebecers over the age of 70 have been vaccinated against the flu. The dominant flu strain responsible for this year’s wave is Type A (H1N1), although Type B is also circulating — both of which are covered by vaccines.Although Dubé appeared to downplay the impact of COVID on the province, the government’s own figures reveal that the pandemic illness is responsible for at least 50 ER hospitalizations each day, and that number is climbing. This trend is coinciding with a COVID uptick in the United States that is being fuelled by the JN.1 sub-variant, which is also predominant in Quebec.Meanwhile, at least 1,000 patients who need to be hospitalized are instead languishing on stretchers in ER corridors, sometimes for days, acknowledged Dr. Gilbert Boucher, president of the Association des spécialistes en médecine d’urgence.Advertisement 4Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentBoucher noted that ERs are particularly overcrowded in the Greater Montreal region. But he expressed some optimism as many hospital workers are returning to work after the holidays, and their assistance should ease pressure on the health network.He said what’s different this year from last year is that the previous flu season peaked in late November 2022.Recommended from Editorial $543,000 salary for Santé Québec 'top gun' CEO draws ire of unions Analysis: 'Pandemic is far from over,' expert says as new variant spurs major COVID resurgence One million Quebecers infected with respiratory viruses Dubé, Boileau and Boucher last held a news conference on Quebec’s ER crisis on Dec. 19, during which the health minister appeared to blame part of the overcrowding on “a large percentage of people who consult at the emergency department who don’t have an urgent problem.”That comment drew a sharp rebuke from the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the CAEP said he was “concerned” by Dubé’s comments, adding that if patients feel they need emergency health care, they shouldn’t hesitate to go to the ER.“We’re sorry if that message wasn’t clear,” Boucher said Wednesday, adding that if people have truly urgent concerns about their health, they should not hesitate to go to the ER. However, he pointed out that ERs in Ottawa and Vancouver are not nearly as overcrowded as those in Quebec.aderfel@postmedia.comtwitter.com/Aaron_DerfelAdvertisement 5Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentArticle contentShare this article in your social network Share this Story : Quebec hit with major flu wave as emergency room visits jump by 10 per cent Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr CommentsYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.Create an AccountSign in Join the Conversation Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

Though most cases are mild, some patients have been admitted. H1N1 has symptoms similar to seasonal flu and can lead to complications like pneumonia. Hospitals have established dedicated flu corners to provide specialized care for swine flu patients. Representational image (IANS) NEW DELHI: A surge in influenza cases compounded by H1N1, or influenza A, and other respiratory illnesses have been reported across hospitals in the city. Though most of the cases are mild, many patients have been admitted in hospitals, according to doctors.According to doctors, H1N1, also called swine flu, has symptoms similar to seasonal flu, such as fever, cough, sore throat, bodyache, fatigue and headache.Like Covid-19, severe instances of H1N1 may result in complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.âSix patients are currently undergoing treatment for H1N1,â said Dr Akshay Budhraja, senior consultant & head of sleep and respiratory medicine, Aakash Healthcare Super Specialty Hospital, Dwarka. He added that to contain the spread of H1N1, hospital authorities had established dedicated flu corners within the medical facility to provide specialised care for individuals affected by swine flu.Though no H1N1 case was reported at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, three patients were admitted with Covid. âOf them, two are on oxygen support and one is in the ICU. Besides, three patients with severe acute respiratory infection have also been admitted,â said Dr Ajay Shukla, director and medical superintendent of the hospital.In clinical terms, there isnât much to differentiate between these illnesses as all are a result of respiratory viruses and they present as cough, cold and, in some cases, shortness of breath, according to Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max Healthcare. He added that in most of these cases, patients had a mild ailment limited to the upper respiratory tract and were managed in the outpatient department.The main concern is about patients with comorbidities who may need admission for severe infection. Dr Manjeeta Nath Das, senior consultant, internal medicine, Narayana Hospital, Gurgaon, said, âWhile young patients recover within a week, the elderly with severe inflection spiked by comorbidities take more time. Their recovery depends on symptomatic treatment.â In the past three days, of the 15 patients presenting with flu-like symptoms, four tested positive for H1N1 and one for Covid, Das added.According to doctors at Kalawati Saran Childrenâs Hospital, around five youngsters have been diagnosed with H1N1 this month. The hospital administration has created an eight-bedded isolation ward to deal with such cases.âSince we are not testing everyone, there is no individual data but most of the cases are mild and they recover in 3-5 days,â assured Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine, Max Superspecialty Hospital, Saket. âItâs a mix of H1N1, Covid and other viruses. Some create complications like pneumonia, for which they need admission for monitoring and for intravenous medication.âTo curb the spread of H1N1, early detection, swift diagnosis and appropriate management are important, says Dr Avi Kumar, senior consultant, pulmonology, Fortis Escorts. âIt is imperative for individuals to be attuned to flu-like symptoms, seek prompt medical attention and adhere to preventive guidelines,â Kumar advised, adding that his hospital had admitted six patients, four of them cases attributed to H1N1 and two to Covid.Dr Manisha Arora admitted these were challenging times, with the escalating influx of flu cases, mainly H1N1, coupled with super-added bacterial infections, especially among the elderly. The senior consultant and head of internal medicine at Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute said, âIn recent days, our OPD has been managing nearly 12-15 flu cases daily, with one-third requiring admission with confirmed H1NI infection.âTo accurately diagnose H1N1, managing director of Aakash Healthcare Dr Aashish Chaudhry emphasised the necessity of RT-PCR testing. As a preventive measure, he also recommended prophylactic antiviral treatment for at-risk individuals, such as family members of patients. Such an approach aims to curb the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable individuals from severe outcomes.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous10 ingredients used for making healthy dumplingsFood10 steps to start the most beautiful rose garden at homeLifestyleTop 10 must-try jungle safaris in IndiatravelWorld Rhino Day: 10 things to know about rhino conservation efforts in IndiatravelHow to make the perfect Masala Omelette at homeFoodWorld Tourism Day: 10 most peaceful countries in the worldtravel8 natural sources of Vitamin B12Lifestyle8 things that make us happy from withinLifestyleHow to make Palak Patta ChaatFoodâ10 jaw-dropping animals with incredible bite strengthâLifestyle Next123Hot PicksWho is Marcellus WilliamsNandini Ghee Tirupati LadduAkshay Shinde EncounterKrishna Janmabhoomi Case LiveTirumala laddus rowEric Kilburn JrBridgerton Themed BallTOP TRENDINGJohn Cena Expensive CarsJason Kelce Wife Net WorthKangana RanautMuda ScamMarcellus WilliamsBadlapur School Sexual Assault CaseVande BharatMost Stressed States in the USDanny AmendolaDonald TrumpTrending StoriesIn CityEntire Website'Nandini': The new ghee supplier for Tirupati laddus â who owns it?Indiaâs rising influence in the Asia Power Index surpassing Japan and China; ranks 3rd in the list3 Reasons Why Bad Blood 2024 Will Make An Epic Return To WWE PLE Calendar'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viralEY Pune employee Anna Sebastian's death: Probe finds MNC lacked labour welfare permitVirat Kohli, Gautam Gambhir, Rishabh Pant's buggy-ride goes viral; fans say 'teeno bhai tabahi' - Watch'Virat Kohli has lost momentum, can't beat Sachin Tendulkar's record'Pope offers refuge to jailed Suu Kyi: ReportYouTuber Sugandha Sharma apologises after video defaming Bengaluru sparks outrageGoldberg vs Brock Lesnar: Who Won The Greatest Battle In WWE History?'Why was he shot in head?': Key questions by Bombay HC in Badlapur encounter case'Anti-diabetes pill ...': Check CDSCO's list of drugs that do not meet standards'I was molested in ambulance in which my husband was fighting for life'Several flights diverted at Mumbai airport amid heavy rain'Why hasn't BJP expelled her?': Cong seeks action against KanganaKohli's spin vulnerability exposed again as Axar cleans him up in netsWhat the rest of India can learn from Tamil Nadu's footwear clustersFlipkart claims 3 users got iPhone 13 at Rs 11: What company saidTirupati laddu row: Reddy calls for atonement rituals on Sept 28 for Naidu's 'sin'Haryana assembly election: Why 'unhappy' Kumari Selja could play the spoilsport for CongressAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorMX PlayerHindi PodcastPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth+ TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosTechnology NewsHot on the WebAsha BhosleTirupati Laddoo ControversyAishwarya RaiDaily HabitsGovinda Makeup Man DeathViraj GhelaniLaapataa LadiesAlia BhattParis Fashion Week 2024Optical illusionTop TrendsScott Steiner WifeVirat KohliElon MuskCaleb WilliamsBrad HoggSean CombsRic FlairVince McMahon DocuseriesKerala Lottery ResultsDonald Trump Iran ThreatRishabh PantRG Kar HospitalPaedophile CoachBadlapur Encounter CaseOdisha Army officer assault caseVande Bharat SleeperLive Cricket ScoreTrending TopicsLaapataa LadiesBigg Boss Tamil 8Esha DeolJungle SafariChia SeedRose GardenWorld Rhino DaySharp Eye TestMasala OmeletteMpoxDevaraStree 2 CollectionPrakash RajHealthy RaitasSwatantrya Veer SavarkarColdplay India tour 2025Coin Master Free SpinsBrad PittAmazon SaleWordle AnswerLiving and entertainmentETimesTravel DestinationsCricbuzz.comTVLifestyleNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgetsCareersColombiaLatest NewsStrike by more than 1,000 Samsung workers enters a third weekIndia chess federation announces Rs 3.2 crore rewards for Olympiad-winning teams8 Spices that can help reduce high blood sugar'Imprints of Make in India visible everywhere': PM Modi lauds 10 years of flagship initiativeWho is Laurene Powell Jobs?

New York City is one of a handful of hot spots for respiratory illnesses this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. All of the hotspots had either high or very high concentrations of COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus or influenza — aka “the tripledemic.” Symptoms of a regular cold tend to spike within the first few days of a person being sick, although certain symptoms, such as a runny nose or consistent cough, can last up to 14 days, according to the CDC. However, symptoms of influenza, RSV, the coronavirus and other viruses typically last seven days — but could continue for as long as two weeks. 4 Symptoms of a regular cold tend to spike within the first few days of a person being sick. Subbotina Anna – stock.adobe.com People who have pre-existing conditions such as asthma may experience symptoms for a long time, leaving some curious as to when their cough means they should schedule an appointment at the doctor’s office. See Also Respiratory illnesses are surging in NYC and nationwide, CDC warns — here are the states with the highest rates Dr. Lena Wen told CNN that those who have suffered through symptoms for longer than two weeks without feeling any better should see a medical professional. People experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain and an inability to retain fluids should check in with a doctor as soon as possible. In addition, those at the extremes of ages — newborns and elderly individuals — and those with underlying medical conditions are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms and should seek medical care sooner than the average individual. Indeed, hospitalization rates are the highest among young children and senior citizens. Wen also warned that a viral infection could develop into a bacterial infection if untreated. 4 However, symptoms of influenza, RSV, the coronavirus and other viruses typically last seven days (but could continue for as long as two weeks). Getty Images 4 Dr. Lena Wen told CNN that those who have suffered through symptoms for longer than two weeks without feeling any better should see a medical professional. Afshar Tetyana – stock.adobe.com She also noted that the symptoms could be a sign of another condition, which medical attention would help suss out. Although there are several general markers to indicate when someone should see a doctor, Wen encourages everyone to stay attuned to their bodies and seek medical help when they feel they should. See Also What to know about the RSV vaccine — before a ‘tripledemic’ strikes “The preventive things are all the same — you know, stay home if you’re sick, wash your hands, cough into your sleeve, don’t rub your eyes, nose and mouth, get up to date on the vaccinations,” Dr. Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services in Texas, told ABC News. In addition to a new COVID-19 booster shot that’s arriving in pharmacies and doctors’ offices now, there are also two FDA-approved vaccines for RSV available for adults, one of which is also approved for pregnant women to shield their newborns from RSV. However, the urgency that led to higher vaccination rates, and the public outreach efforts that occurred in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, have largely faded, giving way to complacency and “COVID fatigue” — even as people continue to die from the disease. 4 Medical experts recommend staying home, washing your hands and staying up to date on your shots. Getty Images/iStockphoto As such, experts are still sounding the alarm. On Thursday, Wisconsin health officials urged pregnant women to get the new vaccine to protect newborns from RSV. The virus has thus far killed three children and killed nearly 600 babies there this season, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

The Alaska population of the bear is already classified as threatened, and experts believe that the new source of mortality could make the species' survival more difficult.The infected polar bear died sometime in the fall, and the cause of death was confirmed to have been the avian flu on Dec. 6, according to Alaska's Division of Environmental Health. Prior to that, the viral strain had killed a few red foxes, one black bear and one brown bear in Alaska, according to a June 2023 report from the state."This is the first polar bear case reported, for anywhere," state veterinarian Dr. Robert Gerlach told the Alaska Beacon, saying that it was likely the bear had eaten a dead bird when it contracted the virus. The bear's body was found in the North Slope, where state data shows more than a dozen animals have tested positive since the outbreak began in 2022. Polar bears, the largest living bear species, are considered threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The animals primarily feed on seals, but global warming has contributed to a loss of sea ice in the Arctic that seals rely on. Research has shown that the condition of some seal species has declined because of it.Right now, it's not clear just how much polar bears are relying on birds as a food source, or how many polar bears could be infected. But Douglas Clark, an associate environmental professor at the University of Saskatchewan, told CBS News that it's "absolutely typical" for polar bears to feast on birds, both alive and dead, and that reliance on this food source "appears to be increasing in multiple portions of the Arctic as it warms." "Earlier sea ice breakup puts the bears onshore earlier in the season (on average) and increases their overlap with nesting birds," he said. "That means the risk of avian influenza infection for polar bears is probably also going up over time."Clark told CBS News that disease "has never been considered a conservation concern for polar bears," making this case, "a novel situation.""This is unlikely to be an isolated event," he told Live Science. "It's just that this one led to an outcome that was detected."For now, Clark told CBS News, "nobody knows" what kind of impact this will have for the polar bears of the Arctic. "There are 19 populations of polar bears around the Arctic, and they all face different environmental conditions, overlapping with different bird populations too, so their exposure to avian flu is likely to vary," he said. "The impact will probably vary too because those populations are all experiencing climate warming at different rates and in different ways, and dealing with two big challenges is tougher than just one."Gerlach told Live Science that if more polar bears end up impacted by the virus, it could spell trouble for maintaining their population."Decreasing the population of animals will mean fewer for breeding and raising the next generation," he said. "This on top of the stressors for access to habitat, food sources and impact of climate change could have some devastating effects."And treating the flu among polar bears isn't really an option. Currently, it's "extremely difficult and costly" to diagnose and treat polar bears infected by the avian flu, Clark said."This particular avian flu outbreak is of global scope," Clark told CBS News. "It has affected many species of birds and mammals worldwide: that scope is unprecedented. Each of those interactions with a new host species creates novel conditions for the virus, and in 2020 we all learned what that can mean."The most recent avian flu outbreak has caused trouble worldwide. In its most recent situation report, published in October, the World Organization for Animal Health said that more than half a million poultry birds died or were culled globally in the most recent three-week period leading up to the report. In Argentina, 300 southern elephant seals died because of the virus."The virus has been increasingly detected in mammals in recent months, a situation that should be monitored," the group said. "... Experts highlighted that the negative impact of HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) on Antarctic wild birds and mammal populations could be immense. ... It is very worrying to see that the disease has progressed in this direction over the last few weeks."

On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its latest flu data for the week ending on January 6. Outpatient visits for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) were down that week, the first decline after weeks of rapid increases. Flu test positivity and hospitalizations were also down slightly.

Credit: CDC But transmission is still elevated around the country. Fourteen states have ILI activity at the "very high" level in the current data, down from 22 the week before. And 23 states have "high" activity level, up from 19 the week before. (You can see the week-by-week progression of this year's flu season in the US here.) The CDC says it is monitoring for "a second period of increased influenza activity that often occurs after the winter holidays." Map of ILI activity by state. Credit: CDC Map of ILI activity by state. Credit: CDC Flu isn't the only virus that seems to be letting up a little in the data, at least for now. COVID-19 data also showed some dips, with the CDC reporting that "despite test positivity (percentage of tests conducted that were positive), emergency department visits, and hospitalizations remaining elevated nationally, the rates have stabilized, or in some instances decreased, after multiple weeks of continual increase." The CDC speculates that some of the declines in indicators could be due to people not seeking medical care during the holidays as they would otherwise. COVID-19 wastewater activity levels remain "very high," with all regions showing high or increasing levels. The South and Midwest have the highest levels in the latest data, but there are some early indications that rises in the Midwest and Northeast may be slowing down. Meanwhile, RSV activity remains elevated, though some areas are starting to see declines. The CDC notes that it's not too late to get vaccinated against COVID-19, flu, and (for those ages 60 and over) RSV. So far, 21 percent of adults have received the 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccine, including 41.5 percent of people ages 65 and up. Around 363,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the US since September. For flu, about 47 percent of adults have received their annual shot, including 74 percent of people ages 65 and up. On Thursday, researchers in Canada published the first estimates of flu vaccine effectiveness this season, finding the current annual shots are 61 percent effective against the most common strain of flu circulating in the US (influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) and 49 percent effective against the less common influenza A(H3N2) and 75 percent effective against influenza B. The CDC estimates that there have been at least 14 million flu cases, 150,000 hospitalizations, and 9,400 deaths from flu so far this season, the agency reported. In the first week of this year, 13 children died of flu, bringing this season's total to 40.

Experts working with the Australian Antarctic Program have travelled to Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic this summer to monitor wildlife for signs of the H5N1 strain of the disease.It's only a suspected case for now, but the discovery in the past week of a single bird with potential avian influenza could mark the realisation of scientists' worst fears.For months, the highly contagious and deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has been tearing a path of devastation across South America.Now there are concerns the disease may have finally reached the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, on the western side of the continent."The impact will potentially be catastrophic," Michelle Wille, a senior research fellow at the Centre for Pathogen Genomics at the University of Melbourne, said.A suspected case of avian influenza has been identified on the Antarctic Peninsula. (ABC News: Magie Khameneh)The suspected case, which is listed on the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network's database, involves a gull-like bird known as a brown skua.It was observed by researchers on an outcrop called Heroina Island.Bird flu alertPhoto shows A group of emperor penguins and their chicks standing on a snowy landscape in Antarctica.A deadly strain of bird flu that has already killed millions of seabirds across the world is likely to land on Antarctic shores this summer, threatening already struggling penguin colonies and marine mammals.Getting confirmation of the case is difficult, as samples cannot always be collected in remote locations.And even if they are, it can take many days, if not weeks, to analyse them at laboratories thousands of kilometres away.If the latest suspected case is avian influenza, it would be the closest the disease has been to Antarctica, after previously being detected as near as the Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.Preventing its further spread across the frozen continent — including the vast section in the east claimed by Australia — is near impossible."In South America, the virus travelled the entire 6,000-kilometre spine in about six months," Dr Wille said."So this virus has the capacity to move vast distances, fast."We can only hope that it does not reach the Australian Antarctic Territory this austral summer."If it does, it will likely do so with a trail of destruction."Michelle Wille says avian influenza can move vast distances, fast. (Supplied: Michelle Wille)Elephant seal pups suffer 70 per cent mortality rateA study released late last month reaffirmed the devastating impact of the disease.The report, published in Marine Mammal Science, analysed data from an outbreak among southern elephant seals at Peninsula Valdez in Argentina in early October.About 70 per cent of the 1,891 seal pups born along a 13-kilometre stretch of coastline during the peak breeding season died.During the same period a year earlier, the mortality rate was less than 1 per cent.By extrapolating the results across the region's entire colony, researchers estimate around 17,400 seal pups succumbed to the deadly disease.Avian influenza is devastating southern elephant seal populations in South America. (AAD: Karl Rollings)Where thousands of weaned pups would normally be expected in late October and early November, only 58 were seen.The researchers also observed dozens of adult seal carcasses in an area where seeing dead adults is a rare event. Other seals displayed symptoms including head tremors, lack of coordination, and nasal discharges.But it is not just southern elephant seals that have been affected by avian influenza.A network of avian influenza experts, known as OFFLU, has reported the deaths of more than half-a-million birds and 50,000 mammals since the disease was first detected in South America.They include 262,000 cormorants, 62,000 Peruvian pelicans, 32,000 sea lions and 4,000 Humboldt penguins."Updates from our Southern American colleagues are consistently distressing given the scale of mortality recorded on the continent," Dr Wille said.A network of avian influenza experts has reported the deaths of more than half a million birds and 50,000 mammals since the disease was first detected in South America. (Parks and Wildlife: Andrea Turbett)No indication of avian influenza 'slowing down'As a member for the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network, Dr Wille is bracing for avian influenza's anticipated spread across the vast icy wilderness."In the Antarctic, we have a high proportion of species that are found nowhere else in the world."So [the] effects could be catastrophic," she said.The continent is home to 48 bird species and 26 marine mammals, including many that congregate in small areas to breed.Antarctica is home to 48 bird species and 26 marine mammals. (AAD: Pat James)"[The impact] could include not only emblematic species such as Emperor Penguins, but all the incredible marine mammals are at risk as well."In addition to direct effects, like mass mortality events, we may also see ecosystem level impacts if so many animals are 'removed' from the ecosystems, which is what we saw following the mass removal of whales due to whaling."Fears about its spread are not limited to Antarctica.Scientists expect avian influenza to eventually reach Australia and other areas across the Pacific.The most likely incursion will come from Asia or North America, but researchers say it is plausible it could arrive from Antarctica."There is no indication that this devastation is slowing down anytime soon," Dr Wille said."I and all my colleagues are extremely distressed by the situation and the carnage we are observing globally."Experts are monitoring wildlife in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic for signs for the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. (Reuters: Natalie Thomas)Experts working with the Australian Antarctic Program have travelled to Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic this summer to monitor wildlife for signs of the H5N1 strain of the disease.The Australian Antarctic Division has also implemented precautionary protocols to reduce the risk of spreading avian influenza among birds, marine mammals, or even humans.As an added protection, Dr Wille is urging anyone who comes across dead birds or marine mammals in Australia not to touch them, and instead report it to the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline.LoadingLoading...Posted Sun 7 Jan 2024 at 6:22pmSunday 7 Jan 2024 at 6:22pmSun 7 Jan 2024 at 6:22pm, updated Mon 8 Jan 2024 at 6:38amMonday 8 Jan 2024 at 6:38amMon 8 Jan 2024 at 6:38amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily of teacher's aide killed in preschool crash pay tribute to 'cherished mother, wife, daughter'Topic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationRex given $80m lifeline, as ACCC warns Qantas controls 65pc of market and prices are upLIVEPhoto shows A Regional Express (REX) aircraft unloads at Charleville Airport in south-west Queensland.Four foreign nationals found on remote NT island say they paid money to be taken to AustraliaTopic:Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander)Photo shows Four people walk in the shallows of a coastline, with white backs slung over their shouldersRelated stories'We can't stop it': Bird flu strain that has devastated seabirds worldwide will likely reach Antarctica this yearTopic:BirdsPhoto shows A group of emperor penguins and their chicks standing on a snowy landscape in Antarctica.'Trust has been shattered': Leaked survey reveals ongoing cultural issues at Australian Antarctic DivisionTopic:WomenPhoto shows Mawson Station, AntarcticaA once in every 7.5 million year event is unfolding in the Antarctic.

This refers to when a viral infection causes inflammation of heart muscle tissue.Inflammation is the body’s natural reaction to an infection or injury to the heart. It typically occurs as part of an immune response to help protect the heart. However, long periods of inflammation can weaken and damage the heart, resulting in heart problems.There are many possible causes of heart inflammation. However, viral infections are a common cause of myocarditis. When a viral infection causes heart inflammation, it is known as viral myocarditis. Other people may also refer to it as viral heart disease.Types of viruses Share on PinterestMaskot/Getty ImagesMyocarditis involves inflammation in the myocardium. This is the middle muscular layer of the heart wall. In many cases, the exact cause of heart inflammation is unknown. However, viral infections are a common cause of myocarditis. According to a 2022 review, some of the most common viruses that cause viral myocarditis include the following:SARS-CoV-2SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for COVID-19. A 2023 review highlights that in the United States, COVID-19 was associated with a significant increase in myocarditis. Although rare, there are also reports of people experiencing myocarditis after receiving their COVID-19 vaccination.While more research is necessary, evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may trigger an autoimmune response that results in heart inflammation.HIVHIV is a virus that targets and weakens the immune system. This virus attacks white blood cells, which reduces the body’s ability to fight other infections and diseases.Evidence suggests that roughly one-third of people with an HIV infection may experience myocarditis. This may be directly due to HIV or due to opportunistic infections. A 2017 review suggests that HIV-associated myocarditis is common and can lead to HIV-associated heart failure. Parvovirus B19Parvovirus B19 is a virus that can cause a variety of symptoms. A common presentation of parvovirus B19 infection is known as fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum. It is also known as slapped cheek syndrome due to the distinct bright red rash that may occur on one or both cheeks.A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis notes a significant relationship between parvovirus B19 infection and myocarditis. A 2022 literature review highlights that parvovirus B19-induced myocarditis can be fatal in children.Human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6)HHV-6 refers to a set of herpes viruses, known as HHV-6A and HHV-6B. Evidence suggests that roughly 95% of adults worldwide are positive for at least one variant of HHV-6. This virus can result in a roseola rash. Research notes that health experts are recognizing HHV-6 as a common cause of myocarditis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)HCV can result in hepatitis C. This liver disease is a common blood-borne viral infection that can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. A 2021 review notes that HCV can also lead to many different heart problems, including myocarditis. InfluenzaInfluenza, or flu, is a common respiratory illness that results from a viral infection. There are four types of flu virus, with the two most common types being influenza A and influenza B.Evidence indicates that influenza can result in viral myocarditis. A 2022 literature review suggests that influenza A is more commonly associated with heart problems, such as myocarditis. Causes Viruses are one of the most common causes of heart inflammation. When an infection leads to myocarditis, health experts refer to it as infective myocarditis.Myocarditis can occur if the virus infects heart tissue. This can trigger an immune system reaction that may result in inflammation of heart muscle tissue. The immune system has many different defense mechanisms it can use to fight off viruses. Many of these mechanisms can result in inflammation.For example, when an infection causes tissue damage, the body stimulates a response to help heal these tissues. These signals activate certain immune cells that circulate to the site of damage. These cells can induce an inflammatory response. This inflammation aims to help remove the virus and initiate healing. However, inflammation can remain after resolving the viral infection, which can put stress on the heart. When inflammation of the heart muscle affects its function, health experts refer to it as inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Additionally, the viral infection itself can also damage heart tissue. If the virus is able to replicate and the immune system cannot clear the infection, it can lead to the death of heart muscle cells. Factors that may increase the risk of myocarditis can include:age, with myocarditis occurring more often in young adultssex, as myocarditis is more common in malesgenetics and a family history of heart problemsconsumption of too much alcoholrecreational drug usecertain medical conditions, such as HIV and diabetescertain medications, such as immunosuppressants SymptomsIt can be difficult to identify myocarditis due to a lack of specific symptoms. In fact, many people with myocarditis may not notice any symptoms. Possible symptoms of myocarditis can include, but are not limited to:chest pain or discomfort, such as a feeling of tightness in the chestshortness of breathfatigueheart palpitations or an irregular heartbeatlightheadedness or faintingflu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, headaches, body aches, joint pain, or sore throatswelling in the hands, legs, ankles, or feetSome people report that myocarditis can feel similar to a heart attack. If a person experiences any unexplained chest pain or shortness of breath, it is best to seek immediate medical help. DiagnosisTo diagnose myocarditis, a healthcare professional will initially ask about a person’s health and perform a physical exam. This may include checking for swelling, listening to the heart and lungs, taking the person’s temperature, and feeling for enlargement of the spleen.Additional tests that a doctor may then request can include:electrocardiogram (ECG)complete blood count (CBC)erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)C-reactive protein (CRP) levelsviral antibody titers echocardiogramcardiac MRIendomyocardial biopsy (EMB)troponin testTreatment optionsAt present, there is no specific or effective treatment for viral myocarditis. Initial treatment options are supportive and aim to preserve heart functioning. For example, healthcare professionals will treat high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythm, or heart failure.A doctor may also recommend intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). This therapy involves infusing a person with antibodies to help control the body’s immune and inflammatory response. However, more research is necessary to determine whether this treatment is effective. After the infection resolves, a doctor may also consider surgery. Options may include an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or pacemaker. These devices can help control irregular heartbeats or other heart rhythm problems. In some cases, a heart transplant may be necessary to treat heart failure that does not respond to other treatments.To try to prevent viral myocarditis, health experts recommend practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands often. Additionally, they recommend receiving vaccinations to reduce the risk of viral infections.SummaryViral heart disease, or viral myocarditis, refers to inflammation of heart muscle tissue following a viral infection. This inflammation can cause damage to the heart, which may result in heart problems. While more research is necessary to understand the exact mechanism, viral myocarditis likely occurs due to an overreaction of the immune system in response to a viral infection. Many viruses can cause myocarditis. Some examples include SARS-CoV-2, HIV, parvovirus B19, HHV-6, HCV, and influenza.

(Shutterstock)Social SharingCOVID-19 has killed 17 more New Brunswickers, including six over the holidays, while influenza has claimed nine lives. These are the first flu deaths of the season and they include a child under four, the latest data from the province shows.Dr. Yves Léger, the province's acting chief medical officer of health, held a rare meeting with reporters Tuesday because of the rise in respiratory illnesses.He warned about the high number of severe strep bacterial infections, which are "at least double" their usual rates, some of them fatal.Cases of respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV, are also climbing, and it may become a reportable disease in the province, Léger said."As you can imagine, with all those [respiratory illness] infections on the rise or peaking, a lot of people being sick, some of those will require medical care and some will require hospital admissions."This places additional pressure on our health-care system that's already strained, all the while having to deal with this increased demand when their staffing illness rates are also likely higher."WATCH | Dr. Yves Léger describes 'concerning trend' pressuring health-care system:N.B.'s top public health doctor says strep infections have doubled10 months agoDuration 0:54Acting chief medical officer of health Dr. Yves Léger says New Brunswick’s flu season is nearing its peak, with strep infections higher than in previous years.Léger urged people to take steps to protect themselves and others, such as staying home when sick, masking in public places and handwashing.Public Health also plans to step up its vaccination campaign messaging on social media over the coming weeks to try to encourage more New Brunswickers to get vaccinated, he said.Only about 15 per cent of the eligible population has been vaccinated against COVID-19 so far this season and 25 per cent against the flu. "Those are not the best numbers. It leaves a lot to be desired," said Léger."The respiratory illness season is here and it will still be around for a couple of months, so it will be beneficial to get vaccinated."About 100 group A streptococcal infectionsGroup A streptococcus, which causes illnesses such as strep throat and skin infections such as impetigo, "can in rare cases lead to more severe and sometimes life-threatening infections where the bacteria invades parts of the body, such as the blood, the deep muscles, fat tissues or the lungs," he said.The bacteria is spread by droplets from the nose and mouth.New Brunswick recorded roughly 100 cases of severe group A streptococcal infections in 2023, as of the end of October, said Léger. The typical annual average over the past five years has been about 50, he said.It's a "concerning trend" being seen across Canada and in other countries, according to Léger — one that experts can't yet explain."While the majority of our cases seem to occur in older individuals, we've seen increases in most of the other age groups as well," he told reporters, without providing any specifics.Asked specifically about deaths, Léger confirmed some people have died, but again did not provide further details. Anyone with symptoms, including bruises or cuts that might be infected, is encouraged to seek medical care, he said. Once people have been on antibiotics for 24 hours they're no longer contagious.RSV activity may soon peakLéger could not immediately provide any data on RSV cases, but did confirm "activity has been on the increase."He noted it's showing some signs "that we are reaching peak activity."The common respiratory virus, which most children contract by the age of two, usually causes a mild illness with cold-like symptoms. But the Public Health Agency of Canada says it can be severe for people aged 65 and older, infants and people who are immunocompromised. It can result in hospitalization and even death.Last fall and winter, New Brunswick recorded more than 1,500 RSV cases — the highest number in at least a decade."Last year was a bit of an outlier where we saw a very rapid, very high increase," said Léger. "The overall picture we're seeing so far this year is that of an RSV season that's more typical, similar to what we've seen in pre-pandemic years."Provincial officials are awaiting recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization on a new RSV vaccine recently approved by Health Canada. (Hau Dinh/The Associated Press)More than a year after Léger told reporters Public Health would look into following the lead of some other provinces and make RSV a reportable disease in New Brunswick, changes to the Public Health Act have been proposed, he said."That's currently making its way through the machinery of government." He could not provide any timeline.If RSV was a reportable disease under the Public Health Act, "laboratory staff from all regional hospitals would have to submit the result to the regional public health team, where additional information would be collected about each case for analysis," a Health Department spokesperson has said.As it stands, the province simply inputs RSV test data into the national surveillance system weekly. No information about RSV-related hospitalizations or deaths, or breakdowns by ages are available.Last week, Health Canada approved a new RSV vaccine for use in pregnancy to protect infants from birth to six months, and for seniors 60 and older. Léger could not say if or how soon New Brunswick might offer the vaccine. The province is awaiting recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, he said.COVID hospitalizes three children under 4New Brunswick continues to see "modest levels of COVID-19] activity across the province, which overall seems to remain fairly stable across most indicators at this time," according to Léger, referring to the latest Respiratory Watch report, which covers a three-week period, Dec. 10 to Dec. 30, instead of the usual one, because of the holidays.Two of the people who died from COVID were between 45 and 64, while the other 15 were aged 65 or older, the report shows.Their deaths raise the pandemic death toll to at least 989. Only confirmed cases who die in hospital are counted.More than 1,000 New Brunswickers have been hospitalized for or with COVID-19 since the respiratory season began on Aug. 27, while the flu has sent 239 people to hospital, according to the report. (Nathan Denette/Canadian Press)A total of 174 people were hospitalized for or with COVID during the three-week reporting period.Among them were three children under age four, 12 people aged 20 to 44, 26 aged 45 to 64 and 132 aged 65 or older.Eleven required intensive care.35 outbreaks, 13 in nursing homesThirty-five lab-confirmed COVID outbreaks were declared — 13 in nursing homes and 22 in "other facilities."There were 516 new cases of the virus confirmed through PCR (polymerase chain reaction) lab tests over the three weeks. The positivity rate remained stable at between 10 per cent and 14 per cent, the report says.There have been 129,097 XBB.1.5 COVID vaccines administered since Oct. 4, according to figures from the Department of Health.Flu rates higher than average seasonal peaksIn addition to the child aged 0-4, the flu killed a person aged 45 to 64, and seven people aged 65 or older, the report shows.Four of the nine deaths occurred between Dec. 24 and Dec. 30.The flu sent 174 people to hospital during the three reporting weeks, including six children under four and five youth aged five to 19. Twenty-three people were admitted to intensive care, one of whom is under 19.The number of influenza tests conducted and positive results between Dec. 10 and Dec. 30 are well above the historical averages for the seasons 2017-18 to 2022-23, data from the province shows. (Government of New Brunswick)The rate of lab-confirmed flu cases was significantly higher during the three reporting weeks than the average seasonal peak between 2017-18 and 2022-23, which is usually later in the winter, the data shows.There were 1,143 new cases confirmed. Almost all were influenza A and two were influenza B.These raise the total number of flu cases since the respiratory reason began on Aug. 27 to 1,501.The positivity rate jumped from 21 per cent to 29 per cent over the three weeks, the report shows."There [are] signs that we are starting to perhaps plateau or reach that peak," and will have a season similar to those pre-pandemic, said Léger. "We'll see in the next week or two if that is confirmed.The regional distribution of the flu cases includes: Moncton region, Zone 1 — 303. Saint John region, Zone 2 — 147. Fredericton region, Zone 3 — 249. Edmundston region, Zone 4 — 64. Campbellton region, Zone 5 — 44. Bathurst region, Zone 6 — 254. Miramichi region, Zone 7 — 82. A total of 200,707 New Brunswickers have been vaccinated against the flu since Oct. 4.

Some symptoms for RSV include runny nose, decrease in appetite, fever, coughing or sneezing. Make sure to call your doctor if you or your child is having difficulty breathing, not drinking enough fluids, or experiencing worsening symptoms.”Dr. Kevin Dazy, pediatrician with Children’s Hospital of Michigan:“We are still seeing a lot of our three worrisome viruses: RSV, flu and COVID. I think RSV is starting to come down just a bit, as in I think we are now past the RSV peak for the season. Influenza and COVID remains concerning to me. Most cases are not requiring kids to be hospitalized – although some are. But we are seeing milder illness in kids in the form of cold symptoms like coughing, runny nose and fevers.”Dr. Jennifer Stevenson, Emergency Department, Henry Ford Medical Center Fairlane:“There’s a ton of influenza, COVID-19 and we’re still seeing a lot of strep pharyngitis going around. This would be an excellent time for people to get their flu shots if they haven’t already. Also, I’ll suggest again that folks consider wearing masks if they need to be out and about and feel upper respiratory infection symptoms. No one likes to be sick!”OAKLAND COUNTY -– COVID, stomach viruses, strep throatDr. Steven McGraw, Chair of Emergency Medicine, Ascension Providence Hospital, Novi & Southfield Campus:“Our rate of respiratory illnesses continues to rise, similar to all of our surrounding hospitals. We’re also seeing patients with stomach viruses and strep throat. This is a reminder for everyone to cover their cough, get their COVID-19 booster and flu shots. Please also look out for neighbors who may have difficulty shoveling the snow after this week’s storms. Limit the amount of snow being lifted with each shovel and also look out for others who need help in the neighborhood.”Clarkston Medical Group:Flu, mostly type B. Some COVID, RSV and HFM.Sarah Rauner, chief pediatric nurse practitioner, Corewell Health’s Beaumont Hospital, Troy:“We are in the heart of our respiratory season. We are seeing predominately RSV, influenza, and some COVID. Early data is showing a less severe volume of RSV cases than last year. We are also seeing other viral upper respiratory illnesses. All of these can be more difficult for our asthmatic children. Get your vaccines up to date if you can, wash your hands and stay home if you are newly sick and/or feverish.”Dr. Susan Bork, director of operations, Emergency Center, Corewell Health’s William Beaumont University Hospital, Royal Oak:“The emergency department has been experiencing high volumes over the past week. Influenza A is starting to surge and is spreading within the community while we continue to see some RSV, COVID and other upper respiratory illnesses. The best protection is always hand washing and avoidance of close contact with those who are ill.”Emergency Department/Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital/Oakland:“We are seeing a lot of respiratory issues, flu-like symptoms and abdominal pain are the illnesses we are seeing in our Emergency Department.”WASHTENAW COUNTY -– InfluenzaWashtenaw County Health Department:The Health Department reports influenza cases are on the rise, with a similar increase in flu hospitalizations. They also reported their first influenza death in an older adult last week.MACOMB COUNTY –- GastroenteritisDr. Joseph Carlier, an emergency physician at McLaren Macomb, reports:GastroenteritisCases of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea resulting from viral gastroenteritis have continued to be reported in high volume.Viral URIsAdults testing positive for influenza and RSV have noticeably increased, presenting with symptoms of fever, congestion, body aches, and fatigue.COVID-19Patients testing positive for COVID-19 remains steady, with the majority of patients experiencing mild symptoms and not requiring hospitalization.Dr. Maria Samuel/Primary Care Physician, HENRY FORD MEDICAL CENTER STERLING HEIGHTS/Macomb:“We’re seeing more COVID-19, influenza and RSV this week.

Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being. CNN — The winter surge of respiratory viruses is underway. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to record rising levels of hospitalizations associated with Covid-19 as well as increasing hospitalizations for influenza and the respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV. Young man washing hands - stock photo Solskin/Digital Vision/Getty Images Did you gather in large groups for the holidays? A virus may be your post-holiday present Many ill people are reporting that their symptoms are lasting for more than a week, even up to two weeks for some. Is this normal? What should your expectations be about the length of viral respiratory illnesses? When should you contact your doctor for additional testing? And what other steps could you take to facilitate your recovery? For example, is it advisable to work, go to school or exercise? To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner. CNN: Many of us have friends and colleagues who are experiencing weeks of virus symptoms. Is this normal? Dr. Leana Wen: There are three issues to consider here. First, let’s discuss how long symptoms typically persist for some common illnesses. For a regular cold, symptoms tend to peak within the first few days after they start. However, some symptoms, especially a runny or stuffy nose or cough, can last up to 14 days, according to the CDC. Similarly, though those infected with influenza are typically better within seven days, some could have symptoms lasting over two weeks. And the same goes for RSV, the coronavirus and other viruses. Most symptoms generally peak within the first week, and most people are better within two weeks, but it’s not uncommon for some people’s recovery to take longer. With a cold, a cough may last up to two weeks, the CDC says, but some people who experience viral illnesses may have a cough that lasts several weeks. Charday Penn/E+/Getty Images Second, it’s not unusual for some specific symptoms to linger even after others resolve. For instance, some people may develop a persistent cough that lasts several weeks, while other symptoms like body aches and fever could be gone within a few days. Ekaterina Goncharova/Moment RF/Getty Images Long Covid is hard — here are five tips to help This is especially true for people who have underlying lung disease, for whom the virus could have worsened that condition. Someone with asthma might need to use their inhaler more in the weeks or months following their infection, for example. Then there are also post-viral conditions, such as long Covid, that are associated with ongoing symptoms like fatigue and brain fog. These symptoms could last for months or longer. Third, it’s also possible that someone who thinks they have one long viral illness is actually experiencing multiple rounds of viral infections. Kids in school and day care, for instance, may have one viral illness that is just beginning to resolve when they contract another one. They may even contract more than one virus at the same time. What seems like a prolonged recovery may really be several overlapping viruses. CNN: When should people decide to seek additional medical care? Wen: First and most importantly, what is the age of the individual and what are their preexisting medical conditions? People at the extremes of ages — newborns and elderly individuals — are more likely to become severely ill from viral illnesses. Those with underlying medical conditions like heart and lung disease and who are immunocompromised are also more vulnerable. These individuals should seek additional medical care sooner. Ideally, they should already have a plan with their primary care provider about what kinds of symptoms should prompt them to get care. Everyone should know how to reach their provider after hours and, if this is not possible, to have a plan for which emergency room or urgent care they will go to if a need arises. Ill woman looking at thermometer at home. Guido Mieth/Digital Vision/Getty Images As respiratory viruses spread everywhere, what should you do if you get sick? Another factor is whether testing has been done. Do you already know which virus is causing your symptoms? Some people might have already tested positive for, say, Covid-19, and have started an antiviral treatment. Have you also had a chest X-ray? Getting additional testing is one reason to seek medical care, and someone who just underwent tests may not need them repeated so soon. Still, they should contact their medical provider to be certain, especially if they are in a vulnerable group. A third key factor is time and the progression of your symptoms. If it’s been 10 days but your symptoms are improving, that’s a different story from if it’s been over two weeks and now you have new or worse symptoms. Symptoms that should prompt urgent care would include shortness of breath, chest pain and inability to keep down fluids. Also, if your symptoms improved but then got worse again, it’s possible that you could have a second, different infection. If you are eligible for antiviral treatment, consider contacting your physician to see if you could be tested for flu or Covid-19. There is also the possibility that you could have something other than a viral respiratory infection. Some people who first have a viral infection could then develop a bacterial infection. Or perhaps your symptoms are due to something other than an infection. The fatigue you’re experiencing could be a sign of anemia or thyroid dysfunction, for instance. A final factor to consider is to listen to your body. Your doctor is the expert when it comes to medicine, but you are the expert when it comes to yourself. You know your body the best. If something doesn’t feel right, that’s another reason to seek care sooner rather than later. CNN: What should you expect if you do reach out to your doctor, and what questions should you ask? Wen: Your doctor may schedule an in-person or virtual appointment with you. They will ask you about your symptoms, so make sure you bring a detailed description of how you’ve felt and how the symptoms changed — or not — over time. Describe what treatments you’ve tried and whether they’ve helped. Be sure to mention a particular symptom that is concerning to you. Smiling male fitness instructor practicing dumbbell exercise with men in gym Maskot/Digital Vision/Getty Images 5 key health resolutions for 2024 You could be recommended to receive additional testing, such as viral tests, blood tests or a chest X-ray. Questions to ask include what these tests are intended to show, as well as what to do if the tests are negative. Should you continue supportive treatments such as fluids and fever-reducing medications? Are there other diagnoses that your doctor is considering? If tests are not recommended at this time, when might they be in the future? CNN: What other steps could you take to facilitate your recovery? For example, is it advisable to work, go to school or exercise? Wen: Most viral illnesses self-resolve, which means that they go away on their own without specific treatment. How people recover depends a lot on what they’ve done in the past and what their condition is at present. Some people need a lot of rest. Others prefer to keep busy and continue light exercise. All of these are generally reasonable options, and people should discuss individual circumstances with their health care provider.

Both COVID-19 and the flu are spreading rapidly across the US. By: Dr. Partha Nandi Posted (WXYZ) — In today’s Health Alert, the country is grappling with a surge in respiratory illnesses. Both COVID-19 and the flu are spreading rapidly across the US. Michigan, in particular, is seeing a high level of flu activity, with the first flu-related death reported in Washtenaw County. I’ve noticed that many people, including patients and friends, have become sick with either one.As for when cases might plateau, there is no clear peak in sight at the moment. Traditionally, the flu tends to peak sometime in midwinter, usually between December and February. However, it did get a later start this season, so it could run into the spring. Unlike the flu, COVID-19 technically does not have an official season since it causes disease all year round. But generally, we see more cases, hospitalizations, and deaths from November through April, with higher rates during the winter months.Most states are reporting “high” or “very high” levels. According to the CDC, at least 10 million illnesses have occurred since the start of October. Over 20,000 people were hospitalized for the flu in the week ending Dec. 30, and there have been 6,500 deaths from flu, including the Michigan resident who passed away in Washtenaw County. That adult was reported to be older, with underlying high-risk conditions.Turning to COVID-19, the number of cases is higher than last season’s peak. But hospitalizations and deaths are lower than in past seasons. That said, more people are ending up in the hospital due to COVID-19 compared to the flu, with over 34,700 hospitalizations reported for the week ending Dec. 30.Health experts, including myself, still recommend masks. N95, KN95, and KF94 masks offer the best protection, while cloth masks are less effective. It’s important that your mask fits well and is worn correctly. I highly recommend that you wear them in crowded indoor areas. Also, before heading out the door, it’s a good idea to look up your county’s respiratory virus trends on the CDC’s website - www.cdc.govespiratory-viruses - to see how high the activity is near you.Besides masking, vaccination is extremely important. Most reported flu cases to date are influenza A strains, with occasional cases of influenza B reported. And this season's flu shot is reported to be well-matched. As for COVID-19, the vaccine still provides some protection against the newest variant, JN.1.Remember, vaccines are recommended for everyone six months and older. And it’s really important for people aged 60 and up to get vaccinated as they’re most likely to fall severely ill. There is still time to get the shots to help protect yourself and your loved ones.

Poultry producers are quarantining their animals after avian flu hit Pennsylvania in late Dec.The Pa. Department of Agriculture detected avian flu at a private poultry game farm on Dec. 24. High Path Avian Influenza (HPAI) is highly contagious and usually leads to the animal’s death. Infected birds present with pneumonia-like symptoms before death, making euthanasia the most humane option, according to the Pa. Game Commission.Ian Gregg, the commission’s Wildlife Operations Division Chief, worries that Mahantongo Game Farm may be affected. It’s less than three miles away from where avian flu was found and it’s the commission’s pheasant hunting supply farm.“If that avian influenza outbreak on the non-Game Commission facility would’ve spread to the facility where we obtain our pheasant chicks from, obviously they would have that same requirement to depopulate their entire flock,” said Gregg.Mahantongo often keeps around 300,000 day-old chicks at a time. The state’s whole pheasant hunting program would be jeopardized if Mahantongo is affected, according to Gregg.It’s been two weeks since avian flu was found, and Mahantongo has not shown any signs of the virus. Gregg said the commission’s quarantining their breeding stock.“It’s being held over winter over at our Loyalsock Game Farm. We also held back some of the pheasants, primarily hens, that we would’ve stocked in the late seasons. And those are being held in our Southwest Game Farm, so we sort of have…our eggs not all in one basket,” said Gregg.Penn State Extension’s Poultry Educator Gregory Martin said the commission is compartmentalizing their animals. For biosecurity, and especially during an outbreak, producers should keep their birds separate from other birds to limit spreading viruses.“For example, we did not see birds at the Farm Show this year,” said Martin. “Simply because we didn’t want a whole bunch of people to congregate together for a week and then go back to all different parts of the state. If one bird got sick and spread something within the farm show and then it went out to all the other areas of the state, we could of had a really bad situation.” AIMEE DILGER At the Luzerne County Fair, 4-H kids put photos of their chickens in cages to protect their actual pets from catching avian flu. Until the virus is fully controlled, Martin recommends for producers to take decisive action. Besides changing clothes and washing their hands before working with their animals, they should limit who comes onto the farm.“We would restrict at this point in time visitors to the farm. And so unless you have a good reason for being there, you shouldn’t be there,” said Gregg. “I’m even suggesting that people reroute deliveries to a neutral area on the farm or actually some other place like a drop box or something at the end of the lane so that the farm doesn’t have any foreign vehicles driving on it.”Gregg also said that farmers can disinfect the wheels of vehicles on their farm as another precautionary measure.As of early Jan., there is one case of avian flu in Pa. Nearly 100,000 birds were affected. Local Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Isabela Weiss | WVIA News | Report for America Isabela Weiss is a storyteller turned reporter from Athens, GA.

(Photo by Hans Gutknecht, Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG) By Kristy Hutchings | khutchings@scng.com and John Orona | jorona@scng.comUPDATED: January 10, 2024 at 3:59 PM PSTNow would be a good time to stock up on cough medicine, tissues and tea – as a trio of viruses is making the winter season miserable for Southern California residents and health care professionals.Coronavirus transmission, just like every winter since 2020, has once again increased as temperatures have declined, though not quite to the level of last year’s surge. Then there’s influenza and respiratory syncytial virus – or RSV – which, health care professionals said this week, have returned with a vengeance.The causes of the triple spike, according to health officials, are fairly prosaic: Viruses generally thrive in cold weather. Holiday gatherings are a human buffet for viruses. And, after three years of intense diligence about being inoculated against the coronavirus, vaccine fatigue has set in.The result is that the number of people contracting one or more of these respiratory viruses has been on the rise since before Christmas. And even though the severity is nothing like the carnage seen at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, emergency room visits are up – and hospitals are feeling the pressure.“We started to see more respiratory illnesses the week before Christmas,” Dr. Suman Radhakrishna, an infectious disease specialist with Dignity Health California Hospital, said in a Thursday, Jan. 4, interview. “It was a mishmash of a lot of different things.”Public health agencies use a smattering of metrics, aside from just a total count of new COVID-19 cases, to determine the full breadth of coronavirus spread in a given region. And for many Southern California health care providers, most of the metrics have been on the upswing over the past few weeks.In Los Angeles County, for example, there were 542 new COVID-19 cases reported daily, on average, this week, a decrease from the 621 daily average cases reported last week.A sign outside the emergency room telling visitors that masks are required to enter Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, Thursday Jan. 4, 2024.

(Photo by Hans Gutknecht, Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG) ExpandBut, according to the LA County Department of Public Health, the decrease is likely because a fewer number of reportable tests were conducted during the holidays. A majority of folks also self-test at home and don’t report positive results to the county, DPH said. Wastewater concentration, though, has increased notably since last week, DPH said.Related Articles News | U.S. Department of Agriculture bans school lunch fees for low-income families News | LA County sues Coke, Pepsi over alleged impact of plastic bottles on environment, public health News | New dengue cases confirmed in Baldwin Park, Hollywood Hills News | Chiquita Canyon Landfill meeting draws hundreds of angry residents News | Marimix relaunches healthier lineup after OC snack maven has near-death scare That metric, which is the amount of COVID-19 detected in sewage water, provides public health agencies with a better understanding of how COVID-19 is spreading – and its potential to strain the health care system.LA County’s wastewater concentration this week was 49% of last year’s winter COVID-19 surge, a substantial peak from the 36-39% reported over the past three weeks.The metrics in Pasadena and Long Beach, both of which have their own health departments, are similar, as are those in Orange County, though on a smaller scale.The good news, though, is that the metrics are nowhere near the levels reported during the height of the pandemic, Radhakrishna said – and the symptoms, generally, are not as severe.“We’re not seeing that, and I hope we never do again,” Radhakrishna said about coronavirus transmission this winter compared to past years. “Now, (COVID-19) is behaving like a bad head cold.”But the rising coronavirus metrics do not exist in a vacuum. Instead, increased coronavirus spread has coincided with a rise in influenza and RSV transmission.Some patients, in fact, have been diagnosed with multiple viruses at once.When combined, the respiratory viruses can also cause more severe problems, Radhakrishna said, particularly for those with underlying health problems, such as heart disease or diabetes.“They are sick like dogs because they have two infections rather than one,” she said. “People will recover from it — but it takes a longer period of time.”Flu and RSV, like the coronavirus, have also been detected at greater levels in LA County, with 22.9% of tested samples positive for the flu and 10.3% positive for RSV, according to DPH data for the week ending on Dec. 23.It’s much the same in Long Beach and Pasadena.The situation in Orange County, meanwhile, is not as severe. The Orange County Health Care Agency’s latest data indicates 8.3% of influenza lab tests were positive, after peaking the week prior at 8.9%. The RSV positivity rate crescendoed at 9.5% in the last week of November and was at 7.9% this week.The coronavirus, influenza and RSV triad, meanwhile, have caused hospital visits and admissions to increase as well.At Pasadena’s Huntington Hospital, for example, coronavirus infections have steadily climbed since mid-November, and the facility had 38 COVID-19-positive patients this week — six of whom were in the intensive-care unit.But this year, officials said, the flu and RSV are causing the more severe symptoms.“Influenza as well as RSV have definitely come back with a vengeance,” Dr. Thomas Yadegar, the medical director of Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana’s intensive care unit, said on Thursday, noting that many hospitals are hitting capacity as folks with those viruses flood emergency rooms.About 10.5% of all emergency department encounters in the county were for influenza-like illnesses for the week ending Dec. 23, DPH said.But while influenza and RSV are increasingly problematic, COVID-19 is still dominant among the triumvirate.LA County, for example, had an average of 783 people admitted to hospitals with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis this week, up from 690 per day the week prior.Hospitalizations related to COVID-19, in fact, have increased significantly since late December, to the point that the county on Dec. 27 moved into the “medium” admissions category, as determined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The CDC has a three-tiered system to help public health agencies determine COVID-19 transmission levels and their impact on the health care system.It also has set public health protocols in relation to each tier, which are low, medium and high.LA County hit the medium tier in late December after its COVID-19-related hospital admissions topped 10 per 100,000 people daily.As a result, all health care personnel working in licensed facilities providing inpatient care are now required to wear a mask when in contact with patients or in patient-care areas, according to DPH.The masking requirement will be lifted when the county’s numbers drop below the medium hospital admissions level.Orange County’s hospitalization levels also recently passed into the medium tier, according to Dec. 30 data, which showed that 320 people were admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 during the most recent reporting period — a 19% jump from the week prior.Southern California isn’t alone.Hospitals across the country are also feeling the brunt of the viral triumvirate, with high levels of flu-like illness reported in 31 states just before Christmas. Many health care facilities have now begun requiring patients, visitors and personnel to once again wear masks to help prevent additional cases of each virus.“What you’re hearing is unfortunately true,” Yadegar said. “There’s definitely been an increase in influenza cases, as well as COVID.”The respiratory illnesses, though, aren’t just taking their toll on patients, Yadegar said – but also hospital staffers and doctors.“So many nurses have fallen sick,” he said. “We’ve had a lot of nurses not able to come to work. Many are working extra shifts — and that makes it tougher.”Vaccine fatigue is also an issue.Vaccinations for all three diseases are down this year, according to CDC data. That could be a contributing factor to the viruses’ increased visibility this season, health care professionals said, even though natural immunity has helped keep transmission from spiking out of control.About 44% of U.S. adults had gotten flu shots by Dec. 23, according to the most recently available CDC data. Only about 19% of U.S. adults were reported to have received an updated COVID-19 shot as of early December.“That’s probably one of the reasons we’re seeing quite a bit of disease,” said Dr. Kimberly Shriner, Huntington Hospital’s infectious disease and tropical medical specialist. “I think people have kind of gotten that vaccine fatigue.”Some folks, Shriner added, may be under the false impression that the first rounds of the COVID-19 vaccine were enough to protect them from the disease for a lifetime.“Unfortunately, it’s just gonna be like the flu — in fact, even maybe a little bit more challenging than the flu,” Shriner said, “since you have to get vaccinated every six months to certainly every year.”Radhakrishna agreed about the fatigue.“I get it,” she said. “I’ve been jabbed so many times I’m tired of it, too — but people kind of forgot about influenza and COVID.”Public agencies, from Los Angeles to Orange counties, have fought against complacency, repeatedly encouraging folks to stay updated on all vaccines, and to get tested for COVID-19 frequently.“With higher COVID-19 transmission levels in Los Angeles County – along with other respiratory viruses – and many residents returning to school and work after the holidays,” DPH said in a Thursday news release, “(DPH) is encouraging residents to test if they have COVID-19 symptoms to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”Those who get a positive COVID-19 result — especially folks with underlying health conditions — should consider their medication options as soon as possible.Antivirals, including Paxlovid, can help treat symptoms more quickly and reduce the risk of long COVID, according to DPH.But that drug isn’t for everyone, according to Radhakrishna — and many patients have reported not liking the drug because of its strong taste.“Is (Paxlovid) being used as much as we’d like it to be used in the community? Probably not,” Radhakrishna said. “But it is being used.”Health officials are also urging folks to consider masking indoors — especially in crowded spaces — to avoid catching any of the winter respiratory illnesses currently circulating.And if you’re feeling sick, stay home.“As we enjoy the winter season and enjoy more indoor activities,” Jennifer Bayer, a spokesperson for Tenet Healthcare, which includes hospitals in Fountain Valley, Los Alamitos and Placentia, said in a statement, “we urge our community to proactively protect themselves and others by staying home when they feel under the weather, wearing a mask when possible and using good hand hygiene.Having a handy supply of cold medicine and tissues wouldn’t hurt either.For more information about COVID-19 vaccines and testing, visit myturn.ca.gov and ph.lacounty.gov/COVIDtests.Staff writers Ryan Carter and Michael Slaten, as well as the Associated Press, contributed to this report.

She has joined the shoot of her upcoming drama, a zombie story titled 'Influenza'. A fan spotted the K-Pop idol shooting for her upcoming venture in Seoul. She has joined forces with actor Park Jung Min in this Korean drama. Image courtesy: Jisoo/Instagram Fans of BLACKPINK's Jisoo were overjoyed when she was seen shooting scenes for her upcoming zombie K-drama, âInfluenza.â News first surfaced on August 31, 2023, that she had been invited to join the cast of this highly anticipated show, along with actor Park Jung Min.On January 8, an excited fan spotted Jisoo filming in a neighborhood in Seoul. Accompanied by a team of staff scouting locations, Jisoo's return to the screen was a delight for fans who fondly remembered her roles in the romance-war K-drama âSnowdropâ and her cameo appearances in âDr.Cheonâ and âLost Talisman.â Last December 4, the singer confirmed her participation in âInfluenza,â an adaptation of Han Sang Woon's novel set to be released on Coupang Play. The story unfolds against the backdrop of a Seoul high-rise building civil defense unit, focusing on soldier Jaeyoon and his girlfriend Yeongju as they navigate a zombie onslaught.According to reports, actor Park Jung Min plays Jaeyoon, a soldier who enlists at a later age, while Jisoo portrays Yeongju, patiently awaiting her military-bound boyfriend's return.It was recently revealed that Jisoo is set to oversee her solo projects through her brother's company, BIOMOM, however there has been no official confirmation about the same. Speculation about Jisoo's role in the venture arose after the business plan was unveiled through a recruitment notice for BLISSOO, the entertainment branch of BIOMOM.It's worth noting that all four BLACKPINK members â Jennie, RosÃ©, Lisa, and Jisoo â won't be renewing their solo contracts with YG Entertainment. However, they will continue their group activities under the agency. On December 6, 2023, Yang Hyun Suk, the executive producer of YG Entertainment, expressed the agency's joy in maintaining their partnership with BLACKPINK, pledging steadfast support for their future endeavors in the global music market.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories PreviousSonam Bajwaâs enchanting ethnic looks to get inspired fromEntertainment10 benefits of chewing paan after every mealFood10 lesser-known benefits of consuming Sweet PotatoesFoodâWhat is far-infrared therapy good for?âLifestyle10 gorgeous red saris to choose from on Karwachauth 2024LifestyleDecoded: How many calories these common South Indian foods haveFoodStruggling to trust others?

That’s according to figures from the SiVIRA respiratory infection monitoring system at the Carlos III health institute, which show that flu cases are currently circulating with ‘greater intensity than the rest of the respiratory viruses’, including Covid-19. Influenza A is causing the highest number of patients to resort to Spanish emergency rooms, according to Pascual Piñera, the vice-president of the SEMES society for emergency medicine. Speaking to news agency Efe, Piñera said that there were 35% more patients requesting emergency care right now compared to this time last year. Of these 10% are being admitted to hospitals, which ‘have nowhere to put these patients’, he added. Flu symptoms and Covid symptoms are very similar, but there are ways to tell the difference. Influenza A symptoms and those of Covid are usually very similar, and include fever, muscular pain, coughing, fatigue and a sore throat. Speaking to newspaper El Español, Lorenzo Armenteros, from the SEMG Spanish GP’s society, said that fatigue is more common with Covid, while muscular pain suggests flu. For flu patients, these symptoms usually last a week, but some patients suffer from them for as long as 10 days. Armenteros added that this ‘massive spike’ in cases was predictable, given the increased number of social events during the Christmas season. “We are currently suffering the consequences of social interactions on Christmas Eve, in seven days we will see the results of New Years Eve, and in the third week of January, we will have the biggest epidemic peak, as a result of Kings Day [January 6], and the return to schools and university,” he explained.

Information gathered from health experts working in the private and public sectors revealed that while influenza cases were reported almost every year with the onset of winter, this season had been seeing a continued wave of the illness that still persisted, though hospitalisation and mortalities had been very low, largely involving the elderly. “Every second patient that we have been examining at our clinics over the past few weeks is suffering from the flu. Most of them are presenting with cough, fever, chest tightness and complaints of headache,” senior general practitioner (GP) Dr Altaf Hussain Khatri, also representing the Pakistan Medical Association-Karachi, said. Some of these cases were traced to be Covid, he pointed out, while referring to the experiences of his colleague physicians. “There were also patients who seemed to have Covid but were not tested for the illness. In both cases, we ask patients to follow all protocols required for Covid,” he said, while linking the respiratory infections to environmental factors, including deteriorating air quality. According to Dr Abdul Wahid Rajput, Medical Superintendent of the Sindh Infectious Disease Hospital, the facility has been seeing a higher load of flu cases since mid-December. “Out of the 750 flu patients who reported at our clinics, 200 were children. There were 56 admissions with no mortality. Some patients tested positive for Covid,” he said, adding that hospitalisation involved patients with compromised immunity and the elderly reporting with multiple health problems. However, Dr Yayha Tunio, deputy executive director at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, was of the opinion that the pattern was similar to what was seen every year in the winter season. “There is no reason for alarm. Most people are recovering without experiencing any complications,” he said, while emphasising the need for preventive measures. Mortalities reported The Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) has also seen a surge in influenza cases this season starting from October. “While testing was limited in November and December, our laboratory has reported close to 100 cases each month,” said Dr Faisal Mahmood, head of the Infectious Diseases Department at the AKUH. He explained that the influenza virus, like the virus which caused Covid (the SARS CoV2 virus), might cause severe disease. “This includes coughing, body aches, high fever and even death. In fact, this season we have had some deaths as well, especially in the elderly and in those with other medical problems,” he revealed. Dr Mahmood seconded the opinion that the 2023-24 season had seen a higher number of influenza cases as compared to the last 2022-23 winter season. “It’s three to four times higher this season compared to last season. This season the strain is H3N2. Last season it was H1N1 (what used to be called swine flu in 2009).” About the reasons behind the higher number of cases, Dr Mahmood said the virus mutated every year and so every few years there’s an outbreak. “Also the influenza vaccine coverage is poor. Finally, the immunity against the virus in the community is also lower than the pre-Covid period as influenza rates had dropped because of the precautions people were taking for Covid.” About prevention, Dr Mahmood said there was a medicine available which reduced the risk of severe infection, but it needed to be used early. “The prevention is similar to the way we prevent Covid. Masking especially if one is sick and keeping hands clean. There is a vaccine, which is updated every year as the influenza virus keeps mutating. The ideal time to get the vaccine is in October or November.” Published in Dawn, January 7th, 2024 Pakistan Email Your Name*Cancel 0 Read more Vector-borne diseases rise in Sindh amid lack of fumigation Conference demands plan to amend Irsa Act be dropped, six-canal project shelved Stray bullet kills eight-year-old Karachi boy Sponsored Revolutionising reproductive health: Viya launches Viya Telehealth On DawnNews خواتین میں مظاہروں کا بڑھتا ہوا رجحان اور پولیس تشدد کی افسوس ناک روایت ‘کیا میں عورت ہونے یا کسی کی زوجہ بننے کے معیار پر پورا نہیں اترتی؟’ جسٹس قاضی فائز عیسیٰ ایک سال میں وہ کچھ کرگئے جو دیگر ججز نہ کرسکے Dawn News English What Trump’s Return Could Mean For America How Did Trump Break The Blue Wall?

Photo: David Schultz / Mint Images via AFP By Jano Gibson for the ABC It's only a suspected case for now, but the discovery in the past week of a single bird with potential avian influenza could mark the realisation of scientists' worst fears. For months, the highly contagious and deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has been tearing a path of devastation across South America. Now there are concerns the disease may have finally reached the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, on the western side of the continent. "The impact will potentially be catastrophic," Dr. Michelle Wille, a senior research fellow at the Centre for Pathogen Genomics at the University of Melbourne, said. The suspected case, which is listed on the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network's database, involves a gull-like bird known as a brown skua. It was observed by researchers on an outcrop called Heroina Island. Getting confirmation of the case is difficult, as samples cannot always be collected in remote locations. And even if they are, it can take many days, if not weeks, to analyse them at laboratories thousands of kilometres away. If the latest suspected case is avian influenza, it would be the closest the disease has been to Antarctica, after previously being detected as near as the Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island. Preventing its further spread across the frozen continent - including the vast section in the east claimed by Australia - is near impossible. "In South America, the virus travelled the entire 6,000-kilometre spine in about six months," Wille said. "So this virus has the capacity to move vast distances, fast. "We can only hope that it does not reach the Australian Antarctic Territory this austral summer. "If it does, it will likely do so with a trail of destruction." Elephant seal pups suffer 70 percent mortality rate A study released late last month reaffirmed the devastating impact of the disease. The report, published in Marine Mammal Science, analysed data from an outbreak among southern elephant seals at Peninsula Valdez in Argentina in early October. About 70 percent of the 1891 seal pups born along a 13-kilometre stretch of coastline during the peak breeding season died. During the same period a year earlier, the mortality rate was less than 1 percent. By extrapolating the results across the region's entire colony, researchers estimate around 17,400 seal pups succumbed to the deadly disease. Where thousands of weaned pups would normally be expected in late October and early November, only 58 were seen. The researchers also observed dozens of adult seal carcasses in an area where seeing dead adults is a rare event. Other seals displayed symptoms including head tremors, lack of coordination, and nasal discharges. But it is not just southern elephant seals that have been affected by avian influenza. A network of avian influenza experts, known as OFFLU, has reported the deaths of more than half-a-million birds and 50,000 mammals since the disease was first detected in South America. They include 262,000 cormorants, 62,000 Peruvian pelicans, 32,000 sea lions and 4000 Humboldt penguins. "Updates from our Southern American colleagues are consistently distressing given the scale of mortality recorded on the continent," Wille said. No indication of avian influenza 'slowing down' As a member for the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network, Wille is bracing for avian influenza's anticipated spread across the vast icy wilderness. "In the Antarctic, we have a high proportion of species that are found nowhere else in the world. "So [the] effects could be catastrophic," she said. The continent is home to 48 bird species and 26 marine mammals, including many that congregate in small areas to breed. "[The impact] could include not only emblematic species such as Emperor Penguins, but all the incredible marine mammals are at risk as well. "In addition to direct effects, like mass mortality events, we may also see ecosystem level impacts if so many animals are 'removed' from the ecosystems, which is what we saw following the mass removal of whales due to whaling." Fears about its spread are not limited to Antarctica. Scientists expect avian influenza to eventually reach Australia and other areas across the Pacific. The most likely incursion will come from Asia or North America, but researchers say it is plausible it could arrive from Antarctica. "There is no indication that this devastation is slowing down anytime soon," Wille said. "I and all my colleagues are extremely distressed by the situation and the carnage we are observing globally." Experts working with the Australian Antarctic Program have travelled to Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic this summer to monitor wildlife for signs of the H5N1 strain of the disease. The Australian Antarctic Division has also implemented precautionary protocols to reduce the risk of spreading avian influenza among birds, marine mammals, or even humans. - This story was first published by the ABC.

Trends of the week COVID-19: Decrease in the number of cases and the positivity rate of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): Decrease in the number of RSV cases. Influenza: Slight decrease in the number of influenza cases. COVID-19 / SARS-CoV-2 From 1 to 7 January 2024 (week 1), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 dropped to 240 cases, compared to 338 cases the previous week (-29%). The positivity rate fell to 14% compared to 20% the previous week. The concentration of viruses detected in wastewater also fell substantially [1]. These indicators suggest that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has decreased, which is probably linked to departures during the end-of-year holidays. The latest sequencing data available for weeks 48-50 show a preponderance of the JN.1 variant (60.9%) (95% CI 52.0-69.8%) followed by the BA.2.86 variant (11.3%) (95% CI: 5.5-17.1%) and the XBB.1.9 variant (10.4%) (95% CI: 4.9-16.2%) [2]. It should be noted that the JN.1 variant is a descendant of the BA.2.86 variant with an additional mutation on its spike protein. Influenza For the week of 1 January to 7 January 2024 (week 1), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories decreased to 332 cases from 371 cases in the previous week, a decrease of 11% compared to the previous week. These data largely overlap with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates high circulation of the influenza virus, followed by SARS-CoV-2, rhinovirus and RSV. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 1 to 7 January 2024 (week 1), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals reported by laboratories dropped to 52 cases, compared with 77 the previous week, presenting an increase of 32%. The peak of the epidemic this season was reached in week 50, from 11 to 17 December 2023.

In a statement, the ministry says the surveillance committee has reported that during the period December 25, 2023, to January 6, 2024, there was a notable increase in the Influenza A - H1NI (swine flu) cases in SVG with 32 laboratory-confirmed cases. As of January 6, 2024, there was a total of 9,804 confirmed cases of SARS-COV2 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) since the outbreak in 2021, of which 243 cases were confirmed in 2023, with two reported so far in 2024. Related Article Caribbean NewsPAHO recommends surveillance of respiratory viruses in Region The ministry notes Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 are highly contagious viral infections of the respiratory tract that can cause severe illness with life-threatening complications, typically affecting people of all ages and can spread when an infected person coughs and or sneezes. Some symptoms are: • high fever (38°C or more) • dry cough • sore throat • body aches and fatigue. Other symptoms include chills, aches behind the eyes, loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhea. Meanwhile, in 2023, SVG recorded 17 cases of Dengue Fever and 20 cases of Leptospirosis. The ministry says these vector-borne diseases did not exceed the normal levels and do not constitute an outbreak. Dengue Fever is a mosquito-borne viral illness that is caused by the bite of an infected mosquito. Persons are encouraged to seek early care from their health care providers if they are experiencing fever accompanied with nausea, vomiting, rash or aches and pains (eye pain, typically behind the eyes, muscle, joint, or bone pain). Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease, spread through contaminated fluids from rodents such as rats and mongooses, that affect humans and animals. Symptoms associated with Leptospirosis include, high fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, vomiting, jaundice (yellow skin and eyes), red eyes, abdominal pain, diarrhea and rash. Some infected persons, however, may have no symptoms at all. The Ministry of Health advises anyone experiencing any of these signs and symptoms to seek medical attention from their district healthcare team or their private healthcare provider. Also testing for influenza, COVID-19, Dengue and Leptospirosis are available in St Vincent and the Grenadines. The Ministry says it will continue to monitor closely and update the public accordingly.

Find out how the NFU lobbied for this change. Summary 21 October 2024: Government confirms legislation will be laid on 4 November 2024. 27 August 2024: New government confirms egg producers and packers will no longer need to change how eggs are labelled during an outbreak of avian influenza. 29 July 2024: The Welsh Government has launched a consultation on removing the 16-week grace period for free range eggs, and removing the 12-week grace period for free range poultry meat. 14 May 2024: At the Farm to Fork Summit, the government announced it will remove the 16-week derogation period for the labelling of free-range eggs produced under AI related housing orders. 9 January 2024: Defra opens consultation on removing the 16-week derogation period in egg marketing standards legislation in England and Scotland. This regulatory change has been one of the NFU’s four key asks for AI (avian influenza) policy, which were first called for in October 2022 alongside asks on AI compensation and long-term strategy including access to insurance and vaccination. 21 October 2024 Legislation to be laid ahead of the New Year As part of a range of measures announced to provide certainty to poultry businesses, the government confirmed that legislation to bring in new egg labelling requirements will be laid on 4 November 2024. It is expected to take effect in January 2025. The changes will mean that free-range eggs can continue to be labelled as such throughout mandatory avian influenza housing measures. NFU poultry board chair James Mottershead said: “We have previously welcomed the government’s announcement to amend existing legislation which will change the free-range egg labelling requirements in England when mandatory avian influenza housing measures are implemented. “With an implementation date now announced it means that by the new year any additional burden for egg producers will be minimised including practical challenges and excess costs. Alignment across GB policy is crucial “The NFU has consistently called for a GB aligned policy on this issue and we urge the Welsh Government to share the outcome of its recent consultation as soon as possible to ensure that the new rules apply to all farmers resulting in a more level playing field with European producers. “We also support the government proposals to bring in similar measures for the labelling of free-range poultry meat and we will respond to the recently launched consultation. “These moves will be welcomed by the sector as they ensure that poultry producers are not left at a competitive disadvantage.” 27 August 2024 Amends to free range egg labelling requirements during AI outbreaks confirmed The new government has today confirmed the amends to the existing legislation will be introduced through a statutory instrument later this year, allowing free range eggs to be labelled as such throughout mandatory housing measures. Responding to the news, NFU Poultry Board chair James Mottershead said: “I’m very pleased to see that the government is making amendments to existing legislation which will change the free-range egg labelling requirements when mandatory avian influenza housing measures are implemented. “The removal of the 16-week derogation period has been one of the NFU’s four key asks for avian influenza policy since October 2022 and therefore it’s great to see that, during stressful times for poultry producers, any additional burden will now be minimised. This includes practical challenges and the excess costs associated with the previously required labelling changes. “This move will be welcomed by producers and we hope to receive a further positive announcement for producers in Wales shortly, following the completion of the ongoing consultation with the Welsh Government. Our overall aim for alignment across GB policy on this issue is crucial to ensure that producers are not left at a competitive disadvantage.” Amends to free range egg labelling requirements during AI outbreaks confirmed 28 August 202428 August 2024 29 July 2024 Welsh government launches consultation Following significant lobbying from the NFU and NFU Cymru, the Welsh Government has launched a consultation on removing the 16-week grace period for free range eggs, and removing the 12-week grace period for free range poultry meat. The proposed changes would allow free range eggs and poultry meat to be labelled as such for the full duration of mandatory Avian Influenza housing measures. The consultation runs for six weeks and will close on 9 September 2024. NFU members are encouraged to respond to the consultation at: GOV.WALES | Free range egg and poultry meat marketing standards. The survey should take around 10 minutes to complete. Lobbying effort Following consultation with industry, Defra and the Scottish Government have already announced a removal of the 16-week free range grace period for eggs produced in England or Scotland. The changes proposed by the Welsh Government would bring egg marketing regulations in line with this. NFU chief poultry adviser Aimee Mahony welcomed the news: “Earlier this year Defra committed to removing the 16-week grace period for free range status, allowing eggs to be labelled as free range during mandatory avian influenza housing measures in England and Scotland. “This commitment was made following significant lobbying from the NFU. However, our ask has always been for amendments to the egg marketing regulations to apply across GB. “Therefore, we were disappointed at the lack of Welsh Government involvement but we are now pleased to hear that our continued lobbying has been fruitful as the Welsh Government has launched a consultation on both egg and poultry meat marketing regulations. “It is important for the devolved governments to be aligned on this issue due to the national operation of poultry supply chains and we will continue to feed in members’ views to the government on this issue.” 14 May 2024 Government agree to remove 16-week derogation period At the 2024 Farm to Fork Summit at 10 Downing Street, the government announced that it will remove the 16-week derogation period for the labelling of free-range eggs produced by hens that are under mandatory housing orders due to avian influenza. This will mean that producers will no longer need to change how eggs are labelled during housing orders, saving farmers from costly labelling requirements. 5 March 2024 Consultation closes This consultation has now closed. 5 March 2024 NFU submits its response The NFU welcomes Defra and the Scottish Government’s proposal to remove the 16-week grace period for free range status which would allow eggs to be labelled as free range for the duration of any mandatory avian housing measures in England and Scotland. The NFU strongly supports the proposed legislative change, but is disappointed that the Welsh Government has not joined with Defra and the Scottish Government in consulting on these proposals. The NFU is urging Defra to work with the devolved administrations to implement the changes across the whole of Great Britain as soon as possible to provide much needed certainty and improve producer confidence in the free-range egg sector. The proposed change would also bring domestic legislation in line with marketing regulations in the European Union, ensuring a more level playing field with European egg producers. Northern Ireland’s marketing regulations are already aligned with the EU, so these proposed changes would also ensure a level playing field within the UK. Protection for producers It is the NFU’s view that housing measures should be evidence-led and introduced as soon as Defra’s veterinary risk assessments indicate that housing is needed to protect poultry and captive birds. Adopting the proposed changes to legislation will create better alignment between avian disease control strategy and marketing regulations. This will allow for more streamlined decision making when introducing and lifting mandatory housing measures in the future. Under the current legislation, egg producers hold the majority of the risk associated with the loss of free range status after the current 16-week period expires and they are dependent on the goodwill of their customers to maintain their free range premium if eggs have to be re-classified as barn eggs. The difference in cost of production in typical commercial free range systems during temporary housing measures compared to when birds have range access is negligible. Therefore, any loss of income associated with the current legislation would impact on the profitability and viability of egg producers. This has an impact on producer confidence and is not a long-term solution, which is why the NFU welcomes Defra’s proposal to remove the 16-week grace period. 9 January 2024 Defra launches consultation Defra and the Scottish Government are proposing to remove the 16 week free range grace period for eggs produced in England or Scotland, allowing eggs to be labelled as free-range instead of barn when laying poultry are housed throughout the duration of mandatory AI housing measures. Marketing standards are a devolved issue and as it stands the Welsh Government has not announced a consultation on an equivalent proposal that would apply in Wales. On the launch of the consultation, NFU Poultry Board chair James Mottershead said: “Poultry farmers put the health and welfare of their birds first. This is why, just like any poultry keeper, they must bring their flocks indoors when government-imposed housing measures are put in place. “However, this can come with additional requirements for egg producers, especially if they must change their packaging. “This consultation provides an opportunity to remove any unnecessary burden on egg producers in England and Scotland enabling a level playing field with poultry producers in the EU. “However, many businesses operate nationally across Great Britain, so it’s critical that eggs produced in Wales are also included in any changes to marketing regulations.” Commenting on the consultation, Farming Minister Mark Spencer said: “We understand the pressures bird flu outbreaks place on our poultry and egg producers, which is why we continue to prioritise ways to support the industry during outbreaks of this disease.” “I encourage all those with an interest to take part in this consultation to ensure that our free-range industry continues to thrive in years to come.” The consultation opened on the 9 January 2024 runs for eight weeks. NFU members could share their views with the organisation through a feedback survey that was available on this page until 26 February 2024. Members are also encouraged to respond directly to Defra at: Consultation on removing the 16-week derogation period in egg marketing standards legislation in England and Scotland. Defra's survey should take no longer than 10 minutes to complete. 9 January 2024 Background information on egg marketing legislation in the UK Egg marketing standards in the UK require clear production system labelling on the outer surface of egg packs. In certain circumstances, such as mandatory poultry housing measures for avian influenza disease control, there is a grace period that allows eggs produced by laying poultry subject to a government imposed mandatory housing measure to continue to be labelled as free-range for 16 weeks. If housing measures remain in place after this 16 week period has ended, the code stamped on individual eggs as well as the labelling on the outer packaging must be changed to indicate barn instead of free range production. During the 2021/22 and 2022/23 avian influenza outbreaks, mandatory government housing measures for poultry exceeded the 16 week grace period, with subsequent changes applicable to labelling in order to comply with marketing standards. This caused additional cost, resource and disruption to egg businesses operating in the UK. More information: Avian influenza and 'free range' status – what does the law say? Legislation in the EU The EU has already amended their egg marketing regulations to remove the 16 week grace period and allow eggs to be marketed as free range for the duration of any mandatory housing measures. Under the current arrangements between the UK and EU, this change also applies to Northern Ireland. Therefore, as it stands, egg producers in GB could be at a competitive disadvantage to EU and NI producers if any future government-imposed housing measures exceed 16 weeks. Proposals and NFU position The changes proposed by Defra and the Scottish Government (which would apply in England and Scotland) would eliminate the administrative burden and cost to the supply chain associated with adopting a labelling solution that complies with marketing regulations after the 16 week grace period expires. Removal of the 16 week grace period would also ensure a level playing field between egg producers in England and Scotland and those in the EU and NI. The NFU ask has always been for amendments to the egg marketing regulations to apply across GB and we are disappointed at the absence of Welsh Government involvement in this consultation. We continue to raise the importance of a GB approach with Welsh officials and will be including reference to this in the NFU response to the consultation.

The people “who lost their lives lately were almost entirely unvaccinated”, said Health Minister Adonis Georgiadis during a press conference in Athens. Out of 1,028 deaths linked to Covid-19 reported since September 2023 across the country, only two were vaccinated, Xinhua news agency quoted data from the Health Ministry. Of the 90 patients currently hospitalised in intensive care units, only two are vaccinated, the data revealed. The health system in Greece was still not under significant pressure from hospitalisations. Therefore, the Ministry has opted to stay with a strong suggestion for the use of protective facemasks mainly in hospitals and not proceed to an announcement of mandatory use of masks or other measures, like the ones introduced recently in other European countries, officials said. In a country of some 10 million people, only 210,000 have received the latest dose of the vaccine against Covid since autumn 2023, and 2.9 million citizens have been vaccinated so far against the flu down from 3.4 million last year. Since November last year, Greece has recorded a gradual rise in Covid-19 cases, unseen since the summer of 2022, and a further increase was expected in the coming days, according to ministry experts, due to contamination during the Christmas and New Year’s holidays gatherings. Greece has reported a total of 6,101,379 Covid-19 cases since the pandemic first erupted in early 2020, with 37,869 deaths.
