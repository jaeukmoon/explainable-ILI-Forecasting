- Influenza viruses are a major public health problem and vaccines are the best countermeasure to induce effective immunity against infection.
- The breadth of antibody responses in infection versus vaccination is quite different.
- Nasal infection controls two sequential processes to induce neutralizing IgG antibodies: viral replication in the lung and the germinal center (GC) response.
- IL-4 derived from follicular helper T cells has an essential role in the expansion of rare GC-B cells recognizing shared epitopes and promoting the generation of broadly-protective antibodies.
- Exposure to shared epitopes and efficient proliferation of GC-B cells are critical for generating broadly-protective antibodies.
- Understanding these mechanisms can provide insights into promoting broad protection from virus infection.
