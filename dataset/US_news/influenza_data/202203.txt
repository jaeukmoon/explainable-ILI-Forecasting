The Common buzzard (Buteo buteo) has a considerable chance of acquiring the infection and therefore may function as bio-sentinel for the presence of virus in wildlife. This study aimed to determine the virus distribution and associated pathological changes in the tissues of Common buzzards that died with HPAI H5 virus infection during the 2020–2021 epizootic. Eleven freshly dead, HPAI H5 virus-positive Common buzzards were necropsied. Based on RT-PCR, all birds were systemically infected with HPAI H5N8 virus, as viral RNA was detected in cloacal and pharyngeal swabs and in all 10 selected tissues of the birds, with mean Ct values per tissue ranging from 22 for heart to 32 for jejunum. Based on histology and immunohistochemistry, the most common virus-associated pathological changes were necrotizing encephalitis (9/11 birds) and necrotizing myocarditis (7/11 birds). The proventriculus of two birds showed virus-associated necrosis, indicating tropism of this virus for the digestive tract. Our advice is to collect at least a miniset of samples including brain, heart, liver, and spleen, as these tissues were positive both by RT-PCR and for virus-antigen-associated lesions.

The 2020–2021 epizootic of HPAI H5 virus in Europe was the biggest on record in both wild birds and poultry. Based on the animal disease notification system of the affected countries, over 1000 detections of HPAI H5 virus were reported in wild birds4. The subtype H5N8 was the first and most widespread genotype circulating during the first months of the epizootic (i.e., October–November 2020)3,4. Nevertheless, the virus reassorted multiple times, so that sixteen distinct genotypes co-circulated. Early surveillance showed that the first incursions in Europe of the HPAI H5N8 virus occurred in the fall of 2020; however, the epizootic season extended into winter–spring–summer of 2021, with the outbreaks mainly clustered in two peaks: in November 2020 and March 20214. The highest number of detections in wild birds occurred in waterfowl species (order Anseriformes). The second highest number of detections occurred in raptors (orders Accipitriformes, Strigiformes, and Falconiformes); nine different raptor species were found positive, and Common buzzard (Buteo buteo, order Accipitriformes) accounted for the highest number of detections in raptors4. These birds are infected predominantly by ingesting infected prey. Medium-sized raptor species like the Common buzzard, that can hunt and feed on sizeable birds and ingest a high quantity of infected meat, are considered to be at high risk of becoming infected with HPAIV, and to die of related disease10,11. In this context, the investigation of Common buzzard mortality for HPAI virus could be used in addition to waterfowl mortality as a passive-surveillance system for early warning and duration of the presence of the virus in wild bird populations.Wild raptors also have been affected by severe HPAI disease during earlier HPAIV epizootics7,8,9,10,11,12,15. Studies on those birds showed that HPAI viruses in wild raptors are primarily neurotropic, and that infected raptors usually present with neurologic signs due to encephalitis, often resulting in death8,10,15. The condition of some of the carcasses in those reports was suboptimal due to a combination of autolysis, scavenging and freezing, all factors that may impede detailed pathological assessment, in particular identification of specific cell types and evaluation of autolysis-prone tissues such as enteric epithelium.Despite the high number of reported infected Common buzzards, we are not aware of any studies on the pathogenesis of infection with recent HPAI H5 viruses in this species. This is particularly relevant because, since the 2005–2006 HPAI H5N1 outbreak, HPAI H5 viruses have evolved rapidly and currently are thought to persist longer in wild bird populations1,2,3,4,5,6. Updated knowledge of the virology and pathology of infections with more recently circulating viruses is necessary in order to better understand the current pathogenesis of HPAI in Common buzzards; to provide updated guidance regarding the key tissues to collect for HPAI diagnosis at autopsies; and to compare the presence of virus in cloacal and pharyngeal swabs, routinely tested for HPAIV surveillance, with the presence of virus in the main tissues.To determine the virus distribution and associated pathological changes in the tissues of Common buzzards that died with HPAI H5 virus infection in the Netherlands during the 2020–2021 HPAI epizootic, a collaboration was established among citizen scientists, animal organizations and researchers, aiming to retrieve and examine freshly dead Common buzzards. Eleven Common buzzards were examined and necropsied. All the birds tested positive for HP H5N8. This study documents the virological and pathological findings associated with 2020–2021 HPAI H5N8 infection in Common buzzards and discusses its implications.ResultsSerologyAll birds tested negative for antibodies against avian influenza virus NP.VirologyPharyngeal and cloacal swabs were positive for HPAI H5N8 virus by RT-PCR, with comparable viral RNA levels in pharyngeal and cloacal swabs (Table 1). Sequencing and molecular characterization of HPAI H5N8 virus, detected in the pharyngeal swab of Common buzzard B9, is publicly accessible (http://www.gisaid.com, A/Common Buzzard/Netherlands/4/2020, isolate EPI_ISL_1575129). Based on virus culture in MDCK-cell culture, three birds in total tested positive in pharyngeal (B9 and B11), and cloacal (B3 and B9) swabs.Table 1 RT-PCR of the influenza A virus matrix gene-fragment results and virus titers in swabs and organs of H5N8-infected wild Common buzzards (Buteo buteo). *Cycle threshold (Ct) value, cut-off value is 40; ** all titers are given in TCID50 log 10; # this value is likely an outlier; n, negative (< 0.5 for virus titers); np, not present.Full size tableAll tissues tested were virus-positive by RT-PCR (Table 1), indicating a systemic spread of the infection (n.b., Ct values give an indication of the viral RNA amount in each tissue). Although their Ct values were relatively close together, the tissues with the higher content of viral RNA were, in descending order: heart, brain, air sac, spleen, and lung; the tissues with the lower content of viral RNA were, in descending order: liver, pancreas, colon, kidney, jejunum.Gross pathologyBirds did not present external lesions, and were in moderate to good state of nutrition. The crop of the birds was empty (an indication that they had not fed at least for 24 h prior death), and four birds had scarce food remains from a recent meat meal in the ventriculus. At internal examination only two birds presented gross abnormalities. When present, the main lesions were multifocal, well-delimited hemorrhages in the heart and in the brain of one bird. The liver of a different bird appeared swollen and with rounded margins. The other organs appeared grossly normal.Histopathology and ImmunohistochemistrySeveral organs, and in particular the brain, heart, liver, and spleen, showed histological lesions that colocalized with moderate to abundant presence of viral antigen (Fig. 1). The brain of 81% (9/11) of the birds showed multifocal encephalitis with foci of gliosis, neuronal degeneration, and necrosis; abundant viral antigen was present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of several neurons. The heart of 63% (7/11) of the birds showed marked, multifocal to focally extensive myocardial necrosis; few myocardial cells presented viral antigen. The liver and the spleen of 54% (6/11) of the birds showed multifocal, mild to moderate hepatocellular and splenic necrosis, respectively; viral antigen was associated with areas of necrosis. The kidneys of 18% (2/11) of the birds showed mild interstitial nephritis, with no presence of viral antigen. The pancreas of 18% (2/11) of the birds showed multifocal necrosis with no presence of viral antigen. The ovary of 18% (2/11) of the birds showed moderate infiltration with mononuclear cells; few epithelial cells presented viral antigen. The proventriculus of 18% (2/11) of the birds showed necrotic lesions; few necrotic cells, most likely epithelial cells, presented viral antigen. Mild to moderate, inflammatory changes and infiltration with mononuclear cells were observed in the nasal passage, trachea, lung, and air sac of 18% (2/11) of the birds; few epithelial cells in these organs presented viral antigen.Figure 1Histopathological changes and influenza virus antigen expression in tissues of HPAI H5N8 virus-infected Common buzzards (Buteo buteo). Tissue sections in the left column are stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Serial tissue sections in the right column are stained for influenza virus antigen by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In all tissues there is necrosis and inflammation associated with virus antigen expression.Full size imageDiscussionThis study describes the virological and pathological findings of Common buzzards infected with the 2020–2021 HPAI H5N8 virus. These analyses showed that the main lesions were HPAI virus-associated inflammation and necrosis in multiple tissues including brain and heart, confirming HPAI as cause of death or severe disease.The Common buzzard presents with several characteristic traits that make it a valuable bioindicator of HPAIV presence in wildlife. It is a medium-sized raptor, present almost throughout Europe. In the Netherlands, its population has been stable since 1970 with an estimated maximum winter population of 30,000–50,000 individuals16. The Common buzzard is mainly a resident bird, which generally inhabits woodlands but is adaptable to wetlands16,17. Its feeding behavior as an opportunistic predator and scavenger has the potential to expose it to HPAIV-infected prey. Given these predisposing biological traits, it is not unexpected that Common buzzards accounted for the highest number of HPAI virus detections in raptors during the 2020–2021 epizootic.Previous studies showed that HPAI viruses in raptors are highly neurotropic and cause severe neurological disease8,10,15,18,19. This study also supports those findings, as the most consistent lesion in Common buzzards was viral encephalitis, with confirmed presence of viral antigen in affected neurons. In addition to the nervous system, all the tissues tested of the Common buzzards were positive for virus based on RT-PCR and showed infection-related, histological lesions, indicating that HPAI H5N8 virus infection in the Common buzzard causes systemic disease.This study showed that HPAI H5N8 virus is also highly cardiotropic, as the myocardium of the Common buzzards contained the highest amount of virus based on RT-PCR (Table 1), and virus-associated, severe histological lesions in 63% (7/11) birds. In addition, 54% (6/11) of the Common buzzards showed virus-associated lesions in the liver and spleen.The Common buzzard is considered to be infected via the oral route by ingesting HPAIV-infected preys. Transmission of HPAIV from ingesting infected chicken meat has been experimentally confirmed in raptors20. Interestingly, the proventriculus of two birds in our study showed necrotic lesions with viral antigen. This finding further supports the oral route of infection, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the proventriculus was infected via the hematogenous route. It also provides new records of HPAIV enterotropism in wild birds. The adaptation to the intestinal tract is a mechanism recently reported for HPAI H5N8 virus, that may allow a more efficient fecal–oral transmission in wild birds5.Real time PCR (RT-PCR) is the preferred test for HPAI virus detection for active and passive bird surveillance9. In this study, cloacal and pharyngeal swabs had comparable RNA-levels, and both were adequate for the detection of the virus. The tissue analysis by RT-PCR showed that heart, brain, and air sac had highest viral RNA concentrations compared to other organs. Although not confirmed by a quantitative real time PCR, the results obtained by RT-PCR are well supported by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Our advice for diagnostic pathologists is to collect at least a miniset of samples including brain, heart, liver and spleen, as these tissues are relatively easily sampled and were positive by both RT-PCR and for virus-antigen-associated lesions. For virus diagnosis of Common buzzards found dead (but without the interest or possibility to perform pathological examination), it is enough to collect pharyngeal and cloacal swabs, because they were positive by RT-PCR with Ct values that were comparable to those in most tissues (with exception of heart, that had higher Ct values).We did not detect antibodies against avian influenza virus NP in the sera of the Common buzzards in this study. Most of the birds (8/11) were juveniles in their first year of life, and likely they did not have protective antibodies from previous infections, as this was the first time in their lives that they experienced a HPAI epizootic. The absence of antibodies indicates also that the Common buzzards died acutely soon after infection, similarly to experimentally infected raptors that did not seroconvert before early death19. All the birds in our study were females. Females are larger than males (adult female weigh about 15% more than adult males), thus it is possible that female raptors are easier to find during surveillance or that there are sex-associated differences in feeding patterns.This study showed that HPAIV infection in Common buzzards produced severe systemic disease, and subsequent acute death based on the stage of the pathological changes and absence of serum antibodies. Cloacal and pharyngeal swabs were comparable in detecting the infection. Many organs contained viral RNA; with heart, brain and air sac containing the highest amount of viral RNA. The proventriculus of two birds showed virus-associated lesions, implying a possible adaptation of the virus to the gastro-intestinal tract.Materials and methodsBirdsIn November 2020, during the first peak of the 2020–2021 HPAIV epizootic, 11 wild Common buzzard carcasses were presented at Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, for pathological and virological investigations. These birds were found by citizen scientists; nine birds were found dead, and two were still alive but subsequentially were euthanized after showing severe neurological signs of disease, such as torticollis and body tremors. The carcasses were refrigerated, and autopsies were performed at Bio Security Level 3 settings within 24 h after retrieval.NecropsyThe birds appeared freshly dead and in good state of preservation. All the birds were female based on the presence of an oviduct and ovaries in the coelomic cavity; eight were juveniles (first year) and three were adults (second year) based on their plumage. Pharyngeal and cloacal swabs were collected for virology from each bird, using sterile cotton swabs placed in 1 ml of virus transport medium. Tissue samples from nasal turbinate, air sac, trachea, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas, stomach, jejunum, duodenum, colon, and brain were collected for virology and kept at -80 °C until analysis. Duplicate samples of the same tissue were collected for histopathology and immunohistochemistry and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin until analysis. Blood from the heart was collected in a plain 2 ml tube, and centrifuged for 15 min at 1500 g.Serology. Sera were tested for nucleoprotein (NP)-specific antibodies with a commercial blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (bELISA) (Idexx A Ab Test ; Idexx Laboratories BV, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands). Samples were tested according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A sample was considered NP positive when the signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., ratio of the mean optical density [ODx] of the sample/ODx of the negative control) was 0.5 or lower.VirologyTissue samples were first weighed and then homogenized with a FastPrep 24 (MP Biomedicals, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) in Hankʾs balanced salt solution and centrifuged briefly before dilution in lysis buffer for RNA extraction10. Extracted total RNA of tissue samples, pharyngeal and cloacal swabs were tested for the presence of influenza A virus matrix gene-fragment; pharyngeal and cloacal swabs were further subtyped using real-time RT-PCR targeting fragments of the H5 and N8 genes. Samples were characterized as HPAI H5 virus by detection of a multi-basic cleavage site upon Sanger sequencing of the HA gene9. Full genome sequence of the virus isolated from the pharyngeal swab of Common buzzard 9 (B9), was obtained by Sanger sequencing. In order to assess the excretion of infectious virus, pharyngeal and cloacal swabs were also tested by virus culture. Virus titers of the pharyngeal and cloacal swabs were obtained with triplicate tenfold serial dilutions in confluent layers of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells10.Histopathology and immunohistochemistryTissues samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 μm, and stained: with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for presence of histopathological changes; with an immunohistochemical test, using monoclonal antibody against nucleoprotein of influenza A virus as a primary antibody, for detection of influenza viral antigen10.

(Photo Credit: Douglas Stutz) VIEW ORIGINAL BREMERTON, Wash. -- It’s the viral “Triple Threat” of respiratory illnesses which public health experts grimly knew could happen. The Omicron variant of the COVID-19 outbreak, along with the annual winter cold and influenza season(s) are making it difficult for a number of people to weather the winter. Officials at Puget Sound Military Health System commands such as Naval Hospital Bremerton, along with Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and Naval Health Clinic Oak Harbor are helping to prevent the pandemic as well as protect patients from the common cold and flu. NHB subject matter experts strongly advocate that everyone should continue to take practical preventive measure to ward off the three highly-infectious viruses. “Since we began administering COVID-19 vaccines on Dec. 23, 2020, that is the best tool we all have to help protect us against COVID-19, slow the transmission of the virus and also reduce the possibility of new emergent variants,” said Dr. Dan Frederick, NHB/NMRTC Bremerton population health officer and public health emergency officer. Frederick also advocates for all those vaccinated to get a booster shot. “Being vaccinated strengthens our immune system against the disease. If someone does get the highly-contagious COVID-19 virus or the flu, any symptoms will be less severe and not result on needing to be admitted for in-patient care,” explained Frederick. The viruses are spread from person to person, especially between those in close contact – six feet or less – with each other. All are shared by droplets that occur when someone with the illness coughs, sneezes, or talks. The droplets spray out and land on someone else and get inhaled into their lungs. A person can also get physically infected by shaking hands, touching a handrail or door knob that has the virus on it and then touching their own nose, eyes or mouth. There are also multiple protective measures which everyone can apply daily to mitigate the potential spread of the viruses, such as hand washing; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; avoid close contact with sick people and maintain social distancing of at least six feet; cover cough/sneezes and discard used tissues and wash hands immediately afterwards; clean/disinfect frequently touched surfaces at least daily and cover your nose and mouth with a face mask when around others. Even for the common cold, of which there is no known cure, the CDC notes people can reduce the risk of getting a cold by hand washing often, for at least 20 seconds with soap and water and avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. With the Omicron variant surging over the last several weeks, it is now the dominant strain of the pandemic in the U.S. It is also causing a rise in COVID cases throughout the Puget Sound MHS and surrounding communities. It’s considered much more transmissible – up to two and three times more likely to spread - than previous variants. In unvaccinated people the most common symptoms are fever, cough, chills and shortness of breath. Those vaccinated may experience milder symptoms such a congestion, runny nose, sore throat and fatigue. If all those symptoms sound like what someone can experience with getting the flu or common cold, they are. Similar symptoms between the three include fever and/or chills, shortness of breath or difficult breathing, fatigue, sore throat, runny/stuffy nose, coughing/sneezing, muscle pain/body ache, headache, and even vomiting/diarrhea. It can take at least one or more days after someone is infected by either virus to begin to experience any of the symptoms just mentioned. Another similarity is all three virus are hidden. They can be spread by someone not knowing they have either one, due to no symptoms apparent, or having mild symptoms, or even never developing symptoms. Those who are at high risk - such as older adults, people with underlying medical conditions and those who are pregnant - can become severely sick by either and possibly deal with a host of complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and the worsening of chronic medical conditions. All DoD personnel are being encouraged to receive the booster dose for further protection of themselves as well as those around them. All those 18 and older who have already received the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine series six months previous and those who received their Johnson and Johnson dose at least two months ago are booster eligible. NHB is also providing flu vaccinations to all eligible beneficiaries at the Immunization Clinic. During the seasonal influenza campaign shot exercise held Oct. 4-10, 2021, approximately 2,370 flu shots were administered. “As we do every year, we strongly encourage everyone to get the flu vaccine. It’s now more important than ever due to the ongoing pandemic,” said Frederick, echoing CDC concerns. “It is especially important for pregnant women and people with chronic diseases like asthma and diabetes, and those that have weakened immune systems.” NHB adheres to CDC advice that everyone - even those as young as six months - should get the influenza vaccine each year. Influenza viruses cause mild to severe illness, whereas COVID-19 has caused serious illness in many, resulting in over 832,000 deaths in the U.S. alone. The CDC notes that most people get colds in the winter and recover in 7-10 days. However, people with weakened immune systems, asthma, or conditions that affect the lungs and breathing passages may develop serious illness, such as pneumonia. Common colds also continue to be a main reason for children to miss school and adults miss work. Frederick, attests that immunization is the primary method of reducing seasonal influenza illness, along with helping to eliminate the pandemic. “The COVID-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination not only helps protect vaccinated individuals, but also helps protect entire communities by preventing and reducing the spread of the disease,” added Frederick.

Why experts hope we can transition COVID-19 into an endemic era Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Print Back to Each Breath Blog Each Breath Blog Back to Each Breath Blog by Editorial Staff | January 21, 2022 Topics: COVID-19 Lung Health & Procedures As we head into the third year of dealing with COVID-19, experts seem to agree that the virus that has been dominating our lives isn’t going away any time soon. But that doesn’t mean that we will be living through a pandemic forever. The hope is that advances like COVID-19 vaccines and new treatment options will help us move into a new state, an endemic state. But what is the difference between these two states of disease spread and what does this change mean for our lives? Sign up for email Get the latest news in lung health directly to your inbox. Many experts say that COVID will likely lose its “pandemic” status sometime in 2022, due largely to rising global vaccination rates the widespread, less lethal, infection with the Omicron variant. “If the virus does become more seasonal, wearing a mask on public transit and indoors during COVID season could become the new normal and other familiar prevention strategies, like regularly washing your hands and maintaining distancing practices in high-risk settings, could also stick around during seasonal spikes,” said Dr. Albert Rizzo, Chief Medical Officer of the American Lung Association.Epidemic vs PandemicAn outbreak is a sudden rise in the number of cases of a disease more than normal expectancy in a community or geographical area. An outbreak can be declared an epidemic when the disease spreads rapidly to many people.In December of 2019, the news was full of reports of an epidemic in Wuhan, China. Similar to an outbreak, an epidemic is defined by being contained in a small population, but the number of cases is larger than normally expected. Other examples of epidemics in our modern world include yellow fever, smallpox, and West Nile. Epidemics can also describe things that aren’t contagious like teen vaping or obesity.Many epidemics can be contained and do not spread worldwide. But this was not the case for SARS-CoV-2, a virus which quickly became more widespread, with cases present worldwide. The number of people affected was exponentially growing and the World Health Organization (WHO) upgraded COVID-19 to a pandemic in March 2020.Pandemics are known to cause large-scale social disruption, economic loss, and general hardship, and COVID-19 has been no exception. Early on, people found themselves quarantined in their homes for long periods of time, isolated from friends and loved ones until experts could find a way to control the spread of the infection. Pandemic vs EndemicThe availability of the COVID-19 vaccine was a key step toward ending the pandemic or transitioning into an endemic. Enough people need to have immune protection from the virus for it to become endemic, highlighting the importance of vaccination. Though an endemic is a constant presence in a community, it differs from a pandemic because the virus is somewhat contained and not spreading out of control and not stressing the health care infrastructure, therefore we can more easily prevent and treat it. For example, the flu is a common endemic virus for which there are treatment options and a yearly vaccine. However, there can be outbreaks of flu that can lead to an epidemic, with the potential to occasionally become a pandemic as was seen with the H1N1 flu pandemic of 2009. Other Respiratory Pandemics The Flu of 1918TuberculosisH1N1 Flu of 2009 So, though SARS-CoV-2 may never go away, experts want to understand it so that we can return to our normal ways of living. By creating a vaccine and finding effective treatment options, the goal is for COVID-19 to be less deadly and destructive. Mutating variants of the COVID-19 virus have unfortunately delayed this transition. There are many who believe Omicron is the final wave of the pandemic. That thought is based on the feeling that there will be so much immunity in many populations due to the overwhelmingly easy spread of the Omicron variant that transmission rates will drop, and SARS-2 will transition into something more akin to the influenza-like illnesses that sicken people during the winter months but are far less disruptive than the pandemic has been. If transmission slows, hopefully so too will the virus’s accumulation of mutations that could avoid our treatments or immune protection.How COVID-19 Can Become EndemicEarlier in the pandemic, many experts agreed that the goal was to reach herd immunity, which is when enough of the population has been vaccinated or recovered from the infection that a resistance is built up, thus slowing the spread of the virus. However, now that we better understand how the virus mutates and spreads, and immunity wanes over time, eradication has proven unlikely.But according to Dr. Fauci, that is not the goal. He told Reuters in November, “To me, you want to get to endemic (…) People will still get infected. People might still get hospitalized, but the level would be so low that we don't think about it all the time and it doesn't influence what we do."A key step is getting as much of the population to receive the recommended COVID-19 vaccine and boosters as possible. The availability of new treatment options, such as monoclonal antibody or antiviral treatments, are also poised to move us in the right direction. Until then, keeping masks on and maintaining social distance and hygiene practices is the best way to help us one day move into this new endemic state.Read More about COVID-19 Treatment and Prevention on our site.

Last updated on 15-Nov-2022 at 10:58 GMT Facebook Twitter Linkedin Email to a friend ©iStock Results from a review and meta-analysis on the effects tea catechins on influenza and other upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) reveals “significant preventative effects.” Researchers reviewed six random control trials (RCTs) and four prospective cohort studies to evaluate the evidence supporting the effectiveness of tea gargling and tea catechin consumption in preventing viral respiratory infections.They explain that catechins (or flavanols) present in green tea inhibit the proliferation of viruses in the upper respiratory tract (URT) by forming a protective barrier in the pharynx.On flavanol in particular, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), has a direct anti-viral effect and physically binds to and flushes out viruses in the URT.“EGCg and epigallocatechin (EGC) bind to the hemagglutinin spike on the viral surface and neuraminidase to inhibit attachment of the virus to the cell surface, thereby preventing influenza infection,” ​the research team states.​“Given the evidence that EGCg, a main component of tea catechins, provides effective protection against influenza virus and adenovirus, it may also protect against respiratory infections caused by other viruses.”​Natural interventions​Interest in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that may slow or prevent the spread of infectious disease has increased due to recent pandemics involving influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and COVID-19.Measures that can reduce their impact and severity in the early stages is deemed key in the fight against infection.There is considerable research on the efficacy of NPIs, such as hand washing, wearing masks and physical distancing, in reducing the transmission of respiratory infections have been performed, but limited documentary proof supporting the effectiveness of tea gargling and tea catechin, therefore the efficacy of the intervention is “not well accepted​”.One study reviewed by the team demonstrated consumption of catechin capsules reduced the incidence of influenza-like symptoms by 32.1%, and another noted “strong effects​” following consumption of large amounts of catechins per day.Study protocol​Review literature was sourced from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Ichushi Web databases. Study material was evaluated for risk of bias and the quality assessed independently.The cohorts from the four studies were selected from populations with a custom of gurgling black tea and green tea, consumption of black tea and green tea, and those who consumed Goishi tea, a local type of green tea produced in the Kochi prefecture in Japan.Interventions in the RCTs included data from 3,748 subjections and consumption of either green tea extracts (catechin solution for two RCTs, and catechin-containing capsules for two RCTs) or bottled green tea (two RCTs), with placebo (four RCTs) or water (two RCTs) as the control group.Five of the RCTs were conducted in Japan and one in the US.Review findings​Preventive effects identified in the present study likely derive from the effects of tea or tea catechins, the authors say. Furthermore, some of the studies provided clear descriptions regarding the amounts of tea catechin consumed, which allowed them to conduct a meta-analysis on the dose-dependency of the catechin effect. This revealed a significant correlation between the risk ratio and the total daily amount of catechins consumed.“Specifically, the larger the amount of daily catechin consumption, the stronger the preventive effect against the spread of viral respiratory infection. Furthermore, as reported by Furushima et al., drinking a tea catechin-containing drink three times a day (high-catechin group) had a stronger preventive effect than drinking it once a day.”​Review findings are consistent with previous meta-analysis and confirm the robustness of the study. They suggest tea gargling and tea catechin consumption presents a relatively easy and effective way to inhibit the spread of viral respiratory infections.The authors conclude that: “Incorporating tea catechin consumption and/or tea gargling into the daily routine may be effective NPIs for preventing viral respiratory infections”.​Source: European Journal of Nutrition​Published online: doi.org/10.1007/s00394-021-02681-2​​‘Preventive effects of tea and tea catechins against influenza and acute upper respiratory tract infections: a systematic review and meta‑analysis’​Mai Umeda, Takeichiro Tominaga, Kazuya Kozuma, Hidefumi Kitazawa, Daisuke Furushima, Masanobu Hibi, Hiroshi Yamada Copyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are © 2024 - William Reed Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions Related topics Research Botanicals Respiratory health Inflammation Related news Show more Cocoa flavanols decrease blood pressure only when elevated, researchers find Cambridge Commodities launches naturally sourced L-theanine Green tea extracts may promote oxidative stress, suggests researchers Polyphenol blend may be able to reduce blood pressure, according to study Show more Related products show more 03 Dec 2024 Tuesday Nutraceutical market trends for 2025: Insights by PharmaLinea and Euromonitor PharmaLinea Ltd. | Webinar We will examine how supplements developed in 2024 and indicate what trends can be expected in the future.

Its efforts include launching a nationwide mobile text message campaign on Boxing Day.Bancel has previously said that people may need a fourth shot of a vaccine this autumn as protection from booster shots declines over the coming months.This month, Israel became the first country in the world to offer a fourth dose of the coronavirus vaccine to people aged 60 and over.The US president’s chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, also speaking at Davos on Monday, said there was no evidence that repeat booster disease would overwhelm the immune system.“Giving boosters at different times, there is really no evidence that’s going to hinder” immune response, he said.Fauci said the goal should be a booster that induces a response against multiple potential variants.Bancel also said Moderna’s vaccine candidate specifically targeting the Omicron variant of coronavirus has almost finished being developed and will enter clinical development imminently. The US drug company expects to be able to share data with regulatory authorities around March, he added.Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk“The vaccine is being finished,” he said. “It should be in the clinic in the coming weeks. We are hoping in the March timeframe to be able to have data to share with regulators to figure out next steps.”This month, Darius Hughes, the UK chief executive of Moderna, said it would be a “stretch” for a combined flu and Covid vaccine to be available by winter 2023.“Our number one priority for 2022, after getting the right Covid vaccine for the Omicron variant, is to try to really drive forward our flu and RSV programmes to see if we can get a combination, single-dose respiratory vaccine,” he said. “The benefit for the NHS, and all the vaccination services, and ultimately patients, we think, is going to be huge.”Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryCoronavirusMedical researchFlunewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyBoris Johnson: we considered ‘aquatic raid’ on Netherlands to seize Covid vaccine27 Sept 2024Economically inactive Britons with long Covid have ‘doubled’ in a year4 Aug 2022Taxpayers left with £421m bill after one in 12 firms default on Covid loans28 Jul 2022Communicate risks of not getting Covid vaccine to boost uptake, study suggests28 Aug 2024AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine is no more – but its remarkable success must not be forgotten11 May 2024Rise of Omicron subvariants sends UK staff absence soaring28 Jul 2022Wimbledon receives most support under Covid events insurance scheme5 Jul 2022AstraZeneca withdraws Covid-19 vaccine worldwide, citing surplus of newer vaccines8 May 2024Scientists create vaccine with potential to protect against future coronaviruses6 May 2024British taxpayers take stake in sex party planning firm Killing Kittens27 Jun 2022Most viewedMost viewedBusinessEconomicsBankingMoneyMarketsProject SyndicateB2BRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Study: Viral Interference between Respiratory Viruses. Image Credit: Rost9 / Shutterstock.com Background Virus-virus interactions occur when different respiratory viruses concurrently infect the respiratory tract and subsequently lead to either a synergistic or antagonistic effect on replication or infection of the viruses. Many studies have evaluated the mechanisms of viral interferences in animal models susceptible to the respiratory viruses of interest and differentiated airway epithelial cells. One such mechanism is interferon (IFN)-mediated temporary non-specific immunity in the host. An increase in disease severity or pathogenesis of viruses is associated with a positive virus-virus interaction. Negative virus interactions depend upon whether the viruses belong to the same or different family. In the case of homologous virus interactions, cross-reactivity from the first virus inhibits the growth of the second. In heterologous interactions, the induction of non-specific innate immunity by the first virus prevents or reduces the infection associated with the second virus. Viral interference In the 1960s, a research group described the concept of viral interference by developing live enterovirus vaccines (LEVs) to prevent various enteric diseases, such as polioviruses. Apart from the protection these vaccines offer against pathogenic enteroviruses, oral administration of LEVs in children lowered the detection of several unrelated viruses such as human adenovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza, which may be due to viral interference caused by LEV-induced IFN. Similarly, a study conducted between 1968–1971 demonstrated possible LEV-associated protection against acute viral respiratory infections. However, these findings received backlash due to some rare incidences of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis and vaccine-derived poliovirus during that period. Diagram showing how components of RNA viruses are recognized by TLRs located at the plasma membrane (TLR4, viral glycoprotein sensing) and in the endosomal compartment (TLR3, double-stranded RNA sensing; TLR7 and TLR8, both single-stranded RNA sensing). Virus replication intermediates and replicated genomes are also recognized by cytosolic RNA sensors, RIG-I, and MDA5. Downstream adaptor proteins, MyD88 for TLR4, TLR7, and TLR8; TRIF for TLR3 and TLR4, and MAVS (for MDA5 and RIG-I) are activated. These activations trigger signaling cascades through TRAF3 and TRAF6; TBK1; and IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKε, which leads to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, IRF3, and IRF7. These changes result in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I and type III IFNs. Secreted IFN-α/β and IFN-λ bind to their specific receptors (IFNAR and IFNLR) in infected and neighboring cells. Activation of JAK-1 and TYK-2 leads to phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. After translocation in the nucleus, phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 form a complex with IRF9 to induce expression of ISGs, such as OAS-RNase L and PKR, and establishment of an antiviral program.

Interferences between respiratory viruses Several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated potential viral interferences at the host level.

During the sequential and mixed outbreak of the influenza virus in Japan in the 1977–78 winter season, it was observed that antibody generation in the sequential and viral interference in the mixed outbreaks was responsible for the cross-subtype protection. One study conducted in ferrets investigating the potential viral interference between influenza virus types pH1N1 and influenza B virus (IBV) subtypes pH1N1 and H3N2 indicated a viral interference when the primary and secondary infections occur within three to seven days. Further, pH1N1 virus infection in ferrets prevented a subsequent infection with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for about seven days. Following a primary RSV infection, low morbidity was associated with secondary pH1N1 viral infection, though all ferrets were co-infected. Although pH1N1 viral infection generated more chemokines, cytokines, and immune mediators as compared to RSV in the respiratory tract, both infections generated a low amount of cross-reactive IFN-γ-producing cells. These findings suggested an innate immunity-based interference between IAV and RSV. The differentiated human lung epithelial cells pre-infected with RSV reduced the likelihood of a subsequent human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection, whereas the reverse effect was not observed. This viral interference was associated with IFN-α, IFN-λ, IFN-I, and IFN-III. The differentiated human airway epithelial cells pre-infected with human rhinovirus (HRV) conferred significant protection against successive pH1N1 or IAV infections for about three days by inducing interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) and inhibiting IFN signaling pathways with BX795. In mouse models, HRV was less potent in preventing IAV infection concomitantly; however, two days before the HRV inoculation, lowered morbidity and mortality was associated with IAV through an early controlled pulmonary inflammatory response. Children with prior exposure to RSV had a lower incidence of HRV than those without a previous RSV infection. However, those who were co-infected showed an increase in disease severity as compared to a single RSV infection. Furthermore, infants who received palivizumab for immunoprophylaxis against RSV had a higher incidence of HRV as compared to those without this medication history. Influenza virus, HRV, and SARS-CoV-2 Although the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) generates a broader range of ISGs, chemokines, and cytokines in the human nasal mucosa than the pH1N1 virus, an early IFN-I and IFN-III response in human lung tissues were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the influenza virus. Thus, the virus-virus interaction depends upon the initial virus causing the infection. Studies with golden Syrian hamsters have indicated that an initial pH1N1 infection reduced the lower pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 load if the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs after a day. However, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection did not affect the pH1N1 load in the lungs as compared to a single pH1N1 infection. Co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and pH1N1 viruses led to an increase in disease severity and lung inflammatory damage when compared to the effect of single infections. One limitation of this study was the insufficient time between viral infections to develop an interference. During the influenza viral infection in ferrets, a non-specific innate immunity was elicited by them after two to three days, during which the second virus was inoculated also. Hence, more studies are required to understand SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus interactions. Despite the mitigation measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, HRV remained prevalent throughout the period. Since HRV is a nonenveloped virus, it is resistant to sanitizing, and the use of face masks does not prevent transmission of HRV. Studies have demonstrated that human bronchial epithelial cells previously infected with HRV impaired SARS-CoV-2 replication by inducing several ISGs, whereas the opposite is not true. However, BX795-mediated inhibition of ISG induction will overcome HRV interference and lead to a higher SARS-CoV-2 replication rate. Defective viral genomes Defective viral genomes (DVGs) synthesized during the replication of ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses play a significant role in viral adaptation, host immune escape, and persistence. DVGs can inhibit cytopathic effects produced by a wild-type virus. Moreover, by competing with viral genomes for packaging or replication, DVGs mediate homologous viral interference and, through the production of IFN-I and IFN-III, heterologous interference. Hence, DVGs have been used as therapeutic agents against respiratory virus infections. Conclusions Once the sanitary restrictions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic are lifted, other respiratory virus interactions with SARS-CoV-2 can be estimated. In the case of closely spaced co-exposures of viruses sharing similar ecological conditions, the initial viral infection might induce a refractory period. During this time, there are lower chances of subsequent respiratory virus infection in the host. Factors influencing viral interferences include the rapid induction of IFN by the interfering virus, the extent of susceptibility of the second virus towards immune mediators and different viruses' ability to counteract IFN induction, as well as the degree of innate immunity activated in the respiratory tract by each virus. Viral interference at the population level is difficult to demonstrate since there are differences in the transmission dynamics of the respiratory viruses according to social behaviors and the time of year among various age groups. Prospective epidemiologic studies can demonstrate viral interference by assessing multiple respiratory viruses in serial nasopharyngeal swab specimens of subjects from various epidemic periods. The interaction between respiratory viruses causing different epidemic peaks should be evaluated for their chances of co-detection and mechanisms using in vivo and ex vivo models.

January 18, 2022 By Gillian Rutherford Matthias Götte led new research showing for the first time why the antiviral drug remdesivir is effective against some viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, but not against others — which will help develop broad-spectrum treatments against both existing and new viruses. (Photo: John Ulan) Understanding exactly how antiviral drugs interact with viruses at a molecular level will be key to developing the broad-spectrum therapies needed to battle against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and get ready to fight the next one, according to a newly published paper in the The Journal of Biological Chemistry. The paper reveals the inner workings of the drug remdesivir against different families of viruses. Remdesivir has been given to more than nine million COVID-19 patients worldwide, and is so far the only small-molecule antiviral drug that has Health Canada approval to treat the disease. “The findings of studies such as this one help us understand the molecular basis of antiviral activity, and thus facilitate the development of oral antivirals with a broad spectrum of activity,” said lead author Matthias Götte, professor and chair of the Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Alberta. Until now it was not understood why remdesivir works in lab tests against some viruses including coronaviruses, Ebola, hepatitis C and Nipah virus, but not against others such as influenza and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. “We found that certain biochemical parameters are extremely important,” said Götte, noting that it all comes down to how well the drug tricks the polymerase, which is the replication engine of the virus and the target of remdesivir. “Remdesivir is very well incorporated by the polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 and not so well by other viruses where it does not work,” he said, adding that once it is incorporated, the drug inhibits all viral polymerases tested in the study. More than one drug needed Now that the interactions between remdesivir and several other viruses are better understood, the next step will be to modify the compound to be better accepted by the polymerase of a broader range of other viruses. “What we would like to have when the next pandemic strikes — and it's not a question of if, it's a question of when — what we need to have on the first day is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent,” Götte said. Another key to successful antivirals is timing. Clinical trials have shown that remdesivir reduces the risk of hospitalization by 87 per cent when it is given early in the course of illness, but because it is currently only available intravenously, it’s sometimes given too late to have its full effect, Götte explained. The United States and Europe recently recommended remdesivir for early use in outpatients with mild to moderate disease, and Götte hopes Canada will follow suit. While vaccination remains the most important available tool against SARS-CoV-2, he said remdesivir continues to be effective against the Omicron variant and could play an important role in reducing the burden on our health system. Götte said the new Pfizer oral antiviral drug that has just been approved by Health Canada appears to be as effective as remdesivir at preventing hospitalizations when given early. Another orally available antiviral drug, molnupiravir, has just been given FDA approval for use against COVID-19 in the United States, even though it appears to prevent only about 30 per cent of hospitalizations. It also shows activity against other viruses, including influenza. For Götte, the more antiviral options we have available, the better. If a new virus strikes, it will take time to develop a vaccine, and treatments will be needed around the world while we wait. The ideal situation would be to treat patients with more than one antiviral at a time, much like the “cocktails” used for HIV and hepatitis C. “When you combine antiviral drugs, it is more efficacious, more potent, and you reduce the likelihood of the virus developing resistance to any one drug,” he said. Collaboration is key Work will continue at the U of A to study, improve and design drugs that inhibit viral polymerases and other targets, using $55 million worth of new equipment and research funding recently awarded by the Government of Alberta. “The grant really brings together at the University of Alberta different, yet related, expertise including immunologists, virologists, biochemists and chemists, to increase the probability of success in these very complicated and difficult endeavours,” Götte said. Götte’s remdesivir research was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and the Alberta Ministry of Jobs, Economy and Innovation, and was carried out with help from graduate students Calvin Gordon and Hery Lee, research associate Egor Tchesnokov and scientists at Gilead.

Blog Updates January 20, 2022 Health and Wellness, Influenza, Internal Medicine How Long Does the Flu Last? Get answers to this question and more so you’re better prepared to fight the flu. Spread the love Most people don’t give the flu a second thought—until they have it. Then they have lots of questions, such as “how long does the flu last?”, “could I have prevented it?” and “how can I get better faster?” Since it’s always helpful to have answers to health-related questions before you really need to know them, here is some important information about this common illness. How long does the flu last? Although every person’s bout with the flu is different, symptoms typically last for 5 – 7 days. In some cases, especially if you had a flu shot, you’ll be sick for a shorter period of time. And sometimes symptoms will last longer than a week or you’ll continue to feel tired even after other symptoms go away. What can you do to protect yourself from getting the flu? The best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu shot every year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people ages 6 months and up get an annual flu shot, unless your doctor recommends otherwise. Each year the flu shot contains protection against the flu strains expected to be the most common. Additionally, the same things that protect you from COVID-19 protect you from the flu—stay away from people who are sick, wash your hands often and don’t touch your face. Flu Shots still available! Our week day Flu Clinic is located at our Immunization Clinic (7473 Perkins Road- It is the white brick building between the Main Clinic and The Baton Rouge Clinic Urgent Care/Albertsons). Flu Shots will be given Monday-Friday, 8AM to 4:30PM. Patients will park and enter the building. No appointment necessary. What are the most common flu symptoms? Flu symptoms may include fever, sore throat, cough, fatigue, body aches, headache, runny or stuffy nose. You may also have vomiting or diarrhea, although this is more common in children than adults. Many of these symptoms are similar to COVID-19 symptoms. The only way to know for sure which virus you have is to get tested. How can you treat the flu if you get it? When you have the flu, the best thing to do is to stay home, get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids and let the virus run its course. Over-the-counter pain relievers may help with fever and aches. Some people may benefit from antiviral drugs, which can lessen symptoms, shorten the amount of time you are sick and reduce the risk of flu complications, such as pneumonia. These drugs need to be given at the start of the illness and are especially helpful for people at a high risk of developing serious illness from the flu.

(photo credit: REUTERS/PETER NICHOLLS) Five human cases of the H5N6 strain of avian influenza have been reported in China in recent weeks, the Center for Health Protection (CHP) of the Hong Kong Department of Health reported on Thursday. Two of the patients have died.Four out of the five cases had confirmed exposure to poultry, although it is as of yet unclear how the fifth case got infected, according to the Department of Health. All the cases were infected in December.The World Health Organization (WHO) reported on Friday that all the cases had a history of exposure to poultry prior to infection and that none of their family members had developed symptoms. No epidemiological links were found between the five cases. Additionally, between January 7 and 13, four new cases of human infections of the H9N2 strain of bird flu were reported in China. All four are in mild condition and have already recovered. All had a history of poultry exposure and no epidemiological links were found between the four cases. 24 cases of H9N2 were reported in China in 2021.A spike in the number of human infections caused by H5N6 has been reported in China in the past year.

(credit: MICHAEL GILADI/FLASH90)According to the WHO, the rise in H5N6 cases may reflect the continued circulation of the virus in birds and enhanced surveillance due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The WHO added that the zoonotic threat remains elevated due to the spread of the viruses among birds, but that the overall pandemic risk associated with the strain of bird flu has not significantly changed.The increase in human infections caused by the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza is causing concern among experts, who say that a previously circulating strain appears to have changed and could be more infectious to people. "The increase in human cases in China this year is of concern. It's a virus that causes high mortality," said Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, to Reuters.On Friday, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that a wild bird in South Carolina was found to be infected with highly pathogenic Eurasian H5 avian influenza, the first case of this variant of bird flu found in the US since 2016.The bird, a wild American wigeon, was found in Colleton County, South Carolina. Other variants of the bird flu have been detected in the US in recent years. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now The USDA added that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still considers the risk to the general public from the variant to be low. No human infections from the variant have occurred in the US.The USDA advised people to minimize direct contact with wild birds and advised bird owners to practice good biosecurity and keep their birds isolated from wild birds.A large number of bird flu outbreaks have been reported throughout Europe, Africa and Asia in recent weeks, mostly due to the H5N1 subtype, which comes from the H5 lineage, according to the World Organization for Animal Health. Over a million birds were found to be infected with the variant in Israel in recent months, although Israel's Agriculture Ministry declared on Friday that the outbreak is now under control.The OIE has urged countries to increase surveillance for HPAI outbreaks, as the virus has been reported in over 40 countries since July.The H5N1, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6 and H5N8 subtypes of HPAI are circulating in bird and poultry populations across the globe, sparking concern at OIE which called this an “unprecedented genetic variability of subtypes... creating an epidemiologically challenging landscape.”Earlier this month, OIE Director General Monique Eloit told Reuters that "this time the situation is more difficult and more risky because we see more variants emerge, which make them harder to follow.""Eventually the risk is that it mutates or that it mixes with a human flu virus that can be transmitted between humans then suddenly it takes on a new dimension," she added.Germany’s Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, told the German Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) that Europe is experiencing its “strongest avian flu epidemic ever.”The institute added that “there is no end in sight” as the virus spreads throughout the continent and around the world, with new cases reported on a daily basis.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags health China flu Assuta Health bird flu Hot Opinion Dear Jared Kushner, the Jewish people need you By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

(Photo by Carsten Koall/Getty Images, File)TOPICS:BulgariaCanadaColombiaColumbiaPortugalSouth Carolina,United StatesUnited StatesUnited States Department of AgricultureCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - A duck killed by a hunter in South Carolina had a contagious and dangerous bird flu that has not been detected in the wild in the U.S. in five years, officials said.The flu poses a low risk to people but can spread quickly through chicken houses and other poultry businesses.The Eurasian H5 avian influenza was first detected by Clemson University scientists and confirmed by federal testing, the school said in a news release.The U.S. Department of Agriculture alerted global health officials. Scattered Eurasian H5 infections have been detected in 2022 from Portugal to Bulgaria and in December, two cases were reported in eastern Canada, officials said.Anyone who has poultry, including backyard farms, needs to review their practices to keep birds safe from disease, said State Veterinarian Michael J. Neault, who runs Clemson University's Livestock Poultry Health program.Those practices include thoroughly washing hands before and after handling wild and domesticated birds and using gloves and other protective gear when handling live birds.Farmers should also keep their birds away from areas where geese and ducks roam, clean their cages and coops regularly and buy new birds from reputable sources and keep them away from the rest of the flock for 30 days, the university said.“So far we have no indication that (the flu) has jumped from wild migratory birds to poultry and we’d very much like to keep it that way,” Neault said in a statement.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsEEOFCCFCCPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Adamari López is hospitalized after contracting COVID-19Skip to main contentSkip to footer Adamari López is hospitalized after contracting COVID-19USAEspañaAmericasMéxicoCelebritiesCelebrity CouplesCelebrity MomsCelebrity KidsCelebrity ParentsCelebrity Homes EntertainmentMusicMoviesTVWhat to WatchRoyalsKate MiddletonMeghan MarklePrince HarryQueen LetiziaQueen MaximaCharlotte CasiraghiSpanish Royals British RoyalsMonaco Royals BeautySkincareMakeupNails HairCelebrity Beauty FashionCelebrity StyleRoyal StyleFashion TrendsStreet StyleRed CarpetRunway LifestyleHealth and WellnessFitness and WorkoutLeisure and TravelParentingFoodRecipesHealthy FoodLatin CookingDrinks and CocktailsAmericasCelebridadesEntretenimientoRealezaBellezaModaLifestyleFotosLatina PowerhouseLatina PowerhousePhotosHOLA+CelebritiesEntertainmentRoyalsBeautyFashionLifestyleFoodAmericasLatina PowerhousePhotosHola+ HomeCelebrities© @adamarilopezAdamari López, hospitalized for COVID-19The TV presenter revealed that her six-year-old daughter Alaïa is also infected with the virus Cynthia Valdez JANUARY 18, 2022 12:53 PM ESTJAN 18, 2022, 12:53 PM EST Adamari López took social media to confirm l that she had tested positive for COVID-19. The nerve-wracking news immediately raised concern to the tv host which had a bad experience three years ago when contracting influenza.López, which is a cancer survivor, took severe measures to take care of herself and, alongside her medical team, decided to get hospitalized and receive a special treatment that would help her fight against her symptoms. “Taking the necessary precautionary measures and talking to my doctors and my medical team, we decided to get hospitalized and treatment because of my symptoms,” Adamari explained in a video.“Remember that about three years ago I had influenza and I was in feeble health, in a challenging state and with the concern that the same thing would happen to me again, having symptoms that could be similar, we made the decision to go the hospital,” she continued explaining from the comfort of her home.

Equally, you must not touch their droppings, eggs or bedding."Coventry City Council said it is working with the UK Health Security Agency, the Animal and Plant Health Agency and the RSPCA to manage the situation and protect public health and the risk to other birds, wildlife and pets.Anyone who has found a sick or dead bird, it said, should report it to the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Following a number of cases of bird flu across Great Britain, the Chief Veterinary Officers from England, Scotland and Wales have declared an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) across the whole of the nation, to mitigate the risk of the disease spreading.Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, external, Twitter, external and Instagram, external.

Over the past two decades, several high-impact pathogens have emerged or re-emerged. These include three new coronaviruses—namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012; and the current COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2). There are also several highly pathogenic influenza A viruses such as H5N1 in 2003; H1N1 pandemic in 2009; and the H7N9 in 2013. More recent pandemics include the Zika virus in 2016 and the continuing rise and spread of Ebola in West and Central Africa since 2013. This trend of the increasing prevalence of pandemics is projected to continue, driven predominantly by urbanization, climate change, environmental degradation, and persistent social and economic inequality as well as the mass globalization of trade and travel. This is because the prevalence of pandemics has been catalyzed by the movement of pathogenic transmission among nonhuman animals to humans (zoonotic). This is how we prevent the next pandemicPlay The current state of pandemic preparedness Past epidemics which have shown pandemic potential were predominantly identified through unusual clusters of severe cases or deaths in populations. However, this form of identification is often missed by classic surveillance systems, which means identification is weak. Screening of viruses has shown that approximately 1.7 million exist across 25 consequence viral families. Of these, 500,000-700,000 have a high probability of being zoonotic. In practice, even if the likelihood of spreading is low, the potential impact will be scaled, as illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, this justifies investment in structures that can prevent pandemics. Over the past decade, there have been global health security initiatives to expand existing capacities, processes, and institutional arrangements to prevent pandemics. These include the international health regulations on the global health security agenda; however, these have been insufficient in preventing, for example, the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Following this recent viral pandemic, there is an unmet need to create global strategies, policies, and regulatory frameworks that adequately address all aspects of disease emergence. How does the COVID-19 Pandemic Compare to Other Pandemics? These activities are collectively termed pandemic preparedness and consist of several core components: surveillance, to detect pathogens, data collection, and modeling to determine rate and means of spread, improvements in public health guidance and communication, and the development of safe and efficacious vaccines and therapies. The world health organisation (WHO) pandemic preparedness and response The WHO pandemic phases wait developed in 1999 and revised in 2005 these phrases have global appeal and provide a framework for countries across the world full pandemic preparedness and response planning. The WHO define pandemic preparedness as a continuous process of planning, exercising, revising, and translating international, and sub-national pandemic preparedness and response plans. A pandemic plan is therefore a dynamic document that undergoes regular review and revisions were necessary based on outcomes and conclusions taken from outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or simulation exercises. Pandemic preparedness was borne out of the international health regulations review committees declaration that globally, the response to severe influenza pandemic or any similarly global, sustained, and threatening public health emergency is insufficient.

The International Health Regulations (IHR) compel all WHO member states to meet the standards for pandemic preparedness; however, progress towards meeting the IHR husband inconsistent, on several countries have not been able to meet basic requirements for compliance. Since the establishment of the WHO framework, multiple outbreaks since then, namely the 2014 West Africa ebola epidemic, have revealed the gaps related to the rapid detection of the viral disease, availability and access ability of basic care facilities, tracing of contacts, quarantine, and isolation procedures. Moreover, it has exposed issues related to preparedness outside of the health sector, including lack of global coordination and the mobilization of response. These gaps are exacerbated in resource-limited contexts and have posed catastrophic challenges during relatively localized epidemics – which demonstrate the potentially dire implications during fully-fledged global pandemics. This potential has been realized most recently in the COVID-19 pandemics. How to prevent a pandemic Surveillance systems are considered to be a mode of preventing pandemics. There are both current and historic examples of surveillance systems. For example, the global early warning and response system is a formalized means of monitoring and reporting outbreaks of disease which was established in 2006 by the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the world organization for animal health (OIE). Read Here: Pandemic vs Epidemic Partners across the world are therefore able to work in real-time, sharing information on local and national disease outbreaks as well as conducting a rapid cross-sectoral risk assessment. Collectively, they support the forecasting, prevention, and control of emerging diseases. An example of existing surveillance is the WHO’s global influences surveillance on response system which has been evaluating and monitoring the evolution of influenza viruses, the information from which helps develop annual flu vaccines and served as a global alert mechanism for the emergence of new flu viruses that show the potential to cause a pandemic. This surveillance response changed as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which exposed the absence of information about the severity and impact of the disease was inadequate for mitigating the effects on public health. Therefore, most influenzas assistance across the globe incorporated standardized case definitions for influence illnesses. Improving exist surveillance to prevent a pandemic A global, risk-based, multifactorial viral surveillance network is hypothesized to be essential in detecting viral spillover before it becomes a local outbreak. This would preclude the need to carry out viral surveillance worldwide it would rely on strategic sampling in wild animals, humans, livestock, and known hotspot regions. This proactive approach would mean that any viral diseases that threaten to spill over into human populations will be detected in real-time, and test samples so many viruses from a prioritized list of viral families would be conducted (i.e. those originating from wild animals). In parallel with this, a global surveillance network protocol and support tool would be necessary to make sure that these viruses are in emanated before infecting humans. It is believed that this aim is possible owing to new discovery projects such as the global virome project and a large volume of metadata which how distributed are deposited in global databases. These data could also contribute to improved diagnostic reagents and then use through a more widely available, cost-effective pathogen detection on sequencing devices. Moreover, more advanced analytics, combined with bioinformatic tools and artificial intelligence, would enhance the capacity of a global surveillance system. This would require strong political commitment and unified governance as well as long-term financing. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have illustrated the devastating socio-economic, political, and health impacts of a pandemic which presents an opportunity to leverage political support to establish such global surveillance.

Read our privacy noticeA case of avian influenza has been confirmed in the Isle of Man.It is the first time the virus, which is highly contagious amongst birds but not people, has been recorded in the island.The Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture (DEFA) responded on Friday after a bird keeper in Sulby found 11 of his geese dead near a pond on his property.Samples were taken and sent to the UK for analysis, which have confirmed the geese died from the H5N1 strain.Also in the newsMSPCA column: The dogs that ‘sing’ to their owners and love companyRoisin’s TV bid for interior design dreamGlen Maye craft market ‘still going strong’ after yearsSpend a bonkers night in Ramsey with TV star Timmy MallettMeanwhile, the UK is currently facing its largest ever outbreak, which has led to thousands of farmed birds being culled since November.In view of this, a ‘protection zone’ of one kilometre (0.6 miles) has been introduced around the affected site, in which keepers must house their birds and must not move them off their property.An all-island ‘surveillance zone’ has also been introduced and all bird keepers are being advised to house their poultry, practice good biosecurity, and disinfect boots and equipment regularly.Information regarding the restrictions that have been put in place today by the department, along with a map that clearly shows the protection zone can be found online.Chief veterinary officer, Amy Beckett, said: ‘Due to this positive case we are asking all owners on Island to house their flocks and asking the public not to touch ill or dead birds as a precaution.’‘Although this virus can spread quickly amongst birds the risk to the public is very low and well cooked eggs and poultry remain safe to eat.’Jacqui Dunn, head of health protection with Public Health, added: ‘This is an infectious virus which spreads among birds, but it is very unusual for humans to be affected. However, we are issuing the precautionary advice as it is possible for humans to catch the virus through close contact with an infected bird, dead or alive.’We do want to reassure residents that the risk of their catching the disease is low and ask that people follow the advice.’There are more than 20 clinical signs indicating that a bird could be suffering with avian influenza, including lethargy, unresponsiveness and a loss of balance.More information can be found on the DEFA website and anyone who suspects a case, or has in their possession a bird that they suspect has the disease, should contact the Animal Health Team by emailing [email protected] or calling 01624 685844.More About:SulbySPREAD THE NEWSCommentsThis article has no comments yet.

Influenza has returned to Europe at a faster-than-expected rate this winter after almost disappearing last year, raising concerns about a prolonged "twindemic" with COVID-19 amid some doubts about the effectiveness of flu vaccines. Lockdowns, mask-wearing and social distancing that have become the norm in Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic knocked out flu last winter, temporarily eradicating a virus that globally kills about 650,000 a year, according to EU figures. But that has now changed as countries adopt less strict measures to fight COVID-19 due to widespread vaccination. READ MORE Snow, ice blasts through South with powerful winter storm Impact assessment, aid efforts underway as world responds to Tonga tsunami Since mid-December, flu viruses have been circulating in Europe at a higher-than-expected rate, the European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC) reported this month. In December, the number of flu cases in European intensive care units (ICU) rose steadily to peak at 43 in the last week of the year, ECDC and World Health Organization data show. This season, France has so far recorded 72 serious cases of flu, with six deaths. That is well below pre-pandemic levels — with weekly flu cases in ICUs peaking at over 400 at the same stage in 2018, for example. But it is a big increase on last year, when there was only one flu case in an ICU in the whole of December, data show. The return of the virus could be the start of an unusually long flu season that could stretch well into the summer, the ECDC's top expert on influenza Pasi Penttinen told Reuters. "If we start to lift all measures, the big concern I have for influenza is that, because we have had such a long time of almost no circulation in the European population, maybe we will shift away from normal seasonal patterns," he said. He said dismantling restrictive measures in the spring could prolong the circulation of flu far beyond the normal end of the European season in May. A "twindemic" could put excessive pressure on already overstretched health systems, the ECDC said in its report. In France, three regions — including the Paris region — are facing a flu epidemic, according to data published by the French health ministry last week. Others are in a pre-epidemic phase. This season, France has so far recorded 72 serious cases of flu, with six deaths. Dominant strain Further complicating matters, the dominant flu strain circulating this year appears so far to be the H3 of the A virus, which usually causes the most severe cases among the elderly. Penttinen said it was too early to make a final assessment of flu vaccines because a larger number of ill patients was needed for real-world analyses. But lab tests show the vaccines available this year "are not going to be optimal" against H3. The authorities there extended by one month the vaccination period to the end of February to boost inoculations. That is largely because there was very little or no virus circulating when the vaccines' composition was decided last year, making it harder for vaccine makers to predict which strain would be dominant in the coming flu season. Vaccines Europe, which represents top vaccine makers in the region, acknowledged the strain selection was made more difficult by very low flu circulation last year, but added there was not enough data yet to assess the effectiveness of this season's shots. Flu vaccines are adapted every year to make them as effective as possible against ever-changing flu viruses. Their composition is decided six months before the flu season kicks in, based on circulation of viruses in the opposite hemisphere. That gives time for drugmakers to develop and make the shots. Europe-wide data on flu vaccine uptake is not yet available. But national figures for France show coverage is not as broad as authorities hoped for. The authorities there extended by one month the vaccination period to the end of February to boost inoculations. According to figures released last week, 12 million people have so far been vaccinated, about 45% of the targeted population. "There is still a large room for improvement to limit the impact of the flu epidemic," the health ministry said in a statement on Jan. 11. This year's target is to vaccinate 75% of people at risk. Vaccines Europe said the industry had supplied large numbers of flu shots, despite the strain on production facilities posed by the pandemic.

The individual is currently well and self-isolating.”The UK has recently seen a large number of bird flu outbreaks among animals, with the UK’s Chief Veterinary Officer, Christine Middlemiss, issuing warnings to bird owners over hygiene.There are currently 64 cases of avian influenza H5N1 in England, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), with new cases being confirmed on a daily basis.There are also a number of cases in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Cases of avian flu have been detected in birds on farms across the country (Danny Lawson/PA)Some strains of bird flu can pass from birds to people, but this is extremely rare, according to the UKHSA.It usually requires close contact with an infected bird, so the risk to humans is generally considered very low.Human-to-human transmission of bird flu is also very rare, the organisation said.The case was detected after the Animal and Plant health Agency (APHA) identified an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in a flock of birds.The infected birds have all been culled.Further lab analysis showed that the virus was the ‘H5’ type found in birds.The UKHSA said that, at this point, it has not been possible to confirm that this is a H5N1 infection (the strain that is currently circulating in birds in the UK).But the UKHSA has notified the World Health Organisation (WHO), which continuously monitors avian and other zoonotic influenza viruses through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).It said this is the first human case of this strain in the UK, although there have been cases elsewhere globally.Professor Isabel Oliver, chief scientific officer at the UKHSA, said: “While the risk of avian flu to the general public is very low, we know that some strains do have the potential to spread to humans and that’s why we have robust systems in place to detect these early and take action.“Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we continue to monitor the situation closely.“We have followed up all of this individual’s contacts and have not identified any onward spread.”“We took swift action to limit the spread of the disease at the site in question, all infected birds have been humanely culled, and cleansing and disinfection of the premises is underway.“This is a reminder that stringent cleanliness when keeping animals is important.“We are seeing a growing number of cases in birds on both commercial farms and in backyard flocks across the country. Implementing scrupulous biosecurity measures will help keep your birds safe.”For contacts of an infected person who have the highest risk, the UKHSA contacts them daily to see if they have developed symptoms.People are also offered anti-viral treatment after exposure to infected birds to stop the virus reproducing in their body.Swabs are also carried out on people even if they do not have symptoms.“It can result in a nasty infection for the individual concerned but there has never been any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1 so at present I wouldn’t consider this to be a significant public health risk.”Paul Wigley, professor of avian infection and immunity at the University of Liverpool, said: “Whilst avian influenza has the potential to be transmitted from poultry to humans, it is very rare and, as in this case, usually due to close and long-term contact with infected birds.“Avian influenza such as the H5 serotype is largely adapted to infect birds and so is very unlikely to be transmitted from person to person.“The advice given by APHA and UKHSA over contact with infected birds is sensible and should be followed. The risk of wider infection in the general public remains low.”Sorry, we are not accepting comments on this article.Similar storiesWhat the papers say – November 11UK News|3 hours agoGovernment says it will not allow events to be ‘hijacked’ by antisemitismUK News|4 hours agoStarmer and Macron to discuss Ukraine ahead of Armistice commemorationsUK News|7 hours agoSFA chief tells of emergency eyecare surgery before key Euros matchUK News|7 hours agoDrivers handed £4.1m Dartford Crossing fines by mistakeUK News|7 hours agoMost popular1Rotten eggs put in appeal collection binNews|19 hours ago2GST heading your way for 2027News|Nov 83‘My Guernsey-born great-uncle deserves the Victoria Cross’News|Just now4Queens Road Medical Practice opens at new site on MondayNews|Nov 95St James grateful but future is still uncertainNews|Nov 9Follow us onGet involvedSend Us Your NewsSubscribe to the Guernsey PressUseful linksAdvertise with usMaking a complaintGuernsey AirportGuernsey HarboursAbout the websiteAbout usContact usTerms of website usePrivacy PolicyAcceptable Use PolicyHomepageFollow us onTwitterFacebook Back to top© 2024 Guernsey Press.
