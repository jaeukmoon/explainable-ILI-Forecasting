Yet, influenza vaccination rates in the elderly in Malaysia were considerably low as it is not part of Malaysia’s national immunization program, with substantial mortality and morbidity consequences. Therefore, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) for the elderly in Malaysia compared with the current no-vaccination policy. A static cost-utility model, with a lifetime horizon based on age, was used for the analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness and health outcomes associated with QIV. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the effects of variations in the parameters. The use of QIV in Malaysia’s elderly population would prevent 66,326 potential influenza cases and 888 potential deaths among the elderly, leading to 10,048 potential quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The QIV would also save over USD 4.4 million currently spent on influenza-related hospitalizations and reduce productivity losses by approximately USD 21.6 million. The ICER per QALY gained from a third-party payer’s perspective would be USD 2216, which is lower than the country’s gross domestic product per capita. A QIV-based vaccination program in the elderly was found to be highly cost-effective, therefore would reduce the financial burden of managing influenza and reduce pre-mature death related to this disease.

It is characterized by a sudden onset of fever (38–40 °C), cough (usually dry), headaches, myalgia, sore throat and inflammation of the respiratory tract. Severe influenza could cause complications such as pneumonia, septicemia, meningitis and cardiac complications1. Early screening of influenza may help lessen the symptoms and disease severity. Currently, a comprehensive action plan was developed that would allow an effective influenza management2. Global estimates associate influenza with 3–5 million severe cases and 290,000–650,000 respiratory deaths annually3. Tropical regions such as Malaysia have no clear seasonal patterns and influenza circulation is year-round, typically with several peaks during the monsoon seasons4. Very few studies were conducted on the burden of influenza disease in Malaysia. From 2005 to 2009, 14.0% of 7117 respiratory specimens from patients with influenza-like illness were positive for influenza virus5. Following this, current surveillance has reported that the influenza-positive rate ranged from 3.6 to 7.3% from the number of samples tested annually, ranging from 5391 to 94056. A previous study has suggested the occurrence of influenza in Malaysia is underestimated due to the method of influenza detection4. Furthermore, influenza is not classified as a notifiable disease, resulting in an underrepresentation of actual cases, as a significant proportion of cases are not confirmed by laboratory testing.Vaccination is the best strategy to prevent and control influenza and its complications7. Influenza vaccination is strongly recommended for those at higher risk for influenza complications such as the elderly. Prior studies have demonstrated that influenza vaccination could mitigate the risk of influenza-associated complications, reduce mortality rates among children, and protect pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions1,8,9,10. Influenza vaccination also plays a crucial role in reducing the severity of illness in infected patients10. The most widely available influenza vaccines are the quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs), which contain two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes) and two influenza B strains (Victoria and Yamagata lineages), as per World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Currently, there are a few licensed vaccines available and approved to be used in elderly, which are trivalent (TIV) or quadrivalent (QIV), cell-cultured or egg-based, standard-dose or high-dose, and adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted vaccine. Based on the review of available studies, the high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) is highly recommended for older people in the 2022–2023 season because it is more effective compared to other types of vaccines11. Besides, a consensus has been made by the Malaysian Influenza Working Group (MIWG) for the elderly to receive influenza vaccine annually12. However, in the event that no high-dose vaccine options are accessible, it is advisable to provide any age-appropriate influenza vaccine12.The target of influenza vaccine coverage has been agreed to by countries in a World Health Assembly resolution on 28 May 200313. However, a report from one tertiary care centre in Malaysia detected poor uptake of influenza vaccination among older patients14. Meanwhile, a nationwide study reported only 5.5% influenza vaccination coverage rates for the elderly15. One possible reason for the trend was that influenza vaccines are only funded for healthcare workers although healthcare services are meant to be free for the elderly in public facilities. Due to their lower immunity, the elderly are more prone to contracting influenza compared with other age groups16, and are particularly vulnerable to related complications. An Italian study reported that most influenza-related deaths occurred in the elderly17. Therefore, there is a need to include the elderly in a national-level influenza vaccination program to enhance vaccine uptake within this group.The vaccination initiative requires a thorough consideration of potential vaccine costs and savings on treatment and outbreak control related expenses. Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) are widely used to help decision makers choose the most appropriate interventions based on costs and effectiveness within a constrained budget. Across the Asia–Pacific region, several cost-effectiveness studies have been conducted in the use of influenza vaccine in the elderly18,19,20. For instance, a Korean study reported that the inclusion of influenza vaccines in the National Immunization Program (NIP) for those aged 50–64 years was cost effective, with QIVs emerging as the preferred option based on its greater protection against influenza B21. To the best of our knowledge, no cost-effectiveness analysis of the influenza vaccine has been performed in Malaysia. To address this gap, we used a cost-utility model to predict the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of QIVs compared with the current no-vaccination policy for individuals aged 60 years and older in Malaysia.MethodsCost of influenzaInfluenza-related costs were estimated from a societal perspective, i.e. costs to the health care system, costs of over-the-counter (OTC) medication for Malaysians aged 60 years and above, and costs related to productivity losses in the working elderly and their caregivers. Influenza-related hospitalization costs were based on the Casemix database in a Malaysian teaching hospital from 2010 to 2020. Casemix is a patient classification system that groups patient treatment episodes into categories that has similar resource use and same clinical features. Casemix is also known as Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG). The Casemix system used in this study, the MY-DRG, incorporated data from clinical coding based on the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) for diagnosis and International Classification of Disease, Clinical Modification 9th Revision (ICD-9-CM) for procedures22. All cases of influenza that were included in this study were identified according to a principal or secondary diagnosis coded in ICD-10 as J09, J10.0, J10.1, J10.8, J11.0, J11.1, J11.8, J12.8 and J12.9, representing influenza and its complications. The vaccine cost applied in this analysis was a public market price published by Sanofi Pasteur. Data from a previous local study was referenced for the administrative costs of a vaccine program23 and medication costs at a general practice (Table 1). The medication costs were calculated using the proportion of drug cost (27.7%) from the total provider’s cost for general practice in Malaysia24. Although, this was not specific for influenza treatment, the utilization in this model was agreed upon by the public health experts and it is appropriate for the Malaysia health system. Expert input and local data were gathered to estimate the cost of general practice (GP) visits and OTC medication for the treatment of influenza, respectively. Cost of GP visits was assumed to be the same as a local study done previously24, considering the majority of influenza-like-illness patients would visit public primary care facilities and the group of experts in the study agreed on two visits per episode of care2. Table 1 Model input value.Full size tableIndirect costs, which were productivity loss associated with the number of workdays lost and the average length of a hospital stay, were calculated based on expert opinion2 and estimates from the Casemix database. The cost was calculated using the human capital approach as previously described25. The estimated average daily productivity (USD 39.72) was calculated based on Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 202026, based on the assumption of 40 working hours per week or 8 working hours per day. Employment rates among the elderly were referenced from a recent study done in Malaysia27 while rates among their caregivers were based on the Department of Statistics Malaysia reports28. We estimated the costs of lost productivity of their caregivers due to hospitalization and disability in this population. This is because the caregivers would need to take leave from their work to accompany their hospitalized parents. The productivity lost for the patients and caregivers reflected the societal cost in this study.Influenza-related health parametersThe population utility rate was based on the estimated EQ-VAS score of the general adult Malaysian population using EQ-5D29. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to influenza were based on surveillance done in the UK for influenza-like illness among people aged over 65 years30. The QALY loss was assumed to be the same for both age groups in the model.The number of non-consulting influenza cases for one consultation was derived from the estimated number of patients with influenza-like illness who sought medical care in Thailand31. The influenza vaccination coverage rate was assumed at 75%, reflecting the 2003 World Health Assembly’s goal for the elderly13.Mortality rates per 100,000 were based on published estimates from a recent study of influenza-associated mortality in Malaysians aged 60–74 years and 75 years and above32. Influenza-related hospitalizations rates were estimated based on the probability of hospitalization over flu infection rates33 for people over 65 years old in the US and applied to the mortality rates in Malaysia32. The same formula was used to calculate the GP consultation rates, whereby the probability of outpatient visits for influenza33 in non-high risk populations was applied to mortality rates from a previous published study32.The proportion of illness due to influenza A, A (H1N1), A(H3N2), B, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria for each year between 2013 until 2019 was gathered from the FluNet database for Malaysia34.Influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE)The average vaccine effectiveness of QIV against influenza A and influenza B, respectively were based on the method adopted in a Canadian model16 and an Italian study35. In this study, the IVE of QIV against influenza A and matched B-lineage influenza were derived from Clement et al.36 and adjusted according to the age groups included in the model. The same source was referenced to estimate IVE against mismatched-influenza B by using the cross-protection rates from the study36. The assumption was that IVE against influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) would be identical. IVE against health outcomes like influenza-related GP visits, hospitalizations, and death in each age group were calculated as described for the Canadian16 and Italian35 model.Model structure and inputOur modelling strategy was to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) among the Malaysian elderly population who were vaccinated with QIVs versus those who were not. We developed a static cost-utility model to determine the health and economic impact, as previously designed in Canada16 and Italy35, to estimate the cost-effectiveness of QIVs. The previous published model has described the impact of switching TIV to QIV with three basic simulations including no vaccination, TIV and QIV and estimated the outcomes of each strategy among all aged groups. Their parameters input was selected based on their country’s preference and data availability. Both of these studies evaluate the cost-effectiveness from the societal and provider perspective16,35. In contrast, our model described the cost-effectiveness and health outcome of QIV and no vaccination strategy in the elderly mainly from the third-party payer perspective. Health outcomes prevented with QIVs were estimated by subtracting the expected rates of influenza-related health outcomes with QIVs from observed rates in non-vaccinated populations. The outputs included were health-related benefits and the number of QALYs gained, life-years gained and saved workdays. Influenza cases prevented were estimated by adding non-consulting cases to GP visits. The elderly population in the model were stratified into two groups: those aged 60 to 74 years and 75 years and above. The costs of each outcome were derived by multiplying the outcome by the estimated unit cost. Finally, differences in total costs and total QALYs were computed to calculate the ICERs.Local data were referenced when available. European or American data mostly were utilized in circumstances where there was insufficient local data or when international evidence was determined to be of higher quality and more valid than evidence derived from the Malaysian setting. The model included all targeted populations that were at risk of influenza-related illness, as identified in a published report37. Life expectancy for Malaysians above 60 years were obtained from national statistics38 and World Data Atlas39. The range of input values and relevant sources included for each parameter in the model are summarized in Table 1.AnalysisBase case analysisIn the cost-utility analysis, the targeted study cohort used for CEA was stratified into two age groups within the vaccinated and unvaccinated study populations. Base case analysis was conducted based on third-party payer and societal perspectives. From a third-party payer perspective, the model only included estimated health costs directly associated with treating, managing, and caring for patients with influenza, which included consultations, hospitalizations, and prescriptions. Indirect costs, specifically productivity loss due to influenza and OTC medications, were included for a societal perspective. The costs and health outcomes were discounted by an annual rate of 3%40. The cost-effectiveness threshold of willingness to pay were set at USD 30,984, which was equivalent to three times the GDP per capita in Malaysia as recommended by the World Health Organization26.Sensitivity analysisDeterministic sensitivity analyses (DSA) were conducted to test the effect of single variables on the overall economic conclusions of the model. The tornado diagram was used to visually demonstrate the resulting ICERs when one variable was changed to either the maximum or minimum value within its range. The diagram was used to identify the relative importance of a variable since it could demonstrate if changes to a variable could alter the economic conclusion. A variation of ± 20% was assumed for all parameters except for the discount rate, for which the value was varied from 0 to 5% (Table 1). In an ICER tornado diagram, the importance of each variable on the economic conclusion was positioned from top to bottom. The tails of each bar indicated the maximum and minimum ICER for each variable. The dashed line represented the ICER from the reference case, as a reference for changes in ICERs.Subsequently, a multivariate analysis was performed with a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Instead of changing one parameter value at a time, the PSA changed all variables at once according to their plausible values by random sampling from their distributions. The model was simulated 1000 times with the PSA from the probability distribution of each parameter. All costs and influenza-related outcome rates such as influenza-related GP consultation rate, influenza-related hospitalization rate and influenza-related mortality rate were assigned to a log-normal distribution. Utility data, vaccine coverage rate, percentage of patients consulting a physician, strain circulation and vaccine efficiency followed a beta distribution (Table 1). The cost-effectiveness scatterplot was used to test the stability of the model results. All costs are reported in 2020 United States dollars (USD), converted from Malaysian Ringgits (MYR) using the exchange rate as in 2020 (4.2 MYR = 1 USD).ResultsBase case analysisHealth-related outcomeThe cost-effectiveness model predicted that the use of QIVs in the elderly population in Malaysia would prevent 19,235 cases of influenza that required medical consultation, 47,091 cases that led to a GP visit, 3195 hospitalizations, and 888 deaths. Furthermore, the cost-utility model predicted that the use of QIVs would avoid 79,206 lost workdays. The QIVs would result in 10,048 QALYs gained and 11,160 life years gained. Outcomes results were also reported in age-stratified groups of 64–74 years and ≥ 75 years (Table 2). Table 2 Health outcomes avoided with quadrivalent influenza vaccines for the elderly in Malaysia.Full size tableCost-utility analysisThe use of QIV in an influenza vaccination strategy would save costs on GP consultations, hospitalizations, prescription medicine, OTC medications and productivity losses due to illness and death compared with no vaccination. It would reduce productivity losses by approximately USD 21.6 million and would save USD 4.4 million currently spent on influenza-related hospitalizations (Table 3). From the third-party payer perspective, the incremental cost per QALYs gained between QIV and no vaccination was USD 2,216, which was lower than one per capita GDP of the country (Table 4). Given that the World Health Organization defined a cost effective intervention as being less than three times the national annual GDP per capita, the QIV was highly cost effective41. Table 3 Cost saved with the use of QIV for the targeted population in Malaysia (USD).Full size tableTable 4 Total cost associated with influenza for no-vaccination and QIV from the third-party payer perspective, incremental cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).Full size tableSensitivity analysesIn this study, we conducted multiple one-way sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of uncertainty in various parameters as listed in Table 1. The results of the analyses demonstrated that this CEA model was most sensitive to the influenza-related mortality rate (from USD 4242 in the low-case scenario to USD 1500 in the high-case scenario) followed by vaccine efficiency against B strains (from USD 3481 in the low-case scenario to USD 1898 in the high-case scenario) and vaccine efficiency against A strains (from USD 2753 in the low-case scenario to USD 1928 in the high-case scenario), as depicted in Fig. 1. Figure 1Deterministic sensitivity analysis. GP general practitioner.Full size imageIn probabilistic simulations, where the ICERs from the PSA were plotted onto the cost-effectiveness plane, all the outcomes were located to the right of the threshold lines in quadrant I (i.e. cost-effective). The minimum and maximum ICERs obtained through the PSA were USD 817 and USD 8138, respectively. This finding confirmed that QIV was a cost-effective option in the Malaysian elderly compared with no-vaccination (Fig. 2). Figure 2Scatter plot of incremental costs versus incremental QALYs in probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). QALYs quality-adjusted life years.Full size imageDiscussionIn this study, we conducted a full health economy evaluation analysis with the aim of applying the economic modelling method to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of QIV compared with no-vaccination among Malaysians aged over 60 years. Although high-dose QIV is strongly advised for the elderly11, the standard dose was administered in this study due to its availability in Malaysia. The cost-utility model showed that the QIV was highly cost-effective from the third-party payer’s perspective as the ICER estimates was USD 2216, below the threshold of three times national GDP per capita value (USD 30,984). The population aged 60 to 74 years demonstrated the greatest improvements in health outcomes when compared to much older group. The observed result can be attributed to the higher population size within this age category in comparison to individuals aged 75 years and older. Furthermore, the vaccine efficacy is reduced in this population as a result of the changes in their immune system, known as immunosenescence, which can weaken immune responses. This phenomenon may result in a compromised capacity for generating a robust immune response to vaccinations, thereby diminishing their efficacy.The cost saved was found to be higher among the population aged 60 to 74 years, of which productivity lost due to illness and death dominated the cost saved (USD 14.6 million) followed by hospitalization cost (USD 2.5 million). The cost saved was calculated based on the health outcome avoided by multiplying each case by their respective cost. In this study, hospitalization cost was collected from the casemix database from a teaching hospital in Malaysia. Inpatient cost was estimated at USD1397 per admission among the elderly patients infected with influenza-related disease. The findings of our study revealed a little discrepancy when compared to a prior study, which documented an average cost of USD 8330 for individuals between the ages of 65 and 84 who were admitted to the hospital9. Higher costs observed in this age group were attributed to infection-related complications and an extended hospitalization period.Overall, the adoption of QIV would incur more cost. From the base-case estimates, the use of QIVs would cost USD 22,263,781 more than no vaccination. There were limitations to comparing this finding with existing studies, given that most existing studies compared QIVs with trivalent vaccines (TIV)35,42. Nevertheless, when QIVs was compared with the TIV, the cost of QIVs was deemed higher than trivalent vaccines. For instance, a study conducted in Taiwan reported an additional cost of USD 394,000 when switching from trivalent vaccines to QIV43. However, this Taiwanese study reported an additional 10,557 QALYs with the utilization of QIVs that yielded an ICER of USD 3015.07. This finding was consistent with the finding of our analysis, which demonstrated that the usage of QIVs would lead to 10,048 QALYs gained and would yield an ICER of USD 2216. Furthermore, the ICER reported by our study was lower than the threshold, which established that QIV was cost-effective. Hence, the adoption of QIVs would be cost-effective and reduce the risk of pre-mature deaths related to influenza, despite showing increments in vaccination costs35,42,43,44,45,46.Based on the guideline on economic evaluation of immunization programs provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), the utilization of static models was deemed suitable for assessing the effectiveness of influenza vaccination within populations that do not significantly contribute to disease transmission. Compared to dynamic models, static models do not account for a herd immunity effect, which can occur particularly in younger populations. However, this should have little effect on our results, as the primary focus of this study was on elderly people. Besides, the vaccine coverage was significantly low among the older people in Malaysia, the indirect impact of herd immunity would be limited.In this study, we calculated the patient’s and caregiver’s productivity losses based on the duration of hospitalization and outpatient visits from the Casemix database and expert input2. According to a current study conducted in Malaysia, 16% of the elderly aged over 65 years are currently employed27. Therefore, the estimation of absenteeism due to workdays lost as well as productivity loss due to pre-mature death for the elderly population was included to reflect the societal perspective. However, the estimation for daily productivity was based on GDP per capita owing to the fact that information on the elderly’s salary was not available. From the third-party payer perspective, loss of productivity due to influenza and premature death was not included in the total costs or in the ICER calculations. Nevertheless, incorporating productivity loss costs in the present study would provide a detailed estimation of the indirect costs of QIV vaccination and influenza disease events. This allows policymakers to make informed decisions that not only improve public health outcomes but also contribute to economic well-being and societal development.The developed model had several potential limitations. First, due to insufficient national data, estimates of influenza hospitalization rates and GP consultation rates were based on published literature from other countries33. However, these rates were calculated and adjusted based on mortality rates estimated for Malaysia from a previous study32. Thereby, the estimates reflected to the Malaysia socio-economic and appropriate to apply for the Malaysian elderly population. While this may have affected outcome estimates, the sensitivity analysis shows that the effect was minimal in the base case. Second, we adjusted the vaccine efficacy data from previous literature to fit the age groups used in the model. Notably, the vaccine efficacy did have an impact in the study model, as shown in the sensitivity analysis. However, most important finding of the study was that QIVs were effective for preventing death and improve quality of life in the elderly. It was presumed that the influenza vaccination efficacy (IVE) was equivalent for influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2); a similar assumption was made by a previous study35. In our case, this assumption should not have impacted the evaluation of QIV when compared to no vaccination. Finally, due to limited data availability, the value for QALY lost due to influenza was assumed to be the same as a study done in the UK30. This was the most reliable data conducted on the elderly patient and appropriate to apply to the Malaysian population since there was no such data available in Asia and neighboring countries. The value was also comparable with another study conducted in Spain whereby QALY lost in the elderly aged 65 years and above was at 0.006147. The application of disutility value from UK and other high-income countries was also utilized by the Korean and Thailand studies21,48. Nevertheless, the multiple-one-way sensitivity analysis also demonstrated this parameter had limited impact on the ICER result. The utility score from EQ 5D has not yet been established for Malaysian population. For this reason, the EQ VAS was used as an alternative to the EQ-5D for measuring health-related utility norms for elderly population in this study. The EQ VAS is a vertical visual analog scale where respondents rate their current health state on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the worst health imaginable and 100 representing the best health imaginable. This provides a direct measure of the respondent’s overall perception of their health status.This study is likely to be the first study in Malaysia that has conducted a comprehensive analysis of influenza vaccination strategy in the elderly in terms of cost and health outcomes. The existing guideline for economic evaluation study was established by the Ministry of Health Malaysia, provide a structured framework for conducting economic assessments of healthcare interventions and technologies49. This study complied to the guideline to ensure that cost-effectiveness analysis is conducted systematically, transparently, and consistently, enabling policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers to make informed decisions about resource allocation on influenza immunization program in the elderly population in Malaysia. Our study conclusively demonstrates that the implementation of an influenza vaccination program in the elderly population is notably cost-effective, aligning with guidelines that deem interventions costing less than one GDP as having a higher probability of being considered for funding49. Based on the findings, we put forth recommendations for the Ministry of Health (MOH) to incorporate an influenza immunization program for the elderly into the Malaysia’s National Immunization Program.ConclusionsInfluenza-related complications are more common in people over the age of 65. Moreover, they were demonstrated to be particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic, thus underscoring the need to increase immunogenicity and avoid premature death in this high-risk group with effective influenza vaccines. This economic model suggested that although QIV would incur higher costs, it led to the highest QALYs gained. Our study provides compelling evidence of the benefits of influenza vaccination program, including its potential to reduce disease burden, improve public health, and save healthcare costs. It is apparent that influenza vaccination is the dominant strategy when considering all health outcome consequences in this assessment. Hence, compared to no-vaccination, QIV would reduce the burden of managing influenzas especially among the elderly.

Toggle navigation Strategic Objectives Main Content The overarching vision of the NIVMS is supported by three strategic objectives that align with the four policy objectives from the EO (see Annex A: NIVMS Strategic Objectives Crosswalk to EO 13887 for additional information). The associated objectives for each strategic objective will require dedicated and focused attention over the next ten years. Strategic Objective 1: Strengthen and Diversify Influenza Vaccine Development, Manufacturing, and Supply Chain Today, the majority of influenza vaccines are produced in chicken eggs — a process that takes up to nine months to develop and manufacture a vaccine — thus limiting the vaccine’s utility for early pandemic control. Moreover, growing the virus in eggs can inadvertently introduce mutations that may potentially render the final vaccine less effective. Nearly 50 percent of egg-based influenza vaccines are manufactured overseas; insufficient domestic production capacities introduces risks that could hamper our ability to address both seasonal and pandemic influenza. Alternative manufacturing techniques, including those derived from cell-based, recombinant and other synthetic technologies, have a relatively shorter manufacturing time and do not rely on a supply chain of eggs. Therefore, they have the potential to accelerate the availability of both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines, and could also allow for vaccines that more closely match circulating influenza strains. However, currently these new technologies are significantly more costly than production in eggs,5 and the current domestic enterprise for manufacturing these types of vaccines is not sufficient for continuous, large-scale manufacturing. It is a priority for the USG to reduce the time between declaration of an influenza pandemic and widespread distribution of vaccine sufficient to cover the United States’ population. To this end, the USG is committed to delivering first doses of a finished vaccine within 12 weeks.6 Therefore, it is imperative for the USG to build and maintain national sources of raw materials to ensure a resilient supply chain. Fundamental to influenza preparedness is continuous surveillance and virus characterization to inform vaccine composition and development. For this reason, it is critical to expand global influenza surveillance capacity. Finally, investments in innovative antigen and adjuvant selection strategies could improve the effectiveness of both egg-based and novel vaccine technologies, ultimately enhancing the scale, quality, and efficiency of manufacturing processes. Objectives Objective 1.1: Partner with manufacturers and other private sector stakeholders to promote the development and production of non-egg based influenza vaccines that are safe and effective in all populations. Objective 1.2: Develop and implement a sustainable investment strategy with the private sector that allows flexibility in financing for advanced development, licensure, and manufacturing of current and promising new vaccine candidates and vaccine production platforms. Objective 1.3: Sustain, leverage, and expand current domestic manufacturing capacities to transition to faster and more scalable vaccine production platforms. Objective 1.4: Increase and sustain domestic seasonal influenza vaccine production capacity using alternative technologies that can be leveraged for pandemic response to deliver first doses of a finished vaccine within 12 weeks of an influenza pandemic declaration. ↑ Strategic Objective 2: Promote Innovative Approaches and Use of New Technologies to Detect, Prevent, and Respond to Influenza Current influenza vaccines are designed to protect against the three to four influenza virus strains most likely to spread and cause illness during a given influenza season. Since influenza viruses are constantly evolving, current influenza vaccine composition must be reviewed and updated each year. It is also critically important to identify and assess the pre-pandemic potential of viruses. A “universal” influenza vaccine, one that provides robust, long lasting protection against multiple subtypes of influenza, would be the most effective MCM to reduce morbidity and mortality from seasonal and pandemic influenza infections. Currently, there is a promising pipeline of cross-protective vaccine candidates entering into clinical trials, underpinned by research that builds on our understanding of immune protection against influenza viruses. Since a universal vaccine is likely years away, it is critical that the USG continues to support improvements to vaccines using existing technologies and support complementary MCMs such as antiviral drugs, other therapeutics, and diagnostic tests. Targeted USG investments and incentives are needed to stimulate advances in science and discovery and to translate these advances into innovations. Therefore, the USG should support traditional and non-traditional partnerships to accelerate the development, licensure and domestic manufacturing capacity of transformative vaccine platforms; antigens, adjuvants, and other vaccine components; therapeutics; devices (e.g., respirators, ventilators); diagnostics; and other MCMs. As influenza MCMs are being developed, it is important to ensure coverage of children, older adults, and other at-risk individuals. Moreover, it is critical to enhance federal and state capabilities to collect, analyze, and share real-time data on pandemic and seasonal influenza threats. These data are critical for coordinated public health response, vaccine development, and effective use of all MCMs. Objectives Objective 2.1: Promote innovative approaches to enhance domestic and global surveillance, characterize seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, and monitor vaccine effectiveness and safety. Objective 2.2: Improve influenza vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics using an aligned and integrated research agenda across government agencies, the private sector, and academic institutions to facilitate the transition to alternative technologies. Objective 2.3: Apply the full range of regulatory authorities and expedited programs to promote the licensure of new influenza vaccine candidates and the approval of other relevant MCMs. Objective 2.4: Advance the development of a universal influenza vaccine that provides robust, long-lasting protection against multiple subtypes of influenza and is suitable for all populations. ↑ Strategic Objective 3: Increase Influenza Vaccine Access and Coverage Across All Populations The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone six months of age and older (with rare exception). Despite these recommendations, seasonal influenza vaccination rates in the United States are far from ideal – about 45 percent of adults and about 62 percent of children were vaccinated during the 2018-19 influenza season.7 There are a number of factors contributing to these low vaccination rates, including lack of public trust, vaccine misconceptions, and lack of access to vaccines. To address these contributing factors, it is imperative that the USG and its partners provide consistent and harmonized communications about the benefits of influenza immunization across all populations and promote increased access to influenza vaccination to improve immunization coverage. Objectives Objective 3.1: Increase and expedite access to influenza vaccines across all recommended populations. Objective 3.2: Improve the public’s understanding of influenza risk, as well as confidence in vaccine safety and effectiveness, through evidence-based messaging. Objective 3.3: Promote influenza immunization across recommended populations. Objective 3.4: Improve existing methods and develop alternative methods for influenza vaccine administration. Objective 3.5: Improve capabilities and capacity for management and tracking of influenza vaccination. 5 Council of Economic Advisers (CEA).

You may get flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines at the same visit, making it easier to stay up to date with CDC recommendations. If you choose to get your vaccines at different visits, there is no minimum waiting period between vaccines. Summary What CDC knows Some people may prefer to get their recommended flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines at the same time. You should consider getting these vaccines at the same time if making multiple visits to get additional vaccines would be difficult for you. What CDC is doing CDC has reviewed the available scientific evidence and concluded that people may get flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines at the same visit. Getting multiple vaccines at the same time is safe For some people, getting all of your recommended vaccines at a single appointment (often called coadministration) is the easiest way to stay up to date. The good news is that you may be able to get the flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines at the same time. Scientific studies during the last three years indicate that it is safe to get both a flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same visit. Coadministration of flu vaccines and the new RSV vaccines was also found to be safe in clinical trials. While there is no clinical trial data on getting all three vaccines at the same time, CDC is continuing to monitor safety of RSV vaccines, as it does for all vaccines. Getting multiple vaccines at the same visit may increase the risk of some side effects from vaccination. In one study, people were slightly more likely to have side effects when an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was given along with a flu vaccine compared to people who got a COVID-19 vaccine alone. In clinical trials, people were slightly more likely to have side effects when flu and RSV vaccines were coadministered. When side effects do occur, they are typically mild to moderate, like arm pain, swelling, headache, and fatigue. These side effects are usually short-lived. For people at higher risk of becoming seriously sick from flu, COVID-19, or RSV, the benefits of timely protection likely outweigh the possible risks of increased side effects. There is no minimum waiting period between getting each vaccine For people who prefer to get their recommended flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines at different visits, you don't need to wait a specific amount of time after the previous vaccine to get your next one. If you are sick with a moderate or severe acute illness, you should wait until you recover to get vaccinated. If you have recently had COVID-19, you may choose to delay your next COVID-19 vaccine until three months after your illness, when immunity typically begins to wane. Actions for the Public Whether you choose to get flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines at the same visit or at separate visits, the most important thing is that you get all vaccines recommended for you to protect yourself against these three potentially serious illnesses this fall and winter. Consider getting recommended flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines at the same visit if you may not be able to return to your provider, especially if you are at higher risk of getting seriously sick from flu, COVID-19, or RSV. Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions about getting your vaccines during a single visit. Use vaccines.gov to find flu and COVID-19 vaccines. If you are pregnant or the parent of an infant, talk to your healthcare provider about where you can find an RSV immunization to protect your baby from severe RSV illness. If you are 60 years or older, talk to your healthcare provider about whether RSV vaccination is right for you, and if so, where to get an RSV vaccine in your area.

Influenza—more commonly known as the flu—is a respiratory virus that can infect people year-round. Flu season, or when there's an uptick in cases, is usually during the fall and winter months in the United States. The flu season peak changes from year to year and depends on your location, but it typically occurs between December and February. About 8% of people in the United States get sick each flu season. One of the best ways to prevent the flu is to get your annual flu shot. Read on to learn when flu season occurs and peaks and how it affects the timing of your flu shot. Hiraman / Getty Images When Does Flu Season Begin and End? The exact timing of when flu season begins and ends depends on where you live, Alicia Budd, MPH, an epidemiologist in the Influenza Division at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told Health. For example, flu activity generally begins to increase in October and lasts until May in the United States. "The [CDC] watches flu activity year-round, and when certain key indicators increase beyond a certain point, the season is said to have begun," said Budd. The timing of flu season is largely due to the low temperatures. Research has found that flu viruses spread efficiently in cold conditions. "The flu thrives in colder weather, so you will see it hit in areas of the country that have shorter summers and longer winters," Tania Mucci-Elliott, MD, an infectious disease allergist and immunologist at NYU Langone Health, told Health. You Can Get the Flu Twice in One Season What Is Peak Flu Season? Flu season can have peaks of activity and usually varies each year and depends on your location. According to the CDC, flu season most often peaks between December to February. The CDC determines peak flu season by looking at the month with the highest percentage of respiratory specimens that test positive for the flu. When Is Flu Season in Other Parts of the World? Flu season looks different in other parts of the world. In the Southern Hemisphere (i.e., South America, parts of Africa, Australia, and Antarctica), flu season is generally opposite of what it is in the Northern Hemisphere (i.e., North America, Europe, and most of Asia). The flu season typically lasts from April to September in the Southern Hemisphere. The flu season in other parts of the world usually does not predict flu season in the Southern Hemisphere. Different flu viruses and immunity levels might occur in the United States. What Other Illnesses Peak During Flu Season? Other respiratory illnesses commonly circulate during the fall and winter months. The flu, along with other viruses, also tend to thrive during that time because people crowd indoors for long periods of time. That allows viruses to pass easily from person to person. Illness that peak during flu season include: Bronchitis: Results in inflammation of the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs (bronchial tubes) Common cold: Causes symptoms like a runny or stuffy nose, coughing, and sneezing COVID-19: Involves mild to severe symptoms like a fever, coughing, and shortness of breath Pneumonia: Causes fluid or pus to fill the air sacs in your lungs Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): Brings about cold-like symptoms, most commonly in young children Who’s at Greater Risk of Getting the Flu? Anyone can get the flu and other respiratory infections like COVID and RSV. Still, some people are likelier to get sick and develop complications from those illnesses. Factors that increase your risk of getting very sick from the flu and other respiratory infections include: Age: Young children and older adults have weaker immune systems than others. Children younger than 5 also have small lungs and airways, which increases their risk of complications. Certain health conditions: This includes chronic heart, lung, and kidney illnesses, diabetes, and obesity. Those illnesses place stress on your body, making it difficult to get rid of an infection. Pregnancy: Changes in your immune system and stress on your body make it harder than usual to fight off an infection. Weak immune system: This includes illnesses or medicines (e.g., chemotherapy for cancer) that suppress your immune defenses. Tips for Staying Healthy There are several ways to stay healthy and prevent the flu. One of the best ways to protect yourself and your loved ones from the flu is to get an annual flu vaccine, said Budd. The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine each year. Hygiene tips that help prevent the flu include: Cover your mouth and nose with the crook of your elbow or a tissue when you cough and sneeze.Regularly wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water. Use hand sanitizer with at least 60% if soap and water are unavailable.Stay home if you have flu symptoms.Avoid coming into contact with people who are sick.Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that people regularly touch. What Month Is the Best Time To Get a Flu Shot? It's essential that you get a flu vaccine before the illness begins to spread in your community, said Dr. Mucci-Elliott. September and October are generally good times to get the flu vaccine. "October is the best time. If you get it too early and the season lasts long, you may not remain protected for the duration of the season," said Dr. Mucci-Elliott. The CDC still advises vaccination if you do not get a flu vaccine during that time. Flu cases most commonly peak later in the season and at the start of the new year. "While it's ideal to be vaccinated by the end of October, flu vaccination is beneficial anytime flu viruses are spreading or may still spread," said Budd. "Even into January or later because the flu most commonly peaks in February, and significant activity can continue into May." How Long Does It Take for the Flu Shot To Be Effective? A Quick Review Flu season starts in October, peaks from December to February, and lasts until May in the United States. Anyone can get the flu, but certain age groups, pregnant people, and those with certain illnesses or weak immune systems are likelier than others. One of the best ways to prevent the flu is to get your annual flu shot in September or October before the illness becomes prevalent. Other ways to protect yourself and your loved ones are to cover your coughs and sneezes, regularly wash your hands, and stay home if you are sick. FAQs Frequently Asked Questions 1. Can you get flu in summer? The flu circulates year-round, so you can get it in the summer, though it's uncommon. Your symptoms might indicate other respiratory illnesses like a cold or COVID. The COVID pandemic disrupted usual flu season patterns, causing unusually high flu cases during the summer months. 2. Why is there a flu season and not year-round? You can get the flu year-round. Still, there's an uptick in cases during the fall and winter months, known as the flu season. The cold temperatures make it easier for flu viruses to spread. People also spend a lot of time indoors when it's cold outside. That makes it easy for viruses to spread from person to person. 3. What countries are most affected by the flu? The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates one billion cases of the flu per year. Research has found that the United States, China, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Norway had the highest overall burden of flu between 2017 and 2019.Still, the WHO reports that there are about 290,000–650,000 deaths from the flu yearly. Nearly 99% of those deaths occur in developing countries. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

In addition to the annual influenza virus, the ongoing concern of COVID-19 continues to be a critical health issue. Staying healthy this flu season requires a combination of preventative measures and timely medical intervention.Getting a flu shot is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and your community from influenza. The vaccine helps your immune system recognize and fight the virus, preventing or reducing the severity of symptoms and preventing complications. It's recommended for everyone, especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly, young children, pregnant women, and those with underlying health conditions.In addition to the flu shot, receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and subsequent booster shots is crucial. COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has proven to be a highly contagious and sometimes severe illness. Vaccination not only reduces the risk of infection but also lowers the chances of severe illness, hospitalization, and death.Visit a Public Health community flu clinic to get this year's flu vaccine and COVID booster. Clinic dates and locations can be found on the Public Health website. Staying healthy during flu season starts with practicing good hygiene:Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in public places.Use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.Wearing masks, especially in crowded or indoor settings, can significantly reduce the transmission of both the flu and COVID-19.Avoid touching your face: your eyes, nose, and mouth are entry points for viruses. Try to refrain from touching them unless you've just washed your hands.Get regular exercise, eat a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and ensure you're getting enough sleep.Stay updated with information from reliable sources like the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They provide essential guidance on how to protect yourself and others.Flu season, coupled with the ongoing cases of COVID-19, demands a proactive approach to safeguarding our health. By following recommended preventive measures, getting vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19, we can collectively reduce the impact of these illnesses on individuals and communities. Remember, your health is in your hands, and by taking these steps, you're not only protecting yourself but also those around you. Stay safe, stay informed, and stay healthy!

From Talk Business & Politics: Avian influenza has infiltrated at least one farm in Arkansas, according to the Arkansas Department of Agriculture. Testing has confirmed a case on a poultry farm in Madison County.Following an investigation by the Arkansas Department of Agriculture’s Livestock and Poultry Division in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Veterinary Services, the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed poultry from this farm have tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI).There is no public health concern, according to officials, and avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat. The Arkansas Department of Agriculture and partner agencies, including the USDA, are working to contain the situation. Actions include sampling and quarantining nearby poultry flocks.“We have taken immediate action to contain this disease and will continue to work with poultry growers, the industry, and our laboratory partners to protect against its spread,” said Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture Wes Ward. “Arkansas poultry is safe to eat, and consumers can be confident in the safety of their food.”“The farm is under quarantine to stop the spread of avian influenza to other flocks in the state,” said Arkansas State Veterinarian John Nilz.Under the provisions of the Poultry Disease and Flock Condemnation Rule poultry and waterfowl cannot be exhibited in an affected area. Poultry and waterfowl cannot be moved within an impacted area, and none can be sold, bartered, traded, auctioned, or given away at swap meets, auctions, flea markets or other similar events and locations.An affected area is an area determined by the Arkansas Department of Agriculture of approximately 25 miles surrounding a flock with a confirmed case of HPAI. The boundaries of the affected area for the confirmed case in Madison County are Gateway (northernmost), Osage (easternmost), Combs (southernmost), and Harmon (westernmost).

Globally, seasonal flu epidemics are estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people every year. Despite having known about influenza for almost a century and knowing that pandemic influenza remains one of the greatest threats to human health, we still do not have effective drugs for treating people with severe influenza. Until now, few large-scale clinical trials have evaluated treatments for patients hospitalised with influenza. However, the features of the RECOVERY trial that made it such a success against COVID-19 – including its streamlined design, large scale, and practical integration into routine healthcare – make it well-placed to also improve the care of severe influenza patients. Sir Peter Horby, Moh Family Foundation Professor of Emerging Infectious and Global Health in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, and Joint Chief Investigator for the RECOVERY trial, said ‘As well as being the greatest pandemic risk, influenza remains a serious annual scourge. In a bad year, as many as 25,000 people in the UK die as a result of influenza. Yet we have no treatments that have been proven to improve outcomes in hospitalised patients. By including influenza in the RECOVERY trial, we have the opportunity to change this and find new treatments for this persistent menace.’ As well as in the UK, the study will be open to patients hospitalised with confirmed influenza in selected hospital sites in France, Italy and the Netherlands through a new partnership between the University of Oxford and Ecraid (the European Clinical Research Alliance on Infectious Diseases). It will also be open to patients in hospitals that have previously participated in RECOVERY in Asia (India, Indonesia, Nepal and Vietnam) and Africa (Ghana and South Africa). Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either the usual standard of care or the usual standard of care plus at least one of the treatments in the trial. RECOVERY will investigate the following drugs initially: Oseltamivir, an antiviral medicine (known as Tamiflu) that has been shown to provide benefit in mild influenza; Baloxavir marboxil, an antiviral medicine (known as Xofluza) that has been licensed to treat uncomplicated, mild influenza; Low dose corticosteroids that have been shown to benefit some patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Sir Martin Landray, Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at Oxford Population Health and Joint Chief Investigator for RECOVERY, said ‘RECOVERY was designed to provide a robust test of possible treatments for COVID-19 whilst keeping the burden on hospital staff and the health system to a minimum. This approach led to the discovery of effective treatments for COVID-19, such as dexamethasone, which have now saved hundreds of thousands of lives around the world. We are now expanding this approach to tackle the long-term challenge of influenza.’ The 2022–2023 influenza season marked the return of influenza virus activity at almost pre-pandemic levels in the EU/EEA countries, highlighting an urgent need for assessment of flu treatments. RECOVERY’s assessment of treatments for flu is funded by Flu Lab, based in the United States. Through grants and investments, Flu Lab supports efforts to advance innovative solutions to persistent problems in the prevention and treatment of influenza.

(WBMA) — More than 344,000 birds were killed in Alabama due to the confirmation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the animals.TheAlabama Department of Agriculture and Industries (ADAI) and USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) said 47,900 birds on a pullet farm in Marshall County were depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease.ADAI said all poultry within a 10-kilometer radius (6.2 miles) of the site are being tested and monitored. Currently, no other flocks have experienced an increase in mortality.SEE ALSO:Biotech may be new economic identity of central Alabama, dubbed 'new steel of Birmingham'SEE ALSO:USDA Forest Service places public fire restrictions in Alabama's national forestsLast week, ADAI said it confirmed the disease in a commercial upland gamebird farm in Chilton County.ADAI said all poultry (pheasants, quail, ducks and chukars) on this premise will be depopulated by the end of the week. A total of 296,500 birds were affected there.As part of existing avian influenza response plans, ADAI said federal and state partners are working on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The department added that the United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world. ADAI said it and USDA are actively monitoring for the disease in commercial poultry operations, backyard flocks, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.ADAI said the disease is considered low risk to human health according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control but is highly contagious to other birds, including commercial and backyard flocks of poultry. While the virus is also not considered a food safety threat, infected birds do not enter the food supply.ADAI Commissioner Rick Pate and State Veterinarian Dr. Tony Frazier released the following statement, “It is critical for commercial and backyard poultry operations to remain alert and closely monitor the health of their poultry. The HPAI infected flock in Marshall County reinforces the need to continue following strict biosecurity measures, including keeping birds enclosed without access to wild birds or other domestic flocks.”HPAI symptoms include:Sudden increase in bird deaths in your flockSneezing, gasping for air, coughing and nasal dischargeWatery and green diarrheaLack of energy and poor appetiteDrop in egg production or soft or thin-shelled, misshaped eggsSwelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles, and hocksPurple discoloration of the wattles, comb and legsRuffled feathers, listlessness and lethargyADAI urges the commercial poultry industry and backyard flock owners to increase biosecurity measures to protect their operations from HPAI.Biosecurity measures can include:Cleaning vehicles and equipmentLimiting unnecessary visitorsSanitizing shoes in clean foot bathsChanging clothes upon contact with birds and morePeople should avoid contact with sick/dead poultry or wildlife. If contact occurs, wash your hands and change clothing before having any contact with poultry and wild birds.
