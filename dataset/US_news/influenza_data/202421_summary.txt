- Mice administered raw milk samples from dairy cows infected with H5N1 influenza experienced high virus levels in their respiratory organs and lower virus levels in other vital organs.
- Consumption of raw milk by animals poses a risk for H5N1 infection and raises questions about its potential risk in humans.
- H5N1 influenza viruses have been circulating since 2003, primarily affecting wild birds and poultry with about 900 human cases, usually from close contact with infected birds.
- In recent years, HPAI H5N1 has spread to more than 50 animal species, including dairy cows in the United States.
- The risk of H5N1 infection from consuming raw milk was assessed through mice studies, which showed signs of illness and high virus levels in their respiratory organs.
- Researchers also tested the inactivation of H5N1 virus in raw milk at different temperatures and time intervals.
