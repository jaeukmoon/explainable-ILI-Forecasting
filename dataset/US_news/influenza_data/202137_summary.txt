Antigenic characterization of influenza viruses is crucial for monitoring their evolution and selecting appropriate vaccine strains. Recent A/H3N2 influenza viruses have altered receptor specificities and have lost the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes, making antigenic characterization challenging. These viruses have compensated for decreased binding to the prototypic human receptor by recognizing α2,6-sialosides on extended LacNAc moieties. The absence of extended glycans on erythrocytes explains the lack of agglutination by recent A/H3N2 viruses. By using a glycan remodeling approach, functional receptors can be installed on erythrocytes, enabling the antigenic characterization of recent A/H3N2 viruses. Computational analysis reveals that mutations in the HA protein of these viruses have reoriented the receptor binding site. This study provides insights into the evolution and antigenic variation of A/H3N2 influenza viruses and suggests a method for antigenic characterization.
