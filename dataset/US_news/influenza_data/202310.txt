On infection, immune cells release a ‘storm’ of cytokines and other mediators, many of which are detected by neurons3,4; yet, the responding neural circuits and neuro–immune interaction mechanisms that evoke sickness behaviour during naturalistic infections remain unclear. Over-the-counter medications such as aspirin and ibuprofen are widely used to alleviate sickness and act by blocking prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis5. A leading model is that PGE2 crosses the blood–brain barrier and directly engages hypothalamic neurons2. Here, using genetic tools that broadly cover a peripheral sensory neuron atlas, we instead identified a small population of PGE2-detecting glossopharyngeal sensory neurons (petrosal GABRA1 neurons) that are essential for influenza-induced sickness behaviour in mice. Ablating petrosal GABRA1 neurons or targeted knockout of PGE2 receptor 3 (EP3) in these neurons eliminates influenza-induced decreases in food intake, water intake and mobility during early-stage infection and improves survival. Genetically guided anatomical mapping revealed that petrosal GABRA1 neurons project to mucosal regions of the nasopharynx with increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 after infection, and also display a specific axonal targeting pattern in the brainstem. Together, these findings reveal a primary airway-to-brain sensory pathway that detects locally produced prostaglandins and mediates systemic sickness responses to respiratory virus infection.

Feeling sick can be profoundly debilitating, and most people are sick several times a year. The sensation of sickness represents a neural response to infection that may provide a highly coordinated and adaptive strategy to promote recovery1,2. Animals infected with various pathogens display common behavioural and physiological responses that can include fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, headache and pain, mood changes and decreased socialization, suggesting a common sickness state involving shared neural circuits2,7. In addition to common symptoms, other sickness responses are tailored to the site of infection; for example, some respiratory infections induce cough, congestion and bronchoconstriction, whereas some gut infections induce nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. Infection-specific behavioural responses suggest multiple body–brain communication pathways for pathogen detection.Several cytokines and immune mediators can induce sickness behaviour when administered in isolation, including interleukins, interferons, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and eicosanoids1,2,4,8. These and other cytokines, as well as pathogen-derived factors such as lipopolysaccharide, bacterial toxins and formyl peptides, can activate an assortment of central and/or peripheral sensory neurons4,9. Together, these observations raise the possibility that there are many pathways for neuro–immune crosstalk, although it is unclear when or whether each of these pathways is engaged during naturalistic infections.Chemicals such as salicylic acid from willow bark, aspirin and ibuprofen block biosynthesis of key infection-induced lipid mediators through inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes, and have provided a historically effective approach to manage sickness symptoms5,10. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a key cyclooxygenase-dependent metabolite that evokes sickness behaviour, and knockout of other enzymes downstream of cyclooxygenase in the PGE2 biosynthesis pathway also ameliorates sickness responses11. PGE2 is detected by a small subfamily of 4 G-protein-coupled receptors (EP1–EP4)12, and some but not all pyrogen-induced sickness responses are thought to be mediated by the EP3 receptor2. The EP3 receptor is expressed in various brain regions, including the hypothalamus and circumventricular organs as well as peripheral neurons, immune cells and many other cell types12,13. Region-specific knockout of the EP3 receptor in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) of the hypothalamus diminished lipopolysaccharide-induced fever responses14, with PGE2 receptors in other areas reportedly being relevant for effects on arousal and feeding2. These and other findings have led to several possible models in which (1) PGE2 can directly cross the blood–brain barrier owing to its hydrophobicity, (2) PGE2 can be detected or enter the brain at circumventricular organs, and/or (3) PGE2 can be synthesized in the brain itself2,15,16. Central PGE2 could then activate a distributed neural network, with different receptive brain regions such as the MnPO evoking particular aspects of a characteristic sickness response17.The roles of prostaglandin receptors in peripheral neurons have remained unclear, and furthermore, we reasoned that exogenous application of chemically defined pyrogens may produce a systemic inflammatory response, whereas natural infections in different locations and of varying intensities may instead trigger local neuro–immune response pathways that have remained unexplored.Influenza causes sickness through EP3We developed a mouse model to characterize the neuronal mechanisms underlying influenza-induced sickness behaviour. Mice were infected by intranasal administration of influenza A virus PR/8/34 (H1N1), and monitored for characteristic sickness responses over the subsequent 10–20 days. Influenza infection decreased food intake, water intake, locomotion, body weight and survival in wild-type mice. Higher titres of virus inoculum increased the extent of sickness behaviour, with the most severe phenotypes arising six-to-seven days after infection (Fig. 1a). Influenza infection increased PGE2 levels in both plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) over a similar time frame, as measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). PGE2 administration also acutely inhibited food intake (Extended Data Fig. 2a), and fibre photometry measurements showed decreased activity of hypothalamic neurons expressing agouti-related peptide (AGRP) (Extended Data Fig. 2c), consistent with a decreased motivation to eat, rather than solely a physical inability to eat. We also observed a hypothermic response to influenza infection (Extended Data Fig. 3a), consistent with previous observations in mice18. Administration of ibuprofen (1 mg ml−1 in drinking water, ad libitum) or aspirin (20 mg kg−1, daily intraperitoneal injection) to influenza-infected mice decreased plasma PGE2 levels, restored feeding, water intake and body weight, and promoted survival from infection (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Figs. 1b and 3b). Ibuprofen- and aspirin-treated mice retained low-level decreases in feeding, drinking and motility without elevated PGE2, raising the possibility that other neuro–immune communication pathways might also contribute to the behavioural responses. Yet, ibuprofen and aspirin substantially decreased influenza-induced sickness behaviour, consistent with a key role for cyclooxygenase-2 metabolites in neuro–immune crosstalk.Fig. 1: Influenza infection induces multiple sickness symptoms through the EP3 receptor.a, Mice were infected intranasally with 25 μl of influenza A virus at low (105 EID50 ml−1), medium (106 EID50 ml−1) or high (107 EID50 ml−1) dose and food intake, water intake, motility and body weight were subsequently monitored daily. EID50 is the 50% egg infective dose. Data are mean ± s.e.m.; n = 6 mice per group. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test compared with vehicle control. Food intake: P = 0.0048 (low), P < 0.0001 (medium), P < 0.0001 (high). Water intake: P = 0.8185 (low), P < 0.0001 (medium), P < 0.0001 (high). Motility: P = 0.5231 (low), P < 0.0001 (medium), P < 0.0001 (high). Body weight: P = 0.0002 (low), P < 0.0001 (medium), P < 0.0001 (high). Survival: P = 0.3173 (low), P = 0.0185 (medium), P = 0.0007 (high). b, Mice were infected with influenza A virus (all infections are with 106 EID50 ml−1 unless otherwise indicated), given drinking water with or without 1 mg ml−1 ibuprofen, and monitored as indicated. Data are mean ± s.e.m.; n = 6 mice per group. Food intake: P < 0.0001; water intake: P = 0.0001; motility: P = 0.0001; body weight: P < 0.0001; survival: P = 0.0295. c, Mice were infected with influenza A virus, injected daily (intraperitoneal injection, 1 mg kg−1) with antagonists for EP1 (SC-51322), EP2 (PF-04418948), EP3 (DG-041) or EP4 (ONO-AE3-208), or vehicle alone, and monitored as indicated. Data are mean ± s.e.m.; n = 10 mice for vehicle groups; n = 8 mice for all others. For EP3 antagonist—food intake: P < 0.0001; water intake: P < 0.0001; motility: P < 0.0001; body weight: P = 0.0002; survival: P = 0.0094. b,c, Two-tailed unpaired t-test, with comparisons between groups treated with ibuprofen or EP3 antagonist and vehicle in c. Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test for survival analyses; for behavioural or physiological changes, a mean daily change in behaviour (days 1–10 after infection or survival) was obtained for each mouse, and then used for comparisons across experimental groups (for more information see Extended Data Fig. 1a). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005, ***P<0.0005; NS, not significant.Source dataFull size imageRoles for multiple prostaglandin receptors have been proposed in sickness behaviours2,19. We administered selective antagonists for each PGE2 receptor daily after influenza infection, and measured different aspects of sickness behaviour. The EP3 receptor antagonist DG-041 effectively blocked influenza-induced sickness in each parameter measured and also promoted survival (Fig. 1c), with an effect magnitude similar to that of ibuprofen and aspirin. By contrast, antagonism of the EP1, EP2 or EP4 receptors had no effect on any measured parameter. The EP3-selective agonist sulprostone had the opposite effect of inhibiting food intake (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Thus, mice display characteristic behavioural changes to influenza virus infection through the action of PGE2 on EP3 receptors.Glossopharyngeal neurons and sicknessThe EP3 receptor is expressed in several classes of central and peripheral neurons. To determine the key site of EP3 receptor action in influenza-induced sickness, we obtained mice with an allele (Ptger3flox) for Cre-dependent knockout of the Ptger3 gene14, which encodes the EP3 receptor. We then crossed Ptger3flox mice with either Nestin-cre or Advillin-creER mice, which target Cre recombinase to most central or peripheral neurons20,21, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4a), and measured influenza-induced sickness behaviours. Advillin-creER; Ptger3flox mice were treated with tamoxifen to induce Cre-mediated recombination at least one week before virus administration; prior tamoxifen treatment of control mice did not affect the subsequent behavioural responses to influenza infection (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Influenza-induced decreases in feeding, drinking, movement, body weight and survival were attenuated in Advillin-creER; Ptger3flox mice (Fig. 2b), with effect magnitudes similar to ibuprofen treatment, but persisted in Nestin-cre; Ptger3flox mice (Fig. 2a). Similar effects of Ptger3 gene deletion on sickness behaviour were observed when lower, less lethal doses of influenza virus were used (Extended Data Fig. 5). Mice with attenuated sickness behaviour displayed a similar recovery time, as normal feeding, drinking and motility were observed by about two weeks after infection in all experimental groups. These observations indicated that influenza induces sickness responses through PGE2 action on peripheral sensory neurons.Fig. 2: Peripheral EP3 receptor is required for influenza-induced sickness.a,b, Nestin-cre; Ptger3flox (a), Advillin-creER; Ptger3flox mice (b) or Ptger3flox (a,b) mice were infected with influenza A virus and monitored as indicated. Data are mean ± s.e.m.; n = 8 mice (Ptger3flox), n = 6 mice (Nestin-cre and Advillin-creER). Two-tailed unpaired t-test as detailed in Fig. 1 for behaviour or physiology analyses; log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test for survival analysis. a, Food intake: P = 0.0126; water intake: P = 0.1006; motility: P = 0.0701; body weight: P = 0.9361; survival: P = 0.7735. b, Food intake: P = 0.0004; water intake: P = 0.0004; motility: P < 0.0001; body weight: P = 0.0004; survival: P = 0.0216. c, The NJP ganglia of Ptger3flox mice were injected bilaterally with AAV-cre, exposed to influenza A virus or saline and monitored as indicated. Data are mean ± s.e.m.; n = 8 mice per group. Ptger3flox, virus—food intake: P < 0.0001; water intake: P < 0.0001; motility: P < 0.0001; body weight: P < 0.0001; survival: P < 0.0001. Ptger3flox; AAV-cre, virus—Food intake: P < 0.0001; water intake: P < 0.0001; motility: P < 0.0001; body weight: P < 0.0001; survival: P = 0.0376. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test as detailed in Fig. 1 for behaviour or physiology analyses; log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test for survival analysis, with comparisons made between Ptger3flox, virus and Ptger3flox; AAV-cre, vehicle (red stars) or between Ptger3flox, virus and Ptger3flox; AAV-cre, virus (blue stars).Source dataFull size imageThe EP3 receptor is expressed in several classes of peripheral neurons marked in Advillin-creER mice, including vagal sensory neurons, glossopharyngeal sensory neurons, spinal sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia, and potentially in other neuron types20,22. Glossopharyngeal and vagal sensory neurons were considered primary candidates for the detection of respiratory pathogens as they account for most of the innervation in the upper and lower airways23. In mice, the soma of vagal (nodose and jugular) and glossopharyngeal (petrosal) sensory neurons are fused into a large superganglion on each side of the body23. We injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) with a constitutive cre allele (AAV-cre) bilaterally into both nodose–jugular–petrosal (NJP) ganglia of Ptger3flox mice. Effective knockout of Ptger3 in NJP ganglia was confirmed two weeks after AAV injection by RNA in situ hybridization (Extended Data Fig. 6). NJP ganglion-targeted Ptger3 knockout caused a marked attenuation of influenza-induced sickness behaviour (Fig. 2c). These findings indicate that influenza induces behavioural changes through EP3 receptor expressed on vagal and/or glossopharyngeal sensory afferents.Ptger3 is expressed in a subset of vagal and glossopharyngeal sensory neurons, as revealed by RNA in situ hybridization (Extended Data Fig. 6b) and analysis of single-cell transcriptome data (Fig. 3a). Single-cell RNA sequencing approaches revealed dozens of molecularly distinct NJP sensory neurons22,24,25. The highest Ptger3 expression was observed in 6 neuron clusters: J1, J2, J3, NP2, NP9 and NP26 (Fig. 3a), with J denoting jugular and NP denoting nodose–petrosal neurons. We crossed Ptger3flox mice to Piezo2-IRES-cre mice, in which J1, J2, J3 and other NJP neurons are labelled, and Phox2b-cre mice, in which NP2, NP9, NP26 and other NJP neurons are labelled. Influenza-induced sickness behaviours were attenuated in Phox2b-cre; Ptger3flox mice across a range of viral titres, but not in Piezo2-IRES-cre; Ptger3flox mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Figs. 7 and 8a), suggesting a role for either NP2, NP9 or NP26 neurons. To distinguish these neuron types, we next crossed Ptger3flox mice to Pdyn-IRES-cre, Oxtr-IRES-cre and Gabra1-IRES-cre mice, which display differential targeting of NP26, NP2 and NP9 neurons. Gabra1-IRES-cre; Ptger3flox mice displayed a marked attenuation of influenza-induced sickness behaviour similar to ibuprofen treatment, whereas no effect was observed in either Pdyn-IRES-cre; Ptger3flox or Oxtr-IRES-cre; Ptger3flox mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Gabra1-IRES-cre; Ptger3flox mice additionally displayed an attenuated hypothermia response to influenza infection (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We also tested a role for TRPV1 neurons since their deletion affects survival following bacterial lung infections that cause lethal pneumonia26. However, influenza-induced sickness behaviour was normal in Trpv1-IRES-cre; Ptger3flox mice (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c), and furthermore, GABRA1 neurons are predominantly Trpv1-negative. Thus, deletion of the EP3 receptor in a small subset of Gabra1-expressing peripheral sensory neurons (NP9 neurons) has a wide-ranging effect on behavioural responses to influenza infection.Fig. 3: Rare transcriptome-defined sensory neurons mediate influenza responses.a, A uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot derived from published single-cell transcriptome data of vagal and glossopharyngeal sensory ganglia22 showing expression of indicated genes (colour shows relative expression on a natural log scale). b, Cell types, as highlighted in a, express the indicated gene as well as Ptger3. Mice were infected with influenza A virus and monitored as indicated. Data are mean ± s.e.m.; n = 8 (Piezo2-IRES-cre), n = 6–8 (Phox2b-cre; 8 control and 6 Phox2b-cre), n = 6 (Pdyn-IRES-cre), n = 6 (Oxtr-IRES-cre) and n = 10 (Gabra1-IRES-cre) mice per group. Two-tailed unpaired t-test as detailed in Fig. 1 for behaviour or physiology analyses; log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test for survival analysis. Piezo2-IRES-cre—food intake: P = 0.2631; motility: P = 0.2680; body weight: P = 0.7925; survival: P = 0.4736. Phox2b-cre—food intake: P < 0.0001; motility: P < 0.0001; body weight: P = 0.0002; survival: P = 0.0181. Pdyn-IRES-cre—food intake: P = 0.4539; motility: P = 0.4946; body weight: P = 0.2675; survival: P = 0.7937; Oxtr-IRES-cre—food intake: P = 0.4786; motility: P = 0.6333; body weight: P = 0.3297; survival: P = 0.7121; Gabra1-IRES-cre—food intake: P = 0.0001; motility: P < 0.0001; body weight: P = 0.0004; survival: P = 0.0263.Source dataFull size imageNext, we examined how manipulations of sensory neurons affected viral transcript levels and cytokine production. Influenza infection induced PGE2 to similar levels in plasma and BALF of Gabra1-IRES-cre; Ptger3flox, Phox2b-cre; Ptger3flox, Advillin-creER; Ptger3flox and Ptger3flox mice (Extended Data Fig. 9a), consistent with changes in PGE2 detection rather than PGE2 synthesis underlying the observed behavioural differences. In control mice, viral transcript levels peaked three days after infection in the upper airways and five days after infection in the lungs. In Gabra1-IRES-cre; Ptger3flox mice, viral transcript levels were partially reduced in the upper airways and were decreased, delayed and persistent in the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Levels of interferon-gamma (IFNγ), TNF and interleukin 6 (IL-6) similarly peaked in BALF of control mice 5 days after infection, and were likewise decreased and delayed in Gabra1-IRES-cre; Ptger3flox mice (Extended Data Fig. 9c). These findings indicate that targeted EP3 receptor knockout in sensory neurons not only affects sickness behaviour, but also the immune response and the transition from upper to lower respiratory tract infection.We used a complementary approach involving diphtheria toxin-guided cell ablation to clarify a role for Gabra1-expressing vagal–glossopharyngeal sensory neurons in influenza-induced sickness, and rule out a role for other Gabra1 expression sites. Mouse cells are normally resistant to diphtheria toxin, but can be rendered sensitive by the expression of the human diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR). NJP ganglia of Gabra1-IRES-cre; lsl-DTR mice were bilaterally injected with diphtheria toxin (we term these Gabra1-ABLATE mice), resulting in highly efficient ablation of vagal and glossopharyngeal GABRA1 neurons (Fig. 4c). We previously demonstrated that this approach does not affect Cre-negative neurons in NJP ganglia, or remotely located Cre-positive neurons27. Gabra1-ABLATE mice displayed attenuated sickness responses to influenza infection that were similar to those in Gabra1-IRES-cre; Ptger3flox mice or ibuprofen-treated mice (Fig. 4a).Fig. 4: PGE2 acts via glossopharyngeal sensory neurons.a, Gabra1-IRES-cre; lsl-DTR mice were injected bilaterally in NJP ganglia with or without diphtheria toxin (DT) and then infected with influenza A virus and monitored as indicated. Data are mean ± s.e.m.; n = 8 mice per group. Food intake: P < 0.0001; water intake: P < 0.0001; motility: P < 0.0001; body weight: P = 0.0004; survival: P = 0.049. b, Wild-type mice with bilateral glossopharyngeal nerve transection surgery or sham surgery were infected with influenza A virus and monitored as indicated. Data are mean ± s.e.m.; n = 8 mice per group. Food intake: P < 0.0001; water intake: P < 0.0001; motility: P < 0.0001; body weight: P < 0.0001; P = 0.036. Two-tailed unpaired t-test as detailed in Fig. 1 for behaviour or physiology analysis; log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test for survival analysis. c, Immunostaining for DTR in whole-mount preparations of NJP ganglia four weeks after injection. Scale bars, 200 μm. d, Calcium transients evoked by PGE2 (1 μM) or KCl (150 mM) were imaged using Calbryte 520 AM in tdTomato-positive neurons acutely collected from NJP ganglia of Gabra1-IRES-cre; lsl-tdTomato mice. Scale bar, 10 μm. Images are representative of three technical replicates. AU, arbitrary units.Source dataFull size imageNP9 neurons lack expression of Hoxb4(ref. 22), and GABRA1 neurons are often clustered within NJP ganglia near the glossopharyngeal branch (Extended Data Fig. 10a), suggesting they comprise part of the glossopharyngeal nerve rather than the vagus nerve. Since diphtheria toxin injection similarly affected vagal and glossopharyngeal neurons, we distinguished the contributions from these nerves by transecting the glossopharyngeal nerve bilaterally while preserving the vagus nerve. Mice with bilateral glossopharyngeal nerve transection displayed a similar attenuation of influenza-induced sickness (Fig. 4b). PGE2 was previously shown to activate and/or induce transcriptional changes in spinal and vagal afferents28,29,30,31, so we tested whether GABRA1 neurons are also directly activated. We observed that PGE2 directly evoked calcium transients in GABRA1 neurons acutely cultured from NJP sensory ganglia of Gabra1-IRES-cre; lsl-tdTomato mice (Fig. 4d, 16 out of 26 or 61.5% of tdTomato-positive, KCl-responsive neurons). Thus, rare glossopharyngeal NP9 neurons detect the presence of a respiratory viral infection indirectly through the EP3 receptor and, in response, evoke a multi-pronged programme of sickness behaviour.A sensory arc from nasopharynx to brainGabra1-IRES-cre mice provide a valuable tool for visualizing scarce glossopharyngeal sensory neurons involved in neuro–immune crosstalk, so we used genetic mapping approaches to mark the peripheral and central projections of GABRA1 neurons (Fig. 5a). NJP ganglia of Gabra1-IRES-cre mice were injected with either an AAV containing a Cre-dependent reporter gene encoding tdTomato (AAV-flex-tdTomato) or alkaline phosphatase (AAV-flex-AP), as well as an AAV containing a Cre-independent reporter gene encoding GFP (AAV-GFP) to visualize the global NJP projection field. Fibres were then visualized in the airways and the brain.Fig. 5: GABRA1 neurons provide an airway–brain communication route.a, NJP ganglia of Gabra1-IRES-cre mice were injected bilaterally with Cre-independent AAV-GFP and Cre-dependent AAV-flex-tdTomato, and fluorescent axons were visualized (green: all NJP sensory axons; red: GABRA1 NJP axons) by immunohistochemistry for tdTomato and GFP in fixed coronal cryosections of mouse brainstem. Scale bar, 200 μm. b, NJP ganglia of Gabra1-IRES-cre mice were injected bilaterally with AAV-flex-tdTomato, and axons were visualized by immunostaining for tdTomato in fixed coronal cryosections of nasopharynx.

Top panel in part b created with BioRender.com.Source dataFull size imageCentrally, sensory neurons of the nodose and petrosal ganglia cross the skull and innervate brainstem regions that include the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and area postrema32, whereas jugular sensory neurons innervate the paratrigeminal nucleus33. Various Cre-defined vagal afferents target spatially restricted subregions of the NTS, with some but not all afferent types also accessing the area postrema24,34,35. The axons of NJP GABRA1 neurons were highly restricted in the lateral NTS (Fig. 5a), not observed in the area postrema, and remote from NTS locations targeted by axons of some other Cre-defined NJP neurons, such as gut-innervating neurons marked by expression of Gpr65 or Glp1r35. These findings further support a model for topographic organization in the brainstem36, with neurons relaying the presence of an airway infection spatially restricted from at least some other interoceptive inputs.In the periphery, labelled GABRA1 axons were observed in only a few internal organs known to receive vagal and glossopharyngeal innervation. We observed densest innervation in the nasopharynx and oral cavity including taste papillae, some innervation of tracheal and pharyngeal muscles, and sparse innervation of stomach muscle (Extended Data Fig. 10b). Innervation was not observed in many other internal organs, including the heart, oesophagus, aorta and carotid sinus. The nasopharynx is a rich site for immune surveillance, as it connects the nasal cavity to the rest of the respiratory system and provides an early line of mucosal immune defence37. Influenza infection increases PGE2 levels locally within the nasopharynx38, and in humans leads to inflammation of nasopharyngeal tonsils39. Mice have an orthologous system known as nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue40, so we tested whether GABRA1 axons were located near relevant immune mediators. GABRA1 axons were enriched dorsally in epithelial and subepithelial layers of the nasopharynx (Fig. 5b) and notably, cyclooxygenase-2 expression was likewise detected in dorsal epithelium of the nasopharynx (Fig. 5c). Moreover, cyclooxygenase-2 expression was markedly upregulated in dorsal nasopharynx after influenza infection in mice (Fig. 5c). Thus, GABRA1 neurons occupy a strategic and privileged position for detection of the increased PGE2 levels that occur during viral infection.DiscussionDespite seasonal vaccination and antiviral therapeutics, influenza A viral infection remains one of the most severe human threats, affecting millions of people worldwide each year. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are among the most prevalent anti-sickness and anti-pain medications, with around 30 billion doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) consumed annually in the USA alone41. Blockade of PGE2 production alleviates sickness, and several models have been proposed for how the brain receives input about a peripheral infection through PGE2 (ref. 2). Here, we observe that influenza-induced sickness behaviours were similarly attenuated by 1) ibuprofen, aspirin and EP3 receptor antagonism, 2) Ptger3-targeted gene knockout using Advillin-creER, Phox2b-cre and Gabra1-IRES-cre mice, and direct AAV-cre injection in NJP ganglia, 3) ablation of GABRA1 NJP neurons, and 4) and glossopharyngeal nerve transection. From these combined results, we conclude that a small cluster of Gabra1-expressing glossopharyngeal sensory neurons detects PGE2 and induces a neuronally orchestrated state of sickness associated with a suite of behavioural responses to respiratory viral infection.Prostaglandins and many other cytokines can activate vagal and other peripheral afferents in vitro8,29,31, but their physiological roles in naturalistic infections have been difficult to parse. Vagotomy blocks sickness responses to cytokines and lipopolysaccharide in some studies but not others42,43, and this variability may be owing to the location or dose of pyrogen administration. Our findings indicate a clear role for sparse glossopharyngeal sensory neurons that are anatomically poised to detect influenza-induced PGE2. PGE2 has limited stability in vivo44, so peripheral sensory neurons that directly detect PGE2 at the infection site would seemingly provide a fast and robust conduit for information transfer to the brain.Sickness behaviours have been proposed to help conserve energy to fight off infection1. However, eliminating the influenza detection pathway of the glossopharyngeal nerve not only attenuates sickness behaviour, but also promotes survival. Knockout of EP3 from a small group of glossopharyngeal neurons is sufficient to mimic the profound survival phenotype observed in full-body knockouts. One model is that pathogen-induced anorexia is beneficial in some infection models but harmful in others. For example, blocking PGE2 production is harmful during mycobacterium 3 infection45, but promotes survival during influenza infection19,46. Moreover, glucose gavage is detrimental during bacterial sepsis, where blood glucose may provide direct fuel for the pathogen, but protective during influenza infection47. Thus, disrupting neuronal responses to infection may decrease mortality by attenuating changes in feeding behaviour. Moreover, an infection-activated, anorexia-promoting neural pathway may provide a net survival benefit during certain bacterial infections, and thus is maintained over evolution, but is harmful during viral infection, as observed here. In addition, sickness behaviour may provide a separate population-level benefit as sick animals seek isolation and thereby limit pathogen transmission to kin48.These findings indicate that targeted EP3 receptor knockout in sensory neurons not only affects sickness behaviour, but also the immune response and viral transition from the upper to lower respiratory tract. A parsimonious interpretation of these findings is that petrosal GABRA1 neurons, on detection of PGE2, engage neural circuits that evoke coordinated responses that include sickness behaviours as well as motor reflexes that affect immune function. Additionally, changes in feeding behaviour may secondarily affect immune function47,48 and activation of petrosal GABRA1 neurons may affect levels of cytokines other than PGE2 (Extended Data Fig. 9c), which can potentially elicit further neuronal feedback and enhance sickness behaviour. All such responses to infection would critically depend on the EP3 receptor in petrosal GABRA1 neurons, which serves an essential role in first relaying the presence of an upper respiratory infection to the brain, ultimately evoking sickness behaviour.Influenza infection-induced sickness behaviour was attenuated, but not eliminated, following NSAID treatment, targeted EP3 receptor knockout, targeted neuronal ablation and glossopharyngeal nerve transection, suggesting other routes to sickness. Of note, the kinetics of residual sickness behaviour following manipulation of petrosal GABRA1 neurons matches the time course of virus accumulation in the lungs, indicating that there are probably two phases of influenza-induced sickness behaviour. The first phase occurs when the virus is most prevalent in the upper respiratory tract, and sickness is primarily mediated by PGE2-detecting glossopharyngeal sensory neurons marked by GABRA1, which project to the nasopharynx. The second phase of sickness occurs when the virus is most prevalent in the lower respiratory tract, and the lung is primarily innervated by vagal rather than glossopharyngeal sensory neurons. Our data raise the possibility that this second phase of sickness involves another neuronal pathway independent of PGE2, EP3 and glossopharyngeal sensory neurons. Inhibitors of residual neuro–immune interaction pathways, once identified, could potentially provide improved relief of influenza-induced malaise when used in combination with NSAIDs. We also note that PGE2 receptors are expressed in multiple NJP sensory neuron types, as well as in the brain and dorsal root ganglia. It is likely that the nervous system uses multiple sensory pathways to detect peripheral infections, with different sensors perhaps specialized for particular pathogen types or infection locations in the body. In this way, gut and respiratory sensory neurons could potentially engage different neural circuits that lead, for example, to either cough or nausea31,49. Consistent with this notion, various routes to sickness are differentially sensitive to pharmacological inhibition; for example, gut malaise is treated clinically using antagonists of the serotonin receptor HTR3A50. Understanding the diversity of sensory pathways to sickness and when they are engaged by different pathogen infections will provide an essential framework for deciphering this complex and poorly understood physiological state, and may enable improved therapeutic interventions.MethodsAnimalsAll animal procedures followed the ethical guidelines outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all protocols were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) at Harvard Medical School. Mice were maintained under constant temperature (23 ± 1 °C) and relative humidity (46 ± 5%) with a 12-h light:dark cycle. Wild-type C57BL/6J (000664), Nestin-cre (003771), Phox2b-cre (016223), Advillin-creER (032027), Trpv1-IRES-cre (017769), Pdyn-IRES-cre (027958), Piezo2-EGFP-IRES-cre (027719), Oxtr-IRES-cre (031303), Agrp-cre (012899), lsl-DTR (007900), lsl-tdTomato (Ai14, 007914) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Gabra1-IRES-cre, lsl-L10-GFP and Ptger3flox mice were previously generated14,22,51.Influenza A virus inoculationInfluenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) was purchased from Charles River Avian Vaccine Services (10100374) with a EID50 of 1012 ml−1. Virus was diluted in sterile saline for the administered dosage, which was EID50 106 ml−1 unless otherwise indicated. Viral administration was adapted from previous studies52. Awake mice were manually restrained and influenza A virus was delivered through each nostril (25 μl total volume) slowly using a P200 pipette to prevent spillage or delivery to the mouth. After administration, the mice were held with nostrils upright for 10–15 s, and returned to their cage.Behavioural monitoringFor analysis of influenza A virus infection-induced behavioural changes, six- to eight-week-old mice without sex bias were singly housed with free access to food and water. Baseline values were obtained by measuring daily food intake, daily water intake, body weight, and motility for three days before inoculation. After viral infection, all measurements were expressed as a percentage change from baseline values. Food and water intake were calculated daily by measuring the change in weight of remaining food and water in the cage. Animal movement was recorded (C922x Pro Stream Webcam, Logitech) in the home cage for 30 min daily and motility expressed as the total distance moved, as determined by the MTrack2 plug-in available in ImageJ (1.53q, NIH). For measurement of acute food intake, mice were fasted for 24 h, and at dark onset, were administered with PGE2 or sulprostone (EP3 agonist, 14765, Cayman Chemical Company) via the exposure route and doses indicated in Figure legends. Animals were then singly housed in clean cages with ad libitum access to food and water, and the amount of food consumed for 1 h determined by measuring the food in the cage before and after the test period.Body temperature measurementsCore body temperature was monitored by a rectal probe or radio telemetry. Rectal probe measurements were made hourly each day from noon to midnight using a mouse rectal temperature probe (Kent Scientific, RET-3, 0.16 mm tip diameter) connected to a thermometer (Kent Scientific WD-20250-9). Probes were sterilized (70% ethanol), lubricated (Aquagel lubricating gel, ParkerLabs, 57-05), and inserted ~5–7 mm into the rectum of physically restrained mice, and temperature was recorded for 30 s. For radio telemetry, a radio telemetry device that reports body temperature (HD-X11, DSI) was surgically implanted in the abdominal cavity. Surgery was performed under anaesthesia with avertin (200 mg kg−1, intraperitoneal injection) and the abdominal area was disinfected and shaved. A ~1 cm incision was made, and the abdominal peritoneum at the linea alba was gently exposed to insert the sterile radio telemetry device. The surgery site was sealed with VICRYL Sutures (J392H, Ethicon). Animals received Buprenorphine SR (BupSR-LAB, ZooPharm, 20 mg kg−1 subcutaneously at the back of the neck), and were allowed to recover for at least a week. Body temperature data were collected over 15 min intervals with a receiver (easyTEL, Emka Technologies) connected to a computer running iox software v.2.10.8. All data points from one mouse on a given day were averaged.Pharmacological manipulationsIbuprofen (I4883) and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, A5376) were purchased from Sigma, and PGE2 receptor antagonists SC-51322 (2791), PF-04418948 (4818), DG-041 (6240), and ONO-AE3-208 (3565) were purchased from Tocris. Ibuprofen (1 mg ml−1, saline) was added to drinking water ad libitum, and aspirin (20 mg kg−1, saline) and PGE2 receptor antagonists (1 mg kg−1, saline) were injected (intraperitoneally) daily. Administration of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors and PGE2 receptor antagonists began 3 days before virus inoculation and continued to the end of the monitoring period. Tamoxifen was administed daily for 5 days (intraperitoneal injection, 70 mg kg−1) at least one week before influenza virus infection.Ganglion injectionNJP ganglia were injected with AAVs or diphtheria toxin as previously described34, with minor modifications. Mice were anaesthetized (200 mg kg−1 avertin, intraperitoneal injection), and depth of anaesthesia ensured throughout the procedure by lack of a toe pinch response. NJP ganglia were exposed and serially injected (10 × 13.8 nl) with saline solution containing either AAVs (titre > 6.7 × 1012 vg ml−1) or diphtheria toxin (5 μg ml−1, Sigma) supplemented with 0.05% Fast Green FCF Dye (Sigma) using a sharply pulled glass pipette attached to a Nanoject Injector (Drummond). AAV-cre (AAV-Syn-Cre-GFP, SignaGen Laboratories, SL100892, AAV9), AAV-flex-tdTomato (AAV9.CAG.Flex.tdTomato.WPRE.BGH, Addgene, 51503, AAV9), AAV-GFP (pENN.AAV.CB7.CI.eGFP.WPRE.rBG, Addgene, 105542, AAV9), and AAV-flex-AP (AAV9.CAG.flex.PLAP.WPRE.bgH, custom virus, Boston Children’s Hospital Viral Core, Boston, MA, AAV9) were purchased. Successful injection was verified by Fast Green FCF Dye slowly filling the entire ganglion without leakage. Surgical wounds were closed with coated VICRYL Sutures (J392H, Ethicon) and animals received Buprenorphine SR (BupSR-LAB, ZooPharm, 20 mg kg−1 subcutaneously at the back of the neck) as an analgesic. Animals recovered for at least two weeks for behavioural analysis or four weeks for histological analysis.Nerve transectionMice were anaesthetized (200 mg kg−1 avertin, intraperitoneal injection), and depth of anaesthesia ensured throughout the procedure by lack of a toe pinch response. NJP ganglia were surgically exposed, and the glossopharyngeal nerve was identified and severed immediately adjacent to the ganglia using microscissors. Sham surgeries involved NJP ganglia exposure without nerve transection. Surgical wounds were closed with coated VICRYL Sutures (J392H, Ethicon) and animals received 20 mg kg−1 Buprenorphine SR (BupSR-LAB, ZooPharm, subcutaneously at the back of the neck) as an analgesic. Animals recovered for at least two weeks before behavioural analysis.Histological and anatomical analysisImmunohistochemistry and analysis of native tissue fluorescence was performed after intracardial perfusion of fixative (10 ml PBS, then 10 ml 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS). For whole-mount DTR immunostaining, NJP ganglia were collected and permeabilized (11.5 g glycine, 400 ml PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100, 100 ml DMSO) at 37 °C for 1 week. Ganglia were then blocked (1 h, room temperature) in blocking buffer (5% normal donkey serum, 017-000-121, Jackson in 0.05% Tween-20/PBS) and incubated (overnight, 4 °C) with 1:200 anti-DTR (HB-EGF, Goat, AF259NA, Fisher Scientific) in blocking buffer. Samples were washed (4 × 10 min, 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, room temperature) and incubated (2 h, room temperature) with anti-goat Alexa 488 solution (Jackson Immunoresearch, 705-545-147, 1:500 in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20). Tissues were washed again (4 × 10 min, 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, room temperature), mounted (Fluoromount G medium, SouthernBiotech) onto microscope slides (Fisher Scientific), and visualized using a Leica SP5 II confocal microscope and analysed using ImageJ (1.53q). For cyclooxygenase-2 immunostaining, nasopharyngeal tissue was cryosectioned (15 μm), blocked (1 h, room temperature) with blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum, PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100), and incubated (overnight, 4 °C) with anti-COX2 antibody (rabbit, ab179800, Abcam, 1:500 in PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100). Sections were washed (3 × 10 min, room temperature, PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100) and incubated (2 h, room temperature) with anti-rabbit Alexa 488 solution (Jackson Immunoresearch, 711-545-152, 1:1,000 in PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100). Sections were washed again (3 × 10 min, room temperature, PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100), mounted with Fluoromount G medium, and visualized using a Leica SP5 II confocal microscope. To visualize brainstem axons, brainstem cryosections (20 μm) were obtained from AAV-injected mice, and processed as described above for cyclooxygenase-2 immunostaining in nasopharyngeal tissue, except antibodies were 1:1,000 anti-GFP (chicken, GFP-1020, Aves Labs), 1:1,000 anti-RFP (rabbit, 600-401-379, Rockland), anti-chicken Alexa 647 (Jackson Immunoresearch, 703-605-155, 1:300) and anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson Immunoresearch, 111-165-144, 1:300). To visualize axons in nasopharynx, fixed nasopharyngeal (15 μm) sections were stained as above for cyclooxygenase-2 immunostaining, but with anti-RFP primary antibody followed by anti-rabbit Cy3 secondary antibody. For GABRA1 neuron innervation to the trachealis and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscles, tissues were collected fresh, cut along the ventral axis for open-book visualization, fixed (4% paraformaldehyde/PBS either 1 h, room temperature or overnight, 4 °C), and stained for tdTomato as above for tdTomato visualization in nasopharynx, except primary antibody incubation (36 h, 4 °C) and subsequent washes (3 × 12 h, 4 °C) were longer. For visualizing alkaline phosphatase, animals were perfused with PBS, and tissues were collected, fixed (4% paraformaldehyde, 1 h, room temperature), and washed in cold PBS. Tissues were then incubated (70 °C, 2 h) in alkaline phosphatase buffer (0.1 M Tris HCl pH 9.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 5 mM levamisole) and washed twice in alkaline phosphatase buffer. Alkaline phosphatase activity was visualized with NCT/BCIP solution (34042, ThermoFisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s protocols. Stained samples were post-fixed (4% paraformaldehyde, overnight, 4 °C), dehydrated through a series of ethanol washes, and cleared using a 1:2 mixture of benzyl alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich 402834-500ML): benzyl benzoate (Sigma-Aldrich B6630-1L). The tissue was then cut along the ventral axis for open-book visualization. Whole-mount stainings were captured by microscopy with an AxioZoom (Zeiss) and analysed using ImageJ (1.53q).Analysis of mRNA expression in situDNA-based hybridization chain reaction (HCR) probes against Ptger3 (lot no. PRH698) and Phox2b (lot no. PRF341) were purchased from Molecular Instruments. Hybridization solution (30% formamide, 5× SSC, 9 mM citric acid (pH 6), 0.1% Tween-20, 50 μg ml−1 heparin, 1× Denhardt’s solution, 10% dextran sulfate), probe wash buffer (30% formamide, 5× SSC, 9 mM citric acid pH 6.0, 0.1% Tween-20, 50 μg ml−1 heparin), amplification buffer (5× SSC, 0.1% Tween-20, 10% dextran sulfate), and fluorophore-labelled HCR amplifiers were purchased from Molecular Instruments. NJP ganglia were freshly collected, mounted in OCT (Sakura Finetek) and cryosectioned (10 μm). Tissue was post-fixed (4% PFA, PBS, room temperature, 20 min), washed (3 × 10 min, PBS, room temperature), treated with 1% hydrogen peroxide (PBS, room temperature, 20 min), and incubated with Ptger3 and Phox2b HCR probes (0.4 pmol, hybridization buffer in a humidified chamber, 37 °C, overnight). Tissue was then washed (15 min, 37 °C) with (1) 3:1 probe wash buffer: 5× SSCT (5× SSC, 0.1% Tween-20), (2) 1:1 probe wash buffer: 5× SSCT, (3) 1:3 probe wash buffer: 5× SSCT, and (4) 5× SSCT. Tissue was then incubated with amplification buffer (30 min, room temperature), and then with fluorescent HCR amplifiers (6 pmol, Alexa594 for Ptger3 probe and Alexa 488 for Phox2b probe) in amplification buffer (humidified chamber, room temperature, overnight). Tissue was then washed (5× SSCT, 2 × 30 min, 1 × 5 min, room temperature), mounted in Fluoromount G medium, and visualized with by confocal microscopy (Leica SP5 II).Single-cell transcriptomicsAll UMAP plots in this manuscript were made from published single-cell transcriptome data (GEO Accession ID: GSE145216)22 using Seurat (4.1.0) and R Studio (4.1.2).Quantitative PCR analysisLevels of mouse Ptger3, Gapdh transcript and the influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) were measured in cDNA obtained from hypothalamus, NJP ganglia, nasal lavage (for upper respiratory tract analysis), and/or BALF (for lower respiratory tract analysis). BALF was collected by surgically opening the neck and cannulating a 21G catheter into the trachea. In total, 3 × 1 ml of PBS was slowly injected into the lungs then solution was gently aspirated back to the syringe and collected. Collected BALF was centrifuged (7 min, 400g, 4 °C), and the supernatants were stored (−80 °C) until analysis. Nasal lavage was performed by inserting a needle (26G) into the upper trachea angled toward the nose. Sterile PBS (1 ml) was administered through the needle via a cannulated syringe (PE20 polyethylene cannula, inner diameter 0.38 mm), and collected after expulsion from the nose. RNA was collected and cDNA synthesized from BALF, nasal lavage fluid, and homogenized tissue using Trizol (15596026, ThermoFisher) and the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (4368813, ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. qPCR analysis was performed on cDNA using gene-specific primers, PowerTrack SYBR Green Master Mix (A46012, ThermoFisher) on QuantStudio 7 qPCR instrument (ThermoFisher). Gapdh primers were GGGTGTGAACCACGAGAAATATG and TGTGAGGGAGATGCTCAGTGTTG; Ptger3 primers were CAACCTTTTCTTCGCCTCTG and TTTCTGCTTCTCCGTGTGTG; and influenza virus nucleoprotein primers were GACGATGCAACGGCTGGTCTG and ACCATTGTTCCAACTCCTTT. Expression levels of Ptger3 and nucleoprotein were normalized to Gapdh levels. Normalization was by the 2–ΔCT method for Extended Data Fig. 4a, and the 2–ΔΔCT method53 for Extended Data Fig. 9b, with added normalization using values from uninfected controls.PGE2 and cytokine measurementsMice were euthanized at different time points after infection with influenza A virus. Whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture using a 0.5 M EDTA-coated needle and syringe and mixed immediately with 0.5 M EDTA (50 μl). Plasma was isolated by centrifugation (3,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant stored (−80 °C) until ELISA analysis. BALF was collected as described above. PGE2 and cytokine levels were measured in plasma and/or BALF by ELISA (R&D Systems, PGE2: KGE004B, TNF: DY410-5, IFNγ: DY485-05, IL-6: DY406-05) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Calcium imagingNJP ganglia were acutely collected from Gabra1-IRES-cre; lsl-tdTomato mice and incubated (37 °C, 90 min, with rotation) in dissociation solution (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) containing liberase (55 mg ml−1, Roche, 05401135001), DNase (0.004%, Worthington, LS002007)). Cells were than pelleted (3 min, 300g, 4 °C) and resuspended in 0.2% ovomucoid, 0.004% DNase, DMEM, 200 μl. Using a P200 pipette, cells were triturated at least 10 times until clumps were not visible, filtered through a 40 μm mesh cell strainer, and pelleted again (3 min, 300g, 4 °C). Cells were then resuspended in culture medium containing 5 μM Calbryte 520 AM (20651, AAT Bioquest); culture medium contains 1× B27 (Gibco, 17504044), 1× N2 (Gibco, 17502048), 1× penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco, 15140122) in Neurobasal media without phenol red (Gibco, 12348017). Resuspended cells were then plated onto laminin-coated cover glass and incubated (37 °C, at least 30 min before imaging) in a humidified CO2 incubator. The cover glass was then transferred to a chamber with an inlet and outlet perfusion (Warner Instruments, RC-24N) with continuous flow of Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS). The calcium responses were then imaged (488 nm) on perfusion of prostaglandin E2 (1 μM in HBSS, 2 min) and KCl (150 mM, at the end of the run). GABRA1-positive neurons were identified by tdTomato fluorescence (568 nm). Cells were identified as responsive if mean Calbryte 520 AM fluorescence during the stimulation period exceeded three standard deviations above the baseline mean.Fibre photometryFibre photometry of AGRP neurons was performed as described54 with PGE2 (intraperitoneal injection, 0.5 mg kg−1) or PBS acutely injected during a brief manual restraint using Synapses software (Build: 94-42329P, Tucker-Davis Technology). Data were analysed using Matlab (R2020a).Statistical analysisData in graphs are represented as mean ± s.e.m., with all sample sizes and P values provided in figure legends. Statistical analysis for behavioural experiments involved averaging daily changes in parameters indicated per mouse (days 1–10 after infection or through survival). Statistical significance was calculated with Prism 8.4.3 software (GraphPad), and involved statistical tests described in figure legends. Probit analysis in Extended Data Fig. 5b was performed with SPSS, 21 (IBM). Sample sizes were chosen based on prior expertise and publications in our field26,55 and are disclosed in the Figure legends. Animal groups were randomly assigned and control animals were age-matched to experimental animals. The same investigator performed genotyping and analysis of sickness responses, so data were not generated blind to genotype or experimental group.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Wild bears, skunks and sea lions are just some of the mammals infected with H5N1 A deadly version of avian influenza is behind an outbreak in wild birds, including pelicans in Lima, Peru (shown) and domestic poultry. The virus has also been detected in mammals, although there is no evidence of widespread transmission in animals other than birds. ERNESTO BENAVIDES/AFP via Getty Images Share this:EmailFacebookTwitterPinterestPocketRedditPrint By Erin Garcia de Jesús March 6, 2023 at 9:00 am An uncomfortable truth is that there is another influenza pandemic in humankind’s future. Whether it will be a relative of the lethal avian flu strain currently wreaking havoc in bird populations around the globe is anyone’s guess. Because the virus, called H5N1, can be deadly to birds, mammals and people, researchers closely monitor reports of new cases. Worryingly, a new variant of H5N1 that emerged in 2020 has not only spread farther than ever before among birds, but has also spilled over into other animals, raising the specter of a human outbreak (SN: 12/12/22). The variant was linked to a seal die-off in Maine last summer. In October, there was an H5N1 outbreak on a mink farm in Spain, researchers reported in January in Eurosurveillance. (It’s unclear how the mink were exposed, but the animals were fed poultry by-products.) Sea lions off the coast of Peru and wild bears, foxes and skunks, which prey upon or scavenge birds, in the United States and Europe have also tested positive for the virus. Globally, hundreds of millions of domestic poultry have been culled or died from the new variant. It’s also likely that millions of wild birds have died, though few governmental agencies are counting, says Michelle Wille a viral ecologist at the University of Sydney who studies avian influenza. “This virus is catastrophic for bird populations.” A handful of human cases have also been reported, though there’s no evidence that the virus is spreading among people. Of seven cases, six people recovered and one person from China died. In February, health officials in China reported an eighth case in a woman whose current condition is unknown. What’s more, four of the reported human cases — including a U.S. case from Colorado and two workers linked to the Spanish mink farm — were in people who didn’t have any respiratory symptoms. That leaves open the possibility that those people were not truly infected. Instead, tests may have picked up viral contamination, say in the nose, that the people breathed in while handling infected birds. The impossibility of predicting which avian influenza viruses might make the jump to people and spark an outbreak is in part related to knowledge gaps. These bird pathogens don’t typically easily infect or circulate among mammals including humans. And scientists don’t have a full grasp on how these viruses might need to change for human transmission to occur. For now, it’s encouraging that so few people have gotten infected amid such a large outbreak among birds and other animals, says Marie Culhane, a food animal veterinarian at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul. Still, experts around the globe are diligently watching for any signs the virus may be evolving to spread more easily between people. The good news is that flu drugs and vaccines that work against the virus already exist, Wille says. Compared with where the world was when the coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic came on the scene, “we are already ahead of the game.” How the virus would need to change to spread among people is a big unknown This new iteration of bird flu is what’s called a highly pathogenic avian influenza, one that is particularly lethal for both domestic and wild birds. Aquatic birds such as ducks naturally carry avian flus with no or minor signs of infection. But when influenza viruses shuffle between poultry and waterfowl, variants with changes that make them lethal to birds can emerge and spread. Avian viruses can be severe or even deadly for people. Since 2003, there have been 873 human cases of H5N1 infections reported to the World Health Organization. A little less than half of those people died. In February, an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia died after she developed severe pneumonia from an avian flu virus, the country’s first reported infection since 2014. Her father was also infected with the virus — a different variant than the one behind the widespread outbreak in birds —though he has not developed symptoms. It’s unknown how the two people were exposed. Some of what scientists know about H5N1’s pandemic potential comes from controversial research on ferrets done more than a decade ago (SN: 6/21/13). Experiments showed that some changes to proteins that help the virus break into cells and make more copies of itself could help the virus travel through the air to infect ferrets, a common laboratory stand-in for humans in influenza research. While researchers know these mutations are important in lab settings, it’s still unclear how crucial those changes are in the real world, says Jonathan Runstadler, a disease ecologist and virologist at Tufts University’s Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine in North Grafton, Mass. Infected mammals A variety of mammal species have tested positive for avian influenza across the United States. Each symbol represents the counties that have reported cases. States colors indicate the routes birds take, called flyways, as they migrate south for the winter or north for the summer. Detections of the new H5N1 bird flu variant in U.S. mammals, 2022–2023 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service/USDAAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service/USDA Viruses change constantly, but not all genetic tweaks work together. A change may help one version of the virus transmit better, while also hurting another variant and making it less likely to spread. “We’re not sure how critical or how big a difference or how much to worry about those mutations when they happen in the wild,” Runstadler says. “Or when they happen five years down the road when there are other changes in the virus’s genetic background that are impacting those [original] mutations.” That doesn’t stop researchers from trying to pinpoint specific changes. Runstadler and his team look for viruses in nature that have jumped into new animals and work backward to figure out which mutations were crucial. And virologist Louise Moncla says her lab is trying to develop ways to scan entire genetic blueprints of viruses from past outbreaks to look for signatures of a virus that can jump between different animal species. “There’s a ton that we don’t know about avian influenza viruses and host switching,” says Moncla, of the University of Pennsylvania. Genetic analyses of H5N1 circulating on the mink farm in Spain, for instance, revealed a change known to help the virus infect mice and mammalian cells grown in the lab. Such a change could make it easier for the virus to spread among mammals, including people. There could have been mink-to-mink transmission on the farm, the researchers concluded, but it remains unclear how much of a role that specific mutation played in the outbreak. It’s a numbers game for when influenza viruses with the ability to transmit among mammals might make the jump from birds, Runstadler says. “The more chances you give the virus to spill over and adapt, the higher the risk will be that one of those adaptations will be effective [at helping the virus spread among other animals] or take root and be a real problem.” The ongoing outbreak is still a big problem for birds Irrespective of our inability to forecast human’s future with H5N1, it’s clear that many species of birds — and some other animals that eat them — are dying now. And more species of birds are dying in this outbreak than previous ones, Culhane and Wille say. “We have seen huge outbreaks in raptors and seabirds, which were never really affected before,” Wille says. It’s possible that genetic changes have helped the virus to spread more efficiently among birds than previous versions of H5N1, but that’s unknown. “There are a number of studies underway to try and figure it out,” Wille says. Researchers and farmers around the world monitor cases of bird flu on commercial and backyard farms to keep track of deadly avian flus that could jeopardize flocks.

Sporadic outbreaks of H5N1 variants are typically limited to places such as parts of Asia, where the virus has circulated in birds since its emergence in the late 1990s, and northern Africa. North America’s last big avian flu outbreak was in 2015, when experts detected more than 200 cases of a different bird flu virus in commercial and backyard poultry across the United States. The poultry industry culled more than 45 million birds to stop that virus’s spread, Culhane says. “But it didn’t go away from the rest of the world.” The latest version of H5N1 arrived on North American shores from Europe in late 2021, first popping up in Canada in Newfoundland and Labrador. From there, it spread south into the United States, where so far tens of millions of domestic poultry have been culled to prevent transmission on farms where the virus has been detected. By December 2022, the virus had made it to South America. In Peru, tens of thousands of pelicans and more than 700 sea lions have died since mid-January. It’s important to understand exactly how nonbird animals are getting exposed, Culhane says. Highly pathogenic avian influenzas infect every organ of a bird’s body. So, a fox chowing down on an infected bird is exposing its own mouth, nose and stomach to a lot of virus as it eats its meal. For now, experts are keeping an eye on infected animals to raise the alarm early if H5N1 starts transmitting among mammals. “I do think that the mink outbreak, and then the sea lion outbreak, is a wake-up call,” Moncla says. “We should be doing our very best to implement all the science we can to try and understand what’s happening with these viruses so that if the situation does change, we are better prepared.” Questions or comments on this article?

Study: Emergence of Novel Reassortant H1N2 Swine Influenza Virus.

Background Swine is essentially involved in the influenza virus evolution, with prevalent swine influenza virus subtypes including H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. H1N1 swine influenza viruses include the classical swine (CS)-type H1N1, Eurasian avian (EA)-type H1N1, and 2009 pandemic H1N1, which is often referred to as 2009/H1N1. During the human pandemic influenza virus outbreak in 1918, the CS H1N1 strain was found to infect and evolve among pigs for over 70 years until 1979, which is when the EA H1N1 strain emerged and gradually replaced the CS H1N1 strain in Asia and Europe. The 2009/H1N1 strain was isolated from Canadian pigs in May of 2009, after which the strain spread swiftly across the globe. During its circulation, the 2009/H1N1 strain underwent continual reassortant with local strains of swine influenza viruses, which expanded the genomic diversity of swine influenza viruses. Cells of the swine upper respiratory epithelium secrete α-2,3-linked sialic acid avian-like receptors and α-2,6-linked sialic acid human-like receptors. As a result, influenza viruses that are avian and mammalian in their origin can successfully infect swine, thus allowing these animals to act as ‘mixing vessels’ for different influenza viruses. About the review Phylogenetic analysis was performed to assess genetic associations of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene and swine-isolated H1 influenza virus genotypes using the constructed maximum likelihood tree of swine and human pandemic H1 segments. Bayesian time-measured phylogenetic tree of SIV HA genes and H1N2 swine influenza virus genotypes were assessed. Influenza A virus (IAV) was sequenced and strains of swine influenza viruses were assessed using reference sequences of the influenza research database (IRD) and the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) database. Branch lengths representing antigenic distances, as well as phylogenetic host-swine, host-human, and isolation date rings, were assessed. To further explore the genomic constitution of the H1N2 swine influenza viruses, all swine sequences were downloaded and divided into 12 genotypes ranging from G1 to G12. Molecular marker analysis was performed and the origination of HA genes was determined. Results The maximum likelihood tree of human and swine pandemic H1 segments comprised 361 and 2,427 viruses of swine and human origin, respectively. Three H1N2 swine influenza virus strains including the A/swine/Liaoning/3330/2020, A/swine/Liaoning/3327/2020, and A/swine/Liaoning/3328/2020 were identified. The three viral isolates were new triple reassortants belonging to the G12 genotype. The polymerase, matrix (M), and nucleoprotein (NP) genes, as well as the swine 2009/H1N1 strains, were grouped, whereas the neuraminidase (NA) genes and human H3N2 strains were grouped, and the non-structural (NS) genes and TR H1N2 strains were grouped. The three H1N2 swine influenza viruses detected in the Liaoning province gained their HA genes from the human 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses circulating in 2019 that were transmitted to pigs from humans. Molecular markers in the HA gene that enhance virulence and receptor-binding ability, as well as cause antigenic drifts, included HA-158E, HA-190D, and HA-200A, each of which was identified in the 2019/H1N2 swine influenza viruses. The I117V genetic mutation in the NA gene led to a mild decrease in sensitivity to oseltamivir. In addition, molecular markers contributing to mammal host adaptabilities, including PA 195R, M1 215A, and NS1 42S, were detected in the human 2009 pandemic H1N2 strains. All three 2009/H1N2 swine influenza viruses comprised the PSIQSR/GLF motif at the HA cleavage region, which is characteristic of avian-influenza viruses of low pathogenicity. Conclusions Overall, the study findings showed that the swine ‘mixing vessel’ characteristic led to the switching of genetic components between human seasonal strains and swine influenza epidemic strains during swine coinfections. This generated new reassortants with enhanced adaptability to humans and pandemic potentials, as demonstrated during the emergence of 2009/H1N1. Thus, further research must be conducted to assess swine influenza virus surveillance. *Important notice: Preprints with The Lancet publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

FeatureEdited by Amit ChaturvediUpdated: March 10, 2023 1:09 pm ISTThe H3N2 virus causes respiratory illness.The central government sources have said that H3N2, the sub-type of the Influenza A virus, has claimed two lives in the country. While one person died in Haryana, the other fatality was reported from Karnataka. The government sources also said that 90 cases of the flu caused by this virus have been reported across the country. H3N2 has in the past causes a number of influenza outbreaks in the country. The prevalence of flu symptoms among people is also influenced by the change in weather from extremely cold to warm.What is H3N2 virus?It is an influenza virus that causes respiratory infection. The virus can also infect birds and mammals. In bird and other animals, it has mutated into many strains.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comH3N2 is a subtype of Influenza A virus, which is an important cause of human influenza, according to Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and World health Organization (WHO).What are the symptoms?According to WHO, avian, swine and other zoonotic influenza infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and even death. Some of the common symptoms of H3N2 virus are:ChillsCoughingFeverNauseaVomitingThroat ache/sore throatAn ache in muscles and bodyIn some cases, diarrhoea Sneezing and runny noseIf a person experiences difficulty in breathing, pain or discomfort in chest, continuous fever and pain in throat while gulping down the food, it is very important to see a doctor.How does the virus spread?The extremely contagious H3N2 influenza can be transmitted from one person to another through droplets released when coughing, sneezing, or talking by an infected individual. It can also spread if someone touches their mouth or nose after contacting a surface that has the virus on it. Pregnant women, young children, elderly adults, and persons with underlying medical issues are at a higher risk of flu-related complications.What are the precautions to be taken?Since the virus attacks the respiratory tract, it is very important to:Keep checking the oxygen level continuously with the help of Pulse OximeterIf the oxygen saturation level is less than 95 per cent, a visit to the doctor is mandatory.If the oxygen saturation level is less than 90 per cent, then intensive care may be required.Experts caution against self-medication in such casesWhat are the treatment options?Taking proper rest, drinking lots of fluids and using over-the-counter painkillers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower fever are all part of the H3N2 influenza treatment regimen. If a patient has severe symptoms or is at a high risk of problems, a doctor may also recommend antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir and zanamivir.WHO further says that in suspected and confirmed cases, neuraminidase inhibitors should be prescribed as soon as possible (ideally, within 48 hours following symptom onset) to maximize therapeutic benefits.Dos and Don'tsThe virus can spread rapidly among humans from infected people. So, experts say it is very important to follow some protocols:Regularly wash your hands with water and soapWear face masks and avoid crowded areasAvoid touching your nose and mouthCover your nose and mouth properly while coughing and sneezingStay hydrated and consume plenty of fluidsIn case of fever and bodyache, take paracetamolThey also say it's better to avoid:Spitting in public areasUsing contact-based greetings such as shaking hands Self-medicating and taking antibiotics or any other medications without consulting a doctorEating while seated next to other peopleThe Indian Medical Association (IMA) has, meanwhile, urged doctors to not prescribe antibiotics to patients before confirming whether the infection is bacterial, as this can build up a resistance. Most current cases of fever, cough, sore throat, and body ache are cases of influenza, for which antibiotics are not needed.Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world.

An article written by The Royal Melbourne Hospital Professor Ian Barr, Deputy Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute. Speculating on the intensity of influenza seasons in advance is always challenging as the influenza seasons vary considerably from one season to another. There is a saying by those people who work in the field that “If you have seen one influenza season, then you have just seen one influenza season” – meaning that one cannot draw too much confidence by simply observing what happened in the previous season. This is even true when looking to the Northern Hemisphere’s most recent season which is now coming to an end as March begins. Coinciding with the end of their season the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently made a recommendation for the components for the next Northern Hemisphere 2023-2024 influenza vaccine. The reason why these recommendations need to be made some 8 to 10 months before the influenza season is because of the lead time to make and roll-out vaccines in time. One item of interest in this 2023-2024 decision, was the change to the A(H1N1)pdm09 component of the vaccine to a reference virus called A/Victoria/4897/2022. This means that all of the influenza vaccines produced for the 2023-2024 season will contain a derivative of this virus or a similar “like” virus. This virus was originally obtained from a clinical sample provided by the Royal Melbourne Hospital pathology laboratory and isolated at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute. So, back to what our influenza season might present to us in Australia in 2023. One thing for certain is that there will be an influenza season, unlike 2020 and 2021 when COVID-19 and its many restrictions severely affected influenza circulation. In 2022, influenza returned with a vengeance and will again circulate widely in 2023. When the season will start is uncertain. Prior to the pandemic, cases usually increased through May, peaked in August, then waned in October. But this timing may be altered due to COVID-19. In addition, given the difficulty in predicting the severity of the season, it’s again recommended that certain people get vaccinated each year especially the elderly, children under 5 years old, pregnant women, indigenous people and those with underlying health conditions. So, if you want to protect yourself against influenza this year, even if you are not in one of these groups, consider getting an influenza vaccination in 2023.

For developing a candidate vaccine virus against IDV, we sought to produce a temperature-sensitive strain, similar to the live attenuated, cold-adapted vaccine strain available against the influenza A virus (IAV). To this end, we produced a recombinant IDV (designated rD/OK-AL) strain by introducing mutations responsible for the adaptation of the IAV vaccine strain to cold conditions and conferring sensitivity to high temperatures into PB2 and PB1 proteins using reverse genetics. The rD/OK-AL strain grew efficiently at 33 °C but did not grow at 37 °C in the cell culture, indicating its high-temperature sensitivity. In mice, rD/OK-AL was attenuated following intranasal inoculation. It mediated the production of high levels of antibodies against IDV in the serum. When the rD/OK-AL-inoculated mice were challenged with the wild-type virus, the virus was not detected in respiratory organs after the challenge, indicating complete protection against IDV. These results imply that the rD/OK-AL might be a potential candidate for the development of live attenuated vaccines for IDV that can be used to control BRDC.

Further epidemiological studies demonstrated cattle as the primary host2,3, and IDVs circulated in cattle in the American2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, European10,11,12,13,14, Asian15,16,17, and African countries18,19. Although IDV infection causes mild to moderate respiratory illnesses in cattle, two metagenomic studies conducted on cattle diagnosed with bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) have found a positive correlation between IDV infection and BRDC5,20. BRDC is the most common and costly disease affecting the cattle industry21,22,23. In addition, antibodies against IDV have been found in pigs24, sheep25,26, goats25,26, horses27, dromedary camels18,28, deer29, and humans30,31. These findings indicate that IDVs are distributed globally with multiple animal hosts.Since IDV might be one of the causative pathogens of BRDC, the development of vaccines for IDV infection is expected to reduce the incidence of BRDC. A research group in the U.S. produced a prototype inactivated vaccine, in which IDV was treated with β-propiolactone and examined its efficacy in cattle. However, this vaccine was not highly effective in protecting against IDV infection32. Another group designed a DNA vaccine expressing consensus hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) protein of IDV with sequence manipulation. The protective effect of the vaccine was examined against challenges with two lineages of IDVs in a guinea pig model; high vaccine efficacy was observed33.To efficiently induce protective immune effects against respiratory virus, an intranasal spray type live-attenuated vaccine, which can mediate the mucosal immunity to prevent virus infection itself, might be the most desirable dosage form compared to the inactivated vaccine that primarily induces IgG antibody production in the blood. At present, the multivalent modified-live viral vaccine containing attenuated bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus is commercially available and widely used to control BRDC23. Therefore, the attenuated live vaccine could be promising for IDV infection. However, no report has been published examining the attenuated strain of IDV, and genetic mutations that could attenuate the IDV have not been elucidated. The attenuated strains of influenza A virus (IAV) used for the development of live vaccines are the temperature-sensitive, cold-adapted viruses that have been selected by successive passages of the wild-type virus in a low-temperature environment in embryonated chicken eggs or in cell culture34,35. These vaccine strains are attenuated due to reduced growth ability at 37 °C, which is the core body temperature in humans. The previous studies indicated that the adaptation of the IAV live vaccine donor strain, A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (H2N2; A/Le17), to cold temperatures was facilitated by mutations in PB2 and PB1 subunits of viral RNA polymerase36. Equivalent attenuating effects have been observed when these PB2 and PB1 mutations are introduced into other IAV36,37.In this study, we developed a recombinant IDV strain whose PB2 and PB1 genes were manipulated by introducing mutations responsible for facilitating adaptation of the A/Le17 to cold temperatures using our previously reported reverse genetics system38 and examined its temperature sensitivity. Moreover, we evaluated the attenuation phenotype and vaccine efficacy of this recombinant virus by immunization and challenge experiments in a mouse model.ResultsAlignment of PB2 and PB1 proteins between IAV and IDVThe IAV live vaccine donor strain A/Le17 was generated after 20 sequential passages of the wild-type A/Leningrad/134/57 (A/Le) in chicken embryonated eggs performed at 32 °C and additional 17 passages performed at 25 °C35,36. The previous analysis indicated that the high temperature-sensitive, cold-adaptation phenotype in the A/Le17 was primarily facilitated by amino acid mutations V478L in the PB2 and K265N and V591I in the PB136. The RNA polymerase complex of IDV also comprises PB2 and PB1 proteins and possesses structural and functional similarities to IAV39. To search for equivalent positions of temperature-sensitive mutations of IAV in IDV, we aligned amino acid sequences of PB2 and PB1 proteins between IAV and IDV (Fig. 1). We postulated that position 478 of A/Le17 PB2 can correspond to position 494 of IDV PB2. Both D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK; OK clade) and D/bovine/Nebraska/9-5/2012 (D/NE; 660 clade), belonging to two major clades, possess valine, same as the parent A/Le of A/Le17 (Fig. 1A). Although IDV strains of Y2019 clade possess valine as well, those of Y2016 clade possess isoleucine at this position (data not shown). Similarly, we postulated that positions 265 and 591 of A/Le17 PB1 can correspond to positions 267 and 592 of IDV PB1, respectively; both IDV strains and other clade strains possess arginine at position 267, whereas A/Le possesses lysine at position 265 (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, IDV strains possess isoleucine at position 592, as does A/Le17 at position 591. Taken together, we proposed that PB2 V494L and PB1 R267N mutations may facilitate the sensitivity of IDV to temperatures.Figure 1Alignments of PB2 and PB1 protein sequences of influenza A and D viruses. Amino acid sequences of (A) PB2 and (B) PB1 proteins of the wild type A/Leningrad/134/57 (A/Le), vaccine strain A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (A/Le17; adapted to cold temperatures), D/bovine/Nebraska/9–5/2012 (D/NE), and D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK) were aligned. Numbers represent amino acid positions. Hydrophobic, neutral, acidic, and basic amino acids are represented by orange, green, blue, and peach letters, respectively. Consensus amino acids between wild-type IAV and IDV are enclosed in black squares. The amino acid positions responsible for the sensitivity of A/Le17 to high emperatures are indicated by red arrows.Full size imageConstruction of IDV with equivalent mutations responsible for the temperature sensitivity of A/Le17As a strategy for selecting a temperature-sensitive IDV mutant, we sought to generate a recombinant IDV with PB2 V494L and PB1 R267N. We constructed vRNA synthesis plasmids for PB2 and PB1 segments with respective mutations and then generated the recombinant virus via reverse genetics. Because these mutations are expected to attribute temperature sensitivity to the recombinant virus, we performed reverse genetics protocols with cell cultures at 33 °C or 37 °C. The recombinant virus was developed when all procedures with cell cultures were performed only at 33 °C. We designated this rescued recombinant virus as rD/OK-AL. In contrast, no virus was rescued under experimental conditions at 37 °C. The virus rescued at 33 °C did not grow at 37 °C (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the recombinant virus might be sensitive to high temperatures.Figure 2Growth properties of rD/OK-AL at different temperatures. (A) The rescue and passage experiments and the plaque assay were performed at 33 °C and 37 °C, respectively. The plaque formation of rescued rD/OK-AL and rD/OK in ST cells is shown at 37 °C for two days or at 33 °C for three days post-infection. Plaques were immunostained with anti-D/OK mouse polyclonal antibody. (B) The growth kinetics of rD/OK-AL are shown in ST cells at 33 °C or 37 °C. The wild-type D/OK, rD/OK, and rD/OK-AL were inoculated into cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.0001 and incubated at 33 °C or 37 °C. Viral titers were determined at 24-h intervals following infection by plaque assay at 33 °C and reported as mean titers with standard deviations (n = 3). This assay’s limit of detection for infectious virus is 10 PFU/mL. The asterisk indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05 using two-tailed Student’s t-test) between rD/OK and rD/OK-AL at each time-point. (C) The growth kinetics of rD/OK-PB2AL and rD/OK-PB1AL are shown in ST cells at 37 °C. The rD/OK, rD/OK-AL, rD/OK-PB2AL, and rD/OK-PB1AL were inoculated into cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.0001 and incubated at 37 °C. Viral titers were determined at 48-h intervals following infection by the plaque assay at 33 °C and reported as mean titers with standard deviations (n = 3). This assay's limit of detection for infectious viruses is 10 PFU/mL. The asterisk indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05 using the two-tailed Student’s t-test) between rD/OK and rD/OK-PB1AL at each time-point.Full size imageTemperature sensitivity of recombinant rD/OK-ALTo confirm the temperature sensitivity of the rD/OK-AL, we analyzed its growth kinetics in swine testis ST cells at different temperatures. The rD/OK-AL grew only at 33 °C but not at 37 °C (Fig. 2B), confirming its sensitivity to high temperatures. At a temperature of 33 °C, although rD/OK-AL showed lower and slower growth compared to the wild-type D/OK, the corresponding growth was considerably high with a peak titer of more than 107 PFU/mL. These data suggest that rD/OK-AL acquired sensitivity to high temperatures and retained high growth properties at a lower temperature. To evaluate the role that either PB2 V494L or PB1 R267N plays in high-temperature sensitivity, we rescued viruses with each single mutation (namely rD/OK-PB2AL or rD/OK-PB1AL, respectively) at 33 °C and examined their growth properties at 37 °C. The rD/OK-PB1AL did not grow at 37 °C. In contrast, the rD/OK-PB1AL grew at a significantly lower rate than rD/OK (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that PB2 V494L played a vital role and PB2 V494L had a supportive role in the acquisition of high-temperature sensitivity.Pathogenicity of rD/OK-AL in miceTo investigate if the temperature-sensitivity of rD/OK-AL in cell cultures may mediate a change in pathogenicity, we inoculated mice intranasally with 105 PFU of rD/OK-AL or wild-type rD/OK for comparison (Fig. 3A). The rD/OK-AL strain was detected only in nasal turbinates after three days following inoculation and not in the trachea and lungs, whereas rD/OK was detected at high titers in all respiratory organs both after three and six days following inoculation (Fig. 3B). These findings can be possibly attributed to the temperature-sensitivity of the rD/OK-AL because body temperatures are lower in the nasal turbinates than those in the trachea and lungs. In addition, the rD/OK-AL-inoculated mice showed no loss in body weight and kinetics similar to those of the PBS-inoculated control mice during the observation period. In contrast, mice inoculated with the wild-type virus mice showed a trend of weight loss after five days following inoculation (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these results indicate that rD/OK-AL might be highly attenuated in mice.Figure 3Pathogenicity of rD/OK-AL in mice. (A) Schematic presentation of the experimental flow. Respiratory organs containing nasal turbinates, the trachea, and the lungs of mice that were intranasally inoculated with 105 PFU of rD/OK or rD/OK-AL were collected on days three and six following inoculation for viral titration by plaque assay. (B) Titers were measured in the organs of rD/OK or rD/OK-AL-infected mice and reported as the mean titers with standard deviations (n = 4, respectively). The limit of detection for infectious virus by this plaque assay is 102 PFU/g. The asterisk indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05 by two-tailed Student’s t-test) between rD/OK and rD/OK-AL. (C) The kinetics of the body weight of virus-infected or PBS-inoculated mice (n = 5; control) were recorded for 14 days, as reported by changes in percentages based on the values calculated before virus inoculation, which were represented as 100%. The asterisk indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05; two-way ANOVA) between rD/OK and rD/OK-AL.Full size imageImmunogenicity of rD/OK-AL in miceTo investigate the vaccine potential of rD/OK-AL, we examined its immunogenicity in mice. Mice in each group (n = 3) were intranasally inoculated with either rD/OK-AL (105 PFU) or subcutaneously injected with formalin-inactivated D/OK (3.0 µg) for comparison. Sera were collected on day 14 from mice after administration to detect hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibodies against IDV (Fig. 4A). The production of HI antibodies was induced in mice inoculated with rD/OK-AL in higher titers (1:80–1:160) compared to that in mice injected with inactivated D/OK (1:40–1:80) (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that rD/OK-AL might elicit a robust immunogenic response in mice when inoculated intranasally.Figure 4Immunogenicity and protective effect of rD/OK-AL in mice. (A) Schematic presentation of the experimental flow. Mice were intranasally (IN) inoculated with rD/OK-AL (105 PFU) or PBS (as a control), or subcutaneously (SC) injected with inactivated D/OK (3.0 µg). Blood was collected from immunized mice for antibody titration by HI test on day 14. The immunized mice were intranasally challenged with wild-type D/OK (105 PFU) on day 21 and then respiratory organs containing nasal turbinates, the trachea, and the lungs of these mice were collected on days three and six following inoculation for determining viral titrates by plaque assay. The clinical signs of the challenged mice were examined over the period of 14 days following the challenge. (B) HI antibody titers in serum were determined on day 14 following immunization with rD/OK-AL, inactivated D/OK, or PBS and reported as the mean titers with standard deviations (n = 4, respectively). The asterisk indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05 by Kruskal–Wallis test) between rD/OK, rD/OK-AL, and PBS. (C) Virus titers were measured in the organs of challenged mice after three days following the challenge and reported as mean titers with standard deviations (n = 4 for each immunized group). The limit of detection for infectious virus by the assay is 102 PFU/g. The asterisk indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05 by Kruskal–Wallis test) between rD/OK, rD/OK-AL, and PBS.Full size imageProtective effect of rD/OK-AL against IDV in miceTo examine the protective effects of rD/OK-AL against IDV infection, we challenged mice inoculated with rD/OK-AL or those injected with inactivated D/OK intranasally with wild-type D/OK (105 PFU) after 21 days following administration and examined viral titers in respiratory organs three days after the challenge. No virus was detected in all respiratory organs of rD/OK-AL-inoculated mice whereas high titers of viruses were detected in nasal turbinates and the trachea of mice injected with inactivated D/OK; however, no virus was detected in the lungs unlike control mice injected with PBS that showed high titers of viruses in all organs (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrated that rD/OK-AL-inoculated mice acquired more potent protective immunity against the wild-type virus compared to mice injected with inactivated D/OK, suggesting that rD/OK-AL may possess high vaccine developmental potential for protecting against IDV infection.DiscussionReverse genetics, which allows the artificial development of various mutants, is a powerful tool for the development of recombinant vaccine viruses. The well-designed gene-manipulated recombinant viruses are expected to be used as seed viruses for inactivated vaccines or in attenuated live vaccines either in an emergency or in the future. For instance, any HA/NA reassortants with internal RNA segments of master seed viruses that are adapted to cold temperatures could be robustly generated for the development of human seasonal IAV vaccines36,40,41. In addition, candidate vaccines against H5, H7, or H9 avian IAVs have been generated by reverse genetics as a preparation for future pandemics42,43,44,45. In this study, we applied this technology to develop a candidate vaccine for IDV for reducing the incidence of BRDC which is the most common and costly disease affecting the cattle industry globally. Here, we successfully generated a high temperature-sensitive IDV (rD/OK-AL) strain by introducing equivalent mutations into PB2 and PB1 proteins, which are responsible for temperature-sensitivity and adaptation of IAV live vaccine strain (A/Le17) to cold temperatures38. The rD/OK-AL strain demonstrated attenuated phenotype, high immunogenicity, and complete protective effect against IDV infection in a mouse model. These findings indicated a high potential of the rD/OK-AL as a live attenuated IDV vaccine virus in cattle and other livestock.Theoretically, intranasal spray type live vaccines are more effective against respiratory viral diseases than vaccines administered via other routes, such as intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of inactivated vaccines. Live vaccines administered intranasally could elicit a mucosal immune response that directly block viral infection in respiratory tissues and cells as well as enhance cellular immunity. For live vaccines, high temperature-sensitive viruses are ideally used because they are attenuated due to the lack of growth in lower respiratory organs, such as the lungs. So far, no report has been published examining high temperature-sensitive strains of IDV. In contrast, a couple of temperature-sensitive, cold-adapted strains of IAV have been developed as live vaccines. In IAV live vaccine developed using the A/Le17 strain, PB2 V478L and PB1 K265N and V591I are mutations responsible for its temperature-sensitivity35,36. Although precise mechanisms have not been elucidated, the amino acid changes at position 478 in the cap-binding region of PB2 and at positions 265 and 591 in the RNA-binding region of PB135,46 may presumably alter the structural and functional interactions between PB2 or PB1 and viral or host factors at higher temperatures. Notably, these mutations could mediate a similar phenotypic effect in the other IAV36,37. Due to functional similarities, the putative structure of functional domains of PB2 and PB1 proteins should be conserved between IAV and IDV, despite their partial identities in amino acid sequences as shown in Fig. 1. Based on this concept, we aimed to develop mutant rD/OK-AL strain by inducing PB2 V494L and PB1 R267N mutations via reverse genetics as a candidate live vaccine for IDV infection. Consequently, this strategy successfully generated a high temperature-sensitive rD/OK-AL. Additional analyses of virus growth with one single mutation suggest that PB2 V494L is mainly and PB1 R267N is synergically required for the D/OK to acquire the ts phenotype. Understanding the molecular basis of this observation can contribute towards further design of IDV live vaccines.During the spread of IAV infection from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respiratory organs, such as the lungs, the damaged tissues induce high levels of cytokines, resulting in systemic symptoms and sometimes severe illness. Therefore, the strains, which cannot replicate in the lungs, can be attenuated for the development of live vaccines34. Studies on nasal inoculation of mice with high temperature-sensitive viruses have reported significantly reduced or complete loss of replication in the lungs40,47. Although IDV pathogenicity seems different among mouse strains as well as viral strains48, since D/OK grows well in respiratory organs of BALB/c mouse model, we used this mouse strain to evaluate the live vaccine potential of rD/OK-AL. We found no viral replication in the lungs of mice after three and six days following inoculation with rD/OK-AL. However, minor viral replication was observed in the nose of mice on day three following inoculation, demonstrating that rD/OK-AL acquired high temperature sensitivity, which was facilitated by mutations introduced, under in vivo as well as in vitro settings. Because the core body temperature of cattle, the main host of IDV, is between 38–39 °C, it was hypothesized that rD/OK-AL does not replicate in the lungs of cattle, leading to its attenuated phenotype in this animal.Although the rD/OK-AL showed weak growth in the nasal turbinate, sufficient immune response to protect against the challenge with wild-type D/OK was observed in animals following the rD/OK-AL inoculation. This was in contrast to subcutaneous injection of the formalin-inactivated D/OK for which immunogenicity may be insufficient to protect against the wild-type virus challenge. An inactivated candidate vaccine incompletely inhibited disease progression in cattle32, consistent with our findings corresponding to formalin-inactivated D/OK. Although the inactivated vaccine induces the production of IgG antibodies in sera of immunized animals, which could block viral growth in lungs as shown in our study (Fig. 3C), the intranasal spray type live vaccines would be more effective for protection against IDV infection. Collectively, our results indicate that the rD/OK-AL can be a highly promising candidate strain for the development of an attenuated live vaccine for IDV infection and controlling BRDC. Studies on ts phenotypic stability, pathogenicity, immunogenicity including cellular immune response, and protective effect of rD/OK-AL in cattle are required to evaluate its potential for live IDV vaccine.The IDVs formed five phylogenetical clades, as determined based on the HEF genes49,50. Antigenic heterogeneities among some of these clades have been reported49,51. Our constructive strategy involving IDVs with high-temperature sensitivity will be applied to develop any viruses with selected HEF segments for vaccines generated by reverse genetics with the common use of internal RNA segments containing PB2 and PB1. This will aid in the vaccine production designed according to the epidemiology of IDV infection in each country. In addition, this type of live IDV vaccine can be included in the widely used live vaccines for BRDC containing bovine herpesvirus type 1, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, and bovine respiratory syncytia virus, unless there is interference between IDV vaccine candidate and the existing tri-valent BRDC vaccine. This might act as a more effective mixed vaccine for BRDC.MethodsCells and virusesHuman rectal tumor HRT-18G cells (obtained from ATCC, CRL-11663) and swine testis (ST) cells (obtained from ATCC, CRL-1746) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C. D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK) (GenBank accession numbers JQ922305-JQ922311) was kindly provided by Dr. B. Hause (Kansas State University). D/OK was propagated in ST cells in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM; Life Technologies/Gibco, Paisley, UK) containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (MEM/BSA) supplemented with 0.5 µg/mL L-1-tosylamido-2-phenyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA) and stored at −80 °C.Plasmid constructionvRNA-synthetic plasmids (pPol-D/OK-PB2, -PB1, -P3, -HEF, -NP, -M, and -NS) comprising cDNAs of D/OK viral genes between human RNA polymerase I promoter and mouse RNA polymerase I terminator and eukaryotic protein expression plasmids (pCAGGS-D/OK-PB2, -PB1, -P3, and -NP) under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter were used for reverse genetics as described previously38. To generate mutant recombinant viruses, vRNA synthesis plasmids (pPol-D/OK-PB2 and -PB1) with PB2 and PB1 segments were modified. We constructed pol-D/OK-PB2-AL by replacing the 494th codon in pPol-D/OK-PB2 from GTG (encoding valine) to CTC (leucine). Similarly, pPol-D/OK-PB1-AL was constructed by replacing the 267th codon of pPol-D/OK-PB1 from AGA (arginine) to AAT (asparagine).Reverse geneticsReverse genetics was performed as previously described38, with some modifications. Briefly, 60% confluent HRT-18G cells were transfected with different amounts of 12 plasmids (0.6 µg each of pPol-D/OK-PB2, -P3, and -NP, 0.1 µg each of pPol-D/OK-PB1, -HEF, -M, and -NS, and 1.0 µg each of pCAGGS-D/OK-PB2, -PB1, -P3, and -NP) on a 6-well plate using PEI MAX (Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA). The DNA samples and 11 µL of transfection reagent (1 µg/µL) were mixed and incubated at 23 °C for 20 min. The mixtures were then added to the cells, followed by incubation at 33 °C or 37 °C. At 24 h post-transfection, the supernatants were removed, and cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM (GIBCO BRL) before the addition of 2 mL of Opti-MEM containing 0.3% BSA. The cells were then incubated for an additional five days at 33 °C or 37 °C. TPCK-trypsin (0.5 µg/mL) was added to the collected culture supernatant, and the mixture was inoculated on ST cells for one hour. The cells were washed twice with MEM before addition of 2 mL of MEM/BSA containing TPCK-trypsin (0.5 µg/mL), and incubated at 33 °C or 37 °C. At five days following infection, supernatants were collected, and viruses were titrated in ST cells via the plaque assay.Plaque assayThe plaque assay was performed as described previously38. Briefly, confluent ST cells on a 12-well plate were inoculated with 0.1 mL of each virus serially diluted in MEM/BSA and incubated for one hour at 33 °C or 37 °C. Cells were then washed with MEM/BSA, covered with 1 mL of MEM/BSA containing TPCK-trypsin (0.5 µg/mL) and 1% Seakem GTG agarose (Lonza Japan, Chiba, Japan), and incubated at 33 °C or 37 °C for two–three days. Subsequently, 30% formalin in PBS (0.5 mL) was added to each well to fix the cells at 4 °C overnight. After formalin and agarose were removed, the cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at 23 °C. After blocking with BlockAce (KAC, Hyogo, Japan), the cells were incubated with anti-IDV mouse immune serum for 60 min, biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibody (#B7264, Sigma) for 30 min, and a complex comprising streptavidin (8 µg/mL) (Fujifilm Wako Chemicals, Miyazaki, Japan) and biotinylated peroxidase (4 µg/mL) (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min. The plaques were visualized using a DAB peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Pathogenicity in miceBALB/c mice (four-week-old, female) were purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). The mice were divided into three groups with nine animals in each group. Mice were anesthetized and inoculated intranasally (20 µL) of rD/OK or rD/OK-AL (1.0 × 105 PFU), respectively. Organs containing nasal turbinates, the tracheas, and the lungs were collected after three and six days following inoculation and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for virus titration via the plaque assay.Inactivation of the virusInactivated D/OK virus was prepared for comparative verification of vaccine efficacy. The virus-containing supernatants from ST cells were purified by low-speed centrifugation to remove cell debris and concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 × g for two hours at 4 °C performed using a P19A rotor (Himac, Tokyo, Japan). The concentrated viruses were resuspended in PBS and layered onto a 20%, 30%, 50%, and 60% discontinuous sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for three hours at 4 °C using a P32ST rotor (Himac). The virus-containing interface between the 30% and 50% sucrose gradient was collected, diluted in PBS, and ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for three hours at 4 °C using a P32ST rotor. Purified virus pellets were suspended in a small amount of PBS and inactivated with 0.03% formalin for one week.Immunogenicity in miceThree groups of nine BALB/c mice (four-week-old, female) each were anesthetized and inoculated intranasally (20 µL) with rD/OK-AL (1.0 × 105 PFU; 4–8 HA units) or subcutaneously (200 µL in PBS) with inactivated D/OK (3 µg; 4096 HA units), respectively. The dosage of the inactivated D/OK was selected by referring to previous IAV studies52,53. The sera were collected after 14 days following inoculation, and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assays were performed for measurement of antibodies against the virus.Hemagglutination-inhibition assayThe HI assay was performed in a 96-well microplate with a U-shaped bottom, as previously described17. Briefly, serum samples collected from mice were treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDEII) (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) to eliminate inhibitors of nonspecific hemagglutination. The serum samples were diluted in RDEII in a 1:3 ratio and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The samples were incubated in a 56 °C water bath for 30 min. The samples were diluted by two folds in PBS and incubated with four hemagglutinating units of D/OK. After incubation, 0.7% suspension of turkey red blood cells in PBS were added to each sample, followed by incubation for 30 min. The HI titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest virus dilution showing complete HI.Virus challenge in miceAfter 21 days following immunization, the mice were inoculated intranasally with 20 µL of wild-type D/OK (1.0 × 105 PFU). After three days following the challenge (day 24), mice (four animals per group; n = 12) were euthanized, and organs containing nasal turbinates, the tracheas, and the lungs were collected for virus titration via the plaque assay.Ethics statementOur animal study protocols were conducted in accordance with the Regulations for Animal Care at the University of Tokyo and was approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of the Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences at the University of Tokyo (approval number P17-107) following the Fundamental Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiment and Related Activities in Academic Research Institutions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan.

Periasamy At least two persons have succumbed to the H3N2 subtype of seasonal influenza, which has infected rising numbers of people since mid-December last year, the Health Ministry has confirmed. After a country-wide surveillance exercise, the Ministry said that it had found at least 451 confirmed cases of H3N2 since the beginning of this year.The first recorded death from H3N2 this year was of an 82-year-old man in Karnataka’s Hassan district. Hire Gowda was hospitalised on February 24 and died on March 1, according to official reports. He was suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure. The second deceased was a 56-year-old lung cancer patient in Haryana’s Jind district who tested positive for the H3N2 virus in January and succumbed to it last week.Patients infected with H3N2 display symptoms similar to COVID-19: fever, cough, breathlessness, wheezing and pneumonia. The Health Ministry has advised social distancing and mask wearing to prevent the spread of the virus. What you need to know about the H3N2 influenza virus currently circulating in India | In Focus podcastTracking flu cases“The Ministry is also tracking and keeping a close watch on morbidity and mortality due to the H3N2 subtype of the seasonal influenza. Young children and old age persons with co-morbidities are the most vulnerable groups in the context of seasonal influenza,” the Ministry’s statement said. An almost real-time surveillance of cases of influenza-like illnesses and severe acute respiratory infections presenting in health facilities is being undertaken by the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme of the National Centre for Disease Control.Also Read |Rising cases of cough and fever linked to Influenza subtype A H3N2: ICMRThe H3N2 case numbers have been confirmed from a pool of symptomatic flu cases, of which over 3.97 lakh were reported in January. In February, this number increased slightly to 4.36 lakh cases. Upto March 9, India has reported over 1.33 lakh cases of flu this month.Of these cases, 15,826 cases worsened and were hospitalised with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) since January. Samples of SARI patients were sent for genomic sequencing to understand the exact strain of virus that has infected them. Seasonal sicknessesAccording to the latest data available on the integrated health information platform, a total of 3,038 laboratory confirmed cases of various subtypes of influenza, including H3N2, have been reported till March 9. This includes 1,245 cases in January, 1,307 in February and 486 cases so far this month.“India every year witnesses two peaks of seasonal influenza: one from January to March and other in the post-monsoon season. The cases arising from seasonal influenza are expected to decline from March end,” the Ministry said. Apart from H3N2, a total of 955 cases of H1N1 virus — better known as swine flu — have also been reported, the Ministry has confirmed. The majority of H1N1 cases were reported from Tamil Nadu (545), apart from cases in Maharashtra (170), Gujarat (74), Kerala (42) and Punjab (28). Free flu drugOseltamivir, a drug used to treat H1N1, has been recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of H3N2 cases as well, the Health Ministry said.“The drug is made available through the public health system free of cost. Government has allowed sale of Oseltamivir under Schedule H1 of Drug and Cosmetic Act in February 2017 for wider accessibility and availability. Adequate logistics is available with the States. However, in case of any emergencies the Indian government has been providing the support to the States to tide over the crisis,” the statement added.On March 11, NITI Aayog will hold an inter-ministerial meeting to review the seasonal influenza situation in the States, and discuss ways to further support them in terms of public health measures, management guidelines and protocols to manage the incresing cases.

Will society listen next time? History saved lives in this pandemic. Will society listen next time? A medical historian whose team’s research on the 1918 flu influenced efforts to “flatten the curve” reflects on what the past three years have taught March 10, 2023 2:03 PM Author | Kara Gavin Red Cross volunteers assembling masks in Boston during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. National Archives and Records Administration, via the Influenza Archive Three years ago, the world stood on the precipice of a pandemic. And as scientists raced to learn more about the virus that caused it, and medical teams tried desperately to save its first victims, nations turned to an unlikely source for protection. History. In those early months, lessons from studying the 1918 influenza pandemic helped save as many as 1.7 million lives in the United States alone, research suggests. Other studies have made even greater estimates of infections prevented worldwide. Those lessons were largely drawn in part from a study based at the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine. The team had found that steps taken in 1918 to reduce close indoor contact, encourage mask-wearing and increase ventilation had reduced the death toll. In early 2020, their data informed efforts to keep the new coronavirus from spreading so quickly that it would overwhelm hospitals and clinics -- a concept the U-M team came to call “flattening the curve.” And it worked, says Howard Markel, M.D., Ph.D., who led the U-M Medical School team that carried out the 1918 flu study with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But now, looking back from the vantage point of three years, it’s clear that efforts to respond to future pandemics must use the recent history of COVID-19 as their main guide, he says. That’s what he and others are now trying to help the Biden Administration’s COVID-19 response team do, by consulting on preparedness and response efforts. “It’s not a matter of if we will have another pandemic, it’s a matter of when,” he said. “No one can tell where it’s going to come from, or when, or which virus – but it will happen.” Learning from 1918 A physician and historian who has written dozens of books and essays on pandemics stretching back centuries, Markel is glad that the lessons revealed by the U-M team’s work had an impact during the height of COVID-19. “History was incredibly helpful when informing us about social distancing, and it was really a privilege to be able to provide the numerical data to show that,” he said. “The participation in efforts to reduce spread around the world, before we had the tools we have now, was really remarkable and made a difference.” Keeping society and healthcare afloat by heeding lessons from 1918 also bought time for scientists and companies to understand the virus, protect hospitals and infrastructure from beign flooded with patients, and develop vaccines and treatments. In less than a year after the novel coronavirus was discovered, the first mRNA and traditional vaccines, and the first monoclonal antibody treatments, became available. The first rapid tests and oral medications were approved for use a few months later. Learning from recent history But the influenza virus and the novel coronavirus are very different from one another. And the political, information, medical and economic environments of the late 1910s and the early 2020s are light years apart. The 1918 influenza research did show that resistance emerged to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masking in public, as Markel’s colleague J. Alex Navarro wrote in a 2020 essay. But it wasn’t anywhere near as vocal and visible as the resistance to mask-wearing and vaccination, and promotion of unproven remedies, that started early in the COVID-19 pandemic, says Markel. The fact that top-level political leaders engaged in this was especially damaging. Future pandemic responses may face the same – or worse, he warns. Similarly, the team’s research showed that easing up on preventive measures too soon – which happened in some cities in 1918 and 1919 – also led to problems, as Navarro wrote in another piece, and Markel and Navarro wrote in the wake of a court ruling in Michigan regarding a governor’s ability to declare or extend states of public health emergency. But in COVID-19 this happened much more broadly, Markel notes. So teams preparing for the next pandemic should harness recent data on the impacts of masking, vaccination and social distancing, and anticipate broad-based resistance to protective measures. At the same time, some positive lessons have emerged from the past three years, he reflects. The importance of basic biomedical research – scientists working in relative obscurity for decades on the biology of the coronavirus and the potential use of mRNA and monoclonal antibodies in vaccines and treatments --- paid off in powerful and rapid ways. The increased communication between the medical community and public health community in the past three years has led to a greater recognition of how social, economic, geographic, political and environmental factors affect a person’s risk of disease and their likelihood of severe illness or death. This newfound attention to the social determinants of health, Markel notes, may make it more possible to treat medicine and public health as a continuum, rather than two separate fields. COVID-19 also revealed major shortcomings in funding for public health infrastructure that leaves society vulnerable to future pandemics, he says. “This could be a golden moment to really fix the public health system -- or not,” he said. Another key thing that wasn’t present in 1918, but that pandemic response must consider now and going forward, is the fact that millions of Americans now live with health conditions that 100 years ago, or even 30 years ago, would have killed them. And that means they’re more vulnerable to infections. “People receiving chemotherapy, transplant patients, or people who are immunocompromised for other reasons, are still at risk right now, especially in light of the new viral variants,” said Markel. “Everyone wants to move on from COVID-19. But if we’re all in this together, then we’re all in this together – not just when it’s convenient for some.” Continuing to develop treatments and vaccines that provide protection against new strains of coronavirus will help protect the vulnerable, he says. It could also help sustain the industrial infrastructure needed to respond to the next pandemic. The U-M team studied a lot of newspaper coverage from 1918 and 1919 to perform their research, because that was the main mass communication method of the day in pre-radio, pre-television days. The COVID-19 experience, says Markel, has shown the importance of using modern communication platforms to get good information out and counteract misinformation that has been rampant, and studying how people get and decide to act on information about health threats. No matter what pandemic disease emerges next, learning lessons from the COVID-19 experience and not succumbing to the “global amnesia” that has happened after previous pandemics, will be critical, says Markel. “As humans, we don’t want to think about scary, terrible things,” he said. “But we need to stick together for the greater good, and have faith in medicine, science and public health. That’s the only way we’re getting out of this pandemic, and the ones that are coming.” More Articles About: Health Care Delivery, Policy and Economics infectious disease Covid-19 COVID-19 Vaccine Preventative health and wellness Community Health Future Think Education MM History Health Lab Explore a variety of health care news & stories by visiting the Health Lab home page for more articles.

Local News Does your dog need a flu shot? Canine Influenza vaccines shots may be hard to find by: Kristen Gallant Posted: Mar 6, 2023 / 06:21 PM EST Updated: Mar 6, 2023 / 06:21 PM EST by: Kristen Gallant Posted: Mar 6, 2023 / 06:21 PM EST Updated: Mar 6, 2023 / 06:21 PM EST SHARE KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — Supply chain issues are not just impacting people, but dogs too. The canine influenza vaccine may be harder to find due to supply chain issues. For many, spring break is right around the corner, and as you plan for your week off some will also need to think about where to board their pets. Some dog kennels require pets to have their canine influenza vaccine. However, that vaccine may be harder to find due to supply chain issues. Cost of downtown Knoxville Smokies stadium balloons to $114 million Canine influenza is very similar to human influenza. It can spread rapidly between pets. Not only does it take time to be fully vaccinated but veterinarians are having a hard time getting their hands on the vaccine in the first place. “We see it most commonly in areas where dogs congregate. So dog parks, exposure to shelters, and dog shows. Those are areas where we see the transmission. Transmission can be quite high in those little pockets, but typically we’ll see pockets throughout the country,” said Dr. Claudia Kirk, a professor of Internal Medicine and Nutrition at UT’s College of Veterinary Medicine. Kirk says she hasn’t heard of any outbreaks of canine influenza here in East Tennessee. However, as people begin to travel for spring break they may want to think about getting their dogs vaccinated for the virus. “Within about 48 hours of us being exposed, we can carry it to our canine buddies or our own pets in our own household,” she explained. “It can be on bowls. It’s transmitted fairly routinely between dogs and cats.” Man dies after tree falls on motorcycle in Campbell County Birchwood Kennels in Powell requires their boarded pets to have the vaccine. “Our vaccination protocol is they have to have canine influenza which is a two-part series,” said Kennel Manager David Boone. “The bordetella we require that every six months, we also require rabies, we require the DHLPP or they can have their DAPPV.” Not only do they have vaccine requirements but they go through a vigorous cleaning process daily like disinfecting food and water bowls. “We never know where a dog has been, we don’t know who a dog’s been in contact with, and so a lot of times a dog may not show signs of symptoms on the first day of drop off but they could show those symptoms two or three days after,” said Boone. Missing Sevierville 19-year-old found dead in Knoxville Kirk says if you’re thinking about going out of town or even to a dog park any time soon, you may want to consider getting your dog vaccinated. “Vaccinations would include generally the first dose and then a second dose about two weeks later and then animals are going to the protected for about two weeks after that,” said Kirk, Boone with Birchwood Kennels says if your veterinarian does not have the canine influenza vaccine, they’ve been in contact with local vets and have a list of places that may be able to help. Kirk also mentioned that not all dogs will need their flu shots. This is mainly if they come in contact with other dogs outside of your home.

(Photo courtesy: Getty Images)India Today Health DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Mar 23, 2023 13:17 ISTIn ShortOne person died in Karnataka from the H3N2 influenza.There have been cases of H3N2 virus reported in North India.The symptoms are prolonged cough, runny nose and sore throat.Every second person is experiencing prolonged post-viral cough, breathlessness and sneezing. One person has already died in Karnataka from the H3N2 subtype of the Influenza virus. In North India, flu cases have been reported in the months of January, February and March. According to Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, Group Medical Director, Max Healthcare & Senior Director, Institute of Internal Medicine, the symptoms of the influenza virus strain are slightly different and a bit more severe than how it was in previous years during the flu season. advertisementALSO READ | Rise in H3N2 and Covid-19 cases: What is the difference between the two respiratory viruses?"Lots of patients are complaining of persistent cough or bouts of cough which keeps going on for many days, sometimes even for weeks after the flu settles. Normally, we don’t see flu cases in North India in the months of February and March. Till now, we are seeing a lot of cases coming in. Seasonality has extended in most countries,” said Dr Sandeep Budhiraja.Most of these cases are caused by the H3N2 virus, a type of influenza A virus, which is severe, but not as epidemical in nature as the deadly H1N1 virus (swine flu).WHAT IS H3N2 VIRUS? H3N2 virus is a type of influenza virus called the influenza A virus. It is a respiratory viral infection that causes illnesses every year. This subtype of influenza A virus was discovered in 1968 in humans. The virus derives from types of protein strains of the influenza A virus - hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA has over 18 different subtypes, each numbered H1 to H18 while NA has 11 different subtypes, each numbered N1 to N11. The H3N2 is a combination of the two protein strains of the influenza A virus. The virus derives from types of protein strains of the influenza A virus - hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). (Photo courtesy: Getty Images) WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF H3N2 VIRUS? The symptoms of the H3N2 virus include cough, runny nose or congested nose, sore throat, headaches, body aches, fever, chills, fatigue, diarrhoea, vomiting and breathlessness. WHAT ARE THE PRECAUTIONS YOU SHOULD TAKE TO AVOID H3N2 VIRUS?To prevent any type of viral infection, precautions include getting vaccinated first. Sanitise your surroundings by washing your hands regularly with soap. Avoid contact with people who are ill or wear a mask. If you are sneezing or coughing, it is advisable to cover your mouth as the viral infection is contagious. WHAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR H3N2 VIRUS?The treatment for H3N2 virus is quite uncomplicated as people should take more fluids and keep themselves hydrated. Regular over-the-counter medications for fever, cough or headaches can be consumed to relieve the symptoms. Annual flu shots for the influenza virus should be administered and taken around this time. If symptoms are severe, visiting a doctor is advisable.

Video Ad Feedback (2017) What is bird flu? 01:12 - Source: CNN CNN — The Biden administration is monitoring what experts say is the deadliest outbreak of bird flu that the US has ever seen, and officials are considering a “range of options” on how to respond. The outbreak is not currently considered a serious threat to human health, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Sebastian Castaneda/Reuters Explosion of sea lion deaths in Peru amid deadly bird flu outbreak Globally, there have only been a handful of cases of avian flu in humans, mostly in people who had direct contact with infected birds or with surfaces contaminated with their excretions. There was one human case last year in the United States, a Colorado man who got sick after culling infected birds. He was isolated and treated with an antiviral. More than 860 total cases of bird flu have been reported among humans in 19 countries since 2003, and more than half of those cases were fatal, according to the CDC. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in February that the risk to humans still remains low. But given the large number of infected birds, he added, “we cannot assume that will remain the case.” There have been 6,356 cases in wild birds in all 50 states, according to the CDC, but there are probably many more. In 47 states, there have been multiple outbreaks among poultry, involving more than 58.6 million birds. It has also shown up in noncommercial backyard flocks, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

The Couvoirs de l'Est company, which sell chicks to stockbreeders, reduced its production to face the falling demand due to risks of bird flu in France. FREDERICK FLORIN/AFP/Getty Images Bird flu isn't a direct threat to humans yet, experts say, but they're keeping a close eye on the virus The disease has shown up in other animals in the US, too, including bears, foxes, raccoon, possums, mountain lions, bobcats and even a bottlenose dolphin. As the virus moves through mammals, chances go up that it could mutate and spread more easily among humans. The CDC is able to watch for the virus in communities through the labs it uses to monitor more typical flu viruses. The agency also told CNN that it is also exploring whether manufacturers might want to make commercial tests for these viruses more broadly available. The Biden administration said it has also been watching the situation carefully. “As a part of the administration’s focus on addressing any infectious disease with urgency and preparedness, we continue to monitor the avian flu outbreak. There are a range of options the United States regularly considers when there is any outbreak that could affect the security and safety of the United States’ food supply,” a National Security Council official told CNN. “Right now, we are focused on promoting and enhancing high-impact biosafety practices and procedures.” Biosafety procedures typically include enhanced disinfection practices for people who work with birds. In November, the CDC recommended that people who interact with birds that look sick – even in backyard flocks – should wear disposable gloves, boots, eye protection and an N95 respirator or a face mask. Lucira Health's at-home COVID-19 and Flu test. Lucira Health FDA authorizes first at-home test that can detect both flu and Covid-19 “CDC continues to take any threat of infectious disease seriously and assesses the avian flu’s current risk to humans as very low. The Department of Agriculture continues to respond quickly whenever the virus is detected among bird populations,” the National Security Council official said. The CDC says the risk assessment tool that it uses to understand a virus’ potential as a pandemic risk determined that if these H5N1 viruses were to mutate into a version that could spread easily and efficiently in people, the pandemic risk is “moderate,” and the public health impact of such an event also would be of moderate severity. “This is why it’s so important that both the public health and animal health side take precautions to limit exposures among animal species and between animals and people, and thus limit the chances that some type of virus reassortment event that may allow these viruses to infect people easily and spread easily between people,” the agency said in an email to CNN. General precautions include containing animal outbreaks and limiting exposure for the public. That includes avoiding close contact with sick birds, cooking poultry fully and not eating raw eggs. Another precaution is to take steps toward a vaccine, just in case, and there are efforts under way. Exploring vaccines for humans and animals Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, and colleagues have been working on a vaccine candidate that could be used in humans if the virus started circulating among people. CALIPATRIA, CA - DECEMBER 18: Snow geese fly over the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, where some 30,000 geese winter each year in the Colorado Desert December 18, 2002 near Calipatria, California. Earlier this month, California's Imperial County rejected a historic settlement among state agencies that would have curbed the arid state's use of Colorado River water, allowing six other states to take their full share from the river. In response, U.S. Interior Secretary Gale Norton is threatening to cut California's share of Colorado River water if the dispute among water agencies isn't resolved by December 31.

The vaccine seems to work well in the lab, he said, and the researchers plan to test it on chickens this spring. The CDC says it recently produced a candidate vaccine virus, an influenza virus that manufacturers can use to make a vaccine, that is nearly identical to a viral protein detected in birds and mammals. It could be used to produce a vaccine for people “if needed.” “Such a vaccine would be expected to provide good protections against circulating H5N1 viruses,” the CDC said. The agency said it has shared this with vaccine manufacturers. For years, the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, a division of the US Department of Agriculture, has also been working on a vaccine for potential emergency use in animals. There may be an advantage to vaccinating poultry to reduce the chances that the virus could mutate. Vaccinating poultry against avian flu, is “not something that’s really done in our country, but I think it’s time to think about that for sure,” Hensley said. Farm animals, including birds, are already vaccinated for other diseases. Chickens, for example, routinely get vaccinated for Marek’s disease, which caused by a herpesvirus. They’re also vaccinated against Newcastle disease, a respiratory illness; infectious bronchitis; and acute necrotic proventriculitis, a viral disease that affects the immune system. Avian flu may someday be included in that list, according to a spokesperson for the USDA. “In the interest of leaving no stone unturned in the fight against (highly pathogenic avian flu), USDA continues to research vaccine options that can protect poultry from this persistent threat,” the spokesperson told CNN. Vaccination, though, is not the first option.

So first and foremost, “we are pursuing collaborative efforts with poultry farmers and companies on education, training, and implementation of comprehensive biosecurity measures. Biosecurity is the best and most prudent approach we have to mitigate the impact of the disease today.” CNN’s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.

Along with this, doctors are also seeing symptoms of prolonged tiredness as well as breathlessness in some patients. “Usually, the flu season begins in September and peaks in November. After December-January, the cases dip slowly. But this year, the flu season is still not over, and the infection continues to spread. During November and December, we saw H1N1 cases. As weeks passed, we are seeing H3N2 and influenza B cases. Now, there is also a mixture of viruses circulating such as rhinovirus and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus),” Suresh Kumar, consultant, Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals, said. Flu cases have been on the rise for the last 60 days, according to Koushik Muthu Raja, professor of Respiratory Medicine at Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Hospital. “On an average, I am seeing around 10 to 15 patients per day in the outpatient department and 10 cases in emergency. The cases have doubled when compared to December,” he said. Staying on guardWith no let-up in the influenza cases in the city, doctors say that persistent cough is a predominant symptom, and have stressed the need for masking, and annual flu vaccinationSome of the main symptomsCoughTirednessFeverRunny noseBody acheSore throatBreathlessness and wheezingWhat doctors adviseStay hydratedRest for 24 to 48 hoursCover mouth while coughing, sneezingWear mask to prevent the spread of infectionSeek medical in case of breathlessnessElderly, those with co-morbidities must take extra caseTake the flu vaccineNoting that it was unusual for flu cases to extend up to March, V. Rajendran, professor of Medicine, Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, said, “The predominant symptom is a non-productive cough that lasts for a minimum of one week. The symptoms settle down in most people. However, those with asthma, co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and pregnant women and elderly persons should be careful,” he said. The basic difference is in the cough, which does not seem to subside any soon, say doctors. “Cough lasts for three to four weeks. Similarly, weakness and tiredness. The transmission risk is very high especially among family members. We are seeing elderly patients with breathing difficulties, requiring intensive care unit admission and oxygen support, and taking time to settle down,” Dr. Suresh Kumar pointed out. Cough increasing at night, runny nose, sore throat, fever, tiredness, rare episodes of breathlessness and wheezing are the main symptoms, Dr. Muthu Raja said, adding that they do tests on influenza panel that include both H1N1 and H3N2.“The reasons for the unusual numbers could be change in viral strains and low respiratory immunity after COVID-19. Flu vaccine is not widely taken. I would recommend it for people with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, immunity issues, smokers and those aged above 60 years. It will definitely reduce the symptoms and hospitalisation,” he said. Dr. Suresh Kumar said there was ‘mask fatigue’, and people have stopped wearing masks. “Maybe, due to the continuous use of masks for two years during COVID-19, some temporary immunity existed. People, especially the elderly, who were regularly taking the flu vaccination did not take in the last two years. This could also be a reason for more flu cases now. So, mask adherence and vaccination are important,” he said. Though the flu virus was not affecting the lungs, risks cannot be taken, Dr. Rajendran said, adding: “It is better to watch till the symptoms subside. Whoever is symptomatic should wear a mask to prevent spread of infection.” Published - March 07, 2023 12:59 am IST Read Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINTTop News Today0 / 0 Read in App The Hindu About Us Code of Editorial Values News Archive Sitemap Print Subscription Digital Subscription Subscribe to Newsletters Rss Feeds Readers Editor-Terms of Reference Authors & Contributors Frame Front page Contact us Contact Us Social Media Advertise With Us Group News Sites Business Line BL on Campus Sportstar Frontline இந்து தமிழ் திசை The Hindu Centre Young World Club The Hindu ePaper Business Line ePaper Crossword + Free Games Other Products RoofandFloor STEP Images Classifieds - Print Bookstore & Special Publications Popular Sections Elections Israeli–Palestinian conflict 2023 Latest News National News International News Videos Life & Style Food Podcast Showcase Opinion Editorial Columns Comment Cartoon Letters Interview Lead Business Agri-Business Industry Economy Markets Budget Sport Cricket Football Hockey Tennis Athletics Motorsport Races Other Sports Sci-Tech Science Technology Health Agriculture Environment Gadgets Internet States Andhra Pradesh Karnataka Kerala Tamil Nadu Telangana Cities Bengaluru Chennai Coimbatore Delhi Hyderabad Kochi Kolkata Kozhikode Madurai Mangaluru Mumbai Puducherry Thiruvananthapuram Tiruchirapalli Vijayawada Visakhapatnam Trending on The Hindu News Assam Accord case LIVE (Oct 17) Tamil Nadu rains LIVE (15 Oct) Kolkatan who returns to Durga Puja after 20 years EC to announce schedule for Maharashtra, Jharkhand polls Waqf row Did not want to blow up India ties: Justin Trudeau RSS, Togadia decide to work together to ‘unite’ Hindus EC orders Maharashtra to remove GRs India Canada row Trending on Group sites Stock Market Live Updates Stocks to buy today Hockey Mogun Bagan Paralympics 2024 Gold Rate Today Silver Rate Today Sexual Harassment in Telugu Film Industry Mango: The Michael Jackson of Fruits Frontline Current Issue Terms of Use Privacy Policy Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

India NewsReported by Nehal Kidwai, Parimal KumarUpdated: March 10, 2023 5:06 pm ISTAround 90 cases of the H3N2 virus have been reported in the country.New Delhi: Two persons have died of influenza caused by the H3N2 virus, the government said today. One person has died in Haryana and the other in Karnataka. An 82-year-old man in Karnataka's Hassan is believed to be the first to die of H3N2 in the country. Hire Gowda was admitted to hospital on February 24 and died on March 1, according to officials. He was reportedly a diabetic and suffered from hypertension.The Haryana patient was a 56-year-old lung cancer patient who had tested positive for H3N2 in January. He died on Wednesday at his home in Jind, according to reports.Around 90 cases of the H3N2 virus have been reported in the country. Eight cases of the H1N1 virus have also been detected.The Union Health Ministry said cases are expected to decline by March-end. It also said it is tracking and keeping a close watch on infections and deaths.Cases of flu have been rising in the country over the past few months. Most of the infections are caused by the H3N2 virus, also known as the "Hong Kong flu". This virus causes more hospitalisations than the other types of flu in the country."Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses which circulate in all parts of the world, and the cases are seen to increase during certain months globally. India every year witnesses two peaks of seasonal influenza: one from January to March and the other after the monsoon. The cases arising from seasonal influenza are expected to decline from March-end," the health ministry said.Only H3N2 and H1N1 infections have been detected in India so far. Both have symptoms similar to Covid, which infected millions across the world and caused 6.8 million deaths. After two years of the pandemic, the rising flu cases have triggered concern among people.The symptoms include persistent cough, fever, chills, breathlessness and wheezing. Patients have also reported nausea, sore throat, body-ache and diarrhoea. These symptoms can persist for about a week.According to experts, the virus is highly contagious and spreads through coughing, sneezing and close contact with an infected person.Doctors have advised Covid-like precautions, including regular washing of hands and masks. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) urges covering one's mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing, plenty of fluids, avoiding touching the eyes and the nose, and paracetamol for fever and body ache.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comThe infection may be severe for high-risk groups like older adults and younger children, besides people with weakened immune system because of chronic medical problems.The Indian Medical Association recently urged doctors not to prescribe antibiotics to patients before confirming whether the infection is bacterial, as they can develop a resistance.Also ReadWhat Is A Tripledemic?

Here's all you want to know about differences in symptoms, incubation period and more. Cases of persistent cough, fever and Covid-like symptoms are on rise in the last few days across the country and experts say it may be linked to H3N2 influenza, a subtype of virus that causes flu and leads to more cases of hospitalisations compared to other strains. While the fever in most of the cases lasts for a few days, cough could persist for up to three weeks. The symptoms are related to upper airway including persistent cough, headache, fever, and sinus-related symptoms. Considering Covid hasn't completely vanished, and one needs to be sure, testing is important. However, there are some differences in the symptoms and incubation period of influenza and Covid-19 that can help you differentiate. (Also read: H3N2 influenza in India; tips to prevent infection while playing Holi) H3N2 influenza vs Covid-19: Know the symptoms, incubation period, severity and m (Getty Images/iStockphoto) "Both Influenza and Covid are viral illnesses, but they are totally different in terms of viral families. Currently, in India, there is a surge of the Influenza A family variant H3N2 among adults and Influenza B and Adenoviral infections among paediatric age groups. This pattern is mainly as a result of the last few years, as we have not been exposed to subclinical influenza infections due to masking, and the entire focus being on Covid," says Dr. Shivanshu Raj Goyal, Consultant, Respiratory Pulmonology & Sleep Medicine at Artemis Hospitals, Gurgaon. Dr. Kuldeep Kumar Grover, Head of critical care & Pulmonology - CK Birla Hospital, Gurgaon says fever, chills, cough and cold are common in both while shortness of breath can be experienced more in case of Covid than influenza. Dr Grover adds that headache, muscle aches are common in both, while fatigue is more in Covid. Apart from this stuffiness of nose, sneezing, sore throat, loss of smell is seen in both the viral infections. Earache, nausea, diarrhoea are again common symptoms of both Covid and H3N2 influenza. "Influenza and Covid are both contagious viral illnesses which cause a range of symptoms from no symptoms to mild cough and cold to severe illness affecting lower respiratory tract. The virus can also cause fever, body like headache, vomiting, diarrhoea and loss of taste and smell. The clinical features and investigations and radiology findings are also very similar in both the viruses. Influenza shows more seasonal trend," says Dr Vineeta Taneja - Director - Internal Medicine- Fortis hospital Shalimar Bagh. A cough that just doesn't go away"In terms of symptoms, at present, most patients with influenza have presented with upper airway symptoms such as persistent cough, headache, fever, and sinus-related symptoms. After the initial period, fever settles, and cough persists for at least 2 to 3 weeks. This makes patients very miserable in terms of continuous coughing and throat discomfort. Most patients have been taking cough syrups and anti-allergic," says Dr Goyal. Incubation periodDr Grover says influenza has shorter incubation time and is more like a common viral infection. Symptoms may appear very fast in patients when they get infected, and the incubation period can be around 24 hours and the patient is likely to have upper respiratory symptoms. In case a person is diabetic, or old and has other such morbidities, they may experience more serious symptoms. The incubation period for influenza is 1-4 days, while that of Covid is around 1-14 days. Vaccines for Covid and FluTo prevent influenza, one must get their flu shots while to cut the risk of Covid-19, one must get Covid vaccine as per protocol, says Dr Grover. "Vaccinations place a very important role in preventing severe life-threatening. Illness is vaccination for influenza is the yearly vaccine and should be given to all children, adults with is commodities or everyone more than 60 years of age. Covid vaccination and boosters Are given to the entire population as a government led programme," says Dr Taneja. How to differentiate between flu and Covid"The only way to differentiate between flu and Covid is by doing a nasal examination to identify the viral antigens. It is important to differentiate between the two as the specific anti-viral medication required for the two were different," says Dr Taneja. "As a saving grace, among adults, lung involvement has been rarely seen among influenza patients, in contrast to paediatric kids are getting sicker and often needing ICU admissions. Covid, in contrast, has got every kind of presentation, right from basic cough to severe pneumonia leading to respiratory failure and even death, as seen in the second wave of the Delta variant," says Dr Goyal. Severity of Covid and influenza"The severity of illness in both the influenza and the Covid cases range from very mild to very severe life-threatening illness and can depend on the immunity of the patient, age, commodities etc," says Dr Taneja. Dr Goyal says it is crucial to maintain a high level of immunity by nutrition, hydration, and timely vaccination for Covid or annual flu. "Please contact your doctor at the earliest and avoid over-the-counter medication abuse," concludes Dr Goyal. Follow more stories on Facebook & Twitter Catch every big hit,...

This graph compares flu-related hospitalizations so far this season with last season.Ohio Department of HealthBy Julie Washington, cleveland.comCLEVELAND, Ohio — During the last few winters, flu seasons have been mild. But this season, the flu rebounded to levels not seen since well before the COVID-19 pandemic.The current influenza season began earlier than usual, peaked early and was responsible for high hospitalization rates among children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.It also brought more flu-related hospitalizations and deaths among adults than were seen during the last two flu seasons.“This flu season has really taxed us,” said Dr. Prakash Ganesh, medical director for the Cuyahoga County Board of Health. “In November, December and January, we were seeing the highest number of cases we’ve seen in a long time.”So far this season, Cuyahoga County has seen 16 flu-related deaths, including two pediatric flu deaths. That’s close to being on par with the 2017-2018 flu season, when there were 21 flu-related deaths at this point in the season.At this same point in past flu seasons, Cuyahoga County had zero flu-related deaths in 2022, one in 2021, and fewer than 10 in 2020 and 2021.Local hospitals have been busy with influenza patients, said Dr. Amy Edwards, pediatric infectious disease specialist at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital. Part of what made the flu season feel so bad this year is that it arrived after a busy seaon for RSV, another wintertime respiratory virus that affects small children the most.“We were kind of already tired by the time flu got here. So that made it a little hard,” Edwards said.Influenza season stretches into May, and will cause more deaths and hospitalizations.But here’s a ray of sunshine. Often when the flu season starts early, a second wave comes in February or March. But this year, the flu doesn’t seem interested in returning for a second wave, Edwards said.Across the region, more flu-related deaths have been recorded so far this season, than were seen during the entire 2021-2022 influenza season — when more people were masking and staying away from others as a precaution against COVID-19.Lorain County has recorded six adult flu-related deaths, compared to one last season. And Lake County has recorded four influenza-related adult deaths this season, compared to only one death during the 2021-2022 season.In Summit County, there have been 15 adult flu-related deaths this season, compared to three last season.Medina County has seen five adult flu-related deaths this season, compared to zero in the winter of 2021-2022.Information was not immediately available for Ashtabula, Geauga or Portage counties.Across Ohio, there have been five pediatric flu-related deaths this season, and 8,829 influenza-associated. hospitalizations, according to state health data. The state does not track adult flu-related deaths.If more Ohio residents had gotten a flu shot, the season might have been milder. This season’s flu vaccine was a good match against the influenza viruses in circulation, health experts said.The level of protection generated by this year’s flu shot was relatively strong against the dominant influenza A/H3N2 viruses, according to new data presented recently to the CDC.The vaccine’s effectiveness ranged between 45% and 55%, depending on the person’s age and other factors, news reports said. The flu shot reduced the risk of illness resulting in a doctor’s visit by 54% in people under age 65, and symptomatic illness by 71% among children.The levels of protection generated by this year’s flu shot have been higher than what has been seen in other recent years when H3 predominated, according to news reports.In the future, doctors will be able to offer one shot that protects against flu and COVID-19. But federal officials are backing off earlier reports that it would be ready for this fall’s winter respiratory illness season.The Food and Drug Administration is working to develop data to reassure the public that receiving both vaccines simultaneously is safe, according to news reports.Lack of immunity, lack of sick leave fueled flu spreadReduced natural immunity, lack of prevention measures and distrust of vaccines are among the reasons why influenza cases and deaths rose this season, health officials said.While getting the flu doesn’t mean you won’t get it again, some data suggests that frequent exposure mitigates other flu seasons and so the fact that we haven’t really been exposed in the last couple of years probably also contributed to the flu season.Negativity surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine, combined with vaccine fatigue, discouraged more people from getting the flu vaccines, health officials said.“There’s a lot of hesitancy and questions regarding any vaccines that we offer in our clinic now that we didn’t see before,” Ganesh said.As of January 2023, about 47% of American adults were immunized against influenza, according to the CDC. In Ohio, about 44% of adults had gotten the flu shot. While that’s above the 44% of American adults had gotten the flu vaccine by January of last year, it’s still less than half of adults in the United States, according to the CDC.While mask mandates weren’t in effect last flu season, more people were masking voluntarily than this season.And during the prior 2021-22 flu season, when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its height, more people stayed home with COVID-19 or flu because they were more aware of the dangers of spreading germs, Edwards said.Now, people have run out of sick leave, or feel that they can’t take more time off from work and daily activities, so they don’t stay home, Edwards said.RECOMMENDED•cleveland.comEast Cleveland man accused of illegally voting in seven electionsNov. 11, 2024, 11:01 a.m.Ohio COVID-19 cases dip to lowest level since June; Coronavirus update for Nov. 7, 2024Nov. 7, 2024, 3:21 p.m.Julie Washington covers healthcare for cleveland.com.

Study: Bacterial and viral infections among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, COVID-NET, 14 states, March 2020–April 2022. Image Credit: Nhemz/Shutterstock Background Respiratory infections are often associated with bacterial or viral coinfections due to alterations in the immune system during the initial respiratory infection or damage to the lung mucosa. While sometimes these coinfections increase the severity and mortality rates, often these infections are incidental. Severe influenza infections have been known to result in complications such as bacterial coinfections. Still, secondary infections or co-infections with bacteria have been generally rare in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Therefore, there is a paucity of information on the risk factors, prevalence, and clinical outcomes associated with viral and bacterial coinfections in COVID-19 patients. About the study In the present study, the researchers used data from a surveillance platform based on a geographically diverse large population from the United States (U.S.) known as Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), which comprises data from 250 hospitals from 14 U.S. states. The data from this platform consists of all COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections, demographic characteristics, comorbidities, results from bacterial and viral testing, chest imaging, and a wide range of outcomes, including critical care, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. A cross-sectional analysis included all adults above the age of 18 that were hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infections and were tested for bacterial pathogens from respiratory or sterile sites. The sites in individuals that tested positive for bacterial infection were classified as sputum, blood, deep respiratory (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, endotracheal aspirate, lung tissue, or pleural fluid), and other sterile sites, which included bone, cerebrospinal fluid, and peritoneal fluid. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to test for viral coinfections such as rhinovirus or enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A, B or of unspecified subtypes, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, and human coronaviruses that were seasonal. Associations between having bacterial coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 infections and worse clinical outcomes, such as the need for mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care units, or death, were analyzed. Furthermore, the study also compared demographic and clinical characteristics between patients who had and did not have bacterial coinfections. Additionally, the prevalence of viral coinfections or secondary infections was also calculated. Results The results reported that out of the 36,490 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a little more than half (53.3%) has available bacterial cultures within a week of hospital admission, and of these 6% had coinfections with clinically relevant bacteria. Furthermore, bacterial coinfections within one week of hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 infection were associated with a 2.3 times higher risk of mortality as compared to patients who had negative bacterial pathogen test cultures.

The most frequently detected bacterial pathogens were Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus. Among the Gram-negative rods, the most frequently identified bacteria in sputum samples were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the deep respiratory samples, Escherichia coli were also detected, while in blood samples the two most frequently detected bacteria were S. aureus and E. coli. Demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race, and ethnicity were not associated with an increased risk of bacterial coinfections. Still, comorbidities such as renal disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, gastrointestinal or liver disease, obesity, and cardiovascular disease were linked to a higher risk of having bacterial coinfections. Among the 25.5% of the COVID-19 patients tested for other respiratory viruses, 0.1% tested positive for influenza, while 0.01% tested positive for the respiratory syncytial virus. The other most frequently detected virus was rhinovirus or enterovirus. Two hospitalized COVID-19 patients tested positive for another viral and bacterial infection within one week of admission. Conclusions Overall, the results suggested that while the prevalence of bacterial coinfections among individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 was low (6%), and the prevalence of viral coinfections in the group was lower (0.9%), there was an increased risk of mortality associated with developing a bacterial coinfection within one week of hospitalization. Individuals with comorbidities were also more susceptible to bacterial coinfections. Journal reference: Shah, M. M., Patel, K., Milucky, J., Taylor, C.

It is a subtype of the Influenza A virus and has been responsible for several influenza outbreaks in the past.There has been a sudden surge in the number of H3N2 influenza cases in New Delhi, where people are experiencing symptoms similar to those of prolonged illness and coughing. This increase in cases is reportedly due to the prevalence of H3N2 Influenza in the state. The weather shift from extreme cold to warm is also contributing to the prominence of flu symptoms among people.Symptoms of H3N2 influenza include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue.

In India, the rise in H3N2 influenza cases has been rapid in recent weeks, with flu-like symptoms among people due to the change in weather from extremely cold to warm. In this article, let’s understand the basics of the H3N2 virus and information about its symptoms, treatment, and prevention.India has recorded its first two deaths due to the Influenza A subtype H3N2, one each from Karnataka and Haryana, official sources said on Friday. More here.H3N2 Virus SymptomsThe new flu virus can reportedly make people sick with respiratory conditions, and the H3N2 virus symptoms include chills, coughing, fever, nausea, vomiting, throat ache, sore throat, an ache in muscles and body, diarrhoea, sneezing, runny nose and more.H3N2 Virus Treatment RegimenThe treatment regimen for the Hong Kong flu includes resting, drinking lots of fluids, and using over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower fever. If a patient has severe symptoms or is at a high risk of complications, a doctor may also recommend antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir and zanamivir.How To Prevent H3N2?In order to prevent H3N2 influenza, you must take precautions such as getting vaccinated for the flu each year, washing hands with soap at regular intervals, keeping your distance from the infected, wearing a mask in public, and avoiding going to crowded places unless necessary.How Does H3N2 Spread?The H3N2 influenza virus is very contagious and can be easily spread from one individual to another through droplets that are released in the process of coughing, sneezing, or talking by an infected person. The virus can also spread if a person touches their mouth or nose after coming into contact with a surface that has the virus. Moreover, it’s important to note that pregnant women, young children, elderly adults, and people with underlying medical issues are at a greater risk of flu-related complications. To lower your chances of catching the virus, you should avoid crowded situations and use a face mask, wash your hands frequently with soap and water, avoid touching your mouth or nose, adequately cover your mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing, use paracetamol when you have a fever and body ache, and keep yourself hydrated by drinking plenty of liquids. You should not spit in public areas, use contact-based greetings such as shaking hands, self-medicate, eat while seated next to other people, and take antibiotics or any other medications without consulting a doctor.Disclaimer: This article is not shared as medical advice.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said that the Influenza A subtype H3N2 is the major cause of current respiratory illness in the country.seasonal flu: Image used for representational purpose onlyInfluenza A H3N2 is a seasonal virus and the occurrence of influenza infections normally peaks during season changes. Karnataka has reported first death from influenza A H3N2 in the state after a octogenarian from Hassan becomes first victim of the virus in the state, Press Trust of India said. Another death was also reported from Haryana, the report said, citing sources. According to WHO, seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses. There are 4 types of seasonal influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B viruses circulate and cause seasonal epidemics of disease. Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes according to the combinations of the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA), the proteins on the surface of the virus.Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientists have said that the current spike in persistent cough, sometimes accompanied by fever, cases in India for the past two-three months is due to Influenza A subtype H3N2. They also said that H3N2 causes more hospitalisations than other subtypes. In symptomatic cases, ICMR scientists said they should wash hands with soap and water, wear masks and avoid crowded places, cover mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing, avoid touching eyes and nose, take plenty of fluids and take paracetamol for fever and bodyache.How H3N2 virus can be detected H3 N2 virus can be diagnosed through laboratory testing. "The sample for laboratory testing of H3N2 is similar to the sample collected for COVID-19 testing that is the nasal swab and pharyngeal swab. The method of testing for H3N2 is also similar to COVID-19 testing, that is RT PCR test. The report is generated within a few hours of sample collection. If an individual is tested positive for H3N2, the physician usually administers medication in form of antiviral drugs and other flu medications," says Dr Dangs Lab on its website.FinanceAI and Generative AI for FinanceBy - Hariom Tatsat, Vice President- Quantitative Analytics at BarclaysView Program Web DevelopmentMastering Full Stack Development: From Frontend to Backend ExcellenceBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FinanceFinancial Literacy i.e Lets Crack the Billionaire CodeBy - CA Rahul Gupta, CA with 10+ years of experience and Accounting EducatorView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Generative AI for Dynamic Java Web Applications with ChatGPTBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program AstrologyVastu Shastra CourseBy - Sachenkumar Rai, Vastu ShashtriView Program Web DevelopmentAdvanced Java Mastery: Object-Oriented Programming TechniquesBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Basics of Generative AI: Unveiling Tomorrow's InnovationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Data ScienceMySQL for Beginners: Learn Data Science and Analytics SkillsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentIntermediate Java Mastery: Method, Collections, and BeyondBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI and Analytics based Business StrategyBy - Tanusree De, Managing Director- Accenture Technology Lead, Trustworthy AI Center of Excellence: ATCIView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Mastering C++ Fundamentals with Generative AI: A Hands-OnBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program MarketingFuture of Marketing & Branding MasterclassBy - Dr. David Aaker, Professor Emeritus at the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, Author | Speaker | Thought Leader | Branding ConsultantView Program Data ScienceSQL Server Bootcamp 2024: Transform from Beginner to ProBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentMaster RESTful APIs with Python and Django REST Framework: Web API DevelopmentBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program MarketingModern Marketing Masterclass by Seth GodinBy - Seth Godin, Former dot com Business Executive and Best Selling AuthorView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)ChatGPT Mastery from Zero to Hero: The Complete AI CourseBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Office ProductivityMastering Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 365By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FinanceA2Z Of MoneyBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView Program Web DevelopmentIntermediate C++ Skills: Master Pointers, Structures and File StreamBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Data ScienceSQL for Data Science along with Data Analytics and Data VisualizationBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Symptoms of H3N2 virus Dr S Chatterjee, senior consultant internal medicine at Apollo Hospital, said that the cases of respiratory tract infections have risen considerably in the last couple of months.

Download PDF Copy By Dr. Chinta SidharthanReviewed by Aimee MolineuxMar 9 2023 In a recent study posted to the bioRxiv* preprint server, researchers evaluated the antimicrobial efficiency of two commercially available disinfectants containing quaternary ammonium compounds against influenza A virus (hemagglutinin 1 neuraminidase 1 (H1N1)), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and human coronavirus 229E. Study: Residual Sanitization of Three Human Respiratory Viruses on a Hard, Non-Porous Surface. Image Credit: PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek/Shutterstock *Important notice: bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. Background Seasonal human respiratory viruses such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus cause morbidity and loss of productivity and result in school absenteeism annually. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in the initiation of worldwide disease mitigation measures such as social distancing, mask-wearing, hand washing, and disinfection of surfaces. Enveloped respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza are thought to be transmitted primarily through airborne aerosols, and their survival in aerosol droplets is dependent on factors such as absolute and relative humidity and temperature. SARS-CoV-2 is considered viable after deposition on non-porous surfaces in low temperature and humidity conditions for several days. Enveloped viruses are susceptible to inactivation by disinfectants containing alcohol, quaternary ammonium compounds, and surfactants. However, it is important to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of commercially available disinfectants to ensure that self-sanitizing claims of disinfectants containing quaternary ammonium compounds are valid. About the study In the present study, the researchers evaluated the self-sanitizing properties and antimicrobial effectiveness of two quaternary ammonium compound-containing commercially available disinfectant sprays in situations involving abrasion of surfaces and reintroduction of the viral pathogen. H1N1 influenza A virus, the USA-WA1/2020 isolate of SARS-CoV-2, and human coronavirus 229E were used to test the efficiency of two disinfectants — test formulations A and B (TF-A and TF-B). A control consisting of sterile deionized water was also used. Pre-sanitized glass carriers were sprayed from a distance of six to eight inches at a 45° angle using a spray device supplied by the disinfectant manufacturer. All carriers were coated five times with the disinfectant or control and allowed to cure overnight at 45% to 48% humidity and 20–23°C temperature. Carriers that exhibited 100% coverage after curing were used for the abrasion test. One carrier per disinfectant and control was also used for assessing the cytotoxicity on the host cell and neutralization validation. The test and control carriers were inoculated with the test virus and incubated. Following a dry abrasion cycle using cotton wipers and foam liners, the carriers were reinoculated with the test virus. Subsequently, the carriers underwent a wet abrasion cycle, followed again by reinoculation with a test virus. The dry and wet abrasion cycles were repeated 12 times. The carriers were then neutralized and rinsed to obtain the viral suspension, which was used to determine the residual sanitizing activity of the disinfectants. Results The results reported that the performance of TF-A was variable, with a high level of inactivation of human coronavirus 229E but lower efficiency in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 influenza A virus. In contrast, TF-B, which carries the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) claim of 99.9% residual efficacy against bacteria was consistently effective against all three test viruses. Related StoriesStudy uncovers OLAH as key driver of fatal respiratory diseaseRecruitment underway for a clinical trial testing new vaccine against respiratory virusesHigh blood pressure found to increase airway resistance and affect lung functionDespite 12 rounds of wet and dry abrasion cycles and repeated viral inoculations, TF-B continued to provide self-sanitizing properties to the glass carriers. While TF-A achieved higher than 3-log10 inactivation against human coronavirus 229E, TF-B showed reductions greater than or equal to 3-log10 against all three viruses. Infectious aerosols containing influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 have been found in public places and confined air spaces containing infected individuals, and the right combination of environmental factors can keep them viable for a while on surfaces after deposition. Although the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through fomites has been determined to be low, protective behaviors such as disinfection of surfaces should be continued. While previous studies have focused on the effectiveness of embedded materials such as titanium dioxide or specialized polymers in self-disinfecting surfaces, these findings suggested that commercially available disinfecting sprays, especially one carrying a U.S. EPA label of 99.9% residual kill claim, were effective in providing disinfectant properties after abrasion and viral reinoculation. Conclusions Overall, the findings suggested that commercially available disinfectants containing quaternary ammonium compounds varied in their effectiveness against enveloped respiratory viruses, but a disinfectant spray with the U.S. EPA claim of 99.9% residual effectiveness, consistently inactivated all the test viruses, even after 12 rounds of abrasion. *Important notice bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. *Important notice: bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

But how will you differentiate between the two and what sets the adenovirus apart? The rise in adenovirus cases has shaken up West Bengal which reported the death of 36 children over the past nine days. While Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has assured people that only two deaths were linked to adenovirus, reports of cases, especially in children, have caused worry among parents in this post-COVID world. ALSO READ | New viral infection cases causing throat ache, persistent cough, fever spike across India However, it doesn't end there as doctors are also reporting a 2.5x rise in patients with acute respiratory symptoms of what seems to be a strain of a viral infection since this time last year. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), this could be caused due to Influenza A subtype H3N2. So how do these two illnesses differ? Adenovirus and influenza are two common viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses, but they have distinct differences. Adenovirus is a highly contagious virus that can cause a range of illnesses, including the common cold, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Adenovirus infections typically cause symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, and pink eye. However, they can also cause more severe illnesses, especially in people with weakened immune systems. ALSO READ | West Bengal on alert: What is adenovirus, what are its symptoms, causes and prevention On the other hand, influenza or the flu is a respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. The flu is also highly contagious and can spread through close contact with infected individuals, contaminated surfaces, or airborne droplets. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention noted that the flu can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and fatigue. In some cases, it can also lead to severe complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis and even death. One of the main differences between adenovirus and the flu is the severity of the illness they cause. While both can cause serious complications, the flu is generally more likely to lead to severe illness and hospitalisation, especially in vulnerable populations such as young children, elderly adults, and people with underlying health conditions. In contrast, adenovirus infections are more likely to cause mild to moderate symptoms in healthy individuals. Another difference is that there is a vaccine available for the flu, but not for adenovirus. The flu vaccine is recommended annually for everyone aged six months and older, and it can help reduce the risk of getting the flu or lessen its severity if you do get it. There is currently no vaccine available for adenovirus, so prevention efforts mainly focus on good hygiene practices such as hand washing and avoiding close contact with infected individuals. ALSO READ | West Bengal issues advisory as adenovirus cases rise — boosts surveillance at hospitals In conclusion, adenovirus and the flu are distinct viruses with different symptoms, transmission routes and treatment options. The recent surge in adenovirus cases in India, particularly in West Bengal, highlights the need for increased surveillance and monitoring measures to track the spread of the virus and contain outbreaks. Doctors also advice maintaining good hygiene practices to prevent the spread of adenovirus and other respiratory infections. In India, the adenovirus situation has been particularly severe in the state of West Bengal, where the number of adenovirus cases has increased significantly in recent weeks, causing concern among health authorities. However, the administration released an advisory last week assuring parents that there is no reason to panic.Continue ReadingFirst Published: Mar 6, 2023 4:14 PM ISTCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

Updated: March 10, 2023. Note: Information in this article was accurate at the time of original publication. Because information about COVID-19 changes rapidly, we encourage you to visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and your state and local government for the latest information. A major concern for parents this past fall was how to protect their kids in what was shaping up to be a “tripledemic﻿”—the chance of flu﻿, COVID-19﻿, and RSV﻿ (respiratory syncytial virus) happening at the same time and sending more people to already overstretched hospitals. But in the first weeks of the new year, the situation had changed: While COVID-19 is on the rise, flu (while still circulating) is declining after an early surge. Meanwhile cases of RSV are plummeting. The last several months are still concerning, however. Kids got sick earlier than usual last fall, and in higher numbers. Common colds and other viruses that nearly vanished during the pandemic came back, and children with respiratory viruses crowded emergency rooms in some parts of the country. This winter, fewer people have been practicing infection control, even as the highly contagious Omicron and its subvariants (like the recent XBB.1.5) continue to circulate. Doctors believe that relaxing mitigation efforts have opened the door to non-COVID diseases, which have been behaving erratically—for instance, causing infections at odd times of the year. Yale Medicine experts answered some common virus questions on parents’ minds.1. What viruses should parents be concerned about this winter?“We're paying attention to everything,” says Thomas Murray, MD, PhD, a Yale Medicine pediatric infectious diseases specialist. He notes that many types of viruses circulate among kids in a given year, including influenza and rhinoviruses, which cause common colds and are not typically worrisome. But there are many other viruses that parents should look out for, including: RSV, which causes cold-like symptoms and can lead to serious complications in young children. It has landed up to 60,000 children in the hospital in pre-pandemic winters—in the season when it is most common. RSV seemed to disappear in 2020-2021, then returned off-season in the spring and summer last year. It flooded many children’s hospitals this past fall. Adenoviruses, which are common and usually cause mild cold- or flu-like symptoms. It's worth noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently has a Health Alert Notice for clinicians and a media statement for parents as it investigates a rise in cases of hepatitis of unknown origin in children; some of the cases tested positive for adenovirus. Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), which causes symptoms that may include fever, runny nose, and cough. Patients usually recover on their own. However, HPIV also can cause more severe illness, such as pneumonia. Human parechovirus (PeV), a common virus that causes fever, rash, and respiratory infection. But a variant known as "type three" (PeV-A3) can be life-threatening to young infants. The CDC issued a health advisory in July 2022, when the virus was found circulating in multiple states, and urged pediatric health providers to monitor for the disease in newborns and babies younger than a year old who show signs of severe illness. Enterovirus D68, another virus that experts are monitoring, most commonly affects infants, children, and teenagers, and can pose especially serious risk for children with asthma. This virus also is suspected of causing a polio-like disorder called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). Although small numbers of the virus have been reported since 1987, the CDC reported outbreaks between August and November in 2014, 2016, and 2018. Interestingly, there was no outbreak reported in 2020, the first year of the pandemic. “So again, we're always vigilant for different viruses like this,” Dr. Murray says. Mpox (formerly known as monkeypox), a rare disease, similar to smallpox, but less severe, that has recently been spreading mostly in men who have sex with men. Pediatricians are on alert because its spread during this outbreak is so unusual. It causes such symptoms as chills and fever, and sometimes a very painful rash. “Right now, the probability that your child's rash is going to be mpox in the absence of a known exposure is pretty low,” says Dr. Murray, adding that other illnesses, like chickenpox, can cause a similar rash. Families should always notify their pediatrician about exposures to mpox or any other unusual disease, he adds. 2. What does it mean when viruses appear during an ‘off-season’?There has been a heightened sense of unpredictability around all infectious diseases.The timing of influenza cases in 2022 was an example of erratic viral behavior. In May, at the end of a mild pandemic flu season, cases ticked upward when they should have petered out, and the season extended into June, which is rare, Dr. Murray says. The Yale Clinical Virology Laboratory produces weekly virus summaries that provide a small snapshot of other odd viral activity. In one week in July 2022, for example, the summary included RSV, flu, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, HMPV, rhinoviruses, PeV, and norovirus, most of which are rarely seen in the summer. These numbers reflect a phenomenon experts are monitoring around the world. While the numbers were low—only one case of PeV that week, for instance—it is still worth noting that those types of infections occurred off-season, Dr. Murray explains.3. Are "off-season" viruses more severe?Early last fall, Dr. Dias said that, as far as individual infections were concerned, the answer seemed to be no. “I think we're seeing potentially the same percentage of people getting admitted to the hospital, but a larger number because there are just more people getting sick right now.” Viruses tend to spread themselves out, and it is unusual for kids to get more than one virus at a time. But some young patients admitted to Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital in 2022 were diagnosed with two or even three viruses at the same time. “We have seen that before, so it's not completely unusual, but it does seem to be happening more now than it did before,” Dr. Dias says. 4. Should parents still worry about the coronavirus?Yes. COVID-19 cases began to rise again toward the end of November, and in early 2023 the highly contagious Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5. was spreading rapidly throughout the country. In the Yale virology report ending the week of Jan. 1, there were 681 COVID-19 cases. Children tend to experience mild disease with COVID-19, but prevention remains important, since a number of children have died from the disease, explains Dr. Dias. (According to the CDC﻿, around 1,700 deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in those under 18 since 2020.) Some also develop long COVID, a condition marked by lingering symptoms that is not yet well understood, she adds.5. What symptoms should parents look for?Many respiratory infections share similar symptoms, and Dr. Murray doesn’t expect those symptoms to be different than in previous years. “They include high fevers and difficulty breathing. If there is a new rash or you are worried about your child’s breathing, you should make the pediatric provider aware,” he says, adding that some symptoms can be signs not only of viruses, but also of other bacterial infections and/or typical baby infections.In the case of COVID-19 and flu, the CDC lists a wide range of symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, runny or stuffy nose, fatigue, sore throat, and even loss of taste or smell (although the latter is more frequent with COVID-19). In both cases, symptoms can vary from person to person: Some children have no symptoms at all; others have cases that range from asymptomatic to mild to severe. 6. When should a parent call the pediatrician?While it’s not necessary to call about every symptom, some can be confusing, says Dr. Murray. “Any time a parent is concerned, it's best to call and be reassured.”It may also be important to call the doctor if a child has a chronic medical condition, since that puts them at higher risk for severe symptoms or complications from viruses. The same goes for young babies, Dr. Murray adds. Parents should also contact their pediatrician if a baby younger than three months old has a fever or is difficult to console. “If they’re cranky and you hold them and they settle down, that’s fine. But if you hold them and they're still absolutely irritable—and you cannot calm them down no matter what you do—that's a baby that needs to be evaluated,” he says.7. How can doctors diagnose a child when there are different viruses with similar symptoms?If a child has respiratory symptoms, the first thing a pediatrician will do is recommend a COVID-19 test. “The symptoms for many of these diseases overlap considerably,” Dr. Murray says. “So, it can be virtually impossible for a doctor to tell the difference between COVID-19 and another virus without a test.”If the COVID test is negative, it’s helpful to know that mild colds or viruses usually start to get better in a few days, but if symptoms get worse, the doctor might consider testing your child for the flu, which can benefit from treatment. Testing for RSV is done mostly for surveillance purposes. But it’s also helpful in deciding whether to isolate a child from other children if they are in the hospital, or at home with a sibling who either has a chronic medical condition that puts them at risk or is a very young baby.8. How can parents treat kids for these illnesses?While each virus is different, many of the common respiratory ones respond to the same types of therapy, explains Dr. Murray. “If the COVID test is negative, most of the time parents just need to make sure that the baby or child is OK—and that their breathing is OK—and provide supportive care,” Dr. Murray says. They should make sure their children are well-hydrated, and give them over-the-counter medicines, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, if they have a fever, he adds. “The vast majority of kids are going to do fine with that.” If their symptoms continue, parents need to talk to the health provider again, he adds.9. How can parents help their kids to stop coughing?“If they're above age 1, we recommend giving a teaspoon of honey, which has been shown in clinical trials to actually help with cough,” says Dr. Dias. “They usually cough the most when they're sleeping because they're lying flat, and that position disturbs the child from sleep.”For children ages 1 and older, she also advises putting two pillows under the child’s head or raising the head of the bed so they are sleeping on an angle “so that gravity can help phlegm flow downward,” she adds. 10. Why are COVID-19 and flu vaccines important for kids and when should they get them?“Vaccination is really the number one tool that we have for preventing many infectious diseases,” says Dr. Dias. When so many viruses are circulating, it can reduce confusion, she adds. The COVID-19 vaccine followed by a bivalent booster shot decreases the risk of hospitalization and death, and children ages 6 months and older can get vaccinated anytime. For influenza, however, the CDC recommends getting the flu vaccine before the end of October, although it’s still available and recommended after that. (Some children ages 6 months through 8 years will require two doses of the flu vaccine.) While the flu shot is not always a perfect match for the predominant strain in a given year, it’s a strong tool for preventing an infection that can be deadly in some children. Also, it can mean the difference between mild and severe illness in a child who gets sick despite getting the vaccine. There is no vaccine yet to prevent RSV infection, but several are in development. If possible, Dr. Murray encourages families to schedule a wellness checkup to assess their children’s overall health and to update them on immunizations they may have missed during the pandemic, including vaccinations against measles, pertussis (whooping cough), and other diseases. “When the vaccination levels in the population go down, these viruses do come back,” says Dr. Murray. He adds that measles, in particular, is “super contagious and kids can get quite sick from it.”11. How do you keep children healthy without worrying them?Mental health issues among kids are a major concern, says Dr. Murray. Parents should avoid piling new worries on top of any anxiety kids may already have about school. “The primary mission now is to figure out how to do things as safely as possible, because it’s important for everyone’s mental health.” He recommends having conversations about mental health or anything kids have on their minds. “You can also take time to talk at dinner, go for an evening walk, or go for a hike on the weekends," he says. "Spend time talking to your kids about how they're doing.” As far as the infections, Dr. Dias says most kids will do well. “Viruses have always been out there, and kids are generally resilient in fighting infections, even when they are hospitalized,” she says. “But vaccination and regular checkups with the pediatrician can provide the support needed to help your kids get better.”Information provided in Yale Medicine articles is for general informational purposes only.

Photo: iStockDTE StaffPublished on: 07 Mar 2023, 4:49 amCopiedAcross India, an outbreak of a respiratory illness — with symptoms of cold, sore throat and fever accompanied by fatigue — has been observed since late December 2022 and early January 2023. By March, cities like Delhi had reported widespread cases of this illness. What is causing this illness?On March 4, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) confirmed that Influenza Sub-type H3N2 has been causing this illness. In the first nine weeks of 2023, cases of H3N2 have been rising, according to ICMR data. Since December 15, this virus has been the dominating one circulating. “At least 92 percent of the hospitalised SARI (severe acute respiratory infections, patients observed by the agency) patients detected with the virus were showing up with fever and up to 86 per cent have cough. Additionally, 27 per cent progressed to breathlessness and 16 per cent showed wheezing symptoms. Also, 16 per cent had signs of pneumonia and 6 per cent presented with seizures,” the ICMR said in a media statement.

The circulating strain of that virus is now H3N2 and, therefore, it is a normal influenza strain,” Randeep Guleria, the former head of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said in an interview with agency Asian News International (ANI).In June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the H1N1 pandemic. This is also popularly referred to as the swine flu pandemic.The first cases were reported in North America in April 2009. By the time WHO declared it a pandemic, it had already spread to 74 countries.The WHO had then said: Before the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, the influenza A (H1N1) virus had never been identified as a cause of infections in people. Genetic analyses of this virus have shown that it originated from animal influenza viruses and is unrelated to the human seasonal H1N1 viruses that have been in general circulation among people since 1977. In August 2010, WHO declared the end of the swine flu pandemic, considered one of the shortest pandemics. Since then, the novel virus has gone through many mutations and the swine flu pandemic was officially declared ended in August 2010.“There are four types of seasonal influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B viruses circulate and cause seasonal epidemics of disease,” according to WHO. The novel virus that caused the 2009 pandemic is a type A one and is named A (H1N1) pdm09. The H1N1 (2009) virus continues to circulate as a seasonal virus and is included in the vaccines against seasonal influenza.“Influenza A viruses are the only influenza viruses known to cause flu pandemics (i.e., global epidemics of flu disease),” according to the US nodal agency Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The influenza A H3N2 virus also caused the 1968 pandemic that killed over a million people. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, “1968 flu pandemic, also called Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 or Hong Kong flu of 1968, global outbreak of influenza that originated in China in July 1968 and lasted until 1969–70. The outbreak was the third influenza pandemic to occur in the 20th century; it followed the 1957 flu pandemic and the influenza pandemic of 1918–19. “But why are we now getting this outbreak so widely? “We are seeing more cases because as the virus mutates a little bit, the immunity that we had against the virus becomes a little less and therefore, people who are susceptible tend to get infection more easily,” Guleria told ANI.

This is frightening considering 405 persons succumbed to the flu in 2012. While the government has gone into an overdrive to reduce the number of cases, data from studies carried out by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi shows that there is no need to panic. The behaviour of the swine flu virus strain has become akin to seasonal influenza, say doctors,” reported Down To Earth. Influenza has affected humans for over 6,000 years, causing pandemics at regular intervals. During the 1918 Spanish flu, it was thought to be a bacteria until an American physician Richard Shope identified the virus in 1931, according to an article on non-profit media outlet The Conversation.

In exceptional cases, the fever might get cured in three days also, said the doctors.“People are concerned as the symptoms of influenza are similar to those of Covid-19 virus. It is common in people aging 50 to 15 to experience seasonal cold or cough from October to February. Air pollution is one of the precipitating factors. Self-control and regulation needs to be practised by all. One should avoid crowded places, maintain respiratory hygiene and take the vaccination,” said the medical practitioners. Dr Kumbha Yugandhar, a noted Pulmonologist of Vijayawada said, “About 80% of the patients are coming to the hospital with developed upper respiratory infections along with fever. We observe that the cold hits them at first, followed by continuous headache, fever for one to two days, then body pain and finally the cough persists. Simple antibiotics are needed to cure continuous cough and body ache, but people are taking antibiotics as they used to take during the pandemic, which is not advisable.”According to the Indian Medical Association, doctors, specially Rural and private medical practitioners should not prefer antibiotics, instead prescribe Crocin or Paracetamol for fever and Leo Citizen etc for cold. Speaking to TNIE, Dr C Srinivasa Raju, State president of the Indian Medical Association said, “People start taking antibiotics like Azithromycin and Amoxiclav etc, which needs to be stopped as it leads to antibiotic resistance.”Dr Raju also stated that several other antibiotics are being misused for certain conditions and are developing resistance among patients.“The most misused antibiotic drugs are Amoxicillin, Norfloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, Ofloxacin and Levofloxacin. We need to diagnose the type of infection first,” he added.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestCOVID 19fluShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

H3N2 influenza viruses began circulating in humans in 1968 and have evolved substantially since.Typically, flu seasons dominated by H3N2 activity are more severe, particularly among at-risk groups such as older adults and younger children.SymptomsThe symptoms of H3N2 include cold, cough and throat pain. Air pollution makes the H3N2 strain worse. It is easily contagious and has increased the number of hospitalisations for influenza. According to ICMR researchers, feverish upper respiratory infections are a common occurrence in people and may be made worse by air pollution. Coughing, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, body aches, and diarrhoea are additional typical symptoms.How serious it is?Of the hospitalised SARI patients down with influenza A H3N2, about 92% reported fever, 86% cough, 27% breathlessness and 16% wheezing.Another 16% had clinical signs of pneumonia and 6% seizures. Ten percent of SARI patients, having H3N2, needed oxygen support while 7% required ICU care.How is it different from the common flu?Of the four â A, B, C and D â influenza viruses A and B cause the seasonal epidemics of flu, a respiratory illness, that occur every year.Some influenza A subtypes â H1N1 (or, swine flu virus) and H3N2 â can cause more severe illnesses.At riskA survey published in Nature shows that H3N2 virus infections produce non-neutralising H3N2 antibodies, particularly among middle-aged.The Indian Medical Association says people over 50 and below 15 are more vulnerable, and air pollution could be a precipitating factor.Dos and Don'tsThe IMA has issued a note of caution against misuse of antibiotics amid a spike in flu cases in India. It has said many people are taking antibiotics on their own to manage fever and coughs which can be due to the seasonal influenza.ICMR says antibiotics should be prescribed by doctors to ensure that they are not given beyond the recommended duration.About the AuthorMini ThomasA health journalist for over 15 years, Mini is currently an Assistant Editor at The Times of India.

(Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press)Social SharingA Port Maitland property with a small backyard flock is the epicentre of Nova Scotia's latest bird flu infection. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) declared the outbreak on Saturday after testing confirmed a number of species of birds were infected at what the agency has classified as a "non-commercial premises."According to CFIA regional veterinary officer Margaret McGeoghan, "This was a small flock of mixed poultry, about 20 birds in total."The flock of ducks, geese, chickens and guinea fowl has been killed.The infected zone includes all of Port Maitland in southwestern Nova Scotia  and an area with a roughly three-kilometre radius around the infected site.A larger restricted zone stretches from just north of Yarmouth to Salmon River and includes all the land in between, from Highway 101 to the western coastline. Permits are required to move birds, eggs or bird products through the zone which is roughly 10 kilometres in radius.Avian influenza was detected in the province in February at a "non-poultry, non-commercial" site. The last case of avian influenza in a commercial poultry operation in Nova Scotia was in March 2022.According to a CFIA fact sheet on avian influenza, this virus "can affect several species of food-producing birds (chickens, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl, etc.), as well as pet and wild birds." Although it spreads quickly and is often fatal among birds, transmission to humans only happens "on rare occasions" according to the CFIA.To feed or not to feed?

From: Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Animal and Plant Health Agency and The Rt Hon Lord Benyon Published 9 March 2023 This was published under the 2022 to 2024 Sunak Conservative government APHA Weybridge His Majesty The King will visit the Animal and Plant Health Agency today in Weybridge. Staff and scientists to be congratulated for their work combatting the avian influenza outbreak in the UK and support with Ukrainian refugee pet travel. Weybridge is renowned for its specialist research and laboratory facilities, and its world-leading animal and plant health science and disease control capabilities. His Majesty The King will today (Thursday 9th March) visit the Animal Plant and Health Agency (APHA) in Weybridge to congratulate scientists and staff for their work in combating the largest-ever avian influenza outbreak in the UK. There have been over 330 cases of avian influenza confirmed across the country since October 2021. APHA’s world-leading scientists and staff have played vital role in supporting avian influenza diagnostics and disease control. Their work to tackle the outbreak helps protect animal and public health but also supports our international trading relationships. His Majesty The King will undertake a full tour which will involve briefings on some of most difficult animal health diseases the world faces including avian influenza and bovine TB as well as plant health challenges including invasive non-native species. He will visit dedicated specialist research laboratories to see genome mapping and a mosquito laboratory where he will learn about APHA’s vector-borne disease (VBD) programme. Ahead of attending the visit, Lord Benyon, Minister for Biosecurity, Marine and Rural Affairs, said: “The Animal and Plant Health Agency has a long-standing reputation for excellence in the field of biosecurity and the work it does to protect the UK from animal diseases, which in turn supports our economy and food security. “I’m pleased we can use today to showcase our specialist world leading facilities.” Also ahead of attending the visit, Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Christine Middlemiss said: “Today’s visit really is about recognising the last 18 months of remarkable work and the APHA staff who have worked day in and day out to help control and manage the spread of avian influenza. “The scale of avian influenza outbreaks across the UK and Europe has been unprecedented and our response has been underpinned by the world-leading science and disease control work carried out at Weybridge.” David Holdsworth, Chief Executive Officer of APHA, said: “APHA staff work tirelessly day in day out to protect the UK, its people and economy from the growing biosecurity threats we face. They have faced a relentless battle against Avian Influenza over the last two years. So I am pleased to welcome His Majesty The King to Weybridge to meet with APHA staff from Scotland, Wales and England and see first-hand the incredible work they do. “I am proud to showcase our world-leading scientists, field teams and staff and the role they play in protecting the country.” The Government is committed to the strongest possible standards of protection against animal diseases and is investing in the long-term future of the Weybridge facility, including £1.4bn of funding for the Science Capability in Animal Health Programme. The investment is in recognition of the vital work APHA does to contribute to our economic and food security. Alongside the Government’s continued investment in the Avian Influenza National Reference Laboratory and APHA’s Weybridge site, Defra and the Biotechnology and Biosciences Research Council (BBSRC) fund an eight-strong consortium ‘FluMap’ led by APHA that received £1.5 million in funding to develop new strategies to tackle avian influenza outbreaks. His Majesty The King will also meet APHA staff who were instrumental in helping those fleeing from Ukraine to safely bring their pets into the UK. APHA staff worked tirelessly to enable Ukrainians to bring much loved family pets with them to the UK while keeping the country safe from diseases such as rabies. The UK has some of the highest biosecurity standards in the world. We have taken swift action to protect poultry from the threat of avian influenza. Avian Influenza Prevention Zones (AIPZs) are in force across the UK with additional mandatory housing measures in force in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These enhanced biosecurity measures which apply to all bird keepers have been vital in successfully protecting flocks across the country from avian influenza.

Deaths from H1N1 commonly known as swine flu have been reported from Haryana (2), Kerala (2), Maharashtra (2), Punjab (2) and Tamil Nadu (1) in January with 451 cases excluding data from West Bengal. While there is a hue and cry over the H3N2 variant that has claimed 2 lives one each in Karnataka and Haryana, several other respiratory diseases including a considerable number of swine flu cases are being reported from across the country, which was behind the flu pandemic in India in 2009. Meanwhile, the union health ministry said that till 28th February, a total of 955 H1N1 cases have been reported, the majority from Tamil Nadu (545), Maharashtra (170), Gujarat (74), Kerala (42) and Punjab (28). Perturbed over various respiratory illnesses increasing in India, Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, union health ministry on Saturday wrote a letter to states mentioning that while Influenza is an annual seasonal occurrence, in the present season, a variety of weather conditions and behavioural reasons (like less than adequate attention to personal hygiene, sneezing and coughing without adequate protection in close proximity of other people, closed indoor gatherings of people, etc.) make the environment conducive to circulation of a number of viral respiratory pathogens like Influenza A (HIN1, H3N2 etc.) and adenoviruses, etc. The health secretary also said that while the covid-19 trajectory has decreased substantially in the last few months, the gradual rise in covid-19 test positivity rates in some States is a concerning issue that needs to be promptly addressed. “Additionally, since 1% January, 2023, as per testing of respiratory samples being undertaken by various Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) virus research and diagnostic laboratories (VRDL) network labs, almost 25.4% of the samples have tested positive for Adenoviruses,” said Bhushan. The government said that near real-time surveillance of cases of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) presenting in OPDs and IPDs of health facilities is undertaken by Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) and NCDC. According to the latest data available on the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme -integrated health Information Platform (IDSP-IHIP), a total of 3038 laboratory-confirmed cases of various subtypes of Influenza including H1N1 and H3N2 have been reported till 9th March 2023 by the States. This includes 1245 cases in January, 1307 in February and 486 cases in March (till 9th March). “Under IDSP, as reported by States/UTs, an increasing trend of ILI/SARI is being observed across the country. Further, as per integrated sentinel based surveillance of ILI and SARI, an upswing of Influenza A is observed since latter half of December, 2022. Of particular concern is preponderance of Influenza A (H3N2) being detected in the samples being analysed in various labs. It should also be keptin mind that young children, old age people and people suffering from co-morbidites are particularly at risk and vulnerable to HIN1, H3N2, Adenoviruses, etc,” said Bhushan. “While most of these agents typically cause a similar mild and often self-limiting illness manifesting acute respiratory infection with fever and cough, in some cases, particularly old age people, people with obesity and other co-morbidities (like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic renal and liver disease etc.), as well as pregnant females may suffer from a more severe manifestation of these diseases requiring hospitalization,” said Bhushan. Further, the IDSP-IHIP data from health facilities indicate that during the month of January 2023, a total of 397,814 cases of Acute Respiratory Illness/Influenza Like Illness (ARI/ILI) were reported from the country which increased slightly to 436,523 during February 2023. In the first 9 days of March 2023, this number stands at 133,412 cases. The corresponding data for admitted cases of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is 7041 cases in January 2023, 6919 during February 2023 and 1866 during the first 9 days of March 2023.

The analysis is in line with the findings in other parts of the country. Usually, the fever cases come down in January.Dr S Chandrasekar, Professor of Medicine at Government Stanley Medical College said that children are more affected than adults, with symptoms including fever, sore throat, body pain, tiredness, and cough lasting for at least three weeks.WATCH |Representative imageDr Janani Sankar, Deputy Medical Director, Kanchi Kamakoti Child Trust Hospital said, “Per day, the hospital is getting over 100 fever cases. But most of the cases are mild, and children are recovering in a few days.”According to sources, the State Public Health Laboratory tested around 50 samples with influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms in February and found the predominant circulation of Influenza A Virus (H3N2), followed by respiratory syncytial virus and adenoviruses, which are common respiratory pathogens. Dr T S Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health, told TNIE that samples of ILI cases were taken from Chennai and its neighbouring districts and tested. “The viruses are expected to come under control in a few days. Elderly people and those with compromised immunity should avoid public places. Even if they go out, they should wear a face mask,” he stated. The DPH said in a report that the increase in ILI cases is not due to Covid-19 and swine flu (AH1N1). “The predominant cause is due to Influenza A virus (subtype A(H3N2)), which is a common respiratory pathogen, causing seasonal flu,” he said.“The primary cause of the outbreak is the Influenza A virus, specifically the subtype A(H3N2), which is a common respiratory pathogen responsible for seasonal flu. It is classified clinically as mild (A), moderate (B), and severe (C). Patients in category C, who are elderly and have comorbidities along with respiratory distress, can be easily treated with Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) tablets. The current cases mostly fall under category A, and we have sufficient stocks of Oseltamivir available,” the DPH said in the report.Additionally, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type A/B is also circulating in the community and causing flu-like illness, which is typically self-limiting. The DPH advised all patients with fever to seek medical attention at nearby government primary health centers and other health facilities in both rural and urban areas for proper management of their symptoms.The State Public Health Laboratory tested ILI cases targeting 21 respiratory viruses. Among the ILI cases investigated, 50% were caused by Influenza A virus, followed by 37.5 % caused by respiratory syncytial Viruddh A/B.TN Health Minister Ma Subramanian announced that 1,000 fever medical camps will be conducted across the state on March 10, with 200 camps in Chennai alone. In areas with more fever cases, mobile medical units will be sent to screen people. All fever patients are advised to visit nearby government primary health centers and other health facilities in both rural and urban areas to get proper treatment for fever management.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestTamil NaduFEVERShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

Statesman News Service | New Delhi | March 7, 2023 1:02 pm Representation image : istock Influenza cases are on the rise in several parts of India, specially in northern India and patients are complaining of prolonged illness, lingering cough and respiratory challenges. Doctors and medical experts explain that this is another type of virus which behaves like coronavirus. Scientists say there could be the possibility of disinfection with influenza or new variants, showing different kinds of clinical scenarios. Although the new wave of this virus is not causing any deaths and hospitalisation, people are threatened by the symptoms. According to Vipasha Thakur, a research scholar at Department of Biotechnology and Microbiology, Punjab University, influenza is a single-stranded, helically shaped RNA virus of the orthomyxovirus family. Advertisement Three types of influenza virus are known to affect humans: A, B, and C. Type A influenza has subtypes determined by the surface antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are 18 different H subtypes and 11 different N subtypes. According to him, eight H subtypes (H1, H2, H3, H5, H6, H7, H9, H10) and six N subtypes (N1, N2, N6, N7, N8, and N9) have been detected in humans. Type B influenza is classified into two lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria. Infection with influenza viruses can be asymptomatic or result in disease that ranges from mild to severe. Influenza B more commonly affects children. Influenza C is rarely reported as a cause of human illness, probably because most cases are subclinical. Influenza C has not been associated with epidemic disease. These novel strains are the influenza virus’s evolutionary adaptations to a strong population-wide immune response. The strain H3N2 variant of this Virus is causing prolonged illness specifically cough. The infection usually lasts for seven days but according to the patients the symptoms are lasting for 15 days to month. The Indian Medical Association informed in a public advisory on March 3, 2023 about the sudden rise in the number of patients having symptoms such as cough, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, fever, body ache and even diarrhea in some cases. It also advised doctors to refrain from prescribing antibiotics, and resorting to symptomatic treatment only. The currently recommended drugs for the H3N2 virus are oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and baloxavir, which are available through prescription. Wearing a mask at a public place is recommended by the Indian medical Association, and isolation is recommended to patients.

Health experts believe that the scare is not bad and if people avoid poultry for a brief period there is no harm. "It is true that almost every strain of virus is temperature sensitive and is likely to be killed when the chicken or infected bird is cooked properly but there are other ways in which the virus can travel from the infected birds to humans," said head department of microbiology at Rajendra Institute of medical sciences (Rims), Dr Ashok Kumar Sharma.Bird deaths have been reported in Jharkhand for the third year since 2020, of which during two instances aviary being infected by H5N1 virus has been confirmed.Every time incident of bird deaths are reported, people give up eating chicken, eggs and ducks out of fear of being infected. Though technically the fear can be described as 'unfound', the precaution exercised is appreciated by the experts of social medicine.Head department of preventive social medicine at Rims Dr Devesh said that several influenza viruses, infecting the humans have come from animals. "Influenza viruses are known to have the characteristics of 'drift and shift' indicating that they mutate easily and no one knows when these viruses mutate and start affecting humans," he said. Kumar explained that the pathogenicity of the virus is high and it is often noticed that it spreads in the barn very fast killing birds in masses. "Prevention is better than cure and it is important to check the viruses within the poultry and prevent it from infecting humans," he said.Sharma said when they are culled it is mainly to prevent healthy birds from getting infected but precaution should be exercised in culling and disposing dead birds. "Those handling dead birds should take every precaution as the viruses are very much active," he said. Sharma added that same applies during dressing and cooking of the chicken or ducks. "Those who dress or cook the flesh are at the risk of picking the viruses, though it becomes inert after being cooked," he said.

Patients are complaining of fever, body ache, headache, cold, sore throat and cough, said Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max Healthcare, and senior director at its Institute of Internal Medicine. Some are presenting with a dry hacking cough, others complain of persistent coughing fits days and weeks after recovering from the infection besides hoarseness.People shouldn't ignore infections as they may need specific therapies such as nebulisers, inhalers, bronchodilators and sometimes even short steroid courses to get better, he said."In a small proportion of these cases, especially those involving elderly patients and those with low immunity, the infection is going down into the chest and causing pneumonia. Some of these people then need to be admitted or hospitalised for treatment of these viral pneumonias," he said. "So one has to be cautious and very careful, especially in children and elderly, and not take it lightly."Those with low immunity and having comorbidities such as cancer, diabetes or taking steroids also need to be careful."Patients who have heart or lung problems and people in extremes of age like children and elderly - these are the group of people who are more susceptible or more at risk of developing a more severe disease," he said. Observing some Covid-era protocols will help, according to Akshay Budhraja of Aakash Healthcare. People should avoid crowded places, practice good hand and respiratory hygiene, take annual flu shots, keep indoor air quality under control, wear a mask when outdoors and avoid home remedies without consultation.Nominations for ET MSME Awards are now open.

Written by Sushmita Panda March 10, 2023 15:01 IST Follow Us Over the past few months, cases of flu have been rising in the country. (Image Credits: Pixabay) H3N2 Influenza in India: Two people have died of influenza caused by the H3N2 virus in India so far. According to reports, one person has died in Haryana and the other in Karnataka. The H3N2 influenza virus is one of the many strains of the influenza virus that can cause illness in humans. Reportedly, India has so far, recorded a total of 90 cases of H3N2 influenza. Additionally, eight cases of H1N1 influenza have also been reported in the country. According to media reports, an 82-year-old man in Karnataka’s Hassan is believed to be the first to die of H3N2 in the country.Also Read How universities are preparing engineers in India to lead the AI race BCCI reviews India’s 0-3 loss to New Zealand: Key decisions on Bumrah’s absence, Gambhir’s coaching style and more J-K: Two village defence guards killed in Kishtwar, second militant attack in 9 days ‘Took remarks positively’: Home Minister after Pawan Kalyan’s criticism of worsening law and order in Andhra According to ICMR scientists, the H3N2, which has been in wide circulation for the past two-three months, causes more hospitalisations than other subtypes. Earlier this month, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), on the other hand, has advised against the indiscriminate use of antibiotics amid rising cases of cough, cold, and nausea across the country. Seasonal fever will last five to seven days, it noted. Also ReadTHIS new flu virus is plaguing India – Know all about causes, symptoms and treatment Over the past few months, cases of flu have been rising in the country. This virus causes more hospitalisations than other influenza subtypes in the country. Only H3N2 and H1N1 infections have been detected in India so far. Both have symptoms similar to Covid, which infected millions across the world and caused 6.8 million deaths. The symptoms include persistent cough, fever, chills, breathlessness and wheezing. Patients have also reported nausea, sore throat, body-ache and diarrhoea. These symptoms can persist for about a week. “Currently India is seeing spurt in Flu cases which declined during Covid-19 pandemic and research attributes this rise due to decline in natural immunity to Influenza viruses(Influenza A and B) and changes in virus resulting in increased infections. Apart from Infuenza viruses, RSV(respiratory syncytial virus) adenovirus and rhinovirus are also responsible for Flu like symptoms. The symptoms range from mild (a sudden onset of fever, cough usually dry, headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise (feeling unwell), sore throat and a runny nose) to severe and even death. The cough can be severe and can last 2 or more weeks. Hospitalization and death occur mainly among high-risk groups (Children below 5, elderly and immunocompromised individuals,” Dr. Renuka Bajaj, Lab Head and Sr. Microbiologist, Ampath, Amritsar, told Financial Express.com. According to Dr. Bajaj, post viral complications like secondary bacterial pneumonia can be debilitating requiring hospitalisation and antibiotic treatment. Seasonal influenza spreads easily, with rapid transmission in crowded areas including schools and nursing homes. “When an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets containing viruses (infectious droplets) are dispersed into the air and can spread up to one meter, and infect persons in close proximity who breathe these droplets in. Though with mild illness there is nothing much to worry about and doctors prescribe symptomatic treatment but those with severe symptoms and high-risk individuals should seek timely medical help, get themselves tested for Flu and other such viruses. These days a number of rapid diagnostic modalities are available for early start of targeted therapy which help such patients in recovering early,” Dr. Bajaj added. WHO recommends annual vaccination for prevention in pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy, children aged between 6 months to 5 years, elderly individuals (aged more than 65 years), individuals with chronic medical conditions and health-care workers. “Apart from vaccination, one should avoid crowded places (wear masks), travel if not necessary, practice good hand and respiratory hygiene,” she said.

Experts share why this is happening.Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementAs symptoms of fever, sore throat, prolonged cough and breathlessness are being reported, doctors have said that the flu cases, this time of the year, are slightly different. (Photo courtesy: Getty Images) Daphne ClaranceNew Delhi,UPDATED: Mar 7, 2023 13:34 ISTIn the northern parts of India, the influenza virus has hit badly as several people are developing more severe symptoms than ever. Experts have cautioned people from standing in crowds, sanitising themselves and getting vaccinated. As symptoms of fever, sore throat, prolonged cough and breathlessness are being reported, doctors have said that the flu cases, at this time of the year, are slightly different. advertisement"Lots of patients are complaining of persistent cough or bouts of cough which keep going on for many days sometimes, even for weeks after the flu settles. Even in the post-viral phase, lots of people have prolonged fatigue, weakness, tiredness, mental fogging, and inability to work and concentrate," said Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, Group Medical Director, Max Healthcare & Senior Director, Institute of Internal Medicine.ALSO READ | H3N2 virus hits India: All you need to know about this viral outbreakHighlighting the fact that normally flu cases like this aren't seen in the months of February and March, Dr Budhiraja said that "seasonality has got extended even in many countries".Commonly called spring influenza, since it is caused by a certain type of influenza virus, also known as the H3N2 virus, the expert said that fever, cough and cold, body aches normally settle down in 3-5 days. However, in the present scenario, even though other symptoms are settling down, the dry hacking bounds of the cough continue."The feature of this virus is that it triggers a certain type of reaction or inflammation in the upper airways or sometimes even in the lungs, partly because it may be allergic or inflammatory in nature," he said. The feature of this virus is that it triggers a certain type of reaction or inflammation in the upper airways or sometimes even in the lungs, partly because it may be allergic or inflammatory in nature, says expert. (Photo courtesy: Getty Images) Dr Budhiraja explained that many people who are not "asthmatic" start behaving like one after contracting the virus."Their airways become hyper-responsive to the viruses that trigger asthma-like situations and give them bouts of cough. These patients have to be treated with a combination of anti-allergic and asthma-like medications which basically help relax the airways and are sometimes given steroids which are more potent anti-inflammatories to reduce the swelling in the airways. Because they do respond to these medications, hence, we can say that this is the virus that is triggering these effects in the upper airways," he underscored.ALSO READ | Spring influenza cases rise with prolonged cough and breathlessness: Symptoms, precautions, treatmentOne of the major things that people should avoid doing when they have a influenza viral infection is consuming over-the-counter antibiotics. "The best way to avoid getting the flu is by avoiding crowded places, practising good hand and respiratory hygiene, annual flu shots, keeping indoor air quality under control, wearing a pollution mask when outdoors and avoiding home remedies without consultation," said Dr GC Khilnani, Chairman, PSRI Insitute of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine. According to the World Health Organisation, the West experienced influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses spreading in several countries between September and January.Published By: Daphne ClarancePublished On: Mar 7, 2023--- ENDS ---ALSO READ | Amitabh Bachchan's rib injury on sets of film - how severe can it be?

As many as 50 out of 200 patients were admitted in a day at Kanpur's Hallet Hospital after they complained of high fever, persistent cough and shortness of breath.There is a long queue of patients not just outside Kanpur's biggest government (Hallet) hospital, but even private hospitals are also struggling with the same. Cases with flu-like symptoms, including high fever, persistent cough and acute respiratory issues, have been reported in Kanpur in large numbers. H3N2, a subtype of influenza A, has been spreading for over a month now.advertisementThe hospital authorities at Hallet were forced to shift patients to different wards after the emergency ward was full. One of the family members of a patient told India Today, "The patient is having difficulty while breathing. We have come from Auraiya to Kanpur for treatment. He had fever for five to six days and also complained of cough. When he started facing difficulties in breathing, we brought him to Kanpur."Another kin of a patient said, "We have come from Kanpur Dehat.

"Talking about the last 24 hours, only 23-24 patients have been admitted complaining of difficulty in breathing, who are being given oxygen support. Some have been put on ventilators and we are also using a bipap machine on some," she added.

It becomes difficult to test it because there is a separate kit for each subtype," she said.

As rain accompanied by thunder in many parts of the city on Monday and Tuesday led to a drastic fall in mercury levels doctors warned against a further rise in cases of cold and cough. (REPRESENTATIVE IMAGE) Existing cases of cough and fever are being attributed to the influenza A subtype H3N2 by scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). This subtype of the influenza A virus was discovered in humans in 1968. It derives from types of protein strains of the influenza A virus namely Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA). While HA has over 18 different subtypes, numbered H1 to H18, NA has 11 different subtypes, numbered N1 to N11. H3N2 is a combination of the two protein strains of the influenza A virus. Dr Pradeep Awate, surveillance officer, state health department, said, “Currently, there is extremely erratic weather in Pune and maximum temperature is three times more than minimum temperature. When such temperature fluctuation is recorded, it is conducive to viral growth. Currently, people are getting H3N2 flu which is a seasonal flu.” “There is nothing to worry but symptomatically, people are facing some problems due to it. Instead of taking unnecessary antibiotics, people should take rest and do saline gurgling or turmeric water gurgling as it is more beneficial than antibiotics,” Awate said. Both Covid-19 and H3N2 are caused by contagious viruses. They can spread through droplets and also mutate significantly. Although both these respiratory illnesses are highly transmissible, they belong to different virus families. While Covid-19 is caused by the SARs-CoV-2 virus, H3N2 is one of the influenza A subtypes circulating in humans. Reportedly, the latter can lead to more cases of hospitalisations compared to other strains. Dr Vijay Natarajan, chief executive officer (CEO), Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre, Lavale, said, “During change of seasons, viral illness always increases and it happens every year. What has made things complicated this year is missing the spring season.” During spring, day temperatures increase to 25 to 30 degrees Celsius while night temperatures rise from 10 to 12 degrees Celsius to 15 degrees Celsius but it did not happen this time. Instead, night temperatures remained low at 8 to 10 degrees Celsius and day temperatures shot up to 37 to 38 degrees Celsius. “Since last month, we have been seeing daily weather fluctuations. So, because of the wide fluctuation in temperature, viral illnesses are increasing. This is the variant of the influenza virus and it does not have any treatment per se,” Dr Natarajan said. “People should wear masks as this is not only for Covid. It is a stronger flu virus and cases are on the rise because of extreme variations in temperature. Mask discipline should be followed by people,” Dr Natarajan said. So far, most influenza patients are reporting upper respiratory tract symptoms including persistent cough, headache, fever, sore throat, running nose, etc. However, what has been noted is a lingering cough that just does not go away. According to the Indian Medical Association, the seasonal fever will last five to seven days but in some cases, the cough can persist for up to three weeks.

Read more on this hereKarnataka Health Minister Dr. K. Sudhakar had said on Monday that 26 persons have tested positive for the H3N2 variant in the state, and among these two cases are reported from Bengaluru. He added that children below the age of 15 years face more danger from the H3N2 variant and that the variant also infects persons above the age of 60 years.Addressing a press conference at the Vidhana Soudha after holding a high-level meeting over the rising Covid cases and H3N2 variant, Sudhakar advised that pregnant women also need to be careful. Sudhakar also said that a total of 60 cases of Adenovirus, which causes acute respiratory infections (ARI), were found in Karnataka. “For six months, the staff of the Health department have not been wearing masks. Right from this day, the staff who work in hospitals and health care centres must wear masks," he said.The country has seen an unexpected increase in Covid and H3N2 cases, which has experts concerned. Despite the fact that reported cases remain quite low, India has seen a 63% increase in cases over the last week. Dr Randeep Guleria, chairman of the Institute of Internal Medicine, Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, and Director of Medical Education, told ANI that the H3N2 virus mutates every year during this time and spreads through droplets. Read more on this hereBut what is H3N2 and how can people protect themselves? News18 explains in 5 Points:1) H3N2 Influenza AThe Indian Council of Medical Research, or ICMR, has identified H3N2 as the origin of the current wave of fever and cold that has afflicted Indians across the country. It is a subtype of Influenza A. According to the US Centre of Disease Control (CDC), when influenza viruses that ordinarily circulate in pigs are detected in humans, they are referred to as “variant" viruses.In July 2011, influenza A H3N2 variant viruses (commonly known as “H3N2v") carrying the matrix (M) gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus were discovered in humans. The viruses were discovered in pigs in the United States in 2010. In 2011, 12 H3N2v human infections were discovered. Several H3N2v outbreaks occurred in 2012, resulting in 309 documented cases. Since then, there have been isolated cases of H3N2v infection, the report says.2) What are the Symptoms?As per CDC, H3N2 infection symptoms are comparable to seasonal flu viruses and can include fever, respiratory symptoms such as cough and runny nose, and possibly additional symptoms such as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea.3) But Does It Cause Serious Symptoms Too?For the past two to three months, the virus has been circulating. According to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) experts who monitor respiratory virus illnesses through the Virus Research and Diagnostic Labs network, it causes more hospitalisations than other subtypes, said an Economic Times report. Experts have advised caution for people with co-morbidity conditions (Image: Shutterstock)As per CDC, even in healthy persons, infections with influenza viruses (especially variant viruses like H3N2v) can cause serious sickness. This can entail consequences (such as pneumonia), which may necessitate hospitalisation and, in some cases, result in death. The health agency also adds that this virus appears to transfer more easily from pigs to humans than other swine influenza viruses.The agency adds that influenza viruses are constantly evolving. It’s probable that the H3N2v virus will evolve and spread quickly from person to person, it says.CDC and other research have also found that children born after 2001 had little to no immunity against H3N2v viruses. Adults appear to be more immune, possibly because they have been exposed to similar viruses in the past, the CDC explains.4) Prevention Better Than CureThe ICMR recommends the following safety precautions:Wearing masksDrinking enough fluidsCovering the mouth while coughing or sneezingAvoiding touching the nose and eyesTaking paracetamol for fever and bodyache to combat the virus (consult your healthcare professional for further advice).5) Treatment: Don’t Over-prescribe Antibiotics, Experts Tell DoctorsAs per Economic Times, the IMA has also requested that doctors only prescribe symptomatic treatment and not antibiotics. The body issued a statement; “people are starting to use antibiotics like Azithromycin and Amoxiclav without thinking about how long they should take them or how frequently they should take them. This must be prevented since it contributes to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics will not work because of resistance whenever they are actually used."With inputs from agenciesThis article is not meant to be a substitute to medical advice.

From: Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, The Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Animal and Plant Health Agency Published 7 March 2023 This was published under the 2022 to 2024 Sunak Conservative government Views sought on new registration rules for all bird keepers in Great Britain. New rules would require all bird keepers to register their birds and update information annually. Proposal is part of government action to tackle avian influenza. Proposals to require all poultry keepers to officially register their birds were launched by the government today (7 March) as part of efforts to tackle avian influenza. The new rules would apply to all keepers, no matter how many birds they have. At present only those who keep 50 birds or more are required by law to do so. They would also be required to update their information on an annual basis. By registering their birds with the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), keepers will ensure they receive important updates such as any local avian influenza outbreaks and information on biosecurity rules to help protect their flocks from the threat of avian influenza. This will enable the government to communicate with bird keepers quickly, to manage potential disease outbreaks, such as avian influenza, and limit the spread. The new rules would cover owners of backyard flocks, birds of prey and pigeon fanciers, but would not affect pet birds kept entirely inside a domestic dwelling, such as a parrot or budgie kept in a cage indoors which never leaves the property other than to visit a vet or another short-term period. In a joint statement the Chief Veterinary Officers from England, Scotland and Wales said: “These proposals will enable us to have a full picture of the number and location of birds kept across Great Britain and make it easier to track and manage the spread of avian disease. “This information will also help inform future risk assessments and maintain our commitment to continually building our extensive avian influenza research portfolio.” British Poultry Council Chief Executive said: “We welcome this consultation as a means of ensuring the GB poultry register is fit to support Government and industry efforts in mitigating the ongoing impacts of avian influenza. Registering your poultry is an effective way of monitoring and controlling the spread of disease to protect the national flock. We, as ever, urge all poultry keepers to remain vigilant for signs of avian influenza in their birds.” The consultation proposals take forward the recommendation from the 2018 Dame Glenys Stacey Review and lessons identified from the 2021/2022 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreak and previous HPAI outbreaks. Bird keepers will need to provide information including their contact details, the location where birds are kept and details of the birds (species, number and what they are kept for). A 12-week joint GB-wide consultation will run until 31 May.

The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) said people are reeling from a persistent fever, cold, cough, headaches, and breathless kinds of symptoms these days. The medical body has clarified the symptoms are not related to the seasonal flu. Seasonal fever will last five to seven days, it said.ICMR experts have suggested that the symptoms are due to Influenza A subtype H3N2. The medical body said that the H3N2 has been in wide circulation for the past two-three months and is more fatal than other viruses. According to Dr Arjun Dang, CEO, Dr Dangs Lab, H3N2 Influenza cases are being reported more in comparison to H1N1. The H3N2 causes more hospitalization and respiratory issues than its other subtypes.In addition to this, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has issued a piece of cautionary advice against the H3N2 virus and directed doctors and pharmacists to avoid the prescription of antibiotics to H3N2 patients.The IMA said, "Right now, people start taking antibiotics like Azithromycin and Amoxiclav, etc, that too without caring for done and frequency and stop it once start feeling better. This needs to be stopped as it leads to antibiotic resistance. Whenever there will be a real use of antibiotics, they will not work due to the resistance".It added that Amoxicillin, Norfloxacin, Oprofloxacin, Ofloxacin, and Levofloxacin are the most misused antibiotics. Such medicines are commonly used for the treatment of diarrhoea and Urinary Tract Infection (URI).H3N2 symptoms:Fever, respiratory symptoms like cough and runny nose, body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea, are some of the common symptoms of the H3N2 virus.Viral cases have also surged due to air pollution, according to the Indian Medical Association. The infection mostly targets people aged below 15 and above 50 and causes upper respiratory infections along with fever.H3N2 treatment and prevention:An expert told Hindustan Times, Livemint's sister publication that children and adults with H3N2 Virus can be treated with Oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and baloxavir, but it is important to take advice from a physician.Besides, to prevent such severe respiratory infections, annual flu vaccination should be obtained.People should wear a mask in crowded places to avoid infection. Regular washing of hands must be taken seriously.If symptomatic, wear masks and avoid crowded places, cover mouth and nose while sneezing and coughing, take plenty of fluids, avoid touching eyes and nose, and take paracetamol for fever and body acheCatch all the Business News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Viral fever cases saw a spike in the last one month across the state. VIJAYAWADA: Health wing authorities are on high alert after Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) raised concern over the rise in cases of fever linked to Influenza A H3N2, a subtype of viruses that cause influenza (flu).Viral fever cases saw a spike in the last one month across the state. Both government and private hospitals are witnessing hundreds of cases with severe cough, running nose, high fever, burning sensation in eyes and other symptoms related to H3N2.Patients suffering from severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) are becoming prone to fever followed by cough lasting almost two to three weeks. Study conducted by the ICMR showed that 27 per cent of people suffering from SARI are complaining of breathlessness and 16 per cent of patients developed pneumonia, which is an alarming situation. Health department is focusing on identifying the flu cases and providing necessary treatment as per the suggestions of ICMR. Authorities identified that hospitalisation of flu patients is considerably high in this season. Dr. Venkata Krishna, head of general medicine department at GGH, said many patients are recovering only after 10 to 12 days after showing initial symptoms of flu. He added a few cases are showing severe symptoms similar to Covid-19 like shortness of breath, severe cough and body pain. He said doctors are continuing the treatment based on symptoms, and not prescribing high doses of antibiotics as per instructions of ICMR. Health wing authorities have decided to arrange special OP and inpatient units for H3N2 patients at all government hospitals across the state. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) told doctors not to prescribe high doses of powerful antibiotics to flu patients, which will create resistance to certain drugs.Meanwhile, pulmonologists suggest wearing masks when stepping out of homes as the virus is highly contagious. âWe are noticing severe cases where people are facing shortness of breath and sudden fall in oxygen saturation. Instead of contracting the disease, people should take preventive measures such as wearing masks, and avoiding contact with large groups, and public events for a while,â said Dr. Vattipalli Bhagyaraj, a physician from city.About the AuthorVenu LankaVenu Lanka is a special correspondent, at The Times of India-Vijayawada.

While the risks to human health are minimal as of yet, governments and commercial organizations are asking everyone to be vigilant. Worldwide, millions of birds have been infected with the H5N1 virus. According to the Chicken Farmers of Canada, this outbreak is the largest ever recorded.The ongoing avian influenza reporting by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency shows that about half a million birds in Saskatchewan have been infected as of March 1st 2023.

If poultry farms become infected, there could potentially be huge economic damage.“Our chicken farmers prepare for avian influenza every year by following stringent, science-based, on-farm biosecurity protocols.

We have consumers’ trust for good reason, and we continue to work hard to grow the high-quality, safe chicken products Canadians expect.”Dr. Alyson Kelvin, research scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) says most avian flus are mild and often don’t even cause sickness, but the current strain of the virus is particularly aggressive in the bird population, both in symptoms and spread. However, so far, the virus has only posed a very minor threat to human health. Story continues below advertisement “It is uncommon for a virus to cross the species barrier and we have seen that the current strain has a lot of trouble crossing that barrier. However, viruses are always unpredictable, so we are monitoring for changes and virus behavior at the moment. There have been perhaps billions of birds affected worldwide, but there have only been a small handful of cases of H5N1 in people, so we see that as a positive sign that the virus seems to have trouble infecting humans.” Trending Now 1.4M Honda vehicles may see engines fail, prompting U.S. probe How Canadian consumers can spot counterfeit $2 coins The virus has been detected in other animal species, though.

The Ministry of Agriculture is coordinating with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the poultry industry to prepare for any outbreaks during the spring wild bird migration.In a statement to Global News, the Ministry of Agriculture said that they proactively reaching out to producers to reinforce the importance of biosecurity measures and the need to monitor flocks for illnesses. Story continues below advertisement “Poultry owners are reminded to take an active role in protecting their flocks by maintaining high levels of biosecurity, which includes preventing contact between poultry and wild birds — both directly and indirectly through contaminated environments, feed, and water — limiting visitors to barns, using barn-specific clothing and footwear, and regularly monitoring birds for signs of illness.”The Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment also warns the public against handling dead or sick birds.“While the risk of human infection remains low, the public is advised to avoid handling sick or dead birds. They should also report animals showing neurological symptoms or instances of multiple dead animals to the ministry Inquiry Centre at 1-800-567-4224, or through the Canadian Wildlife Health Co-operative Wildlife Health Tracker app.“Hunters should take routine hygiene precautions when handling wild game and cook game meat thoroughly before eating it.” Journalistic standards Comment Report an error © 2023 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

High fever is usually the first sign of influenza virus GURGAON: With a rise in cases of intense cough, runny nose and watery eyes lasting for over a week coupled with fever, linked to Influenza A H3N2 -- a subtype of a virus that causes flu -- the district health department on Sunday directed all community and primary healthcare centres to be vigilant.Over the past few weeks, government hospitals have reported a rise of 30% in the number of cases of influenza, while private hospitals in the city reported a spike of 40%.âWe are witnessing an outbreak of both influenza A (which is dominant) and B cases. It can be seen from the increase in the number of patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and pneumonia (both bacterial and viral) all across the state and NCR in particular. All health centres have been put on aler,âchief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav told TOI.He added that anybody with over 103 F (39.4 C) or higher temperature and breathing difficulties must consult a doctor. âChildren, especially those below 5 years, people above 65 years, pregnant women and people with certain long-term health conditions like asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems and neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions are at a higher risk of developing complications if they get seasonal flu,â the CMO said.On Saturday, the Indian Council of Medical Research quoted surveillance data from December 15 to call Influenza A subtype H3N2 as the major cause of rising respiratory illness in India.According to doctors, the recent increase in seasonal diseases, including H3N2 influenza, was due to a rapid shift in weather conditions. Dr Arunesh Kumar, head of pulmonology and respiratory medicine at Paras Hospital, said, âThere has been an increase in the number of patients coming to the OPD with febrile illnesses, cough and sore throat. On a daily basis, at least 10-15 patients who visit the chest OPD are detected with virus symptoms.âEnd of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous9 things that make Areca Palm the perfect indoor plantLifestyleSoaked moong dal benefits: 10 benefits for eating this energy powerhouse for breakfastLifestyleHow to make South Indian stye Paneer Dosa at homeFoodThe 8 perfect steps to grow âDhaniyaâ in the kitchen gardenLifestyle10 baby girl names that sound royalLifestyle15 Indian states and their famous state animalstravel10 delicious Indian dishes that can be made with raw bananaFoodHow to make protein-rich Lahori Paneer KormaFood8 fruits and veggies that can help get rid of eye glassesLifestyle10 green vegetables that have highest protein contentLifestyle Next123 Photostories 5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldFrom Bharti Singh- Elvish Yadav getting summoned in Rs 500 crore fraud case to Khushi Mali replacing Palak Sindhwani in Taarak Mehta: Top TV newsOptical illusion psychology test: The first thing you see reveals the hidden flaw affecting your relationshipsSunny Deol's 'Gadar', Shah Rukh Khan's 'Devdas', Rishi Kapoor's 'Chandni': Movies allegedly rejected by GovindaTop 10 richest Indian states in 2024Bigg Boss 18 House: A sneak peek into Salman Khan's show with a Turkish Hammam Bathroom, Prehistoric Jail, and Cave-Inspired Bedroomâ10 most educated countries of the worldâFrom their moving-in together plans to Krishna Mukherjee hinting at the Bigg Boss couple'swedding next year; A look at Jasmine Bhasin and Aly Goni's emotional reunionAnimal Park, Dhoom 4, Ramayana: 5 upcoming blockbuster movies of Ranbir KapoorWhere the zodiac signs would prefer to liveThe Great Indian Kapil Show 2:From high-end car collection to net worth, lavish apartment, farmhouse and more: Luxurious life of Kapil Sharma5 signs you are unknowingly being toxic to yourself, as per psychology123Hot PicksExit Polls 2024 LiveJK Election Exit Polls 2024 LivePatrick MahomesMarshawn LynchDavante AdamsMike FlorioSean CombsTOP TRENDINGWWE Smackdown HighlightsPrince WilliamKing CharlesPrince HarryElon MuskWorld Richest FamilySadhguru QuotesDonald TrumpAmerican Airlines FlightIAF ChiefTrending StoriesIn CityEntire Website"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelceâs time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar facesTech Layoffs and Tough Immigration Rules Impact Indian H-1B Visa Holders: 11 Important Things They Must KnowIsrael Hezbollah War Live Updates: Hamas' armed wing leader Saeed Atallah killed in Israeli strike on north Lebanon10 Sadhguru Quotes to Inspire StudentsJJ Watts believes age will be the sole reason for Travis Kelce's struggles rather than Taylor Swift'Get your f**king hands off of her': Heroic passengers unite to protect woman from assault on flight'People who worked closely with Diddy terrified, losing sleep'Haryana Assembly Election 2024 Live Updates: Dushyant Chautala, Babita Phogat vote as 9.53% voter turnout recorded till 9am'You bear responsibility of ...': Houthis issue warning to shipowners in new phase of escalating Red Sea attacksJammu & Kashmir Exit Poll 2024 Live Updates: Exit polls set to show face-off between BJP and NC; check when and where to watchCongress projected to win Haryana, advantage to NC alliance in J&K, exit polls showIsrael military official says 'preparing response' to Iran attackWhy Indian women need to know more about this contraception methodExit polls predict Congress sweep in Haryana: Top developmentsShivam Dube ruled out of India-Bangladesh T20I seriesTrump goes nuclear for IsraelWill âGaumataâ push help BJP+allies consolidate Hindu votes?Customs at Delhi Airport seize 12 iPhone 16 Pro Max from passengersIn J&K exit polls, Congress-NC alliance closest to majority'Since I am a civil person ...

Flu vaccines available in the market are known to be effective against most strains. RANCHI: A sudden rise in cold, cough and fever cases in different parts of the state has triggered speculations of a subtype H3N2 of influenza A virus being in circulation. Reported to have infected humans for the first time in 1968, the virus, medical experts believe, has undergone several mutations since then and because of its virulence it can be a cause of concern.Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Mukesh Kumar admitted witnessing several fold increase in cases of viral fever in the last ten days."Unless it is established by microbiological testing, we cannot identify the cases to be of influenza, so we are calling them viral fever," he said.A similar spurt in cold, cough, soar throat and fever cases has been seen in private clinics as well. ENT superspecialist Dr Abhishek Kumar Ramadhin has been getting patients with complaints of cold, cough, fever and soar throat in large numbers since the beginning of the month. "H3N2 subtype of influenza A virus is known to be highly infectious and after infecting the upper respiratory track it often affects the lower respiratory track including the lungs, leading to persistent cough and breathlessness. Since we are noticing such symptoms in many patients, we are suspecting the H3N2 subtype of dominating the bulk of infections," he said.Though the Union ministry of health and family welfare is yet to issue any guidelines related to H3N2 virus infection, the integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) has taken some measures, asking the laboratories to be ready for conducting tests.Head of IDSP Jharkhand, Dr Praveen Kumar Karn said the departments of microbiology at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi and Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College in Jamshedpur have been directed to conduct tests for the influenza virus. "Already Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance is being strengthened and suspected clinical samples being tested at Rims and MGM but since last three months no positive case of H1N1 have been reported," he said.Head of Rims microbiology department, Dr Ashok Kumar Sharma said the laboratory is equipped with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing through which DNA and RNA viruses could be detected. "Like testing for novel corona virus, a different kit is required to conduct tests for the influenza viruses," he said.Tests have already been started in private labs, mostly linked with hospitals. Dr Ramadhin who also heads an ENT hospital said the testing of a combination of two A subtypes of influenza virus (H1N1 and H3N2) and one B-type influenza virus is available for 6000-6500 in private laboratories. "Since there is no specific treatment available for viral infections, we are treating patients with cold, cough and fever symptomatically," he said, citing the cost of tests as one big reason for the exact variant of virus not yet identified.Additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said till date there is no advisory issued by the Centre. "As per the information received from the central IDSP, an advisory with SOP is expected in the coming days. This is a type of seasonal influenza with symptoms of common flu," he said.Health experts also advised taking shots of influenza vaccines for the elderly with comorbid conditions.

Advertisment The influenza A subtype H3N2 is causing respiratory issues for many Indians, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Indian Medical Association (IMA). It results in a three to five-day fever and a three to four-week-long cough. Patients are exhibiting all H3N2 symptoms, including fever, coughing, fatigue, headaches, muscular aches, sore throats, and nasal congestion. The IMA has advised physicians to avoid giving patients antibiotics before determining whether the ailment is bacterial because this can lead to resistance. Antibiotics are not necessary for the majority of present cases of fever, cough, sore throat, and body aches, which are caused by influenza. H3N2 Influenza A: Symptoms Symptoms of H3N2 include the following- Fever - Chills - Cough - Nausea - Vomiting - Sore throat - Muscle and body aches - Diarrhoea - Runny nose and sneezing H3N2 Influenza A: Precautions To prevent H3N2 influenza, it is important to take some precautionary measures like- - Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. - Use face masks and stay away from crowded places. - Refrain from touching your lips and nose. - When sneezing and coughing, properly cover your mouth and nose. - Keep hydrated by drinking lots of water. - Take paracetamol if you have a fever and a body ache. Since H3N2 influenza is highly contagious and can spread from person to person rapidly through droplets thus being airborne, here are a few things you should refrain from: - Avoid giving a handshake - Don't spit on the streets. - Do not self-medicate. Only after consulting a doctor should a patient use antibiotics or any other medications. - Try not to consume food when seated next to others. #India #Health news #treatment #states #symptoms #Influenza #H3N2 Virus Outbreak Related Articles Latest Stories Read the Next Article Powered by Subscribe to our Newsletter!

State surveillance officers are therefore fully geared to meet this public health challenge. So far, Karnataka and Haryana have confirmed one death each from H3N2 influenza.New Delhi: Union Health Ministry is keeping a close watch on the Seasonal Influenza situation in various States/UTs through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) network on a real-time basis. The Ministry is also tracking and keeping a close watch on morbidity and mortality due to the H3N2 subtype of seasonal Influenza. Young children and old age persons with co-morbidities are the most vulnerable groups in the context of seasonal influenza. So far, Karnataka and Haryana have confirmed one death each from H3N2 influenza.Also Read:ICMR advises against indiscriminate antibiotic use amid rising cases linked to Influenza subtype A H3N2Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses which circulate in all parts of the world, and the cases are seen to increase during certain months globally. India every year witnesses two peaks of seasonal influenza: one from Jan to March and other in the post-monsoon season. The cases arising from seasonal influenza are expected to decline from March end. State surveillance officers are therefore fully geared to meet this public health challenge.Real-time surveillance through a countrywide network of labsNear real-time surveillance of cases of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) presenting in OPDs and IPDs of health facilities is undertaken by Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).1. According to the latest data available on IDSP-IHIP (integrated health Information Platform), a total of 3038 laboratory-confirmed cases of various subtypes of Influenza including H3N2 have been reported till 9th March 2023 by the States. This includes 1245 cases in January 1307 in February and 486 cases in March (till 9th March).2. Further, the IDSP-IHIP data from health facilities indicate that during the month of January 2023, a total of 397,814 cases of Acute Respiratory Illness/Influenza Like Illness (ARI/ILI) were reported from the country that increased slightly to 436,523 during February, 2023. In the first 9 days of March 2023, this number stands at 133,412 cases.3. The corresponding data for admitted cases of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is 7041 cases in January 2023, 6919 during February 2023 and 1866 during the first 9 days of March 2023.In 2023 (till 28th February), a total of 955 H1N1 cases have been reported. Majority of the H1N1 cases are reported from Tamil Nadu (545), Maharashtra (170), Gujarat (74), Kerala (42) and Punjab (28).Influenza data from ICMR network of laboratoriesIn India, an integrated surveillance of Influenza like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) for the detection of human influenza virus and SARS-COV-2 virus is ongoing through structured ILI/SARI surveillance network of 28 sites. The surveillance network is comprised of 27 DHR-ICMR’s Virus Research & Diagnostic Laboratories and country’s National Influenza Centre (WHO-NIC) housed at ICMR-National Institute of Virology Pune, also a WHO Collaborating Centre for Global Influenza Surveillance & Response System (GISRS).During the period of the first 9 weeks (January 2nd to March 5th) of 2023, the surveillance network has monitored the human influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection in SARI and ILI cases. The influenza typing results are summarized below:WeekWeek 1Week 2Week 3Week 4Week 5Week 6Week 7Week 8Week 9Influenza A H1N1pdm09884653025Influenza A H3N2465744424761465256Influenza B Victoria411641218101313It can be seen that Influenza H3N2 is the predominant sub-type among the samples testing positive for influenza, since the beginning of this year.Public Health MeasuresGuidelines on seasonal Influenza: MOHFW has provided guidelines on categorization of patients, treatment protocol, and guidelines on Ventilatory management to the States/UTs which are also available on the website of the Ministry (www.mohfw.nic.in) and NCDC (ncdc.gov.in). MOHFW has also advised the State Governments for vaccination of health care workers dealing with H1N1 cases.ICMR has also issued an advisory regarding this. Drugs and LogisticsOseltamivir is the drug recommended by WHO. The drug is made available through the Public Health System free of cost. The government has allowed the sale of Oseltamivir under Schedule H1 of Drug and Cosmetic Act in February 2017 for wider accessibility and availability. Adequate logistics are available in the States. However, in case of any emergencies the Govt. of India has been providing the support to the States to tide over the crisis.Additionally, NITI Aayog will hold an inter-ministerial meeting tomorrow, i.e., 11th March 2023 to review the Seasonal Influenza situation in the States and for ways to further support them in terms of public health measures, management guidelines and protocols to manage the increasing Seasonal Influenza cases.Also Read:H3N2 strain overtakes swine flu virus: DAKIndian Council of Medical ResearchH3N2H3N2 InfluenzaInfluenza casesHealth MinistryICMRInfluenza GuidelinesIntegrated Disease Surveillance ProgrammeUnion Health Ministryseasonal influenzaKajal RajputKajal joined Medical Dialogue in 2019 for the Latest Health News.

About half of all inpatients, admitted for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), as well as outpatients being treated for influenza-like illness, are found to have influenza A H3N2, ICMR stated in its dashboard information.This subtype appears to cause more hospitalisation than other influenza subtypes. Of the hospitalised SARI patients with influenza A H3N2, about 92 per cent presented with fever, 86 per cent with cough, 27 per cent with breathlessness, 16 per cent with wheezing. Additionally, 16 per cent had clinical signs of pneumonia and 6 per cent had seizures. 10 per cent of SARI patients who have H3N2, needed oxygen, while 7 per cent required ICU care. The H3N2 has been in wide circulation for the last two to three months the ICMR stated.The ICMR report has said that the resistance to powerful antibiotics has risen by up to 10 percent in a year. Besides, the rise of multidrug-resistant pathogens called Acinetobacter baumannii, attacks the lungs of a patient.Major hospitals in Mumbai are recording 10 to 12 cases of influenza every day and most patients are aged between 25 and 50 years. They have reported symptoms such as high fever, throat pain, cough and cold.In another development, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in a public advisory dated March 03, posted on social media advised people & medical practitioners to avoid prescription of antibiotics to the patients of with seasonal fever, cold & cough.The notice pointed out a sudden rise in the number of patients having symptoms such as cough, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, fever, body ache and even Diarrhoea in some cases. It also advised doctors to give only symptomatic treatment and not to prescribe antibiotics to patients.“The infection usually lasts for about five to seven days. The fever goes away at the end of three days, but the cough can persist for up to three weeks,” IMA stated adding that that it is common to have seasonal cold or cough during October to February period, because of influenza and other viruses.“People start taking antibiotics like azithromycin and amoxiclav etc., that too without caring for dose and frequency and stop it once they start feeling better. This needs to be stopped as it leads to antibiotic resistance. “Whenever there will be a real use of antibiotic, they will not work due to the resistance,” the notice further read.The IMA also listed out the misused antibiotics including amoxicillin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin which were prescribed for diarrhoea and for urinary tract infection (UTI). The IMA advised avoiding crowded places, practising good hand and respiratory hygiene practices as well as flu vaccination.

Telegram Facebook Copy Link PTI Published On Mar 11, 2023 at 07:45 PM IST Read by: 100 Industry Professionals Read by 100 Industry Professionals Ranchi: A central team that took stock of the situation in Jharkhand's capital Ranchi after a bird flu outbreak expressed "satisfaction over the protocol and standard operating procedures followed by the state government" to contain the spread of the disease, an official said on Friday. Ninety-six birds were culled, and 5,320 eggs were destroyed in the epicenter of the outbreak here, State Animal Husbandry Director Chandan Kumar told PTI. The outbreak was reported on March 3 in Ranchi, barely a week after the spread of the bird flu disease in Bokaro district led to the culling of 4,000 chickens and ducks. Advt "The central team took stock of the situation and visited the burial site of the poultry. They expressed satisfaction over the protocol and standard operating procedures followed by the state," Kumar said. He said 4,882 eggs were destroyed at the epicentre on Friday. H5N1, a type of avian influenza virus, was confirmed among poultry near Jail More under the jurisdiction of the Ranchi Municipal Corporation. The Centre, in a letter to Jharkhand Chief Secretary Sukhdev Singh on March 3, confirmed the outbreak of avian influenza (H5N1) in poultry in Ranchi, directing the state government for its control and containment. The letter from the Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying read, "The samples from the said epicentre (Jail More, Ranchi Municipal Corporation) were sent...to the ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal which confirmed on March 3, 2023, that samples are found positive for H5N1 avian influenza". The state government has been asked to take immediate measures, including the declaration of infected and surveillance areas, restricting access to infected premises and culling of birds. Officials had instructed the culling of birds by declaring areas within the 1-km radius of the epicentre as the 'affected' zones. Advt An area within a 10-km radius would be declared as a 'surveillance' zone. In February, 3,856 birds were culled in Bokaro district after the confirmation of a bird flu outbreak among 'Kadaknath' chicken, a variety of the protein-rich breed. Symptoms of the infection among humans include severe upper back pain, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and blood in sputum, officials said. The state Animal Husbandry Department has issued an advisory, urging people to inform it if they see dead birds.

Amid the recovery process, a new virus, named H3N2, has prompted authorities to raise an alarm over its spread. Since the past few months, cases of cold and cough across the country including Delhi-NCR are rising. Several cases of the H3N2 virus have also been reported from some parts of the country including Karnataka and Haryana. A death has also been reported due to the H3N2 virus in Karnataka's Hassan where an 82-year-old man died due to influenza on March 1. Health experts have warned that this H3N2 virus could severely affect children, the elderly and people who have some sort of illness. Experts have advised using a face mask to prevent the spread of the H3N2 virus. To get more information about the H3N2 Virus, Jagran Prime spoke to many big doctors and researchers of the country including Dr Randeep Guleria, former director of AIIMS, Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh, National President of Indian Medical Association, Dr Raj Kumar, Director of Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, Dr Narendra Saini, Chairman, Scientific Committee, Delhi Medical Association and Professor Rupesh Chaturvedi, Department of Biotechnology, JNU. What is H3N2? H3N2 is a non-human influenza virus. It usually spreads in pigs and has reached humans from them. The most commonly circulating viruses in pigs are called "swine influenza virus". When these viruses infect humans, they are called "variant" viruses. A specific H3N2 virus was detected in 2011 with avian, swine, and H1N1 pandemic viruses. The virus was circulating in pigs since 2010 and was first detected in humans in the US in 2011. Where did the H3N2 virus come from? H3N2 is a variant of the influenza virus itself. Originally it came from pigs. An (H1N1) virus caused a terrible pandemic in 1918. Lakhs of people had lost their lives due to this. The circulating strain of that virus is now H3N2. What are the symptoms of H3N2 virus infection? Symptoms of H3N2 infection are similar to those of the seasonal flu virus and may include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough, runny nose, body aches, nausea, vomiting, or sometimes diarrhoea. In many cases, severe chills, high fever, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, and muscle and body aches are also reported. Why the concern about H3N2? The H3N2 virus can sometimes cause severe illness even in healthy people. The progression of this infection can lead to pneumonia. This can worsen and you may need to be admitted to the hospital. Sometimes death can also result from this infection. Who is most vulnerable to the H3N2 Virus? According to experts, it is most dangerous for children, the elderly and those who already have a disease. A study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that children born after 2001 (age 9 years in 2010) have little or no immunity against the H3N2 virus. In such a situation, their difficulties may increase. However, experts believe that the situation is different in India. In how many days does the fever go down after the H3N2 virus infection? According to the IMA, the symptoms of infection with this virus can persist for five to seven days. The fever caused by H3N2 subsides in three days. But the cough persists for more than three weeks. How is H3N2 influenza virus infection diagnosed? It is difficult to detect the infection of this virus by seeing some symptoms. Blood samples and some other tests are done in the lab to detect this virus. It is only from these tests that it is known whether an H3N2 infection has occurred or there is some other disease. When does the patient need to be taken to the hospital after infection? In most of cases, the patient recovers by taking medicines for normal fever and symptoms. But if there is a problem in breathing, and the oxygen level is low, then it becomes necessary to take the patient to the hospital. If you eat antibiotics without a doctor's advice, then the risk is high. In some cases, it can also become fatal. How to prevent H3N2 influenza virus infection? According to doctors, to avoid this virus, you should wash your hands regularly with soap. Keep sanitiser with you and use it. Avoid coming in contact with a person who is ill. If you are sneezing or coughing, cover your mouth as viral infections spread quickly. Avoid touching eyes and face repeatedly. If you are going to a crowded place then do wear a mask. Is H3N2 dangerous? Currently, H3N2 infection is similar to seasonal flu. Be aware that seasonal influenza can also be a serious illness. Sometimes seasonal influenza can cause complications (such as pneumonia). This can lead to hospitalization and even death. Is there a vaccine for H3N2? Initial steps have been taken to create a vaccine against H3N2. Experts believe that if you have been vaccinated against any variant of the influenza virus, you will get some immunity. Will this season's flu vaccine protect me from H3N2? The seasonal flu vaccine will not protect against H3N2. Seasonal flu vaccines protect against the seasonal influenza virus. The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that every person should get the seasonal flu vaccine every year. Taking this vaccine will provide some relief during the H3N2 infection. In which season H3N2 virus spreads the most? It is common to have a seasonal cold or cough during the period from October to February due to influenza and other viruses. H3N2 virus infection also increases during this period. Which age group need to be more careful? According to the advisory issued by the IMA, it mostly occurs in people above 50 years of age and below 15 years of age. In such a situation, these people need to be more careful. Does air pollution also have a role in increasing H3N2 virus infection? H3N2 virus infection directly affects your breathing system. It affects the upper respiratory system. When air pollution is high, the chances of getting an infection in the upper respiratory system increase.More In NewsHyderabad: Public Gatherings, Protests Banned Within 500m Of State Secretariat Following Security ConcernsTelanganaKarnataka Minister Zameer Ahmed Khan Sparks Row With Racist Slur Against Union Minister KumaraswamyIndiaForeign Secretary Vikram Misri Gets Two-Year Tenure Extension, To Serve Till 2026IndiaMumbai Sees Rise In Hand-Foot-Mouth Disease Cases Among Children; Check Symptoms And PreventionMaharashtraAndhra Pradesh Rain: Visakhapatnam, Nellore And Ten Other Districts On Heavy Rain Alert Till Nov 14 | DetailsIndiaNext ArticleJagran HindiPunjabi JagranGujarati JagranNai DuniaInextliveJagran Josh Only My HealthHer ZindagiVishvas NewsJagran TVJagran English brings you all the latest and breaking news from India and around the world.

To create awareness and suggest precautions regarding the same, Create Stories Social Welfare Society organised a special seminar on web with expert Dr. Abhyudaya Verma. The consulting physician and endocrinologist explained various aspects of H3N2 Influenza virus and gave preventive care tips.Dr Verma said, "The sudden spurt in the cases of Influenza (H3N2) virus in the country has raised the concern, thousands of cases of Influenza are being reported daily in the country for some time." He added that H3N4 is called Influenza A virus, it is a viral respiratory infection."When infected, the patient suffers from cold, flu, fever lasts for three to five days or more and along with it comes continuous cough which can last for three weeks," Dr Verma said.He added that influenza spreads like covid-19 as it is also a communicable virus."Since this virus spreads from one to another, special care needs to be taken in festivals and other events," Dr Verma said.He added that common symptoms include cold and mild fever."Patients of Diabetes, BP, Heart, Asthma, Dialysis etc should be careful, there is a high risk of harm from H3N2 Influenza, just like they followed the protocol in Covid, follow this protocol for the next few months," Dr Verma advised.He suggested wearing a mask, regularly washing hands and maintaing distance. "Vaccination for influenza is also available, but basic preventive care is must as treatment for those with other issues is more of a concern," Dr Verma said. He also suggested opting for warm water and avoiding cold drinks.ICMR and the Indian Medical Association had also issued an advisory saying that patients should not self-medicate if they have symptoms, but take medicines or get treated after showing them to a doctor. Do not use antibiotics or any other medicine at all without asking the doctor. If antibiotics are eaten without doctor's advice, then the risk is high. In some cases it can also become fatal.To avoid H3N2 virus, suggestions by Dr Verma- Wash your hands regularly.- Carry a sanitizer always.- Avoid coming in contact with a person who is ill.- If you are sneezing or coughing, cover your mouth as viral infections spread quickly.- Avoid touching eyes and face repeatedly, wash hands thoroughly before touching.- If you are going to a crowded place, do wear a mask.

In India, there have been about 90 cases of the H3N2 virus and eight cases of the H1N1 virus. The number of flu cases has been increasing in the nation over the past few months, and many are worried since the symptoms are identical to those of Covid-19. In India, the H3N2 virus sometimes referred to as the “Hong Kong flu,” is the influenza subtype that leads to the most hospitalizations. The H3N2 and H1N1 viruses can cause a variety of symptoms that can last up to a week, including a persistent cough, fever, chills, dyspnea, and wheezing as well as nausea, sore throats, body pains, and diarrhea. Coughing, sneezing, and close contact with an infected individual are the main ways that the virus is transmitted and is very contagious. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has advised implementing precautions similar to those advised by Covid, including frequent handwashing, wearing a mask while coughing and sneezing, avoiding touching the eyes and nose, drinking enough fluids, and taking paracetamol for fever and body pains. For high-risk groups, including older adults, younger children, and persons with compromised immune systems as a result of ongoing medical conditions, the infection can be severe, according to doctors. In light of the potential development of antibiotic resistance, the Indian Medical Association recently advised physicians against prescribing antibiotics to patients before determining whether the infection is bacterial.

By Shruti Niraj H3N2 Virus: All You Need To Know! The flu season is here and this time the H3N2 Virus is sparking fears for many. H3N2 VIRUS It's a sub-type of the Influenza A virus that is spreading rapidly across the country. FEAR OF NEW VIRUS As India reported its first death due to the H3N2 Virus in Haryana, another case was recorded in Karnataka, let's take a look at the symptoms, treatment and dos and don't to stay safe. H3N2 IN INDIA H3N2's flu symptoms are body aches, pains, fever, chills, fatigue, diarrhoea, vomiting, cough, sore throat, runny nose and headache. SYMPTOMS This virus is extremely contagious and spreads through droplets released by an infected person when coughing, sneezing, or talking. HOW IT SPREADS? As per the reports, pregnant women, children, elderly people, and persons with underlying medical issues are at high risk of catching this virus. WHO ARE AT MOST RISK? Keep checking the oxygen level if you feel uneasy and make sure that the oxygen saturation level is not less than 95 per cent. PRECAUTIONS If the oxygen level drops below 95 per cent, you must rush to a doctor and avoid self-medication. Many people who contract the seasonal flu are able to recuperate at home without any medical assistance. TREATMENTS You can increase your water intake and drink lots of fluid. However, if the symptoms continue to accelerate, consult a doctor, immediately. The symptoms of H3N2 and coronavirus are somewhat the same as they are both caused by contagious viruses. However... H3N2 VS COVID-19 they both belong to different families of viruses. While COVID-19 is caused by the SARs-CoV-2 virus, H3N2 is a sub-type of the Influenza A virus. Also, the incubation period for the H3N2 virus may be much shorter than that of COVID-19. To avoid getting infected with the H3N2 virus, wash your hands regularly with soap and water. DOS AND DON'TS Must wear a mask in crowded places and avoid touching your nose and mouth. Cover your nose and mouth while sneezing and coughing.

All Rights Reserved Bird Flu Explained: Everything You Need To Know News Experts Health Nutrition Fitness Relationships Features Advertise Health » Health Conditions Bird Flu Explained: Everything You Need To Know Alya Inside/Shutterstock By Becki RobinsUpdated: March 10, 2023 3:09 pm EST It's the spring of 2022, and the masks are finally coming off. At last, there's a light at the end of the pandemic tunnel, and right there in that beam of sunshine you can see ... bird flu. That's right, everyone, a new virus has moved in to take the place of the old. Or more accurately, it's moved in alongside the old, because COVID's not going away anytime soon. Now, if you were paying attention back in 2005, you probably know a little bit about bird flu, also known as "avian influenza." It's the very scary virus that bounced around Asia for a year or two, infecting humans and birds alike, but fortunately failed to become the COVID-style pandemic scientists feared it would become. Now it's happening all over again — only this time, the virus is spreading farther and faster. Thankfully, though, this virus is different from the one that terrified the world back in the mid-2000s. Here's what you need to know about the 2022 strain of avian influenza. Avian flu is spreading from east to west Haboco/Shutterstock This particular strain of avian influenza was first detected in eastern Canada in late November of 2021 (via the Toronto Star). Patient Zero was a great black-backed gull that was found at a pond in the city of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. Just one month later, the virus killed 360 birds at a petting farm on the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland. By January, the virus was in the United States. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the first known cases appeared in wild birds harvested by hunters in the Carolinas, but by early February, it had also been found in Virginia, Florida, and Maryland. In just the few months since, it's been relentlessly marching across America, infecting wild and domestic birds in 32 states (via the CDC). Avian flu can now be found as far west as Idaho. In the United States alone, there have been 283 outbreaks in 159 counties (as of May 5, 2022). This virus is highly pathogenic Africa Studio/Shutterstock Like influenza strains that infect human beings, avian flu isn't just a single virus (via the Food and Agriculture Organization). There are multiple strains, and each is placed into one of two categories: highly pathogenic (HPAI) and low pathogenic (LPAI). The H5N1 virus that's circulating in the United States right now is in the HPAI category. That sounds bad, but pathogenesis in this case is defined by how virulent the virus is in poultry, which doesn't necessarily mean it's also virulent in people. An HPAI virus can wipe out entire flocks, while an LPAI virus is one that could potentially infect poultry but doesn't really make them sick. Avian influenza is spread via pretty much everything that comes out of a bird: saliva, secretions from the nose and eyes, and feces. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) even warns against eating eggs with runny yolks, though they've kind of always warned against that. According to the Mayo Clinic, you could in theory contract bird flu from eating undercooked eggs, though it's unlikely that eggs from infected birds would ever make it into the food supply (via the USDA). Avian flu is mostly spread by aquatic birds Sim One/Shutterstock Here's some good news: For the average city-dweller, bird flu is unlikely to ever pose a serious threat, as long as it doesn't mutate into a form that can easily spread from person to person. According to the CDC, the primary vectors of this virus are aquatic birds, which includes species like ducks, geese, gulls, terns, and the like. Even if you spend a lot of time on the beach, you're unlikely to come close enough to one of these birds that it will be possible to contract avian flu from one, unless a gull happens to steal your french fries or poop on your head. (On second thought, maybe you should stay away from the beach.) The CDC also notes that most birds that carry avian flu are asymptomatic, which means they can happily fly around from pond to pond spreading the virus, so it's a very good idea to avoid feeding ducks and other aquatic birds. Health authorities in some states have even asked people to stop putting out feeders for local songbirds (via the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development) in order to help prevent the spread of the virus. Avian flu has been found in 51 different bird species Soccrates Images/Getty Images The potential for transmission to humans is scary, but avian influenza is exactly what its name implies: a virus that infects birds. Health officials are mostly concerned about the latest outbreak because of its potential to devastate the poultry industry and infect already declining populations of migratory birds. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), avian influenza has been detected in 51 different American bird species so far. And it's not just ducks and gulls, either. Affected species range from raptors all the way down to songbirds, though to be fair, it's so far only been found in a couple of different kinds of songbirds. Some of the virus's known victims include at least 200 black vultures in a Florida state park and 48 bald eagles (via Science). The USGS also notes the deaths of peregrine falcons, great horned owls, and red-tailed hawks. Raptors often prey on waterfowl, which is probably how they contracted the virus. Zoos are isolating their birds in an effort to protect them Myroslava Bozhko/Shutterstock Zoos have a lot of wildlife species that could be considered rare or exotic. Many zoos even have breeding programs for threatened and endangered species. Generally speaking, every animal housed in a zoo represents a significant investment in time and money, so zoos have a particular interest in making sure that their animals stay safe and healthy. This HPAI outbreak has so far affected twice as many different bird species as the last one (via Science), which means no one can really be sure which species are the most vulnerable to infection and death. According to the Associated Press, zoos aren't taking any chances — they're bringing their birds indoors and isolating them from people and other birds. This means visitors aren't going to see as many feathered species as they would have a few years ago, but the alternative is much, much worse than a drop in visitation. An outbreak inside a zoo would almost certainly mean the zoo would have to cull every avian species on display, endangered or otherwise. That makes it a scary time to be a zookeeper. There is a reassortant version that includes genes from North American bird flu Kudryashova Vera/Shutterstock Some viruses, like measles, never really change. That's why you can get a measles vaccine in childhood and be protected for the rest of your life. Flu viruses, though, are different. They're constantly mutating, which is why scientists still haven't been able to come up with an all-in-one vaccine that can protect you from every strain. Viruses can also reassort, which means they can obtain genes from other viruses and use them to become a brand new virus. It's possible, for example, that reassortment between a human virus and an avian virus might produce a virus that would be better at infecting humans (via Nature). Avian flu reassortants have already been found here in the United States. According to the USDA, the EA/AM strain of H5N1 is a reassortant of a Eurasian strain and a North American strain. This means that at some point, both viruses probably infected a single host and then had a gene-swapping party (via Emerging Infectious Diseases). So far, reassortant avian flu viruses don't seem to be especially virulent, but the right gene combination could potentially create a new virus with pandemic potential. It's mostly impacting domestic poultry Photoarte/Shutterstock No one wants to see bald eagles or already declining migratory species dying from avian influenza, but deaths in wild birds have, at least so far, been fairly limited. Most of the known infections have occurred in domestic poultry, especially chickens and birds. This includes backyard flocks, not just major chicken producers. According to the USDA, the first poultry farm outbreak of this particular bird pandemic happened at an Indiana turkey farm in February of 2022. Shortly afterwards, the virus was found in poultry farms in three states, including a backyard flock. Since then, avian influenza has gone on to infect chickens and turkeys all over the eastern to midwestern United States, and it's not just in commercial farms but in backyard chicken coops, too. And when domestic poultry come down with the flu, it's not like you can just keep them comfortable and give them a bowl of chicken soup or something — even one case of avian influenza typically means the entire flock has to be destroyed. So far, 23 million chickens and turkeys have been destroyed in an effort to limit the spread of the virus (via AP News). The virus is also impacting the food supply Lin Xiu Xiu/Shutterstock Because what we all really needed right now was for prices to be higher, all of this is making prices higher. Consumers who were buying more chicken to make up for not being able to afford beef are now finding themselves equally unable to afford chicken. According to NPR, in late March of 2022, the average U.S. price per pound for chicken breasts rocketed up to $3.63 a pound, or 62 cents more per pound than it had been just a week earlier. That price was already 59 cents per pound higher than it had been in March of 2021. If you've been thinking about going vegan, now might be the right time to do that. The price of eggs is going way up, too. Per the Washington Post, consumers now pay an average of $2.95 per dozen, compared to $1 per dozen as recently as November of 2021. Most people at risk are those who work with poultry Dejan Dundjerski/Shutterstock The big question is: just how big is the risk to people? Well, the good news is, not very. At least not so far. According to the CDC, avian influenza poses a very low risk to human beings. Most avian influenza strains don't infect people at all, and the ones that do infect people do so only rarely. Notably, the strains that have been known to cause human disease are the Asian H7N9 and the Asian H5N1. When bird flu does infect people, it's usually people who work in poultry farms or have close contact with infected birds, such as people involved in disease control and eradication, animal welfare workers, and wildlife biologists (via the CDC). In fact, the CDC says infection probably happens mostly after prolonged, unprotected exposure to infected birds or a contaminated environment, so the people most at risk are those who are inhaling or otherwise contacting a lot of virus. This means it's less likely to be a threat to the average backyard chicken owner, even if the virus does infect that person's flock. The risk of getting it from another person is very low Orion Production/Shutterstock It's not really super likely that you'll get bird flu from your pet chicken or the bluebird that visits your feeder every morning, but it's even less likely you'll get it from your crazy neighbor who keeps 150 chickens in her barn. Examples of human-to-human transmission of avian influenza are even less common than examples of bird-to-human transmission. The few times it has happened, it has not resulted in epidemic spread of the virus. According to the CDC, in 2003, two poultry workers may have spread H7N7 to three family members. The operative word here is "may" — it really just means they had suspicious symptoms, not that the cases were confirmed. Similarly, in 2004, a sick child probably passed H5N1 along to her mother and aunt, and in 2007, a father may have contracted H5N1 from his son. There have been a few similar cases over the years, but most involve very close contact between family members. In short, this means that even though the virus can potentially pass from person to person, it's just not that contagious in humans. It's not the same as the 2005 strain China Photos/Getty Images The thing that's really freaking everyone out right now is the fact that in the very recent past, avian flu has been known to be deadly in humans. In Indonesia, for example, the 2005 strain of H5N1 had a case-fatality rate of 76% (via the Journal of Infectious Diseases). That means more than three-quarters of everyone who contracted avian flu during that outbreak died from the disease. Compare that to COVID-19, which has a global case fatality rate of 2 to 3 percent (via the British Medical Journal) and still managed to terrify the entire world, and ... well, it's not really something you'd want to spend too much time thinking about. According to the CDC, though, this particular H5N1 is different. The currently circulating virus is the predominant subtype pretty much everywhere in the world, and it doesn't have the same changes that made earlier H5N1 viruses so deadly to people. The CDC also notes that it's hard to say just how this particular H5N1 strain will affect humans, because so far, there haven't been enough infections to provide a decent picture of what human disease might look like. The first human case was in the UK GlassQuail/Shutterstock During this outbreak, there have, in fact, been only two confirmed cases in people (so far). According to the World Health Organization, the first laboratory confirmed case was in the United Kingdom. The case involved a 79-year-old man who kept 20 ducks inside his house and had another 100 ducks living on his property (via the Guardian). The ducks developed symptoms of avian influenza on the 18th of December, 2021; less than a week later, nasal swabs confirmed that the ducks' owner had the disease, too. This is only one case, so it's impossible to use it to draw any conclusions about how dangerous the virus is. Still, it's worth noting that the man did not have any symptoms of avian influenza, and he did not pass it on to anyone else. Genetic sequencing determined that the virus was HPAI H5N1, but that it didn't have any mutations that might make it more transmissible among humans — making this a simple case of transmission via prolonged, unprotected exposure, just like the CDC said. So far, there has only been one human case in the U.S. Torychemistry/Shutterstock The virus has also been found in an American human, but again, this person had prolonged contact with infected birds, so the case isn't especially surprising or alarming. The patient was a prisoner in Colorado who the Independent described as "aged under 40." He was enrolled in a work-release program at a poultry farm, and according to the CDC, was not only working in buildings that contained sick poultry, but was also involved in actively culling animals that were believed to be infected. This case was also laboratory-confirmed, so there's no doubt he was infected, but like the U.K. case, the infection was not severe. The patient did report some fatigue for a few days, but even so, fatigue can just as easily be job-related as virus-related. So far, that's two for two mild cases resulting from prolonged exposure. Again, that doesn't necessarily mean this virus isn't going to be a problem for people, but it's a very good sign. In humans, the symptoms are similar to other flus Simona Pilolla 2/Shutterstock We don't really know what the symptoms of the dominant H5N1 flu strain might be in people, because so far, the two known human infections didn't really produce symptoms. In past H5N1 strains, however, symptoms have been similar to the symptoms of any influenza. According to the CDC, this includes things like fever, headache, muscle pain, fatigue, cough, runny nose, and sore throat. In more severe cases, people might have shortness of breath or seizures. Some gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and vomiting have also occurred. With the more dangerous strains, patients often develop pneumonia and require hospitalization. One symptom that isn't usually seen in other types of influenza is conjunctivitis, colloquially known as pink-eye. This symptom occurred in a couple of suspected cases from the early 2000s (via the CDC). That said, it's worth noting that so far, human cases of this strain have been more or less asymptomatic. Birds have different symptoms Julia Zavalishina/Shutterstock If you're one of the growing number of people who keep backyard chickens, you're much more likely to see this disease in your flock than you are in yourself or others. It's important to know what avian flu looks like in chickens, because you'll need to be able to identify it if it comes to your neighborhood. According to the University of Minnesota, avian influenza infects chickens and turkeys, but may also be seen in other domestic birds such as ducks, geese, pheasants, and quail. The disease looks different in birds than it does in people — chickens might gasp for air and have severe diarrhea. They may also have discolored heads and feet, as well as swelling of the eyes, head, and neck. Turkeys could have tremors, paralysis of the wings, and other nervous system problems. Sometimes, the first and only symptom is sudden death. That sounds scary if you're especially fond of your birds, but in this case, sudden death is actually a mercy. Animals that experience symptoms are doomed either way, and so are those that don't, because the standard procedure is to cull entire flocks in order to prevent further spread of the virus. Avian flu is reportable Bloomberg/Getty Images If you suspect avian flu is spreading through your backyard flock, you have to inform the local health authorities. This isn't even a question of "Should I inform health authorities?" — according to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), avian flu is reportable, which means if you suspect it is circulating in your flock, you are required to tell the USDA and state authorities. This means either health authorities will come to your property to collect samples, or you'll be asked to collect samples yourself. The AVMA is kind of vague on what might happen to your birds if H5N1 is confirmed. In fact, it even implies that you might be able to quarantine and save "companion animals," though it notably doesn't actually say if you can count your pet chickens as "companion animals." Other sources like the USDA, however, make it clear that "depopulation" is the standard response, so it might be a good idea to not get your hopes up. You can protect your flock Chicago Photographer/Shutterstock Bird flu is lethal to poultry and spreading fast, but it is not inevitabile. If you have chickens, you can take steps to protect them. First, make sure to stay informed. Check your local health authority's website daily. If there's an outbreak near you, move your birds indoors (if possible) or keep free-range birds cooped. According to the University of Minnesota, protective measures include storing animal feed indoors and feeding in areas that aren't accessible to wild birds. Make sure to regularly clean and disinfect pens, and avoid sharing chicken handling equipment with poultry-owning neighbors. More importantly, make sure you isolate any new birds for 30 days before introducing them to your flock. And remember that you can bring avian flu onto your property via your shoes, clothes, or vehicle, so if you've been somewhere with a high potential for contamination, keep those things away from your birds until they've been properly disinfected. Fortunately, Science says the spread is likely to slow as migratory birds reach their summer destinations, but be prepared for another outbreak in the fall when migrations begin again. Like COVID, avian flu is likely to be with us for the long term. Recommended
