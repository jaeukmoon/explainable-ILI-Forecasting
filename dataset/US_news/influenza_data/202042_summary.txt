- Seasonal influenza epidemics affect 5-15% of the world's population, resulting in serious cases and deaths.
- Influenza can trigger adverse cardiovascular events, so vaccination is recommended for individuals with chronic heart diseases for secondary prevention.
- The coverage rate of influenza vaccine in individuals with chronic heart disease is underestimated.
- In a study conducted in Italy, the levels of influenza vaccine uptake in individuals with chronic heart disease were unstable, ranging from 42.2% to 50.3%.
- Coverage rates increased with age but did not achieve the target of 75% in individuals over 65 years old.
- Influenza coverage rates were influenced by age, district of residence, category of chronic heart disease, and length of exemption, but not by gender.
- Collaboration between healthcare professionals, scientific societies, and patient associations can support influenza vaccine uptake in individuals with chronic heart diseases.
