Effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine varies by season and circulating virus type. What is added by this report? The 2023 Southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine reduced the risk for influenza-associated hospitalizations by 52%. Circulating influenza viruses were genetically similar to those targeted by the 2023–24 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation. This vaccine might offer similar protection if these viruses predominate during the coming Northern Hemisphere influenza season. What are the implications for public health practice? Vaccination remains one of the most effective ways to protect against influenza-associated complications. In anticipation of Northern Hemisphere influenza virus circulation, CDC recommends that health authorities encourage U.S. health care providers to administer seasonal influenza vaccine to all eligible persons aged ≥6 months.

Since 2013, multiple countries have participated in the Network for the Evaluation of Vaccine Effectiveness in Latin America and the Caribbean–influenza (la Red para la Evaluación de Vacunas en Latino América y el Caribe—influenza [REVELAC–i]) to estimate and monitor vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing severe acute respiratory infection (SARI)–associated hospitalization. Based on data contributed by Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay on 2,780 SARI patients hospitalized during March 27–July 9, 2023, the adjusted VE against SARI hospitalization associated with any influenza virus during the 2023 Southern Hemisphere season was 51.9% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 39.2%–62.0%), including 55.2% (95% CI: 41.8%–65.5%) against the predominating A(H1N1)pdm09. These early, interim estimates, provided before the expected end of seasonal influenza virus circulation, suggest that vaccination substantially reduced the risk for severe influenza illnesses, underscoring the benefits of influenza vaccination. In anticipation of Northern Hemisphere influenza virus circulation, the World Health Organization and CDC recommend that health authorities encourage health care providers to administer annual influenza vaccination to all eligible persons, particularly emphasizing the importance of vaccination for persons at increased risk for severe outcomes (e.g., very young children, persons with preexisting health conditions [including pregnant women], and older adults). Top Introduction In Latin American and Caribbean countries, influenza viruses have been associated with 716,000–829,000 respiratory hospitalizations and 41,007–71,710 deaths each year (1). Despite a history of high influenza vaccination coverage in the region, declines in coverage since 2019 have been observed. Systematic monitoring of influenza and COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE), as is conducted through the Pan American Health Organization’s Network for the Evaluation of Vaccine Effectiveness in Latin America and the Caribbean–influenza (la Red para la Evaluación de Vacunas en Latino América y el Caribe—influenza [REVELAC–i])† can be helpful in supporting public messaging to improve vaccination coverage (2). In addition, VE estimates from countries in the Southern Hemisphere during the March–September influenza season can provide insight into the effectiveness of vaccines for use during the subsequent October–May Northern Hemisphere influenza season (3). Top Methods VE against influenza-associated hospitalization was estimated using a test-negative case-control study design to compare the odds of vaccination between hospitalized patients with a positive influenza test result (test-positive patients [case-patients]) and influenza test-negative hospitalized control patients. Patients meeting criteria for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), defined as acute respiratory infection with a history of fever or documented temperature of ≥100.4°F [≥38°C] and cough, with onset during the preceding 10 days resulting in hospitalization, were identified through sentinel SARI surveillance using a standardized protocol (4). Respiratory specimens were collected and tested for influenza virus type and subtype by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in national reference laboratories. During March 27–July 9, 2023, midseason data were available and were pooled from 486 sentinel hospitals, including 11 in Argentina, 455 in Brazil, eight in Chile, two in Paraguay, and 10 in Uruguay. Because influenza was circulating in the Southern Hemisphere earlier than usual and before the start of influenza vaccination campaigns, the VE evaluation began 2 weeks after each country’s annual national influenza vaccination campaign.§ Participating countries used a Southern Hemisphere formulation of egg-based influenza vaccines; the egg-based trivalent formulation contained antigens from an A/Sydney/5/2021 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)–like virus, and B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)–like virus, with the egg-based quadrivalent formulation also containing B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)–like virus (5). The evaluation population was restricted to SARI patients in three mutually exclusive target groups for vaccination based on national immunization policies. The criteria for each group varied slightly by country, but included 1) young children, 2) persons with preexisting conditions, and 3) older adults.¶ Case-patients were defined as SARI patients with a positive RT-PCR influenza test result. Control patients were defined as SARI patients with negative RT-PCR test results for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Patient vaccination status was ascertained via linkage to national electronic immunization records using unique patient identifiers. Patients who received ≥1 dose of the 2023 season influenza vaccine ≥14 days before symptom onset were considered vaccinated; those who did not receive any influenza vaccine during the 2023 season before symptom onset were considered unvaccinated. Patients vaccinated <14 days before symptom onset or who had positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results were excluded from the evaluation to avoid the risk for confounding (6). VE was estimated using mixed effects logistic models adjusting for age in years (fit as cubic spline), week of symptom onset (fit as cubic spline), and presence of at least one preexisting condition, and accounting for country as a random effect. Analyses were stratified by influenza type and subtype (when available) and presented when data were sufficient (at least five patients contributing to all strata) or when the 95% CI of the VE estimate was <140%. P-values <0.05 and 95% CIs that did not include zero were considered statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.** Top Results During March 27–July 9, 2023, a total of 3,974 SARI hospitalizations among persons prioritized to receive influenza vaccination in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay were identified. Among these, 1,194 were excluded due to a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (405), influenza test result missing (278), vaccinated <14 days before symptom onset (163), receipt of the 2022 influenza vaccine <120 days before 2023 vaccine availability (164), respiratory specimen collected >10 days after symptom onset (82), missing vaccine or demographic information (83), or a duplicated report (19). After these exclusions, 2,780 SARI patients remained in the final analytic sample for the three vaccination target groups, including 1,262 (45.4%) young children, 388 (14.0%) persons with preexisting conditions, and 1,130 (40.6%) older adults (Table 1). Overall, 88 (3.2%) SARI patients were from Argentina, 918 (33.0%) from Brazil, 1,158 (41.7%) from Chile, 167 (6.0%) from Paraguay, and 449 (16.1%) from Uruguay. Influenza viruses were detected among 900 (32.4%) SARI patients, including 815 (90.6%) influenza type A and 85 (9.4%) type B viruses, with a higher percentage of specimens testing positive during earlier surveillance weeks than during the average 2011–2019 circulation (Figure). Among 673 (82.6%) of the 815 influenza A viruses that were subtyped, 668 (99.3%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 and five (0.07%) were A(H3N2); all 85 B lineages were B/Victoria. Influenza detections varied by target group: nearly one half (547; 48.4%) were detected in older adults with SARI, approximately one third (139; 35.8%) in persons with preexisting conditions, and 214 (17.0%) in young children (p-value <0.001). Overall, 23.9% of SARI patients were vaccinated. Although this proportion did not vary by target group, significant differences in vaccination prevalence were observed among SARI patients by country, ranging from 9.4% in Uruguay to 37.0% in Chile. Among SARI patients, 15.3% of case-patients had received a 2023 seasonal influenza vaccine, compared with 28.0% of control patients (Table 2). Overall adjusted VE against influenza-associated SARI hospitalization was 51.9%. VE among young children was 70.2%, and among older adults was 37.6% When limited to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, which predominated during the 2023 Southern Hemisphere season, VE against SARI hospitalization was 55.2%, similar to overall estimates and consistent among target populations. Estimated VE for influenza B (Victoria) was not statistically significant (95% CI included zero) (Table 2), and insufficient numbers of vaccinated case-patients with influenza A(H3N2) precluded estimation of virus-specific VE. As of August 15, 2023, a total of 1,031 influenza viruses had been genetically characterized by CDC, and the five countries’ laboratories reported the isolates to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data.†† The majority of viruses were characterized as belonging to the same genetic clades as the 2023 Southern Hemisphere vaccine components: among 570 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 309 (54.2%) belonged to subclade 5a.2a.1, 259 (45.4%) to subclade 5a.2a, and two (0.4%) to subclade 5a.1. Among six A(H3N2) viruses, three belonged to clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2 subclade 2a.1b and three to subclade 2b. All B/Victoria viruses belonged to subclade V1A.3a.2. Top Discussion This interim evaluation of the 2023 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation was conducted using data from five Southern Hemisphere countries and suggests that the current season’s trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines are effective in reducing influenza-associated hospitalization. In particular, interim VE estimates indicate a significant reduction in hospitalization associated with the predominant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus among young children and older adults. Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent influenza and severe associated outcomes. Health authorities worldwide should encourage influenza vaccination for persons at increased risk for severe disease, including young children, persons with preexisting health conditions, and older adults, as well as those at increased risk for exposure to or transmission of influenza virus, such as health care personnel (3,7). Despite the encouraging influenza VE, fewer than 30% of persons identified through REVELAC–i were vaccinated against influenza before their illness onset. The current findings were consistent with an interim report from Peru, where unadjusted VE against RT-PCR–confirmed influenza illness was 62%, but only one in five persons with medically attended respiratory illness had sought vaccination during 2023 (8), which is lower than the historical norm (2). Evaluations of influenza illness and vaccine knowledge, attitudes, and practices and deployment of World Health Organization (WHO) influenza post-introduction evaluations might help health authorities understand the reasons for reduced vaccination coverage since the COVID-19 pandemic and optimize influenza vaccination coverage in the future.§§ Although the timing and intensity of influenza epidemics in one hemisphere are not necessarily predictive of subsequent epidemics in the opposite hemisphere, this report might help health officials in Northern Hemisphere jurisdictions prepare for a potentially early influenza season and highlight the benefits of vaccination. In recent weeks, most influenza detections in the United States have identified A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses (9). This is a similar pattern to that identified among the evaluated Southern Hemisphere countries, providing an encouraging outlook for vaccine protection from current influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B/Victoria, because the Northern Hemisphere vaccine formulation contains antigenically similar A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09–like virus for egg-based vaccines and A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09–like virus for cell-based vaccines. Nevertheless, whether influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 will remain the predominant virus in the United States during the October 2023–May 2024 Northern Hemisphere influenza season is unclear. In advance of the WHO Vaccine Composition Meeting in September 2023, these data suggest that the influenza A/Sydney/5/2021 (H1N1)pdm09–like and B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage) viruses in the Southern Hemisphere vaccine formulation confer protection against influenza hospitalization; however, for the A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)–like virus, VE estimates from other countries in the Southern Hemisphere, such as South Africa, which has a more substantial influenza A(H3N2) cocirculation, will be needed (10). Influenza B/Yamagata lineage has not circulated globally since 2020, and ongoing monitoring will be needed to determine if B/Yamagata antigens should remain in future influenza vaccine formulations. Limitations The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the VE estimates are preliminary and represent only a 3-month period with a smaller analytic sample, resulting in some VE estimates with wide CIs. Second, nearly 25% of the 1,194 otherwise eligible patients were missing RT-PCR results for influenza and were excluded from analysis. Although the REVELAC–i protocol indicates RT-PCR testing for all patients meeting SARI criteria, limited hospital resources for surveillance specimen collection during high-incidence periods might result in incomplete testing. Third, although statistical models accounted for important sources of confounding, the potential for unmeasured confounding associated with the likelihood of hospitalization or propensity for vaccination remains. Fourth, VE estimates from the Southern Hemisphere are important for supporting routine influenza vaccination programs, but these results might not be generalizable to other countries in the region with different vaccine target groups, timing of vaccination campaigns, or viral clade circulation. Finally, this analysis was unable to disaggregate previously unvaccinated children aged 6 months–9 years who received 2 doses of influenza vaccine from those receiving only 1 dose; thus, it is possible that influenza VE among young children restricted to those who received 2 doses of influenza vaccines would have been higher than VE among those with only a first, priming dose (3). Implications for Public Health Practice Preliminary REVELAC–i data from five Southern Hemisphere countries suggest that influenza vaccines were effective in preventing more than one half of influenza-associated hospitalizations among young children, persons with preexisting conditions, and older adults. The 2023–24 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation contains antigenically similar A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09–like virus (egg-based vaccines) and A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09–like virus (cell-based vaccines) and might offer similar protection against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 if these viruses predominate during the 2023–24 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. Evaluating influenza VE through integrated regional networks such as REVELAC–i provides valuable information that can guide public health practice. CDC and WHO recommend that health officials should encourage all eligible persons aged ≥6 months to seek influenza vaccination in accordance with national recommendations and to take other measures, including avoiding close contact with persons who are ill, to protect against influenza and potentially severe associated outcomes (3,7). Persons in the Northern Hemisphere who are at increased risk for influenza-associated complications, including children aged <2 years; persons with asthma; obesity; neurologic or neurodevelopmental conditions; blood disorders; chronic lung conditions; or endocrine, kidney, liver, metabolic, or heart diseases; who have had a stroke; or have a weakened immune system are especially encouraged to receive an influenza vaccination by September or October (7).

A colorized transmission electron micrograph of influenza A virus particles, colorized orange, isolated from a patient sample and then propagated in cell culture. NIAID Enrollment in a Phase 1 trial of a new investigational universal influenza vaccine candidate has begun at the National Institutes of Health’s Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The trial is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH, and will evaluate the investigational vaccine for safety and its ability to elicit an immune response. Currently available seasonal influenza (or “flu”) vaccines are effective at preventing specific strains of influenza. Each year, the vaccines are re-evaluated and changed to best match the strains of flu predicted to be the most dominant in the upcoming flu season. Most seasonal flu vaccines are designed to train the immune system to defend against three or four different common strains of flu, but a “universal” influenza vaccine might someday provide protection against many more. “An ideal universal influenza vaccine could be taken less frequently than once a year and protect against multiple strains of influenza virus. With each new universal influenza vaccine candidate and clinical trial, we take another step closer to that goal,” said Acting NIAID Director Hugh Auchincloss, M.D. The vaccine candidate under investigation, FluMos-v2, was designed by researchers at NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC). It is an adaptation of an earlier universal flu vaccine candidate, FluMos-v1, which began first-in-human testing in 2021 and is still undergoing trials. FluMos-v2 is designed to induce antibodies against many different influenza virus strains by displaying part of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein in repeating patterns on self-assembling nanoparticle scaffolds. Exposure to these harmless fragments of virus proteins prepares the immune system to recognize and fight the actual virus. When tested in animals, the experimental vaccine resulted in robust antibody responses. While the FluMos-v1 vaccine candidate displays HA from four strains of influenza virus, FluMos-v2 displays HA from six: four influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses. The researchers anticipate that this will further broaden vaccine recipients’ immunity, providing protection against a wider variety of influenza viruses. The new clinical trial is expected to enroll 24 healthy volunteers, aged 18-50 years, who will receive two intramuscular injections of the FluMos-v2 vaccine candidate. These injections will be given 16 weeks apart. At first, participants will be enrolled in the lower dose group (60 mcg per vaccination). If no safety concerns are identified after at least three participants have received this dose, enrollment will begin in the higher dose (180 mcg per vaccination) group. The study team plans to enroll 12 participants into each dosage group. For 40 weeks after their first vaccination, participants will receive regular follow-up phone calls and examinations to track their responses to the experimental vaccine. Blood samples will be taken during study visits to measure any immune responses to the vaccine candidate. Further information about the trial is available at clinicaltrials.gov using the identifier NCT05968989.

The hemagglutinin proteins are one of the genetic regions of the virus with a high potential for mutations. Due to the importance of predicting mutations in producing effective and low-cost vaccines, solutions that attempt to approach this problem have recently gained significant attention. A historical record of mutations has been used to train predictive models in such solutions. However, the imbalance between mutations and preserved proteins is a big challenge for the development of such models that need to be addressed. Here, we propose to tackle this challenge through anomaly detection (AD). AD is a well-established field in Machine Learning (ML) that tries to distinguish unseen anomalies from normal patterns using only normal training samples. By considering mutations as anomalous behavior, we could benefit existing rich solutions in this field that have emerged recently. Such methods also fit the problem setup of extreme imbalance between the number of unmutated vs. mutated training samples. Motivated by this formulation, our method tries to find a compact representation for unmutated samples while forcing anomalies to be separated from the normal ones. This helps the model to learn a shared unique representation between normal training samples as much as possible, which improves the discernibility and detectability of mutated samples from the unmutated ones at the test time. We conduct a large number of experiments on four publicly available datasets, consisting of three different hemagglutinin protein datasets, and one SARS-CoV-2 dataset, and show the effectiveness of our method through different standard criteria.

However, influenza viruses could lead to a life-threatening infection in the elderly and other risk group patients. Hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein located on the surface of influenza viruses and acts as an attaching ligand to the host cells and inserts the virus into the cells. To escape from immune responses, the virus can alter the antigenic features of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein by point mutations. This phenomenon is known as antigenic drifts. Mutations in the genes of influenza viruses could cause antigenic drift by changing the HA protein structure1,2,3,4. This results in a new strain of the virus that is not effectively recognized by the immune system and making the virus spread easily and causing an epidemic. Influenza viruses are classified in the Orthomyxoviridae family. In this family, there are three important human pathogens, including Alphainfluenzavirus, Betainfluenzavirus, and Gammainfluenzavirus. Influenza A virus is the only member of Alphainfluenzavirus, and is an important human pathogen due to its wide host range and the higher rate of drift and shift mutations5,6,7.HA is the main part of the virus attachment to the host cell receptor. The globular head domain of HA, which is critical for neutralizing antibody generation by the host immune system, is one of the most potent genomic locations for mutation. Influenza A viruses are divided into two different groups based on the globular head domain. The HA 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, and 18 types are placed in one group, and types 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 15 are considered members of the second group of HAs8. The Cb, Ca, Sb, and Sa are four important antigenic sites in the H1 domain of HA9,10,11. The amino acid residues number 143, 156, 158, 190, 193, and 197 are the most important residues for evolutionary and antigenic features of HA112. The role of HA1 mutations in the adequacy of influenza vaccination has made WHO Collaborating Centers and Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC)13 responsible for functional monitoring, reports, and decision for new season vaccines. Despite this delicate process, there are shortages and some strain mismatches between the vaccine strains and circulating strains14,15.In the current study, we also evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutations as an extra evaluation and a demo for future consideration in this field. The SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is the etiological agent for the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease-2019) pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 is a Betacoronavirus and a member of the sarbecoviruses sublineage16. The virus genome is an ssRNA (Single strand RNA) of 34kb in length. SARS-CoV-2 contains different genes including ORF1a/b, Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), Nucleoprotein (N), and accessory ORFs17. The virus binds into cells by using the S protein attachment to the cellular receptor ACE-2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)18. The S protein is the most important antigenic part of the virus19.In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms have achieved human or even super-human performance on different tasks such as image classification20, text classification21, action recognition22, etc. Anomaly Detection (AD) is a sub-domain of AI that is responsible for learning a normal representation space and detecting anomalous samples at the test time by exploiting the learned representation. Due to different challenges in the labeling of anomalous samples, such as the high cost or rareness of such samples, most methods in this domain only use normal samples for the training. This is called unsupervised AD. Alternatively, one may use a very limited number of labeled anomalous samples in the training process, which is called the semi-supervised AD23.Unsupervised24,25,26,27,28 and semi-supervised29,30 anomaly detection methods have recently achieved satisfactory results on a variety of domains such as image, text, time-series, and video. Deep Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection (DeepSAD)29, as a recently proposed semi-supervised AD method, made clear that semi-supervised anomaly detectors are significantly superior compared to the supervised training classification algorithms, specifically when the training dataset is complex, and the number of normal samples is much higher than the anomalous ones. This is because anomaly detectors attempt to find a compact representation space for the normal samples while maximizing the margin that exists between normal and abnormal ones. This helps them to learn the most general and unique features of the normal samples, and not rely overly on the contrast that exists between normal and anomalous samples to classify them.Since in the mutation prediction tasks the number of unmutated samples is much higher than the mutated ones, the problem can be formulated as an anomaly detection task. In this formulation, unmutated and mutated samples are considered as normal and anomalous samples, respectively. The benefits of this approach are two-fold. Firstly, a semantically meaningful representation could be learned even with a small number of training samples, which makes generalization to unseen test time samples possible. Secondly, as the finding and labeling procedure of mutated viruses is an expensive and time-consuming process, anomaly detectors could work fine with, or without a limited number of anomalous or mutated, training samples23.By this motivation, we propose the first anomaly detection framework for predicting virus mutations. We use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)31 neural network in combination with the Deep Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection (DeepSAD) loss29 to not only learn long-term input dependencies but also to find a semantic representation space for the mutated and unmutated training samples. Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of the proposed method. We conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our method in improving the average recall, F1-score, precision, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) for three different publicly available Influenza datasets.Figure 1The overall architecture of our method. First, the raw data is processed and the output \((X^{t}_1, X^{t}_2,\ldots , X^{t}_n)\) is prepared at the time step t, where n is the embedding dimensions, t denotes the time. After the pre-processing phase, LSTM cells are used to produce hidden states, \(h_i\), for each time point t. Then, the attention function takes \(h_i\) and the cell state \(s_{t-1}\), and outputs \(e^{i}_{t}\). Next, by using a softmax function, the weights \(w^{i}_{t}\)’s are produced. The weighted sum of the hidden states, \(h_{i}\)’s, is obtained by using the mentioned weights. The output of this weighted sum, \(c_t\), and the hidden state \(h_{t}\) will then be used to produce the encoded vector \({\hat{h}}_t\). At the last step, the DeepSAD loss function is applied to \({\hat{h}}_t\) to decide whether the input data is in-class (normal) 1 or out-class (anomaly) − 1.Full size imageBackgroundFor the sake of clarity, we discuss some of the important prerequisites from deep learning literature in this section. At first, some Recurrent Neural Network architectures, such as LSTMs31, are discussed. Then, a brief introduction to the anomaly detection methods is presented.Recurrent neural networks (RNN)RNNs are broadly used to model the data sequential dependencies, where the sequence could be formed based on temporal or spatial arrangements. Initial architectures of RNNs, such as the vanilla RNN, suffer from memorizing long-term as well as short-term dependencies. To address this issue, alternative architectures, such as LSTM31 networks, bi-directional RNNs32, and gated recurrent units33 GRU’s have been introduced. All these approaches attempt to summarize previous inputs into their hidden state that is updated in each time step t. The mentioned information is regulated using some parameters or gates. For instance, the LSTM network consists of LSTM cells. Each cell contains a state, \(h_t\), and memory, \(s_t\). These two are updated based on three different gates that are called input gate, \(i_t\), forget gate, \(f_t\), and output gate, \(o_t\). The input gate selects some of the memory dimensions to modify (Eq. 2). The forget gate decides which memory cell dimensions should be ignored in the next time step (Eq. 1). The output gate decides which dimensions of the memory should be transferred to the state (Eq. 3). The cell and state vectors are updated based on these gates and activation values that are produced through the tanh activation (Eqs. 4, 5). Specifically, the memory constitutes previous memory dimensions that are not forgotten, plus the input activation values that the input gate selects. Finally, the state constitutes memory activation values that are selected by the output gate. In all equations the parameters \(W_f, W_i, W_o, W_s\) and \(b_f, b_i, b_o, b_s\) are shared between the cells and are learned during the training process. This recurrent behavior of the LSMT model, where \(h_t\) and \(s_t\) are a function of \(h_{t-1}\) and \(s_{t-1}\), these models have the ability to take input from varying lengths, and the length of the sequence does not need to be fixed.Note that a sigmoid activation function is used in the gates to map the gate outputs between zero and one, which models the selection, i.e., gate output of 1 represents the complete selection of an embedding, and the 0 value corresponds to a complete non-selection. A tanh activation function is used in the cell and state update rules to produce activation values that are between − 1 and 1.$$\begin{aligned} f^{}_{t}&= \sigma (W^{}_{f} [h^{}_{t-1} ; x^{}_{t}] + b^{}_{f} ) \end{aligned}$$ (1) $$\begin{aligned} i^{}_{t}&= \sigma (W^{}_{i} [h^{}_{t-1} ; x^{}_{t}] + b^{}_{i} ) \end{aligned}$$ (2) $$\begin{aligned} o^{}_{t}&= \sigma (W^{}_{o} [h^{}_{t-1} ; x^{}_{t}] + b^{}_{o} ) \end{aligned}$$ (3) $$\begin{aligned} s^{}_{t}&= f^{}_{t} \odot s^{}_{t-1} + i^{}_{t} \odot tanh(W^{}_{s}[h^{}_{t-1} ; x^{}_{t}] + b^{}_{s}) \end{aligned}$$ (4) $$\begin{aligned} h^{}_{t}&= o^{}_{t} \odot tanh(s^{}_{t}) \end{aligned}$$ (5) Despite huge efforts on making different LSTM architectures to improve its performance, no architecture has been proposed yet that is generally better than the original one34. Therefore, our proposed method is based on the LSTM networks with some improvements on its ability to maintain long-term information and interpretability.Anomaly detectionAs mentioned before, anomaly detection is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence seeking to solve one-class classification problems. One-class methods only access the labels of one category of a dataset, called the normal class35. These methods then seek to design a classifier that can distinguish the normal class vs. the unseen classes, which is also referred to as anomaly classes. For instance, in mutation prediction problems, the anomaly detection method assumes access to only unmutated samples. This setup could be adopted for reasons such as the large cost of the data-gathering process from both kinds of mutated and unmutated classes, or even the impossibility of gathering all kinds of mutations in our training dataset. Such issues make the classification setup ineffective, as the classifier may get biased towards accurate prediction of only known mutations that are reflected in the training set. Deep Support Vector Data Description (DSVDD)24 is one of the basic anomaly detection methods that is trained in an unsupervised manner. It tries to find a latent space and the most compact hyper-sphere that contains the normal training samples in this space. The pre-assumption of DSVDD is that anomalous samples layout of the circle in contrast to normal ones, which could make them detectable. Recently, Chong et al.36 have shown the vulnerability of this method to the mode collapse, i.e., convergence of all data points to a single point in the latent space, due to its unsupervised training process. To alleviate this issue, DSAD29 suggests using a limited number of anomalous training samples to train DSVDD and achieved satisfying results. It has shown that a limited number of anomalous samples is enough to not only prevent the mode collapse but also enhance the supervised classifiers’ accuracy, specifically when training samples are significantly imbalanced toward the normal class.From a different point of view, autoencoder(AE) is another dominant framework that is used in the field. Owing to their unsupervised training process, they are intrigued for formulating anomaly detection problems based on their abilities. They are trained on normal training samples by this pre-assumption that they would be reconstructed well at the test time compared to the abnormal inputs. As the primary versions of autoencoders have shown deficiencies in their performance when the training dataset becomes complex, some variants of AE-based methods have been proposed based on generative adversarial networks 37,38,39, adversarial robust training 25, or self-supervised learning methods 40.Experiments and resultsDatasetFor the experiments on HA, we used the dataset provided in Tempel41. The data is hosted at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-pJGBsVfIqCEizetTQe43OQJvkmhocdW. This dataset includes influenza subtypes H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1, which have sequence lengths of 566, 566, and 568, respectively. The number of available HA sequences in each year for all three subtypes is provided in Table 1.Table 1 Number of HA samples for each subtypes from 2001 to 2016.Full size tableFor the experiments on SARS-CoV-2, we selected the RBD domain of spike nucleotide sequences, with a length of 1273, in the United Kingdom from January 1, 2020, to the last day of December 2020. The number of the available sequences in each month is provided in Table 2. In our current study, we just used one year period of time for SARS-CoV-2 as an introduction for future research and the data and results seem promising but limited and not completely validated. This mutation prediction for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike gene needs future studiesThe studies are performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and are carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.Table 2 Number of sequence samples from January 2020 to December 2020.Full size tableImplementationWe use PyTorch and Scikit-learn in our implementations. For the experiments that are performed on H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1, similar to the previously proposed method Tempel41, the first 1000 samples per year are chosen for training and testing. Then, the first 80% of the samples in each year are selected as the training set, and the remaining 20% are set as the test set. For our model, since validation is also needed for finding the best threshold, the first 10% of the training set is used for validation, and the remaining 90% for training. We use a batch size of 256, a learning rate of 0.001, and gradient descent for the optimization. Also, similar to Tempel, hidden layer size and dropout percentage are set to 128 and 0.5, respectively. As Fig. S3 shows, validation curves can be used as a good hint to stop the training process on the 50th epoch, in which the model has converged. Therefore, we have trained our model for 50 training epochs.The bioinformatics pipeline for the suggested amino acid alteration locationsAll of the amino acid alteration locations that are suggested by the algorithm are evaluated by a simple alignment analysis. After the model training, possible amino acid alteration locations for 2016 influenza H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 are listed based on the highest recall and precision. The influenza virus sequences for 2016 are obtained from the NCBI influenza database. A random 100 full-length samples from 2016 influenza circulating strains are used as a sample for amino acid alteration locations evaluation. In addition, the alterations are evaluated based on the suggested vaccine strains for the 2016–2017 season (stains include: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (B/Victoria lineage))42. All of the sampling influenza sequences from 2016 are aligned, and the alignment and amino acid locations are visualized in CLC Workbench43. Major epitopes are marked based on the previous studies for H1N144 and H3N245. The H5N1 influenza was not reported for the human host during 2016, hence for the mutation assessment for this dataset, we use all of the hosts during 2016 and mostly avians.BaselinesIn this section, we compare our method with other recently proposed anomaly detection (AD) methods that can be easily adapted to our task. Although some approaches such as Golan et al.46 and Bergman et al.47 achieve top performance in anomaly detection problems, they use self-supervised learning methods that are specialized for the image processing tasks. Consequently, they reach weak performance on our datasets. Table 3 includes the performance of Bergman et al., called GOAD, compared to the other methods. The parameter T represents the time-series sequence length ending in the year 2016. For the sake of equality in our comparisons, we have chosen T to be 5, 10, and 15, similar to Tempel41. Besides, repeating experiments for different T values gives a more comprehensive intuition on the sensitivity of the methods.Some AD algorithms are not domain-specific such as autoencoder-based (AE) approaches. We have reported the performance of ARAE25 as a stable, domain-agnostic, and high-performance approach. As ARAE is trained in a fully unsupervised training manner, using only unmutated training samples, its results are not competitive with the semi-supervised learning methods. Besides, AEs are not effective when facing complex datasets.Moreover, we report the performance of a similar semi-supervised anomaly detection method that has been proposed recently, ESAD48. It uses an AE-Based approach but employs both kinds of negative (unmutated) and positive (mutated) samples in its loss function. Finally, the performance of the original vanilla DeepSAD method, without our proposed modifications in Eq. (12), is reported in Table 3.Table 3 Precision, recall and F1-score on H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 datasets for \(T \in \{5,10,15\}\).Full size tableResultsWe report the mean and standard deviation of the metrics that are used to evaluate our method in different experiments. The model is trained for 5 trials. Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7 show the performance of our method compared to Tempel41, which is a recently proposed SOTA on the HA datasets. For each experiment, Area Under Curve (AUC), F1-Score, recall, and precision are reported as in other related works. To report Tempel’s results, we use the original implementation that is publicly available on the reported link in their paper. Following the experiments on HA, we have also conducted similar experiments on the SARS-CoV-2 dataset for \(T \in \{5,10\}\). Unlike the experiments on HA, for these experiments, T presents time-series sequence length in months rather than years.Comparison of AUC, F1-score, recall, and precisionAs it is shown, our method achieves competitive or significantly superior results in all standard criteria AUC, F1, recall, and precision averaged across all T values on HA datasets. It is good to notice that our method is consistently better than Temple when the parameter T is small, i.e. \(T = 5\), on HA training, sets for all different measures. This could be the effect of using an anomaly detection loss to train our model. Since DeepSAD loss attempts to find a shared representation space for the unmutated samples, it uses the given training set efficiently and, in the best scenario, extracts the most general features of them.Table 4 AUC comparison on H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 datasets for \(T \in \{5,10,15\}\).Full size tableTable 5 F1-Score of predictions on H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 datasets for \(T \in \{5,10,15\}\).Full size tableTable 6 Recall of predictions on H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 datasets for \(T \in \{5,10,15\}\).Full size tableTable 7 Precision of predictions on H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 datasets for \(T \in \{5,10,15\}\).Full size tableStopping criterion of the training processAs mentioned before, we use validation data to find the best point to cut the training process. Figure S3 shows the F1-score curves of the validation and test tests. As is depicted, the validation curves almost always follow their corresponding test curves, which shows their usability in determining the points to stop the training process. Note that the smaller the value of parameter T, the more the complexity of finding a good representation space. Therefore, a larger number of training samples is needed to approximately make the validation and test distributions similar, and consequently, some validation curves do not completely follow the test curves.Comparison of ROC curvesFigures S4 and S5 show the ROC curves of our methods compared to Tempel. As it is obvious, our method always has a lesser value of false-positive rate for high true positive rate values for all T values on all HA test datasets. This can be justified by the margin that exists between the normal and abnormal distributions. The HSC loss attempts to make this margin as large as possible, but classification-based approaches such as Tempel only try to minimize the cross-entropy loss that does not consider maximizing the margin explicitly. This helps our model to be more robust against noises that exist in our training datasets, which are typical considering the difficulties of the dataset-making process. Moreover, for the SARS-CoV-2 dataset, our method, in setups with lower false-positive rates, shows a higher true-positive rate compared to Tempel.Ablation study resultsWe have also conducted further experiments using a different model called transformers for predicting the mutations. The results for these experiments on HA are shown in Table 8. Details about the mechanism of the transformers are provided in the ablation section of methods.Table 8 Recall, F1-score and AUC on H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 datasets for \(T \in \{5,10,15\}\).Full size tableMutation prediction results in the real-world dataset assessmentAfter the evaluation of possible amino acid alterations, mutations that exhibit top recall and precision rates for T = 5, T = 10, and T = 15 are listed and assessed based on random samples of the 2016 reported influenza sequences and the 2016–2017 season vaccine strain. Table S1 represents the model’s results for different possible amino acid alteration locations and their presence in the random sampling data from the 2016 reported stains. It should be noted that based on the model’s results, each reported alteration, as an amino acid number is associated with its previous and next amino acid. The proposed alterations by the algorithm in sampling data are evaluated separately and regardless of the algorithm ROC curve for the mutations. Furthermore, the proposed alteration positions that do not depict any mutations in Figs. S1 and S2 or Table S1 in the sampling aligned data from the 2016 year do not express that there is no mutation in all of the years of the data set for that particular position. The mutations in these particular locations do not appear in the current random sampling due to the low stability or frequency of the mutation.H1N1 influenza ABy the evaluation of the antigenic sites of influenza H1N1 amino acid sequence, the proposed model highlights some important alterations in amino acid numbers 168, 170, 205, and 253 in three important sites Ca, Sa, and Sb. Meanwhile, there are too many missed important amino acid alterations in Sa, Sb, and especially in Ca. More details are provided in Fig. S1. In the comparison of our current anomaly detection method with the suggested method by Tempel, there are three differences in alteration positions. These differences refer to the amino acid numbers 165 and 174 by Tempel and 166 in our model. The residues 165 and 166 did not represent any important alterations while 174 is located in Sa.H3N2 influenza ABy the evaluation of the antigenic sites of influenza H3N2 amino acid sequence, the model proposed some important alterations in amino acid number 192 in antigenic Site B and amino acid 226 in the Receptor binding site (RBS). Some alterations in other locations are illustrated in Fig. S2. It should be mentioned that some important alterations in antigenic sites Lower HA, site A, and Site B are missed. In the comparison of our model and Tempel, each model proposed two positions that the other model did not detect. The residues 88 and 260 are suggested by the Tempel model and not by our current model. Residue 88 represents variable positions in the sequence but not epitope. While amino acid number 260 is an epitope location and is missed by our model. Our model suggests an alteration in the amino acids numbers 177 and 193 more than the Tempel model. The amino acid 177 does not reflect any epitope or high prevalence variation, while the 193 is a true mutation in site B.H5N1 influenza AThe influenza H5N1 amino acid sequence was not evaluated in the reported sequences from the 2016 human host due to the lack of reports in that particular year. For the evaluation of the model and multiple sequence alignment for more important alteration positions in Table S1, we used the avian sequences of the H5N1 during 2016 due to the nature of the virus. The amino acids numbers 82, 116, 152, 166, 172, 179, 185, 205, and 242 seem to be important for further studies and antigenic evaluation. Moreover, by comparing our current model and the Tempel model, there are two different mutation locations in each (118 and 130 for Tempel in comparison with 172 and 179). The conducted study reveals two important mutation positions in SARS-CoV-2. The data was collected on 8 June 2021. The proposed mutation positions are the 476 and 500 amino acid locations. The amino acid number 500 represents the Alpha variant-specific mutation (N501Y) on the date of the dataset preparation. Another proposed mutation position in 476 did not represent any particular association with any variants except the Omicron variant (S477N). It has to be noted that at the time of the database preparation, there was no clue about the Omicron variant, and this mutation in the 476 positions did not reflect any particular result.DiscussionEvery year, hundreds of thousands of deaths are reported from influenza disease. Despite many efforts to develop new treatments and vaccines, due to the high genetic diversity of the influenza viruses (IVs), complete success has not been achieved yet. This extended genetic diversity is due to the RNA genome of these viruses. Between the proteins encoded by the IVs genome, hemagglutinin (HA) is among the most important proteins that play key roles in the infectivity and propagation of the virus49. This glycoprotein plays a paramount role in binding to the Sialic acid, the ligand of the virus at the surface of the host cell, as well as fusion into the cell. In fact, the pathogenicity of IVs depends on efficient cleavage of hemagglutinin precursor to HA1 and HA2 proteins, in which the former is responsible for receptor-binding activity and the latter anchors the HA1 and is also responsible for pH-dependent fusion50. This reason, along with the increased resistance to currently available classes of drugs, which inhibit M2 ion channels and neuraminidase, has made inhibition of hemagglutinin one of the attractive goals for the development of anti-influenza drugs in recent years51. In addition to the medications, the immune system uses HA as a target in response to infection. Once the infection is established, the adaptive immune system triggers a strong response against the virus, in which neutralizing antibodies are produced against the virus. HA is the major target of these neutralizing antibodies52. Since these antibodies are strain specific53, mutations in the HA epitopes that are targeted by these antibodies may change the antigenicity of the virus and lead to the emergence of antibody- and vaccine-escape strains52,54. After the entrance of viruses to the body and the production of neutralizing antibodies by the immune cells, antibody-escape viruses evade the host immune system, a phenomenon called the selection of “antibody escape” variants52.The influenza virus is highly prone to antigenic changes. These changes are often caused by two main mechanisms called antigen shift and drift. If a cell is infected with two different genotypes of the IVs, a new strain may develop due to the placement of different parts of the two strains into new viral particles. This phenomenon, which can lead to the generation of new pandemic strains, is called the antigen shift. Influenza viruses are highly prone to point mutations due to the lack of proofreading ability of their RNA genome. The accumulation of these point mutations is called antigen drift. Occurrence of this phenomenon in the gene encoding HA causes alterations in the structure and function of this protein55. As a result, the immune system is no longer able to detect the virus56. Therefore, this jeopardizes us at risk of future pandemics to which our bodies have no resistance57.Since HA has a critical role in the replication cycle of IVs, the occurrence of these changes has greatly contributed to the evolution of these viruses58. A series of mutations with few effects on the antigenicity of the IVs finally lead to intense antigenic drift, a phenomenon called “cluster transition,” which is the characteristic of the evolution of IVs59. Studies have shown that changes in the amino acid sequence of HA1 can tremendously alter the antigenicity of these viruses56. Thereby tracking these changes is essential to predict the future behaviors of the virus. Thyagarajan and Bloom mutagenized the HA gene of wild-type IVs to create codon-mutant libraries of the HA gene and then used these libraries to make a pool of mutants by reverse genetics. Using the Illumina deep mutational scanning, they found that there are more than 10,000 different probabilities for mutation in this protein. They have also cultured these mutants and investigated the mutated viruses. They have concluded that mutations mostly occur in the regions of the HA protein that is recognized by antibodies. Otherwise, the receptor-binding domain is less frequently subject to mutations and it is the possible reason why HA still targets the Sialic acid in spite of extensive mutations in this protein60.Determining the new antigenic variants of the IVs is critical in order to develop efficient flu vaccines. The WHO collaborates with a number of laboratories around the world to identify circulating influenza viruses in the human population (61. Traditionally, the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test has been used to evaluate antigenic variants of the virus, which is a time-consuming and hand-operated method62. However, advances in computer science and bioinformatics have led to the invention and development of faster and more accurate methods. By using scoring and regression methods on the sequences collected from the H3N2 flu virus between 1971 and 2002, Liao et al. proposed a method for predicting variants of the virus. According to their proposed method, influenza virus variants between 1999 and 2004 were predictable with an agreement rate of 91.67\(\%\). They also identified 20 amino acid positions whose changes significantly contribute to the development of new variants62. Yang et al. developed a learning sparse algorithm called AntigenCO, which uses the HA1 protein of the H3N2 virus to identify the superior determinant properties of the antigenic profiles in serological data. In addition to single mutations, their methods also used multiple simultaneous mutations or co-evolved sites in order to predict antigenicity. The prediction accuracy of the method studied in their work was 90.05%63. Łuksza et al. developed a model based on a mapping between the HA sequences and viral fitness. According to them, mutation at the epitope region is considered a positive fitness effect as it can induce cross-immunity between the flu strains. Conversely, the incidence of mutation outside of the epitope site is regarded as a fitness cost. Using this system, viral clades that are involved in future epidemics can be predicted64. Yin et al. developed a computational method to predict suitable strains for vaccination by generating time-series training samples with splittings and embeddings. Their method uses the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which helps in performing sequence-to-sequence prediction using H3N2 flu strains identified between 2006 and 2017. The suggested strains by their method had 98% similarity to the recommended vaccine strains65. In the current work, we study an anomaly detection-based approach to predicting Influenza mutations. The study results suggest some important alteration positions in the HA of influenza H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1. This multidisciplinary study shows promising and reliable results in the mutation prediction of the influenza virus in comparison with mentioned previous studies. Based on the nature of anomaly detection, this approach seems to be appropriate for mutation prediction analysis in viral genomes for further studies. By considering the complete HA gene and the ROC curves, our current model represents great performance. However, in the assessment of important antigenic sites, more optimization would be critical for further studies. Furthermore, one of the major limitations in the current study was the limited available sequences for different years. This limitation reflects a minor problem in our current research by considering the parameter T. Meanwhile, great efforts during the time of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the availability of a great amount of the primary sequence data could be promising for further studies. By considering the advancement of high throughput sequencing techniques, this limitation in sequences can be solved in the future. Another limitation of our current study was the evaluation of all lineages and clades of any H type influenza. Different clades or lineages in H1N1 have unique evolutions and need more focus in future studies in light of the improving primary sequence limitation. In addition, another limitation in the analysis of the H5N1 mutations, which needs to be mentioned, is the lack of H5N1 reports in human hosts during 2016. Furthermore, this needs to be considered that, another limitation in our current study is the theory of mutational pressure in the prediction of positions66. This could be a lead for future more developed models. It could be also noted that by using our model we cannot differentiate between mutation-prone gene locations and the positive pressure of natural selection in our sequence. This could be a challenging perspective for future studies and developing more accuracy in models.Recently, this RNN model has been used to predict the antigenic changes of the Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) by Sawmya et al67. They used a pipeline method to predict mutations in some regions of the SARS-COV-2 gene. At first, genes are classified according to the country, and their phylogenetic tree is obtained. In the next step, using algorithmic methods and methods used in machine learning, positions of genes that are distinct in terms of characteristics are obtained. Finally, the occurrence of mutations in these sites is predicted by using the CNN-RNN network. Considering the SARS-CoV-2, the current study’s data is just preliminary and just a perspective for further studies. This preliminary data represents low productivity in all other potential positions for mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 S gene. But highlights an important position for mutation in amino acid number 500 (represents N501Y mutation in the Alpha variant).MethodsThe influenza virus HA and SARS-CoV-2 RBD database for amino acid sequencesThe influenza virus sequences are obtained from the NCBI influenza database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/FLU.html. The amino acid sequences were obtained without the limitation in time for the report. The amino acid sequences for the human hosts in the north hemisphere referring to the H1 of the H1N1 strains were downloaded. Only the full-length sequences for the HA region were used for the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). The MSA is performed by the MAFFT algorithm. For the experiments on SARS-CoV-2, we used the COVID-19 data portal provided by the European COVID-19 Data Platform and EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)68.Proposed methodThe mutation prediction problem can be formulated as the time series anomaly detection. For getting the time series data out of the raw amino-acid sequence, a preprocessing method is employed. Firstly, the ambiguous amino acids are replaced with one of the common 20 amino acids. Then, the amino acid sequences are clustered, and the primary time series sequence is obtained from them. Lastly, the amino acids are represented in some feature space using the prot2vec69 method. In order to formulate the problem as the anomaly detection, we selected temporal attention-based RNN70 as the backbone that is trained with a DeepSAD loss function. This lets us not only preserve the sequential aspect of the input but also benefit from the anomaly detection algorithms. Temporal attention-based RNN has shown significantly better performance compared to LSTM networks in preserving long-term dependencies. Besides, owing to the use of the attention mechanism, it only focuses on the important features of its input, which is helpful in complex problems such as mutation prediction tasks. In addition, the DeepSAD loss function helps our model not only focus on the important parts of the input sequence but also encapsulate them in a compact representation space. This is exactly what we look for in the mutation prediction problem. Our codes are made publicly available at https://github.comohban-lab/Tempel-HSC- for the sake of reproducibility.PreprocessingThe preprocessing, similar to Yin et al.41, includes three major steps: 1. replacing obscure amino acids; 2. acquiring time series sequences; 3. representing the amino acids in a feature space. Proteins consist of 20 common amino acids. Due to errors in reading the protein sequence in the stated datasets, there might be some ambiguous amino acids or letters, such as ’B’, ’Z’, ’J’, and ’X’, in the sites that are needed to be replaced with a probable amino acid. In this step, ’Z’ will be randomly replaced with one of ’D’ or ’N’ amino acids, ’Z’ with one of ’E’ or ’Q’, ’J’ with one of ’I’ or ’L’, and ’X’ with all amino acids. After replacement, for obtaining the time series sequences, samples in each year are divided into k clusters using the k-means algorithm. For our experiments, similar to Yin et al., we set \(k=3\). Then, by a similarity metric such as the Euclidean distance, for each cluster in a year, the closest cluster in the next year is selected. By finding the closest cluster pairs in two consecutive years, multiple sequences of clusters are formed. For example, assume that in the year t, the cluster M is closest to the cluster N in the year \(t+1\), and the cluster O in the year \(t+2\) is closest to the cluster N. So \(M, N, O, \dots\) will make a cluster sequence. From each cluster in a cluster sequence, a protein sample is randomly selected, and hence from this sequence, a time series sequence of data is created. In feature space representation, each amino acid is converted to a vector using ProtVec69. The representation is calculated by the following equation:$$\begin{aligned} x^t_i = \frac{\sum \limits _{j = -d}^{d} v_{i+j}^t}{2d+1} \end{aligned}$$ (6) where \(v_i^k\) is the vector output of ProtVec for the i-th amino acid in a sample gathered in the year t. d shows the number of amino acid neighbors. Here, like Yin et al., representations are evaluated in 3-grams, so d is set to 1. After these steps, specific site positions, which are also known as epitopes, are only selected in each protein sequence, and the RNN model is only trained and tested on these sites.To generate the label for position i in the sequences, assuming the dataset sequences are until year \(T+1\), the nucleotide value in position i at time \(T+1\) is compared to the nucleotide value in position i at time T. If the values differ, it indicates a mutation and hence it is labeled as 0 (anomaly), otherwise the data is labeled 1. Afterward, for training and testing, only the sequences up to year T are given as the input to the model.Temporal attentionGiven a specific time series sequence \((x_1, x_2,\dots ,x_t)\), a temporal attention mechanism is used for encoding the sequence. Architectures such as LSTM and GRU have a performance decay when the input length increases. By applying the temporal attention mechanism to the mentioned architectures, we are able to consider each element of the sequence in the final encoding of the sequence and overcome this issue. In this mechanism, in order to calculate attention weights \(w_{ji}\), first, an attention function f takes the hidden state \(h_{i}\) for the time i and the cell state \(s_{j-1}\) for the time \(j-1\) from the LSTM cell and outputs a scalar value \(e_{ji}\):$$\begin{aligned} e_{ji} = f(s_{j-1}, h_i). \end{aligned}$$ (7) The attention function f is defined as:$$\begin{aligned} f(s_{j-1}, h_i) = W^{}_{attn}[s_{j-1} ; h_i] + b^{}_{attn}, \end{aligned}$$ (8) Where \(W^{}_{attn}\) and \(b^{}_{attn}\) are learned through the training process. Then using a softmax function, the weight \(w_{ti}\) is calculated and applied to the hidden states as below:$$\begin{aligned} w_{ji}&= \frac{\exp (e_{ji})}{\sum \limits _{k=1}^{j-1} \exp (e_{jk})}\end{aligned}$$ (9) $$\begin{aligned} z_j&= \sum \limits _{k=1}^{j-1} w_{jk}h_k, \end{aligned}$$ (10) where \(z_j\) is the context vector for the time t. In the last step, using the following equation, the encoded vector \({\hat{h}}_j\) at time j is calculated:$$\begin{aligned} {\hat{h}}_j = tanh(W^{}_{{\hat{h}}}[z^{}_{j} ; h^{}_{j}] + b^{}_{{\hat{h}}}), \end{aligned}$$ (11) where \(W^{}_{{\hat{h}}}\) and \(b^{}_{{\hat{h}}}\) are learned through the training process. In the next step, the DeepSAD loss discussed in the next section is applied to the encoded vector \({\hat{h}}_{T}\), where T is the length of the input time series sequence.DeepSAD lossAs mentioned earlier, we use DeepSAD loss function29 on temporal attention RNN to capture normal features. DeepSAD loss function is defined in Eq. (12).$$\begin{aligned} \dfrac{1}{m + n} \sum _{i=1}^n \Vert \phi ({\hat{h}}_{i}; \theta ) - c\Vert ^{2} + \dfrac{\eta }{m + n} \sum _{j=n+1}^{m+n} (\Vert \phi ({\hat{h}}_{j}; \theta ) - c\Vert ^{2})^{-1} + \dfrac{\lambda }{2} \sum _{l=1}^L \Vert \theta ^{l}\Vert ^{2}_{F} \end{aligned}$$ (12) Here, \(\phi (.; \theta )\) is a neural network, our temporal attention-based RNN and \(\theta\) denotes the parameters of \(\phi\). Also, c is a hyper-parameter that is set before the training process. By minimizing the loss function, normal samples are centralized in a minimum volume hyper-sphere with a center c, while abnormal samples are forced to be out of it. Also, \(\eta\) is a hyper-parameter that can assign extra weight to the abnormal samples to mitigate the imbalanced training samples issue. Finally, n and m denote the number of normal and abnormal training samples, respectively.As mentioned in Ruff et al.30 use of the radial basis function in the DeepSAD loss produces better results. Therefore, the Eq. (13) that is called the hyper-sphere classifier (HSC) loss function is used in all our experiments:$$\begin{aligned} \dfrac{1}{m + n} (\sum _{i=1}^{m+n} y^{}_{i} \Vert {\phi ({\hat{h}}_{i}; \theta )}\Vert ^2 - (1 - y^{}_{i}) \log (1 - \exp (-(\sqrt{\Vert {\phi ({\hat{h}}_{i}; \theta )}\Vert ^2 + 1} - 1)))) \end{aligned}$$ (13) HSC forces normal data to be mapped near the origin, that is, the center is set to zero. Since all data in our dataset has a label, the dataset is assumed to be a set of pairs \((x^{}_{i}, y^{}_{i})\). Here, \(m + n\) is the number of training samples, and \(y \in\) {0, 1}, where \(y=1\) shows normal data (in our case, an unmutated virus), and \(y=0\) shows a mutated sample.AblationAs described above, RNNs are one of the mechanisms that can produce satisfactory results in the case of sequence transduction. However, with all their efficiencies, they have the problem of capturing long-term dependencies, which is mainly because of the fact that input sequences are passed at each step in a chain, and if the chain becomes longer, it will be more probable that the information gets lost. Unlike RNNs, Transformers can be very efficient in retaining long-term dependencies. Transformers are a kind of Neural Network architecture that has become popular due to their performance in various fields. They were introduced to perform sequence transduction in which there are dependencies between input elements. Its architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder has some layers that together generate encodings that summarize each element in relation to all other elements in the sequence, through the self-attention mechanism. Each layer consists of a self-attention mechanism and a Feed-Forward Neural Network.When an input sequence is fed into the encoder, each input part flows through each of the two layers of the encoder. They first go through a self-attention mechanism, which learns three weight matrices; the query weights \(W_{Q}\), the key weights \(W_{K}\), and the value weights \(W_{V}\). For each input element i, the input \(x_{i}\) is multiplied by each of the three vectors. This will produce a query vector \(q_{i} = x_{i}W_{Q}\), a key vector \(k_{i} = x_{i}W_{K}\), and a value vector \(v_{i} = x_{i}W_{V}\). The attention weight \(a_{ij}\) from the input element i to the input element j can be obtained by applying the dot product between \(q_{i}\) and \(k_{j}\). Then, the attention weights are divided by \(d_{k}\), which is the dimension of the key vectors. This leads to having more stable gradients, which is an advantage over RNNs. Then, we pass the results through a softmax function in order to normalize the weights. Next, we multiply each value vector by the softmax score, and at the end, we sum up these weighted value vectors as follows:$$\begin{aligned} Attention(q_{i}, k_{i}, v_{i}) = Softmax \left( {\frac{q_{i} k^{T}_{i}}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}}\right) v_{i}. \end{aligned}$$ (14) The resulting vector would then be sent along with the Feed Forward Neural Network. The decoder functions in a similar way. The decoder module contains some layers that take all the encodings and use them to generate an output sequence. Each decoder layer has both components of an encoder layer but it also has an attention layer between the two components. This helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.Conclusion and future workIn this research, we have shown the effectiveness of anomaly detection approaches in predicting Influenza mutations by conducting extensive experiments. Due to the extreme imbalance between the training samples in such problems, anomaly detectors can extract useful information more efficiently and find shared, more robust features for the unmutated samples. Also, the results when the parameter T is small advocate the mentioned merits of our approach. For future works, we want to extend our experiments and provide some results on SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) mutation prediction, which can be very helpful in understanding its behavior for further applications.

Learn more about what the flu is, including its causes, symptoms and treatment.What is influenza (flu)?Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a highly contagious respiratory disease, states the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).Every year, the flu kills thousands; it's particularly dangerous for people who are very young or very old, or who have other health conditions such as heart disease or asthma. What causes the flu?Flu is caused by influenza viruses, says the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The annual seasonal flu is caused by influenza viruses type A and type B. Flu symptomsThe most common flu symptoms, as reported by the American Lung Association, include: ChillsCough, a dry coughDiarrheaFatigue (extreme tiredness) Fever that is high and comes on suddenlyHeadacheJoint painMuscle achesNasal congestionNauseaRunny noseSore throatVomiting How long does the flu last?Usually, the flu lasts between four and seven days. The CDC notes that babies and those with weakened immune systems could have it for a longer period of time. How long is the flu contagious?You can give the flu to someone else before you have any symptoms. That’s one of the reasons why it spreads so quickly and easily, notes the CDC. Even if you’re a healthy adult, you could be contagious a day before you experience symptoms and as many as seven days after you get sick. When is flu season?The flu season in the United States starts sometime in the late fall and can last through the end of May, states the American Academy of Pediatrics.Flu treatmentsThere are four antiviral drugs recommended by the CDC to treat the flu.Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu and generic)Zanamivir (Relenza)Peramivir (Rapivab)Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza)Flu medicinesThere are also over-the-counter medications available. They include:AcetaminophenIbuprofenCough expectorants Cough suppressantsIt is not recommended to give over-the-counter cough and cold medications to young children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t recommend over-the-counter cough and cold medications for children younger than 2, and manufacturers voluntarily have their labels state that their products are not for use in children under 4.These medications may cause severe, possibly life-threatening side effects in young children, and some products may have ingredients that may cause an accidental overdose.Consult with your child’s healthcare provider for information on what, if any, medications may be appropriate.Flu self-care tipsYou could recover faster if you practice these self-care tips, recommended by the Cleveland Clinic: Heating packs on aching musclesRest Stay hydratedIs there a flu shot available? It’s important to remember that the flu can be very serious. You could wind up in the hospital, and people with the flu or with complications of it can die. There is a vaccine for the flu. According to Yale Medicine, what the flu vaccine does is: Reduce the risk of illnessReduce the risk of hospitalizationReduce the risk of deathIt’s vital to get the flu shot every year because which influenza viruses are circulating most widely changes every year. Each year, the vaccine is customized to target the strongest strain. Flu shot side effects can include: Fatigue FeverHeadacheMuscle achesNauseaRedness where you received the shotSoreness where you received the shotSwelling where you received the shotLiving with the fluLiving with the flu is usually short term. If you or your child have flu symptoms for longer than a couple of weeks, that may be cause for concern and you should contact your doctor. See your doctor immediately, advises the American Lung Association, if you experience: Chest pain from coughingDifficulty breathingPhlegm you cough up that’s yellow, green or bloodyPediatric infectious diseases specialist Dr. Thomas Murray, of Yale Medicine, urges parents to pay attention to: Breathing troubleDehydration Low urine output (a symptom of dehydration)“If you have any concerns, call your pediatrician,” Murray advised in a recent Yale article. “And if a child who has flu starts to feel better and then suddenly gets worse, call your provider right away because sometimes they can have a bacterial infection after influenza.”In the United States, the flu is the most common infectious disease. Around 20 to 40 million people get it each year. Practice self-care, says Cleveland Clinic, and get some medicine to help you get through it.

Photo credit: Josie Weiss Share Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Email In June 2023, the Poland public health officials notified the World Health Organization of unusual deaths in cats across the country. Dozens were found to be positive for influenza A (H5N1). Fourteen cats are reported to have been euthanized, and a further 11 died, with the last death reported on 30 June. The source of the exposure of cats to the virus is currently unknown and epizootic investigations are ongoing. Sporadic infection of cats with A(H5N1) has previously been reported, but this is the first report of a high numbers of infected cats over a wide geographical area within a country. Feline A/H5N1 infections raise concerns that adaptation of avian viruses to cats—animals living in close contact with humans, and hunting birds—could represent the first step towards potential human-to-human transmission of Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs). Nearly all mammalian strains belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b were isolated within last two to three years, even though HPAI outbreaks have been occurring worldwide for over 20 years. The most plausible explanation for this situation is that the clade 2.3.4.4b, with point mutations, is indicative of adaptations to mammalian hosts. This case report provides the clinical description, along with pathological, virological, and bacteriological results of feline influenza A/H5N1 case, one of the series observed this summer in Poland. The virus was characterized as belonging to the clade 2.3.4.4.b with mutations indicating a mammalian spread. The source of the infection for the investigated cat remains unknown. The most common routes for cats to contract avian influenza virus appear to be direct contact with infected birds, consumption of raw poultry products, or hunting wild birds. These factors naturally put outdoor cats at higher risk. While it is impossible to control HPAI in wild birds, which serve as a mobile reservoir for IAV genes, cats in endemic areas should be prevented from going outdoors, hunting, and feeding on raw meat.

It is more likely to cause complications, such as pneumonia, in older adults than younger adults. This article explores how flu may affect older people, including symptoms, potential complications, and treatment. It also explains how people may help prevent the spread of flu and when they may need to speak with a healthcare professional.Flu resourcesFor more information and resources to help keep you and your loved ones healthy this flu season, visit our dedicated hub.OverviewShare on PinterestAlexey Kuzma/StocksyThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that during the October 2022 to April 2023 season, flu was responsible for the following: 27–54 million illnesses300,000–650,000 hospitalizations19,000–58,000 deathsPeople over the age of 65 have a higher chance of developing serious complications from the flu than younger, healthy adults. The CDC state that vaccination is the best way for a person to help prevent contracting the flu and any potentially severe complications.SymptomsFlu generally causes a rapid onset of symptoms. The virus usually takes about 2 days to incubate before a person’s symptoms start, though it can take 1–4 days.A person will often experience some of the following with flu:coughingfever or chillsbody or muscle achesa sore throata stuffy or runny nosefatigueheadachesWhile many people associate the flu with fevers, the CDC note that not everyone with the flu will develop a fever. Also, children have a higher chance of developing vomiting and diarrhea due to flu compared with adults.ComplicationsAdults over the age of 65 have a higher chance of developing severe flu complications compared with younger, healthy adults. A weakening immune system in older adults causes them to be more susceptible to serious illness. In addition, older individuals are more likely to have other health conditions, such as diabetes, that elevate their risk of developing complications from the flu.Pneumonia is a serious complication associated with the flu. In some cases, it can lead to death. Other potentially severe complications of the flu can include:encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brainsepsismyocarditis, which is inflammation of a muscle in the heartmyositis or rhabdomyolysis, which are types of muscle tissue inflammation multi-organ failure, such as kidney failure and respiratory failureAdditionally, flu can worsen conditions such as chronic heart disease and asthma, potentially causing asthma attacks. It may also lead to sinus or ear infections.TreatmentPeople do not always need formal medical treatment for flu. Those presenting with only mild symptoms may be able to use over-the-counter medications to treat their symptoms. They should then seek medical attention if they start to feel worse.However, the National Insitute on Aging (NIA) advises older individuals to speak with a healthcare professional if they contract flu.A doctor may prescribe antiviral medications to the following groups:older adultspeople presenting with moderate to severe flu symptomsindividuals who show signs of flu complicationsHealthcare professionals usually recommend that a person takes antiviral medication for a minimum of 5 days.A person may require hospitalization if they develop any complications. PreventionFlu may spread through tiny droplets when someone talks, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets may land on another person’s nose or mouth, causing them to contract the virus. A person can also get the virus from touching objects or surfaces that have the virus on them and then touching their mouth or nose. However, this is less common.Duration of transmissibilityA person is most likely to transmit flu to others in the first 3–4 days from symptom development. Some individuals may be able to transmit the virus 1 day before symptoms start and up to 5–7 days after they first feel unwell. Someone with a weakened immune system or a young child may be able to transmit the flu for a more extended period.Means of preventionThe CDC note that getting vaccinated is the most effective means of preventing the spread of the flu and reducing the risk of complications. About 2 weeks after a person receives a flu shot, their body creates antibodies that protect against flu. The CDC recommend all people over the age of 6 months receive the flu vaccine each year. In rare exceptions, a healthcare professional may recommend against someone receiving the vaccine. Though the flu vaccine can help prevent serious illness, it may not always prevent a person from getting sick due to flu. A person can take additional steps to help stop the spread of flu, including:staying home when sickwashing their hands regularly avoiding touching their nose, eyes, or mouthcovering their nose or mouth when coughing or sneezingavoiding close contact with others who are unwelldisinfecting and cleaning surfaces when someone is sick at home, school, or workWhen to speak with a doctor Most people over the age of 65 should seek medical attention at the first signs of illness with the flu, due to being at high risk of severe infection and complications. A person should also seek emergency medical attention if they experience any of the following with flu:persistent dizziness and confusionshortness of breath or trouble breathingpain or pressure in the chest or abdomen that does not go awaysevere muscle painfever and cough that improve but then worsen or returnseizuresworsening of any long-term health conditionsSummaryA person over the age of 65 has a higher risk of developing potentially dangerous complications from flu. It is best for people in this age group to consider getting a flu vaccination unless a healthcare professional instructs them not to do so, which only happens in rare cases. They also need to avoid contact with people who have the flu and seek medical help if they develop any flu-like symptoms.A doctor can provide further guidance and appropriate treatment for older individuals who contract the flu.Flu / Cold / SARSSeniors / AgingHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

Download PDF Copy By Pooja Toshniwal PahariaReviewed by Danielle Ellis, B.Sc.Sep 12 2023 In a recent study published in JAMA Network Open, researchers investigated the comparative efficacy and safety of the simultaneous coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and seasonal influenza vaccination regimen compared to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination alone among healthcare workers (HCWs) who had received one or two COVID-19 booster doses. Study: Immunogenicity and Reactogenicity of Coadministration of COVID-19 and Influenza Vaccines. Image Credit: Studio Romantic/Shutterstock.com Background Booster vaccinations are essential for HCWs who come into contact with people vulnerable to COVID-19 severity outcomes. In the initial days of the pandemic, several health groups advised that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza vaccines be administered individually. In the influenza season between 2022 and 2023, however, health organizations such as the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) advised simultaneous administration of vaccinations to boost vaccination adherence and reduce the healthcare burden. However, data on SARS-CoV-2 and influenza co-vaccination are limited. About the study In the present prospective cohort study, researchers evaluated the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza co-vaccination compared to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination alone. The study included HCWs working at the Sheba Medical Center (SMC) of Israel who had been administered the Influvac Tetra influenza vaccine (between 2022 and 2023), the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4/5 variant of concern (VOC)-encoding bivalent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, individually or in combination. Vaccines were administered from September 2022 onwards, and information was obtained through January 2023. The study participants filled out adverse drug reaction questionnaires and provided serum samples for the analysis. The outcome measures to analyze reactogenicity included symptoms developing post-vaccine administration, assessed based on digital questionnaires: fever, local symptoms, fatigue, weakness, systemic symptoms, and symptom duration. Post-vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) immunoglobulin (Ig) geometric mean titers (GMTs) and geometric mean ratios (GMRs) were determined using the restricted cubic spline method to assess immunogenicity. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was performed, and the odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were administered from 28 September 2022 onwards, whereas seasonal influenza vaccines (SIVs) were administered from 12 October 2022 onwards at the SMC. For the reactogenicity and immunogenicity assessments, HCWs who received vaccines till 29 November and 29 December 2022, respectively, were included. Reactogenicity was evaluated using electronic questionnaires distributed 62 days post-vaccination, addressing systemic and local symptoms. Individuals who received SARS-CoV-2 and/or SIV vaccinations during the period of the study and participated in the Sheba Medical Centre cohort were included in the analysis. The team excluded immunosuppressed individuals, those who received SIV and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on different days but less than a week apart, those who filled out the digital questionnaires within five days of vaccination, and those with incoherent or incomplete responses.

The team excluded individuals with immunosuppression, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the duration between receipt of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and post-vaccination serological testing, and the receipt of SIV and SARS-CoV-2 on different days but less than a week apart. Results Compared to SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations alone, systemic symptom risk was lower but non-significant among co-vaccinated individuals with lower but non-significant anti-S IgG titers. The reactogenicity evaluation included 588 individuals (out of 649 respondents): 146 SARS-CoV-2 and influenza co-vaccinees [median age, 61 years; 55% (n=81) females]; 85 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinees [median age, 71 years; 66% (n=56) females]; and 357 influenza vaccinees [median age, 55 years; 79% (n=282) females]. The immunogenicity evaluation included 151 HCWs: 74 individuals in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine cohort [median age, 67 years; 61% (n=45) females] and 77 individuals in the co-vaccination group [median age, 60 years; 55% (n=42) females]. Compared to SARS-CoV-2-only vaccinees, systemic symptom risk was comparable among co-vaccinated individuals (OR, 0.8). The estimated GMTs for the co-vaccination group were 0.8-fold lower than for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-only group. During the 60 follow-up days for the immunogenicity group, none of the participants contracted SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity analysis conducted included two healthcare workers who were removed from the primary analysis due to being diagnosed with COVID-19 during the period between receipt of the vaccine and post-vaccination serum testing, which showed that GMTs for the co-vaccinated group were 0.9 times lower compared to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-only group. The incidence rates of systemic reactions in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-only, SIV vaccination-only, and co-vaccination groups were 27%, 13%, and 28%, respectively. Compared to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-only group, the risk of systemic symptoms was lower among SIV recipients (OR, 0.2) but comparable among co-vaccinated individuals (OR, 0.8). Conclusion Overall, the study findings indicated that influenza co-vaccination, a combination of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, is an acceptable policy to increase adherence to both vaccines. The findings are in line with previous studies, which found no significant difference in immunogenicity or adverse events compared to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination alone. The study indicates that a single clinic visit can be more effective than two separate visits, especially for vulnerable populations like older people. Journal reference: Gonen, T. et al.

In recent years there have been increasing numbers of outbreaks in Europe, with many poultry flocks culled after being infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Continuous monitoring is crucial to enable timely implementation of control to prevent HPAI spread from wild birds to poultry and between poultry flocks within a country. We here utilize readily available public surveillance data and time-series models to predict HPAI detections within European countries and show a seasonal shift that happened during 2021–2022. The output is models capable of monitoring the weekly risk of HPAI outbreaks, to support decision making.

Some studies have found evidence of intercontinental spread of avian influenza virus (AIV) from Eurasia to Africa7 and North America8,9. Transmission from wild to domestic birds is a risk for many poultry farmers, especially regarding HPAI. However, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) can also be transmitted from wild birds to captive birds and poultry, and certain LPAI subtypes (H5 and H7) have the potential to mutate into HPAI in poultry10.In Europe, detections of LPAI and HPAI have been characterized by seasonal oscillations and an increased number of detections during the period November to May11. However, during the 2021 and 2022 seasons, detections were also observed during the summer months12,13. HPAI causes high mortality, approaching 100%14, and infected flocks are culled for welfare reasons and to prevent spread to other flocks15,16. Preventive actions to control avian influenza worldwide include reinforcement of biosecurity measures17, movement restrictions and vaccination13,18,19,20. Furthermore, biosecurity recommendations (such as indoor housing) are encouraged to prevent infection from wild birds21. These measures are enforced during periods with high risk of HPAI virus transmission and in restriction zones around affected farms22. Ideally, to predict high-risk periods and areas and to increase the effect of preventive measures, an early warning system should be developed and implemented.As wild birds cannot be contained in the same way as domestic birds during disease outbreaks, to prevent disease spread it is important to quickly detect AIV in wild bird species and mitigate potential transmission to domestic birds23. This can be done using early warning systems, although in the case of AIV challenges include the range of hosts and virus mutations23. Early warning systems can be applied to both wild and domestic bird species but are invariably dependent on surveillance data. AIV surveillance within poultry flocks can include the use of diagnostic testing schemes24, sentinel birds25, surveillance of flock mortality26 and morbidity and monitoring the daily feed and water intake and egg production27. Early warning systems for AIV in large areas (e.g., country level) can include active and passive surveillance of poultry flocks and wild birds6, environmental sampling28, complex systems such as hybrid knowledge-based algorithms29, and models based on movement data30,31. However, there is a need for systems that cover larger study areas beyond national boundaries, incorporate multiple wild- and domestic bird species and use real-time outbreak data. Thus, any system could benefit from the utilization of already available registered information on the occurrence of AIV in neighbouring countries, to predict the risk of transmission in specific countries.The World Organisation for Animal Health’s World Animal Health Information System (WOAH-WAHIS32) platform provides free access to world animal health data. The platform reports surveillance data from veterinary services in WOAH member and non-member countries and territories on WOAH-listed diseases in wildlife and domestic animals. The WAHIS database is publicly accessible and contains data as far back as 200532. Used in a statistical model, these data could facilitate the creation of an early warning system, when combined with a time-series modelling framework such as that proposed by Meyer et al.33. This modelling framework has previously been applied in human health modelling34,35,36,37, as well as modelling rabies in foxes38, Campylobacter in poultry39, and diseases in pigs40. Thus, this modelling framework has yet unexplored potential for use in modelling the risk of AIV transmission. In this study, we used registered WOAH-WAHIS data on HPAI in Europe to fit endemic-epidemic time-series models33, and evaluated the potential of such models based on accessible data as an early warning system. Our aim was to evaluate the use of WOAH-WAHIS data and the modelling framework to predict detections of HPAI virus on a weekly basis. The objective was to construct an early warning model which can inform decision makers of the risk of outbreaks for the purpose of timely implementation of preventive measures.Materials and methodsDataWe obtained data from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), where data are continuously made available32. As the data included all reported animal diseases, we used the definitions “High pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (poultry) (Inf. with)” and “Influenza A viruses of high pathogenicity (Inf. with) (non-poultry including wild birds)” to select only HPAI outbreaks and detections. Some of the reported events within these categories affected species other than birds and were thus excluded. For simplicity, we defined each data entry as outbreak detection (where outbreak detection includes both outbreaks in domestic birds and detections in wild birds), referring to one or more HPAI detections at the same locality at the same time. Thus, we did not distinguish between domestic and wild birds in our data. Although each entry in the WOAH-WAHIS data reported the number of affected birds, we chose to only model outbreak detections, because some countries (for example Denmark) will not sample and test all wild birds from the same area if it is a known outbreak area (and this could therefore greatly bias the data). Furthermore, domestic birds are usually affected in greater numbers than wild birds and this might skew outbreak severity patterns (if wild and domestic birds are modelled together).We restricted our analyses on European data to countries that reported HPAI detection data during the study period. We restricted our study region to Europe, and in order to focus on recent years to understand the resurgence of HPAI cases in Europe, and to avoid large temporal gaps in the HPAI data (for example, Denmark had no reported detections between 2006 and 2016), we restricted the study period to be from 1 January 2016 to 5 December 2022. European countries with no reports of HPAI between 2016 and 2022 (e.g., Andorra, Belarus, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City) were omitted from our analyses.We aggregated number of outbreak detections by week (n = 361) and country (n = 37), starting with week 1 in 2016 and ending with week 49 in 2022. For each country, if no outbreak detections were reported in a given week within the study period, we included this week as a “zero detection” observation.Due to the change in seasonal oscillations observed in Europe during 2021 and particularly 2022 compared to previous years12,13, we split our data and ran analyses using only data from 2016 to 2021 (week 1 in 2016 to week 52 in 2021), and models using only data from the last quarter of 2021 and all of 2022 (week 39 in 2021 to week 49 in 2022). We refer to these two data sets as HPAI1621 and HPAI2122. The two datasets overlap in time, as we wanted to include the latest HPAI season in the 2021–2022 dataset, but only keeping week 1–38 for 2021 in the HPAI1621 dataset caused model calibration problems, due to insufficient amount of detection data.We decided to aggregate the data to weekly HPAI detections, because aggregating over longer periods can mask causality and seasonality in the detections. However, the modelling framework described in this study can easily be adapted to aggregations over longer time periods, the data preparations just need to be adjusted accordingly. As a form of sensitivity analysis, we ran our statistical models with data aggregated bi-weekly, to assess whether the resulting models differed greatly from models with data aggregated weekly (see Sect. "Statistical analysis").Landscape variablesWild birds are natural reservoirs of AIV41, so we explored landscape variables that might be associated with presence of wild birds, i.e., coastal areas, waterways, and wetlands, where migratory birds are known to aggregate in high numbers42. For each country, we obtained the length of coastline (km) through the CIA World Factbook43 and used Global Lakes and Wetlands Database rasters44, 1 km2 resolution). We used R 4.1.245 package sp46,47 to calculate the area (km2) of waterways/wetlands within each country. We combined waterways and wetlands and used the following landcover definitions in the raster file to calculate the area within each country: “Lake”, “Reservoir”, “River”, “Freshwater Marsh, Floodplain”, “Coastal Wetland (incl. Mangrove, Estuary, Delta, Lagoon)”, “Pan, Brackish/Saline Wetland”, “Bog, Fen, Mire (Peatland)”, and “Intermittent Wetland/Lake”.Statistical analysisWe used the multivariate time-series modelling framework described by Meyer et al.33 to model the spatiotemporal relationship between HPAI detections. This modelling framework allows for additive decomposition of time series data into endemic and epidemic components. The HPAI data (outcome variable) was modelled as weekly counts conditional on past observations, following a negative binomial distribution, with the conditional mean decomposing into a random endemic part that incorporates a trend parameter, and an epidemic component composed of autoregressive effects (within-country effects) and neighbourhood effects (between-country effects). The epidemic component captures the occasional (to some extent local) detections while the endemic component explains the baseline rate of detections, usually with a temporal pattern. This endemic component translates, in our case, to the underlying risk of occurrence from factors not included in the model, i.e., transmission from migratory birds coming from countries not included in our study and unreported HPAI virus circulating within the countries included. The main formula for the conditional mean of the negative binomial distribution model is:$${\mu }_{it}={e}_{it}{\nu }_{it}+{\lambda }_{it}{Y}_{i,t-1 }+{\phi }_{it}\sum_{j\ne i}{w}_{ji}{Y}_{j, t-1}$$where \({\mu }_{it}\) is the conditional mean per country, i and time, t (week). The number of expected counts, eit, is modelled as an offset for the endemic log-linear predictor, νit. The epidemic component is observation-driven and contains a within-country effect (λ per country i at time t), and Y denotes the HPAI data, in country i at time t − 1. The between-country effects (ϕ, disease from other regions j) are captured by wji denoting the spatial weights matrix for the adjacency order of the different countries oji (See Supplementary Material for description of the adjacency matrix and Fig. S1) at time t-1. It is also possible to include data on infections originating from non-neighbouring countries by incorporating long-range transmission. This can be done by estimating the spatial weights wji as a power-law model with distance-decay, wij = \({o}_{ji}^{-d}\)33. Thus, the model incorporates an endemic transmission component (νit), an epidemic transmission component that splits into within-country transmission effects (λit), and between-country transmission effects (ϕit). All elements within the two components − νit, λit, and ϕit—allow for log-linear predictors as the above equation becomes a rich regression model. For more detailed description of the underlying modelling equations see Meyer et al.33, Held et al.48, and Paul and Held49.We used the same model selection process for both the HPAI1621 and HPAI2122 data sets, and Fig. 1 gives an overview of the different model comparisons and selection of final models. We used the package surveillance33,50 in R 4.1.245 to fit our models and explored several models with varying structure as described below and in Fig. 1. We divided both our HPAI1621 and HPAI2122 datasets into training sets (week 1 in 2016 to week 46 in 2021 and week 39 in 2021 to week 43 in 2022, respectively), and test sets (week 47 to week 52 in 2021 and week 44 to week 49 in 2022, respectively). We used the respective training data sets to train all our models and the test data sets to check model performance and to compare different model specifications. For both HPAI1621 and HPAI2122 datasets, we first specified a basic model (Baseline model 1 in Fig. 1) with no covariates and no seasonality but with country area relative to all countries (area_frac) as offset in the endemic component and simple epidemic between-country effects (only disease transmission from countries directly sharing a border, wji = 1(j ∼ i) = 1(oji = 1)):Figure 1An overview of the different model comparisons and different baseline models used for selecting the final multivariate highly pathogenic avian influenza virus time-series models for the HPAI1621 and HPAI2122 data. Within-country/between-country effects denote that covariates/offsets/seasonality/power law was only included in the within-country/between-country effects of the epidemic component. All models included country area relative to all the country areas as offset in the endemic component.Full size image$${\mu }_{it}={area\_frac}_{i}{\nu }_{i}+\lambda {Y}_{i,t-1 }+\phi \sum_{j\ne i}{w}_{ji}{Y}_{j, t-1},$$In this basic model, we assumed that both the endemic and epidemic parameters were homogeneous across countries and constant over time, ν = exp(α(ν)), λ = exp(α(λ)) and ϕ = exp(α(ϕ)). For the epidemic components, we used an offset of 1 and for all fixed-effects models, we used the default quasi-Newton penalisation for log-likelihood to maximize the marginal likelihood regarding the variance parameters37. We then compared the basic models to other models incorporating 1, 2 and 3 seasonal waves in both the endemic and epidemic components. We chose only to add seasonal waves to the within-country effects in the epidemic components (and not to the between-country effects) to keep model complexity as simple as possible (model equations below depict 3 seasonal waves (s)):$${\mathrm{log}(\nu }_{it})={\alpha }^{\left(\nu \right)}+{\sum }_{s=3}^{s}\left\{{\gamma }_{s}^{(\nu )}\mathrm{sin}\left({\omega }_{s}t\right)+ {\delta }_{s}^{(\nu )}\mathrm{cos}({\omega }_{s}t)\right\}, {\omega }_{1}=\frac{2\pi }{52},{\omega }_{2}=\frac{4\pi }{52}, {\omega }_{3}=\frac{6\pi }{52}$$$${\mathrm{log}(\lambda }_{it})={\alpha }^{\left(\lambda \right)}+{\sum }_{s=3}^{s}\left\{{\gamma }_{s}^{(\lambda )}\mathrm{sin}\left({\omega }_{s}t\right)+ {\delta }_{s}^{(\lambda )}\mathrm{cos}({\omega }_{s}t)\right\}, {\omega }_{1}=\frac{2\pi }{52},{\omega }_{2}=\frac{4\pi }{52}, {\omega }_{3}=\frac{6\pi }{52}$$As recommended by Paul and Held49, we used strictly proper scoring rules when comparing and validating models. We specifically used the ranked probability score (RPS) and the logarithmic score (logS), and the scores were based on successive one-step-ahead predictions (one-week-ahead forecasts) for the models using the test sets (previously unseen by the models), where we refitted the models up to week t to obtain predictions for week t + 1. Strictly proper scoring rules provide summary measures by evaluating probabilistic forecasts based on the predictive distribution and the actual count data51. The most commonly used strictly proper scoring rules are the logS score and RPS. LogS (calculated as minus the log of the probability estimate for the actual outcome) is highly sensitive to extreme values, as it penalizes low probability events. In contrast RPS generalizes the absolute error and thus measures how well probabilistic forecasts match the observed outcome49,52. RPS is less sensitive to extreme values and adds weights to unusually high observed or predicted counts49,52. When comparing logS and RPS for different models, we calculate mean scores over a set of predictions. Assessment can be done by simply ordering the mean scores or using permutation tests to test for significant differences49. If RPS and logS differed in scoring the best model, we chose to use logS as it is more sensitive to a misprediction in an outbreak period than RPS. For both RPS and logS, a lower score indicates a better mode49. We used permutation tests for paired data to test for differences between mean model scores of the two models with the lowest scores49 (Fig. 1). The best performing models were then selected as the new baseline models (Fig. 1). We checked if all models were well-calibrated by using a calibration test to assess whether the predictive distribution covered the observed value52, and only well-calibrated models were considered when selecting the best performing models. After selecting the best models comparing seasonal waves, we used these as new baseline models (Baseline model 2 in Fig. 1) and added area of waterways/wetlands and length of coastline as log-transformed covariates (τ(ν)(log(coast + 1) + log(wetlands + 1)), τ(λ) (log(coast + 1) + log(wetlands + 1)) or offsets (multiplying log(coast + 1) + log(wetlands + 1) with νi and/or λit) to the endemic and epidemic components (only for the epidemic within-country effects as these covariates were country-specific) and compared and validated these models to the new baseline models, resulting in selection of another new baseline model for each of the HPAI1621 and HPAI2122 data sets (Baseline model 3 in Fig. 1). Lastly, we compared the latest new baseline models to models with spatial weights as a power-law model with distance-decay, wij = \({o}_{ji}^{-d}\) and to models with country-specific (both uncorrelated and correlated) random effects, \({\alpha }_{i}^{(\nu )}\sim N({\alpha }^{(\nu )},{\sigma }_{\nu }^{2})\), \({\alpha }_{i}^{(\lambda )}\sim N({\alpha }^{(\lambda )},{\sigma }_{\lambda }^{2})\), \({\alpha }_{i}^{(\phi )}\sim N({\alpha }^{(\phi )},{\sigma }_{\phi }^{2})\) (assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and positive definitive covariance matrix) to capture any remaining heterogeneity not explained by covariates or seasonal waves (for example due to underreporting of outbreaks in certain countries). These random effects were applied to both the endemic and epidemic components of the models (in the latter both for within- and between-country effects), to absorb effects such as country-specific likelihood of detection and occurrence unrelated to landscape factors. As with previous model comparisons, we checked for model calibration and used RPS and logS to select the final best models for forecasting. For models including random effects, we used the Nelder-Mead penalisation for log-likelihood to maximize the marginal likelihood regarding the variance parameters49. We used the final best models to run 500 simulations of long-term forecasts to gauge the overall ability of the models to simulate HPAI detections. For the HPAI1621 dataset, we simulated the years 2020–2021 (week 1 in 2020 to week 52 in 2021), whereas for the HPAI2122 dataset we simulated week 40 in 2021 to week 49 in 2022. Forecasting consists of sequential calls to the negative binomial distributions developed in the final models. At each time point (here week number), the mean is determined by using the parameter estimates and the counts simulated at the previous time point. For example, for the first week in 2020 (HPAI1621 dataset), we needed parameter estimates and counts simulated before 2020 and we specified the initial vector of counts used for this forecast as the last week of 2019. For the HPAI2122 models, we used week 39 in 2021.As a sensitivity analysis, to test if our model results were sensitive to the timescale of our data, we ran models using the HPAI1621 dataset aggregated bi-weekly and compared the final resulting model, its variables, offsets, and coefficients to the final model based on data aggregated weekly. We used the same methods as described above.ResultsDataThe data obtained from WOAH-WAHIS32 contained 15,595 European HPAI detections during 361 weeks from 37 countries (including Faroe Islands, see Table 1) that reported HPAI data between 1 January 2016 and 5 December 2022. Of these, 8873 were detections in wild birds, whereas 6722 were detections in domestic birds. Table 1 gives a detailed overview of the countries included in our study, the number of wild and domestic detections and the HPAI subtypes reported for each country between 2016 and 2022. Supplementary Table S1 shows the reported detections by subtype and the number of countries that detected the specific subtypes.Table 1 The 37 European countries included in this study, number of detections in wild and domestic birds, highly pathogenic avian influenza subtypes, and number of weeks with and without reported outbreaks for each country between 2016 and 2022 (1 January 2016, to 5 December 2022).Full size tableDue to few records of H7 cases, we decided to only use H5 subtypes in our study and removed 46 entries (including 43 entries where subtype was not specified, Supplementary Table S1). This produced a dataset containing 15,549 detections. Due to data constraints, we combined the different H5 subtypes in our analyses (where 60.8% of the detections were H5N1 and 35.7% were H5N8, Supplementary Table S1). Considering H5 subtypes only, France, Germany and the UK were among the countries with the highest number of detections, followed by Hungary, Poland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Denmark. However, when correcting for country size, the highest number of detections per 10,000 km2 were found in the Netherlands, followed by Denmark, the UK, Hungary, Germany, Belgium, and France (Fig. 2A). Overall, detections were predominantly reported in the autumn and spring, and large epidemic waves were observed in 2016/2017, 2020, 2021 and 2022 (Fig. 2B), with similar patterns for both wild and domestic birds (Supplementary Fig. S2).Figure 2Number of reported highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5 subtype) detections between 2016 and 2022 summed over 37 European countries (including Faroe Islands) shown (A) geographically as numbers per 10,000 km2, and (B) over time. The dataset contained a total of 15,549 detections of varying sizes in both wild and domestic birds. The map in A) was created using the package tmap64 in R 4.1.245.Full size imageDue to changes in the seasonality of the detections observed in 2021 and particularly in 2022 (Fig. 2B)12,13, we created two datasets from our data, before analysing and modelling spatiotemporal relationships. The first data set, hereafter referred to as HPAI1621, contained data from 2016 to 2021 (week 1 in 2016 to week 52 in 2021, comprising 9100 detections in total), and the second data set, hereafter referred to as HPAI2122, contained data from 2021–2022 (week 39 in 2021 to week 49 in 2022, comprising 9376 detections in total). We included week 39–52 in 2021 in the HPAI1621 data set due to data constraints, thus the two datasets overlap in time. In the 2016–2021 data set, 33.6% of the detections were of the subtype H5N1 and 61.2% were of the subtype H5N8, whereas these proportions were 99.2% and 0.2% for the 2021–2022 data set (Supplementary Table S2).Endemic-epidemic time-series modelTesting multiple model formulations, we found that when comparing the baseline model with no seasonality (Baseline model 1 in Fig. 1) to models with one, two and three seasonal waves in both the endemic and epidemic (within-country effects) components, the best performing calibrated model for the HPAI1621 data (with the lowest scores for RPS and logS) was the model with three waves in the endemic component and one wave in the within-country effects in the epidemic component, and thus this model was chosen as the new baseline model (Base line model 2, Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S3). For the HPAI2122 data, 2 calibrated models had the exact same low logS score and included no seasonality in the endemic component and 2 and 3 waves in the within-country effects in the epidemic component respectively. We chose the simpler model with 2 waves in the within-country effects in the epidemic component as the new baseline model for HPAI2122 (Baseline model 2, Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S3). For HPAI1621, all models had calibration tests for RPS with p ≥ 0.05, indicating satisfactory calibration; however, for logS, not all models calibrated (p < 0.05, Supplementary Table S3). For the HPAI2122 data, only models with no endemic waves were calibrated (p ≥ 0.05), which was also the case for logS, except for one model including three waves in the endemic component and no waves in the epidemic component (p ≥ 0.05, Supplementary Table S3). Comparing the new baseline models (Baseline model 2 in Fig. 1) to models in which we added area of waterways/wetlands and length of coastline as log-transformed covariates or offsets, the calibrated model with the lowest scores for both RPS and logS was a model with covariates in the endemic component and no covariates or offsets in the epidemic components for the HPAI1621 data; this was chosen as the new baseline model (Baseline model 3 in Fig. 1). For the HPAI2122 data, the best performing calibrated model based on logS scores included no covariates or offsets in either component (Supplementary Table S3). This model was chosen as the new baseline model for HPAI2122 (Baseline model 3 in Fig. 1). Most of the HPAI1621 models calibrated based on RPS scores but not logS scores, particularly not models incorporating the covariates as offsets (p < 0.05, Supplementary Table S3). For HPAI2122 most of the models calibrated based on RPS scores, except for models with offsets in the endemic component. For logS, all models calibrated (p ≥ 0.05).Adding spatial weights wji as a power-law model with distance-decay and models with country-specific correlated and uncorrelated random effects to the new baseline model (Baseline model 3 in Fig. 1) resulted in a best performing calibrated model that included the spatial weights power law and uncorrelated random effects for both the HPAI161 and HPAI2122 data sets (Supplementary Table S3). For both RPS and logS, most models for the HPAI1621 data calibrated (p ≥ 0.05), except for models without power law added to the spatial weights for logS (p < 0.05); the model with power law added, but no random effects; and the model with only correlated random effects and no power law added for RPS (p < 0.05). For the HPAI2122 dataset, only the models with no power law added and random elements did not calibrate for RPS scores (p < 0.05), whereas all models according to logS scores calibrated.The final models for HPAI1621 and HPAI2122 both included power law and uncorrelated random effects. The HPAI1621 model included three seasonal waves in the endemic component and one wave in the within-country effect in the epidemic component as well as covariates in the endemic component, whereas the HPAI2122 model only included epidemic seasonality. The seasonality waves for both the endemic (3 waves) and epidemic component (2 waves) for the HPAI1621 model and the epidemic seasonality waves (2 waves) for the HPAI2122 model can be seen in the Supplementary Fig. S3. There are large peaks in AIV predictions during the autumn and smaller peaks during spring (Supplementary Fig. S3); but in the endemic component, there is a small peak in early summer for the endemic seasonality in the HPAI1621 model. For the within-country epidemic seasonality, we see large peaks in autumn and spring for the HPAI1621 model, but a large peak starting earlier during the summer season for the HPAI2122 model. We also see a very small, almost negligible, peak in the early spring. Epidemic between-country predicted transmission was mostly seen in Czechia, Sweden, and Poland in 2016–2021 (Fig. 3), compared to 2021–2022 where it was mostly in Poland, Belgium, and the Netherlands (Fig. 4).Figure 3Country-wise model fit, and the relative contribution of model components based on the final multivariate time-series models for the HPAI1621 data. Dots show the actual counts of reported highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5 subtype) detections in domestic and wild birds. Only countries with > 200 detections are depicted. The last panel shows the overall model fit aggregated over all the 37 countries. Note that the scales on the Y-axes are different for some of the graphs, and zero/missing detections have been omitted. Although actual counts from week 47–52 in 2021 are depicted, they were not part of the training set in the model, and thus are not part of the model fit.Full size imageFigure 4Country-wise model fit, and the relative contribution of model components based on the final multivariate time-series models for the HPAI2122 data.

The last panel shows the overall model fit aggregated over all the 37 countries. Note that the scales on the Y-axes are different for some of the graphs, and zero/missing detections have been omitted. Although actual counts from week 44–49 in 2022 are depicted, they were not part of the training set in the model, and thus are not part of the model fit.Full size imageThe point estimates of the final HPAI1621 model show that length of coastline has a positive association with detections in the endemic component, whereas area of wetlands has a negative association (Table 2). However, the confidence intervals for these coefficients overlap zero (Table 2). Our final model for HPAI1621 suggests that most of the HPAI detections reported in Europe are epidemic (occasional localized outbreaks) in nature (94.6%), with 78.8% within-country and 15.8% between-country transmission; 5.4% of the reported detections were endemic (baseline rate comprising unreported outbreaks within a country and outbreaks originating from transmission from countries not included in our study) in nature. Compared to the HPAI1621 model, the model for HPAI2122 suggested that more HPAI detections were endemic in nature (12.2%), with 87.8% being epidemic in nature (73.3% within-country and 14.5% between-country transmission). The prediction plots show that there is a slight tendency for our final models to underestimate the number of detections in periods with many detections (Figs. 3 and 4).Table 2 Coefficient estimates from the final multivariate time-series models for HPAI1621 and HPAI2122.Full size tableIn the HPAI1621 model, the exponentially transformed deviations of the random intercepts, indicating the model fit for each country, show that for the epidemic within-country random intercepts, particularly France, Switzerland, Hungary, and Germany (Supplementary Fig. S4A, pink colour) had more detections from within-country transmission than explained by the model. For the HPAI2122 model, countries with the largest random epidemic, within-country intercepts were France and Slovenia, followed by the UK, Italy, Hungary, and Spain (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Maps of the random intercepts for epidemic between-country transmission show that for the HPAI1621 model, countries such as the UK, Estonia, Sweden, and Bulgaria followed by Hungary received more cases from other countries than the model could explain (Supplementary Fig. S4A), whereas for the HPAI2122 model the highest random intercepts were found for the Netherlands, Hungary, France, and Poland (Supplementary Fig. S4B). As for the map of the endemic random intercepts, reflecting endemic circulation and transmission by migratory birds from countries not included in this study, countries in cyan in Supplementary Fig. S4A and B exhibit a relatively lower endemic incidence than the model predicted.Fan plots show how well the final models performed for successive one-step-ahead predictions (one-week-ahead) using the test data sets (unseen data). We see that both models predict detections reasonably well, but there seems to be a lag of one week for some detection peaks (Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6). Comparing the final models to the original baseline model 1, shows how the overall predictions from the final HPAI1621 model encompass slightly more of the actual observed detections than the overall predictions from baseline model 1 (Supplementary Fig. S7). Furthermore, the HPAI2122 final model seems to predict more detections to be epidemic between-country and endemic in nature compared to Baseline model 1 (Supplementary Fig. S8).Using the final HPAI1621 model to make long-term forecasts from 2020 to 2021, Fig. 5A shows how the model predicted many detections in the period late 2020/early 2021 and late 2021 where a large number of detections were reported. However, it did not capture well the observed peak in detection in the spring 2020, following a period with low numbers of observed detections (early 2020). This indicates that the model forecasts relatively well in years with many detections, but less well in years following years with no or low observed detections. The mean size of all the simulated detections (N = 5925) was slightly smaller than the observed number of detections (N = 6593) from 2020–2021. The same pattern was seen for individual countries (Supplementary Fig. S9). For the HPAI2122 model, forecasting the years 2021–2022 resulted in continuous predicted detections throughout the period, which corresponds to observed number of predictions. The model showed two peaks in late 2021/early 2022 and again in late 2022, and whereas the model predicted the increase in 2021/2022 detections fairly well, it overshot predictions in late 2022 (Fig. 5B). For individual countries we see the same patterns (Supplementary Fig. S10). For the HPAI2122 model, the mean size of simulated detections (N = 11,710) was larger than the actual number of detections during 2021–2022 (N = 9367).Figure 5Simulation-based long-term forecast for (A) the HPAI1621 final model starting from the last week in 2019 (left-hand dot), and (B) the HPAI2122 final model starting from week 39 in 2021. The plots show weekly number of predicted and observed highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5 subtype) detections aggregated over all countries. The fan charts represent the 1% and 99% quantiles of the simulations (N = 500) each week; their mean is displayed as a white line. Actual reported number of detections are depicted with open circles. Data from week 47 to week 52 in 2021 for the HPAI1621 model and week 44–49 in 2022 in the HPAI2122 model were not used to train the models.Full size imageAggregating the data from 2016 to 2021 bi-weekly and following the same model selection process as above resulted in a final model very similar to the original weekly aggregated HPAI1621 model, however with 2 seasonal waves in the endemic component and three seasonal waves in the epidemic component, covariates in both the endemic and epidemic components, spatial weights power law and uncorrelated random effects (Supplementary Tables S4 and S4 and Fig. S11).DiscussionWe here utilized a time-series modelling framework to predict country level detection of H5 HPAI based on freely available WOAH-WAHIS HPAI data. This enables the greatest use of data from other, surrounding countries for continuous risk assessment, taking endemic and epidemic transmission into account. Furthermore, we identified a difference between the model fitted to 2016–2021 data and the model fitted to 2021–2022 data: in the latter the seasonal component was weaker, reflecting a concerning change towards reduced seasonality in occurrence of HPAI.Overall model fits showed a fair congruence with the reported data for all countries over time (Figs. 3 and 4). The final models encompassed more of the observed detections compared to the original baseline models, particularly for the HPAI1621 model, so that adding covariates (for HPAI1621 only), long-range transmission and random effects improved the model fit. Even though the endemic detections became more frequent in the model fitted to 2021–2022 data compared to the model fitted to 2016–2021 data, the final models generally predicted fewer endemic than epidemic detections; this could be due to more detections being explained by the epidemic long-distance transmission and/or epidemic random effects. The final model fits showed that the model framework is sufficiently flexible to predict detections in countries with large temporal variation in the number of HPAI detections (Figs. 3 and 4). When used for predicting the number of detections in the following week, the models were reactive to the reported data from each country; they can miss the start of periods with many sudden detections, such as in France and Hungary, but then the probability estimates were adjusted to the new level based on the previous week´s detection data, which is a common property of one-step ahead forecasting33 (Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6). During prolonged periods with detections, the models appeared to predict the overall risk well, even when there was a declining trend (e.g., Germany and Denmark, Figs. 3 and 4). Further studies with more, diverse data are needed to investigate these properties of the model.A change in the seasonality of HPAI in Europe has been suspected as detections have been observed during the summer months in 2021 and particularly in 2022, in contrast to previous years12,13. Creating separate models for 2016–2021 and 2021–2022 produced models with different seasonality, particularly in the endemic component. According to the HPAI1621 final model, the 2016–2021 detection data were best described by a model with three seasonal waves in the endemic component and one seasonal wave in the epidemic component (HPAI1621 model). The model for 2021–2022 (HPAI2122) included no seasonality in the endemic component (and no covariates), instead assuming a more or less constant endemic contribution to predicted detections. The HPAI2122 model furthermore included two seasonal waves in the within-country effects of the epidemic component. The final HPAI1621 model generally predicted a higher probability of detections during the winter months but did not predict well for early 2020 following a period with a low number of recorded detections. However, in years in which detections were common (e.g., winter 2020/2021 and last quarter of 2021), the model captured the increased magnitude of detections. The same outcome was found for individual countries. The model incorporates a strong seasonality effect, captured by the seasonal waves in the final model. The epidemic seasonal wave likely reflects HPAI transmission from migratory birds from countries within our study, and thus the one wave in the final model may reflect the timing of the main bird migration periods within countries (winter/spring). The endemic component, represented by three waves in the final model, might indicate that more bird species or migration events are involved in long-distance transmission (from countries not included in this study), and likely captures transmission related to wild bird behaviour (e.g., contact during mating season or communal roosts during winter) combined with the seasonal survival rate of the virus in the environment. Further studies should investigate if these wave patterns differ between countries, reflecting differences in migratory bird species, local bird behaviour or potentially farm-to-farm transmission. The seasonal component in the model reflects the general conditions for HPAI to occur, which between 2016 and 2021 were strongly seasonal in Europe. The final HPAI2122 model predicted continuous detections throughout late 2021 and all of 2022. The model generally predicted well for the 2021/2022 winter season and throughout the summer but predicted more detections than observed in the autumn of 2022. The endemic component included no seasonality, and thus the model assumed a constant contribution from the endemic component. Thus, any seasonality seen in the model predictions were due to the two seasonal waves in the within-country effects of the epidemic component. As with the HPAI1621 model, this epidemic seasonality could be due to HPAI transmission from migratory birds from countries within our study or due to general bird behaviour. The lack of seasonality of the endemic component could also be due to this component not solely being related to migratory events, indicating that detections were observed throughout the year. Countries such as France, Germany, UK, and Denmark have had outbreaks of HPAI in domestic poultry and ducks during the summer months53. Some of these outbreaks, particularly in France and Hungary, were caused by between-farm spread and thus not related to migratory birds53. Thus, these models, and perhaps particularly the HPAI2122 model, are useful for assessing the general risk and timing of HPAI occurrence within individual countries on a weekly basis. However, it should be kept in mind that the occurrence of HPAI also relies on stochastic events such as bird migration timing, which is heavily influenced by the weather54. Seeing as how the seasonality of HPAI detections have changed since 2016, it is important to continuously update the models to reflect the current situation and seasonality. Extrapolation of this modelling framework to other continents is an area of research that could be pursued if appropriate surveillance data are available.Geographically, the models both over- and underestimated HPAI detections within countries. Underestimation (RI > 1) was most pronounced for Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, and France for the HPAI1621 model and for France, the UK, Spain, Italy, Slovenia, and Hungary for the HPAI2122 model, in which more detections attributed to within-country transmission were observed (Supplementary Fig. S4). Overestimation (RI < 1) of detections attributed to within-country transmission mostly occurred in countries located at the edge of the study area, e.g., Norway, Finland, and Ukraine for both the HPAI1621 and HPAI2122 models. This could indicate that for countries with missing information on detections in some of their neighbouring countries, the epidemic within-country estimates capture more detections than for other countries with neighbour data i.e., an edge effect. This also means that the model will not incorporate, nor predict, the magnitude of outbreaks where more birds have been affected than those reported to WOAH-WAHIS. The HPAI1621 model underestimated (R < 1) the between-country transmission in countries such as UK, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Hungary, and Bulgaria whereas for the HPAI2122 model, this was especially seen for the Netherlands, Hungary, France, and Poland. Most of these countries have a considerable length of coastline, which might attract migratory birds from areas other than the directly neighbouring countries (but still only the countries included in this study). This could possibly create noise in the estimated between-country effect. The endemic component here reflects all transmission not explained by within- and between-country spread, e.g., transmission from unreported outbreaks within each country or from migratory birds from countries not included in this study. For a large number of countries, the endemic component underestimated (R > 1) the number of detections, particularly for the HPAI2122 model (Supplementary Fig. S4). This could be due to underreporting, or reflects that for these countries, the model attributes more detections to surrounding countries (for which this information exists in the data), reducing the estimated effect of migratory bird transmission. Many of the countries where the endemic component underestimated the number of detections lie on several bird migratory flyways with many different migrating birds of different origins55,56,57. Adding data on bird migration routes as covariates in our model could potentially improve the predictive power, but such data might be difficult to obtain and manage.We found that including the covariates length of coastline and area of waterways/wetlands improved the HPAI1621 model, indicating an association between detection of HPAI virus and these covariates. However, the point estimates for both these covariates overlap zero, so the effect is statistically non-significant. Several other studies have found an effect of landscape on AIV occurrence in wild and domestic birds. In a previous study in Denmark, using mixed model generalized linear models, Kjær et al.6 found an association between distance to coast and distance to wetlands and AIV in wild birds collected through passive surveillance. In Romania, Ward et al.58,59 found a relationship between HPAI outbreaks and distance to migratory waterfowl sites, distance to major roads and distance to rivers or streams using conditional logistic regression models and spatial lag regression models. Using a machine learning (ML) approach, Belkhiria et al.42 found that land cover and distance to coast were important when predicting risk areas for AIV in wild birds in California. On a large scale, Walsh et al.60 used data on HPAI occurrence reported to the WOAH (as we did in the present study) in addition to spatial surface water data and domestic bird density data. They analysed the data using machine learning algorithms and found a spatio-temporal pattern of HPAI occurrence in domestic poultry throughout the world. On a smaller scale, Schreuder et al.61 used a machine learning algorithm and data on wild bird densities and landscape variables to spatially predict HPAI in the Netherlands with high accuracy. Pereira et al.62 used a fireworks-like surveillance approach to fit a model to WOAH-WAHIS data for HPAI H5N1. This model was able to describe the data well but did not include a component to account for detections not reported to the WOAH within or outside the study area.The model framework used here has some limitations for the purpose of modelling AIV. Firstly, the data do not account for differences in detection effort, sampling scheme or prevention measures in the different countries reporting detections. Incorporating such information into this modelling framework could potentially improve our models, although it can be complicated to compare and categorize surveillance systems between countries and time periods. Secondly by combining HPAI detections in both domestic and wild birds, the models assume that HPAI can spread from wild to domestic birds and vice versa. This may not be the case, mainly due to farm biosecurity practices but also due to infected domestic birds usually being culled and thus not able to transmit HPAI to their surroundings. We did first attempt to run separate models for domestic and wild birds, but data constraints caused the models to not to calibrate. The seasonal detection patterns in Fig. S2 (Supplementary Material) suggest that combining the data is warranted, as domestic and wild birds exhibit similar seasonal patterns. Thus, we hypothesize that the general transmission in an area is in most cases high when there is a spill over to domestic birds, and an infected poultry flock reflects transmission in the wild bird population, which can transmit to areas in the same country as well as other countries. Also, when included in the model components, the models assume a constant contribution from seasonality every year; for example, there is a probability of detection in winter even in years without any detections. This seasonality effect might change over time as we have seen in the HPAI2122 model, for instance due to climate change (as climate has an impact on bird migration and the timing thereof), and the circulating HPAI strains (likely with different properties and target species) can change over time; therefore, model fit might be reduced if it is fitted to a long period of data. Ideally, a model should be able to incorporate a trend over time so that seasonality changes and other changes related to climate can be captured. Furthermore, we did not differentiate between different H5 HPAI viruses, due to data constraints. However, different AIV strains may have different transmission potentials63, affect different species and thus have different transmission patterns. The 2016–2021 detection data consisted mainly of H5N8, whereas the 2021–2022 detection data consisted mainly of H5N1. In addition, more than 20 genotypes have been detected in Europe since 2016, which could explain some of the differences between the models. If more data becomes available in the future, it could be feasible to apply our models on specific subtypes and genotypes separately. This could potentially improve the predictive ability and the separation into the endemic and epidemic components of the modelling framework. Furthermore, detections of one strain in an area are logically not directly related to other strains in other areas (as in having been transmitted between the areas). However, within each season, detections in the countries included in this study have up until December 2022 been dominated by the same few subtypes in all countries. Another limitation is that the models cannot account for differences in reporting effort, which likely differs between countries and changes over time. However, this remains a challenge for all model types, and cannot easily be separated from the general level of occurrence within each country. Both models estimated that the vast majority of detections were epidemic in nature and could be explained by either within-country or between-country transmission. This shows that the models explained the majority of detections based on previous within-country transmission, with a contribution from between-country transmission. However, whereas only 5.4% of the detections were attributed to endemic (unexplained) transmission in the HPAI1621 model, this percentage was 12.2% in the HPAI2122 model. This suggests that the HPAI2122 model estimates rely more on unreported endemic HPAI virus circulating within the countries, and transmission from migratory birds coming from countries not included in our study. An explanation for this could be that the increased outbreaks during summer make it difficult for people to see the dead birds, due to foliage e.g., in forests. It could also reflect increased decomposition of carcasses at warmer temperatures, or increased activity in scavenger species, quickly removing carcasses and thereby reducing the detection. It could furthermore be that increasing numbers of outbreaks makes passive surveillance less sensitive as people may stop reporting when finding dead birds is no longer unusual. Furthermore, the model selection could have an impact on the resulting final model. We here chose to test seasonality as a starting point, but model selection could be sensitive to the order of variables included. This should be explored in future studies. Lastly, selection of training and test data for each of the data sets could impact model results, however, with these kinds of models it is a trade-off between having enough data to calibrate the models and using up-to-date data that captures recent changes in the detection patterns. The epidemiology of avian influenza has always been dynamic, and during the past few years we have seen an even more dynamic system than expected. Predicting such a dynamic system is challenging, and what we present here is one approach to this challenge.Despite the challenges highlighted, these models represent a practical approach to modelling the risk of AIV occurrence, since there are many potential variables in the system for which we do not have information. Despite such challenges, this model finds use for informing policy makers about the HPAI spatiotemporal risk, using readily available surveillance data. In future research, more layers could be added to the model including the actual bird density, species composition and temperature related to bird behaviour and thus transmission.ConclusionThe model framework was able to use surveillance data on HPAI detections in European countries and could be useful for predicting the probability and timing of detections. Separating our data into the years 2016–2021 and 2021–2022 revealed a seasonal shift in observed and predicted detections in Europe. HPAI detections were mostly explained by within-country transmission, but with a considerable contribution from other countries. The model based on 2021–2022 data attributed more detections to endemic transmission than the model based on 2016–2021 data. A strong seasonal component reflected the large temporal variation. This modelling framework can be used as a decision support tool to predict periods with higher risk of HPAI within a country.

Published September 13, 2023 All Meta Credits Stephen Schramm Working@Duke Senior Writer Tags HR Staff Covid Employee Wellness With the start of fall approaching, so too does the season when it’s more likely you will catch the seasonal flu. And this year, there’s another reason for concern as COVID strains continue to be a threat with a late summer spike in cases. Influenza activity usually begins in October, peaks between December and February, and can continue until May, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Meanwhile, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS), reports that hospital and emergency room visits due to COVID, as well as the detection of COVID in wastewater tests, have been steadily increasing in North Carolina since July, now hitting levels not seen since last winter. Find Your Flu VaccinationStaff and faculty can get vaccinated at several sites at Duke this fall.See the schedule Hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID are also on the rise nationally. To date, 1.1 million COVID-19 deaths have been reported in the U.S. Working@Duke talked with Duke’s Employee Occupational Health & Wellness Executive Director Dr. Carol Epling and Duke Professor of Medicine Dr. Cameron Wolfe, an infectious disease expert, about seasonal influenza, COVID-19, and boosters. WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH COVID? Wolfe said the current rise in COVID-19 cases is expected. Summer travel, more gatherings and relaxed restrictions have likely contributed to the late summer increase in infections, emergency department visits and hospital admissions. Also, the virus itself is continuing to evolve, Wolfe said. Mutations lead to newer – sometimes more contagious – strains, such as the current BA.2.86 variant, which can lead to an increase in COVID-19 cases. “For a number of different reasons, it seems there are repeated spikes, which tend to happen toward the end of July and into August, and then again in the winter,” Wolfe said. “We’ve seen the summer spikes for the last four summers in a row, sadly. It’s a healthy reminder that the virus is still out there.” WHAT CAN WE DO TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM COVID-19? Expect a new COVID-19 booster to be released this fall to combat newer strains of the virus. Photo courtesy of University Communications. Nearly halfway through the fourth year of living with COVID-19, the conventional wisdom for avoiding the virus still holds. If you have symptoms, it’s important to get tested, isolate and wear a mask. Another key step Wolfe recommends is getting the updated new COVID-19 booster, which will likely be available in late September or early October. The new booster will be formulated to protect against newer strains of the virus and, if taken in the fall, will provide strengthened immunity during the winter months when the risk of contracting respiratory diseases are highest. “I think the reality of this moment is that COVID continues to mutate and cause older adults and immunosuppressed adults a lot of problems,” Wolfe said. “Even for healthy adults, I think we all know people who have been knocked down by the virus in the past month or so. So there’s good motivation to get the updated vaccine. People should view this new vaccine like a flu shot which enables them to stay healthy. Nobody wants to go through a bunch of days feeling sick; no one wants to get Long Covid. They can avoid that with a 30-minute trip to a pharmacy. It’s that simple. The virus is here to stay. We need to do what we can to control it.” Due to the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, which helped fund Duke’s COVID-19 vaccination and booster efforts for the campus community, staff and faculty will need to get the updated vaccine through pharmacies or their health care provider. COVID-19 boosters are covered in full, with no co-pay, under all of Duke’s employee medical plans. With the approval of the updated formula, the bivalent vaccine introduced last year is no longer approved by the FDA for emergency use. Duke and other healthcare providers have discontinued administration of the bivalent vaccine until they receive the updated formula, which should be within the next couple weeks. WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I FEEL SICK? The symptoms for COVID-19 and seasonal influenza are similar and include runny nose, scratchy throat, cough, headache, fatigue and fever. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should isolate, wear a mask, and seek out a COVID-19 test. Employees who are experiencing symptoms or would like to report an exposure should visit My COVID Link to report and self-schedule an appointment for testing. This link should also be used to report a positive home or outside COVID-19 test. Staff and faculty may also contact the Duke EOHW Exposure Hotline to report symptoms or seek guidance, by calling 919-385-0429 (choose option 1) from 8 a.m.-5p.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m.-noon on weekends. According to Epling, wearing a mask is an especially important step in slowing the spread of both COVID-19 and influenza. Anyone experiencing symptoms should wear a mask whenever they’re around others. “Just put your mask on,” Epling said. “Even if you test negative for COVID, you can help prevent the spread of all of the viruses that are causing respiratory conditions. Sometimes tests can be falsely negative when you actually have COVID. Or you can have some other virus. But masking will help us all.” HOW TO GET A SEASONAL FLU VACCINATION: Getting an influenza vaccination is a crucial step toward protecting yourself and those around you during flu season. Photo courtesy of University Communications. Getting an influenza vaccination remains an essential step in keeping you and your loved ones safe during the months when the flu virus – which the CDC estimates killed between 19,000 to 58,000 Americans during the 2022-23 flu season – is especially active. EOHW will offer no-cost flu vaccinations at clinics at Duke Regional Hospital, Duke Raleigh Hospital and at the main EOHW location in the Orange Zone subbasement of Duke Clinics. There will also be pop-up locations around campus beginning in late September. From Oct. 1 to Oct. 4, an influenza vaccination clinic for employees will take place at the Karsh Alumni and Visitors Center, 2080 Duke University Rd. See the schedule for other dates and locations. The quadrivalent vaccine, which protects against several strains of the flu will be administered at pop-up vaccination sites. High dose vaccinations for people 65 and older and egg-free options are available at EOHW clinics. Influenza vaccinations are a condition of employment for Duke University Health System, the Duke University School of Medicine and the Duke University School of Nursing. The deadline to show proof of vaccination or receive an approved exemption is 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 7. Vaccinations are strongly recommended for Duke University students, staff and faculty. “By getting vaccinated against the flu, you’re protecting yourself from severe illness, but you’re also protecting the people close to you,” Epling said. “You can be infectious the day before your symptoms ever start. So you can transmit the flu to others before you know you have it, which can be devastating to another person.” Send story ideas, shout-outs and photographs through our story idea form or write working@duke.edu.

(Nasdaq: CVAC) (“CureVac”), a global biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of transformative medicines based on messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”), today announced selection of a promising vaccine candidate for continued clinical development based on positive data from an interim analysis of the ongoing Phase 1 part of a combined Phase 1/2 study, conducted in collaboration with GSK. The Phase 1 part compared a comprehensive series of multivalent, modified mRNA seasonal flu vaccine candidates with up to eight separate mRNA constructs per candidate, addressing all four WHO-recommended flu strains. The selected vaccine candidate will be advanced to the Phase 2 part of the study, which is expected to dose the first participant in Q4 2023 and will expand to include older adults aged 65 to 85. “We are very pleased with the interim results from the Phase 1 part of the study, which provided a strong basis to move our clinical development forward into Phase 2,” said Dr. Myriam Mendila, Chief Development Officer of CureVac. “The power, flexibility and speed of our mRNA tech­nology platform offers tremendous potential to overcome the current challenges associated with providing seasonally updated and highly effective influenza vaccines. We feel confident that our differen­tiated vaccine candidate has the potential to offer people broad protection and will advance us on the path to transforming public health.” Vaccine candidates in the Phase 1 part of the combined Phase 1/2 study were tested at different dose levels in 270 healthy younger adults (age 18-50). Interim safety data showed no safety concerns across all tested dose levels for the multi­valent candidates. Immunogenicity of all candidates was assessed in parallel with a licensed seasonal flu vaccine comparator. The humoral responses observed supported the selection of a candidate vaccine for further evaluation in Phase 2 in younger and older adults.

The new strains include viruses that have jumped from humans to pigs and some strains with genes that originate from North America. The findings point to a need for stronger surveillance methods to identify new viruses and assess their transmission risks before they become a major threat. Full details of the study and findings are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The team was led by scientists in Duke-NUS’ Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) program with collaborators at the National Animal Health and Production Research Institute in Phnom Penh, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and elsewhere. Over several months in 2022, the team gathered over 4,000 nasal swabs from pigs in 18 slaughterhouses located in four Cambodian provinces. About 2% of the tested population, or 72 pigs, tested positive for influenza A viral strains, according to the paper. In the positive cases, the scientists identified nine distinct influenza A virus groups. Some of the strains had multiple H3 lineages that passed from humans to pigs and have been circulating undetected in pigs for about 10 years. This included an H1N1 subtype that is linked to the 2009 swine flu pandemic. The team also detected two seasonal viruses in pigs from three provinces, Kandal, Phnom Penh, and Takeo, that likely originated from Thailand. And they isolated a new European H1N2 variant in pigs—originally from birds—that has North American genes. Genomic analysis of this strain suggests that it has been circulating in Cambodian pigs since 2014 although this is the first time that it has been identified. Furthermore, the scientists connected European swine flu viruses to South Central China and Southeast Asia. They found that South Central China has been the major source of European-like swine flu virus transmission in the region since 2010. From there, the strains spread across China and into other Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia. “The long-term evolution of different lineages has led to the establishment of genetically distinct viruses that have been continuously circulating in pig populations undetected for decades,” said Yvonne Su, PhD, an associate professor at Duke-NUS and a senior and corresponding author of the study. “Our study revealed the hidden and complex genomic landscape of swine flu virus evolution in Southeast Asia, marking the region as a hotspot for virus diversity and risk of new virus emergence.” More studies are needed to assess the pandemic threat of these new viruses including how easily they might spread and interact with other human viruses. The Duke-NUS team and their collaborators are currently working on a platform that can identify major swine flu genetic subtypes including avian sequences and monitor their transmission potential. The platform will also be able to assess if pig and human populations have been infected with the influenza subtypes. “While swine influenza viruses typically cause mild symptoms in pigs, they pose a pandemic threat to humans, as the human population may lack immunity or have inadequate protection against new strains of swine influenza viruses,” said Gavin Smith, PhD, director of the EID program and one of the study’s authors. “Therefore, systematic surveillance is crucial in early detection and warning of new subtypes or strains.” NewsGlobal healthInfluenza virusPig Share FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddItEmail Previous articleNew Indicators of Health, Disease, and Aging Unlocked by the LipidomeNext articleLights, Camera: Actio Biosciences Launches to Bridge Common and Rare Disease Treatments Uduak Thomas Also of Interest The 100 Million Cell Challenge Announces Winning Projects Flu Vaccine Strategy Pairs Injection and Nasal Spray, Shows Promise in Pigs Flu Vaccine Protects Nonhuman Primates Against Avian H5N1 Universal Flu Vaccine May No Longer Be a Long Shot Xenotransplantation of 10GE Pig Kidneys to NHPs Shows Consistent Survival CRISPRed Pigs: Precision Porcine Gene Editing Combats PRRS Virus Threat Related Media Paving Roads with Pig Manure Related Content The 100 Million Cell Challenge Announces Winning Projects Flu Vaccine Strategy Pairs Injection and Nasal Spray, Shows Promise in Pigs Flu Vaccine Protects Nonhuman Primates Against Avian H5N1 Universal Flu Vaccine May No Longer Be a Long Shot Read the Digital Edition ExploreAbout GEN Contact GEN GEN Staff Editorial Guidelines Reprints and Permissions Scientific Advisory Board AdvertiseMedia Kit and Planning Calendar Advertising Terms and Conditions ResourcesGet the GEN Magazine Get the GEN Email Newsletter Inside Precision Medicine Privacy Policy Copyright © 2024 Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News.

Researchers also say that the findings raise concerns of a potential epidemic or pandemic in the making and that concerted research is necessary to closely monitor such viruses in poultry and humans. The results, which have been published in Cell, report on the characterization of a human isolate – from a human patient – of the H3N8 avian influenza virus (AIV). Using laboratory mice and ferrets as models for human infection, the study found that virus has undergone several adaptive changes to cause severe animal infections and making it transmissible by the airborne route between animals. Human populations, even when vaccinated against human H3N2 virus, appear immunologically naïve to emerging mammalian-adapted H3N8 AIVs and could be vulnerable to infection at epidemic or pandemic proportion. Professor Jinhua Liu, China Agricultural University in Beijing In humans, the avian H3N8 virus infection has been found to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and can even be fatal. The virus is widespread in chicken flocks; however previously, the features of how it might be transmitted from animals to humans is poorly understood. “We demonstrate that an avian H3N8 virus isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia replicated efficiently in human bronchial and lung epithelial cells, was extremely harmful in its effects in laboratory mammalian hosts and could be passed on through respiratory droplets,” says Professor Kin-Chow Chang, at the University of Nottingham. “Importantly, we discovered that the virus had acquired human receptor binding preference and amino acid substitution PB2-E627K, which are necessary for airborne transmission. Human populations, even when vaccinated against human H3N2 virus, appear immunologically naïve to emerging mammalian adapted H3N8 AIVs and could be vulnerable to infection at epidemic or pandemic proportion. “Acid resistance of influenza virus is also an important barrier for avian influenza virus to overcome to acquire the adaptability and transmissibility in new mammals or humans. The current novel H3N8 virus has not acquired the acid resistance yet. So, we should pay attention to the change on acid resistance of the novel H3N8 virus.” Airborne transmission of human-isolated avian H3N8 influenza virus between ferrets. Cell, 4 September 2023.

Summary What CDC knows Analysis from CDC's Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics shows that with the addition of a third virus (COVID-19) that can cause severe illness, even an average respiratory season can place significant strain on our healthcare system. What CDC is doing CDC recommends staying up to date on the vaccines recommended for you as an important strategy to prevent severe disease and protect yourself and others around you. Higher levels of vaccination across the population will also help reduce the number of hospitalizations and risk of hospital strain. Analysis Along with the seasonal influenza virus (flu) and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), COVID-19 has become a part of the respiratory virus season. Analysis from CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics shows that with the addition of a third virus (COVID-19) that can cause severe disease, even an average respiratory season can place significant strain on our healthcare system. Fall and winter are a time when viruses that cause respiratory disease usually circulate more heavily in the community. Before COVID-19, two viruses, influenza virus (flu) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), were the main causes of severe respiratory disease during this time of year. Although some people have mild symptoms when they catch flu or RSV, others get sick enough to be hospitalized. Some seasons are more severe than others based on strains of the viruses circulating and our immunity to these viruses. One measure of the severity of a season is how many people are sick enough to be hospitalized, because this can stress the healthcare system. CDC expects this year will be similar to last year in terms of the total number of hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV, and flu. As with last year, the total number of hospitalizations this year is expected to be higher than what we as a nation experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Flu activity in the United States is currently low and although the timing, intensity, and severity of the upcoming flu season cannot be predicted, it is likely to increase over the fall and winter. Flu vaccination remains the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones against flu and its potentially serious outcomes. RSV activity in the United States is also low currently and is likely to increase. Vaccination against these respiratory viruses is important for everyone and especially for those who are at higher risk of developing serious complications, including older Americans and those with medical conditions. As we learn more, we will update our expectations.

Dashed lines show hospitalization levels for specific viruses in previous years for comparison. These scenarios illustrate how the additional burden from COVID-19 during a moderate season for the three respiratory diseases (left bar) may generate more hospital demand than a severe influenza and RSV season prior to the emergence of COVID-19 (bottom dashed line).Show More Keep Reading: CDC’s Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics Vaccines for COVID-19, flu & RSV The U.S. 2023-2024 flu vaccines have a similar vaccine virus composition as the 2023 Southern Hemisphere flu vaccines. A new CDC study, which looked at children and adults in five South American countries during the 2023 winter flu season (our summertime), shows flu vaccine performed well against those viruses. This study found that people who had received a flu vaccine were half as likely to be hospitalized with flu compared to people who had not been vaccinated. This finding shows that flu vaccine provides protection against serious outcomes. For the first time in U.S. history, vaccines for all three major respiratory viruses – COVID-19, flu, and RSV – will be available this fall. Making sure that you are up to date on the vaccines recommended for you is an important strategy to prevent severe disease and protect yourself and others around you. Higher levels of vaccination across the population will also help reduce the number of hospitalizations and risk of hospital strain.

Study: Chatbot-Delivered Online Intervention to Promote Seasonal Influenza Vaccination During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Image Credit: BaLL LunLa/Shutterstock.com Background SIV can effectively prevent influenza and mortality among older adults. The Center for Health Protection in Hong Kong recommends that adults aged 65 or older receive SIV yearly. Although SIV is free for this age group in Hong Kong, its coverage is inadequate and was 40.4% in 2021-22. Fewer trials have compared the efficacy of mailing reminders to no intervention but had small effect sizes. Although home visits and telephone sessions appear effective and have larger effect sizes, they are more resource-intensive. One study observed that standard verbal education by medical students was effective in increasing SIV uptake. Nevertheless, tailored interventions for SIV are lacking among older adults. A stage of change (SOC) measures readiness for behavioral change. A meta-analysis revealed higher efficacy of SOC-tailored interventions, especially in less motivated subjects, than interventions not tailored to SOCs. Chatbots can be potentially valuable in delivering SOC-tailored interventions promoting SIV. About the study In the present study, researchers assessed the efficacy of chatbot-delivered SOC-tailored interventions in improving SIV uptake among older adults in Hong Kong. This non-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed between December 2021 and July 2022. Related StoriesStudy confirms flu vaccine effectiveness against A H1N1 in young childrenNew project launched to accelerate development and accessibility of H5N1 mRNA vaccine candidatesStudy reveals distinct genetic risk factors for influenza and COVID-19Eligible subjects were community-dwelling, Cantonese- or Mandarin-speaking smartphone users aged 65 or older who did not take SIV during the 2021-22 influenza season. Individuals with contraindications to SIV, cognitive impairment, deafness, blindness, or the inability to communicate were excluded. Random telephone sampling was implemented for recruitment. Participants were offered supermarket coupons after the baseline survey and six months post-intervention. Subjects were randomized to the intervention or control arm after the baseline survey. Intervention participants watched one of the SOC-tailored health promotional videos on SIV uptake every two weeks for four sessions. The messages in the videos followed strategies to facilitate SOC progression. Four videos with slight variations were prepared to prevent repetition. Participants' SOC was assessed based on their intention to receive SIV. SOCs included pre-contemplation, contemplation, and preparation stages. The pre-contemplation stage was defined as having no intention to take SIV in the next six months. The contemplation stage was the intention to receive SIV in the next six months without plans to take SIV in the next month. The preparation stage was the intention to take SIV in the next month. Beginning the second session, subjects were asked if they had already been vaccinated for the upcoming influenza season, and positive responders were deemed to be at the action stage. Similarly, controls received standard videos at the same intervals. Information in these videos was identical to that disseminated by the government through mass media. The study's outcomes included SIV uptake at six months and SOC at baseline and six months. Findings Overall, 396 participants completed the baseline survey; they were aged, on average, 70.2. Most subjects (62.9%) were females. Approximately 60% of participants had ever been vaccinated for influenza. About 37.4%, 22%, and 40.6% of participants were at the pre-contemplation, contemplation, and preparation stages, respectively. At six months, 100 and 70 participants in the intervention and control groups were at the action stage. The SIV uptake rate and the average SOC score were significantly higher among intervention subjects than controls. Among the 117 intervention participants completing at least two sessions, 55.6% progressed to a higher SOC, with a statistically significant increase in their mean SOC score from the first to the (most) recent session. More intervention participants completed at least one session than controls, and many in the intervention group (80%) were satisfied with the promotional messages in the videos. Conclusions The study revealed a higher efficacy of SOC-tailored intervention in improving SIV uptake than the standard, non-SOC-tailored intervention, with about ten percentage points higher SIV uptake rate in the intervention group than the overall SIV coverage among older adults in Hong Kong. The intervention system was viable to provide tailored health promotional messages according to participants' SOC and required fewer resources, given that it can automatically evaluate SOC and select appropriate interventions. Overall, the findings suggest that SOC-tailored interventions may be (more) sustainable in increasing SIV uptake. Journal reference: Wang, Z. et al.

You may wonder if wearing a mask to protect against COVID-19 is even worth doing, as many of those who have gotten the virus recently have been reporting mild symptoms. But the coronavirus is still infecting people. This summer brought an uptick in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, and a winter spike is also possible, based on the virus’s seasonal behavior in previous years. There are also two new Omicron subvariants, EG.5 (Eris) and BA.2.86 (Pirola), which may be more transmissible than their predecessors. And SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, isn’t the only highly contagious virus that makes people sick. Flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have also overwhelmed hospitals in previous years. Together, the three diseases—and the uptick in cases of each simultaneously during fall and winter—have become known as a ‘tripledemic.’ Across the U.S., there has been a smattering of new mask mandates in schools, businesses, and other places in response to recent COVID-19 surges; however, infections and hospitalizations are still lower than in previous years, and no one expects the country to go back to widespread masking, which means that people will have to decide how to best protect themselves. “People can make their own choices about wearing masks to protect against COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases now,” says Karen Jubanyik, MD, a Yale Medicine emergency medicine specialist who has cared for patients with COVID-19. As a result, some people are adopting what's called "strategic masking"—wearing a mask when and where it might matter the most. While most people don’t want—or need—to wear a mask all the time, “It makes good sense to be strategic about it,” Dr. Jubanyik says. Individual risk for infection, the need to protect loved ones who are at high risk, personal risk tolerance, and the degree to which viruses are circulating in a given area are all factors to be taken into account. Yale Medicine experts offer some recommendations to help address any confusion about when you might want to consider wearing a mask.1. Consider your personal risk—and that of those around you.If you are at high risk for severe disease from COVID-19 (see more on that below), it would be smart to wear a mask in public indoor spaces, especially if the coronavirus is circulating in your area, says Dr. Jubanyik. To assess the situation in your county, you can check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s COVID-19 hospital admissions by county, which provides information on whether hospital admissions are low, medium, or high in your area. Everyone’s situation is different. If you are at high risk for severe disease, the CDC recommends talking to your health care provider about whether you and the people around you should wear a mask or respirator (see more on that below) when hospital admissions for COVID-19 are at a medium or high level. You are at higher risk than other people for a severe outcome from COVID-19 if: You are age 50 or older, with the risk increasing with age (more than 81% of COVID-19 deaths are in those ages 65 and older—that’s 97 times higher than deaths among people ages 18 to 29 years).You are any age with certain medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or obesity. You are pregnant.You live in a long-term care facility.You face barriers to accessing health care, including lack of health insurance, transportation, childcare, or the ability to take time off from work. (These factors have contributed to racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in some cases of severe COVID-19.) Everyone, including young, healthy people, might consider wearing a mask in some situations if they live in a geographical area where the virus is spreading. Even if your personal risk is not high, you might want to wear a mask in more situations than usual to avoid infection and protect loved ones—you won’t always know if you have been exposed, and you have the potential to spread the virus even if you don’t have symptoms. 2. Consider wearing a mask in a doctor’s office or when visiting someone in a hospital.Wearing a mask may be a personal choice when visiting a doctor or a hospital. Not all medical centers require masks now, although some that abandoned mask mandates are discussing bringing them back in response to the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases. Authors of an article published in July in the New England Journal of Medicine said that while COVID-19 vaccines and treatments have helped to reduce hospitalizations and deaths from the disease, extra care may be needed in hospitals, where acute illness makes patients especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Wearing masks in this setting could help protect you and others from viruses that can also exacerbate any underlying conditions, causing such problems as lung disease flares, arrhythmias, and even death, according to the article. 3. Carry a mask when you go out, and make a personal choice about whether to use it.A mask may seem obvious in some situations; others will involve a judgment call. An activity that seems low-risk for one person may be anxiety-ridden for another. In the latter situation, people should do what makes them feel the most comfortable, Dr. Jubanyik explains. Some examples: Shopping: Decide whether to wear a mask based on the store size and foot traffic. “If you're walking into a big department store where the ceilings are extraordinarily high and you’re not standing close to anyone for a long period of time, there may not be a lot of benefit to wearing a mask,” Dr. Jubanyik says. “But in a small, crowded gift shop during the holiday season—or in any small, crowded space without adequate ventilation—a mask can help protect against infection.”Eating in a restaurant: Obviously, you can’t wear a mask while you are eating. If you want to dine out but have concerns, choose your restaurant accordingly. Eating outside is safer than eating indoors; eating indoors is safer when the ventilation is good and the tables are spread out, explains Yale Medicine infectious diseases specialist Scott Roberts, MD, who has been eating in restaurants occasionally. “Will I make that same decision in December or January? I'm not sure. I'd have to see the case numbers,” he says, adding that a winter uptick in cases could cause him to take a break from dining out.Traveling: Respiratory infections, including COVID-19, flu, and the common cold, are the leading reasons returning travelers seek medical care, according to the CDC. Dr. Jubanyik carries and shares extra masks while traveling on planes, and advises that people also consider masking on trains, buses, and other forms of public transportation.Church services: For many people, including older adults and others at risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19, going to a place of worship provides an important sense of community that was disrupted during the pandemic, Dr. Jubanyik says. Church was considered a high-risk venue because it usually welcomes a large group into an enclosed space, has loud talking and singing, and involves being in close proximity to others for a prolonged period of time. “So, if you plan to attend church services, I would advise wearing a mask and making sure you're vaccinated,” she says.Important events and holidays: If you have an event coming up, such as a wedding, vacation, or holiday gathering that you have been planning for a while, wearing a mask in the preceding weeks can help lower your risk of infection and give you a better chance of being healthy when it comes up. “It might be smart to mask up in the days ahead of the big event—at least in the higher-risk situations, such as in a crowded room or on public transit,” Dr. Jubanyik says. “It’s also worth considering that many people have reported testing positive for COVID-19 after getting together with family or friends for the first time in a while and spending time together in closed spaces.”For kids in school: Some schools put mask mandates back in place, but for the most part, it’s still a personal choice, says Magna Dias, MD, a Yale Medicine pediatrician. She is, however, concerned about situations where kids have been bullied for wearing masks in school. “If there is an immunocompromised child, we would recommend they wear a mask and ask other people to be kind to them. I think that's an important message,” she says.Otherwise, in crowded situations in places where the rate of COVID-19 is high, she offers the same recommendations for kids as she would for adults, which is to wear a mask. “However, it’s harder for kids younger than 5 to wear a mask, so unless there's a high-risk situation, I wouldn't recommend making those children mask,” she says.While most children infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus experience mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, underlying medical conditions, having more than one pre-existing condition, and age (especially infancy) may put them at higher risk for severe illness, according to the CDC. Plus, there is the risk of developing Long COVID, a potentially serious condition in which COVID-19 symptoms persist for weeks, months, and even years after the initial infection.4. Consider how much time you’ll be spending indoors with other people.The length of time that you expect to be in a “high-risk” situation, such as a crowded room, matters. Contact for longer than 15 minutes with a person who has COVID-19 is more likely to result in transmission than two minutes of contact, according to the CDC. “Many people are infected in social settings and in households when people are indoors, in close contact, and without masks,” Dr. Jubanyik says. A study led by Yale School of Public Health scientists published in August in Nature Communications documented a long-held belief that high levels of exposure to the coronavirus may reduce or overcome the protection provided by vaccination and/or prior infection. Akiko Iwasaki, PhD, a Yale immunobiologist (who did not participate in the study), commented in Nature that the findings suggest that masking and improved ventilation, among other mitigation measures, could help reduce chances of infection, even among people who are vaccinated.5. Wear a mask that will protect you.The CDC provides specifics on the types of masks and respirators that can prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. They describe mask options that offer varying levels of protection, from well-fitting disposable surgical masks to KN95s to National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators (including N95s), with the latter providing the highest level of protection. They advise wearing the most protective mask you can that fits well and that you will wear consistently. 6. Don’t make masking your only preventive strategy.Whether you wear them strategically or all the time, masks can reduce your risk of getting infected, but they aren’t perfect. “If you are the only person in a crowded room wearing one, you’ll get less protection than you would if everyone wore one,” says Dr. Roberts. That’s why masking should be one strategy among many to protect against respiratory infections, especially this winter when SARS-CoV-2, flu, and RSV are expected to be circulating simultaneously. The first line of defense is vaccination, Dr. Roberts says. This fall, in addition to the annual flu vaccine, there is an updated COVID-19 booster shot, approved by the FDA and CDC in early September for everyone ages 6 months and older. There also are new preventive options for RSV, such as vaccines for older people, and RSV treatments for young children, such as a monoclonal antibody for infants and toddlers and a vaccine given to pregnant women to provide antibodies that will protect their newborn infants from birth to 6 months. Staying away from sick people, maintaining a six-foot distance from other people, avoiding crowded indoor places, washing your hands properly, and seeking out good air filtration are also things that make a difference, Dr. Roberts says. And while the protection provided by wearing a mask isn’t 100%, it’s certainly better than zero, he adds. “I plan to mask strategically, and if the COVID-19 numbers rise, I'll probably mask everywhere,” he says.Read more Yale Medicine newsRelated SpecialistsMagna DiasMDScott RobertsMDKaren JubanyikMDMore Related SpecialistsRelated Fact SheetsCoronavirusCoronavirus is a term describes a family of viruses, common in both animals and humans.CroupA respiratory infection that mainly affects children and causes a barking cough, hoarseness, and breathing difficulties.Colds: How to Prevent ThemThe common cold is probably the most universal illness.

Fall and winter mark the traditional flu season, as more activities take place indoors and holiday travel is popular. COVID-19 is also more transmissible in confined spaces, so there is increased risk for respiratory viruses during this period. The CDC recommends getting the flu and COVID vaccines at the same time. County residents should contact their primary health care provider or local pharmacy for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, which are available at no cost for those with insurance. Many pharmacies offer free COVID-19 to residents without insurance – call or check pharmacy websites to learn more. Residents without health coverage may also contact County Health at (650) 573-2877 or email SMCHealth_IZ@smcgov.org to learn how to access flu and COVID-19 vaccines at no cost. For its patients, San Mateo Medical Center is updating its systems and processes to reflect the new COVID-19 guidelines and will offer vaccination after the updated COVID-19 vaccine becomes available. Patients assigned to SMMC should contact their clinic for more information and to schedule an appointment. It’s important to be up to date with flu and COVID-19 vaccination. Flu shots are formulated annually to target the strains of influenza that are expected to circulate during the fall and winter months. Similarly, the updated COVID-19 vaccine targets recently circulating variants and offers broad protection against the worst outcomes of the disease. “If you are eligible, this is a good time to get both the influenza and updated COVID vaccines to help protect you from severe illness and hospitalization in the upcoming respiratory virus season,” said San Mateo County Health Officer Dr. Kismet Baldwin-Santana. Respiratory virus season also sees an increase in cases of RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), which causes symptoms similar to those from COVID-19 and flu. The CDC says that adults 60 years and older may receive a single dose of RSV vaccine, based on discussions between the patient and health care provider. RSV vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Residents should consult their health care provider.

Influenza vaccines approved according to the centralised registration procedure coordinated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have also been authorised. The composition of all influenza vaccines for the 2023-2024 season follows the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA. The Circular of the Ministry of Health "Prevention and control of influenza: recommendations for the 2023-2024 season" of 21 April 2023 recommends "in consideration of the epidemiological situation relating to the circulation of respiratory viruses in the 2022-2023 season, compatibly with the availability of vaccine, to anticipate the conduct of flu vaccination campaigns from the beginning of October and to offer vaccination to eligible individuals at any time during the flu season, even if they are late for vaccination. his may be particularly important if there will be a late influenza season or when at-risk patients present. This may be particularly important if there will be a late influenza season or when at-risk patients present. Therefore, the decision to vaccinate should take into account the level of incidence of influenza-like syndrome in the community, keeping in mind that the immune response to vaccination takes approximately two weeks to fully develop." AIFA recalls that, in addition to protection and treatment measures based on vaccinations and the possible use of antiviral drugs, an important measure in limiting the spread of influenza is represented by good hygiene of hands and respiratory secretions (for example wash your hands regularly and frequently with soap and water; cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze and then throw it in the garbage; regularly ventilate the rooms in which you stay). AIFA invites everyone to report suspected adverse reactions that occur after the administration of a vaccine, as the reports contribute to the continuous monitoring of the benefitisk ratio of vaccines like of any other medicine. Please remember that healthcare professionals are required to report any suspected adverse reactions observed. It is also possible to make a spontaneous report of a suspected adverse reaction according to one of the methods indicated in the dedicated section of the AIFA portal.

The University of New Mexico Health System partnered with the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH), Presbyterian Healthcare Services, Lovelace Health System and Christus St. Vincent to bring the community the most up-to-date information on COVID, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This is the first fall and winter virus season where vaccines are available for all three viruses. COVID-19 Vaccine Updates Across New Mexico, state health officials reported a recent increase in COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, but NMDOH medical director Miranda Durham, MD, said numbers remain low compared to recent years. “We'd really like to see it stay that way through the winter,” she said during a joint news conference. “Which is why we're here talking about the great new vaccines that can help protect us all.” Durham explained there are several new variants of the virus currently circulating, but the variants are all related and will respond to the latest COVID-19 vaccine, which will arrive in New Mexico by the end of this week and be available with most providers by the end of September. “This is a COVID vaccine that's meant for this fall and winter season, and everyone six months and older can get one of these updated COVID vaccines, regardless of your past vaccination status,” Durham stated the exception would be for anyone who is currently COVID positive or has received a COVID vaccine in the past two months. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for isolation and COVID precautions remain unchanged. Those who test positive for COVID are asked to isolate for five days. Isolation can be discontinued after 5 days if a person has no fever and symptoms are improving. The CDC then recommends wearing a mask for an additional five days. Those who are in contact with someone who tests positive do not have to isolate, but it’s recommended they wear a mask and test after five days. The NMDOH also announced it retired its former vaccination enrollment website but introduced a new website that allows New Mexicans to find vaccine availability in real time. Flu Vaccine Updates UNM Hospital epidemiologist, Meghan Brett, MD, said there are no predictions for the severity of this year’s flu season. She recommends everyone take precautions, starting with the flu vaccine in September or October. “The flu vaccines that are being offered this year, are all quadrivalent,” she said. “That means that they have four flu strains in them.” Flu vaccines are available for people six months and older. A higher dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine is recommended for people 65 and older. “However, if those are not available, then it is important just to get the flu vaccine itself that is otherwise available,” Brett said. New this year, Brett said, is that anybody can receive a flu immunization, even if they have a history of egg allergies, because the amount of protein from eggs in the latest batch of vaccines is incredibly low. New RSV Inoculations for Children and Adults Associate chief medical officer for the UNM Children’s Hospital Anna Duran, MD, said she is projecting a normal timeline for RSV this year, peaking between November and early March. “RSV is very contagious,” she explained. “It’s transmitted by direct contact, and it lives on surfaces for quite a long time. A majority of children will have seen RSV by the time they turn two years of age.” Beyfortus is a new immunization approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to protect healthy children up to two years-old against severe RSV cases. Duran said recent clinical trials showed a near 75% decrease in medical and emergency room visits and hospitalizations, as a result of the immunization. Children who are newborn up to eight months, during RSV season, are eligible for a Beyfortus injection. Children eight months to 19 months of age, with certain medical conditions, are also eligible. For parents with children older than two years old, Duran says RSV will typically present itself like a normal cold and can usually be treated with over-the-counter medication, but there are warning signs that parents should look for. “If your child is showing signs of difficulty breathing, isn't wanting to drink or showing signs of dehydration, that's a great time to seek medical care in an emergency room,” Duran said. “If your child has a fever for more than five days, this is a time to start talking to your primary care provider or go to an urgent care center.” Another new RSV vaccine is available for adults, ages 60 and older. “Each year about 100,000 adults over the age of 60 are hospitalized in the U.S. due to RSV,” said Denise Gonzales, MD, medical director at Presbyterian Healthcare Services. “Additional risk groups include those with heart disease and those living in long term care.” Providers recommend treating RSV symptoms for both children and adults at home. If symptoms for adults include shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, signs of stroke, or persistent fever beyond five days, then Gonzales would encourage them to talk to their primary care provider or seek emergency medical care. Vaccine Hesitancy During a joint news conference, Lovelace Health System’s chief medical officer Vesta Sandoval, MD, addressed the apprehension some people may have toward vaccines. “Misinformation was disseminated about vaccines, not just the COVID vaccine, but many other types of vaccines as well and that has generated a lot of fear,” she said. “The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized that vaccine hesitancy or resistance is actually a top threat to global health.” Sandoval said before the pandemic, WHO estimated five million deaths per year could be saved by vaccinations. She encouraged people to talk to their providers if they are unsure about an immunization. “Go to a trusted source, go to somebody who has real information, who can tell you about the vaccine,” she said. “We've given millions and millions of these vaccines. We know they're safe. We know that the side effects are very minimal.” Getting Care to Rural New Mexicans In recent years, hospital leaders across New Mexico have worked to fill health care gaps in rural communities. For example, Santa Fe, Taos, Los Alamos and Colfax counties have higher flu vaccination rates than Union, San Miguel and Rio Arriba counties, where fewer than 50 percent of the population is vaccinated against the flu. “I think rural communities struggle to access care,” said David Gonzales, MD, chief medical officer at Christus St. Vincent in Santa Fe. “Some reasons are distance to their primary care location or transportation needs, and this can prevent people from seeking any type of medical care.” In addition, Gonzales said rural hospitals struggle with staffing, finances and capacity. “We're already over capacity, and we're all concerned about what respiratory season will look like,” he said. “So, it’s going to be really important that we form tight partnerships amongst our regional, federally qualified health centers, primary care clinics and community organizations, in both preventing and managing this respiratory season.” Gonzales said it is possible to avoid illness, and in turn avoid over-saturating already overwhelmed hospitals. This year, there are effective preventive measures for all three major viruses that are contributing to respiratory season and hospitalizations. Respiratory illness preventive measures: Get vaccinated (it is safe to receive vaccines for multiple viruses at once) Wash hands regularly Mask in public places indoors Stay home, if not feeling well Mask around people who are immunocompromised or frail “The above measures not only can protect you, but those you love and your fellow New Mexicans,” David Gonzales, MD, chief medical officer for Christus St. Vincent said.

They are key sentinels against subsequent viral variants. Lung-resident memory B cells produced during influenza are long-living immune cells that migrate to the lungs from draining lymph nodes and lie in wait as early responders that can quickly react to future infections. They are key sentinels against subsequent viral variants.During a bout of influenza, B cells interact with other immune cells and then take different paths to defend the body. One path is the B cells that differentiate into antibody producing cells. Another path is the B cells that differentiate into lung-resident memory B cells, or lung-BRMs, that are critical for pulmonary immunity. Unlike antibody-producing B cells that help fight the current infection, the long-lived, non-circulating lung-BRMs migrate to the lungs from draining lymph nodes. They reside there permanently and lie in wait as the first layer of defense that can quickly react to produce antibodies in a future infection. Understanding the mechanism that creates these lung-BRMs is important for better flu vaccine development. Seasonal influenza kills 290,000 to 650,000 people each year, according to the World Health Organization. Yet flu vaccines are less effective in the elderly — the most at-risk population — compared to younger people. Also, there is need for vaccines that are more effective against later variants of a particular virus. André Ballesteros-Tato, Ph.D., and colleagues at the University of Alabama at Birmingham have now published a mouse-model study in the journal Immunity showing that interferon-gamma produced by T follicular helper cells, or Tfh cells, after intranasal influenza infection is required to initiate the path of B cell differentiation into lung-BRMs. Ballesteros-Tato is an associate professor in the UAB Department of Medicine Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology. During influenza infection, both Tfh and B cells are present at germinal centers in the lymph nodes that drain the lungs. Class-switched memory B cells that are primed against the influenza virus begin to appear in the lungs at day 10 of the infection, and their numbers peak at Day 30. However, the UAB researchers found that, if mice were deficient in Tfh cells, or if the Tfh cells were blocked by an antibody, the lung-BRMs did not accumulate. Thus, Tfh cell help is required for class-switched-specific BRM responses to influenza. What role do the Tfh cells play? The UAB researchers found that the preferential differentiation of lung-BRMs early after infection correlated with differences in the Tfh cell response early in the viral infection. They found that the number of Tfh cells increased quickly and peaked between days 10 and 15. By Day 10, early in the flu infection, nearly 40 percent of the Tfh cells were producing interferon-gamma, or INF-γ; but that frequency dropped sharply thereafter. Andre Ballesteros-Tato, Ph.D.The production of INF-γ by Tfh cells turned out to be key to the lung-BRM response in flu. Ballesteros-Tato and colleagues found that mice whose Tfh cells were unable to produce INF-γ had a dramatically reduced frequency and number of influenza-specific BRMs in the lungs. Furthermore, the absence of INF-γ-producing Tfh cells, and therefore fewer lung-BRMs, was shown to compromise immune protection when mice were later reinfected with a different strain of influenza. The researchers asked whether the requirement for IFN-γ signaling in lung-BRM development was intrinsic to B cells, meaning the interferon was producing effects inside the B cells. They found that mice whose B cells lacked the receptor for INF-γ had significantly diminished numbers of flu-specific BRMs after influenza virus infection. Inside B cells, the transcription factor STAT1 is known to be required for optimal INF-γ signaling. The researchers found that mice whose B cells lacked STAT1 also failed to accumulate flu-specific BRMs after influenza infection. In mechanistic details, the researchers found that intrinsic IFN-γ-STAT1 signaling in B cells in the germinal center of lung-draining lymph nodes promoted expression of the T-bet transcription factor, and T-bet was necessary for differentiation into pre-memory B cells that express the surface marker CXCR3. Subsequently, CXCR3+ pre-memory B cells differentiated into CXCR3+ memory B cells, which exited the mediastinal lymph nodes and homed to the lung to become lung-BRMs. “In this proposed model, CXCR3+ memory B cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes are the precursors of lung-BRMs,” said Ballesteros-Tato. “Our data provide evidence of a critical role for IFN-γ-producing Tfh cells in generating lung-BRM responses and provide new insights into the mechanisms that fine-tune germinal center B cell fate decisions after influenza virus infection.” “This knowledge is essential for designing new vaccine strategies tailored to elicit potent lung-BRM responses, which have the potential to generate enhanced cross-protection to escape variants.” Co-authors with Ballesteros-Tato in the study, “Interferon-γ production by Tfh cells is required for CXCR3+ pre-memory B cell differentiation and subsequent lung-resident memory B cell responses,” are Nicole M.

Here's what you need to know: Is there an RSV vaccine?There are a few prevention tools for RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, an illness that typically causes cold-like symptoms but can sometimes be severe, especially for infants and older adults. "(There's) a vaccine for the elderly for people 60 and up," Gounder says. "For this one, we recommend you talk to your health care provider and see if they recommend it for you."There is also a new kind of immunization to protect babies from RSV that was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The drug, nirsevimab, is one of two new options doctors hope could soon prevent many cases of the illness, which is the leading cause of hospitalization facing American infants. Drugmakers AstraZeneca and Sanofi will market it under the brand name Beyfortus.As Gounder explains, it isn't a vaccine but a monoclonal antibody shot."This is to protect young infants who are very high risk for severe RSV," Gounder says. "If you have an infant who is 8 months or less, all infants are recommended. For infants eight to 19 months, it really depends on if they were born prematurely or have other risk factors." Previously, parents and doctors only had one option to shield some babies from RSV: monthly injections of palivizumab, an antibody drug which is recommended for use in infants and young children with conditions that put them at higher risk. Do I need a COVID booster?The U.S. has seen both an increase in COVID hospitalizations and an uptick in several newer COVID variants over the last few weeks. As summer comes to a close, there's concern that cases could rise more in the fall and winter.With the rollout of this fall's updated COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC recommends a new shot for nearly all Americans to reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization or death.The FDA says virtually all Americans as young as 6 months old are now approved or authorized to get at least one dose from either Pfizer or Moderna from their updated formulation. While the public has grown accustomed to calling additional shots "boosters," health officials are now moving away from the word "booster," instead calling this year's shots the "2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine" or simply the "updated COVID-19 vaccine." This clarification helps distinguish previous additional doses from this year's vaccine, which is an updated formula targeting more recent variants.FDA and CDC sign off on updated COVID vaccine. Here's what to know about the new shots for fall 2023.In the meantime, as cases are up, some experts suggest masking again to help reduce your risk.CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook says he likes to use the "weather report analogy." "What's the weather out today? If it's raining, you will probably want to bring an umbrella. If you are in an area where there is an uptick in airborne respiratory infections like COVID, flu or RSV, you may want to take extra precautions, such as wearing a high-quality mask in indoor public spaces," he said.Read more: Is masking coming back?

"Whenever you're able to get in to get your flu shot is a good time to do it."During last year's flu season, the flu shot provided "substantial protection" for all age groups, including elderly and immunocompromised populations, according to data the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported earlier this year.-Alexander Tin contributed to this report.

Can I send my child to school? When should I call their healthcare provider?AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy“Every child runs a gauntlet of infections during the first five years of their life,” says pediatric infectious disease specialist Frank Esper, MD. “Navigating childhood illnesses can be challenging for parents.”Dr. Esper explains how RSV, the flu and COVID-19 symptoms are similar and how they differ.Separate, but sometimes similar conditionsRSV, flu and COVID-19 are respiratory viruses. These viruses affect your respiratory system — the network of tissues and organs that help you breathe.“Cough, runny nose and fever are common to all respiratory viruses,” says Dr. Esper. “When I see a child with these symptoms, I usually rely on a laboratory test to make an accurate diagnosis.”Common symptomsWhen it comes to RSV vs. the flu vs. COVID-19, what should you look for? Dr. Esper says there are some subtle differences between RSV, the flu and COVID-19.SymptomsRSVFluCOVID-19Sore throat—CommonCommon CoughCommonCommonCommonSneezingCommonSometimes—FeverSometimesCommonCommonBody achesSometimesCommonSometimesTirednessSometimesCommonSometimesHeadacheSometimesCommonSometimesRunny/stuffy noseCommonSometimesSometimesShortness of breathSometimesSometimesSometimesLoss of taste and/smell——SometimesSymptomsSore throatRSV—FluCommonCOVID-19Common CoughRSVCommonFluCommonCOVID-19CommonSneezingRSVCommonFluSometimesCOVID-19—FeverRSVSometimesFluCommonCOVID-19CommonBody achesRSVSometimesFluCommonCOVID-19SometimesTirednessRSVSometimesFluCommonCOVID-19SometimesHeadacheRSVSometimesFluCommonCOVID-19SometimesRunny/stuffy noseRSVCommonFluSometimesCOVID-19SometimesShortness of breathRSVSometimesFluSometimesCOVID-19SometimesLoss of taste and/smellRSV—Flu—COVID-19SometimesSymptoms unique to RSVRSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a virus nearly all children get by age 2. In addition to a cough, runny nose and fever, a unique symptom of RSV is wheezing. A wheeze sounds like a whistle or rattle when your child breathes.Most children recover from RSV on their own, but sometimes, it can lead to severe illnesses such as:Bronchiolitis, swelling of the small airways in your child’s lungs.Pneumonia, an infection of your child’s lungs.AdvertisementRSV can infect people of any age, but is most serious for young children and older adults. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. hospitals admits an estimated 58,000-80,000 children under age 5 for RSV every year.Symptoms unique to the fluA distinctive sign of the flu is a very high fever. Along with other respiratory symptoms, the flu causes high fevers of 103 or 104 degrees Fahrenheit (39.44 or 40 degrees Celsius). People usually feel miserable, more so than with other viruses, says Dr. Esper. This can include nausea and vomiting as well, which, though not unique to the flu, is also often worse than with other viruses.Children under age 5, and especially under age 2, are at higher risk of complications from the flu. These include:Dehydration.Inflammation of their heart, brain or muscle tissues.Pneumonia.Sinus and ear infections.Each year, between 6,000 and 27,000 children younger than 5 years old develop symptoms serious enough to require hospitalization.Symptoms unique to COVID-19The signs of COVID-19 are similar to flu and RSV. But unlike the other viruses, COVID-19 can have a serious effect on body systems outside the lungs.“Flu can do this, too, but the symptoms usually go away once the virus leaves your lungs,” states Dr. Esper. “COVID can cause long-term effects, such as brain fog.”Several symptoms you may think are unique to COVID-19 are actually common among respiratory viruses. For example:Loss of taste and smell: Many viruses, including those that cause the common cold and flu, can affect your sense of taste and smell.Vomiting and diarrhea: Up to 30% of children with respiratory viruses have gastrointestinal symptoms, says Dr. Esper.Testing and treatmentIf your child has a runny nose, cough and fever — the telltale signs of a respiratory virus — a COVID-19 test is a good first step. Knowing if your kid has COVID-19 can help you protect other family members and prevent the spread outside of your household.Many clinics use a triple test that can detect RSV, the flu and COVID-19. And you can also buy an at-home PCR test that includes testing for RSV, flu and COVID-19. But Dr. Esper notes you won’t get immediate results because you have to send the sample to a lab for processing.“The processing time is 24 to 48 hours after they receive the test,” he explains. “Therefore, it can be several days before you find the results.”Home testing for RSV and flu has many benefits:A diagnosis of RSV at home could help you know when to keep your baby out of daycare. This could protect other children from RSV, which spreads rapidly in childcare settings.An RSV diagnosis is also helpful to isolate your child from family members who are prone to getting bad lung infections.Early identification of flu could help people get the treatment they need quicker. Early treatment with a medications called Tamiflu® (more commonly used) or Xofluza® (less common) significantly reduces how long you’re sick with the flu.AdvertisementCan you have a co-infection?Co-infection — when you have multiple viruses at once — is common in children. In any childcare or preschool room, you’ll find children sick with a range of viruses.“When they’re all coughing, it’s not surprising that a child can catch two or even three viruses at the same time,” notes Dr. Esper. “We saw co-infections before the pandemic, and we’re seeing them now with RSV, flu and COVID-19.”But he hasn’t seen any evidence that having more than one virus leads to worse symptoms or outcomes. Providers treat infections the same way, whether there are one or three.In addition to wearing a mask and physical distancing, these steps can reduce your risk of respiratory infections:Get your child vaccinated for RSV, flu and COVID-19 (if your child is eligible).Sanitize high-contact surfaces, such as desks, tables and doorknobs if someone in your household is sick.Wash your hands regularly or use hand sanitizer.Additionally, it’s helpful to keep your child home if they’re sick. This minimizes the risk of spreading illness to other children at school.Bottom line?Children usually recover from respiratory viruses on their own with rest and fluids. Dr. Esper recommends reaching out to your child’s healthcare provider if they have:AdvertisementTrouble breathing.Severe vomiting and diarrhea to a point where they’re not eating or drinking.Symptoms that aren’t improving or are getting worse after five days.If your child has a high fever and you suspect it’s the flu, get in touch with their provider right away. Early treatment with Tamiflu within the first two days of symptoms can help your child get better faster.Also check with your provider sooner if your child has any underlying health conditions, such as:Cancer.Heart conditions.Immune deficiency.Lung diseases, like asthma or cystic fibrosis.Respiratory infections are common in childhood. While you can take steps to reduce your child’s risk, you can’t avoid them entirely. If your child is sick, keep them home to reduce the spread of infection to others in your community. As they recover, your child will develop immunity that will help protect them from future infections.AdvertisementLearn more about our editorial process.Health LibraryFlu (Influenza)OverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionHealth LibraryFlu (Influenza)OverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionAdvertisementRelated ArticlesNovember 11, 2024/Infectious DiseaseFLiRT COVID Variants: What To KnowThe latest omicron subvariants carry specific mutations that may allow the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be better at evading immune protectionNovember 7, 2024/Infectious DiseaseCan COVID-19 Cause Erectile Dysfunction?Research shows the virus can affect your ability to get or maintain an erectionNovember 1, 2024/Children's HealthHere’s How Many Hours Teens Should SleepThe need for sleep often takes a back seat for teens, but they need eight to 10 hours of sleep to stay mentally healthy, strengthen their brains and prevent injuryOctober 29, 2024/Children's HealthRSV vs. Pneumonia: Sorting out Your Child’s Fever and CoughRSV can lead your child to develop pneumonia and have trouble breathingOctober 28, 2024/Children's HealthWhen Can Babies Have Juice?No juice until your child is 1 year old — and even then, they shouldn’t have much, if any October 25, 2024/Children's HealthDoes Your Child Have RSV?

Pediatricians share what to expect fall 2023As the school year approaches, here's what illnesses pediatricians expect to circulate in classrooms this fall and how to keep kids healthy. Aug. 1, 2023, 8:38 PM UTC / Updated Sept. 15, 2023, 3:44 PM UTC / Source: TODAYBy Caroline KeeThe 2023-2024 school year has officially started in the United States, and so has respiratory virus season. There will be no shortage of nasty bugs circulating in classrooms and sickening kids this fall.Last year, the country saw a rebound of several seasonal viruses after a pandemic lull. A surge in respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, among babies and young children last fall led to an explosion in hospitalizations, overwhelming children's hospitals around the country, TODAY.com previously reported. A simultaneous wave of COVID-19 and an unusually early and severe influenza season last fall created a triple threat of respiratory viruses or "tripledemic" that lasted well into winter. As fall approaches, health officials are already preparing for another possible tripledemic of COVID-19, RSV and flu in the U.S., Dr. Mandy Cohen, the new director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, previously told NBC News.Recently, there was a summer increase in COVID infections and hospitalizations around the country. In August, a school in Kentucky had to close less than two weeks into the school year after one-fifth of its students came down with COVID, strep or the flu.Now that many respiratory viruses and diseases are settling back into their pre-pandemic seasonal patterns and people have returned to pre-pandemic behaviors, what can we expect to see this fall and winter among children?Will there be a tripledemic this fall? It’s still too early to tell exactly how this fall and winter will play out compared to last year and how another tripledemic could impact children, experts note. "There remains the possibility of a tripledemic as RSV, influenza and COVID-19 cases increase in various places globally," Dr. Thomas Murray, associate medical director for infection prevention at Yale New Haven Children’s Hospital in Connecticut, tells TODAY.com."I think there are two wildcards that are going to be very important to watch," says Murray. The first is whether or not there will be a major fall resurgence of COVID. "When it comes back, it tends to affect the other respiratory viruses," Murray adds.The second wildcard is how the RSV vaccine for older adults and the newly approved monoclonal antibody injection for children under 2 will affect RSV transmission, says Murray. Clinical trial data suggests that good uptake of these could reduce hospitalizations, he adds.Regardless, there are a number of illnesses that parents can always count on circulating among children once school is back in session. Parents should not panic, but be aware of these common classroom contagions, various symptoms and how to keep kids healthy.Strep throat"No matter which region you are in, the first thing we tend to see as pediatricians is strep throat," Dr. Victoria Regan, a pediatric specialist at Memorial Hermann in Houston, tells TODAY.com.Strep throat is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the throat and tonsils caused by group A streptococcus bacteria, and it’s most common among children and teens, per the CDC. Strep is spread between people through respiratory droplets, and it can flourish in classrooms when children are in close contact, Regan adds.Strep can occur at any time of year, but peak season is usually from December to April, says Regan. During the spring of 2023, there was an “explosion” in strep among children, and pediatricians around the country continued to see a high number of strep cases through the summer months, the experts note.“It’s definitely something parents should be on the lookout for, especially with the increased numbers that we’ve seen,” Dr. Shannon Godsil, pediatrician at Omaha Children’s Hospital & Medical Center, tells TODAY.com. Strep throat symptoms include a sore or scratchy throat; red, swollen tonsils; fever; pain with swallowing; and headaches or body aches, per the Mayo Clinic. This spring, there were reports of children presenting with unusual strep symptoms, including congestion and cough, TODAY.com previously reported.Testing is key, because strep can be treated with antibiotics and symptoms tend to improve within two days of starting medication, Regan notes. If left untreated, strep can lead to complications like abscesses, ear or sinus infections, or rheumatic fever.COVID-19"As frustrating as it is that we might be seeing COVID every year, I think that’s probably our new normal," says Godsil.Coronavirus infections and hospitalizations have been on the rise across the U.S. in recent weeks. Since school has been back in session, many pediatricians have seen an uptick in pediatric COVID cases, according to Regan and Murray. “The exact numbers are difficult to know for sure because most testing is at home antigen testing and not reported,” says Murray. Additionally, the CDC stopped tracking new COVID cases when the federal public health emergency ended in May 2023."Fortunately, in the pediatric population, it is not causing an increase in hospitalizations," says Regan. The intensity of a COVID surge this fall may depend on the severity and contagiousness of emerging variants, says Murray.The dominant COVID strains circulating in the U.S. right now are the EG.5 or “Eris” subvariant, followed by F.L.1.5.1 (aka “Fornax”), and XBB.1.16 or “Arcturus," according to CDC data. These are all descendants of the omicron XBB lineage and close relatives of XBB.1.5, the strain targeted in the new COVID-19 booster, TODAY.com reported previously."The SARS-CoV-2 virus has the potential to mutate further," Godsil adds, so there is a chance this fall will bring an entirely new strain. Since July, scientists have been monitoring a highly mutated variant called BA.2.86, aka “Pirola," but recent data suggests it may not be as contagious or immune-evasive than previously thought. While it's unclear what COVID-19 will look like this fall and winter, especially among kids, vaccination is key, the experts note. The CDC recommends the updated booster for all children ages 6 months and older to protect against serious outcomes from COVID-19. It should be available nationwide by mid-September. Data show the vaccine is safe, effective and has fewer side effects than if a child gets COVID-19, says Regan. "No children have died from the COVID vaccine, but we do have children that die from COVID.""If a child does test positive, they should stay home for at least five days, and masking is recommended for older children the next five days ... until there are two negative tests," says Regan.Respiratory syncytial virus or RSV"Even before COVID, RSV was always a really worrisome thing for pediatricians in the fall," says Godsil. RSV is a common respiratory virus among children that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms, per the CDC. It can also cause wheezing and breathing difficulties, especially in children with underlying lung diseases. In severe cases, it can lead to complications like pneumonia, Regan notes, adding, "It is the No. 1 reason for infant admissions."In the U.S., RSV season typically lasts from October to March. Last fall, RSV hit many parts of the U.S. much earlier than expected. "We saw a significant national increase in RSV cases and hospitalizations compared to prior years," Dr. Karen Acker, pediatric infectious disease specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medicine, tells TODAY.com.“It was intense, and kids were very sick,” says Murray.Last year's RSV surge was likely due to a combination of dropping COVID precautions and increased social mixing. Additionally, many babies and young children were more vulnerable because their immune systems had not been exposed to seasonal viruses during the pandemic, TODAY.com previously reported. "It seems we are still trying to establish what the new seasonal trends will be," says Murray. While it's still too early to tell exactly how this RSV season will pan out, it is underway — and there have already been increases in RSV hospitalizations in Florida and Georgia, Regan notes.On Sept. 5, the CDC issued a health advisory warning about increases in RSV activity in parts of the Southeastern U.S. in recent weeks. "We anticipate seeing an increase in RSV cases this fall and winter," says Acker.There is no specific treatment for RSV, but supportive care is recommended while the virus runs its course, which usually takes about one week. Fortunately, the FDA has approved a new preventative RSV treatment, a monoclonal antibody injection."It is recommended by the CDC, ACIP and AAP for all infants up to age 8 months of age during RSV season and higher risk children up to age 2," says Regan. Studies have shown the injection is safe and decreases the rate of hospitalizations for infants by up to 80%, she adds. It should become available later this month.“If there’s high uptake and if it works as well as it did in the clinical trials, that could have a significant impact on the number of babies coming through our emergency room with RSV," says Murray.A new RSV vaccine is also available for pregnant individuals (to prevent RSV in newborns), and individuals ages 60 and older. If a child has RSV, "parents should reach out to their pediatrician or go to their local emergency room if they see any signs of respiratory distress or dehydration," says Acker. InfluenzaEvery year, parents can count on influenza keeping kids out of school. "We are starting to see flu B in our pediatric population (in Texas)," says Regan. Flu cases are expected to increase in October and November, Acker adds.The flu is a highly contagious viral infection that causes mild to severe illness, per the CDC, and flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, stuffy nose, body aches, fatigue and chills. Most kids will recover on their own, but prescription flu antivirals like Tamiflu can limit disease severity.The 2022 to 2023 season was one of the earliest and most severe flu seasons the U.S. has seen in a long time, TODAY.com previously reported. It's too early to tell what this year's season will look like, the experts note, but there are some worrisome signs.Australia's flu season, which runs from April to September, is often a harbinger of what to expect in the U.S. in the fall. This summer, Australia had heavy flu season, says Regan. "We're anticipating ours to be a little rough again this year," she adds. “Influenza has always been cyclical, and there are good years and bad years depending on the kind of strain that is circulating and how well it matches what’s in the influenza vaccine,” says Murray. Regardless, it’s crucial to get kids vaccinated, he adds, because even during a less severe flu season, children can get very sick. "Unfortunately, there are children who die from influenza every year, including healthy kids with no underlying diseases," says Godsil.The seasonal flu shot is safe and effective for everyone ages 6 months and older. The experts recommend children get the shot in September or October. "Get it by Halloween," says Godsil. Colds and other virusesEvery fall, parents can expect to see the usual gamut of viruses that cause cold symptoms, like congestion, sneezing, runny nose, headache and cough, the experts note. These include but are not limited to rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza and hMPV.Rhinovirus is the most common cause of colds among children and has continued to circulate in high numbers in recent years, says Murray. Less often, it can lead to hospitalizations.Another common cause of respiratory illness among kids are human parainfluenza viruses, Murray adds. In addition to cold symptoms, parainfluenza can present in babies as croup, which causes the airways to swell and create a “barking” cough, Murray says.Non-polio enteroviruses can also cause mild respiratory illness, Murray adds, and cases tend to ramp up in the late summer and fall.The vast majority of children who get the common cold will recover on their own within a week and do not need treatment, the experts note. “For a lot of these respiratory viruses, it’s just supportive care, providing fluids, and close monitoring to make sure breathing is not getting worse,” says Murray.PinkeyeParents can also expect to see more pinkeye this fall, says Godsil, which can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Symptoms typically include redness, watering, itching or discharge in one or both eyes. Pinkeye infections are highly contagious, Godsil notes. Young children often have trouble keeping their hands to themselves and out of their faces, which makes it easy for pinkeye to run rampant through day cares and schools.Viral pinkeye is often preceded by a cold or respiratory illness, such as COVID-19. It will clear up along with cold symptoms on its own, says Godsil, whereas bacterial pinkeye is treated with antibiotic eyedrops or ointment.“There’s lots of factors that help us decide whether it is probably bacterial or viral,” Godsil adds, which is why it’s important to consult a health care provider if a child has pinkeye symptoms.Stomach virusesAnother common — and very unpleasant — illness that keeps kids out of school every year is gastroenteritis, or an inflammation of the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, which causes vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps, the experts note.Often called "stomach flu" or "stomach bug," the viruses that cause gastrointestinal illness are highly contagious and can spread like wildfire through classrooms and among families at home.Norovirus, the most common viral cause of gastroenteritis, surged this past winter and spring around the country, TODAY.com previously reported.Most children will recover on their own at home with supportive care. Hydration and rest are key, the experts note. "Stomach-related viruses tend to last three to five days, and children tend to do quite well," says Regan. How to keep children healthyChildren should get vaccinated when possible, the experts emphasize. This includes the required vaccines to enter school, such as polio, chickenpox, and the MMR shot, as well as recommended vaccines, like the flu shot and COVID-19 booster, which are safe to get at the same time.Beyond vaccination, the experts recommend teaching children to practice routine hand-washing (for at least 30 seconds with soap and water), to avoid touching their faces with unwashed hands, and to cover coughs or sneezes.Cleaning contaminated surfaces and improving ventilation indoors can also stem the spread of bugs in the classroom. "Masking remains an option for those who are worried about their own health or want to prevent the spread to others," says Murray."If your child is sick, keep them home, whether that be from school, a party or a sports game," says Godsil, adding that children can return to school once their symptoms have resolved.Sending children to school sick can delay their recovery and infect classmates, says Regan. "It really does pay to keep your child home a couple days and get them fully recovered before they return to school."Caroline KeeCaroline Kee is a health reporter at TODAY based in New York City.RelatedGetty Images/iStockphotoThese are the best cold remedies according to doctorsCold & Flu / Updated Nov. 8, 2024Mindful Media / Getty ImagesHow to make yourself sneeze, according to doctorsCold & Flu / Updated Oct. 15, 2024Getty ImagesAre your fall allergy symptoms worse this year?

Is there anything different about this year’s flu shot?Should I get the flu shot every year?What types of flu vaccinations are available this year? With the end of summer comes cold and flu season. Around this time each year pharmacies and doctors’ offices across the country start advertising vaccination clinics where people can get a flu shot to better protect themselves and their loved ones from the influenza virus. But figuring out when to get the flu shot, and perhaps even more important, the best time to get the flu shot, can be tricky. Ahead, healthcare experts explain when to get your flu shot and answer all of your questions about the 2023 flu vaccine.When to get the flu shotWhile you may not be excited about adding another item to your already busy fall to-do list, Vicent Hsu, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and infection control officer for AdventHealth, says that the best time to get your flu shot is as soon as it becomes available in your area. Typically, the shots become available in September or October, just as cold and flu season begins to rear its ugly head. “Even if you miss that window, you will still get protection by getting vaccinated anytime during the flu season, which generally peaks between December and February and can last up to May,” he explains.Although Dr. Hsu says you can’t really be too late when getting your shot since it will still give you some protection even if done later than recommended, Christina Madison, Pharm.D., F.C.C.P, Founder and CEO of The Public Health Pharmacist says there is such thing as being too early. “Vaccination is not recommended in July and August,” she says, adding that you really should try to get it done before October 31st.Who should get the flu shot?Everyone over six months old should get a flu vaccine, according to our experts. There are very few exceptions to that list, according to Dr. Hsu, who notes that patients who have had previous severe allergic reactions to the vaccination are among the few who can consider skipping it.“There are different vaccines for different age groups, so your provider will give you the vaccine that is appropriate for your age group,” he continues. “People 65 and older are recommended to get the high-dose formulation. If you have any questions about which vaccine you should be getting, it’s best to ask your doctor.” The recommendations for the opposite end of that spectrum, like children under the age of eight, varies a bit according to Mark W. Kline, M.D., pediatrician, and infectious diseases specialist who serves as the physician-in-chief at Children’s Hospital New Orleans. “Children six months to eight years of age who are receiving the flu vaccine for the first time will need two doses of the vaccine,” he says, explaining that vaccination at this age can reduce the risk of illness, hospitalization, and death in children. “It also helps prevent transmission of influenza to family and friends, including infants less than six months of age who are too young to be vaccinated.”When will this year’s flu shot be available? The vaccine is already commercially available for the 2023-2024 cold and flu season, according to both Dr. Hsu and Madison, which means the clock has already started ticking when it comes to their recommended window of opportunity. Is there anything different about this year’s flu shot?Although the influenza vaccine always contains 2A and 2B strains, Dr. Hsu says the strain compositions for this season are different from previous years based on what is circulating. This is part of the reason why he says it’s so important to get your annual vaccination since each year you’ll be given a different formula that will target the most likely strains for the year. Another change this year has to do with the end of recommendations for those with food allergies. “Also, this year the CDC has stated that any patients with egg allergy can receive any egg-based or nonegg-based vaccine without need for special monitoring,” Dr. Hsu continues. Madison says there will also be egg-free formulations and dosing recommendations “specifically for seniors and immunocompromised persons” this year. “All of the influenza vaccines will be available as a quadrivalent vaccine for 2023-2024.”Should I get the flu shot every year?Yes. The virus strains that cause the flu are constantly changing, Dr. Hsu says, so the vaccines are updated from one season to the next to try and prevent illness in as many people as possible. “Also, the protection the vaccine provides declines over time, so getting a shot every year re-ups that protection,” Dr. Hsu says.What types of flu vaccinations are available this year? People will have access to two different vaccination methods this year, according to the experts. “The injectable vaccine is available for children and adults six months of age or older,” Dr. Kline says. “A nasal spray vaccine is available for people two to 49 years of age.”While many people may prefer skipping the shot in favor of the nasal spray, it’s not for everyone. “People who are pregnant, children two to four years of age with asthma or wheezing, people with weakened immune systems, and those with a variety of other medical conditions should not get the nasal spray vaccine,” Dr. Kline says. If you’re unsure of what will be the best option for you, Dr. Kline suggests consulting your doctor for recommendations.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowFlu Season7 Ways to Get Over the Flu FasterCan You Get Your COVID and Flu Shots at Once?FDA Approves New Home Flu VaccineCDC Warns About Flu Deaths in KidsAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowAt-Home Flu Vaccine May Be Available Next YearThis Is How Long the Flu Is ContagiousFlu Shot Side Effects You Should KnowWhen Will Flu Season Start and End This Year?5 Myths About Colds and Flu, DebunkedWhat Is the Deadly H3N2 Flu?This Is the Most Effective Way to Prevent the FluU.S. Flu Activity Is up 23%Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAbout Prevention.comNewsletterPress RoomGive A GiftCommunity GuidelinesSubscribeMedia KitAdvertise OnlineOther Hearst SubscriptionsCustomer ServiceA Part of Hearst Digital MediaWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.©2024 Hearst Magazines, Inc.

Doctors performed CPR, and the teen was airlifted to the pediatric ICU at Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, where he was immediately put on life support treatment."He was so close to not surviving," Dr. Katie Boyle, who led the boy's care team, told USA TODAY. "We put him on (life support) with the hope that he would survive, but knowing that his chances of survival were lower than his chances of dying from the illness."Mathias was diagnosed with pneumonia and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, a rare and rapidly developing bacterial infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Toxic shock syndrome affects about three to six people per 100,000 each year, said Erin Clark, an associate professor at the University of Utah Health in 2018. The specific infection that has kept Mathias in the hospital for months is even rarer than that.After roughly two weeks of life support treatment for all his vital organs, doctors removed the treatment from his heart and lungs. He began showing improvements. Some days later, his respirator was taken out.On July 20, doctors told the family that the boy's organs were saved; however, his extremities were not. His hands and legs "did not receive enough blood flow" and had to be amputated.“It was clear that the tissue wasn't going to survive,” Boyle said.For nearly half of people who get the rare bacterial disease, experts don't know how the bacteria got into the body, according to the CDC. The bacteria can sometimes enter the body through openings in the skin, such as an injury or surgical wound, or through mucus membranes, including the skin inside the nose and throat, the CDC says. Out of 10 people with the infection, as many as three people will die from it.Boyle said she sees cases of the rare disease at the Tennessee hospital a few times each year. Often, and including for Mathias, the bacterial infection complicates the flu."What the flu can do is cause injury to your airway and your lungs, and then these bacteria that we often come in contact with and can fight off can start to somehow find a way to grow before your immune system fights them off," she said.Her advice to parents was to bring children to a doctor if fever symptoms have lasted over a week and are worsening, especially if the child is having trouble breathing, has really cool skin, or is hard to wake up. To lessen the risk of the rare infectious disease, Boyle said to wash hands often and clean and bandage wounds.Mathias, an avid soccer and basketball fan with dreams of attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has been resilient through what will be the start of a long medical journey, his family said."Our brilliant, 14-year-old son is a fighter," they wrote on GoFundMe. "Our son has always been a happy, tender, loving boy, who touches the heart of everyone around him."The fundraiser, titled "#MiracleforMathias," has raised close to $245,000 as of Thursday morning. Donations will go toward the bills for Mathias' treatment, including life-long prosthetics and a variety of therapies."He has faced adversity with unwavering courage, and we have no doubt that he will continue to do so throughout this journey," the Uribe family said. "We are in awe of his unwavering spirit and determination, which will undoubtedly guide him through the challenges that lie ahead."

Additional information can be found at www.clevelandclinic.org/fluPatients can schedule a flu clinic appointment by phone or online via MyChart now. Patients can also receive the flu vaccine at most scheduled in-person office visits with a physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant. In addition, patients can call their primary care physician’s office to schedule a flu vaccination appointment with a nurse.“Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory infection that leads to thousands of hospitalizations every year. It can result in severe illness and should not be taken lightly,” said Steven Gordon, M.D., chair of the Department of Infectious Disease at Cleveland Clinic. “Annual vaccination is the most effective method to prevent the spread of influenza and is the best way to keep ourselves and our communities healthy during respiratory virus season.”Hospitals are preparing for an influx of flu, COVID-19 and RSV as the fall respiratory virus season begins. With the potential for these three viruses circulating at the same time, it is important to receive vaccinations to reduce your risk of infection.Later this fall, Cleveland Clinic plans to offer the new RSV vaccine for adults aged 60 years and older. Patients should discuss with their doctor if they should receive the vaccine. Patients can also still get vaccinated for COVID-19 at many scheduled primary care and specialty appointments. A newly updated COVID-19 booster is anticipated to be available this fall.Annual flu vaccinations are recommended for everyone six months and older, but they’re particularly important for those who are at a higher risk of severe complications. These groups include young children, adults aged 65 and older, pregnant women, individuals with chronic medical conditions and those with compromised immune systems. By getting vaccinated, individuals not only protect themselves but also contribute to community immunity, reducing the overall impact of the flu season.In addition to vaccination, preventive measures like wearing masks, practicing good hand hygiene, social distancing and staying home when sick can further help reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses.The flu is contagious and can cause serious respiratory infection. The timing of seasonal flu activity can vary, but most typically occurs between October and May, and usually peaks between December and February. Vaccination and preventive measures can help alleviate hospitalizations during peak flu and respiratory virus season.Common symptoms of the flu include fever, dry cough, headache, sore throat, chills, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite.About Cleveland ClinicCleveland Clinic is a nonprofit multispecialty academic medical center that integrates clinical and hospital care with research and education.

Edited By: Kristina Das New Delhi Published on: September 16, 2023 15:24 IST URL copied Follow us on Image Source : FREEPIK Major ways to prevent Influenza among children. Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a highly contagious respiratory illness that primarily affects children. Influenza can cause mild to severe symptoms and can even lead to hospitalisation or death. Symptoms of influenza in children may include fever, chills, cough, runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, body aches, headache, fatigue, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea. It is important for parents to be aware of the signs and symptoms of influenza in their children so they can seek medical attention if necessary. Vaccines are available to help protect children from becoming infected with the flu virus. It is also important to practice good hygiene such as frequent handwashing to reduce the spread of the virus. However, we often blame it on the dip in temperature or fluctuations in humidity and don’t take them seriously. But, in children, these symptoms even if brought on by weather change should not be ignored because they could be a sign of flu. The flu virus spreads faster as the temperature fluctuates during monsoons and winter. So, the months between September and November are called the ‘flu season’ in India. Children need all the protection possible during this season to prevent the complications of the flu. Studies have shown that children under 5 years of age are 7 times more likely to be hospitalised because of flu. Even in uncomplicated cases, children may take 8-10 days to recover. No parent wants this kind of suffering for their children. A UNICEF report titled The State of the World’s Children 2023: For Every Child, Vaccinationshowsthat 67 million children missed out on one or more vaccinations over three years (2019-2021) due to service disruption caused by strained health systems and diversion of scarce resources, conflict and fragility, and decreased confidence. However, according to new statistics released by the World Health Organization and UNICEF, fewer children around the world missed receiving routine vaccinations in 2022 compared to the year before, indicating a rebound in childhood immunizations following the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are three ways Dr. Abhishek Chatterjee from Anav Child Care, New Delhi suggests to contain the spread of flu and protect children against its complications. Get your children vaccinated against the flu As the adage goes, ‘better safe than sorry,’ vaccination may ensure the safety of children against severe flu complications and is recommended in the guidelines on childhood immunisation issued by the Indian Academy of Paediatrics. One vaccination shot is needed every year for children between 6 months and 5 years of age. This is because there are four types of flu viruses and they are ‘shapeshifters. They change form each year and the annual flu vaccination is developed to counter these. Ensure that you and your children follow basic hygiene measures Basic hygiene gives an extra layer of protection against flu and helps to halt or prevent its spread. Flu viruses may spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks in places where others are present. Children may catch the flu if they come in close contact with other infected children or adults. Since the flu virus can live on solid surfaces, they can catch it if they even touch a contaminated surface. This is why children must be taught to wash their hands frequently with soap and water. It is also necessary to sanitize the toys and other articles that they use often. Don’t send children to school or outdoors if they show any symptoms of flu Symptoms may appear even before the child is diagnosed with flu. This means they may transmit the infection to others. Keep them at home for a few days or till your paediatrician clears them to go to school. This helps to prevent the spread of the flu. Parents must be vigilant and break this chain of transmission by taking the necessary safety precautions.

And, as was the case in previous years, you’ll have the option to get this booster and your usual flu vaccine at the same appointment.We are still in the midst of a summer COVID-19 wave, and “I’m anticipating that will continue,” Dr. William Werbel, assistant professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, tells TODAY.com. So it makes sense to consider getting an updated shot soon, especially before the winter holiday season.But, he adds, “2023 is not the same as 2020 by any stretch.” While rates of hospitalization and death due to COVID-19 are up right now, "We're not even half of where we were last year, and we're not even a fifth of where we were in 2021," Dr. Krystina L. Woods, hospital epidemiologist and medical director of infection prevention at Mount Sinai West, tells TODAY.com.So far, other illnesses — such as the flu and respiratory syncytial virus are appearing at lower levels, Dr. Thomas Murray, associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the Yale School of Medicine, tells TODAY.com. “This is the very beginning of the typical respiratory season, but certainly we’ve got evidence that the viruses are circulating," he says.To get the most protection, experts recommend getting vaccinated ahead of the peak of respiratory virus season. And, depending on your schedule, it might make the most sense to get multiple vaccines in one appointment.Most people who get both their COVID-19 and flu shots at once aren't likely to get significantly more side effects or — more severe side effects — than they would if they'd only gotten one vaccine or the other, experts tell TODAY.com.But side effects are possible and can be unpleasant for a day or two, the experts say, so it's smart to think ahead, plan your appointment well and be prepared to not feel your best for a little while.Who should get an updated COVID-19 vaccine?Everyone ages 6 months and older should get the new COVID-19 vaccine this fall, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week. Kids under 5 may be eligible to receive two doses of the new vaccine if they haven't been vaccinated previously.The new COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are designed to protect against the XBB.1.5 coronavirus variant, which is a subvariant of omicron that was spreading widely this past winter. “What we’re seeing is that the circulating variants are descendants of that line, so we have reason to believe it will work well,” Woods explains. The new vaccines also appear to provide protection against newer strains including EG.5 and BA.2.86, the Food and Drug Administration says. "We're not seeing levels of hospitalization like we've seen in earlier waves; however, we are still seeing people hospitalized," Murray says. "So we do think there is benefit from the updated vaccine that provides coverage against strains that are more closely related to what's circulating."For some people, getting an updated COVID-19 booster is especially urgent. People with certain chronic health issues, such as diabetes, obesity or lung, heart, liver or kidney diseases should certainly consider getting the new COVID-19 vaccine, Werbel says. Additionally, older adults, people with compromised immune systems and people who are pregnant are also at a higher risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms and should consider getting the booster, Woods says.Should young, healthy people get the updated booster?The CDC’s latest recommendation is that everyone who’s at least 6 months age should get an updated COVID-19 vaccine to protect them through this fall and winter season. That includes low-risk individuals who received their previous COVID-19 vaccine doses at least two months ago."There is some room for a reasonable debate about what the added value is for an annual vaccine for someone who is young and healthy," Woods says. "On the flip side, we know that people who were vaccinated and who don't get COVID or severe COVID are more likely to not get long COVID."Even if you're young, healthy and had previous vaccines or COVID-19 infections, "you have a very minimal risk that (you're) going to have bad luck," Werbel says, which could mean ending up in the hospital or with long COVID. "And you can't always control for luck," he says. There are also societal factors to keep in mind, the experts say, particularly as we approach the winter holiday season. "If you are going to Thanksgiving with Nana, she's not you," Werbel says. "Even though you've had prior vaccines or COVID, you can get sick and you can get Nana sick."This is where other protective habits can come in handy during times of heightened COVID-19 activity, Woods says, including wearing a mask in crowded public settings, opting for outdoor gatherings when the weather allows and stocking up on at-home tests just in case."It's not fair to assume that everyone's risk tolerance is the same as whatever yours is," she explains. You can't necessarily tell if people around you have risk factors for severe COVID-19 simply by looking at them, Woods says, "so I think it's still important for us all to be responsible and realize that we don't live on an island."When should I get my COVID-19 booster and flu shot?In order to get the most effective protection from the vaccine, you'll need to give your body "time to build that added new antibody response from the vaccine," Woods says. Generally, the experts say, you can expect to develop effective antibody protection about two weeks after getting the vaccine. And you'll get the most protection against COVID-19 infection in the first few months after getting the shot, Werbel says."If somebody is vaccinated by early November, they should feel comfortable that their vaccine is working to its maximum effect (by winter holiday season)," Woods says. “You don’t want to get it the day before Thanksgiving thinking it’s going to help protect grandma the next day."Keep in mind, though, that you may want to wait two to three months after a previous COVID-19 vaccine or infection, Werbel says. That's not because it's dangerous to get them too close together, but because you'll get some protection from the previous dose or infection, so you probably don't need another dose yet.Similarly, the CDC typically recommends that people get their flu vaccine by the end of October because flu season usually starts to pick up in November. But because seasonal virus trends have been "a bit strange" the past few years, Werbel says he'll be keeping an eye on the CDC's Flu View resource to monitor for an uptick in cases before getting his flu shot this year.Can I get my COVID-19 booster and flu vaccine at the same time?Yes, you can get your flu shot at the same time as your updated COVID-19 booster. "Studies conducted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic indicate that it is safe to get both a flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same visit," according to the official guidance from the CDC. One of the big reasons for that is just simple convenience, Murray says. This way, you don't need to make multiple visits, or you can get them both done while you happen to be shopping at your local pharmacy without needing to come back. If getting these two vaccines at once is the only practical way you're going to get them both before the peak season hits, it makes sense to do so, the experts say.But if you recently had another COVID-19 vaccine or a COVID-19 infection, you may need to wait on your updated booster. The CDC recommends waiting at least until your isolation period is over and, potentially, up to three months after a recent infection.Even if you or your child had COVID-19 within the last few months, you can still get the flu shot now and the updated booster later. And if you're not sure what makes the most sense for you, check with your doctor. Will I get more side effects if I get them at the same time?The research we have so far suggests that people don't necessarily get more intense side effects if they get these two vaccines together, Woods says. "This isn't a 'one plus one equals two' kind of a thing," she says. "It just has to do with your immune response building up, and people are very individual."A CDC study published last summer found that people who got both their flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine at the same time experienced slightly more side effects — an increase of 8% to 11% — than those who got just their COVID-19 booster on its own. Specifically, people who got both vaccines reported more fatigue, headaches and muscle aches than those who just got one.People can feel "crummier," Werbel says, but there's no data to suggest that having the two together can make severe reactions to the vaccine more likely, such as allergic reactions or heart issues. If you're considering getting the two together, think about how you felt last time and how you usually feel after getting vaccines. Last year, if you felt really unwell following your vaccines, that might be how you feel this year — and it could be a good reason to get them separately this time around, Woods says. To make things a little more bearable, the CDC suggests getting one shot in each arm or, if you're getting them in the same limb, to get them at least an inch apart. In the event that you have a more severe reaction to one vaccine or the other, this will also help keep track of which one it was, Murray explains. Here are the most common potential side effects of each, according to the CDC. Common COVID-19 booster side effects:Pain, swelling and redness at the injection siteFever ChillsHeadacheMuscle achesFatigueNauseaCommon flu shot side effects:Redness, soreness and swelling around the injection siteFeverNauseaHeadacheFatigueMuscle achesHow to prepare for booster and flu shot side effects:First, plan ahead. Try to schedule your vaccines for when you don't have much going on in the following day or two, just in case you need to lay low due to side effects. "So if you have a big meeting at work or your child is in sports and has a big game, that's probably not the day to go get the vaccine," Murray said. If you're in pain after your shots, take over-the-counter pain medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Guidance on this might vary because there are "some theoretical concerns" that taking a medication like this could affect how well your immune system responds to the vaccine, Murray said. But if you're feeling significant side effects like arm soreness, fever, headache or muscle aches, the experts agree that it's reasonable to manage those with OTC medication. (But you should not take those medications before getting your shots, the CDC says.)The CDC also suggests gently using or exercising the arm that's sore and applying a cool compress to ease soreness and swelling. And Woods recommends using a warm compress or letting warm water run over your sore arm in the shower or bath.There are a few potentially serious (but rare) side effects, like allergic reactions, that require medical attention. And if you're experiencing side effects for more than three days, you should check in with your doctor.But, for the most part, think of those side effects as signs that your vaccines are kicking in and that your body is doing its job to keep you safe.

These search tools allow for finding shots for flu, COVID-19 and other illnesses.COVID rules: COVID is back in NY. What to know about schools, nursing homes and moreThe new COVID-19 vaccines are proving effective at limiting serious illnesses from all COVID variants currently circulating. These vaccines are new formulations produced by Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna and provide much-needed added protection beyond prior booster doses, experts said.Sandra Lindsay, a Northwell Health nurse in New York, on Wednesday became the first American to receive a dose of Pfizer’s new formulation for this fall and winter. Lindsay previously got the first COVID-19 vaccine dose in 2020.Should NY still worry about long COVID? How many long COVID cases in NY? Is it still a threat? Here's what we know (and don't)Who should get new COVID-19 vaccine?Federal regulators recommended all Americans ages six months and older should get a dose of one of the new COVID-19 vaccines this fall and winter. Americans should only get this new dose at least two months after getting a prior COVID-19 vaccine.Can I get a flu vaccine and COVID vaccine at the same time?Yes, flu vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines can be given at the same visit if you are due for both vaccines.Who should get RSV vaccine?CDC recommends adults 60 years and older may receive a single dose of RSV vaccine, based on discussions between the patient and health care provider.RSV vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, CDC says.When is flu season?Flu season usually occurs in the fall and winter. While influenza viruses spread year-round, most of the time flu activity peaks between December and February, CDC says.The overall health impact (e.g., infections, hospitalizations, and deaths) of flu varies from season to season.When should you get a flu vaccine?September and October remain the best times for most people to get their flu vaccine, according to the CDC.For most people, it's not recommended to get a flu vaccination in July or August.Historic jab: Meet Sandra Lindsay, the first COVID-19 vaccine recipient in the U.S.It’s further suggested in the report that vaccination should continue after October and throughout the given flu season since “influenza activity might not occur in certain communities until February, March, or later.” The CDC also recommends vaccination "as long as flu viruses pose a threat."The report says the start, peak and decline of each flu season cannot be predicted and the ideal time to start vaccination can change.Experts note it typically takes two weeks for antibodies to build up post vaccination, making it important to get shots prior to infections rising high levels. The same principle goes for getting vaccinated at least two weeks prior to traveling to get optimal protection during a trip.What do new COVID vaccines cost?Drug makers will charge upwards of $100 per dose of COVID-19 vaccines going forward, but many health insurance plans will cover that entire cost (depending on coverage network specifics). And the federal "Bridge Access Program" will continue to provide free COVID-19 vaccine doses to uninsured Americans this fall.USA TODAY contributed to this report Facebook Twitter EmailShare your feedback to help improve our site!HelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © Copyright Gannett 2024Covid, RSV, flu vaccines: How to decide whether to get them togetherSkip NavigationMarketsPre-MarketsU.S. MarketsEurope MarketsChina MarketsAsia MarketsWorld MarketsCurrenciesCryptocurrencyFutures & CommoditiesBondsFunds & ETFsBusinessEconomyFinanceHealth & ScienceMediaReal EstateEnergyClimateTransportationIndustrialsRetailWealthSportsLifeSmall BusinessInvestingPersonal FinanceFintechFinancial AdvisorsOptions ActionETF StreetBuffett ArchiveEarningsTrader TalkTechCybersecurityEnterpriseInternetMediaMobileSocial MediaCNBC Disruptor 50Tech GuidePoliticsWhite HousePolicyDefenseCongressEquity and OpportunityEurope PoliticsChina PoliticsAsia PoliticsWorld PoliticsVideoLatest VideoFull EpisodesLivestreamTop VideoLive AudioEurope TVAsia TVCNBC PodcastsCEO InterviewsDigital OriginalsWatchlistInvesting ClubTrust PortfolioAnalysisTrade AlertsMeeting VideosHomestretchJim's ColumnsEducationSubscribeSign InPROPro NewsLivestreamFull EpisodesStock ScreenerMarket ForecastOptions InvestingChart InvestingSubscribeSign InLivestreamMenuMake ItselectALL SELECTCredit Cards Loans Banking Mortgages Insurance Credit Monitoring Personal Finance Small Business Taxes Help for Low Credit Scores Investing SELECTAll Credit CardsFind the Credit Card for YouBest Credit CardsBest Rewards Credit CardsBest Travel Credit CardsBest 0% APR Credit CardsBest Balance Transfer Credit CardsBest Cash Back Credit CardsBest Credit Card Welcome BonusesBest Credit Cards to Build CreditSELECTAll LoansFind the Best Personal Loan for YouBest Personal LoansBest Debt Consolidation LoansBest Loans to Refinance Credit Card DebtBest Loans with Fast FundingBest Small Personal LoansBest Large Personal LoansBest Personal Loans to Apply OnlineBest Student Loan RefinanceSELECTAll BankingFind the Savings Account for YouBest High Yield Savings AccountsBest Big Bank Savings AccountsBest Big Bank Checking AccountsBest No Fee Checking AccountsNo Overdraft Fee Checking AccountsBest Checking Account BonusesBest Money Market AccountsBest CDsBest Credit UnionsSELECTAll MortgagesBest MortgagesBest Mortgages for Small Down PaymentBest Mortgages for No Down PaymentBest Mortgages with No Origination FeeBest Mortgages for Average Credit ScoreAdjustable Rate MortgagesAffording a MortgageSELECTAll InsuranceBest Life InsuranceBest Homeowners InsuranceBest Renters InsuranceBest Car InsuranceTravel InsuranceSELECTAll Credit MonitoringBest Credit Monitoring ServicesBest Identity Theft ProtectionHow to Boost Your Credit ScoreCredit Repair ServicesSELECTAll Personal FinanceBest Budgeting AppsBest Expense Tracker AppsBest Money Transfer AppsBest Resale Apps and SitesBuy Now Pay Later (BNPL) AppsBest Debt ReliefSELECTAll Small BusinessBest Small Business Savings AccountsBest Small Business Checking AccountsBest Credit Cards for Small BusinessBest Small Business LoansBest Tax Software for Small BusinessSELECTAll TaxesFiling For FreeBest Tax SoftwareBest Tax Software for Small BusinessesTax RefundsTax BracketsTax TipsTax By StateTax Payment PlansSELECTAll Help for Low Credit ScoresBest Credit Cards for Bad CreditBest Personal Loans for Bad CreditBest Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad CreditPersonal Loans if You Don't Have CreditBest Credit Cards for Building CreditPersonal Loans for 580 Credit Score or LowerPersonal Loans for 670 Credit Score or LowerBest Mortgages for Bad CreditBest Hardship LoansHow to Boost Your Credit ScoreSELECTAll InvestingBest IRA AccountsBest Roth IRA AccountsBest Investing AppsBest Free Stock Trading PlatformsBest Robo-AdvisorsIndex FundsMutual FundsETFsBondsUSAINTLLivestreamSearch quotes, news & videosLivestreamWatchlistSIGN INMarketsBusinessInvestingTechPoliticsVideoWatchlistInvesting ClubPROLivestreamMenuHealth and ScienceCovid, RSV and flu vaccines are now available — here's how to decide whether to get them togetherPublished Fri, Sep 15 20237:07 AM EDTUpdated Fri, Sep 15 20239:59 AM EDTAnnika Kim Constantino@annikakimcWATCH LIVEKey PointsFor the first time ever, vaccines for Covid, the flu and respiratory syncytial virus are now available in the U.S. Most people only need to consider whether they should get the newly approved updated Covid shot and flu vaccine at the same time, which is perfectly safe and effective.Meanwhile, only adults 60 and older are eligible for a new RSV vaccine, which means they have to juggle all three shots this fall.Pharmacist Ani Martirosyan administers an immunization to a patient at a CVS on Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023 in Glendale, CA. Brian Van Der Brug | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesFor the first time ever, vaccines for Covid, the flu and respiratory syncytial virus are available in the U.S. Public health officials are urging eligible Americans to take all three shots so the nation can avoid another "tripledemic" of Covid, flu and RSV, which inundated hospitals last fall and winter. But the fact that some people can now receive three shots has raised questions about whether they should take the jabs all at once or space them out.Most people only need to consider whether they should get an updated Pfizer or Moderna Covid shot and a flu vaccine at the same time, since both are broadly available to all Americans.Public health officials, physicians and recent research show that taking them during the same visit to the doctor or pharmacy is perfectly safe and effective. Meanwhile, the roughly 76.5 million adults ages 60 and older are eligible for a new RSV vaccine from Pfizer or GSK, which means they have to juggle all three shots this fall. A maternal vaccine from Pfizer protects infants against RSV, but that shot isn't available just yet.Health experts told CNBC that they don't expect any issues with taking all three shots at once.Still, other experts note that there is little research on administering an RSV shot with another vaccine, or on giving all three shots together. People can choose to take the RSV jab if they're more comfortable with that, and do the other two at another time. The choice is ultimately up to the individual and what they believe is most ideal for them, and they should feel free to consult their doctors if they're unsure, health experts said. "There hasn't been any evidence that there is any risk of getting all three at the same time," Dr. Ali Alhassani, a physician at Boston Children's Hospital, told CNBC. He noted that administering multiple vaccines isn't unusual since children often receive up to five routine immunizations at once. Similarly, Dr. Andrew Pekosz, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said he doesn't "want people to think there will be any problems with taking them together because there probably isn't."But he also noted that "without data, I don't want to go completely over the top and give a really firm recommendation that everyone should get all three at the same time."The benefits of taking Covid, flu, RSV shots togetherTaking all three shots simultaneously could be ideal for people who may not have the time to make the multiple trips. "By far the biggest benefit of getting all three together is convenience," Alhassani said. Some research even shows that many people don't come back when they have to take a second shot, according to Johns Hopkins' Pekosz. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends two to three doses of an HPV vaccine for certain Americans. But studies have shown that uptake of HPV shots declines between the first and subsequent doses.The U.S. encountered a similar issue during the first Covid vaccine rollout in 2020 and 2021. Many Americans missed their second primary series dose. "It's clear that if people have to go back to the pharmacy on two different occasions, there's always an attrition rate," Pekosz told CNBC. "So, it's better to get them in your arm during the same visit rather than not getting the second one because you get too busy to go back."A nurse prepares a flu shot at Huntington Village Pediatrics, in Huntington, New York on December 8, 2021.Steve Pfost | Newsday | Getty ImagesPharmacies allow Americans to schedule multiple vaccine appointments in one visit. For instance, Kroger's online scheduling tool allows eligible people to select up to three vaccines to take at once.People who use that tool and help from Kroger's clinicians, pharmacists and physician assistants to determine which vaccines are appropriate for them, Dr. Marc Watkins, Kroger Health's chief medical officer, told CNBC. What to do if you want to space vaccines out Some people may prefer to wait for data to come out before they take all three shots together."We don't have too much information about what happens from getting all three vaccines at the same time, so getting the RSV vaccine separately may be a good idea if you are really not sure," said Dr. Janak Patel, director of the department of infection control and healthcare epidemiology at the University of Texas Medical Branch.Others may also choose to take the vaccines at different times for their physical comfort, according to Alhassani from Boston Children's Hospital. One of the most common side effects of getting a vaccine is inflammation or soreness at the injection site, he noted. That's why people who need to take two shots during the same doctor's visit usually get one in each arm. But Alhassani said some people may not want to feel the discomfort of getting three shots at the same time, either in one arm or two. That's especially the case for people who usually engage in activities that require them to move their arms a lot. "If you play sports and have a big game coming up or you're a teacher who writes a lot on the chalkboard or white board, you use your shoulders and arms a lot," he said. "So for practical reasons, you might want to say, 'OK, I only want my left shoulder to be sore today and again next week rather than having it very sore today.'"

Santiago | Getty ImagesIf people do choose to take the three shots separately, they should get their updated Covid vaccine as soon as possible, their RSV shot soon after and their flu jab last, according to Pekosz.He specifically recommended taking them one week apart from each other, saying that with "more space between them, the more likely people aren't going back." Pekosz based the order of the vaccines on how widely those respiratory viruses are currently spreading in the U.S. The updated Covid shot should be the No. 1 priority because the virus is already spreading at higher levels. Covid hospitalizations increased for the seventh straight week in the U.S., hitting 17,418 as of the week ended Aug. 26, according to the latest data from the CDC. RSV cases also are starting to inch up. Last week, the CDC alerted doctors about an increase in RSV activity across some parts of the Southeast. Regional increases have usually predicted the beginning of RSV season nationally, the CDC wrote in an advisory notice. Meanwhile, Pekosz said "we still aren't really seeing any influenza yet." He noted that people can also take their Covid and flu shots at the same time and get their RSV vaccine a week later. "That way, we're following all the science that's out there supporting co-administration," he told CNBC.

CoronavirusSeptember 12, 2023 COVID in 2023: How health experts are handling new vaccines and guidelinesBy Pamela Wu ‘I’m not comfortable without a mask on flights.’ Infectious disease doctors get personal about their habits (SACRAMENTO) COVID infections are expected to rise in fall 2023. Doctors say COVID dangers have not “ended.” They anticipate seeing more patients with COVID symptoms, along with the usual colds, flus and other contagious respiratory illnesses. Should you wear a mask? Or avoid large gatherings? Many people have questions about guidelines for living their daily lives. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children’s Hospital, and Natascha Tuznik, associate clinical professor of infectious diseases, recently shared their thoughts about smart safety protocols in an article for The Washington Post. Here’s what else they said. What illnesses do you expect to see this fall? Tuznik: I am concerned about the increase in patients in the hospital. We expect to see COVID along with the flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Anyone is susceptible to all three, especially those who already have other underlying illnesses and immune system disorders. Blumberg: I expect that there will be the usual increases in winter respiratory viruses, which of course now includes COVID. I do not expect that this will be as bad last year when we saw a “tripledemic.” I’m hoping that was a one-off. The wild card is the possible appearance of new COVID variants that may result in increased transmissibility or immune escape. We are already keeping our eyes on the current variants. What will be your approach to the new COVID booster and flu vaccine? Blumberg: I would like the updated booster as soon as it is available. I’m planning on [getting the] influenza vaccine in October but will be monitoring influenza activity and will get vaccinated sooner if it turns out to be an early flu season. There’s good data on the efficacy of the new RSV vaccines; now I'm looking forward to seeing further data on their safety. Tuznik: The sooner you can boost your immune system, the better. As with all vaccines, they are quite effective at preventing hospitalizations and death. The new RSV vaccines for adults appear to have a relatively safe side-effect profile. They are new – just approved this year. If you are 60 or older, it may be worth discussing the risks and benefits with your doctor. Watch VideoUC Davis Health experts recommend the new COVID booster. Chief of Infectious Diseases Stuart Cohen explains what you should know about this new vaccine. New COVID Variants and a Rise in Cases - What We Know About EG.5 (Eris) and BA.2.86 Close What COVID-safe rules or habits are you following in your own life? Are you going to restaurants and the movie theater? Tuznik: I will keep checking the rates of all three viruses, to see how widespread they are. Based on that, I may take extra precautions. Ever since the pandemic I try to eat outdoors as much as possible and avoid going to movies on opening night. If COVID continues to spike, then I will likely avoid unnecessary indoor environments. Things like restaurant dining, movies and concerts are optional in my opinion. Blumberg: I am continuing with usual activities, including traveling. For now, I am continuing to eat inside restaurants. The most risk of transmission is generally from your immediate dining companions since the waitstaff, and other patrons are usually not very close for very long. If I trust those at my table to be mindful of any symptoms and current with vaccines, then I’m good. If COVID continues to spike, then I will likely avoid unnecessary indoor environments. Things like restaurant dining, movies and concerts are optional in my opinion.”—Natascha Tuznik, associate clinical professor of infectious diseases.Are you still wearing a mask in Fall 2023? Blumberg: I’m a big believer in masking, so I’m comfortable at indoor or outdoor crowded events while I’m masked. I usually use a regular surgical mask for crowded outdoor events, but upgrade to N95 or KN95 if I’m close to people indoors or on a plane. I stopped masking this summer. It felt weird sometimes to be maskless. But with COVID rates increasing, I’m thinking of going back to masking while indoors at stores and other venues. I’ve maintained masking on planes — it’s so crowded and people close by are sniffing and coughing. I’m not comfortable without a mask on flights. Tuznik: In general, I stopped masking [over the summer], except in the hospital, but have been more cognizant of it this past month. I have been masking up in health care settings regularly since COVID cases have gone up, both for my own protection and the patients’. With our current COVID trends and flu and RSV entering the picture, I foresee myself continuing this practice in the health care setting, and, depending upon viral trends, when I am out in busier indoor settings such as grocery stores. I usually use a regular surgical mask for crowded outdoor events, but upgrade to N95 or KN95 if I’m close to people indoors or on a plane.”—Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseasesDo you have advice for parents and grandparents to keep themselves and their kids healthy? Tuznik: If a grandparent is spending a lot of time with a grandchild who attends school, daycare, or is around other children, I would strongly advise for vaccines and boosters. Grandparents may even consider COVID tests for the child just to offer some reassurance, especially if the grandparent has higher medical risks. Blumberg: No special advice for children other than to be up to date with vaccines. Those 12 and over who catch COVID should consider getting Paxlovid. For those at increased risk for severe disease, such as older grandparents or great grandparents, consider asking youngsters to COVID test before they visit. What are you telling your own friends and family about preventing COVID and other viral illnesses? Blumberg: I give the usual advice, which I hope they don’t take it as nagging: get your vaccines, mask in crowded situations, take a COVID test if you might be sick, and get antiviral treatment if you test positive. I recommend Paxlovid for COVID and Tamiflu for influenza; both will shorten how long you’re sick, and Paxlovid reduces your risk of severe disease and long COVID. Tuznik: Everything you read above. Please consider getting vaccinated if you’re not already. Also, wash or sanitize your hands multiple times a day. I can’t emphasize vaccines and hand hygiene enough.

ADRIAN LAM, TIMES COLONIST Listen to this article 00:05:00 A marine mammal rescue centre says it’s monitoring incoming seals for the lethal and contagious avian flu virus, after harbour seals on a small island in Puget Sound were found to be infected. Tests completed late last week found the H5N1 strain of avian influenza in three adult harbour seals in the sound. Martin Haulena, the lead ­veterinarian and director of animal health and research at the Vancouver Aquarium Marine Mammal Rescue Centre, said while no seals with the virus have so far been detected in Canada, it might be just a matter of time. “Certainly the seals in Washington mix with ours, and they do travel far, so there’s a good chance,” said Haulena. “We are monitoring every seal that comes in.” The Department of Fisheries and Oceans said it did not have a representative to speak on the issue on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s national veterinary service said the seals that tested positive were stranded on Marrowstone Island in Flagler State Park on Aug. 18 and 25. None of the seal pups tested positive, it noted. The first avian flu cases in marine mammals on the west coast, they followed an ongoing outbreak affecting seabirds on Rat Island and Marrowstone Island since mid-summer, said the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service. The outbreak has resulted in the deaths of about 1,700 birds, it said. The islands are next to each other in the northern portion of Puget Sound. Haulena said avian influenza is fatal for birds, and could also kill seals, sea lions and other ­pinnipeds. He said transmission of the avian flu to other species is also possible, including Bigg’s killer whales that feed on harbour seals and are plentiful in the Salish Sea. Seals often haul out on rocky islets and islands where birds are plentiful, and Haulena said the Puget Sound seals could have caught the virus by ingesting bird feces and other secretions. Seals also occasionally eat birds, he said. Haulena said sea birds have also died from the influenza strain along B.C.’s coast over the past several years. Kristin Wilkinson of the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service said the discovery of H5N1 in seals highlights the potential for cross-species transmission and the complexity of managing infectious diseases in wildlife populations. “As the investigation continues, the collaboration among agencies remains essential to understanding and addressing this situation,” she said. Seals have been diagnosed with influenza before. In the late 1970s, the virus was detected in harbour seals in the northeast U.S., and again in the early 1980s. In the 1990s, several seals died of pneumonia in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Outside of the U.S., the disease has been found in dead seals in Russia, the United Kingdom and several countries in South America, including hundreds of seals in Peru. Haulena said seals afflicted with avian flu can suffer from respiratory or neurological issues and often look lethargic. At times, however, infected seals show no signs of being sick. The aquarium says it does extensive testing on the animals when they are brought to the facility. This year, 64 seal pups were brought to the aquarium and 57 are still on site. Haulena cautioned anyone who sees a seal in distress not to handle it themselves and to call DFO or the aquarium’s mammal rescue centre. The World Health Organization in July reported that deadly avian influenza outbreaks are increasing among mammals, including cats and dogs, mink and seals. In its report, WHO said avian influenza viruses normally spread among birds, but the increasing number of H5N1 avian influenza cases in mammals, which are biologically closer to humans, raises concerns that the virus might adapt to infect humans more easily. “In addition, some mammals may act as mixing vessels for influenza viruses, leading to the emergence of new viruses that could be more harmful to animals and humans.” Avian flu in humans has also been reported, but cases remain rare, said the WHO report. It said eight human cases have been reported since December 2021. “Infections in humans can cause severe disease with a high mortality rate, though human cases detected so far are mostly linked to close contact with infected birds and contaminated environments,” WHO said.

(Photo courtesy of Executive Office of the Maryland Governor) This article was first published by KFF Health News. As summer edges toward fall, thoughts turn to, well, vaccines. Yes, inevitably, it’s time to think about the usual suspects — influenza and COVID-19 shots — but also the new kid in town: recently approved vaccines for RSV, short for respiratory syncytial virus. But who should get the various vaccines, and when? “For the eligible populations, all three shots are highly recommended,” said Georges Benjamin, a physician and the executive director of the American Public Health Association. Still, there’s no need to get them all at the same time, and there are reasons to wait a bit for two of them. Some people may also face cost issues. Let’s break this down. What’s the price? It depends on the vaccine — and on your insurance coverage. For COVID shots, including the updated ones expected to be available this fall, most people will still be able to get the vaccines for free. People became accustomed to that no-cost availability during the pandemic, but the federal government stopped picking up the entire tab with the end of the public health emergency this spring. Now the actual cost of the vaccine, which manufacturers said could be far higher than what the government paid during the pandemic, will be borne by private insurers and Medicare and Medicaid. For people without insurance, the Biden administration set up the Bridge Access Program, which will make free vaccines available this fall through community health centers and state health departments. Eventually, retail pharmacies may also participate. Pfizer and Moderna, two of the companies producing updated COVID vaccines, previously suggested they would charge $110 to $130 per dose, and plan to offer programs for people who cannot afford the vaccines. In July, the Biden administration urged both makers to set a “reasonable” rate for the updated versions. Another company, Novavax, has said it will also have an updated vaccine for the U.S. market. It is still unclear how prices will shake out. In a recent Moderna earnings call, company officials indicated they are negotiating contracts with payers but did not give per-dose figures. The company expects COVID vaccine sales worldwide to tally $6 billion to $8 billion this year. The Affordable Care Act says patients don’t have to pay for certain preventive care, including some vaccines. That means flu shots are offered at no cost to people with insurance, including those on Medicare and Medicaid. Those without insurance may be able to land a free or low-cost shot from some health centers and state health departments. The cost of the flu vaccine depends on the type of shot and the pharmacy or medical outlet providing it but can range from $20 to more than $70. Similar rules apply to the new RSV vaccines, which may carry a price tag between $180 and $295 a shot. Because they are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, they are covered for people with private insurance without a copay. The Inflation Reduction Act did the same for Medicare beneficiaries and provided incentives for states to follow suit with Medicaid. Still, Medicare beneficiaries should note that the RSV vaccine is covered under Part D of the program, so those who have not signed up for the drug benefit may have to pay out-of-pocket. It may take a while for insurers to list the RSV vaccine on their formularies, so patients are advised to check their health plans before making an appointment. The uninsured, however, will need to turn to low-cost clinics or health departments, although those programs may vary. Such lack of access “means we will have another health disparity for people who can’t afford it,” said Benjamin, of the public health association. Luckily, most of those seeking the shot are likely to be on Medicare, which will cover it, he said. “But if you are 60 to 65 and not yet on Medicare, you might have some challenges.” RSV vaccines The newest of the vaccines target RSV, a common respiratory illness. The season for RSV infections usually begins in the fall and lasts into the spring, potentially peaking in January and February. The CDC estimates that 60,000 to 160,000 people 65 and older are hospitalized because of RSV annually, with approximately 6,000 to 10,000 deaths among that age group. Infants and older adults are most at risk. Risk factors for having a more severe case include increased age, but also underlying conditions like lung diseases, cardiovascular problems like congestive heart failure, diabetes, and kidney and liver disorders, and being immunocompromised. The illness can also aggravate existing conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The two new vaccines have been approved for older adults, with the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel saying people 60 or older should be able to get one of them if they and their doctor or other medical provider agree it would be a good precaution. If you fall into those categories, don’t wait too long, said William Schaffner, a physician and professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. “That’s one you can do and get out of the way right now.” Those who get one of the new RSV vaccines now should take a brief pause of at least two weeks before getting any other vaccination because there isn’t much data on whether they interact with other shots when received concurrently, he said. The effectiveness of the RSV vaccines in preventing severe disease is expected to remain high through this year’s RSV season, and they may also provide some protection the following year, based on information from the clinical trials. In early August a new monoclonal antibody, which contains lab-made antibodies against RSV, was approved for infants under 8 months and certain other young children, and it should be available soon. The shot is similar to a vaccine, but it works faster because it supplies the antibodies itself rather than spurring a baby’s immune system to produce them. Among children under 5, RSV causes 58,000 to 80,000 hospitalizations and 100 to 300 deaths each year, according to the CDC. On Monday, the FDA approved Pfizer’s RSV vaccine to be given during pregnancy to convey protection to infants after they are born until they are 6 months old. It isn’t yet known when the vaccine will become available or the specific recommendations the CDC will make about who should get it. As with any drug or vaccine, side effects are possible with any of the new shots, including pain at the injection site, headache, fatigue, and some other, rarer side effects. “It’s always good to sit down and talk with your doctor. They know your medical history,” said Mahdee Sobhanie, an infectious diseases physician at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. COVID and influenza vaccines Both COVID and flu shots are worth getting, but it might be a good idea to wait a little bit. One reason is that updated COVID shots awaiting approval are formulated to work against strains more commonly circulating now, known as the XBB lineage. The boosters will not directly target the new “Eris” variant currently rising in the U.S., though Eris is considered a descendant of XBB. If approved, the updated vaccines are expected to become available around late September. When to get vaccinated can be confusing, with the seasonality of the illnesses varying a bit. Flu season usually starts in late fall and runs into spring. We have fewer years’ data on COVID, but it appears to vary with the seasons, too, with upticks in winter when people gather inside, but also during hot summer months, when people are more likely to seek air-conditioned indoor venues. With the updated COVID vaccines expected in the next couple of months, patients should be able to get a COVID vaccination and an influenza shot at the same time, said Schaffner. “We have good info they don’t interact,” he said. The influenza vaccine is designed to last through the season, but effectiveness can wane. For that reason, even though you might start seeing ads in August, many experts suggest waiting until the end of September or early October to get a flu shot. “If you get it too early, it might not cover you too well toward the end of the season,” Schaffner said.

The CDC recommends everyone age 6 months and older get both shots.Also new this year: Infants and older adults can be protected against RSV, one of the most common viruses and one that causes a significant number of hospitalizations among vulnerable adults and very young children. It can be deadly.Here’s what you need to know about this year’s respiratory viruses and vaccine options.COVID-19 is still hereCases of COVID-19 started to creep up earlier this fall for the first time in several months, and the virus is likely to spread as more activities move indoors.“COVID-19 never left us,” said John Segreti, MD, hospital epidemiologist. “We’ve continued to see cases in Chicago and at RUSH, but fortunately there has been no spike in cases or hospitalizations since the omicron variant arrived.”Now, new vaccines tailored to better combat more recent variants have been approved by the FDA and the CDC. The boosters from Pfizer and Moderna replace the previous versions of the COVID-19 vaccine, and they are being administered at pharmacies, local health departments, health clinics, some doctor’s offices and other vaccine distribution sites nationwide. The shot is expected to be covered by insurance, Medicare and Medicaid, and federal and local agencies are working on ways to provide the vaccine to the uninsured.SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has mutated several times over since it first appeared in late 2019. A new strain called the Delta variant appeared in mid-2021, but it was overtaken quickly by the fast-spreading omicron variant.Omicron itself continues to change, which is why the new boosters by Moderna and Pfizer are designed to target a relatively new omicron subvariant called XBB.1.5. Even newer subvariants have emerged in some parts of the world while the vaccine was being developed, with one, BA.2.86, having a high number of mutations. BA.2.86 is in a few nations, including the U.S. where it currently has been found in human and wastewater samples in nine states, and not, so far, in Illinois. Yet, even for these new variants, the booster is expected to be protective against severe disease, hospitalization and death.“I’m telling my patients to get the new vaccine. If they sat out the last booster, their levels of protection are quite low,” said infectious disease physician Beverly Sha, MD, whose research includes COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials at RUSH. “With a newer vaccine that addresses newer variants, there’s even more reason to get it now.”Some patients are still concerned about safety, Sha added. “But it is really like the flu vaccine model: Everything is the same but the variant, so all of the safety data, from billions of doses, tells us these vaccines are very safe.”The annual flu vaccine addresses egg allergiesInfluenza is a highly contagious respiratory virus that kills tens of thousands of Americans each year and hundreds of thousands worldwide — even with annually updated flu vaccines. Like SARS-CoV-2, the influenza viruses continually mutate, and so, each year, ahead of the fall/winter flu season, a vaccine targeted to the newest strains is developed and distributed.The flu vaccine is most commonly given as a shot in the arm, but it also can be administered with a nasal spray to healthy people who are ages 2 to 49, excluding pregnant women, who should get the shot. The vaccine is available at pharmacies, doctors’ offices, health clinics and some workplaces.This season, people with egg allergies can get the flu vaccine without taking extra precautions, whether the vaccine contains egg product or not, the CDC said. Before this year, those with egg allergies were advised to use a version of the vaccine that didn’t contain any egg product or get vaccinated in a medical setting.Game-changing protection against RSVOne of the most common respiratory viruses went unnoticed by most people for years, until last winter, when a surge in cases contributed to children’s hospital beds being filled across the country. Yet RSV, short for respiratory syncytial virus, affects people of all ages, and it is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia.RSV is so common that nearly all children will have it before they are 2 years old, and they will have it repeatedly throughout their lifetime. The first case is usually the most severe. In the great majority of cases, especially among adults, RSV does not cause major illness, and the symptoms may mimic a cold. But RSV can be more severe in infants, older adults and people who have asthma, heart and lung disease, compromised immunity and other health conditions or are living in a long-term care facility.After years of work to develop protections against the virus for young and old alike, new options are available. For infants, whose tiny airways are easily distressed, a preventive medication called nirsevimab is recommended by the CDC to protect all babies under 8 months old and some children under age 2 who are at higher risk from RSV. While not a vaccine, nirsevimab works similarly by producing protective antibodies before an infection occurs, said pediatric infectious disease specialist Colleen Nash, MD, MPH.“This is an exciting new option that is expected to lessen RSV-related hospitalizations and office visits for infants,” Nash added.Earlier this year, the first vaccine for RSV was approved. The CDC recommends it for some adults over age 60, and for pregnant women, so that their infant will be born with protection from the virus. While the monoclonal antibody medication and the vaccine for pregnant women are broadly recommended, the CDC said some people age 60 and older should get the RSV vaccine, based on their risk factors and a discussion with their physician.The combination of vaccines and the preventive medications is expected to greatly reduce the threat of RSV infections, said Mariam Aziz, MD, who is leading a long-term clinical trial at RUSH for another type of RSV vaccine. The protections have been decades in the making, she added.“These will be game changers,” she said.Learn what other facts RUSH experts have shared about the current vaccines and viruses and how they are watching out for future threats:Little evidence that newest variant will evade immunityNew COVID boosters could roll out in the coming daysUS approves updated COVID vaccines to rev up protection this fallCOVID hospitalizations increase for 6th consecutive week but still at historic low Stop the Spread Even with all of the changes this virus season, the prevention and treatment basics are the same: Get the COVID-19 and flu vaccines, and RSV protection when appropriate. Handwashing remains essential. Consider wearing a mask if you are vulnerable to illness or with someone who is, if you are sick or when you are in a poorly ventilated area. To stop RSV, take extra care in disinfecting surfaces, because it is easily spread by touching contaminated surfaces. If you feel ill, get tested for COVID-19, but stay home until you are better, whether the test is positive or not. If you do have COVID-19, talk to your doctor about the antiviral medication Paxlovid to reduce the severity of the illness. Check with your doctor if you may have RSV; ask your pediatrician about RSV symptoms and what to do if you have a baby or a toddler at risk of a serious infection. A telehealth visit through RUSH on Demand may be a good option if you or a loved one has symptoms of a respiratory virus infection.

(Ed Hunter/CBC)Social SharingNew Brunswick has revamped the way it reports on COVID-19 again, including the launch of a new Respiratory Watch report that combines updates on both COVID-19 and influenza, and new definitions of COVID deaths and hospitalizations."With the arrival of the new respiratory illness season, it makes sense to monitor both of these diseases together so that New Brunswickers can be informed of the impacts these diseases are having on the health of the population," Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said in a statement.The respiratory report, which is located on the province's COVID-19 site, also includes only seasonal vaccination data and has a section dedicated to nursing home outbreaks.The new format reflects similar reporting approaches in other provinces, including British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan, Russell said.A COVID death is now defined as "a confirmed case who was admitted to hospital and whose death occurred during their stay.""A death due to COVID-19 or influenza does not mean that it was necessarily the primary or contributing factor to the cause of death," Health Department spokesperson Sean Hatchard said in an emailed statement. "Therefore, only deaths that occur in hospital will be reported."Only COVID-19 deaths that occur in hospital will be reported now, the province announced Tuesday. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)Since March 2022, Public Health has been reporting COVID deaths as those where the virus was either the primary cause of death or a directly contributing factor.Previously, the province used the national surveillance case definition for a deceased COVID-19 case: a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case whose death resulted from a clinically compatible illness, unless a clear alternative cause of death is identified, such as trauma, poisoning, or drug overdose.Deaths that occur outside hospital are subject to a reporting lag that can last months, said Hatchard, while in-hospital deaths are "a more timely indicator for disease severity."The pandemic death toll of 935 has also been dropped and replaced with a respiratory season total of zero.Back to counting hospitalized 'for' and 'with' COVIDCOVID hospitalizations, meanwhile, now include patients who have been hospitalized both for and with COVID-19, rather than only those who have been hospitalized because of complications from the disease."The department recognizes that both types of patients have an impact on the system," said Hatchard.Since April 2022, the province has been counting only people who were hospitalized because of the virus. People who were initially admitted to hospital for another reason and later tested positive for COVID were no longer included.No deaths, 44 COVID hospitalizations, cases upAccording to the new report, no COVID deaths occurred between Aug. 27 and Sept. 2.That's down from seven COVID deaths in the previous COVIDWatch report, which covered July 23 to Aug. 26. While COVIDWatch provided only three age categories for deaths, with the youngest being under 50, Respiratory Watch includes five age categories — under four, five to 19, 20 to 44, 45 to 64, and 65 and older.Forty-four people were hospitalized for or with COVID-19 during the latest reporting week, including one person who required intensive care, up from the 24 admitted to hospital because of the virus in the previous report.One person was aged 20 to 44, three were 45 to 64 and the other 40 were 65 or older, including the one in ICU.250% jump in hospitalizations at HorizonHorizon Health Network, meanwhile, has seen a 250 per cent jump in the number of people it has hospitalized for or with COVID-19 in the past two weeks, its updated COVID-19 dashboard shows.It has 42 active COVID-19 hospitalizations, as of Sept. 9, up from 12 on Aug. 26. Two people are in intensive care, up from one.Vitalité has not updated its COVID website. Although the province and Horizon have both switched to bimonthly reports, as of Tuesday, it plans to continue with monthly updates "for the time being," an unidentified spokesperson told CBC.Horizon also reported COVID outbreaks on six hospital units, up from none, and 21 health-care workers off the job because they tested positive for the virus, up from 11.Health Canada approves Moderna's updated COVID-19 vaccineA total of 95 new lab-confirmed cases of COVID have been reported across New Brunswick, an increase from the previous report week.The positivity rate also increased, to 14 per cent, and eight lab-confirmed outbreaks were declared.COVID activity is described as "moderate."No influenza activity has been recorded yet this respiratory season, which began Aug. 27.Vaccination rate changesAs for vaccination data, the department will focus on how many people have received a vaccine for COVID-19 or influenza within the current respiratory illness season.This is "in order to portray the level of protection in the community," Hatchard said.The statistics aren't available on the Respiratory Watch page yet, but 31,113 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered between March 12 and Sept. 11, according to Hatchard. He did not provide the total eligible population.Health Canada has approved Moderna's updated COVID-19 vaccine for all Canadians who are six months of age or older, but no information about when the shots will be available in New Brunswick has been released. (Kristopher Radder/The Associated Press)On Tuesday, Health Canada approved Moderna's updated COVID-19 vaccine, which targets the Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant, for all Canadians six months or older.Health Canada said Canadians age five and up should receive one dose. Children from six months to four years old should receive two doses if they have never had a COVID vaccine, or one dose if they've had at least one dose.Public Health will be offering eligible New Brunswickers vaccines for COVID-19 and influenza this fall, said Russell. She could not provide details.N.B. government disputes findings of audit, says 'COVID core' had no decision-making power"In the meantime, Public Health recommends that patients speak with their health-care provider to determine the level of risk they may face if they choose to wait for the new vaccination formulation to arrive," Russell said.As it stands, the only New Brunswickers eligible since July 1 have been those aged 65 and older or those 18 and older who are moderately to severely immunocompromised, who did not receive a spring booster and whose last shot or infection was at least five months ago, and new residents of long-term care facilities aged 18 and older who did not receive a spring booster and whose last shot and/or infection was at least five months ago.Health Canada is still reviewing updated vaccines from other companies, including Pfizer-BioNTech's Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccine for Canadians aged six months and older and Novavax's shot for people aged 12 and older.Nursing home outbreaksLab-confirmed COVID outbreaks were reported at two unidentified nursing homes in the province Aug. 27 to Sept. 2, while six outbreaks were reported in "other" vulnerable settings, the report shows. No other details are provided.An outbreak is defined as two or more positive cases among residents or staff with an epidemiological link within 10 days.Info on positive rapid tests and sequencing droppedSubmitted positive rapid test results will not be posted on the Respiratory Watch page."Now that the COVID-19 state of emergency has ended the department feels regular reporting of this information is no longer required," said Hatchard.In addition, the province is no longer including sequencing breakdowns for COVID-19.Public Health will only confirm the presence or non-presence of a subvariant upon request, said Hatchard."It should be noted, however, that if the situation was to change, and a new subvariant was to emerge and pose more severe health risks to New Brunswickers, Public Health would inform the population as needed," he said.On Monday, Hatchard confirmed the highly mutated new Omicron variant BA.2.86 has not been detected in the province. "Nearly all circulating strains are of the XBB family," he said.The first Canadian case of BA.2.86, which has health experts watching closely because of its high number of mutations, was recently confirmed in British Columbia. So far, it does not appear to be more severe.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories N.B. failed to ensure nursing homes were prepared for a pandemic, audit finds N.B.'s top doctor at bottom of COVID-19 decision-making hierarchy, auditor general finds COVID cases, hospitalizations increase, deaths decrease in N.B.

article Share toX Certain groups are at an increased risk for serious complications from the flu, including adults 50 years of age and older and those with chronic health conditions. Sanofi's two higher-dose influenza vaccines, Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) and Flublok® Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine), have shown better flu protection than standard-dose flu shots in older adults.a,b BRIDGEWATER, N.J., Sept. 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- In collaboration with Ice-T, Sanofi has debuted a trailer for this year's newest thriller – The Season. The trailer taps into suspenseful movie tropes to educate older adults, particularly those with chronic health conditions, about the risks associated with the flu. The Season serves as a powerful reminder about the importance of higher-dose flu vaccines to help protect more vulnerable populations from the flu and its related complications. "The Season" "The Season" "The Season" "The Season" The Season is part of a national flu vaccination campaign from Sanofi and the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists (ASCP), an organization that represents healthcare professionals who are focused on the medication needs of older adults. The campaign encourages older adults, particularly those with one or more underlying health conditions, to speak with their healthcare provider about flu vaccine options that may be right for them, which may include Fluzone® High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) or Flublok® Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine). Michael Greenberg, MD, MPHNorth America Medical Head of Vaccines at Sanofi"The flu can be a serious public health threat and lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, and pneumonia. These can be especially dangerous for older adults, ethnic and racial minority groups who are at an increased risk for being hospitalized from the flu, and those living with chronic conditions, like asthma, diabetes and heart disease. Our hope is that, as a part of our annual commitment to educating the public about the flu, this campaign will increase awareness of the importance of flu vaccination and remind older adults and at-risk populations that there are vaccines available to them that may provide better protection for their specific needs, such as Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent or Flublok Quadrivalent." The United States may face a resurgence of flu this year. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), preliminary results for the 2022-2023 season indicate approximately 70 per 100,000 people aged 18 and older were hospitalized for flu in the United States. The rate was more than double in adults aged 65 and older.Chad Worz, PharmD, BCGP, FASPExecutive Director and Chief Executive Officer of ASCP "Flu is unpredictable. Most of us already know that getting an annual flu shot is important, but it is also critical for people to understand which flu shots are most appropriate for them, especially older adults. As a pharmacist, I see many people coming in to get vaccinated who don't know which flu shot options are available to them, and I want more people to feel empowered to talk to their doctors or pharmacists about their options." It's important for those who bear the greatest burden of the flu – people age 65 years and older – to get vaccinated. Since 2010, the CDC estimates that between 50% and 70% of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations occurred in this age group. Ice-TRapper/Actor"As a rapper, actor, husband and father, I don't get a lot of sick days, so it's critical for me to get my flu shot every year. Now that I'm 65, I've learned that the flu can potentially cause more complications for me, and that higher-dose flu shots may give me better protection. This is why I am so excited to be partnering with Sanofi so that I can help deliver this important public health message."Visit SanofiFluShots.com to learn more about the potential complications associated with the flu, including heart attack, stroke and pneumonia, and to learn more about Sanofi's Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine) and Flublok Quadrivalent (Influenza Vaccine).

Hall, USA TODAYThree viral infections are expected to be common across Ohio this year, and healthcare professionals are already urging patients to consider becoming inoculated against them over the next few weeks.Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (flu) and COVID-19 have already all made their presence known in the Buckeye State, according to Jill Hartson, the director of preparedness and prevention for the Ashland County Health Department.It's only the start of an illness season that could linger until May.That's why medical offices are beginning to stock up on RSV and flu shots and are eagerly awaiting the release of this year's updated COVID shots."It should be noted the safety risks of getting all three simultaneously hasn't been studied," Hartson said. "Individuals should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor."'We encourage October and November clinics'The most effective window to receive a flu vaccination is October and November, according to Kate Siefert, health commissioner for Crawford County.That allows patients to become inoculated "prior to holiday gatherings and not too early that the effectiveness wears off.""Most flu boosters indicate their best effectiveness lasts about six months," Siefert said. "Flu season can go into April and May in Ohio, so we encourage October and November clinics so people are still covered while the flu is still spreading."Even after they get a shot, everyone is urged to follow common hygiene practices, such as "frequent handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes, staying home when you are sick, avoiding others that are sick and keeping your commonly touched surfaces clean."'There are new RSV prevention options'Residents of the southeastern portions of the country have already entered their RSV season. The virus is expected to spread to the north and west over the next three months."There are new RSV prevention options, including vaccines to protect infants and young children at higher risk and older adults," Hartson said.A new antibody called "Nirsevimab" is awaiting FDA approval and is expected to be available by October."Parents should talk to their pediatrician about the product," Hartson said. "It is available for infants less than eight months, and infants and children ages 8 to 19 months who are at increased risk of severe RSV."Several COVID variants will circulate this fallNew variations of COVID have emerged throughout the world this year. Healthcare professionals will continue tracking EG.5, FL.1.5.1 and BA.2.86 this autumn.The FDA is expected to approve the latest COVID vaccines and boosters this month. It is not yet known if those doses will be free and, if not, what percentage of the cost will be covered by insurances."The COVID-19 vaccine formula from last fall is still available and can be administered, but individuals may want to consider waiting for two reasons," Hartson said. "One, while we are in a current wave of COVID-19 infections now, historically, we have seen a higher wave in the winter and getting a vaccine closer to the winter wave may better prevent infection. Secondly, the updated vaccine formula may be more helpful against currently circulating variants."'A crucial role in preventing outbreaks'Vaccines do more than protect the person who received the shot, according to a Richland Public Health blog post published July 27."Vaccinations play a crucial role in preventing outbreaks in the community," the post reads. "When a significant percentage of the community is vaccinated, it decreases the spread of disease, helping to protect those who are unable to get vaccinated, like infants or people with immune system issues."Vaccines have helped rid the world of dangerous diseases, such as smallpox."Vaccination programs continue to keep diseases like polio, measles and whooping cough under control," the post reads.COVID masks debated by U.S. lawmakersPeople who find themselves sick this year are asked to "wear a high-quality mask" if they must be around others.Patients who contract COVID-19 are recommended to stay home in isolation for at least five days.Any federal requirements, though, may not be possible if U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) gets his wish.The new Buckeye lawmaker introduced his "Freedom to Breathe Act" last week, but the bill stalled on the Senate floor. On Friday, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) introduced the bill in Congress. It's fate is still undecided.Vance wrote the bill to prohibit any federal official — including the president — from issuing mask mandates applying to domestic air travel, public transit systems, or primary, secondary and post-secondary schools, the senator explained in a news release.The legislation would also prohibit air carriers, transit authorities and educational institutions from refusing service to individuals who choose not to wear a mask."We cannot repeat the anxiety, the stress and the nonstop panic of the last couple of years," Vance said. "That's what this legislation is about. End the mandates, end the panic, and let's get back to some common sense."ztuggle@gannett.com419-564-3508 Facebook Twitter EmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © Copyright Gannett 2024Ontario proposes letting pharmacists prescribe flu meds, give RSV vaccines | CBC News ContentSkip to Main ContentAccessibility HelphamburgerMenuWhen search suggestions are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.SearchSearchSign InQuick LinksNewsSportsRadioMusicListen LiveTVWatchnewsTop StoriesLocalClimateWorldCanadaPoliticsIndigenousBusinessThe NationalHealthEntertainmentScienceCBC News InvestigatesGo PublicAbout CBC NewsBeing Black in CanadaMore Ontario proposes letting pharmacists prescribe flu meds, give RSV vaccines | CBC News LoadedTorontoOntario proposes letting pharmacists prescribe flu meds, give RSV vaccinesOntario is planning to allow pharmacists to prescribe flu medication, administer flu shots to babies and administer RSV vaccines, when available, ahead of an expected fall viral surge.Health ministry seeking pharmacist feedback on draft regulationsAllison Jones · The Canadian Press · Posted: Sep 14, 2023 7:44 AM EDT | Last Updated: September 14, 2023Signage explaining that pharmacists are able to provide prescriptions for minor health conditions is photographed at a Shoppers Drug Mart in Toronto on January 11, 2023. (Tijana Martin/The Canadian Press)Social SharingOntario is planning to allow pharmacists to prescribe flu medication, administer flu shots to babies and administer RSV vaccines, when available, ahead of an expected fall viral surge.The Ministry of Health is asking for feedback on new draft regulations from the Ontario College of Pharmacists, but with a short two-week comment period as the respiratory virus season looms."During the 2022-23 fall and winter season, Canadians experienced a surge of respiratory infections due to increased infections of influenza, RSV and COVID-19, which resulted in higher than usual hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and deaths compared to previous seasons," the college writes in a document posted on the province's regulatory registry.WATCH | What COVID and flu season might look like this year, according to Ontario's top doctor: Worried about flu season, COVID? What to know about vaccines and masking1 year agoDuration 2:48As fall and winter approach, cases of COVID, RSV and the flu are expected to rise. Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Kieran Moore, spoke to CBC's Lorenda Reddekopp about how to reduce your risk of getting sick."Based on insight from multiple health system and pharmacy partners, the 2023-24 fall and winter season may experience a similar surge of influenza, RSV and COVID-19 as community-based public health measures, such as masking, have relaxed."The new rules would see pharmacists able to prescribe Tamiflu — medication to treat influenza — to patients over one year old. Pharmacists have also been able to prescribe Paxlovid to treat COVID-19 since December, and the Ontario Pharmacists Association says there have been more than 174,000 such prescriptions.Skip the doctor, see a pharmacist: 13 conditions you can have treated at an Ontario pharmacy in 2023As well, the regulations would allow pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to administer RSV vaccines once available.Health Canada has approved an RSV vaccine for people aged 60 and older, but it may be of limited use during this season as the National Advisory Committee on Immunization isn't expected to issue guidance on it until next year.In addition to seniors, infants are at a higher risk of getting very sick with RSV — or respiratory syncytial virus — but there is no vaccine for children, although they can receive antibody injections.Pharmacists have been able to administer flu shots to people as young as two years old since 2020 — down from the previous cut-off of age five — and the new rules would remove age restrictions so that babies could receive flu shots at pharmacies.The province also proposes to allow pharmacy technicians, who are able to administer COVID-19 vaccines, to give a host of other shots such as vaccines for HPV, hepatitis A and B, and rabies.Justin Bates, CEO of the Ontario Pharmacists Association, said the new rules would help people get health care more quickly and easily."These types of regulations will provide more access, and leveraging the success of the program that pharmacies have been involved in for some time now with the flu shots since 2013, and COVID shots," he said."We've done almost three million annually for flu shots and I think we did almost 13 million COVID shots over the course of the program. Now we're adding RSV vaccine ... which I think will be important defence, as we look at what happened last fall."Ontario expands pharmacists' prescription powers to ease burden on doctors, walk-in clinicsIntensive care units and emergency departments at the major children's hospitals across the province saw historic volumes in 2022 from October to December.Major pediatric hospitals in Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton and London, Ont., cancelled surgeries in order to redeploy staff to overflowing intensive care units, emergency departments and general wards.Health Minister Sylvia Jones is set to release a fall preparedness plan with the chief medical officer of health this week.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Skip the doctor, see a pharmacist: 13 conditions you can have treated at an Ontario pharmacy in 2023 Ontario expands pharmacists' prescription powers to ease burden on doctors, walk-in clinicsFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Dr. Pedro Piedra, professor of molecular virology and microbiology and of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, provides tips on when to get vaccinated for each to maximize your immunity against all three viruses. COVID booster COVID levels already are rising in the Houston area, so many are wondering about the right time to get their COVID booster. Currently, bivalent boosters are available that target both the original strain and omicron variant strains of COVID. Monovalent boosters targeting a newer strain of the omicron variant are expected to be available soon. Piedra said the decision about when to get vaccinated should be based on personal risk factors and levels of COVID in your community. “If you have not had a previous bivalent booster, I recommend getting one now, especially if you are in an at-risk group. It’s better to have some protection than no protection,” Piedra said. “If you have already received your bivalent booster and you are relatively healthy, you may want to wait for the monovalent booster.” Annual flu vaccine It is safe to get flu, RSV and Covid vaccines at the same time, but you may consider getting them at different times based on estimated peak activity for each virus, Piedra said. “The seasonality of the influenza virus has changed the last couple of years due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Piedra said. “This year, we may come back to the regular season, which usually sees flu activity begin in November and peak somewhere between January and March.” Piedra recommends getting your flu shot in October to build immunity before the season begins. Now is the time to make a plan for where you will receive the vaccine. Talk to your physician about setting an appointment or find out when vaccines will be available at your local pharmacy. The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older, but there are different options available based on age. Children younger than 8 years of age who have not been vaccinated before will require two doses, four weeks apart. Full immunity is not achieved until two weeks after the second dose, so these children should start vaccination earlier. FluMist is a safe and effective alternative to the vaccine for children who are afraid of shots, Piedra said. For adults 65 years of age and older, there are specialized vaccines with a higher antigen content, or adjuvant, to help the immune system develop a better response. If you do get the flu, Piedra recommends immediate treatment with antivirals. Treatment is most effective if started within two days of symptom onset. Make a plan with your physician now about the best way to get your prescription filled quickly in case of illness. RSV vaccine for older people and pregnant women For the first time ever, RSV vaccines are available for adults over age 60. According to Piedra, RSV activity in the Houston area currently is low. Because RSV season begins earlier than flu season, Piedra recommends that older adults talk to their physician about getting vaccinated now. The FDA also has approved a vaccine for pregnant women to prevent RSV in infants during their first three months of life when they are greatest at risk for severe infection. Pregnant women should consult their doctor about vaccination. Nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, was also approved for all infants less than 8 months of age. A single dose can provide protection against severe RSV infection. Infants born now, during the RSV season, are recommended to receive a single dose during their first week of life, Piedra said. He added that infants 8-19 months of age who are at increased risk for severe RSV infection and entering into their second RSV season, should also receive a single intramuscular injection of nirsevimab.

Only patients falling under Category C should be tested for influenza. According to the guidelines, people suffering from flu-like symptoms should be classed under Categories A, B and C. Those having a mild fever and cough/sore throat with or without body ache, headache, diarrhoea and vomiting fall under Category A, and need not be tested for influenza. They should be isolated at home, and require symptomatic management, while treatment with Oseltamivir, the recommended drug, is not required. Those having symptoms outlined for Category A, along with a high-grade fever or severe sore throat or high-risk conditions such as children aged under five, people above 65 years of age, pregnant women, persons with co-morbidities and persons with immuno-deficiency or on long-term steroid therapy, fall under Category B. They need not be tested, but can be treated with Oseltamivir as per schedule, along with broad-spectrum antibiotics. They should be isolated at home. Those with symptoms of Categories A and B with one or more of the following fall under Category C: breathlessness, chest pain, drowsiness, fall in blood pressure, sputum in blood, bluish discolouration of nails in adults, and children with flu-like illness with somnolence, high and persistent fever, inability to feed well, convulsions, shortness of breath, breathing difficulty, and worsening of any underlying chronic condition. They should be tested for influenza. They should be treated with Oseltamivir as per the schedule, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. They need immediate hospitalisation and treatment. Outlining the guidelines for wearing masks, the directorate said that in a community setting, medical personnel in screening areas, health workers involved in community surveillance and the public should use triple layer masks. The DPH recommended vaccination for prioritised groups – healthcare workers, pregnant women (irrespective of duration of pregnancy), persons with chronic illnesses and those who are immunocompromised, and children who have chronic diseases such as asthma, neuro-developmental conditions and heart diseases, and who are immunocompromised. It said vaccines were desirable for the elderly and children aged six months to eight years. Yearly vaccination with the World Health Organisation-recommended quadrivalentrivalent vaccines for the 2023-2024 influenza season was advised, the directorate said.

All mink at infected farms were ordered to be culled earlier. The culling order is based on protecting human health. The avian influenza viruses isolated from infected fur animals have been sequenced, which allows examining the genome of the virus and changes to it. The results of the sequencing support the suspicion that the virus also has spread between the fur animals and not only from birds to the fur animals. In addition to droplet transmission, the virus can spread between animals through contact with the secreta (saliva in particular) or feed of the animals, or contaminated litter and animal care equipment. It is often impossible to reliably determine the route of transmission. The longer the virus can circulate in other mammals, the higher risk of the virus mutating into a strain that can infect humans. Worrying mutations that make it easier for the virus to transfer between mammals have been found in the genome of the strains isolated from the animals of six fur farms. These mutations have been found in mink, foxes and raccoon dogs. Studies on the virus strains at fur farms continue in collaboration with the European Union Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza. The symptoms of animals infected with the avian influenza vary from mild to severe, and the infection can also be asymptomatic. It is therefore important that fur farms with no symptomatic animals are also subjected to inspections. For fur farms with a detected infection, sufficiently proving that the infection is eradicated would require such a large number of samples that it is not possible in practice. Hidden infections of asymptomatic animals would also cause a risk to the occupational health of employees during pelting, and the risk of spillover to humans would continue after pelting season as well. The new termination decisions issued by the Finnish Food Authority apply to approximately 115,000 animals, of which 109,000 are foxes and 6,000 raccoon dogs. In addition, the Finnish Food Authority previously issued the culling order of some 135,000 animals, of which 50,000 were mink, 79,000 foxes and 6,000 raccoon dogs. So far, avian influenza infections have been found at 26 fur farms in Ostrobothnia. Of these, all animals in 11 farms and some of the animals in five farms have been ordered to be culled. In addition, 10 farms have not been subjected to a culling order. The current culling order applies to all the remaining animals at these farms. Previously, termination decisions concerning foxes and raccoon dogs were made on a case-by-case basis. The scale and the severity of the symptoms of the infected farm animals were considered when making the decisions.

Some people with Crohn's or Colitis will be able to get the vaccine for free. Others might choose to pay to get it privately. Some medicines you might take for Crohn's or Colitis may lower your immune system. If this is the case, you may also be able to get a free COVID-19 booster. Flu vaccine programme 2023 Flu is an infectious illness. It spreads through the coughs and sneezes of people who are carrying the virus. The flu vaccine makes it less likely that you will get flu. If you do get flu, you are less likely to become seriously ill if you’ve had the vaccine. Who can have the flu vaccine on the NHS? Since 2020, the NHS has offered an extended programme of flu vaccination. This year, the criteria for people who can get a free flu vaccine has changed. People who can have the flu vaccine free on the NHS during the 2023 to 2024 flu season include: People in at-risk groups and those who care for them Anyone aged 6 months or over with certain health conditions. (In Scotland, anyone with these conditions aged 18 or over.) This includes people with a lowered immune system because of medicine they’re taking. Close contacts of someone with a lowered immune system. Pregnant people. Anyone living in a residential care home. Frontline workers in health and social care. Older people Anyone in England or Wales aged 65 or over. Anyone in Scotland or Northern Ireland aged 50 or over. Children and school staff In England and Wales, all children aged 2 or 3 years on 31 August 2023. Also, all primary school children and some secondary school children. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, all children aged 2 and older. This includes those at primary or secondary school. Eligibility varies depending on where you live. You might want to check the full details for your nation: England Northern Ireland Scotland Wales Are all people with Crohn's or Colitis eligible? Having Crohn’s or Colitis does not automatically mean you can have the flu vaccine free on the NHS. But if you take certain medicines for your Crohn’s or Colitis, you might be eligible. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and British Society for Gastroenterology (BSG) recommend having the flu vaccine if you take medicines that lower or alter your immune system. These include: Azathioprine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, tofacitinib, filgotinib and higher doses of steroids (such as the equivalent of 20mg or more of prednisolone). Biologic medicines, such as infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab and ustekinumab. This is not a complete list of medicines which, if you are taking them, means you can get the vaccine on the NHS. The decision is not always clear-cut. Your doctor should decide whether the treatment you are on puts you at risk of serious problems if you get flu. Many people taking oral or intravenous steroids can get the flu vaccine on the NHS. But you might not be eligible to have it for free if you are on a low dose. If you think you might be able to get the vaccine on the NHS, talk to your doctor. You might find it helpful to print this page or to show them the BSG recommendations. The chapter on flu in UKHSA’s ‘Green Book’ might also be useful. This includes specific guidance on which medicines mean you can have the flu vaccine on the NHS. Children Most children over 2, including all primary school children, can get the flu vaccine on the NHS. The school vaccination programme uses the nasal spray flu vaccine. This is not recommended for children who have a lowered immune system because it is a live vaccine. This means it is made from a weakened version of living viruses. In people who have a lowered immune system, live vaccines may cause infections. The injectable flu vaccine is not live and is safe for people who have a lowered immune system. It is best to ask your child's IBD team which vaccine is suitable for your child. If your immune system is low and a child you live with has the nasal spray flu vaccine, there may be a very low risk of catching flu from them. Although possible, no case of this has ever been recorded. But if your immune system is severely lowered, you may wish to see if they can have the injected vaccine instead. You can do this by contacting the child’s GP or school. What if I’m not eligible to have the flu vaccine on the NHS? If you are not eligible to have the flu vaccine on the NHS, you could choose to have it privately. You can get a private flu vaccine from many high-street or supermarket pharmacies. It usually costs around £10 or £20. It may be helpful to talk to your IBD team before you have the vaccine. When should I have the flu vaccine? High doses of steroids may have an impact on how effective the flu vaccine is. This is especially true if you are taking immunosuppressants at the same time. The BSG recommends that you should have the vaccine when you are taking the lowest steroid dose, if possible. Taking anti-TNF medicines doesn't seem to have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine. How do I get the flu vaccine? The system for having the flu vaccine is different in the four nations of the UK. England When and where you can get your vaccine depends on your age, job and clinical risk group. The NHS has more information about having the flu vaccine for adults or children. Northern Ireland When and where you can get your vaccine depends on your age, job and clinical risk group. You can find out more from NI Direct. Scotland If you live in Scotland and are eligible for a flu vaccine on the NHS, you should be contacted when it’s your turn. You can check online what vaccines you’re eligible for and how to book. Wales If you can have the vaccine on the NHS, you will be able to get it at your GP surgery or at some community pharmacies. If you work in health or social care, you may be able to get it through your employer. Children who are eligible for the flu vaccine on the NHS will be able to get it from their GP surgery or at school. You can find out more from Public Health Wales. COVID-19 booster vaccinations and flu You may have a lowered immune system because of medicine you’re taking for Crohn’s or Colitis. If this is the case, you might be eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine booster. You should be able to get both the flu vaccine and COVID-19 booster at the same appointment. If so, you will have one vaccine in each arm. It is safe and effective to have the COVID-19 and flu vaccines at the same time. The vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others against COVID-19. If you’re at higher risk, it is especially important to keep up-to-date with vaccinations.

From: UK Health Security Agency Published 14 September 2023 The next phase of the study will be known as SIREN 2.0 and began in September 2023. Established at the height of the pandemic in June 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 immunity and reinfection (SIREN) study has continually tested healthcare workers across the UK for COVID-19, providing crucial information relating to the virus. The evidence it has collected on immunity, vaccination and emerging variants played a critical role in informing the national response. The SIREN study introduced testing for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for healthcare workers, to help gather an understanding of the impact of these viruses on winter pressures in healthcare in winter 2022 and this will continue this year. The emergence of the BA.2.86 variant has resulted in the autumn vaccine campaign being brought forward. SIREN 2.0 testing of healthcare workers, a cohort eligible for the vaccine, will help provide answers on vaccine efficacy against this new variant, other circulating variants and infection-acquired immunity. SIREN 2.0 will recruit participants from our original cohort of 45,000 healthcare workers, which remains the largest study of its kind globally, and we have expanded our collaborations with the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the Worldwide Influenza Centre (WIC) at the Francis Crick Institute to ensure we continue to address important scientific questions. Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Adviser at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said: Thank you to all of our participants who make this crucial study possible. It is because of you that we have been able to collect vital data and insights on COVID-19 across the pandemic, furthering our understanding on immune response and the protection offered by vaccines. This new phase of the study – SIREN 2.0 – will allow us to play a core role in the continued surveillance of COVID-19, including the detection of emerging new variants, while we will also utilise multiplex testing to assess the impact of influenza and RSV on healthcare workers. I am delighted that we will be working with new partners from WIC and the Respiratory Virus and Microbiome Initiative (RVI) at the Wellcome Sanger Institute as we continue to answer the most important questions on the impact of respiratory diseases. The Wellcome Sanger Institute will sequence samples provided by UKHSA and use metagenomics to investigate other pathogens that cause respiratory infection such as parainfluenza. Meanwhile, we plan to share influenza virus strains identified during the study with WIC, and these may be used to design influenza vaccines for future seasons. Dr Ewan Harrison, Head of RVI at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: We are excited to be working with the SIREN study team to maximise the yield of science that can be done using the samples taken from the SIREN participants, which provide a unique opportunity to study respiratory virus infections in healthcare workers. The RVI builds on the technology used for the genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic. We hope that by expanding the range of respiratory viruses that are routinely sequenced, we can contribute to scientific understanding that will help prevent and treat infections caused by respiratory viruses. Blood samples from SIREN participants are already being tested in partnership with UKHSA’s newly established Vaccine Development and Evaluation Centre (VDEC) to understand the immune response provided by vaccination against new variants, including BA.2.86, providing vital evidence to inform the national risk assessment. The team will continue to assess the durability of protection of vaccination in our healthcare worker cohort, and will provide regular updates to experts, including the JCVI, and policymakers on the latest findings.

Despite the frustrations that come with getting sick, she said it is inevitable for UF students. “Everyone is bound to catch something at the start of the school year,” Ciccantelli said. A few weeks into the Fall semester, countless UF students are getting sick with various viruses, including the common cold and the latest COVID-19 strain, resulting in an outbreak of what has been dubbed as the 'Gainesville Plague'. On-campus resources Jocelyn Gravlee is the director of UF’s Student Health Care Center, which offers a Fast Track clinic on its second floor that sees patients with acute upper respiratory symptoms and same-day testing for illnesses like the flu. “Our mission is to help every UF student achieve optimal health in the pursuit of personal and academic success,” Gravlee said. Gravlee said viruses are common on college campuses, and flu season runs from mid-fall through spring. September and October remain the best times for most people to get their flu vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “However, it is not uncommon to see students with influenza this time of year,” she said. “There is nothing unique about Gainesville and [its] cold season.” The most recent Florida Department of Health report showed that Alachua County and other Florida counties’ flu rates were rising. Gravlee encourages students to stay home if they have a fever to limit the spread of infection. Symptoms and remedies Enjoy what you're reading? Get content from The Alligator delivered to your inbox Subscribe Now There are many similarities between symptoms of common colds, the flu and COVID-19, Jeb Justice, UF Chief of Rhinology and Skull Base Surgery and associate professor of Otolaryngology, said. These parallels include fatigue, cough, nasal congestion and facial pressure. However, COVID-19 typically comes with a dry cough, while a common cold and the flu do not, according to the Mayo Clinic. Justice said sinus infections often arise from having one of these viruses. “A true sinus infection…[comes] five to seven days after getting a common cold or having really bad environmental allergies,” Justice said. “If you have underlying allergies, that can predispose you to sinus infections.” More than 20 million Americans will have at least one episode of sinusitis this year, according to Harvard Health. Justice recommends students use Afrin nasal spray for sinus infections to aid with breathing and sleep during sickness, with a warning to not use it for more than three days to avoid addiction to the spray. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology also limits Afrin use to three days. Justice also advises students to try nasal irrigation to reduce congestion. “A lot of people will do nasal irrigations with either a neti pot or some sort of squeeze bottle,” Justice said. “You want to make sure you use distilled water… [it is] the safest way because the tap water can actually have microbes in it.” Some students turn to more holistic remedies to avoid getting sick. Genesis Soto-Alfonso, a UF microbiology sophomore, said they have started taking multivitamins and supplements to strengthen their respiratory system and prevent illness. “In my first year at UF, I would basically get sick every couple of weeks,” they said. “I have much less congestion as well as coughing less [now].” Mullein leaf and calcium magnesium zinc are among the supplements Soto-Alfonso includes in their daily routine. COVID-19 updates Although the CDC ended the federal declaration of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency in early May, the agency’s most recent statement said annual community outbreaks of COVID-19 infections will typically occur during late fall and winter. The newest variant is BA2.86, which has been given the unofficial nickname Pirola, Jerne Shapiro said. Jerne Shapiro, an instructional assistant professor in the department of epidemiology, was UF’s Lead Epidemiologist for its COVID-19 response and worked with the Alachua County Health Department to control the disease’s spread. The Florida Department of Health reported 23,960 overall cases of COVID-19 in the state of Florida. There were 70 new COVID-19 hospital admissions in Alachua County in the past week, according to the CDC. “This variant is not what is currently driving the increase in hospitalizations being seen across the U.S.,” Shapiro said. “Instead, it is being caused by other predominantly circulating viruses.” Early research shows that the COVID-19 vaccine and existing antibodies are effective against the BA2.86 variant. Still, Shapiro said it is important to wear a well-fitting mask such as a N-95 if you decide to wear one. “Cloth or surgical masks are ineffective, as the virus is too small and can go through the gaps,” Shapiro said. UF students have already started to test positive for COVID-19 this semester. Maite Chapartegui, a 19-year-old UF computer science sophomore, said she only became concerned about having COVID-19 after one of her roommates tested positive. “My symptoms before testing positive were congestion and sneezing, but I brushed it off as allergies,” Chapartegui said. “I typically get really bad allergies every day, and I am almost always congested.” Mild symptoms of COVID-19 may present similarly to allergies, according to the Mayo Clinic. UF students and employees with compromised immune systems should get vaccinated with the new booster vaccine that becomes available next week, Shapiro said. Students, faculty and staff can receive vaccines and boosters from the SHCC and UF Health pharmacies at no cost. Contact Jinelle at jvazquez@alligator.org. Follow them on Twitter @vazquezjinelle.

Winter viruses can be especially risky if you’re over 65, pregnant or have an underlying health condition. Don’t let your protection fade, if you're eligible. For further information see www.nidirect.gov.uk/wintervaccines #AutumnWinterVaccines #atriskgroups The autumn / winter vaccination programme, which includes the COVID-19 and flu vaccines has begun in Northern Ireland. The vaccines help to prolong protection already received from initial COVID-19 vaccinations, while the flu vaccine is needed every year as the antibodies that protect you from flu decline over time, and flu strains change from year to year. Some people may be offered the flu jab and COVID-19 vaccine at the same appointment. It is safe and effective to receive it in this way.

This will help protect not only them but also those around them, particularly older grandparents or relations with an underlying health condition. Children in particular can increase the spread of the flu virus in the community, but vaccination helps curb this. Pre-school children in Northern Ireland aged two years and over are eligible to receive the free flu vaccine through their GP.

Jabs will begin to be administered in the last week of September, instead of October, following a recent increase in the numbers, the department announced. The Covid-19 and influenza vaccinations, which will be carried out at the same time, are highly recommended for those aged over 60, as well as people residing in nursing homes, centres for the disabled or in prisons and those under 60 years of age with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, morbid obesity or cancer. The Ministry of Health also recommended that all pregnant women and women in the postpartum period and those living with people suffering from diseases get vaccinated, as well as all healthcare workers and essential workers, such as law enforcement, firefighters and civil defence services.

Immunisation will be carried out with doses adapted to fight the omicron variant after the European Commission a fortnight ago approved Pfizer's vaccine targeting the XBB 1.5 Omicron subvariant, which is currently causing the most infections. Coronavirus infections have not been counted since April last, but in primary care the rate of infection is currently at 130 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

Recent floods have doubled cases of dengue over the last three weeks and are the highest reported in the last six years, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) said in its latest statement. Cases of swine flu and typhoid are also being reported. Speaking to IANS, Ajay Aggarwal, Director of Internal Medicine at Fortis Hospital in Noida, said that there is an increase in the number of acute febrile illness cases. "Viral cases like influenza and dengue have been on the rise. Patients coming in with low platelet counts are seen with an increased frequency since the last month. However, not all cases of low platelet are dengue," Aggarwal said. "Patients generally present with high grade fever with chills along with generalised malaise, weakness, joint pains, cough, vomiting or loose stools -- all of which are included in the viral prodrome syndrome, the doctor said. In addition, there is also swine flu (H1N1). Aggarwal said "10-15 cases of H1N1 flu have been detected in our hospital". However, no cases of Covid have been reported yet, he noted. "There has been a 20-25 per cent rise in people coming with flu-like symptoms," Tushar Tayal, Lead Consultant, Department of Internal Medicine, CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram, told IANS. "Some elderly patients have also required hospital admissions, and consequently developed pneumonia and bronchitis," he added. Tayal said that dengue cases have reduced slightly, compared to the last two weeks. But certain patients are showing overlap in symptoms, who present flu-like symptoms which upon tests are turning positive for dengue, the doctor noted. In addition, there have been multiple cases of hepatitis and typhoid. This was also confirmed by online community platform LocalCircles in its recent survey which showed that one in two households in Delhi-NCR now has one or more individuals with viral symptoms. Households impacted have more than doubled in the last month. The survey, which included over 9,000 residents from Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida and Ghaziabad, revealed a sizable jump in people who are unwell with 50 per cent of households surveyed being affected now than last month. "Blood investigations like CBC are usually done on the third day of fever onset which may reveal low platelet count and neutropenia (low TLC)," Aggarwal said. Also, since dengue causes decreased immunity, it may be complicated by secondary bacterial infections as well, he said. "Treatment of viral febrile illness involves symptomatic management of fever along with adequate hydration. Patients are advised to seek doctor advice in case of very high grade fever, persistent vomiting, bleeding, severe loose motions or respiratory distress," the doctor noted.
