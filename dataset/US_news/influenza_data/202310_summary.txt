Pathogen infection causes a state of sickness characterized by behavioral and physiological changes.
The neural circuits and mechanisms that evoke sickness behavior during infections are still unclear.
Over-the-counter medications like aspirin and ibuprofen alleviate sickness by blocking the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).
A small population of glossopharyngeal sensory neurons (petrosal GABRA1 neurons) detects PGE2 and is essential for influenza-induced sickness behavior in mice.
Ablating these neurons or targeting the PGE2 receptor eliminates sickness behavior and improves survival in mice.
Petrosal GABRA1 neurons project to mucosal regions of the nasopharynx and display a specific axonal targeting pattern in the brainstem.
This reveals a primary airway-to-brain sensory pathway that detects locally produced prostaglandins and mediates sickness responses to respiratory virus infections.
