Preventing Seasonal Flu: 
- The best way to reduce the risk of flu and its complications is to get a flu vaccine every year.
- Vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months and older, especially those at higher risk.
- Flu vaccines help reduce the burden of flu illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.
- Vaccination can also reduce the severity of illness in vaccinated individuals who still get sick.
- Preventive actions such as avoiding close contact with sick individuals and practicing good hygiene can help reduce the spread of flu.
- People at higher risk, including young children, pregnant individuals, and those with chronic health conditions, should be vaccinated to decrease their risk of severe flu illness.
- Health care workers and people who live with or care for high-risk individuals should also be vaccinated to prevent the spread of flu.
- Additional precautions should be taken when sick, including staying home until symptoms improve and fever has subsided.
