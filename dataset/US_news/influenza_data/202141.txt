Spencer October 13, 2021 The worldwide spread of influenza came to a screeching halt in March 2020, when schools, businesses and daily life shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is expected to come back strongly this fall and winter, making flu vaccination more essential than ever. The best way to prevent seasonal flu is to get vaccinated every year. The CDC recommends everyone 6-months of age and older get a flu vaccine every season. “Every infectious disease specialist I know is expecting flu to return,” said infectious disease specialist Richard T. Ellison III, MD, professor of medicine and hospital epidemiologist at UMass Memorial Medical Center. “There is likely much less immunity to flu this year as no one was exposed to it, and many people may not have gotten the flu vaccine last year.” Dr. Ellison explained that global transmission of the virus was interrupted in 2020 when people stopped traveling and most locales were shutdown. “No one saw any significant cases of influenza. They went from thousands of cases a week down to 20 or so per week,” he said, pointing to World Health Organization data. Now that people are out and about, traveling more and wearing masks less, experts anticipate a resurgence of several infectious diseases, including the flu. Typically, influenza causes between 12,000 and 50,000 deaths per year in the United States, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many more become sick and require hospitalization. The widespread prevalence of COVID-19 infection already in the population – resulting so far in more than 700,000 deaths nationwide – makes the risk of influenza infection even more serious, Ellison said. “Because both viruses are spreading, it is quite possible somebody could get a double whammy and get both at the same time,” he said. “Having COVID is much more serious than having the flu but having both is probably worse than either by themselves.” The COVID-19 vaccine does not protect against the flu because the diseases involve different viruses. Similarly, there is no potentially harmful interaction between the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine. “It’s possible to get both vaccines at the same time,” said Ellison, “with the only downside of a bigger risk of a sore arm from getting two shots on the same day.” Ellison said the hospital laboratory is gearing up to test patients who come in with symptoms for both influenza and COVID-19. Jennifer Wang, MD, professor of medicine, agreed that there is potential for a worse flu season than usual “because we missed last season and there is less immunity in the community.” Plus, with students back in school, they may be bringing home the influenza virus, which could then infect older, more vulnerable relatives. “So now there are going to be two reasons to be wearing masks, doing the social distancing and not going out in large groups, which remains high risk for both flu and COVID,” Ellison said. “Anything you do to protect yourself against COVID is clearly helpful in protecting against the flu. Those things are all worth doing, on top of getting the vaccines.” Related stories on UMassMed News:A direct recommendation from a doctor may help with vaccine hesitancyCOVID-19 vaccine benefits pregnant women and babies, UMMS faculty say Sign up for weekly news emails Sign up Follow us!

Noticing the host factors that control biological responses, such as inflammatory cytokine secretion, to influenza virus infection is important for the development of novel drugs. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite and has essential biological functions in inflammation. However, the kinetic effects of influenza virus infection on physiological S1P levels and their signaling in multiple tissues remain unknown. In this study, we utilized a mouse model intranasally infected with 50 or 500 plaque forming units (PFU) of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8) virus to investigate how S1P levels and expression of its regulating factors are affected by influenza virus infection by the liquid-chromatography/mass spectrometry and real-time PCR, respectively. The S1P level was significantly high in the plasma of mice infected with 500 PFU of the virus than that in control mice at 6 day-post-infection (dpi). Elevated gene expression of sphingosine kinase-1 (Sphk1), an S1P synthase, was observed in the liver, lung, white adipose tissue, heart, and aorta of infected mice. This could be responsible for the increased plasma S1P levels as well as the decrease in the hepatic S1P lyase (Sgpl1) gene in the infected mice. These results indicate modulation of S1P-signaling by influenza virus infection. Since S1P regulates inflammation and leukocyte migration, it must be worth trying to target this signaling to control influenza-associated symptoms.

Although influenza is a disease of host immune response to the virus infection, particularly excess cytokine secretion, energy and fatty acid metabolism disorders have been suggested to be associated with the disease severity by previous studies representing higher mortality in patients or experimental animals with obesity, diabetes, and abnormal fatty acid oxidation1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Recently, sphingolipids, particularly sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), have emerged as molecules that modulate symptoms through their functions, e.g., the preservation of the integrity of the vascular endothelium and suppression of excessive cytokine responses, during influenza, dengue, and coronavirus disease 20199,10,11,12,13,14,15. Therefore, S1P agonism is considered to protect the host against influenza and other infectious diseases. This notion is supported by a previous study that S1P antagonists exacerbated cytokine storm and lethality during influenza in mice16.Sphingolipids, including sphingosine, ceramide, sphingomyelin, and S1P, are structural components in the plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells, characterized by hydrocarbon backbones having 2-amino-1,3-diol-termed sphingoid bases17. S1P is synthesized by sphingosine kinase (SPHK) isoenzymes SPHK1 and SPHK2, and decomposed into hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine by the action of S1P lyase 1 (SGPL1) or converted to sphingosine by S1P phosphohydrolases as a part of sphingolipid rheostat18,19. S1P synthesized inside the cell is extracellularly transported via multiple S1P transporters and wields pleiotropic effects through binding to G protein-coupled S1P receptors (S1PRs)20. S1P is present at high concentrations in the blood by the contribution of platelets21, red blood cells22, and endothelial cells23, but at low levels in tissues, and this concentration gradient is critical for S1P to exert its roles as a signaling molecule in preserving vascular endothelial cell barrier integrity and regulating the migration of immune cells through S1PRs24,25. As described earlier, S1P signaling is thought to be involved in the severity of infectious diseases, but S1P signaling is also modified in many viral infections through changes in the expression and activity of these enzymes and transporters, especially SPHK126. Since viral contact with host cell membranes occurs during viral entry and budding, it is not surprising that the sphingolipid metabolic system, a major component of cell membranes, is affected by a viral infection, as previously reviewed27. Given a possible protective role of S1P signaling in viral infectious diseases, it is important to understand how S1P metabolism is affected during viral infections. However, most of these findings have been obtained from experiments in cultured cells, and there are only a few reports of longitudinal observations of S1P concentrations during viral infection in vivo.Here, we investigated the kinetic profile of S1P levels in the plasma and liver with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) utilizing an influenza mouse model which had been established previously1. In addition, we analyzed gene expression levels of metabolic enzymes, receptors, and cellular transporters of S1P to explore possible regulating mechanisms of the lipid in response to influenza virus infection.Materials and methodsMaterialsThe LC/MS grade solvents methanol, acetonitrile, and isopropanol were obtained from Kanto Chemical Co. Ltd (Tokyo, Japan). The mobile phase additives acetic acid, ammonium acetate, and extraction solvent chloroform of LC/MS grade were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Ceramide/Sphingoid internal standard mixture II and sphingosine-1-phosphate were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). Sphingosine was obtained from Funakoshi Frontiers in Life Science (Tokyo, Japan). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was purchased from Gibco/Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA).VirusInfluenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8) was kindly provided by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan. The virus was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs at 35 °C for 48 h, and aliquots of collected allantoic fluids were stored at − 80 °C.MiceAs reported previously1, male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Hokudo (Sapporo, Japan) and were kept at a BSL-2 laboratory at the International Institute for Zoonosis Control, Hokkaido University, under standard laboratory conditions (room temperature 22 °C ± 2 °C, relative humidity 50% ± 10%) and a 12/12-h light/dark cycle1. The mice were administered a standard CE-2 chow diet purchased from CLEA Japan (Sapporo, Japan) with water ad libtum. Experiments were performed on 11–12 week-old mice. All the animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Hokkaido University (approval no. 17-0003).Virus infection and sample collectionPR8 virus at 50 or 500 plaque-forming units (PFU) in 50 µL of PBS or PBS only (control) were intranasally inoculated into the mice under inhalation anaesthesia with isoflurane (Fig. 1a). Body weight losses were monitored daily after infection, and mice were humanely euthanized when weight loss reached 25%. On 1, 3, or 6 days-post-infection (dpi), the mice were euthanized, and their liver and blood samples were collected. Blood samples were centrifuged at 1000g for 20 min at 4 °C in the presence of sodium heparin, and supernatants were collected as plasma. Each plasma sample was mixed with 4 volumes of methanol. Each liver sample was weighed and minced in 10 volumes of methanol. Plasma and liver samples with methanol were stored at − 80 °C until further lipid analyses.Figure 1Experimental design (a), sphingolipid extraction workflow (b), and changes in body weight and survival rate (c), after virus inoculation. Mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS control or PBS comprising PR8 virus (50 or 500 PFU), and body weight was daily monitored until 6 dpi. A total of 15 mice/group were used for the experiment and 5 mice each were euthanized for sample collection on 1, 3, and 6 dpi. The mean body weight of mice is represented as a percentage of the original weight (c).

On 1, 3, or 6 dpi, the mice were euthanized, and their liver, epididymal white adipose tissue (e-WAT), heart, lung, and thoracic aorta samples were collected and homogenized in 200–500 μL of TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at − 30 °C until RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples homogenized in TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and used for cDNA synthesis using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The gene expressions of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1, Mm00448841_g1), sphingosine phosphate lyase 1 (Sgpl1, Mm00486079_m1), sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1pr1, Mm02619656_s1), S1pr3 (Mm02620181_s1), ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A (ABC1), member 1 (Abca1, Mm00442646_m1), ATP-binding cassette, sub-family G member 2 (Junior blood group) (Abcg2, Mm00496364_m1), ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 1 (Abcc1, Mm00456156_m1), and spinster homolog 2 (Spns2, Mm01249324_m1) were quantified with commercially available TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). In addition, the following specific primers and a probe were used for the measurement of S1pr2 gene expression: forward primer, 5′-AGACGCCAAGGCCACTCA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTCCAGAACCTTCTCAGGATTGA-3′; probe (FAM), 5′-CTAGCCAGTGCTCAGC-3′. The concentrations of primers and probes in the reaction were 900 nM and 250 nM, respectively. The real-time PCR reaction was performed with a Step One Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The obtained gene expressions were normalized to those of 18S (Mm03928990_g1) from the same samples, and relative expressions were calculated using the comparative Ct method. The cut-off value of the Ct value used in the analysis was set to 35. The ddCt values of all the analyzed genes in this study were provided in Supplementary Table S1.Extraction of S1PS1P was extracted from the liver, lung, and plasma by the method established earlier with minor modifications28. In brief, liver or lung tissue weighed was transferred into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, and methanol (10 µL/mg) was added to normalize the weight and deactivate the virus. Five to six ceramic beads (1.4 mm, catalog no. 15-340-159, Fisher brand, Waltham, MA) were added to the tubes, and the tissue was homogenized (30 s × 2) using Bead Mill 4 (Fisher brand) homogenizer. About 100 µL (10 mg) of the liver homogenate or 50 µL of plasma was used for the extraction of S1P. Cer/Sph mixture II (Avanthi Polar Lipids), diluted to 5 µM with methanol, was used as an internal standard (IS mix). The detailed workflow of the extraction was described in Fig. 1b. The amount of sample injected into LC/MS was 10 µL.LC/MS analysisThe single reaction monitoring (SRM) analysis was performed using a Surveyor HPLC system coupled to a TSQ Quantum 124 Access MAX mass spectrometer with a heated electrospray ionization (H-ESI) probe (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chromatographic separation was achieved using Hypersil gold C8 column (5 cm × 2.1 mm I.D., 5 µm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) maintained at 40 °C with a flow rate of 300 µL/min. The mobile phase consisted of A:10 mM ammonium acetate with 500 nM EDTA and 0.1% acetic acid, B: acetonitrile, C: isopropanol, and D: methanol. The elution gradient was: 80% A, 10% B, and 10% D (up to1 min); 50% A, 10% B, 30% C, and 10% D (5–11 min), 10% A, 20% B, 60% C, and 10% D (11–15 min), 5% A, 95% C (15.1–18 min). The SRM under positive mode was utilized for MS detection, and the optimized parameters were as follows: Spray voltage (4000 V), vaporizer temperature (250 °C), capillary temperature (300 °C), and nitrogen was used as the sheath gas and the auxiliary gas with a flow of 40 psi and 55 psi, respectively. Argon was used as the collision gas. Peak alignment, peak integration with smoothing points 7, area noise factor 5, peak noise factor 10, and quantification were performed using Thermo Xcalibur 2.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The total ceramide, hexosylceramide, and sphingomyelin relative levels were determined by the untargeted analysis method established earlier in our laboratory using LTQ-Orbitrap-MS in negative ionization mode29. The details of total lipid extraction, lipid annotation, and relative quantification were provided in supporting information.Statistical analysisTwo-way ANOVA with Tukey or Sidak multiple comparison tests was applied using GraphPad prism 8.0.1 software with a GP value of 0.1234 (ns), 0.0332 (*), 0.0021 (**), 0.0002(***), 0.0001(****). All the data were represented as the mean ± standard error.Ethical statementAll mouse experiments were performed in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines (https://arriveguidelines.org) with prior approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee of Hokkaido University. Further, following the Fundamental Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiment and Related Activities in Academic Research Institutions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan. Body weight losses were monitored daily after infection, and mice were humanely euthanized when weight loss reached 25%.ResultsChange in body weight of mice upon PR8 virus infectionMice were intranasally infected with PR8 virus at a dose of 50 or 500 PFU for models of mild or severe influenza, respectively. Body weight changes were monitored daily until 6 dpi, as shown in Fig. 1c. While control mice had almost unchanged body weights during the observation period, the infected mice in both groups (50 and 500 PFU) showed a significant decrease in the body weight starting at 3 dpi. Body weight loss in mice infected with 50 and 500 PFU of PR8 virus was almost 4% and 13% at 3 dpi, and 17% and 25% at 6 dpi, respectively. In the severe influenza model group (500 PFU), 3 of 5 mice met the criteria for euthanasia because their weight loss reached a humane endpoint (25 %) at 6 dpi. Thus, the survival rate in the group was dropped to 40% at that time point (Fig. 1c). To investigate the effect of influenza virus infection on S1P signalling, plasma and tissues were collected at 1, 3, and 6 dpi for samples at very early-stage, the onset of symptoms, and the lethal phase during influenza, respectively.Alteration of S1P quantity in the liver, lung, and plasma of mice infected with PR8 virusThe quantitative analysis of targeted sphingolipids such as S1P and its precursor sphingosine in the liver and plasma of mice infected with PR8 virus was performed by LC/MS, and their extracted ion chromatograms are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. The S1P levels ranged from 0.19 to 2.64 µmol/L in the plasma and 0.13 to 0.82 pmol/mg in the liver. Sphingosine levels in the plasma and liver ranged from 0.01 to 0.03 µmol/L and 0.34 to 0.80 pmol/mg, respectively. The acquired plasma concentrations of S1P are almost consistent with the previous reports, which showed a wide variance from 0.1 to 0.8 µmol/L30 and 1 to 3 µmol/L14 in mice. In the plasma, the sphingosine levels were unaltered on days 1, 3, and 6 after infection. However, compared to controls, plasma S1P levels were significantly increased by about fivefold at 6 dpi in mice infected with PR8 virus at 500 PFU (Fig. 2a). Conversely, S1P levels in the liver were not significantly altered in both infection groups during the experimental period, and the liver sphingosine content increased 1.5- to 2-fold in mice infected with 50 or 500 PFU of PR8 virus at 6 dpi, compared to controls (Fig. 2b). Additionally, in the lung of infected mice, the levels of S1P were not changed, but a significant increase in those of sphingosine was observed (Fig. 2c). Sphingolipids are known to be involved in multiple signal transduction pathways to exert their diverse biological functions. Hence, the mechanisms under which S1P and sphingosine levels were altered during virus infection need to be further investigated.Figure 2Concentrations of sphingolipids, gene expressions of S1P synthesis (Sphk1), and hydrolysis enzymes (Sgpl1) Concentrations of S1P and its precursor sphingosine in plasma (a), liver (b), and lung (c) of PR8 virus infected mice (n = 5 each, mean ± SE, Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test). Mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS alone or PBS comprising PR8 virus (500 PFU), and liver, e-WAT, lung, heart, and aorta samples were collected at 1, 3, and 6 dpi. Expressions of target genes (d) normalized with that of 18S are presented as fold changes relative to those of the control mice at each time point. Bars represent means ± SEM of 7 or 8 (liver, lung, aorta) or 3 or 4 (e-WAT, heart) animals. White and black bars indicate data from control and PR8 virus-infected mice, respectively; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0005, 2way-ANOVA on ddCt, control vs. PR8 virus-infected mice at each time point.Full size imageAlteration of gene expressions of S1P synthase and hydrolases in mice infected with PR8 virusThe gene expression levels of S1P synthases (Sphk1, Sphk2) and S1P hydrolases (Sgpl1) in the liver, e-WAT, lung, heart, and aorta of mice were measured by real-time PCR under the infection conditions where a significant increase in plasma S1P concentration was observed. In mice infected with PR8 virus at 500 PFU, the gene expression levels of Sphk1 significantly increased by 1.5- to 3.5-fold in the lung, heart, and aorta at 3 dpi and twofold in the liver, e-WAT, heart, and aorta at 6 dpi, compared to controls at each time point (Fig. 2d). However, no apparent changes were observed in Sphk2 levels in all tested tissues (Supplementary Fig. S2). Furthermore, a slight reduction in Sgpl1 levels was observed in the liver of the PR8 virus infected mouse at 6 dpi. In contrast, the Sgpl1 level in lung and e-WAT increased by twofold. Increased expression levels of Sphk1 in multiple tissues indicated the activation of S1P synthesis during influenza. Apart from this, decreased Sgpl1 observed in the liver of infected mice at 6 dpi may have contributed to the suppression of S1P degradation in the tissue; however, the hepatic S1P level was unchanged. Hence, further mechanistic investigations are necessary to elucidate the effect of influenza virus infection on sphingolipid metabolism in the liver.Alteration of gene expression of S1P receptors of mice infected with PR8 virusS1P acts as an intracellular signaling molecule through five S1P-specific G-protein-coupled receptors termed S1PR1-520. These receptors have overlapping or distinct expression patterns and functions in a cell- and tissue-type specific manner, resulting in various physiological functions of S1P in each organ31. The relative gene expressions of three major S1P receptors, S1pr1-3 in the liver, lung, and e-WAT of mice infected with PR8 virus are shown in Fig. 3a. The gene expressions of S1pr1 and S1pr2 significantly decreased by twofold in the liver at 6 dpi, while there was no significant change in S1pr3 levels (Supplementary Fig. S2). Although lung showed a decrease in the expression levels of S1pr3 at 1 dpi, a significant increase up to threefolds was observed at 3 dpi. But the expression levels of S1pr1 and S1pr2 are unaltered in the lung. In contrast to the liver, e-WAT showed a slight increase in the levels of S1pr1 at 6 dpi and S1pr3 at 1 dpi, although S1pr2 levels did not change throughout.Figure 3Expression levels of major S1P receptors (a) and transporters (b) in the liver, lung and e-WAT. Mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS alone or PBS comprising PR8 virus (500 PFU), and liver, e-WAT, lung, heart, and aorta samples were collected at 1, 3, and 6 dpi. Expressions of target genes normalized with that of 18S are presented as fold changes relative to those of the control mice at each time point. Bars represent means ± SEM of 7 or 8 (liver) or 3 or 4 (e-WAT) animals. White and black bars indicate data from control and PR8 virus-infected mice, respectively; *p < 0.05, 2way-ANOVA on ddCt, control vs. PR8 virus-infected mice at each time point.Full size imagePR8 virus infection alters gene expression of S1P transporters in liver, lung, and e-WAT in miceS1P is produced inside the cell and exported via transporters, such as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (Abca1, Abcg2, Abcc1) and sphingolipid transporter 2 (Spns2), to stimulate S1prs on the cell membrane in a paracrine and/or autocrine manner. Therefore, expression levels of S1P transporters indirectly regulate S1P-S1PR signaling. The gene expression levels of Abca1, Abcg2, and Spns2, in the liver, lung, and e-WAT are shown in Fig. 3b. In the liver, Abca1 increased slightly at 3 dpi; however, no significant changes were observed at 1 and 6 dpi. On the other hand, Abcg2 and Spns2 decreased significantly by almost twofold at 6 dpi. Conversely, significant increases in Abca1 and Spns2 levels were observed in e-WAT at 6 dpi in the infected mice, compared to controls. Surprisingly, in the lung, all the three transporters, Abca1, Abcg2, and Spns2 showed a significant decrease at 6 dpi. By the way, another ABC transporter Abcc1 gene expression was not affected in liver, lung, and e-WAT tissues by the virus infection (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results may suggest that the extracellular trafficking of S1P was reduced in the liver and enhanced in the e-WAT.Alteration of complex sphingolipids in the liver, lung, and plasma of mice infected with PR8 virusThe concentrations of other complex sphingolipids of the S1P pathway such as ceramides, hexosylceramide, and sphingomyelin in the liver, lung, and plasma of mice infected with PR8 virus were determined by untargeted LC/MS analysis (Fig. 4). A significant reduction in total ceramide and sphingomyelin levels was detected in the liver, lung, and plasma, particularly at 3 or 6 dpi, respectively. In contrast, the hexosylceramide levels were increased in the liver and lung but unchanged in plasma. These results demonstrate a significant influence of influenza virus infection on sphingolipid metabolism in plasma, liver, and the lung.Figure 4Relative concentrations of total ceramide, hexosylceramide and sphingomyelin in plasma (a), liver (b), and lung (c) of PR8 virus infected mice (n = 5 each, mean ± SE, 2way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0005).Full size imageDiscussionViral infection triggers a specific lipid mediator of the host which, could serve as a potential biomarker to assist diagnostics32, and targeting host-derived lipid mediators appears to be a promising strategy to develop novel antiviral therapeutics33. The significance of an S1P/S1PR1 axis in virus infection has been previously reported27. However, there is little information on the kinetic profile of sphingolipids and S1P signaling in tissues other than the lungs during influenza. Here we investigated the changes of the levels of S1P and its related gene expressions upon PR8 virus infection in mice as summarized in Table 1.Table 1 Summary of altered S1P levels and its pathway related gene expressions (Sph: sphingosine).Full size tableThe present results demonstrate the elevation of plasma S1P in mice with severe influenza (PR8 virus of 500PFU) on 6 dpi when the animals showed almost 25% of their body weight loss, dehydration, and decreased motility. Interestingly, 12-h-fasting has been reported to cause 5.5% body weight loss and to elevate S1P level in the circulation via increased lipid flux in mice34. Therefore, influenza-associated anorexia and consequent body weight decrease due to virus infection may have promoted lipid release from tissues and contributed to the elevation of S1P. However, given that the plasma sphingosine levels were not altered in mice infected with 50PFU and 500PFU PR8 virus for 6 and 3 days, respectively, when the animals showed around 15% weight loss, it is unlikely that S1P levels elevated simply due to increased lipid flow. Therefore, our data clearly indicate an impact of virus infection on S1P signaling rather than fasting-associated lipid release alone. In addition, since S1P is abundantly contained in red blood cells, it is possible that the elevated plasma S1P levels observed in the infected mice were caused by hemolysis. To exclude this possibility, plasma hemoglobin levels were measured, and there was no significant difference in hemoglobin levels between control and infected mice at any time points (Supplementary Fig. S3). Therefore, the increase in plasma S1P levels in infected mice is considered to be associated with changes in S1P metabolism as described below.The increased gene expression of Sphk1, which mediates the conversion of S1P from its precursor sphingosine, was observed in the liver, lung, e-WAT, heart, and aorta of infected mice in this study. This observation is consistent with those in previous studies representing the induction and phosphorylation-dependent activation of SPHK1 by influenza virus infection or inflammatory cytokines in cultured cells (described later in detail)26,35,36. The induction of SPHK1 may result in an increase of S1P synthesis in tissues, which can explain the elevation of blood S1P levels in infected mice in this study and another previous one37. However, it is unclear what tissues and/or cells actually contributed to the elevation of plasma S1P at this moment. Future studies will be needed, and the possibility of increased release of S1P from red blood cells, which are the most important source of S1P in the blood22, should also be examined.In contrast to the plasma, the liver and lung of infected mice showed increased concentration of sphingosine and unchanged S1P on 6 dpi. In this study, we focused on the regulation of Sphk1/2 gene expression, which has been shown to be affected by a viral infection in detail, in order to investigate S1P metabolism during influenza. However, the concentration of sphingosine, a precursor of S1P, was rather increased in the liver of infected mice that showed increased Sphk1 expression. When combined with the fact that ceramide levels in the liver and lung were decreased upon the infection, it seems that not only the production of S1P but also the entire metabolism of sphingolipids is affected in the tissue by influenza virus infection in a complex manner.In addition to the liver, gene expression levels of enzymes involved in S1P metabolism were found to be significantly altered by the infection in the lung. The increase in lung Sgpl1 gene expression observed in this study may suggest the reduction of S1P in the lung. The level of S1P in the lungs tended to decrease at 6 dpi, although the change was not statistically significant. In the endotoxin-induced lung injury model, the induction of Sgpl1 contributes significantly to the decrease in lung S1P concentration induced by endotoxin administration, and the inhibition of SGPL1 activity alleviates the degree of lung injury38. Therefore, the increase in Sgpl1 gene expression observed in this study may also be related to lung injury in influenza. Investigating the effects of viral infection on the expression and activities of S1P and other sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes may enhance our understanding of the host response to infection.The S1P signaling has already been demonstrated to be affected by various infectious diseases through the alteration of expressions or activities of related enzymes, particularly SPHK1. Interestingly, the effects of virus infection on the regulation of S1P are different among viruses. The increased gene expression and enzymatic activity of SPHK1 upon infection with influenza virus, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) have been reported in cultured cell systems26,35,39,40. On the other hand, dengue virus type-2 infection reduces SPHK1 activity through a post-translational mechanism in multiple cell lines41. Considering changes in gene expressions of S1prs and transporters observed in each tissue in this study, S1P signaling was expected to be down-regulated in the liver and up-regulated in the e-WAT in mice with severe influenza. Given the anti-inflammatory function of S1P, we speculate that increased plasma S1P levels can be protective against the infection as demonstrated in previous studies that S1PR1 agonists protected the host from influenza-virus-infection-induced acute immunopathological damages by suppressing inflammatory signaling11,27. However, since activated S1P signaling induces insulin resistance in adipose tissue by promoting inflammation42, the expected changes of S1P signaling in the e-WAT may be associated with energy metabolism disorders in severe influenza reported so far1,7,8. It is also interesting to note that the effect of influenza virus infection on changes in gene expression levels related to sphingolipid metabolism differs among tissues.In addition to the increase in plasma S1P, the decreased levels of ceramide and sphingomyelin in the liver, lung, and plasma or increased level of hexosylceramide in the liver and lung further suggest the alteration of the sphingolipid metabolic pathways during severe influenza. Given the divergent roles of sphingolipids, particularly ceramide in viral infections from the suppression of viral replication to the enhancement of immune responses43,44, further investigation will be needed to elucidate the detailed mechanisms and roles of S1P and other sphingolipids in different tissues during influenza and other infectious diseases.In summary, the present results indicate that influenza virus infection induces Sphk1 gene expression in multiple tissues to elevate the level of circulating S1P at the lethal phase of severe influenza. Understanding the relationship between the influenza virus infection, S1P metabolism, and its signal transduction would provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and host responses.

Sign up for Nature Briefing: Translational ResearchResearch Shows Importance of Timely Flu Vaccination Skip to main content UVA Health logo of UVA Health Newsroom Media Contacts Search Toggle Search for: Search Submit Latest News Media Contacts Publications uvahealth.com October 12, 2021 Research Shows Importance of Timely Flu Vaccination The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges nearly all Americans to get a flu vaccination by the end of October. With flu season approaching in the United States, new research from an international team of scientists testifies to the importance of timely vaccination: Poor timing of influenza vaccination campaigns in the semi-arid region of Brazil led to an increase in premature births, lower birth-weight babies and the need to deliver more babies by cesarean section, the researchers found. The findings, from the University of Virginia School of Medicine and longstanding collaborators at the Federal University of Ceará in Brazil, come as the United States rolls out annual flu vaccines amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say that receiving the flu vaccine will be especially important this year, to reduce the burden on hospitals and intensive care units already overwhelmed by COVID-19. “Working closely with Professor Aldo Lima, UFC graduate student Quirino Filho and Ceará health officials, UVA graduate student Gabriel Hanson and a team of undergraduate BME Capstone students found evidence for circulation of seasonal influenza in the weeks and months prior to the rollout of national flu vaccine campaigns in the state of Ceará,” said researcher Sean Moore, MD, a pediatric gastroenterologist at UVA Children’s and a member of UVA’s Child Health Research Center. “This misalignment was associated with seasonal patterns of premature birth, low birth weight and birth by cesarean.” The Importance of Vaccines Moore teamed with Jason Papin, PhD, of UVA’s Department of Biomedical Engineering, and colleagues in Brazil to better understand the effect of severe respiratory infections on pregnancy. The researchers reviewed severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), influenza and flu vaccinations in the Brazilian state of Ceará between 2013 and 2018.They found that 30 to 40 weeks after the peak of the flu season, birthweights fell and rates of premature births increased from 10.7% to 15.5%. On average, the 61 babies born to mothers who suffered SARI infections weighed 10% less at birth. These alarming trends repeated themselves year after year. The dominant strain during nearly all those years was H1N1. The only exception was 2015, when seasonal H1 strains dominated. That year also saw lower flu death rates than the norm. The researchers note that children exposed to flu and other infections while developing in the womb are at significantly greater risk of neurocognitive, physical and education problems later in life. They conclude that earlier flu vaccination campaigns in Brazil would better protect pregnant women and their babies. Because Ceará is typically the starting point for flu season in Brazil, improving the timing of the vaccination campaigns there could ultimately have benefits across the country. “Brazil is a country with enviably high influenza vaccine uptake — greater than 80% in people at high risk for severe influenza. Our data suggest giving vaccines earlier in the year in Ceará would better protect women during pregnancy and reduce bad outcomes,” Moore said. “Influenza vaccines are not yet recommended in infants under 6 months of age. So when a mother chooses to receive the flu vaccine during pregnancy, she is giving an early gift to her baby. Mom’s vaccine-acquired antibodies are shared with her fetus and persist to help protect her baby against influenza during the vulnerable first months of life.” In short, the new findings have the potential to improve lives in Brazil – and send an important message about the importance of timely vaccination to the rest of the world. That was made possible by an approach combining public health, data science and international collaboration. “The intriguing results from this project demonstrated how data science can help provide insight into complex biomedical problems,” Papin said. “It was incredibly fun and rewarding to work with such a diverse team of biomedical scientists. I’m hopeful that the results here can have a real impact in the health of newborns.” TO GET A FLU SHOT: The federal Centers for Disease Control recommends everyone 6 months and older, with rare exceptions, get a flu vaccine by the end of October. Flu shots are widely available at many locations, including UVA Health, grocery stores, pharmacies and doctor’s offices. Some people who received the Pfizer COVID vaccine may be eligible to get a flu shot at the same as their COVID booster; the CDC advises it is safe to do so. Findings Published The researchers have published their findings in the scientific journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, published by the CDC. The research team consisted of José Q. Filho, Francisco S. Junior, Thaisy B.R. Lima, Vânia A.F. Viana, Jaqueline S.V. Burgoa, Alberto M. Soares, Álvaro M. Leite, Simone A. Herron, Hunter L. Newland, Kunaal S. Sarnaik, Gabriel F. Hanson, Jason A. Papin, Sean R. Moore and Aldo A.M. Lima. The research was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in collaboration with Brazilian federal science agencies in a program called Brazil Grand Challenges Explorations.

Should I get a flu shot this year? Is it COVID-19, the flu or RSV? COVID-19, the flu (or influenza) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are all respiratory illnesses but are caused by different viruses. Symptoms of all are more similar than they are different and may look different in different age groups. All have similar treatments that are based upon supportive care including comfort measures and assuring adequate hydration. What is a cold? Almost everybody is familiar with the sensation of having a cold. The average person will have had many colds from infancy all the way until later life. Symptoms include: Runny nose Sore throat Coughing and sneezing Watery eyes Headache and body aches Little to no fever Cough and congestion do not interfere with ability to eat or sleep. To avoid catching or spreading a cold, you should wash your hands regularly and make sure you sneeze into a tissue or handkerchief, or into their elbow. What is influenza? There are three types of the flu virus: influenza A, influenza B and influenza C. Types A and B are the ones that cause seasonal epidemics. One of the key symptoms of flu is feeling feverish or having a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or above. However, not everyone with the flu will have a fever. Other common symptoms include a fever, fatigue, sore throat and congestion/cough. Common myths about the flu What is RSV? RSV is a common virus that impacts your lungs and breathing. The most common symptom of RSV is copious clearing of your upper airway secretions. This is especially concerning for infants as they physically struggle to clear airway secretions to breathe and to eat. A fever may or may not be present. What parents should know about RSV How to know which virus your child might have? Knowing the exposure your child has had from childcare, school and seeing other family members is very helpful when you need to narrow down symptoms. However, testing is the only definitive way to distinguish what the virus might be. Treatment is typically similar for either of these illnesses. Schedule an appointment for your child if they have symptoms including: Fever over 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Fussiness and decreased sleep. Any respiratory symptoms interfering with the ability to sleep or eat. Decreased urine output. Prevention is key Vaccines are available for influenza and COVID-19 for ages 6 months and older. Vaccines are safe and show significant efficacy in preventing severe disease. Handwashing has continued to be a universal standard in preventing the spread of disease.

Defective interfering particles (DIPs) can arise during IAV infection and inhibit spread of wild type (WT) IAV. DIPs harbor defective RNA segments, termed DI RNAs, that usually contain internal deletions and interfere with replication of WT viral RNA segments. Here, we asked whether DIPs harboring two instead of one DI RNA exert increased antiviral activity. For this, we focused on DI RNAs derived from segments 1 and 3, which encode the polymerase subunits PB2 and PA, respectively. We demonstrate the successful production of DIPs harboring deletions in segments 1 and/or 3, using cell lines that co-express PB2 and PA. Further, we demonstrate that DIPs harboring two instead of one DI RNA do not exhibit increased ability to inhibit replication of a WT RNA segment. Similarly, the presence of two DI RNAs did not augment the induction of the interferon-stimulated gene MxA and the inhibition of IAV infection. Collectively, our findings suggest that the presence of multiple DI RNAs derived from genomic segments encoding polymerase subunits might not result in increased antiviral activity.

Currently available influenza therapy includes M2 ion channel inhibitors (Rimantadine and Amantadine)3, neuraminidase inhibitors (Zanamivir and Oseltamivir)4,5, and an inhibitor of the viral polymerase (Baloxavir marboxil)4,5,6. However, resistance mutations can render these drugs ineffective7. Similarly, vaccines against epidemic influenza have to be reformulated on an annual basis due to antigenic drift of the circulating influenza virus strains and offer little or no protection against newly emerging, pandemic strains8,9. Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of novel prophylactic and therapeutic strategies.Influenza viruses are enveloped and harbor a negative-sense, segmented RNA genome. The viral nucleoprotein (NP) and the trimeric viral polymerase consisting of the subunits polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase basic 2 (PB2) and polymerase acidic (PA) are required for genome replication9,10. Errors made by the viral polymerase during genome replication may result in the production of defective genomic RNAs, which frequently harbor deletions11. Some of these defective RNAs interfere with replication of WT RNAs and the packaging of these defective interfering (DI) RNAs into particles yields DI particles, DIPs11,12. DIPs inhibit infection with WT influenza viruses by interfering with genome replication and by inducing the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), including the MxA gene. DIPs can modulate influenza virus spread in the host and could be developed for antiviral therapy13,14. However, it is at present unclear whether DIPs harboring more than one DI RNA will exert increased antiviral activity as compared to otherwise isogenic DIPs harboring a single DI RNA.We have reported the establishment of a cell culture system which allows the production of DIPs bearing a segment 1-derived DI RNA in the absence of infectious virus15. Here, we modified this system in order to produce DIPs harboring DI RNAs derived from segments 1 and 3. We found that DIPs harboring DI RNAs derived from segments 1 and 3 can be readily generated in this system but do not show augmented antiviral activity as compared to DIPs harboring a single DI RNA.ResultsGeneration of 293T and MDCK cells stably expressing functional PA and PB2In order to determine whether DIPs harboring more than one DI RNA exert increased antiviral activity, we focused on segment 1- and segment 3-derived DI RNAs, since DI RNAs most frequently arise from genomic segments 1–3, which encode polymerase proteins16,17. We have previously generated a cell line that stably expresses PB2 (which is encoded by segment 1) and allows amplification of DIPs harboring segment 1-derived DI RNAs15. For production of DIPs harboring segment 1- and/or 3-derived DI RNAs we employed the same strategy. Thus, we engineered 293 T and MDCK cells to co-express PB2 and PA (encoded by segment 3). Immunoblot analysis revealed that these cells indeed expressed robust levels of the desired proteins (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, the 293T cell line was engineered to express PB1 and expression was readily detectable (Supplemental Fig. 1). In order to analyze whether the PB2, PB1 and PA stably expressed in 293T cells are functional, we used a mini replicon system. This assay measures amplification of a reporter segment (derived from segment 8) encoding luciferase upon co-expression of PB1, PB2, PA and NP18. We found that transfection of this 293T cell line with a plasmid encoding the IAV reporter segment yielded background levels of luciferase activity, while co-transfection of these cells with plasmids encoding the reporter segment and PB2, PB1, PA and NP increased luciferase activity more than 1000-fold (Fig. 1B). Notably, the omission of plasmids encoding PB2, PB1 and PA did not appreciably reduce reporter activity (Fig. 1B); demonstrating that our 293T cell line expressed functional PB2, PB1 and PA. Comparable functionality could not be analyzed for the MDCK cell line expressing PA and PB2 due to low transfection efficiency (not shown).Figure 1Characterization of MDCK and 293 T cells stably expressing IAV polymerase proteins. (A) Expression of PB2 and PA in MDCK and 293 T cells was analyzed by immunoblot. Detection of β-actin served as a loading control. Lysates from MDCK WT/MDCK PB2/PA and 293 T WT/293 T PB1/PB2/PA cells were loaded on three gels. Blots were exposed for 50 s for detection of PB2 in 293 T cells and for 30 s for detection in MDCK cells while exposure of 50 s was required for detection of β-actin. The exposure for detection of PA in 293 T and MDCK cells was 50 s and 10 s, respectively. (B) 293 T cells stably expressing PB2, PB1, and PA were transiently co-transfected with the indicated combinations of plasmids encoding PB2, PB1, PA and NP and an IAV luciferase reporter segment. Luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined at 24 h post transfection. Luciferase activity measured for cells co-transfected with all plasmids was set as 100%. The average of three independent experiments is shown. Error bars indicate SEM. Two tailed paired student t-test was used to assess statistical significance. p < 0.05 = **, p < 0.005 = ***, ns: not significant.Full size imagePB2 and PA co-expressing cell lines allow production of DIPs harboring segment 1- and/or segment 3-derived DI RNAsWe next explored whether the generated stable cell lines allowed production of DIPs harboring a segment 1-derived DI RNA (S1 DIP), a segment 3-derived DI RNA (S3 DIP) or a segment 1- and a segment 3-derived DI RNA (S1S3 DIP), employing the experimental setup depicted in Fig. 2A. For DIP production, segment 1- and 3-derived derived DI RNAs with an internal deletion of 1248 nts (S1) and 1193 nts (S3) were chosen based on our unpublished findings indicating that these DI RNAs induce replication interference and are compatible with robust DIP production. Quantification of DIP infectivity by focus formation assay revealed titers of roughly 107 ffu/mL for S1 and S3 DIPs and 104 ffu/mL for S1S3 DIPs (Fig. 2B). In contrast, no DIPs were produced when 293T WT and MDCK WT cells were used for production (Fig. 2B). Next, we sought to confirm the incorporation of S1 and S3 DI RNAs into DIPs via segment specific RT-PCR. The RT-PCR yielded bands of the expected sizes, 1032 bp for S1 DI RNA, 2.28 kbp for WT segment 1, 958 bp for S3 DI RNA and 2.151 kbp for segment 3 WT. Importantly, S1 DI RNA but not WT segment 1 was detected in S1 DIPs and the corresponding observation was made for WT segment 3 and S3 DIPs (Fig. 2C). Similarly, S1 DI RNA and S3 DI RNA but not the corresponding WT segments were detected in S1S3 DIPs, confirming the purity of our DIP preparations (Fig. 2C). Thus, the newly established cell lines allowed production of S1, S3 and S1S3 DIPs harboring the desired DI RNAs.Figure 2Production of DIPs from complementing cell lines. (A) Work flow for production and quantification of DIPs harboring segment 1- and 3-derived DI RNAs. For production of DIPs, a co-culture of 293T and MDCK cells stably expressing at least two IAV polymerase proteins was co-transfected with plasmids encoding WT IAV genomic segments 2 and 4–8 as well as segments 1 and 3 containing internal deletions that convert these segments into DI RNAs. Supernatants were harvested at the indicated time points.

Supernatants were harvested on days 3, 5 and 7-post transfection. Titers were determined by focus formation assay using PA/PB2 MDCK cells. The average of three independent experiments is shown. Error bars indicate SEM. (C) DI RNA incorporation into DIPs. Supernatants containing DIPs harboring DI RNAs derived from segment 1 (S1) or 3 (S3) or harboring both DI RNAs (S1S3) were analyzed by RT-PCR. Plasmids encoding wt segments S1, S3 or the corresponding DI RNAs served as positive control. A single representative experiment is shown. Results were confirmed in four independent experiments.Full size imageCo-expression of S1 and S3 DI RNAs does not augment inhibition of segment replicationDI RNAs suppress replication of WT IAV genomic segments and we investigated whether combining S1 DI RNA and S3 DI RNA increases inhibitory activity as compared to the single DI RNAs. For this purpose, we employed the mini replicon assay as described above but used 293T WT cells. Transfection of 293T cells with the IAV reporter segment alone yielded background levels of luciferase activity, while cotransfection of these cells with plasmids encoding the reporter, IAV polymerase proteins and NP yielded luciferase levels 1000-fold over background. Additional cotransfection of plasmids encoding S1 DI RNA or S3 DI RNA at two concentrations resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of luciferase activity, with S1 DI RNA showing a stronger inhibitory effect as compared to S3 DI RNA (Fig. 3). Further, cotransfection of plasmids encoding both DI RNAs did not result in further decrease of luciferase activity as compared to that measured for S1 DI RNA alone (Fig. 3), indicating that the presence of two DI RNAs did not increase replication interference in the mini replicon assay.Figure 3The presence of two DI RNAs does not increase inhibition of genome replication. 293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated combinations of plasmids encoding the viral polymerase proteins, NP, a segment 8-based luciferase reporter and the indicated DI RNAs at 10 (gray bars) and 300 ng (green checkered bars). Luciferase activity was determined at 24 h posttransfection. The results of single round DI RNA induced replication inhibition are shown. The average of three independent experiments is shown. Error bars indicate SEM. Two tailed paired student t-test was used to assess statistical significance. p < 0.005 = ***, ns: not significant.Full size imageS1S3 DIPs do not induce MxA expression with increased efficiency as compared to S1 or S3 DIPsDIPs can inhibit heterologous viruses by inducing the IFN system19. Therefore, we assessed whether the presence of two DI RNAs as compared to one effected a stronger induction of MxA expression, an IFN stimulated gene. Interferon α or infection with A/WSN/33 induced MxA expression at least 100-fold, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4). S1 and S3 DIPs induced MxA with similar efficiency as A/WSN/33, but MxA induction was not augmented when S1S3 DIPs harboring two DI RNAs were studied (Fig. 4). Thus, combining S1 and S3 DI RNA in DIPs did not enhance induction of MxA expression.Figure 4The presence of two DI RNAs does not increase MxA induction. Calu-3 cells were either treated with interferon α or inoculated with IAV (A/WSN/33) or DIPs at an MOI of 0.1. Cell lysates were harvested 24 h after treatment or infection, RNA was isolated and MxA expression was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR. MxA transcript levels were normalized against transcript levels of β-actin. The average of three independent experiments is shown as x-fold over actin. Error bars indicate SEM. Two tailed paired student t-test was used to assess statistical significance. p < 0.5 = *, ns: not significant.Full size imageS1S3 DIPs do not show increased antiviral activity as compared to S1 or S3 DIPsWe finally investigated whether the presence of two DI RNAs increases DIP antiviral activity, i.e. the ability to suppress replication of WT IAV in target cells. For this, we used MDCK cells, a dog cell line frequently used to propagate IAV. Furthermore, we employed the human lung cell line Calu-3 as a mimic of human respiratory epithelium. In order to assess DIP antiviral activity in these cell lines, different DIP dilutions were either added 24 h prior to virus (24 h setting) or DIP and virus were added at the same time (0 h setting).Addition of DIPs at 24 h prior to virus resulted in increased antiviral activity in both MDCK and Calu-3 cells as compared to co-inoculation of cells with virus and DIP (Fig. 5). Further, S1 DIP showed increased antiviral activity as compared to S3 DIP in keeping with the increased inhibitory activity of S1 relative to S3 DI RNA in the minireplicon assay. Finally, the antiviral activity of S1S3 DIPs was comparable to that of the S1 DIP (Fig. 5), demonstrating that under the conditions chosen the presence of two DI RNAs instead of one did not augment antiviral activity.Figure 5The presence of two DI RNAs does not increase antiviral activity. (A) MDCK cells were either co-inoculated with A/WSN/33 and the indicated DIPs at the indicated dilutions (solid bars) or cells were preincubated with DIPs for 24 h before virus was added (checkered bars). Infectivity was measured at 72 h post infection. The Log transformed average of five independent experiments is shown. Error bars indicate SEM. (B) The experiment was carried out as described for panel A but Calu-3 cells were used as targets. The log transformed average of three independent experiments is shown. Error bars indicate SEM. Two tailed paired student T-test was used to assess statistical significance. p < 0.5 = *, p < 0.05 = **, ns: not significant.Full size imageDiscussionDIPs are naturally occurring byproducts of IAV replication. They contain DI RNAs that inhibit IAV infection and could be developed for antiviral intervention11,13,20. However, it is unclear whether the presence of two DI RNAs within DIPs can augment antiviral activity as compared to otherwise isogenic counterparts. Here, we demonstrate that cell lines expressing PB2 and PA allow the generation of DIPs harboring segment 1- and 3-derived DI RNAs in the absence of WT virus. Moreover, we provide evidence that the presence of two DI RNAs does not enhance interferon induction and antiviral activity.In our current study we chose to produce IAV DIPs with deletions in segments 1 and 3, since DI RNAs preferentially arise from segments 1, 2 and 316,17. Further, we chose DI RNAs with medium sized internal deletions that result in readily detectable but not maximal antiviral activity (not shown). This approach was used to ensure that a possible potentiation of DIP antiviral activity due to the presence of two DI RNAs was readily detectable. In addition, it allowed us to attain DIP titers suitable for experimentation. Thus, increasing the deletion size does not only increase antiviral activity but also reduces the efficiency of DIP production (not shown), most likely due to DIP auto-inhibition21 and this problem was circumvented using the above described strategy.DIPs may interfere with IAV infection in two ways. They are robust activators of the IFN system and potent inducers of ISGs, and the antiviral activity of ISG products is believed to contribute to DIP antiviral activity22. Moreover, the smaller size of DIP RNAs allows them to replicate faster than the corresponding WT DI RNAs, hence allowing DIPs to outcompete WT virus for cellular resources that limit genome replication13. We would have expected that the presence of two DI RNAs might increase sensing of DIP by RIG1 and MDA5 and/or might augment the DIP-induced limitation of resources for genome replication, which both should result in increased antiviral activity23. However, the presence of two DI RNAs did augment neither inhibition of genome replication nor induction of MxA or antiviral activity.At present, we can only speculate why the presence of two DI RNAs did not increase antiviral activity. One potential explanation could be the above-mentioned auto-inhibition. The rescue of S1S3 DIPs yielded 100-fold lower titers as compared to S1 or S3 DIPs, in keeping with potentially increased self-inhibiting capacity of S1S3 DIPs relative to S1 or S3 DIPs. Thus, it is conceivable that auto-inhibitory activity might not only have limited S1S3 amplification in the complementary cell lines used for DIP production, but might also have limited S1S3 DIP amplification in IAV co-infected cultures, thereby limiting DIP antiviral activity. Meng and colleagues have demonstrated that S1-derived DI RNAs may inhibit the replication of S1, S2, and S3 segments24. Hence, it is possible that S3 DI RNA replication is limited by the presence of S1 DI RNA in cells inoculated with S1S3 DIP. Finally, it is noteworthy that our findings are consistent with work from Zhao and colleagues who showed that simultaneous expression of S1-, S2- and S3-derived DI RNAs did not enhance antiviral activity relative to the single DI RNAs both in cell culture and in animals25.In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the presence of two DI RNAs in IAV DIPs does not enhance antiviral activity. This finding should contribute to current efforts to develop DIPs for antiviral activity and might promote our understanding of the role of DIP in IAV spread and pathogenesis.Materials and methodsPlasmids and oligonucleotidesSequences of PB1 and PA were optimized for efficient human and influenza A virus codon usage and for maximal divergence from original sequences to reduce the potential for recombination with WT viral sequences26. Optimized sequences were synthesized (GeneArt, Germany) and subcloned via NotI and XhoI into pQCXIP-mcs27. For insertion of alternative selections markers, we used a derivative vector, pQCXIP-Cherry-mcs, where a puromycin resistance-mCherry fusion gene had been inserted into pQCXIP-mcs using an EcoRV site in the vector and introducing a MunI site upstream of the puromycin resistance gene. The puromycin resistance-mCherry fusion was then replaced by the neomycin (from pcDNA3), hygromycin (from pGL4.32) and blasticidin (pcDNA6/TR) resistance genes, to give pQCXIN-mcs, pQCXIHy-mcs and pQCXIBL-mcs, respectively. Using these vectors, the retroviral plasmids pQCXIN-PB2opt, pQCXIBL-PAopt and pQCXIHy-PB1opt were generated by subcloning the respective genes via NotI and XhoI.Plasmids to rescue influenza virus strains PR8wt26,28 and WSN28 have been published. To generate segment 1 (S1) derived DIPs with intermediate size regions encompassing the packaging regions (1032 bp, 356 bp 5’, 550 bp 3’), we used splice overlap PCR using primers fluA AarI-PB2-1G (5- CGATCACCTGCTCGAGGGAGCGAAAGCAGGTC)/ DIP-448-rev (5- CCCACTGTATTGGCCTCTTAAGCGGCCGCTGCGGTACCGGATCCCCGACGTATTTTGACTTG) and DIP-448-for (5- CAAGTCAAAATACGTCGGGGATCCGGTACCGCAGCGGCCGCTTAAGAGGCCAATACAGTGGG)/fluA AarI-PB2-2341R (5- CGATCACCTGCTCTCTATTAGTAGAAACAAGGTCGTTT). The generation of segment 3 (S3) derived DIPs with intermediate size regions encompassing the packaging regions of the respective segments (958 bp, 447 bp 5’, 484 bp 3’), also employed splice-overlap PCR using primers fluA AarI-PA1-1 (5- CGATCACCTGCTCGAGGGAGCAAAAGCAGGTAC-3)/ DIPS3-447mcs-rev (5- CATCTCCATTCCCCATTTTTAAGCGGCCGCTGCGGTACCAGATCTCTCAGATTTAATTTTATT-3) and DIPS3-447mcs-for (5-AATAAAATTAAATCTGAGAGATCTGGTACCGCAGCGGCCGCTTAAAAATGGGGAATGGAGATG-3)/fluA AarI-PA1-2233R (5- CGATCACCTGCTCTCTATTAGTAGAAACAAGGTACTT-3). Both assembled fragments were cloned into pHW2000GGAar by Golden Gate cloning as described earlier29. Sequences for S1 and S3 DI RNAs are provided in the Supplemental Fig. 2). Plasmids for expression of PB1, PB2, PA and NP15 were generated by PCR amplification of the coding sequences from IAV strain lvPR830 and cloning into pCAGGS31.Cells and virusesAll cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells (MDCK) were obtained from the U. Reichl (MPI for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems, Magdeburg)15 and incubated in Glasgow Minimum Essential Medium (GMEM; Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAN Biotech), penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (pen/strep; PAN Biotech). MDCK PB2/PA cells were cultured in the presence of 1.5 µg/ml puromycin and 500 µg/ml neomycin respectively. 293 T cells were obtained from the DSMZ, Braunschweig, and maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco) containing 10% FBS and pen/strep (ACC 635). 293T PB2/PB1/PA cells were grown in the presence of 1.5 µg/ml puromycin, 500 µg/ml neomycin and 5 µg/ml blasticidin. These cells were engineered to coexpress PB1 in order to allow production of DIPs harboring up to three DI RNAs within future studies. Calu-3 cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with 10% FBS, pen/strep, 1 × non-essential amino acid solution (10 × stock, PAA) and 10 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The identity of 293T and Calu-3 cells was confirmed by STR typing32. Species specificity of MDCK cells was confirmed by cytB sequencing33. Identity of all cell lines was also confirmed by morphological assessment. Finally, cell lines were regularly screened for mycoplasma contamination.Influenza A virus A/WSN/33 adapted to spread in A549 cells was obtained from the strain repository of the IVM Muenster and used to assess antiviral activity of DIPs34. We also used a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) that expresses a dual reporter consisting of eGFP and firefly luciferase from an additional transcription unit located between the open-reading frames for the viral glycoprotein and polymerase35.Production of retroviral vectorsFor the production of MLV particles, 293 T cells were seeded in T25 flasks at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml in DMEM. The next day, cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate transfection method with 6 µg of retroviral vector pQCXIP-PB2opt, pQCXIN-PB2opt, pQCXIBL-PAopt, or pQCXIHy-PB1opt along with 3 µg MLV-gag-pol plasmid and 3 µg VSV-G expression plasmid36,37. At 48 h post transfection, supernatant containing the MLV particles was harvested and cleared by passaging through a 0.45 µm filter and stored at − 80 °C for further use.Transduction and selection of cell lines96 well plates were seeded with 5,000 (MDCK) or 10,000 (293 T) cells/well in 50 µl of cell culture medium. MLV transduction particles (100 µl per well) were added the next day followed by spinoculation at 4,000 × g for 30 min to enhance transduction efficiency. At 48 h post transduction, transduced cells were detached and seeded in 24 well plates in culture media supplemented with antibiotics. Selection was continued until untransduced control cells had died.To generate double transduced cells, transductions were performed in sequential order by first transducing PB2 gene followed by selection. Expression of PB2 was confirmed by western blot. Subsequently, PB2 expressing cells were transduced for further expression of PB1 and PA proteins. For selection of stable cell lines, 1 µg/ml and 1.5 µg/ml of puromycin was used for 293T cells and MDCK cells respectively, and 500 µg/ml neomycin, and 5 µg/ml blasticidin were used for both 293 T cells and MDCKs.ImmunoblotMDCK and 293T cells stably expressing the IAV polymerase proteins were seeded in 6 well plates at a cell density of 2 × 105 cells/well. The next day, cells were harvested, lysed in 200 µL of Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer (5% glycerin, 1% SDS, 2.5% ß-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Bromophenol blue, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M Tris pH 6.8) and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. For each sample, 10 µL were loaded on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and separated via SDS-PAGE. Proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE health care) using a Mini-PROTEAN Tetra Cell (BioRad). Membranes were blocked by incubation in 5% skim milk diluted in PBS-0.1% Tween (PBS-T) for 1 h. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against PB2 (1:1,000, GeneTex, Irvine, USA), PB1 (1:1,000, GeneTex) or PA (1:500, GeneTex). For analysis of the expression of ß-actin, membranes were cut at 50 kDa prior to staining with ß-actin antibody (1:1,000, Sigma-Aldrich). Incubation with primary antibodies was done overnight at 4 °C. The next day, membranes were washed three times in PBS-T and incubated with anti-rabbit HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000, Dianova) for one-hour at room temperature, followed by additional washing steps in PBS-T. In order to visualize protein bands, chemiluminescent substrate HRP juice plus (PJK) was added to the membranes and signals recorded with a ChemoCam imager (Intas).Minireplicon assay293T cells were seeded in 12 well plates at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected following an established protocol15 Briefly, cells were cotransfected with pCAGGS plasmids encoding PB1 (10 ng), PB2 (10 ng), PA (10 ng), NP (100 ng), reporter segment encoding firefly luciferase (50 ng) and plasmid encoding a DI RNA or an empty plasmid (concentrations indicated in figures). Cells were washed 6 h post transfection and fresh DMEM was added. After 24 h post transfection, cells were harvested and firefly luciferase activity was measured by using a Beetle-Juice Luciferase substrate (PJK). The values were recorded on a Plate Chameleon V reader (Hidex) using Microwin 2000 software.Production of DIPsT25 flasks were seeded with a coculture of 293T cells stably expressing PB1, PB2, PA (1.4 × 106 cells) and MDCK cells stably expressing PB2 and PA (0.4 × 106 cells) in DMEM growth medium (Gibco). For the production of DIPs encoding two DI segments derived from IAV genomic segments 1 and 3 (S1S3 DIPs), cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding DI RNA derived from segments 1 and 3 of PR8 origin, jointly with plasmids encoding IAV genomic segments 2 and 4 to 8 of WSN origin using the calcium phosphate method. Similarly, for production of DIPs expressing single DI segments with a deletion in segment 1 (S1 DIPs) or segment 3 (S3 DIPs), cells were cotransfected with 7 IAV genomic segments and either one DI segment derived from S1 (for S1 DIPs) or one derived from S3 (for S3 DIPs). After overnight incubation, cells were washed once with PBS and fresh DMEM infection medium (2% FBS, 1% pen/strep, without trypsin) was added. As negative control, parental MDCK and 293T cells were also transfected. Supernatants were harvested at 3, 5 and 7 days post transfection, cleared by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min and stored at − 80 °C for further use. Titers for DIP supernatants were determined by focus formation assay on PB2, PA expressing MDCK cells, as described15.Characterization of DIP integrityIntegrity of DIPs was controlled by segment-specific RT-PCR. For the isolation of viral RNA from DIPs, 1.5 mL of DIP supernatant were centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 2 h and total viral RNA from the resulting pellet was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 0.1 µg RNA was used as template for cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher Scientific). cDNAs corresponding to S1, S3 or S1S3 DIPs was amplified using segment specific PCR employing published primers38 fluA PB2-1 (5-AGCRAAAGCAGGTCAATTATATTCA)/ fluA PB2-2341R (5-AGTAGAAACAAGGTCGTTTTTAAACTA) for S1 and fluA PA-1 (5- AGCRAAAGCAGGTACTGATYCGAAATG)/ fluA PA-2233R (5- AGTAGAAACAAGGTACTTTTTTGGACA) for S3.Antiviral activity of DIPsIn order to assess antiviral activity of DIPs, MDCK cells were seeded at a concentration of 10,000 cells/well in 96 well plates and co-infected with A/WSN/33 (MOI 0.1) or VSV (MOI 0.01) jointly with DIPs (MOI 1 and tenfold dilutions) for one hour in GMEM growth medium. Alternatively, cells were incubated with the DIPs 24 h prior to infection with A/WSN/33 or VSV. Co-infected cells were washed one hour post coinfection and GMEM growth medium was added. Supernatants were harvested 72 h post coinfection and infectious titer was quantified by focus formation assay on MDCK cells, as described39. For analysis of DIP antiviral activity in Calu-3 cells, cells were seeded at 20,000 cells/well in 96 well plates in MEM growth medium and either co-infected with A/WSN/33 (MOI 0.001) and DIPs (MOI 0.1 and tenfold dilutions) or preincubated with DIPs 24 h prior to infection with A/WSN/33. After one hour, co-exposed cells were washed and MEM growth medium was added. Supernatants were harvested 72 h post infection and infectious titer was quantified by focus formation assay on MDCK cells.Quantitative real time PCR analysisThe induction of MxA by S1, S3 and S1S3 DIPs was assessed by qRT PCR. For this, Calu-3 cells were seeded in 12 well plates at 4 × 105 cells/well and inoculated with A/WSN/33 (MOI 0.1), DIPs (S1, S3 or S1S3 MOI 0.1) or pan-IFNα (100 U/ml, PBL Assay Science) in MEM. As negative controls, cells were treated with fresh MEM or control supernatants obtained by using parental MDCK and 293T cells for DIP rescue. Following inoculation, cells were incubated for one hour, then washed once with PBS, and cultured in fresh MEM. At 24 h post treatment, cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was treated with RNase free DNase (New England BioLabs, NEB) and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. For cDNA synthesis, 0.5 µg of RNA was used as template using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher Scientific), following the protocol for random hexamers in a total volume of 20 µl. Subsequently, 1 µl of cDNA was analyzed utilizing the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen). All samples were tested in triplicates on a Rotorgene Q device (Qiagen) for transcript levels of ß-actin (ACTB, internal transcript control) and myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA, interferon-stimulated gene) using published primers 40. Transcript levels were calculated from cycle thresholds (Ct values) and data are shown as fold change expression of MxA relative to ACTB. The differential fold expression of the target gene over the internal control was calculated using the Livak method41 as 2-ΔΔCt where: ΔCt = average Ct (target gene/MxA) – average Ct ( reference gene/ACTB) and ΔΔCt = ΔCt (values for experimental conditions) –ΔCt (values for control conditions).Statistical testingStudents two tailed t-test was applied for statistical testing. p < 0.5 = *, p < 0.05 = **, p < 0.005 = ***, ns: not significant.

Back to Healio A cell-based influenza vaccine was 54% effective among children during three recent influenza seasons and provided protection regardless of previous vaccination status, according to the results of a randomized clinical trial. Most influenza vaccines — including approximately 82% of this year’s U.S. supply — are still manufactured using egg-based technology. These vaccines prevent disease, but their effectiveness is “frequently suboptimal,” researchers on the new international, multi-institution study wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine. The reduced effectiveness has been linked to adaptations resulting from the production method. Vaccines based on viruses grown in a cell culture instead of an egg have shown promise. Only one cell-based vaccine, Flucelvax Quadrivalent (IIV4c, Seqirus), is approved for use in the U.S. A previous phase 3 trial demonstrated that the vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic in children, “but the efficacy of the vaccine against clinical influenza disease in children and adolescents has not been confirmed in a randomized clinical trial,” researchers wrote in the new study. They tested IIV4c in a phase 3/4 trial to determine its effectiveness among more than 4,500 children and adolescents aged between 2 and 18 years who were randomly assigned to receive either the influenza vaccine or a meningococcal vaccine. The study took place in eight countries over the course of the 2017 Southern Hemisphere influenza season and the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons. Of the 4,509 participants, 65.9% had received an influenza vaccine prior to the study, and 50.7% were between the ages of 2 and 9 years. Following the inoculation, researchers phoned participants weekly during each season, asking for reports on influenza-like symptoms like fever, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion. Those who reported symptoms were then swabbed and tested for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B. Of the 4,509 pediatric participants in the cohort, 1,576 reported influenza-like systems from more than 2 weeks after their vaccination to the end of the season, with 539 being confirmed as having laboratory-tested influenza. Altogether, IIV4c was found to be 54.6% effective overall against confirmed influenza (95% CI, 45.7%-62.1%), including 80.7% effective against influenza A/H1N1 (95% CI, 69.2%-87.9%), 42.1% effective against influenza A/H3N2 (95% CI, 20.3%-57.9%), and 47.6% effective against influenza B (95% CI, 31.4%-60%). Efficacy against any culture-confirmed strain regardless of antigenic match was 60.8% (95% CI, 51.3%-68.5%). Against antigenically matched strains, it was 63.6% (95% CI, 53.6%-71.5%). “Influenza vaccine manufacturing platforms that do not rely on eggs offer certain advantages, including avoidance of egg-adaptive hemagglutinin mutations and a shorter response time when a new influenza virus emerges,” the researchers wrote.

Is weather really responsible for the cold and flu? By Hillary Andrews Source FOX Weather Facebook Twitter Email Copy Link A girl wearing a snowsuit, hat and gloves lies in the snow in Wilkes-Barre, PA. (Aimee Dilger/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) / Getty Images)Yes, we’ve all been told by parents, teachers, grandparents, "Don’t go out with a wet head, you’ll catch pneumonia," and "Wear a hat, or you’ll come down with a cold." But, what really happens? We are not the only ones who have questioned the sage advice.Let’s start with the flu. Does cold weather give you the flu? The short answer is no. The flu, the influenza virus, becomes airborne in water droplets when someone sneezes or coughs. We all know after 2020 to stay six feet away from someone with the flu. The CDC says that the influenza virus can live on hands and surfaces that we touch and infect us when we touch a mucus membrane like our eyes, mouth, or nose. Point for no hat — you can’t catch flu through the top of your head. So why do we link the flu with weather and seasons? Seasonal flu shot clinics are popping up around every corner. An article by a Harvard Ph.D. student even suggested that the word influenza translates in Italian to influenza di freddo, which means "influence of the cold." There must be something linking cold weather and illness. (FOX Weather)The Harvard student looked at an experiment from a researcher who decided to test the "cold from cold" theory. He had groups of guinea pigs (which can be infected by influenza) in separate cages with the same airflow. If no guinea pig had the flu virus initially, none would have the flu at the end of the experiment at which the rodents were kept at 41 °F, 68 °F and 86 °F—point for no hat.He then infected guinea pigs in cage one only. Surprise, cage two guinea pigs caught the flu. He did this at different temperatures and relative humidity. At 41° and 35% relative humidity, the transmission was 100% -- everyone was sick At 41° and 80% relative humidity, the transmission was only 50% At 68° and 35% relative humidity, the transmission was still 100% At 68° and 80% relative humidity, the transmission was 25% -- only one guinea pig got sick At 86° degrees under low and higher humidity levels, the transmission rate was 0% -- no one was sick At 41° and 35% relative humidity, the transmission was 100% -- everyone was sickAt 41° and 80% relative humidity, the transmission was only 50%At 68° and 35% relative humidity, the transmission was still 100%At 68° and 80% relative humidity, the transmission was 25% -- only one guinea pig got sickAt 86° degrees under low and higher humidity levels, the transmission rate was 0% -- no one was sickThe National Institutes of Health explains that scientists took this further and paired weather data from 78 sites worldwide (between 1° and 60° latitude) with historical influenza activity rates from 1975 and 2008. With 75% to 87% accuracy, they found that the flu was most common one month after a month with the lowest specific humidity (ratio of water vapor to air), which coincided with the lowest temperatures. More specifically, the NIH said, "In places where monthly specific humidity dropped below about 11 to 12 grams of water per kilogram of air and temperatures sank below 18º to 21ºC for at least a month, flu activity peaked in winter." Again, point for no hat.However, in the tropics, scientists found the highest flu rates in the most humid and rainy months of the year, getting more than six inches per month of precipitation. Flu is also tougher to transmit in the humid tropics because the water droplet around the virus is smaller and lighter, making it more likely to travel further and longer on air currents and stay airborne longer, says the NIH. No points awarded.Mom did score a few points with some corollary advice:Take your vitamins -- Shorter days mean less sunshine and lower vitamin D levels. Low vitamin D levels are associated with increased autoimmunity and increased susceptibility to infection.Don’t touch that. You don’t know where it’s been -- People spend more time indoors in the cold, allowing those near spread viruses.Use a humidifier -- The CDC says that moisture actually helps keep our mucous membranes healthier and producing mucus, the protective barrier.Bundle up. You’ll catch your death of a cold -- Temperatures below 98.6 degrees in the nose inhibited immune responses in the mucus membrane of mice allowing the virus to replicate faster and more efficiently claimed in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.That leaves four points for mom and the hat and three for no hat — she’s right again.

How to tell the difference Follow the latest COVID-19 dataLearn moreCOVID-19The Big IF StudyNews & ResearchZOE NutritionDownloadDo I have COVID or the flu? How to tell the differenceOctober 11, 2021This article has not been updated recentlyWhat is the flu?How is flu different from COVID-19?Should I be worried about the flu this year?What should I do to avoid catching the flu?How effective are flu jabs and should I get one?Help vital research by logging your flu jabSome researchers are predicting that due to low levels of social contact and potentially low levels of immunity, we could be headed for a bad flu season this winter. So hereâs what you need to know about the flu, its symptoms, and how to keep yourself safe this winter.Â What is the flu?Flu is a contagious respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses. There are two main types of flu virus, along with various subtypes, and they can jump between humans and animals. Like COVID-19, flu is spread by droplets released when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.Â Right now, itâs thought the symptoms of flu include fever, body aches, fatigue, cough, sore throat, headache, loss of appetite, and sometimes an upset stomach.Â Â Although the disease is relatively mild for most people, it can be more severe for very young children, frail older people, and people with underlying illnesses. In some cases, flu can cause severe complications, including pneumonia, which can be fatal. How is flu different from COVID-19?Flu and COVID-19 are caused by two different and very distinct viruses. However, they do cause similar symptoms. As we know, thanks to ZOE COVID Study app contributors,Â the most common COVID-19 symptoms include headache, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, fever, and cough, which are all common flu symptoms. So how do we tell the difference?Our research shows that loss of smell (anosmia) or loss of taste is still one of the most important predictors of testing positive for COVID-19, so itâs an important symptom to look out for.Â Â Even if youâre vaccinated, you can still catch COVID-19. COVID symptoms can feel a lot like a cold or the flu - if youâre newly unwell we recommend you get a PCR test to rule COVID out. If youâre a ZOE COVID Study contributor and report any of the 20+ symptoms consistent with COVID-19, youâll be offered a test through the app.If youâre feeling unwell for any reason - whether itâs a cold, flu or COVID-19 - itâs a good idea to stay home and avoid spreading your germs to others.Should I be worried about the flu this year?Every year, winter flu outbreaks hospitalise thousands of people in the UK. The number of flu-related deaths varies each year, depending on which strains of the virus are circulating.Â In a typical year, around 7,000 people die in the UK as a result of flu with most deaths happening in people over 65. However, in a bad flu year, deaths can reach 25,000 or more.Â Â Over the past two winters, COVID measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing and lockdowns have reduced flu outbreaks. Last winter, only 40 hospitalisations due to influenza were reported across England.With low levels of circulating flu over the past couple of years, experts are speculating that our immunity against influenza viruses has diminished. As COVID restrictions are lifted, increased virus circulation combined with low immunity levels could mean we are in for a bad flu season this year.Â What can I do to avoid catching the flu?The best way to protect yourself against the severe effects of flu is to get a flu vaccination.Â In an attempt to mitigate the effects of flu this winter, the government have extended the free annual flu vaccination program to include more people than in previous years, including over 50s, children aged 2-16, pregnant women, people with underlying health problems, people in residential care, health and social care workers, and carers.Â Â If you arenât eligible for a free flu vaccine, you may still be able to pay to receive one at your local pharmacy. The flu jab takes 10-14 days to become effective, so it is best to plan ahead and get your jab early, before the flu season starts.Â To protect yourself from flu, you should also practice the basic public health measures we have relied upon in the fight against COVID. This means frequent hand washing, covering your mouth if you cough or sneeze, mask-wearing, maintaining a social distance and staying home if you are sick.How effective are flu jabs and should I get one?The influenza virus that causes flu mutates quickly and can jump between species, causing rapid changes that can help it evade immune responses. New flu vaccines are made each year to target the strains of influenza that are currently circulating. However, because the jab is based on predictions, effectiveness can vary.Despite this uncertainty, the flu jab is very safe and is still the best way to protect yourself and others against the flu. The vaccine reduces your risk of contracting and spreading major flu strains. Even if you are unlucky and still contract the flu after getting the jab, it is likely to be much milder than if you were unvaccinated. Even though vaccination may not be 100% effective, it is still well worth getting your flu jab.Â Help vital research by logging your flu jabThe ZOE COVID study is ideally placed to monitor flu, and this year we will be using your symptom reports to track the impacts of both COVID-19 and flu. We have updated the app so you can log your flu jab alongside your COVID vaccinations, which will help us monitor how vaccines impact the spread of flu and COVID-19.Â Flu is just the start of our expanded studies and soon weâll be looking into a wider range of health concerns as part of our wider health studies programme. To take part in these studies, youâll need to opt in via the app. So head to the app today, opt in on the home menu and keep an eye out for new studies.If you havenât already, download the app, log your vaccines and take a few minutes each day to report how youâre feeling, so we can help beat COVID and winter flu.Text LinkDiscover more about your healthVisit the ZOEÂ Health Academy to learn more about your unique biology.Learn moreOther updatesZOE Health Study joins world-leading cancer trial, NHS-GalleriJune 14, 2022Weâre very excited to announce a new partnership with the NHS-Galleri cancer trial.

That's one of the questions an international consortium of collaborators facilitated by an alliance between the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), and PATH is trying to answer as they develop a new egg-based vaccine to tackle COVID-19, inspired by influenza vaccines in longtime use.For decades, the most common influenza vaccines have been made by growing flu virus in chicken eggs and inactivating or weakening it so it can't cause disease. In fact, more than a billion safe and effective egg-based flu vaccine doses are made annually worldwide. So, could the egg-based approach be adapted to make a COVID-19 vaccine, and could existing flu vaccine factories be converted to augment the COVID-19 vaccine supply? CEPI is providing financial support of up to $2 million to PATH as the consortium aims to find out.Renowned U.S. researchers from Icahn Mount Sinai, UT Austin, and PATH are working with manufacturers in Vietnam, Thailand, and Brazil to advance the development of an egg-based COVID-19 vaccine designed to be affordable and manufacturable at scale to increase equitable access. CEPI's funding will support PATH in providing technical assistance to Instituto Butantan in Brazil, the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) in Thailand, and the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals (IVAC) in Vietnam â all established flu vaccine manufacturers â who will be suppliers of the vaccine if successful.Expanding access to COVID-19 vaccinesWhile huge progress has been made to develop multiple safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, demand continues to vastly outstrip supply so access to scarce vaccines remains grossly unequal. Adding an egg-based COVID-19 vaccine to the global vaccine arsenal could help improve access in several ways:Affordability and deliverability. With relatively low production costs and stability at regular refrigerator temperatures (2Â°C to 8Â°C) for months, this egg-based vaccine could be a practical platform for reaching resource-limited communities.Untapped production capacity. Many manufacturers already have the infrastructure to make egg-based vaccines, including in low- and middle-income parts of the world. These facilities could be converted to make large volumes of COVID-19 vaccines during idle periods half the year when they aren't making seasonal flu vaccines, or even more often if necessary. Capacity in Vietnam, Thailand, and Brazil combined could yield hundreds of millions of doses per year.Greater supply control for countries. As an option that countries could produce themselves or export regionally, an egg-based COVID-19 vaccine could both address the pandemic and provide a reliable backbone for routine immunization. It would give more countries access without having to wait in line behind much wealthier nationsâa problem that COVID-19 brought to light. Having homegrown vaccines would reduce dependency on expensive and scarce imported vaccines. Classic technology meets cutting-edge scienceEarly clinical trials are already underway in Vietnam, Thailand, and Brazil to evaluate the new egg-based COVID-19 vaccine and the results will inform future development strategies.The vaccine is based on a novel platform that brings together traditional egg-based technology with new, cutting-edge scienceâand uses another virus as a building block. Mount Sinai scientists genetically modify a Newcastle disease virus (NDV)âusually used in its live form, in vaccines for poultryâso that its surface presents the SARS-CoV-2 stabilized spike protein (known as HexaPro), developed by UT Austin. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for causing COVID-19. The spike protein is what trains the immune system to recognize and fight COVID-19 infection. The NDV is grown in eggs, purified, inactivated (or killed), and formulated into an injectable vaccine. An international collaborationThis one-of-a-kind vaccine candidate would not be possible without international collaboration.The clinical studies and overall development of the vaccine are being driven by the country manufacturers IVAC, GPO, and Instituto Butantan. Icahn Mount Sinai, UT Austin, and PATH are helping the manufacturers accelerate access to the NDV vaccine and HexaPro technologies. The recombinant NDV technology was developed by Drs. Peter Palese, Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, and Florian Krammer at Icahn Mount Sinai. And, a team at UT Austin led by Drs. Jason McLellan, Ilya Finkelstein, and Jennifer Maynard developed the stabilized spike proteinâan earlier version of which forms the basis of several other widely used COVID-19 vaccines. Icahn Mount Sinai provided the starting materials (including the GMP master seed virus), which the manufacturers can readily inject into eggs and scale-up production quickly to potentially provide large quantities of vaccines at low-cost.Overall, CEPI is supporting PATH's role as connector, facilitator, and technical advisorâlinking the technologies and partners and contributing clinical, regulatory, and quality standards expertise in an advisory role across the consortium.Some of the content in this blog is adapted from an original post on the PATH website.Q+A: How CEPI-funded research is supporting the COVID-19 vaccine rolloutRead moreReflections on 2021 from CEPI CEO Dr Richard HatchettRead moreFurther vaccine R&D is critical to end the devastating COVID-19 pandemicRead moreCEPIAboutWhat we doPartner with usNews & storiesLegalSocialAboutOur approachCEPI 2.0 and the 100 Days MissionEquitable accessThe CEPI teamBoard members & committeesInvestorsJoint Coordination GroupScientific Advisory CommitteePortfolio Strategy & Management BoardWhy we existDocuments libraryCareersWhat we doResearch & developmentEnabling scienceVaccine technologyManufacturing and supply chainPriority pathogensChikungunyaCoronavirusesDisease XEbolaLassaNipahRift Valley FeverOur portfolioOur impactPartner with usSupport CEPICalls for proposalsProcurement tendersOur coalitionNews & storiesNewsStoriesHow climate change increases pandemic riskThe Viral Most WantedMedia resourcesGlobal Pandemic Preparedness Summit 2024LegalCookie PolicyData Protection and Privacy PolicyExternal Privacy NoticeModern Slavery, Human Trafficking and Human Rights StatementReporting concernTackling RacismSocialXFacebookLinkedinÂ©2024 CEPI.

Influenza infection is a dynamic process involving complex biological host responses. The objective of this study was to illustrate global biological processes in ileum and cecal tonsils at early time points after chickens were infected with low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H9N2 through transcriptome analysis. Total RNA isolated from ileum and cecal tonsils of non-infected and infected layers at 12-, 24- and 72-h post-infection (hpi) was used for mRNA sequencing analyses to characterize differentially expressed genes and overrepresented pathways. Statistical analysis highlighted transcriptomic signatures significantly occurring 24 and 72 hpi, but not earlier at 12 hpi. Interferon (IFN)-inducible and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression was increased, followed by continued expression of various heat-shock proteins (HSP), including HSP60, HSP70, HSP90 and HSP110. Some upregulated genes involved in innate antiviral responses included DDX60, MX1, RSAD2 and CMPK2. The ISG15 antiviral mechanism pathway was highly enriched in ileum and cecal tonsils at 24 hpi. Overall, most affected pathways were related to interferon production and the heat-shock response. Research on these candidate genes and pathways is warranted to decipher underlying mechanisms of immunity against LPAIV in chickens.

AIVs possess an error-prone RNA polymerase making them susceptible to reassortment, which occasionally results in the emergence of zoonotic viruses3,4. Low pathogenic (LP) AIVs of subtype H9N2 are widespread pathogens of poultry. They are listed by the World Health Organization as a zoonotic influenza virus and ranked by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as potential pandemic viruses5,6. A novel influenza A (H7N9) virus is likely to have acquired six viral segments from circulating avian H9N2 viruses7.The subtype of the virus is a critical factor in understanding the host’s ability to regulate the immune responses against AIV8,9,10,11. LPAIVs principally replicate in the avian respiratory and gastrointestinal tract (GIT), causing mild signs of illness12. Replication of LPAIVs in the GIT disrupts the gut microbiota and dysregulates type I interferons (IFN)13,14,15. The GIT plays a critical role in immune homeostasis, balancing the protection of the host against invading pathogens and interacting with commensal microbiota16,17,18. The well-developed gut-associated lymphoid tissues in the GIT are the first line of defence against invading pathogens and consist of various lymphoid cells found in Peyer’s patches, cecal tonsils and epithelial lining and lamina propria of the GIT19. Peyer’s patches are located at the anti-mesenterial side of the chicken jejunum, and one Peyer’s patch is consistently found in ileum at the proximal ileocecal transition20. Peyer’s patches epithelium has specialized cells called M cells that overlay follicles of defined T and B cell areas. Cecal tonsils are located at the cecum–rectum junction and have a structure similar to Peyer’s patches20,21. Antigen recognition through M cells or by direct antigen sampling by macrophages and dendritic cells induce intestinal immune responses22,23.There has been significant interest in understanding how influenza viruses interact with their host. To this end, several studies have interrogated transcriptomics of host responses to LPAIV and highly pathogenic AIV24,25,26. These studies have revealed a complex network of immune responses initiated by avian influenza viruses, at cellular and tissue levels, in the respiratory tract24,27,28,29,30, ileum8,31, dendritic cells25 and chicken embryonic fibroblasts32. It has become evident that avian influenza viruses trigger the innate receptors of their host. Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) are the host's innate immune sensors, and at least three distinct classes of PRRs recognize influenza virus infection33,34. This recognition leads to secretion of cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides by cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages. Additional immune responses occur at immunological induction sites, including activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG)35,36. Remarkably, viral mechanisms antagonizing Toll-like receptor-mediated signaling by influenza viruses have not been described37. However, the influenza virus non-structural 1 (NS1) protein limits type I IFN responses. Deletions in influenza virus NS1 provoke augmented caspase‐1 activity post-infection of macrophages resulting in enhanced secretion of interleukin (IL)‐1β and IL-18, which indicates an antagonizing function of NS137. Viral NS1 also targets melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and directly interferes with the function of different ISGs37,38.The increasing appreciation of the complexity of GIT immune responses has increased research efforts to decipher the mechanisms behind their induction and regulation. However, there is still a paucity of information about underlying mechanisms of chicken immunity against pathogens, including AIV in the GIT. The largest lymphoid aggregates of avian gut-associated lymphoid tissue are cecal tonsils. Along with Peyer's patches in the intestine, cecal tonsils elicit protective immune responses against bacterial and viral pathogens in avian species. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine gene expression in ileum and cecal tonsils, as potential sites for virus replication and induction of immune responses. Our findings could facilitate the development of effective measures to enhance immunity against AIV in poultry.ResultsRNA-seq data analysisThe average number of reads that passed the quality control was 23.7 and 25.5 million reads per sample for cecal tonsils and ileum, respectively. The average percentage of reads uniquely mapped to the chicken reference genome was 89.7% and 91.7% of the reads for cecal tonsils and ileum, respectively.Global profiles of DE genes in chicken infected with low pathogenic AIV subtype H9N2Transcriptomic changes were detectable in cecal tonsils and peaked at 24 hpiComparing the gene expression in cecal tonsil tissues between infected and non-infected groups, the highest number of DE genes was 24 hpi and reduced to near baseline at 72 hpi (Table 1; Fig. 1A). The significant changes were also illustrated for DE genes with volcano plots (Fig. 2).Table 1 Significant gene expression changes following influenza infection.Full size tableFigure 1The number of significantly differentially expressed genes in the cecal tonsils and the ileum. Significantly differentially expressed genes in the cecal tonsils (panel A) and the ileum (panel B) following influenza virus infection (significant p-value of False Discovery Rate (FDR) controlled at 5%) over time. Blue bars indicate the number of upregulated genes, and the red bars indicate the number of downregulated genes.Full size imageFigure 2Volcano plots showing changes in gene expression. Volcano plots showing changes in the expression of individual genes over time (12, 24, and 72 h post-infection) in the cecal tonsils and the ileum. The number of genes decreased linearly as the fold change increased. Genes with p-values of False Discovery Rate at < 5% and fold change of > 1.5 or < -− 1.5 are depicted in red.Full size imageAt 12 hpi (Fig. 1A), there were no DE genes between AIV-infected and non-infected chickens’ cecal tonsil tissues (FDR < 5%). However, using FC-based significance (FC < 1.5), we found a downregulated gene (FGF19), which is involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1/MAPK3 signaling and cytokine signaling in immune system pathways.Changes in DE genes began in cecal tonsils at 24 hpi (Fig. 1A). Ninety-five genes had a significant fold-change in expression (84 upregulated, 11 downregulated) (Table 1). The fold-change of gene expression between infected and non-infected groups ranged from 7.27 to -3.41. The gene with the highest upregulation was a novel gene called T-complex protein 1 subunit gamma-like. This gene is an orthologue of turkey’s CCT3 (Chaperonin Containing T-complex protein 1 subunit 3) gene and encodes for a chaperonin member containing TCP1 complex. T-complex protein 1 (TCP1) is a chaperonin class of protein involved in intracellular assembly and folding of various proteins. Specifically, this protein’s gamma subunit plays a crucial role in folding and assembling cytoskeleton proteins, exploited by viruses during early viral infection. TCP1 is also a cytosolic HSP60 family protein. Another gene with significant upregulation was the early endosome antigen 1-like, a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). We also found upregulation of HSPs (HSP90AA1, HSPH1, HSPA8) and some genes involved in innate immune and antiviral responses, including IFN-inducible genes and ISGs (DDX60, IFI6, RSAD2, IFIT5, MX1, OASL, CMPK2, RNF213, ERAP1, IFIH1, STAT1, DHX58, IFITM5 (interferon-induced transmembrane) and C1S (complement C1s)). The MX1 gene prevents the import of nuclear material into viral nucleocapsids, which is known to have a disruptive effect on influenza A viruses by disrupting lipid rafts of the virus. CMPK2 is involved in the differentiation of monocytes and is involved in metabolism. The ERAP1 gene is involved in class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mediated antigen processing and presentation. The DNAJA1 gene is an important paralog of DNAJA4, and response to heat and protein folding are some of its related annotations (GO:0,009,408, GO:0,006,457). C1S was an upregulated gene in the present study and is involved in the innate immune system and regulation of complement cascade pathways. A novel chicken gene characterized as an orthologue to human USP18, was upregulated. This novel chicken gene is involved in interferon signaling, antiviral mechanisms by IFN-stimulated genes and ISG15. Another novel chicken gene, described as guanylate binding protein 1, was also upregulated and among its GO term was cellular response to interferon-gamma. Downregulated genes in cecal tonsils at 24 hpi included a novel gene (an orthologue of human SAA gene). This gene is expressed in granulocytes and involved in the biological process of acute-phase responses (GO:0,006,953, acute inflammatory response to infection) and the innate immune system pathway (R-GGA-168249).At 72 hpi, only HSPA5 had a significant upregulated expression (FDR < 5%) (Fig. 1A; Table 1). The FDR threshold was set to 10% to examine genes under a relaxed level of significance. Five HSPs were significantly different at this level. Additionally, one of these upregulated genes was CIDEC (with the greatest FC > 1.5). CIDEC (cell death-inducing DFFA (DNA fragmentation factor-alpha)-like effector c) is involved in regulating the apoptotic process. The DOP1B gene was among the results for both FC > 1.5 and FDR < 10% and is known to increase during responses to infections.Transcriptomic changes were detected in the ileal tissue at 12 hpi and peak at 24 hpiDifferential gene expression in ileal tissue samples of infected chickens was detected as early as 12 hpi, and further increased at 24 hpi and then decreased 72 hpi (Fig. 1B; Table 1). This changing dynamic and the number of significant changes were somewhat different from the cecal tonsil samples; the number of DE genes at 72 hpi was maintained above ileum baseline. The differences in DE genes and changing dynamics for each time point post-infection were further illustrated in volcano plots, which give a more detailed display of the magnitude of changes in contrast to the measure of statistical significance (Fig. 2).In ileum at 12 hpi, only three genes were significantly upregulated (FC > 1.5). RNF213 is related to class I MHC-mediated antigen processing and presentation pathways and adaptive immune system pathways. TRANK1 is a protein-coding gene, and its GO annotations for molecular functions include protein binding and ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) binding. RNF213 and TRANK1 have orthologues in humans. NCKAP5 is involved in the formation and modification of the microtubules.At 24 hpi, the number of gene expression changes in ileum increased substantially (Fig. 1B). Ninety genes had significant fold-changes (76 genes upregulated, and 14 genes downregulated) (FDR < 5% and FC > 1.5; Table 1). The fold-change of gene expression between infected and non-infected groups ranged from 2.38 to − 1.41. The gene with the greatest significant upregulation was the early endosome antigen 1-like, a novel lncRNA. The significant upregulation of RNF213 and TRANK1 continued from 12- to 24-hpi time point. There was also augmented expression of antiviral factors, including innate immune responses, IFN-inducible genes and ISGs (IFIT5, IFI6, IFIH1 (MDA5), IFITM5, IFI27L2, STAT1, MX1, DHX58, DDX60, and OASL). The RSAD2 gene was also one of the top upregulated genes. GO terms for RSAD2 were related to (1) defence responses to viruses, (2) CD4+ αβT cell activation and differentiation, (3) negative regulation of protein secretion and viral genome replication and (4) positive regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/9 signaling pathways and T-helper 2 cell cytokine production. The ZBTB32 gene was also among the significantly upregulated genes; its GO terms were related to negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The ZBTB32 orthologue in humans is ZBTB16, which is involved in the adaptive immune system and class I MHC-mediated antigen processing and presentation pathways. Heat-shock protein genes were also among the top results of upregulated genes, including HSPH1, HSPA2, HSP90AA1, HSPB9, HSPA4L and HSPA8. The C1R gene was also upregulated. It is involved in complement activation and the classical antibody-mediated complement activation pathway. TLR3 was upregulated in this study. This gene encodes TLR 3, which recognizes double-stranded RNA and plays a vital role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity.Among the significantly downregulated genes in ileum at 24 hpi were GNLY, CD3D, CST7, PTPN7, WAS and XCL1. GNLY, CD3D and CST7 are involved in the innate immune system. The PTPN7 annotation was cytokine signaling in the immune system, and WAS is involved in the Fc-gamma receptor-dependent phagocytosis pathway. XCL1 is involved in chemokine-mediated signaling pathways, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, and cellular responses to IFN-gamma, IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor.Of the 37 DE genes in ileum of infected chickens at 72 hpi, 25 genes had significant fold-changes (Table 1). HSPs were in the top results (HSPH1 (HSP110), HSP90AA1 (HSP90), HSPA4L, HSPA5 and HSPA8 (HSP70)). Additionally, PDK4, CHAC1, DNAJA4 and DNAJA1 were upregulated. In mice with severe influenza, inhibition of PDK4 using a therapeutic agent results in prevention of multiorgan failure39. CHAC1 gene annotations included the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, which usually results from the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (GO:0,070,059), and negative regulation of the Notch signaling pathway (GO:0,045,746). Like cecal tonsils results, DNAJA4 and its paralog DNAJA1 gene were also upregulated in ileum at 72 hpi. The DNAJA4 gene has related annotations, including unfolded protein binding and HSP binding (GO:0,051,082, GO:0,031,072). TGIF1 gene was upregulated and involved in signaling by the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptor complex pathway.The genes that were most downregulated in ileum at 72 hpi included P2RY4, which is involved in the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. ELF3 was also downregulated, and one of its gene ontogeny biological processes terms was inflammatory response to infection (GO:0,006,954). ELF1 is a protein encoded by the ELF1 gene, which is a paralog of ELF3 gene and regulates broad antiviral responses distinct from the type I IFN response40.Functional annotation analysisFunctional analysis of Reactome pathways of DE genesFunctional annotation analysis of Reactome pathways using the PANTHER overrepresentation test among significantly upregulated genes resulted in three statistically significant (FDR < 5%, Fisher’s exact test) Reactome pathways in cecal tonsils and ileum at 24 hpi. In both tissues, the highest enriched pathway was the ISG15 antiviral mechanism (Table 2).Table 2 Functional annotation analysis of Reactome pathways using PANTHER.Full size tableFunctional analysis of gene ontology of DE genesFunctional annotation analysis of GO using the PANTHER overrepresentation test among upregulated genes gave results in cecal tonsils at 24 hpi and ileum at 24 and 72 hpi. In cecal tonsils at 24 hpi, the significantly upregulated genes were classified into 27 biological processes and 27 molecular functions with FDR of < 5% (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8) according to the GO project, respectively. The top 10 results of enriched biological processes are shown in Fig. 3A. The main GO categories of biological processes for the upregulated genes were protein ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate)-ribosylation, positive regulation of PRR signaling pathways, positive regulation of cytokine production (e.g. positive regulation of type I IFN production) and regulation of viral life cycle (e.g. negative regulation). The top 10 results of enriched molecular functions are shown in Fig. 3B. The GO terms of the molecular functions for the upregulated genes included protein folding chaperone, single-stranded RNA binding and HSP binding.Figure 3Dot plots of functional annotation analysis of gene ontology (GO) using PANTHER.

(A) Biological Process. (B) Molecular function. (C) Cellular Components.Full size imageIn ileum at 24 hpi, the upregulated genes were classified into 30, 21 and one functional groups (FDR < 5%) of biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components, respectively (Supplementary Tables 9, 10 and 11). The top 10 results of enriched biological processes are shown in Fig. 3A. The main GO categories of the biological processes were regulation of PRR signaling pathways, positive regulation of cytokine production (e.g. IFN-β), negative regulation of viral process (e.g. negative regulation of viral genome replication) and response to stress (e.g. defense response to virus). The top 10 results of enriched molecular functions are shown in Fig. 3B. The GO terms of the molecular functions included protein folding chaperone, double- and single-stranded RNA binding, chaperone binding and unfolded protein binding. Figure 3C shows the cellular component (cytosol) as the only enriched GO term relevant to ileum at 24 hpi.In ileum at 72 hpi, the DE upregulated genes were classified into 19 biological processes, 19 molecular functions and one cellular component at FDR < 5% (Supplementary Tables 12, 13 and 14) according to the GO project, respectively. The top 10 results of enriched biological processes are shown in Fig. 3A. The main biological processes were negative regulation of inclusion body assembly, negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to stress and protein refolding. Figure 3B presents the top 10 enriched molecular functions, including C3HC4-type RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger domain binding, protein folding chaperone, misfolded protein binding, chaperone binding and HSP binding. The cellular component (cytosol) was the only enriched GO term in ileum at 72 hpi (Fig. 3C).DiscussionImmunity against AIV is the result of an orchestrated effort between innate and adaptive immune responses to this virus. Transcriptomic studies have been carried out in the GIT of chickens during infection with various subtypes of influenza A viruses. Infection with H5N1 or H5N2 in chickens results in differential expression of genes associated with innate immune responses in ileum8. Also, transcriptome analysis of ileum from birds infected with high (H5N1) and low (H5N2) pathogenic influenza viruses has revealed very different IFITM responses in ducks and chickens31. Yet, there is no comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of immune response to LPAIV, such as H9N2, in the GIT. The present study was designed to evaluate the global gene expression changes in cecal tonsils and ileum of chickens after infection with H9N2 AIV. The induced expression patterns of different genes in ileum and cecal tonsils of AIV-infected chickens were revealed with some important observations.Comparing the gene expression profiles of cecal tonsils and ileum, we observed some shared and unique responses to AIV infection. At 24 and 72 hpi, the comparison of differentially expressed genes showed that there were no genes displaying an opposite expression pattern between the two tissues and between the time points post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 2A-D). None of the sets resulted in any pathway with FDR < = 5%, except the upregulated genes in ileum at 24 hpi. The most enriched pathways were the regulation of gene expression by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway (R-GGA-1234158) and the TRAF6-mediated interferon regulatory factor (IRF7) activation pathway (R-GGA-933541). The mechanism of viral activation of the HIF-1 pathway is that influenza A virus infection causes impaired proteasome function, resulting in HIF-1α accumulation, and decreases expression of factor inhibiting HIF-1, further boosting HIF-1 activity41. Nuclear translocation of HIF-1α induced by influenza A infection is crucial to pro-inflammatory cytokines production, and deficiency of HIF-1α in lung epithelial cells enhances autophagy, facilitating influenza A virus replication42,43. Activation of IRF7 is triggered by TLR7 recognition of RNA released from the influenza virus, which is followed by the production of type I IFNs. Moreover, TRAF6-mediated IRF7 activation establishes innate immune responses and the absence of TRAF6 ensues enhanced viral replication and a significant reduction in IL-6 and type I IFNs production after infection with RNA virus44.In the present study, RNF213 was upregulated gene in ileum at 12 and 24 hpi and cecal tonsils at 24 hpi. The Rnf213 gene was identified as highly expressed among a cluster of ISGs with known antiviral activity in a mouse model45. The model revealed that the heterogeneity of influenza replication from cell to cell is not derived by cell type. Also, the cells with no or low viral replication have high induction of the Rnf213 gene45. Additionally, a low abundance of virus transcripts is associated with the host innate response (response to type I IFN) gene cluster, including the RNF213 gene, which is significantly highly expressed in response to influenza infection46. Further, a transcriptomic analysis has revealed new genes and networks in response to H5N1 infection in ducks; among them, the RNF213 gene is expressed differentially in the brain post-infection47.Here, we report that a novel gene called early endosome antigen 1-like and identified as a lncRNA had significant upregulation in cecal tonsils and ileum at 24 hpi. Although little is known about lncRNAs, a lncRNA is upregulated due to viral delivery and is required to induce antiviral effects by promoting an increase in IFN production48. Furthermore, an evolutionarily conserved role for lncRNAs has been suggested, as conserved sequences are found to define virus-specific effector and memory CD8+ T cells49. Early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), a protein-coding gene, is involved in vesicular trafficking and is affected by bacterial infections50,51. Intracellular pathogens target molecular factors, including EEA1, and inhibit its recruitment, triggering phagosomal maturation arrest50,52. Influenza A viruses benefit from EEA1 to infect human cells; following internalization of virus particles in dendritic cells, the influenza virus traffic through EEA1+ early endosomes to gain access to the cytoplasm53. Chicken EEA1 is a coding orthologue of human EEA1. It is hypothesized that lncRNA is involved in competing for endogenous RNA (ceRNA), which could regulate a protein-coding gene by sponging up microRNA54. The infected cells may increase early endosome antigen 1-like expression to limit viral entry to cells in the current study.DExD/H-box helicases, such as DDX3, have been involved as sensors in innate antiviral immunity55,56,57,58. DDX60 is involved in RIG-I-dependent and independent antiviral responses59. Several DEAD/DEAH-box RNA helicases are hijacked by RNA viruses in infected cells to facilitate their replication60,61,62,63,64. Chicken DDX60 and DHX58 have orthologues in humans. In the present study, two IFN-inducible cytoplasmic helicases were upregulated in chicken GIT post-infection: DDX60 (DExD/H-box helicase 60) and DHX58 (DExH-box helicase 58, also known as LGP2 (laboratory of genetics and physiology 2)). Our observations supported the role of DExD/H-box helicases in innate antiviral immunity and their manipulation by viruses. DDX60 upregulation started at 12 hpi in ileum but not in cecal tonsils, which then reached significant upregulation at 24 hpi in both tissues, and then subsided at 72 hpi. This gene expression may imply a broader function of chicken DExD/H-box helicases and provide a deeper understanding of immune mechanisms and pathogenesis of AIV in chicken GIT.Heat shock proteins shared across Archea, bacteria and eukaryotes, are associated with cellular injury. Expression of HSPs is elevated to protect cells under stress and is involved in protein folding, the immune system and antiviral response. However, viruses lack HSPs and depend on host HSPs for their protein folding65. Therefore, viruses can hijack HSPs, including hsp40, hsp70 and hsp90, to increase viral replication66. Exogenous administration of HSPs can enhance immune responses in cancer and infectious diseases by activation of protective T cell responses67,68. HSPs can also interact with various viral proteins; for example, HSPA8 can interact with influenza virus protein M1. This interaction inhibits the nuclear export of matrix protein 1 and nucleoprotein and subsequently inhibits viral assembly69. Upregulation of HSPs has been reported in the chicken respiratory tract27. In the present study, we found that HSPs were upregulated significantly at 24 and 72 hpi in ileum and cecal tonsils of AIV-infected chickens. Targeting HSPs could provide a platform for prophylactic or therapeutic strategies to manipulate immune responses against AIV in poultry.Viruses also exploit cytoskeleton proteins during early viral replication70,71. TCP1 is a chaperonin and a cytosolic HSP60 family protein72. The gamma subunit of TCP1 plays a vital role in the folding and assembling of cytoskeleton proteins73,74. Chicken TCP1 has a human orthologue—section of the gene that codes for the gamma-like subunit. T-complex protein 1 subunit gamma-like, a novel gene in the chicken genome, is a paralogue of chicken TCP1. In the present study, we found the most upregulation of the T-complex protein 1 subunit gamma-like gene in cecal tonsils at 24 hpi. This unique gene upregulation in cecal tonsils may signal this gene's employment by H9N2 AIV in the current study for its purposes in protein folding and assembly.We found that MX1 gene was upregulated in ileum and cecal tonsils. This may draw a link to an anti-viral response in chicken cecal tonsils to AIV infection. MX1 protein inhibits the import of nuclear material into viral nucleocapsids, which is known to have a disruptive effect on influenza A viruses by disrupting lipid rafts of the virus. Other transcriptomic studies in poultry have also shown upregulation of this gene in repertory tract and ileum8,24,27.IFITM is a family of genes known to have a role in limiting influenza infection75. Transcriptomic analysis shows that chickens mount a weak IFITM response in ileum post-infection with LPAIV H5N231. However, the findings of our study showed upregulation of IFITM5 in cecal tonsils and ileum at 24 hpi. This discrepancy of IFITM response may be because of the different subtypes used.The results of the functional analyses of the DE genes were related to the immune responses to influenza infection. GO terms and Reactome pathways results were almost exclusively associated with response to viral infection. In cecal tonsils and ileum at 24 hpi, one of the highest enriched pathways was the ISG15 antiviral mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 1). IFN-induced ISG15 targets the non-structural 1 (NS1A) protein of the influenza A virus, causing a loss of function of the NS1A protein and the inhibition of influenza A virus replication in virus-infected cells76. Additionally, ISG15 plays various roles in the defence against viral infections and the activation of immune system cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes, and natural killer cells77. Interestingly, the NS1A protein of influenza A viruses is responsible for inhibiting host immune responses by limiting production of IFNs and, therefore, antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins78.In conclusion, our study illustrated the differential expression of several innate immune system genes following AIV infection in ileum and cecal tonsils. The results of the present study revealed that there is some degree of similarity between immune responses in GIT and those induced in the respiratory tract, although further research is required to determine whether there are spatial and temporal differences in gene expression between the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Our study highlighted some of the DE genes that are known to be exploited by the influenza virus to support viral replication. Some of the DE genes have been consistently identified in chicken LPAIV studies, hinting that they may be the best candidates for future research. One important finding was the enriched antiviral pathway of ISG15. ISG15 plays a critical role in innate responses, and future research studying this mechanism might provide a platform for strategies against AIV in poultry.Materials and methodsExperimental designThis study included two main factors: treatment (challenged versus nonchallenged) and time (three time points post-infection), resulting in six groups. Each group contained six biological replicates. A total of 36 one-day-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn layers were purchased from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (Ottawa, Canada) and housed in the isolation facility at the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph. All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Guelph Animal Care Committee and conducted according to specifications of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Experiments in the manuscript followed the recommendations in the ARRIVE guidelines.Twenty-one days after hatching, 18 chickens in the challenged group were inoculated via oculo-nasal and oral routes with 250 μL of 3.1 × 107 TCID50/mL of LPAIV H9N2. Eighteen chickens in the nonchallenged group were inoculated via the same route with 200 μL of phosphate-buffered saline. The ileal samples at proximal ileocecal transition and cecal tonsils were collected from six chickens per time point at 12, 24, and 72 h post-infection (hpi) per treatment. The collected samples were transferred into tubes containing 1 mL of RNAlater solution (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, CAN) for RNA stabilization and storage for later processing. The above time points were chosen that coincides with induction of innate responses to the virus.Virus strain and virus propagationA/TK/IT/13VIR1864-45/2013 (H9N2) from the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe), Italy, was used in this study. The virus was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated specific pathogen-free chicken eggs. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C, eggs were refrigerated at 4 °C overnight. Allantoic fluid was collected and purified by centrifuging at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then stored at -80 °C until further use. The propagated virus titer was determined with 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells.Extraction, library preparation and RNA sequencingTotal RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Toronto, ON, CAN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Library construction, quality control testing and sequencing were performed by Novogene (Sacramento, USA). Briefly, quantification and quality control testing were performed on 1% agarose gels, the NanoPhotometer spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA) and the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit in a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). A total amount of 1 μg of RNA per sample was used for library preparation using a NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, USA). Library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using a PE Cluster Kit cBot-HS (Illumina). cDNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq-4000 platform, and 150 base pair paired-end reads were generated.RNAseq data analysis interpretationRNA-seq analysis was performed on the Trimmomatic-STAR-RSEM-DESeq2 pipeline previously established79. Raw reads were processed for quality control. Clean data were obtained based on Phred score (a quality measure to assess the accuracy of a sequencing) by trimming adapters and nucleotides with a Phred score of less than 30 at the beginning and end of the reads and discarding nucleotides with a Phred score of less than 20 in the window of five nucleotides using Trimmomatic80. The minimum length of surviving reads was set at 36 nucleotides. All downstream analyses were based on clean data with high quality.Reads were mapped to a Gallus gallus reference genome (GRCg6a, release 98) using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) (version 2.7.0a)81. The number of reads per gene was quantified by RNA-Seq by Expectation–Maximization (RSEM)82. RSEM output files were used in DESeq2 (version 1.24.0) to calculate differentially expressed (DE) genes by comparing challenge group versus control group for each tissue per time point83. Genes with an absolute fold-change (FC) of more than a 1.5 (|FC|> 1.5; |log2FC|> 0.584) and with a significant p-value when False Discovery Rate (FDR) was controlled at 5% were considered DE. VennDiagram package in R was used to compare DE genes between cecal tonsils and ileum at 24 and 72 h time points84.Functional annotation analysis of DE genesOverrepresentation analysis was performed on PANTHER (version 15) (http://www.pantherdb.org/) using the PANTHER Overrepresentation Test (Released 20,200,728) on DE genes of each tissue at each time point. Gene ontology (GO) database https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3954044 Released 2020–07-16 (http://www.geneontology.org) was used to analyze the overrepresentation of GO terms in all gene lists. Reactome pathways (from Reactome database version 65, Released 2019–12-22) was used to analyze the overrepresentation of pathways among genes in all gene lists (https:/eactome.org/). Both tests were performed using Fisher's exact test with FDR correction.

Now, drug companies are racing to apply the technology platform for influenza.

Download PDF Download PDF Credit: PhotoDisc/GettyImagesHot off the successful deployment of mRNA vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19, three leading drugmakers have moved seasonal flu vaccine candidates built with the technology into early clinical testing. More companies intend to follow their leads next year (Table 1).These candidates, if successful, could dramatically bolster the efficacy of a vaccine class that often delivers lacklustre protection. For mRNA’s proponents — led by Moderna, Pfizer and Sanofi, all of which initiated phase I trials in recent months — new flu jabs could prove lucrative or help maintain standing in a global market projected to exceed US$10 billion by decade’s end.Table 1 | Select mRNA vaccines for seasonal influenza in and approaching the clinicSponsorProduct nameTechnologyTypeFlu antigen(s)In the clinicModernamRNA-1010mRNAQuadrivalentHaemagglutininSanofi/Translate BioMRT-5400, MRT-5401mRNA aMonovalent (H3N2)HaemagglutininPfizerPF-07252220mRNAMonovalent (H1N1) and monovalent (B/Yamagata), to be combined into bivalent and quadrivalentHaemagglutininPreclinicalModernamRNA-1020, mRNA-1030mRNAMultivalentHaemagglutinin + neuraminidaseModernamRNA-1073mRNAQuadrivalent + COVID-19HaemagglutininInnornamRNAQuadrivalent and pentavalent (two H3N2 strains)HaemagglutininSanofimRNAQuadrivalentHaemagglutininNIAIDmRNAMonovalent (H1N1)HaemagglutininNIAIDmRNAUniversalHaemagglutinin stemSeqirussaRNAQuadrivalentHaemagglutininPfizersaRNAUndisclosed valencyHaemagglutininArcturusUndecidedQuadrivalentHaemagglutininGSK/CureVacUndecidedUndisclosed valencyUndisclosedaMRT-5400 and MRT-5401 rely on non-modified RNA. NIAID, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; saRNA, self-amplifying RNA.But flu shots could also prove a more challenging test for mRNA than did COVID-19. That’s because unlike with SARS-CoV-2 — for which there were no established medical interventions — nine flu jabs from four different vaccine manufacturers are already available in the United States alone.Those vaccines are safe, but their efficacy leaves room for improvement. Existing flu shots, whether built around inactivated viruses or recombinant proteins, typically offer only 40–60% protection from infection. In theory, mRNA might make for a better product: elicited immune responses may be broader, expressed proteins should have better sequence fidelity, strain selection may be more accurate and the technology makes it easy to incorporate large numbers of antigens. All of these features could translate into greater immune protection.But mRNA, at least when formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), is prone to tolerability issues. Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech’s authorized mRNA jabs for COVID-19 often cause sore arms, headaches, low-grade fevers and fatigue. These same symptoms can occur with approved flu shots, but typically are much milder in degree.mRNA “is a tool that does offer some upside potential,” says Gary Nabel, former CSO of Sanofi, the founding director of the NIH’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC), and CEO of the stealth-stage immunotherapeutics company ModeX Therapeutics. “The big stumbling block is safety.”To impact the established market, the platform would need to find a more tolerogenic sweet spot, as well as offer major efficacy advantages.And yet, it’s no sure thing that mRNA will prove capable of effectively delivering haemagglutinin glycoproteins, the main antigen found in flu vaccines. “Did we just get really incredibly lucky with COVID vaccines because of the antigen design and the immunodominancy of that protein?” asks Anna Blakney, an RNA bioengineer at the University of British Columbia. “Or have we stumbled on something that’s functional for other viral glycoproteins as well?”Making itMany of the leading mRNA-based flu contenders were working on flu vaccine candidates before the pandemic. Then came the novel coronavirus, and “we literally swapped out flu coding sequences and swapped in SARS-CoV-2 sequences,” says Philip Dormitzer, head of viral vaccines research at Pfizer.The whole field has benefited. Seqirus stayed out of the COVID-19 vaccine race, despite having a self-amplifying mRNA platform that delivers both the antigen-coding sequence and the replication machinery needed for the construct to copy itself inside the host cell. (Seqirus acquired that platform from Novartis in 2015.) “Seeing an mRNA vaccine functional and generating such a robust response has somewhat derisked the outside concerns that people may have had around the general technology,” says Ethan Settembre, vice president of R&D at Seqirus.And the potential benefits of mRNA for flu prophylaxis are many.Some of these boil down to how the vaccines get made. Because mRNA vaccines are manufactured synthetically, by encoding a target antigen sequence into a plasmid template, they offer high fidelity: encoded antigens exactly match the flu strains selected for each year’s vaccine. By contrast, inactivated virus vaccines that are made in egg- and cell-based systems often suffer from sequence mutations that weaken their effectiveness.Recombinant protein vaccines offer that same fidelity advantage, but the manufacturing process for these is comparatively cumbersome. The flexibility and speed of mRNA vaccine production mean that vaccine makers could wait longer to begin manufacturing — starting production in May, say, instead of February, for the northern hemisphere. This would enable them to make more informed decisions about what strains to include.“Every bit of time helps,” says Sally Mossman, head of GlaxoSmithKline's Vaccine R&D centre in the United States.Enter the multiplexThere may be other efficacy benefits. The US relies on quadrivalent vaccines, containing haemagglutinin antigens (either purified from inactivated viruses or manufactured recombinantly) or live attenuated viruses that confer protection against four strains of influenza. (Other jurisdictions still use trivalent vaccines.) Some researchers have argued in favour of adding protection against additional strains, but doing so is logistically challenging with existing platforms.Not necessarily so with mRNA.A team led by Norbert Pardi, from the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, and Raffael Nachbagauer, then at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, showed as much last year. They immunized mice against one subtype of influenza with an mRNA vaccine encoding four different proteins: haemagglutinin stalk, neuraminidase, matrix-2 ion channel and nucleoprotein. Together with Mount Sinai’s Meagan McMahon, Pardi and his colleagues have since repeated the exercise for two other flu subtypes. They plan to test a combined vaccine containing 10–12 antigens in mice and ferrets. Ideally, this will induce such broad immune protection that it doesn’t need to be taken every year.Many researchers also hope that mRNA will spur stronger or more diverse immune responses than traditional platforms. If true, this could prove especially beneficial for older adults, who often have weak responses to flu vaccines, notes Jenna Bartley, who studies immunological aging at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine.It could even aid in the development of a universal flu vaccine that protects against all strains of the virus, says Duke University’s Tony Moody. With NIH backing, he is now developing an mRNA-based haemagglutinin stabilized-stem vaccine, modelled after a protein-based one that is already in the clinic. “It’s an informative experiment,” says VRC director John Mascola. “We don’t know how to induce a high level of durable antibodies to stem, and mRNA may be different in the way that it induces that response.”Current vaccine technologies mostly elicit only humoural responses that block viral invasion. mRNA vaccines, because they somewhat mimic natural infections, may bring about better T-cell responses.Barney Graham also sees a broader societal opportunity: by working on seasonal mRNA candidates today, companies should be better prepared to tackle flu pandemics in the future. “That is the place mRNA could really change the deal,” says Graham, who retired as deputy director of the VRC at the end of August. “If we really did have a pandemic, you could design [a new vaccine] within 10 minutes after you got the sequence, and you could have mRNA going into arms within a few weeks.”Show me the dataThe only human data reported to date on an mRNA-based flu vaccine come from Moderna’s first foray into the clinic. Beginning in late 2015, the company evaluated a pair of two-dose vaccines, each designed against a different strain of avian influenza.According to former Moderna CMO Tal Zaks, the main goal of those trials was to give the company’s mRNA a test run. “If you want to show that the technology works, the easiest place to start is with an influenza vaccine,” he says. With influenza, he explains, the correlates of protection — measurements of immune parameters that allow prediction of vaccine efficacy — are well defined. There are also established vaccines to reference clinical results to.To many onlookers, Moderna’s first trials were a disappointment. Although most study participants who received higher doses of the experimental vaccines developed influenza-specific antibody titres above the threshold thought to be protective — as measured by the well-validated haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay — those antibody levels tapered off within just months of immunization. This suggests that the protection these offer might be short-lived. T-cell immunity was not detectable at all.Former company executives involved in the trials see things differently. Both Giuseppe Ciaramella, ex-head of infectious diseases research, and Michael Watson, former president of Moderna’s vaccines unit, argue that the vaccines induced a robust pool of memory B cells, which remember antigens and can trigger rapid production of antibodies when people are re-exposed to the virus.They highlight data from 5 participants who received their two shots 6 months apart, instead of 3 weeks apart like everyone else. Those individuals achieved much higher average HAI titres — “evidence,” says Watson, “that the first dose had primed really well.” Watson is now executive chairman of VaxEquity and chief executive of MEVOX, neither of which is working on influenza.Watson is less sanguine about the tolerability findings, though. Although Moderna has since changed its LNP formulation and aspects of its mRNA design, its early trial data suggested that the therapeutic index for an mRNA-based flu vaccine might be narrow. This could prove problematic for a multi-component seasonal flu shots designed to train the immune system to recognize at least four antigens.Moderna is nevertheless forging ahead clinically — and it has already begun adding additional antigens to its next generation of flu products. Neuraminidase, another surface glycoprotein, will be included in the company’s follow-on clinical candidates. Other antigens that might better stimulate T-cell immunity are under consideration as well. Plus, the company is preparing combination vaccine candidates that could protect against multiple respiratory viruses. One of these, for COVID-19 and flu, is due to enter clinical testing next year.But the addition of antigenic targets will likely necessitate higher total vaccine doses, points out Watson, potentially triggering more severe adverse reactions. “That’s definitely the yin and the yang there,” he says.Open seasonNachbagauer, who joined Moderna last year to lead infectious disease R&D efforts, is mindful of the tolerability concerns, but he is taking a wait-and-see approach to the problem. The company’s first seasonal flu vaccine candidate, mRNA-1010, consists of four mRNA sequences encoding haemagglutinin glycoproteins from the viral lineages recommended by global health authorities, formulated in the same LNPs used to deliver the company’s COVID-19 vaccine. “We’re really interested in what our reactogenicity looks like,” he says.The immunological contexts around pandemic and seasonal flu vaccines are quite different, adds Nachbagauer. Pandemic flu vaccines have to protect against a novel threat. Because people generally do not have pre-existing immunity to these, a two-dose, prime-boost immunization regimen is key. With the seasonal flu, most people have been exposed to the related strains or received earlier flu jabs. Just one shot can therefore be enough to protect against the latest adaptation of a continuously mutating adversary. If the COVID-19 vaccines are any guide, a one-dose candidate could prove more tolerable than a two-dose product.Moderna launched a 180-person, dose-ranging trial of mRNA-1010 in July. It is expected to run through early 2022.Sanofi and Pfizer have also moved their first mRNA-based flu shots into phase I testing. These companies are taking measured approaches to derisking mRNA platforms, starting with candidates containing just a single mRNA encoding the haemagglutination head domain from one type of influenza virus.Sanofi is evaluating its monovalent H3N2 vaccine candidate in two different LNP formulations. “If results are positive, clinical development of a quadrivalent flu vaccine would be the next step,” says Frank DeRosa, chief technology officer of Sanofi subsidiary Translate Bio. (Sanofi acquired Translate earlier this year for $3.2 billion.)The company’s flu vaccine, for now, uses a form of mRNA that lacks the chemical modifications found in most other mRNA products. Sanofi’s COVID-19 vaccine, built around this unmodified mRNA platform, successfully elicited antibody responses in early clinical testing. But it remains unproven in an efficacy trial. CureVac’s unmodified mRNA COVID-19 vaccine stumbled in phase III trials, however, raising the possibility that this strategy may prove inferior to modified mRNA candidates.That perhaps explains why Sanofi is planning to also have a quadrivalent flu vaccine, based on modified mRNA, in the clinic by next year. CureVac, in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline, is considering both mRNA options for its flu jab.Meanwhile, Pfizer is moving ahead with two parallel programmes: one involving modified mRNA, and the other with a self-amplifying construct. Its modified mRNA candidate, PF-07252220, is first up. (Pfizer has licensed BioNTech’s technology, and has elected to advance its flu programme solo.) In September, it began a phase I trial of this monovalent vaccine at four dose levels, each shot containing a single antigen from either a type A or B influenza strain. It plans to later combine those into a bivalent vaccine, administered at different dosages, before moving onto a quadrivalent product — all benchmarked against an approved flu shot.Pfizer plans to begin trials of its self-amplifying mRNA candidate in the coming months, too.A path well troddenFor any mRNA-based vaccine that advances into later-stage testing, the regulatory pathway to approval is well defined: companies will either need to demonstrate efficacy through classical clinical trials or show non-inferiority against a licensed comparator on a surrogate measure of protection, such as HAI titre. “That’s the beauty about flu,” says Pad Chivukula, chief scientific officer and chief operating officer of Arcturus Therapeutics. “The path for licensure is pretty straightforward.”The correlate approach is lower cost and involves less risk, especially for vaccines optimized to induce antibody production. But it won’t capture protection accrued through induction of T-cell responses or other arms of the immune system, a potential downfall for mRNA contenders. The correlate approach also won’t support claims about the superiority of the platform when it comes to the breadth or longevity of protection. So most companies with mRNA-based vaccines in the works anticipate eventually running large-scale trials over one or more flu seasons.“Ultimately,” says Dormitzer, “I think for people to really be convinced to switch to a new vaccine platform, they’re going to want to see efficacy as well as all the immunological comparisons.”Although last year saw a sharp drop in flu cases around the world, likely the result of mask-wearing and social-distancing in response to COVID-19, most experts expect influenza to come storming back. When it does, companies hope their mRNA-based vaccine candidates will be ready.

Japan's National Daily Since 1922 Japanese Contact Us Top Latest Japan World Business Sports Science Entertainment Opinion Lifestyle Obituaries Features Photos Videos Japan experts warn of double COVID, flu winter outbreak threat October 12, 2021 (Mainichi Japan) Japanese version A flu vaccine shot is being administered in Tokyo's Shinjuku Ward on Oct. 9, 2021, as seen in this image provided by Navitas Clinic Shinjuku. TOKYO -- Experts in Japan have been on the alert against the simultaneous spread of the coronavirus and seasonal influenza during this winter, which is expected to see a "sixth wave" of COVID-19 cases, in spite of last season's low levels of flu activity. A sudden rise in both COVID-19 and flu patients would strain Japan's health care system and increase the burden on the field, and this may trigger a medical collapse. While flu outbreaks were not seen last winter, contrary to general expectations, specialists have shown concern over a potential double outbreak this season. "It is necessary to make preparations, taking into account the flu outbreak in autumn and winter," read a recommendation by the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry's advisory board in a document it released on Sept. 27. The initial symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza are similar and difficult to distinguish from one another. If both flu and coronavirus patients flood medical institutions that have outpatient wards for people with fevers, it is possible that those on the ground will be overstrained and become unable to provide appropriate medical care. In normal years, flu outbreaks tend to occur during winter. Coronavirus infections also peaked between late December 2020 and early January 2021 during the "third coronavirus wave." There have been reported cases of breakthrough infections -- in which people inoculated twice for the coronavirus still contract it -- and many experts have predicted a "sixth wave" will hit the country this winter. However, it is difficult to foresee double outbreaks. Although experts cautioned against a simultaneous spread last winter as well, the number of flu cases was extremely small. In 2018 and 2019, over 250,000 weekly flu cases were reported during January and February, the time during which infections reach a peak in usual years. However, this number dropped to around 90,000 during the same period in 2020, and fell below 100 in 2021. The low circulation of the flu was observed not just in Japan, but worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) stated in a document released in June that influenza cases decreased drastically on a global level, excluding some areas, from mid- to late 2020. A flu outbreak has not yet occurred in the southern hemisphere this year. As for the reason behind the low circulation levels, the WHO raised multiple factors. Countermeasures against the coronavirus, including restrictions on movement and closures of national borders, as well as teleworking and other social distancing measures, appear to be one factor that was effective in curbing the spread of influenza. The WHO pointed out that the period when such anti-coronavirus measures were commenced is directly linked with the plunge in reported flu cases. That the coronavirus is more transmissible than influenza, and that people were equipped with immunity against the flu, due to having been infected in the past, are believed to be among the reasons behind only transmission of the influenza virus having been curbed. The WHO has also raised the possibility of a "viral interference" -- a phenomenon where an outbreak of one virus can inhibit the spread of another type of virus. There have been past cases of viral interference between outbreaks of influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses, as well as between influenza and rhinoviruses. That being said, it is not guaranteed that a flu outbreak will not occur this season. The British government has predicted that the size of the flu outbreak this winter will be 1.5 times that of regular flu season. A group from Spain warned in a JAMA article in June that herd immunity against a certain pathogen will wane if the pathogen is not circulated, and this may lead to an early-stage occurrence of a large and serious outbreak spanning a long period of time.

Who needs a flu vaccine and when?TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Oct 13, 2021, 11:00 ISTShareAA+Text SizeSmallMediumLargeFollow us 1/6Why is it beneficial to get a flu vaccine right now?The 2021 flu season is causing a surge in cases, and seeing multiple accounts of hospitalization as well. For an infection which is often taken to be a form of a routine illness, it is being considered to be a ‘worse form of a cold’ that doesn’t relieve easily. At the same time, while severe infection cases are being observed, there’s also been a lot of stress on the importance of flu vaccination, which, much like COVID-19, can protect one from severity and infection risk.Read more: All your questions about flu vaccine availability cleared2/6Is COVID-19 making flu season worse?Granted that we have been facing the upsurge of a graver virus for almost two years, there are many who believe that added preventive hygiene measures, and a waning exposure level to respiratory viruses, including influenza are contributing to a severe flu season this year. Not only are we not habitual to getting the flu, later diagnosis and prolonged symptoms are making a case of flu just as relatively serious as that of COVID-19 risk right now.Having said that, considering the rise in cases and change in season, getting the flu vaccine right now is a beneficial choice. Scientists usually develop the annual influenza vaccines based on the composition of the flu strains that circulated the year before. The vaccines also get routinely upgraded and changed, to offer higher protection odds. Hence, noting the timing, and the type of vaccine you get are factors which should be considered , if you are to get vaccinated right now.3/6Why does timing matter, when it comes to the flu vaccination?Flu virus is a pathogen which keeps on mutating often. Unlike other vaccines, the flu vaccine has been known to grant favourable immune protection for a limited time, (6-7 months). Hence, getting a version of the vaccine which offers protection against the new variants, and does not cause an immunity dip is essential to minimize chances of infection.Getting a vaccine dose, in times like this, even if you have had contracted the flu before helps limit the odds of contracting the infection, differentiate easily between COVID and flu and prevent risk of hospitalization as well. 4/6When would it be the best time to get the shot?September-October are usually the months when the flu season gets worse, many tend to consider these months to be the best time to get a flu shot.Since it's also speculated that if a third wave is to come up, there are higher chances of COVID and the flu circulating at the same time and causing infection, getting both the vaccines at the appropriate time will help individuals stay vigilant, and avoid additional risks of coinfection too. However, since flu can also routinely strike through other parts of the year, a vaccine can be taken earlier too, but it would nonetheless be most effective if taken during the peak season. Hence, if you do plan to get inoculated, wisest would be to get the flu jab by the end of October. 5/6How long does it take to build sufficient immunity?Much like the COVID-19 vaccine, the flu vaccine too takes about two weeks time post vaccination to dole out protective antibodies, which then stays on for about six months before starting to wane. 6/6Who requires prioritized care and why?While it's imperative that everyone get vaccinated at a wise time, flu, like COVID-19 can be a lurking threat for some specific age groups, including kids and seniors. Since senior age groups, with immunocompromising issues, and pre-existing health problems can be prone to serious illness and hospitalization, these people may need more prioritized care.Kids may also currently benefit from getting timely flu shots, since they do not have access to COVID shots right now. Protection against the flu will help them avoid infection, and easily differentiate between symptoms as well.

Vaccinations given via a quick, safe and painless nasal spray will be offered to all primary and secondary aged children in local schools over the coming weeks, with the first youngsters having received theirs. Free copies of this year's exciting Flu Fighters storybook, Flu Fighters On A Vacc-tastic Voyage, are being given to all primary school children a few weeks before the vaccination is due in their school. All primary and secondary pupils will also a receive parental consent form, and parents and guardians are asked to complete and return these as soon as possible. Councillor Jasbir Jaspal, the City of Wolverhampton Council’s Cabinet Member for Public Health and Wellbeing, said: "I am delighted that the annual flu vaccination programme is now underway in our city's schools, helping to protect children and their families from this particularly nasty winter virus. "Influenza can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death, and the best way to protect yourself is to have your flu vaccination each year. It will also help to protect friends and family, some of whom may be more vulnerable to flu. "The vaccine is safe and has been given to millions of children around the world, and youngsters needn't worry about any nasty needles, either, because the vaccine is delivered via a quick squirt up the nose. "Please return your completed consent forms as soon as possible to ensure your child doesn't miss out." Sally Roberts, Chief Nurse for the Black Country and West Birmingham Clinical Commissioning Group, said: "The importance of the vaccine in protecting our children from the effects of severe flu cannot be underestimated. It is also very valuable in preventing the spread of harmful germs within the community. "I would urge all parents to ensure that their children are appropriately protected by consenting for them to have the vaccine, because it is better to be safe than sorry." Primary and secondary aged children will be offered the nasal spray through their school. Vaccination via a nasal spray is also available to children aged 2 and 3, and children with some long term health conditions, through their GP.
