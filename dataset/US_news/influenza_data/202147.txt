Saving Lives, Protecting People Search Submit Influenza (Flu) CDC Tracking Flu in Young AdultsAgency Urges Vaccination and Precautions to Prevent the Spread of Flu EspaÃ±ol | Other Languages Print Minus Related Pages November 19, 2021—While overall flu activity is still low in the United States, the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza infections continue to increase. More than 90 percent of the cases have been detected in children and young adults, and CDC’s system for monitoring influenza-like-illness (ILI) shows hot spots of activity in several urban centers home to large colleges or universities. While most of the laboratory-confirmed influenza infections have been influenza A(H3N2) virus infections, laboratory data suggest ILI activity is a result of varying levels of flu and other respiratory viruses. Don’t take flu home for the holidays, get a flu vaccine to prevent the spread of flu. Healthy Habits to Help Protect Against Flu Get vaccinated against flu as soon as possible. Take everyday preventive actions to reduce the spread of respiratory illness like flu. These everyday preventive actions include staying home when sick, covering coughs and sneezes, and washing your hands often. While CDC does not recommend routine use of masks for seasonal flu in the community setting, it is recommended for prevention of COVID-19 at this time. For people who develop flu symptoms, which can overlap with those of other respiratory viruses, there are tests that can distinguish between flu and other viruses, including COVID-19, for example. It’s important to remember that there also are drugs to treat flu illness. CDC recommends prompt treatment with a flu antiviral drug for people who have flu or suspected flu and who are at higher risk of serious flu complications. Antiviral drugs are not a substitute for getting a flu vaccine. While flu vaccine can vary in how well it works, a flu vaccine is the best way to help prevent seasonal flu and its potentially serious complications. Antiviral drugs are a second line of defense that can be used to treat flu if you get sick. CDC recommends that people at higher risk of developing serious flu complications get antiviral treatment as early as possible, because benefit is greatest if treatment is started within 2 days after illness onset. As young adults with flu travel for the Thanksgiving holiday, this could set off community-wide spread across the country. This situation underscores the importance of ongoing seasonal flu and COVID-19 vaccination efforts as well as that people be proactive about taking other precautions for their own health and the health of others. Given the timing of the fast-approaching Thanksgiving holiday and the fact that it takes two weeks for immunity from vaccination to set in, people should get vaccinated as soon as possible and also take everyday preventive actions to reduce the spread of respiratory illness like flu. These everyday preventive actions include staying home when sick, covering coughs and sneezes, and washing your hands often. While CDC does not recommend routine use of masks for seasonal flu in the community setting, it is recommended for prevention of COVID-19 at this time. On college campuses, flu viruses are known to spread rapidly in close quarters like common living spaces, classrooms, shared restrooms, and through social activities. Despite this, young adults consistently have the lowest flu vaccination coverage every flu season in the United States. For example, a CDC Epi-Aid that is supporting a local investigation into an outbreak of H3N2 flu at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor has found nearly 700 students, faculty and staff have tested positive for influenza since October 6, 2021, but only about one-quarter of them had been vaccinated. CDC also has anecdotal reports of flu outbreaks at other colleges and universities across the country. Many of these coincide with urban centers and economically linked surrounding areas (technically called “core-based statistical areas”) that are showing elevated ILI. It’s important to note that ILI visits do not necessarily represent influenza virus infection. ILI visits include patients who present with a fever (temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater) and a cough and/or a sore throat. These symptoms can result from infection with a number of different viruses, including SARS-CoV-2; therefore, it’s important to look at laboratory data for flu or other respiratory viruses in combination with ILI data to get a complete picture of influenza and other respiratory virus activity. Laboratory data from public health and clinical laboratories suggest that flu is contributing to some, but not all of these hotspots of ILI. In addition to showing areas where ILI is elevated, CDC’s FluView interactive displays flu laboratory data nationally, by HHS Region, as well as by state, so that people can track where influenza viruses have been detected. Looking to the holidays and beyond, there’s still time to benefit from a flu vaccine this season. Flu activity is just beginning and while unpredictable, most often peaks between December and February and can last into May. A flu vaccine protects against four flu viruses, including an H3N2 virus that was updated for this season’s flu vaccines. Getting a flu vaccine has many benefits. In addition to helping prevent flu illness, several studies have shown flu vaccination reduces the severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick. Flu vaccination also can help protect others. Much of the U.S. population is at higher risk of developing serious flu illness, including people 65 and older, young children, people with certain chronic conditions and pregnant people. Flu can be more serious for them. While people at higher risk should get vaccinated, if the people around them get vaccinated too, that can provide a cocooning effect, where vaccinated people can help form a “cocoon” of disease protection. Initial CDC estimates of flu vaccine uptake this season suggest that flu vaccination coverage is lower compared to the same time last season among certain groups of people. For people who develop flu symptoms, which can overlap with those of other respiratory viruses, there are tests that can distinguish between flu and other viruses, including COVID-19, for example. It’s important to remember that there also are drugs to treat flu illness. CDC recommends prompt treatment with a flu antiviral drug for people who have flu or suspected flu and who are at higher risk of serious flu complications. Antiviral drugs are not a substitute for getting a flu vaccine. While flu vaccine can vary in how well it works, a flu vaccine is the best way to help prevent seasonal flu and its potentially serious complications. Antiviral drugs are a second line of defense that can be used to treat flu if you get sick. CDC recommends that people at higher risk of developing serious flu complications get antiviral treatment as early as possible, because benefit is greatest if treatment is started within 2 days after illness onset. It’s also important to remember COVID-19 vaccines will not prevent flu illness and vice versa. Flu vaccines protect against flu viruses, and COVID-19 vaccines protect against the virus that causes COVID-19. So, one vaccine is not a substitute or a replacement for the other. Both vaccines are recommended, and it’s important that people be up to date on their recommended flu and COVID-19 vaccines. For adults and most children, a single dose of flu vaccine is needed annually for everyone 6 months and older. Flu vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines can be given during the same visit.

IDV is one of the causative agents of Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD), which causes high morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle worldwide. To date, the molecular mechanisms of IDV pathogenicity are unknown. Recent IDV outbreaks in cattle, along with serological and genetic evidence of IDV infection in humans, have raised concerns regarding the zoonotic potential of this virus. Influenza virus polymerase is a determining factor of viral pathogenicity to mammals.MethodsHere we take a prospective approach to this question by creating a random mutation library about PB2 subunit of the IDV viral polymerase to test which amino acid point mutations will increase viral polymerase activity, leading to increased pathogenicity of the virus.ResultsOur work shows some exact sites that could affect polymerase activities in influenza D viruses. For example, two single-site mutations, PB2-D533S and PB2-G603Y, can independently increase polymerase activity. The PB2-D533S mutation alone can increase the polymerase activity by 9.92 times, while the PB2-G603Y mutation increments the activity by 8.22 times.ConclusionTaken together, our findings provide important insight into IDV replication fitness mediated by the PB2 protein, increasing our understanding of IDV replication and pathogenicity and facilitating future studies. IntroductionInfluenza viruses are currently the most common pathogens known to cause flu epidemics between humans and animals. Influenza viruses not only cause tremendous economic losses due to animal infection but can also directly infect humans despite the host barrier. In addition, reassortment events can occur with other flu viruses, even posing severe risks to human health. Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and comprise four species: A, B, C, and D. Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are known to cause occasional pandemics and seasonal epidemics. Aquatic birds are considered an important natural reservoir of influenza A viruses that can then infect various domestic fowls and mammals, such as horses, pigs, dogs, cats, tigers, and minks [1]. Influenza B viruses (IBVs) appear to naturally infect only humans and seals. IBV can simultaneously infect the upper and lower respiratory tracts and cause similar symptoms to type A [2]. Influenza C viruses (ICVs) cause upper respiratory tract infections among children, generally with milder symptoms [3].Influenza D viruses (IDVs) were first isolated from swine suspected of influenza in 2011, but they have been found in cattle worldwide since 2014. The main reservoirs of IDV are cattle, swine, and other small ruminants [4]. IDV is similar to ICV in regards to structure and genes. So far, IDV is mainly divided into three pedigrees: D/OK, D/660, and D/Japan, and cross-reactivity is found among those three pedigrees [5]. Reports showed that IDV is more likely to mutate and evolve than ICV; hence, a continuous monitor for IDV variation is needed [6]. Serological investigation indicates that IDV could infect humans, as screenings showed that 1.3% of general populations presented anti-IDV hemagglutination inhibitory antibodies in serum [4]. When the positive rate of anti-IDV antibodies was analyzed in people who were professionally exposed to cattle in Florida, the seroprevalence of people raising cattle was as high as 95%, and the seroprevalence of individuals who had never been exposed to cattle could be as high as 18% [7]. It is still unclear whether the IDV viruses could cause human disease and whether there is transmission among humans. IDV infections have also been reported outside the U.S., including France, Italy, Ireland, Japan, China, Morocco, Benin, Togo, and Kenya.Since the beginning of the twentieth century, four global influenza pandemics have been recorded: the so-called Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, the Asian flu pandemic of 1957, the Hong Kong flu of 1968, and the swine flu pandemic of 2009. Of these, the Spanish flu epidemic was the most severe one [8]. It is believed that the trigger for influenza pandemics is that the influenza viruses acquired a new type of hemagglutinin during the spread in the general population that lacks antibodies against this new hemagglutinin protein. Describing how the viruses adapt to new hosts will contribute to our understanding of the evolution and spreading of zoonotic infectious diseases that might eventually evolve into a human pandemic [9].The influenza viruses polymerase is a key decision factor in hosting a range of viruses. The polymerase performs the transcription and replication of the virus genome. Mutations in polymerase could increase the viral pathogenicity towards mammals by enhancing the activities of viral polymerase or some other pathways. Multiple amino acid mutations in IAV polymerase proteins, such as PB2-E627K, are associated with high pathogenicity in mammals [10]. Substituting PB2-E627K can not only enhance the activity of polymerase proteins in mammalian and human cells but also contribute to the replication of influenza viruses in these cells. These two biological characteristics are closely related to the high pathogenicity of influenza viruses in mammals. However, there is a surprising lack of the E627K mutation in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus lineage. Instead, mutations at positions 590 and 591 of PB2 were detected, increasing polymerase activity [11].As of now, researchers have used two methods to accurately understand the occurrence of IAV pathogenic enhancement: examining the changes that have occurred on influenza virus in the past and monitoring the evolution of influenza virus cultivation in human cells in the laboratory. However, these methods can only observe a small part of the many possible changes occurring in viruses at the genetic level and may neglect extra mutation sites and possible evolutionary pathways for zoonoses in the future. To overcome this potential problem, Soh et al. [12] mutated every single amino acid of influenza A PB2 one by one. Subsequently, they tested if the changes could help the virus grow better in human cells and enhance pathogenicity. In humans, IDV targeted antibodies have been found, especially in those individuals exposed to cattle for an extended period, indicating that the virus may infect humans. Moreover, the ferrets, which are good infectious animal models of the human influenza virus, are also susceptible [13]. It can be used to predict the possibility that IDV may have the ability to invade the lower respiratory tract, resulting in more severe symptoms. Unlike ICV, IDV can replicate well in cell cultures at 37 °C, which is the exact temperature of human lungs. Similarly, the HEF of IDV has a more open receptor binding region than that of ICV, indicating that IDV has a wider range of cell tropism [14]. Therefore, IDV may infect the lower respiratory tract of humans only via some adaptive genetic variations.In this study, we created a random mutation library of the PB2 IDV viral polymerase subunit to test which amino acid point mutations in influenza D viruses will increase viral polymerase activity, leading to increased pathogenicity. Though with luck, the influenza D virus has not spread widely to cause a pandemic. However, understanding the changes in the polymerase of the influenza D virus can help to learn the increased pathogenicity of the virus and its adaptation to new hosts, which could be an essential factor that scientists need to consider when assessing the risk in future epidemics.Materials and methodsCell cultureHEK 293T-cells were maintained in D10 media (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin). All cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma.Plasmid constructionThe pCAGGS vector used in the experiment was stored in the laboratory. The sequence of PB2 (serial number: JQ922305), PB1 (serial number: JQ922306), P3 (serial number: JQ922307), and NP (serial number: JQ922309) of the first influenza D virus D/Swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 published on Genbank, were sent to Anhui General Biosystems Co., Ltd. for gene synthesis. Oligo 6.0 and Primer 5.0 software were applied to design the specific primers for 4 gene segments PB2, PB1, P3, and NP of IDV. The primers were sent to Changchun Comatebio Biological Co., Ltd. for synthesis.For the generation of minireplicon reporter constructs for each of the four genomic segments of IDV, the synthesized gene plasmid was used as the template, using specific primers amplified those four fragments with Super-Fidelity Phusion DNA polymerase. The PCR process was carried out following the instructions of the Phusion enzyme, with the following cycle profile: 8 °C 10 s, 55 °C 20 s, 72 °C 90 s, for 30 cycles. Promega's DNA Gel Extraction Kit was used to recover 1% agarose gel electrophoresis target bands of PB2, PB1, P3, and NP. The four recovered PCR products and the pCAGGS vector were digested with NEB BsmB Ι enzyme, and the purified materials were ligated (molar ratio insert-to-vector, 1:10). The transformed JM109 colonies carrying the plasmids were extracted and sent to Changchun Kumei Biological Co., Ltd. for sequencing and identification. Plasmids with correct sequence alignment were named pCAGGS-PB2, pCAGGS-PB1, pCAGGS-P3, and pCAGGS-NP.Design point mutation primers and site-directed mutagenesis were performed at position 627 of pCAGGS-PB2 from E to K (pCAGGS-PB2-627K), position 701 from P to D (pCAGGS-PB2-701D), and position 701 from P to 701N (pCAGGS-PB2-701N).Construction of a random mutation library of the IDV PB2 geneDegenerate Primers were synthesized, carry out gene amplification of the IDV PB2 gene and ligate into the pCAGGS vector. Colony PCR was used to screen for transformants, and the selected positive clones were sequenced for verification. Then, high-purity plasmid extraction was performed.ResultsThe PB2 from the influenza D virus strain D/Swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (Hause et al., 2011) was selected. This strain was the first influenza D virus published on GenBank. PB2 from this strain is representative of PB2 from the influenza D virus (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Phylogenetic tree of Influenza viruses based on PB2 sequences. Red branches on the phylogenies represent influenza A viruses, green branches represent influenza B viruses, blue branches represent influenza C viruses, and purple branches represent influenza D viruses. The black circle represents the strains in this studyFull size imageThe cDNAs of the four genomic segments (PB2, PB1, P3, NP) of the influenza virus D/swine/Oklahoma/1314/2011 (D/OK) were amplified by PCR and cloned individually into the pCAGGS vector. The pCAGGS vector contained the human Pol I promoter and the murine Pol I terminator that directed the precise synthesis of vRNA from one strand. Plasmid construction of pPolI-Luci-NP-D employed seamless cloning technologies, and the plasmid contained the segment-specific non-coding regions of the NP gene and the transcription segments of luciferase protein ORF (Additional file 1: Figure S1).Six protein expression plasmids, including pCAGGS-PB2, pCAGGS-PB1, pCAGGS-P3 and pCAGGS-NP, pPolI-Luci-NP-D, and the internal reference plasmid pRL-TK were used in the Microbial genomics experiment. These six plasmids were co-transfected in 293T cells to express the polymerase complex that can be combined with influenza-like vRNA, which was transcribed by pPolI-Luci-NP-D to form influenza-like vRNPs and expressed the firefly luciferase. Luciferin was used as a substrate to detect firefly luciferase, and coelenterazine was used as another substrate to detect Renilla luciferase. When the substrate of the renilla luciferase was added, the inhibitor of firefly luciferase was also added at the same time to interrupt the luminescence of Luciferin. So, only renilla luciferase activities could be tested during follow-up detection, achieving the goal with dual-luciferase reporter gene assay (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Construction of a random mutation library of the influenza D viral polymerase PB2 fragments. We mutagenized the 500–700 amino acid codon region of PB2 from an influenza D strain. Screening of unique sites for sequencing through microgenome experimentsFull size imageIn order to confirm whether the changes of key sites 627 and 701 in PB2 could greatly impact influenza D viruses, we designed the point mutation primers to achieve the following mutations: E627K, P701D, and P701N. At key sites 627 and 701, the activity of IDV polymerase was significantly reduced in the E627K mutant compared to the wild type, indicating that the E627K mutation could not enhance viral replication. When it came to the P701D mutation, the IDV polymerase activity increased by 1.47 times, and the P701N mutation could also increase the IDV polymerase activity by 1.20 times (Fig. 3a).Fig. 3Viral polymerase activity. a Polymerase activity at key positions 627 and 701. b Partial site polymerase activity in mutation library. c PB2 D533S and G603Y double mutation polymerase activityFull size imageA library of the PB2 gene was constructed by scanning random mutagenesis in the influenza D virus. This library was used to evaluate polymerase complex activities when the amino acid codons changed in a location range of 500–700 in PB2. We mutagenized 500–700 codons in PB2 to create a replicate mutant plasmid library. Some exact sites that increased polymerase activities in influenza D viruses are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1.Both the single-site mutation of PB2-D533S and PB2-G603Y could increase the activity of IDV polymerase independently. The PB2-D533S mutation alone could increase the polymerase activity by 9.92 times, and the PB2-G603Y mutation alone increased the polymerase activity by 8.22 times (Fig. 3b). In addition to testing the effects of independent mutation on viral polymerase activity, the effects of two sites mutation combinations on polymerase activity were also tested. The test results showed that the two-point combined mutation of PB2-D533S and PB2-G603Y could increase the viral polymerase activity by 1.46 times, which was far lower when compared to the viral polymerase activity increased by these two mutations separately. This may be caused by unknown changes in the viral polymerase structure that result in a down-regulation of the efficiency of enhancing the viral polymerase activity when the two points mutated simultaneously (Fig. 3c).DiscussionAlthough the influenza D virus has not been isolated from humans, a cross-sectional serological study was performed on human serum samples from 35 cattle-exposed and 11 non-cattle-exposed adults to detect IDV antibodies using Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) and Microneutralization (MN) assays. Overall, 94% of the cattle-exposed persons had a positive HI and MN titer. Characteristics of seropositive cattle-exposed persons included: 41% worked with sick cattle, 4% worked with swine diagnosed with respiratory illness, and 41% self-reported febrile illness in the previous year. When testing the people living close to cattle farms (with potential risk for infection), 8 of 741 serum samples collected were positive for HI antibodies (titers ≥ 40) [7].Song et al. have analyzed the biological characteristics of the major surface glycoproteins in both IAV and IDV [14]. It was found that IAV can specifically bind to the receptors of N-Acetylneuraminyl-(2-3)-Galactose (originating in poultry) or N-Acetylneuraminyl-(2-6)-Galactose (human), and some subtypes of IAV can bind to both receptors. The bovine-derived IDV receptors are N-Acetylneuraminyl-(2-3)-Galactose and N-Acetylneuraminyl-(2-6)-Galactose, while the swine-derived IDV receptor is N-Acetylneuraminyl-(2-6)-Galactose, but not N-Acetylneuraminyl-(2-3)- Galactose. These findings suggest that the bovine-derived IDV may be transmitted between species just like IAV and even with more widespread cell tropism [15]. At the same time, the saccharide microarray experiment proves that IDV and ICV are similar in structure. The three-dimensional crystal structure of the HEF protein receptor complex of IDV shows the segments close to the top of HEF1, together with the 230-helix, 270-ring, 170-ring. In addition, unlike in ICV, three amino acids (T239, K235, D269) form a shallow cavity with an open channel, which may be one of the reasons why IDV gets a broader host spectrum [16, 17]. Although deadly infections have not been reported in humans, IDV significance in public health should not be neglected.We can predict the key sites that may influence interspecies transmission by building a random mutation library of the IDV PB2 protein and screening the unique mutation sites. This study used amino acid point mutations at positions 627 and 701 of influenza D viruses. There are two positions in the PB2 protein that affect the growth of influenza A viruses in mammalian cells: the amino acid at position 627 (PB2-627) and the amino acid at position 701 (PB2-701) [10]. Several credible studies have found that there is always an E627K mutation of PB2 in clinical strains isolated from people who had died or were severely infected with specific subtypes of influenza viruses. Furthermore, this phenomenon occurred not only in one influenza subtype, but the PB2-E627K mutation can also be found in multiple isolates from the patients who were seriously infected or died from influenza, including H5N1 H7N7, H7N9, H9N2, and H10N8 subtypes. Hence, the PB2-E627K mutation may be closely related to the high pathogenicity to humans in these influenza subtypes [18,19,20,21]. Mutation D701N in the PB2 protein has been found in human influenza virus subtype H3N2, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1, and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H7N7, which has also been verified to enhance the pathogenicity of influenza virus in mice [22,23,24]. Such mutation can enhance the virus replication capacity in mammals by increasing the viral polymerase activity [25]. We decided to focus on amino acids at positions 627 and 701 in influenza D viruses based on these previous studies. We found that in IDV PB2, mutations of the position 627E and 701P are not the key sites that could affect the activities of influenza D virus polymerase.Based on the results of the amino acid positions at 627 and 701 of IDV PB2, we determined some other amino acids in the IDV PB2 protein and analyzed their effects on polymerase activity. The results have been classified into three sections. First, mutations at specific amino acid sites lead to a reduction in viral polymerase activity or even a loss of the expression capacity of the polymerase protein. Secondly, mutations at some specific amino acid sites show no effect on viral polymerase activity. Thirdly, mutations at specific amino acid sites contribute to increasing the activities of the viral polymerase. The statistical analysis found three amino acid sites (M532, D533, and L534) that had enormous implications for IDV polymerase activities. Mutations M532I, D533S, and L534I increased the polymerase activities by 3.26 times, 9.92 times, and 2.66 times, respectively, indicating that these positions are critical. In addition, mutations at the positions 515–519, such as N515G, D516E, and E519Y, increased the polymerase activities by 4.73 times, 2.26 times, and 2.33 times, respectively. Those positions should be considered and focused on the surveillance efforts of influenza D viruses. Moreover, the screening and characterization of other amino acid sites are still under investigation.Through the study of PB2 protein structure elucidation, residues 256–689 of the PB2 subunit (the PB2-CTD), which comprise the mid, cap-binding, and 627 domains, are highly flexible and could not be resolved in either the apo or promoter-bound states. The two key sites are respectively located in the linker domains and 627 domains of the PB2 protein (Fig. 4), which are too flexible to be elucidated [26]. It makes us think more about the existence of critical sites in the domains that we have not yet determined could affect the activity of influenza D virus polymerase, which may affect the characteristics of interspecies transmission.Fig. 4Schematic diagrams of the domain architecture of the PB2 subunit. The unresolved PB2-CTD is shown as transparent with dashed outlinesFull size imageAs a consequence, our approach represents a strategy to evaluate the capacity of IDV replication and pathogenicity based on the polymerase activity. Accordingly, the results of this research contribute to understanding, assessing, and monitoring the risk of a potential IDV pandemic that may occur in the future. That is a way to identify which of those mutations under observation during the viral surveillance is more likely to cause a significant increase in virus replication, pathogenicity, and even transmission. There are, definitely, some possible additional factors, including environmental and epidemiological factors, etc., not captured in this study. The data on amino acid mutations in this study can be combined with other data revealing evolution to explore the risks of IDV cross-species transmission.ConclusionsIt can be concluded that the E627K mutation in influenza D virus resulted in a significant decrease in viral polymerase activity, while the P701D and P701N mutation would lead to a slight increase in viral polymerase activity. As a result of IDV PB2 protein random mutation library screening, it is found that the PB2-D533S mutation alone could increase the polymerase activity by 9.92 times, and the PB2-G603Y mutation alone could increase the polymerase activity by 8.22 times. Furthermore, the screening and characterization on other amino acid sites of IDV PB2 are still under researching. Our findings are valuable in helping provide important insight into IDV replication fitness mediated by the PB2 protein, facilitate the understanding of IDV replication and pathogenicity in future studies.

It appeared first in Mexico, in March, and quickly infected thousands. Influenza tends to kill the very young and the very old, but this flu was different. It seemed to be severely affecting otherwise healthy young adults.American epidemiologists soon learned of cases in California, Texas, and Kansas. By the end of April, the virus had reached a high school in Queens, where a few kids, returning from a trip to Mexico, had infected a third of the student body. The Mexican government closed its schools and banned large gatherings, and the U.S. considered doing the same. “It was a very scary situation,” Richard Besser, who was then the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told me. Early estimates suggested that the “swine flu,” as the new strain became known, killed as many as fourteen per cent of those it infected—a case fatality rate more than two hundred times higher than typical seasonal flu. The virus soon spread to more than a hundred and fifty countries, and the Obama Administration considered delaying the start of school until after Thanksgiving, when a second wave could be under way. Manufacturers worried about vaccine supplies. Like most flu vaccines, the one for the swine flu was grown in chicken eggs. “Even if you yell at them, they don’t grow faster,” Tom Frieden, who replaced Besser as the director of the C.D.C., said, at a press conference.In the end, the world got lucky. The early stats were misleading: although swine flu was extremely contagious, it wasn’t especially deadly. Sometimes the reverse is true. Avian flu, which spread across the world during the winter of 2005-06, is not particularly transmissible but is highly lethal, killing more than half of those it infects. Each flu virus has its own epidemiological profile, determined by its genetic makeup, and flu genes shift every year. Howard Markel, a physician and historian of epidemics who, in the early two-thousands, helped invent the concept of “flattening the curve,” compared influenza’s swappable genetic components to “two wheels of fortune.” A double whammy—ease of spread combined with lethality—could make COVID-19, or even the 1918 flu, which killed between forty million and a hundred million people, look like a twenty-four-hour bug.After the swine flu’s relatively harmless nature became apparent, many people asked if the alarm it provoked had been warranted. A Swiss survey found that trust in institutions had decreased. Some scientists and officials accused the World Health Organization of stirring up a “faked” pandemic to justify its budget. But most drew the opposite conclusion from the experience. Trying to prepare for a deadly flu pandemic had left them more alarmed. “There was just a sense of overwhelming relief,” Besser said. “If this had been like 1918, we sure weren’t ready.”In truth, we’re never fully ready for the flu. We know it’s coming, like the first fall leaf, and yet three times in the past century—in 1918, 1957, and 1968—it has flattened us, killing a million or more each time. Even in ordinary years, the disease infects a billion people around the world, killing hundreds of thousands; one study estimated that it costs the United States economy close to a hundred billion dollars annually. Our primary weapon against the virus, the flu vaccine, is woefully inadequate. Over the last decade and a half in the United States, flu vaccines have prevented illness only forty per cent of the time; in particularly bad years, when vaccines were less fine-tuned to the strains that were circulating, they were only ten-per-cent protective. Today, the coronavirus pandemic is rightfully the object of our most strenuous efforts. And yet, as the infectious-disease specialists David Morens, Jeffrey Taubenberger, and Anthony Fauci wrote, in a 2009 article in The New England Journal of Medicine, that “we are living in a pandemic era that began around 1918,” when the flu used shipping networks to traverse the world. Since the 1918 pandemic, this century-long, multi-wave pandemic has killed roughly the same number of people.We’ve controlled a vast number of diseases with vaccination—chicken pox, diphtheria, measles, mumps, polio, rabies, rubella, smallpox, tetanus, typhoid, whooping cough, yellow fever—and, to some degree, we’ve added COVID-19 to the list. But the pathogens behind those diseases tend to be relatively static compared with the flu, which returns each year in a vexingly different form. For decades, scientists have dreamed of what some call a “universal” flu vaccine—one that could target many strains of the virus. A universal vaccine would save countless lives not just this year but every year; as those numbers add up, it would become one of the greatest medical breakthroughs in history. Until recently, it’s been beyond the reach of molecular biology. But new technologies are extending our abilities, and researchers are learning how to see through the flu’s disguises. Without knowing it, we’re living on the cusp of a remarkable scientific achievement. One of the world’s longest pandemics could soon be coming to an end.What we call “the flu” is really plural. Every season, several strains circulate. When it’s summer in one hemisphere, flu infections surge in the other. Virologists at the W.H.O. investigate the viruses and share what they learn with pharmaceutical companies; pharmaceutical researchers then often develop quadrivalent vaccines, which target four separate strains simultaneously. It’s the shotgun approach.It takes more than six months to design, test, and manufacture a season’s worth of flu vaccine. In that time, a lot can change. Out in the world, strains mutate, jostling for dominance; prevalent varieties fade away, and sleepers come to the fore. Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan who has advised the Food and Drug Administration on flu-vaccine targeting, told me that choosing strains to target requires “science and a little bit of art.” The selected flu viruses mutate further as a result of vaccine manufacturing. By the time a needle reaches your arm, there’s a good chance that the vaccine might be off target or obsolete.Each strain of the flu can be seen as plural, too. Morrens, Taubenberger, and Fauci explain that “it is helpful to think of influenza viruses not as distinct entities but as eight-member ‘gene teams.’ ” A flu virus, they write, “must sometimes trade away one or more team members to make way for new gene ‘players’ with unique skills.”The surface of a virus is covered by a forest of proteins; as the virus’s genes change, the proteins change along with them. From a vaccine perspective, two proteins are of preëminent importance. The first, hemagglutinin (HA), helps the virus break into cells; the second, neuraminidase (NA), helps it break out of them. The cryptic code names given to flu viruses—H1N1, H3N2, and so on—reflect the dozens of numbered variations in which these proteins come. The variations themselves mutate when the virus reproduces, making vaccine targeting even more difficult: flu vaccines focus on the more vulnerable HA proteins, and must be tailored to fit the newest version of the virus.Some viruses are siloed within a single species. But the flu migrates easily among several species, and this adds to its recombinatory range. “There are hundreds of warm-blooded animals that are routinely infected with flu virus,” Taubenberger, who is the chief of the Viral Pathogenesis and Evolution Section at NIAID, told me. “It can move from birds to horses to pigs to humans.” If a bird is infected with two strains of the flu at once, those strains may combine to create a new virus; that virus, in turn, may enter another animal. In 1918, H1N1 infected humans, who passed the disease on to pigs; the swine flu that so alarmed epidemiologists in 2009 emerged when two of the pig strains converged, then returned to humans. The existence of so-called animal reservoirs for the flu makes it more likely that, in any given year, virologists will confront a radically altered opponent. It also means that herd immunity is nearly impossible to achieve. “Viruses like smallpox or measles or polio that are specifically adapted to humans . . . if you vaccinate enough people to generate herd immunity, you can actually eliminate the virus,” Taubenberger said. “But flu can never be eliminated, because it’s in hundreds of species of animals, and it’s constantly moving around. So, we need a better strategy.”Vaccines contain antigens—complex molecules that prime our immune systems to produce effective antibodies. Sometimes, antigens are synthetic molecules designed to mimic parts of the target virus; in other cases, they are actually real parts of the virus that have been cleaved off. The antigen in the COVID-19 vaccines is a version of the spike-shaped protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter our cells. The flu’s equivalent, the HA protein, looks like a mushroom. Since the nineteen-forties, we’ve made flu vaccines in more or less the same way: researchers grow the virus in eggs, then split it open using chemicals which deactivate the virus but leave the mushroom proteins intact. Unfortunately, when our immune systems build antibodies in response to those proteins, they tend to target the cap of the mushroom, where its most mutable elements reside. Researchers don’t yet understand why our antibodies aim for the most changeable part of our adversary. But it’s not the best outcome—a more effective antibody would attach to and disable the less mutable stem.Börries Brandenburg, a scientific director at Janssen Vaccines, which is part of Johnson & Johnson, told me about how the company has approached the cap problem: “We say, O.K., if the immune system keeps getting fooled by the head of the HA, we’re just going to use the French solution and take off the head. We present the immune system with a molecule that is headless.” Creating a capless mushroom—what the Janssen researchers call a “mini-HA”—is harder than it sounds. Proteins, such as HA, are actually combinations of hundreds of smaller molecules called amino acids; these acids emerge linked together in sequence, like pearls on a necklace, from factories within our cells. Eventually, the necklace twists and curls in on itself, forming a 3-D shape. The mushroom, therefore, can’t be sliced and diced; decapitate it, and the pearls go tumbling. A protein designer who severs its loops must find ways to close them off. When we spoke, Brandenburg’s video-chat backdrop was an Escher illustration of staircases going every which way. As the call ended, I commented that the recursive pathways behind him were reminiscent of looping chains of amino acids. He saw them differently: “This illustrates how research goes,” he said.In 2019, researchers at the Vaccine Research Center, which is part of NIAID, began a clinical trial for a universal vaccine that used another approach. On the surface of a nanoparticle called ferritin—a naturally occurring, spherical assemblage of proteins, used by the body to transport iron in the bloodstream—they arranged a number of mushroom stems in a regular geometric pattern. The immune system responds with special alacrity to orderly arrays of foreign particles; it seems to be more alarmed by soldiers marching in formation than by individuals shambling along. Barney Graham, then the deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center, told me that “one of the keys to solving the universal flu problem” might be “finding new ways of displaying the protein to make it more immunogenic.” (He retired in August.) It’s also possible to stud a nanoparticle not with identical stems but with a variety of caps—the “mosaic” approach. In 2019, scientists at the Vaccine Research Center reported that they’d tested a mosaic flu vaccine on mice; each nanoparticle of the vaccine featured the heads of up to eight different flu strains. It successfully teed up the production of antibodies capable of neutralizing a range of flu viruses that had appeared between 1918 and 2009. This year, the same group reported a mosaic vaccine that could also protect people against avian flu variants that are especially dangerous to humans. A version of the vaccine has entered clinical trials.Other researchers have eschewed decapitation: instead of cutting off the mushroom caps, they replace them. In 2019, NIAID distributed fifty million dollars in grant money to launch the Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers, or CIVICs. A team of grant recipients at Mount Sinai, led by the virologist Florian Krammer, used their money to combine a common stem with an “exotic” cap derived from a bird flu. The exotic cap is useful, oddly, because it elicits a smaller antibody response. The immune system responds strongly to things it’s seen before. Presented with a completely unfamiliar head, it mounts a more vigorous response to the more familiar stem.What unites all of these approaches is the idea that it might be possible to design a perfect antigen—a single entity that inspires universal immunity. Jacob Glanville, a forty-year-old computational “immuno-engineer” who studies antibody targeting, has come up with an alternative path. In 2012, Glanville left Pfizer, where he was a principal scientist, to start an immunology Ph.D. at Stanford and launch an antibody-discovery company called Distributed Bio. Several years earlier, researchers at the biotechnology company Crucell had shown that a few fortunate people already have antibodies that work against many different strains of the flu; Glanville took notice. Somehow, the immune systems of those flu-resistant people had solved most of the universal-immunity problem on their own, without access to designer antigens. Glanville wanted to understand how this was possible, and why it happened so rarely.Every HA protein is different. Any single antibody that works against multiple versions, therefore, must have found a way to attack a shared weak spot. Ideally, our immune systems, when faced with a range of related foes, would seek out their common Achilles’ heel. And yet they do not seem to be very good at identifying areas on proteins that are “conserved” across many variations. Immunologists have offered a few explanations for this weakness. Some have argued that conserved sites too closely resemble our own cellular structures: it would be risky for the immune system to start attacking them with antibodies.Glanville thought that the story might be simpler. Using cloud computing, he ran hundreds of millions of simulations of antibodies attaching to HA proteins. He found that only one in a million antibodies successfully docked to a universally conserved site. The problem, it turned out, was that each viral strain contains many more sites that mutate than conserved sites. This was true even for the stems of the HA mushrooms. The stems may be less mutable than the caps, but they, too, differ more than they are alike. This, Glanville thought, did not bode well for attempts to create stem-based universal vaccines.Still, some people’s immune systems had managed to create near-universal flu antibodies; this suggested that the problem was solvable. Glanville and his team started asking how more immune systems could be persuaded to solve it. They studied every HA protein they had on file from 1918 to 2007, and tried to analyze the differences between them. HA proteins are so complex that assessing their differences is essentially impossible for most human minds. Instead, the team used artificial intelligence to tackle the problem. The A.I. identified the thirty most diverse HA proteins of the past hundred years; afterward, the researchers created an HA cocktail vaccine containing mushroom caps from all of these viruses. Their theory is that, across so many diverse strains, no single mutable part will be consistent. Instead, it’s the conserved features that will stand out. A fugitive in disguise might evade capture, but arrange thirty photos of him in thirty different disguises on a detective’s pinboard, and persistent, identifying features might reveal themselves: one shoulder that’s a little higher than the other, or a nose that’s tilted by half a degree.During the coronavirus pandemic, Operation Warp Speed has funnelled billions of government dollars into vaccine development. The pursuit of a new flu vaccine is a smaller affair. Glanville grew up in a small town in Guatemala—his father owned a bed-and-breakfast, and his mother worked as an artist—and Centivax, the company spun out from Distributed Bio to focus on the flu vaccine and other efforts, does some of its research there, to save on costs. Glanville’s brother, a construction worker, helped the company build a testing facility for the animal trials its researchers conduct on pigs. In 2019, after administering its vaccine to the pigs, Glanville’s team tested the resulting antibodies against influenza strains from 2009 to 2015. The antibodies neutralized all six seasons of the flu, even though the vaccine had been designed using HA proteins that were only as recent as 2007: its immunity was predictive. Two independent labs, funded by the Gates Foundation, have since replicated their results in pigs and ferrets.Centivax is now conducting so-called live-challenge trials, in which scientists vaccinate pigs and ferrets and then deliberately expose them to flu viruses. So far, the results are promising, with some groups of protected animals showing no symptoms and some groups of unprotected animals losing more than ten per cent of their body weight. If more studies go according to plan, human clinical trials will follow. Meanwhile, they’re also developing a universal flu vaccine for the pig market.“There’s financial reasons to do it,” Glanville said. “But also, pigs are your major recombination species. It would probably be a requirement for eradication of influenza. Otherwise, it just keeps popping up.”At one point last year, there were dozens of coronavirus vaccines in development; not all of them have panned out. With vaccines, it’s best to bet on all the horses. Last year, the horse closest to the finish line was Multimeric-001 (M-001), a universal flu vaccine made by the Israeli company BiondVax. That summer, BiondVax’s C.O.O., Elad Mark, gave me a FaceTime tour of the site’s twenty-thousand-square-foot manufacturing facility, in the Jerusalem BioPark. The trials for M-001 were in Phase III, when researchers give a vaccine to thousands of people and perform tests to see if it’s safe and effective. Wearing white protective garb head to foot, Mark walked me through the space, which was crowded with shiny metal machinery for protein production, purification, dilution, and syringe-filling crowded the labs. Most of the action was in the first room, where one white-suited researcher sat at a computer workstation and another collected samples from a tank. “This is Haya,” Mark said, gesturing to the sample collector. “She is our singer. She has an amazing voice, a beautiful voice.”BiondVax and several other promising vaccine companies have taken the approach of targeting T cells, which are another line of immune defense, alongside antibodies. If a virus gets past a host’s antibodies and infects a cell, the immune system attempts to kill that cell, ripping up the viruses it finds and ingesting their particles, called peptides; it then shows these bits to other parts of the immune system as a kind of heads-up. T cells attend to the warnings; the next time they see those peptides, they attack the cells that contain them. T cells are an appealing object for flu-vaccine research because, unlike antibodies, which target proteins on the surfaces of viruses, T cells identify bits of proteins from the viral interior, which tend to remain constant from one strain of flu to another. They look beneath the mushroom.Whereas Glanville, at forty, is committed to studying the flu’s past, Ruth Arnon, the longtime chair of BiondVax’s scientific advisory board, has lived it. Now eighty-eight, she began her research in 1957. At first, she studied the manufacture of synthetic peptides. She and her doctoral adviser were curious about whether these artificial bits could elicit antibodies against entire natural proteins, and found that they could. Focussing on T cells, she successfully developed a universal flu vaccine, tested successfully on mice, in the nineteen-eighties, before launching into human research with her colleague Tamar Ben-Yedidia, in the nineties. For two decades, they surveyed the genetic sequences of many strains of flu, and created synthetic peptides that evoked nine conserved regions from three proteins: HA and internal proteins called NP (nucleoprotein) and M1 (matrix 1).The resultant vaccine, M-001, had been through five Phase II trials with promising results. In one study, the antibodies of elderly participants who’d received the vaccine in 2011 and 2012 were found to neutralize the strains of the flu that struck during the winter of 2014-15. In Phase III, medical professionals administered the vaccine to thousands of participants, age fifty and older, across Eastern Europe in 2018 and 2019. Arnon has become accustomed to sitting on the edge of her seat. Still, last year, as the trial was wrapping up—and as COVID was bearing down across Europe—she was in an agony of anticipation. “The tension is dramatic,” she told me. If the results from the trials showed that M-001 offered greater than seventy-per-cent protection against that year’s flu strains, then the F.D.A. and European Medicines Agency could approve it for commercial use within two years—perhaps even sooner, given the risk of a coronavirus-influenza “twindemic.”Haya’s singing ability aside, the real star of my BiondVax tour was a three-hundred-litre cylindrical fermentation tank. It was about the size of a home fridge, and, inside, genetically engineered bacteria produced the vaccine, a string of peptides. The fermentation process was not much different from making a microbrew; from start to syringe, Mark explained, production took about two days, allowing the facility to produce ten to forty million doses a year. Building it, Mark said, had cost about fifteen million dollars—a risky investment before the vaccine had been approved. He argued that the jump start would avoid a delay to market: “If we waited to get approval, and only then designed, constructed, and validated the facility, it would take us at least three years.”In 2020, people in South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia showed up at their doctors’ offices with flu-like symptoms. They subjected their nasal cavities to cotton swabs; medical personnel chilled the samples and sent them to National Influenza Centres in Melbourne, São Paulo, Cape Town, and elsewhere. Researchers at those centers genetically sequenced the flu viruses that they found, and sent a selection of samples on to the W.H.O., which performed further testing. From these data, the W.H.O. selected, in February of this year, the flu strains to target with the Northern Hemisphere flu shots. Those shots are available now; perhaps you got one. Meanwhile, the same process unfolded on a staggered schedule in the Global North. In September, the W.H.O. recommended targets for the Southern Hemisphere’s next flu season.Every six months, it’s the same gamble. The virus turns its wheels of fortune, rearranging its genes; we make our preparations and hope for the best. Arnon, Glanville, and other researchers look to change the game. (Researchers at several companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, are pursuing mRNA flu vaccines, but it’s early days.) The flu, for its part, threatens to mutate in ways for which we’re unprepared.For now, we remain on the cusp of a breakthrough that could neutralize our foe. A few months after my tour, BiondVax announced the results of its Phase III trial. The researchers found that, in a randomized, double-blind test involving more than twelve thousand people, M-001 did not significantly reduce the incidence or severity of the flu. “For now, the M-001 vaccine candidate remains on the shelf, and we may return to it in the future,” Joshua Phillipson, the company’s director of business development and investor relations, told me. A new C.E.O. has been appointed; in a recent letter to shareholders, he promises to diversify the company’s risk “along several axes” in the future. It has begun a new collaboration with the Max Planck Society, in Germany, focussed on new immune molecules called nanobodies. Arnon, needless to say, was disappointed. On the other hand, she knows from experience how slow the going can be right up until the finish line. In 1996, the F.D.A. approved Copaxone, a drug Arnon developed, for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It was a huge leap forward in treatment for the disease, and ushered in what felt like an instant transformation for patients all across the world. For Arnon, however, the approval was the culmination of a long and arduous process; developing the drug had taken twenty-nine years. “The first time that you see that you can prevent infection with something that you synthesize by your own hands, there is an excitement that can’t be really explained in words,” she said. Still, “you have to be patient. And you have to live long.”More Science and TechnologyWhat happens when patients find out how good their doctors really are?Life in Silicon Valley during the dawn of the unicorns?The end of food.The histories hidden in the periodic table.The detectives who never forget a face.What is the legacy of Laika, the first animal launched into orbit?Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.Matthew Hutson is a contributing writer at The New Yorker covering science and technology.More:MedicineSciencePublic HealthVaccinesVirusesInfluenzaFlu SeasonRead MoreThe LedeShould Political Violence Be Addressed Like a Threat to Public Health?Treating political violence as a contagion could help safeguard the future of American democracy.By Michael LuoCommentTrump’s Health, and OursStudies increasingly suggest that a healthy nation depends on a healthy democracy.By Dhruv KhullarAmerican ChroniclesThe Americans Prepping for a Second Civil WarMany now believe that the U.S. could descend into political violence.

Most cases are of the H3N2 lineage — a strain that health experts say is particularly troublesome, as it tends to mutate faster than other variants of influenza. The last time H3N2 was the dominant strain was during the 2017-18 flu season, when the U.S. had 710,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 52,000 flu-related deaths, the most since the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic. A CDC map shows influenza rates.CDCThe CDC has been investigating a flu outbreak at the University of Michigan, where hundreds of students have tested positive. Flu outbreaks have been reported at other college campuses in the past month. Experts are concerned that college students and other young people who may have been exposed to flu could spread it around the country as they travel home for the holidays. “This is the time of the year when many people are going to be gathering together for the holidays for either Thanksgiving, Christmas or New Year's, and there’s just the potential to amplify it,” said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto.He said people, especially those most at risk for severe disease, should get vaccinated, because the virus doesn’t stay within a particular age group for long. “It’s coming. It’s not quite clear how large a flu season we’re going to have, but we are going to have a flu season,” he said. Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe flu season typically runs from October to as late as May, with activity tending to peak from December to February, according to the CDC. Influenza experts had previously said they were concerned that the country could be at risk for a severe flu season this year after seasonal flu cases reached an all-time low last year, when large parts of the country were shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic. Experts urge people to get both Covid and flu vaccinations, saying an increase in flu infections this winter could put more burden on the country’s health care system, which is already dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases.

Posted by: Blog Editor, Posted on: 26 November 2021 - Categories: Avian Flu Updated on 6/01/22 A record number of cases of avian influenza, or ‘bird flu’ as it’s commonly known, have been confirmed across England, Scotland, and Wales in wild and captive birds this winter (2021/22). Bird flu is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds and there are many different types. Some strains of bird flu can pass to humans but this is extremely rare. It usually requires very close contact with an infected bird so the risk to humans is considered very low. The Food Standards Agency has also said that on the basis of the current scientific evidence, avian influenza also poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. Everyone should follow FSA’s food safety and hygiene advice. An avian influenza outbreak can occur at any point in the year. However, the UK typically faces a seasonal increase in the risk of an avian influenza associated with the winter migration patterns of wild birds. Infected wild waterfowl can then infect local and sedentary wild bird species, poultry or other captive birds resulting in local transmission either directly between birds or indirectly by birds coming into contact with environmental contamination, including faeces and feathers from infected birds. Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) together with its delivery agency the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) is responsible for responding to and managing of avian influenza in poultry and other captive birds. APHA also carries out year-round avian influenza surveillance of dead wild birds submitted via public reports and warden patrols. That surveillance, together with regular risk assessments help government, industry and the general public understand the level of risk avian influenza wild birds pose to poultry and other captive birds at different points in the year. The UKHSA has put measures in place to monitor all individuals who have had contact with confirmed cases of avian influenza in birds to monitor their health and give prophylactic anti-virals to reduce the chances of them becoming unwell. What are the different types of avian flu? Viruses consist of proteins and avian influenza viruses are classified using the H and N proteins. There are 16 different H proteins and 9 N proteins in birds and any combination of these is possible. The H5 and H7s are considered to be the most important from an animal health perspective. There are 5 strains that have caused public health concern in in recent years: H7N9, H9N2, H5N6, H5N8 and a type of H5N1 strain more common in Asia. Although none of these strains easily infect people and aren't usually spread from human to human, several people have been infected around the world, leading to a number of deaths. In February 2021, H5N8 was found to have infected a small number of people at a single site for the first time in Russia and in China recently, there have been increased numbers of human cases of H5N6, as well as the first detection in Laos. The situation is being closely monitored by international agencies. Currently in the UK there have been both findings in wild birds and confirmed cases in poultry and captive birds of the ‘Eurasian’ H5N1 strain of avian influenza. This ‘Eurasian’ H5N1 strain of avian influenza is highly pathogenic to poultry and other birds, but the risk to human health is considered very low. This strain can be clearly distinguished from the previous ‘Asian’ H5N1 strains because they belong to a different subgroup. Only one case of H5 has been confirmed in a person in the UK, in early 2022. The person acquired the infection from very close, regular contact with a large number of infected birds, which they kept in and around their home over a prolonged period of time. Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person. What is the risk of humans contracting avian influenza? Transmission from an infected bird to a human is very rare with fewer than 5 cases recorded in the UK. While previous cases were confirmed as the H7 strain, January 2022 was the first time H5 has been detected in a human in the UK. The risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low. However, people should not touch sick or dead birds. What role does UKHSA play? While the current evidence suggests that these strains don’t spread easily to or between people, viruses constantly evolve and that is why UKHSA has monitoring in place to ensure we pick up any early evidence that the virus has jumped from birds to humans. UKHSA follows up all individuals who have been in contact with a confirmed case of avian influenza without the appropriate protective equipment. We contact them daily to see if they have developed symptoms so that we can take appropriate action if so. People will also be offered anti-viral treatment after recent exposure to the virus. This is to stop the virus replicating in their body if they have picked it up and should prevent them from becoming unwell. It also works to stop them passing it on. We also swab people even if they don’t have symptoms, to help surveillance programmes and our understanding of the virus if they were to develop it. What action should the public take? It is really important that people do not touch dead or sick birds. Infected wild birds can appear in the countryside and in towns and cities so if you see a dead bird in your area, do not touch it. Instead report it to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77. APHA on behalf of Defra will then collect some of these birds and test them to help government understand how the disease is distributed geographically and in different types of bird, not all birds will be collected. Wild birds are susceptible to a range of diseases/injuries and not all dead birds will have been infected with avian influenza. If avian influenza is confirmed in wild birds, UKHSA put in place measures to reduce the risk to people who have come in contact with the dead birds. If you are a bird keeper you must keep a close watch on your birds for signs of disease and maintain good biosecurity at all times. If you suspect any type of avian influenza in poultry or captive birds you must report it immediately by calling in England the Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. In Wales, contact 0300 303 8268. In Scotland, contact your local Field Services Office. If you experience any symptoms of bird flu and have been in close contact (within 1 metre) of a confirmed case of avian influenza in domestic or wild birds in the past 10 days, it is important that you seek medical advice from a GP or by calling NHS 111. Your symptoms can be checked over the phone. It is also important to report any recent international travel, as bird flu is a disease that occurs globally and some countries present an increased risk. What happens when the disease is confirmed in poultry or captive birds? UK has robust biosecurity measures and monitoring in place to prevent the disease spreading. When avian influenza is confirmed or suspected in poultry or other captive birds, disease control zones are put in place around the infected premises to prevent onward spread. Within these zones, a range of restrictions can apply. For more information on the current situation in the UK including areas where cases have been confirmed, Defra provides live updates here. UKHSA is meeting regularly with animal and public health experts from across the UK to monitor the situation and ensure all appropriate public health actions are taken.

(Unsplash: Max Kleinen)abc.net.auews/bird-flu-avian-influenza-disease-chickens-poultry-animals-humans/100627498Link copiedShareShare articleThe COVID-19 pandemic may have crushed seasonal flu to historically low levels, but another type of flu — avian influenza or bird flu — has showed no signs of slowing.In the past month, severe bird flu has popped up in poultry farms across Europe and Asia, with Japan confirming its third outbreak for the winter season so far.The outbreaks follow Japan's worst winter for bird flu yet. More than 3 million chickens were destroyed in 2020-21.Closer to home, six Victorian farms, including an emu farm, culled hundreds of thousands of birds in 2020 and early 2021 after multiple outbreaks involving three different strains of the virus.Loading...While bird flu viruses do generally stick to infecting birds, they occasionally make the potentially deadly leap to other animals, including humans.In May, for instance, the first confirmed human case of a rare bird flu subtype was reported in China.Ricardo Soares Magalhães, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Queensland, says this recent spate of new bird flu strains that can hop to humans is unusual."Usually, you'd see these viruses just affecting the poultry population, and very few human cases, or none at all," Dr Soares Magalhães said."But most of the different examples we've had in the last year-and-a-half have been viruses that had some human transmission."And despite the COVID-19 pandemic being driven by a coronavirus, epidemiologists are "very wary" when it comes to emerging flu strains, he added, with influenza still at the top of pandemic-potential diseases.What is bird flu and where does it come from?Bird flu is caused by a handful of influenza viruses, just like the seasonal flu that circulates each winter.ABCs of Hs and Ns:Influenza A viruses, which infect humans and animals, are classified into subtypes depending on two spike proteins that cover their surface:haemagglutininneuraminidaseThere are 18 different haemagglutinin (H1 to H18) and 11 neuraminidase (N1 to N11) proteinsEach virus has one type of H and one type of N (such as H1N1 and H3N2)But while seasonal flu infections rise in cool weather, drop off in spring and spread easily in human populations, bird flu — with the odd exception — is transmitted only between animals or from animals to humans.It mostly circulates in wild birds, and spreads when migratory waterfowl fly between their summer and winter homes.Larger birds, such as ducks and geese, tend to ferry bird flu viruses around the world, said Frank Wong, a CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory microbiologist and World Organisation for Animal Health reference expert for highly pathogenic and low pathogenic avian influenza.(Generally, if smaller migratory birds such as shorebirds are infected with bird flu, they're more likely to delay their migration, or not set out on their journey at all.)And now, it's peak autumn waterfowl migration time in the northern hemisphere, which is why European and Asian countries are seeing an uptick in bird flu outbreaks, Dr Wong added.Three black swans at Beijing's Old Summer Palace were infected with H5N8 avian influenza at the start of the year. (Unsplash: Bruce Jastrow)"When the birds congregate [to feed and breed] … mixing of birds also results in mixing of viruses, including influenza viruses. Then when the birds fly south or westwards for the winter, they carry those viruses with them."If those wild birds interact with domestic birds, the viruses they're carrying might spill over and cause outbreaks in domestic poultry."Free-range farming may increase spillover odds too.Loading YouTube contentMost bird flu viruses out there are low pathogenic strains, causing little to no disease to the wild birds that carry them.But the problem is they can quickly become highly pathogenic, incredibly contagious and lethal.Once a highly pathogenic bird flu virus has made its way into a poultry farm, it can spread rapidly and devastate entire flocks.What's the bird flu situation in Australia?Australia is in a pretty good place when it comes to bird flu.There have been only eight outbreaks of the disease in Australia since the 1970s, with the biggest happening in Victoria last year.Unlike Europe and Asia, Australia has no large waterfowl seasonal migrations from abroad, which bring in new viruses each year, Dr Wong said."Australian wild ducks are different species to migratory ducks and geese up in the northern hemisphere."Our endemic species of ducks are what we call nomadic. They don't travel according to the seasons — they mainly stay within the Australo-Papuan region — and they move according to drought and rain cycles."Australia also has stringent controls around how poultry is shuttled into and around the country.What are the symptoms of bird flu in poultry?Sudden deathDifficulty breathing, such as coughing, sneezing, or raspingSwelling and purple discolouration of the head, comb, wattles and neckRapid drop in eating, drinking and egg productionRuffled feathers, dopiness, closed eyesDiarrhoeaAnd the National Avian Influenza Wild Birds surveillance programme analyses bird poo and the like to keep tabs on the low-pathogenic H7 strains circulating in the wild, Dr Wong said.Among other biosecurity measures, local regulations state that poultry farms cannot be located near lakes or other bodies of water, Dr Soares Magalhães said: "Just being a few kilometres away can be a risk factor."That's because the virus doesn't always need direct contact or faeces to spread between birds."Because it's a respiratory virus, it can be aerosolised at very large distances. So having those water bodies nearby will attract wild birds, and that means you will have a greater chance of transmission through the air."Still, these measures aren't completely watertight. And if bird flu is detected in an Australian poultry farm, the policy is clear.Because some bird flu subtypes have been known to infect humans, any culling or depopulation is conducted in full PPE. (Getty Images: The Asahi Shimbun)"In Australia, we don't want these viruses around, so regardless of if it's a low pathogenic strain or a high pathogenic strain, depopulation is the way to go," Dr Soares Magalhães said.Depopulation — or culling — may seem an extreme measure, but the disease can quickly cause debilitation and death, especially if it's a highly pathogenic strain."The best strategy from an animal welfare perspective is to depopulate the flock," Dr Soares Magalhães said."That happens on a radius of 3 kilometres around the affected zone, and then we impose a surveillance zone out to another 7km."So that's birds. What about humans?For a human to get bird flu, they need direct contact with infected birds, or contaminated feathers or faeces. It can't be passed on by eating eggs and cooked meat.So far, there's been very little human-to-human bird flu transmission, but that doesn't mean new strains won't gain that ability, Dr Soares Magalhães said."COVID [which probably originated in bats] is a good example of that."Pigs can be infected with more than one flu virus, and if that happens, they can act as a virus mixing vessel of sorts to produce new viruses.Avian Influenza H5N1 virus particles (depicted in gold), grown in kidney cells (green), as seen using an electron microscope. (Supplied: CDC/Cynthia Goldsmith)Influenza's genetic code, which dictates qualities such as the animals it infects and its contagiousness, is stored as a strand of RNA. If two (or more) influenza viruses meet in a pig's body, they can swap sections of that RNA strand.Most of the time, these mutations die out. Occasionally, they might spawn a particularly pathogenic strain."The H5N1 virus is a good example of a virus that emerged through the interaction of a poultry virus with a swine virus, and has elements of a human virus," Dr Soares Magalhães said."But there are some exceptions to that rule."H7N9 is a virus that did not need a pig at all. It came straight from chickens to human beings."Which are the viruses to watch?Of the different bird flu viruses, H5 and H7 subtypes have the propensity to mutate from low to high pathogenic strains.The H5N1 subtype, for instance, was first detected in a human in Hong Kong in the 1990s and, in 2003, kicked off a major bird flu outbreak, killing at least 280 people.There have been more than 860 confirmed cases of H5N1 in humans to date, 456 of whom died."The current lineage of highly pathogenic H5 that's causing outbreaks in the northern hemisphere has adapted to be more amenable for infection in many different wild bird species, including ducks and geese," Dr Wong said."This has allowed it to have this rapid seasonal spread, when the conditions are right."Then there's H7N9, which was first reported in humans in China in 2013. It has been reported in more than 1,500 people since and can cause severe disease.In January 2014, Hong Kong temporarily banned live chicken sales after a supplier tested positive for H7N9 bird flu. (Getty Images: Lam Yik Fei)What makes this virus trickier to contain is that it doesn't produce many symptoms in birds."That virus is actually a little more insidious," Dr Wong said."When a low-pathogenic H7N9 circulates in chickens or ducks, it's harder to spot because the chickens or ducks may not show signs of disease."And the right interplay of genes that virus carried [allowed] multiple spillovers into humans."Just recently, a third H type was found in humans. China reported that a H10N3 virus hospitalised a 41-year-old man.When it was detected in birds, epidemiologists weren't overly concerned about it spilling over into humans, because there's no history of H10 viruses infecting us, Dr Soares Magalhães said."But then there was a human infection as a result of that virus, and the mechanism of transmission was similar to H7N9, whereby there was no indication of pig involvement."So how worried should we be about a bird flu pandemic?The COVID-19 pandemic has seen more funding made available for surveillance programs for diseases such as bird flu.But even before the pandemic, regions where most bird flu strains first popped up — such as China — really stepped up their poultry farm biosecurity strategies, Dr Soares Magalhães said."China will perhaps be the location where new viruses emerge, but they will stop it very quickly."So it's very much a watch and wait scenario, but we might not have to wait too long.Dr Soares Magalhães's spatial epidemiology group is helping a World Health Organization program rank countries in South-East Asia according to their capabilities to control diseases that, like bird flu, can jump from animals to humans.Poultry can be vaccinated against bird flu, but it's expensive, and means the birds cannot be traded as they may be infected but asymptomatic. (Getty Images: China Photos)But the part of the world he has an eye on is further afield."It's very likely that new viruses will start to emerge; not in the traditional countries where that has happened, but in [what was known as] the Eastern Bloc," Dr Soares Magalhães said.Even though the biosecurity of farms in the region has been scaled up in the past couple of decades, it "still tends to be suboptimal", he said.Neighbouring Poland is currently grappling with multiple outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu."Poland is the largest poultry producer in Europe, so they have the largest at-risk population."No wonder Poland is bearing the brunt of this."Climate change could encourage new strains of bird flu to emerge too. As the world warms, migratory birds may spend winter elsewhere, and mix with different bird populations — and viruses."Every single year, we will have wildlife-originated influenza viruses in the poultry population, and I'm sure there will be a time when a virus similar to H5N1 will pop up," Dr Soares Magalhães said."There's a lot of naive poultry populations out there, and this gives a lot of opportunities for these new emerging viruses to really be devastating."Everyone is expecting a big resurgence in the next few years."Posted Mon 22 Nov 2021 at 6:00pmMonday 22 Nov 2021 at 6:00pmMon 22 Nov 2021 at 6:00pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

Partners View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Once again, Europe is experiencing bird flu outbreaks – the deadliest animal disease known. In chickens and turkeys, over 90% of an affected flock will die within a couple of weeks, although in ducks and geese the disease may be milder. Bird flu outbreaks are caused by avian influenza viruses, most of which cause mild infection in birds, but two sub-types (called H5 and H7) can occur as a very deadly virus. Flu viruses have a high mutation rate and can exchange genes when two viruses simultaneously infect a single host. These genetic changes allow them to change their make up and escape immunity in their host and continue spreading. In the previous century, epidemics of the deadly bird flu were rare and always originated from mild H5 or H7 viruses that mutated into a deadly virus while transmitting in a chicken or turkey flock. Until 1996, resulting outbreaks and epidemics were either effectively controlled or faded out due to a lack of susceptible hosts. H5N1 emerges Infections caused by these deadly viruses were also never seen in wild birds. This changed after the emergence of the H5N1 virus in China. Outbreaks in poultry were not effectively controlled. The virus gradually expanded its territory across China, and from 2003, further into Asia and Africa. Humans in close contact with infected poultry could become infected, resulting in the death of 456 people to date. Wild birds became infected because of a spillover from the ongoing spread of the virus in poultry. This gave rise to new H5 viruses that were still deadly to poultry, but of little harm to certain waterbird species. Consequently, migratory waterbirds could fly thousands of kilometres, despite being infected by these viruses, and so were able to spread the viruses over very large distances. In 2005, wild waterbirds introduced the virus to Europe for the first time during fall migration. This was the first sign that the ecology of these viruses had completely changed; a virus strictly associated with poultry had adapted itself to wild water birds, tremendously increasing its survival potential. Each year in spring and summer, waterbirds mingle on their breeding grounds in Siberia and mix their influenza viruses, creating new variants they then bring to Europe, Asia and Africa during fall migration, causing deadly outbreaks in poultry. Obviously, there is little we can do to control infections in the wild water birds. Surveillance is recommended to assess the risk of virus exposure to poultry and the removal of carcasses of dead birds from the environment. Officials in the Ivory Coast burn slaughtered poultry after finding avian influenza in the city of Bassam. Legnan Koula/EPA Poultry farmers in areas with many waterbirds that stay there over winter are advised to keep poultry inside and should implement biosecurity measures to keep the virus out of their sheds. Faeces of infected wild birds can contain high amounts of virus and can easily enter a poultry shed by uncleaned boots or materials. Current biosecurity programmes have not been sufficiently effective to prevent infections in risk areas. In the season 2020-21 there were over 1,000 outbreaks in the EU alone. And in the current season, tens of outbreaks have already been detected. The yearly recurring outbreaks, with the associated mass killing of poultry, are an obvious threat to the sustainability of poultry farming. Poultry vaccine Vaccination could be a tool to help solve the problem. However, it is forbidden in many countries and its use results in trade barriers for poultry. The reason for the trade barriers is that most current vaccines prevent disease, but don’t stop transmission of the infection. A vaccine that stops disease but doesn’t stop transmission will result in “silent” virus spread, which compromises outbreak control and is undesirable because the virus has the potential to spread from animals to humans. Fortunately, most of the currently circulating H5 virus variants are not as dangerous to humans as their ancestor H5N1. Still, caution is needed as this could easily change because of the virus’s ability to change its genetic code. We urgently need effective vaccines for poultry – it is the only sustainable solution. New-generation vaccines may have more potential to control bird flu, but their effectiveness to stop virus transmission should be demonstrated in the field. Such vaccines will not only protect poultry but also minimise exposure of humans to the virus.

Now, they could cure all kinds of other diseases From HIV to cancer to influenza, researchers say that mRNA vaccines have tremendous medical potential By Matthew Rozsa Staff Writer Published November 21, 2021 7:30PM (EST) Virus cell with messenger RNA or mRNA vaccine (Getty Images/libre de droit) -- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email The COVID-19 pandemic is what historians refer to as an "inflection point," or a single event that has a dramatic and sweeping effect on the human story. In the case of this particular event, it changed the way we work, raised awareness about public health policy, contributed to the toppling of a president — and, in the field of medicine, resulted in a leap forward for vaccine technology. Indeed, one of the great unsung achievements amid the pandemic was how scientists from around the world worked together to create multiple effective vaccines in less than a year. Yet what may prove most historic is the biotechnology that emerged from the pandemic. Specifically, the vision of an mRNA vaccine went from dream to reality. And the successful creation of a viable mRNA vaccine could have repercussions for the way diseases are treated for centuries. That technology, whose development was quickened by the pandemic, is already being studied to treat other diseases. Earlier this month, scientists at Yale University created a prototype mRNA vaccine that protected guinea pigs from tick-borne diseases by training their immune systems to recognize and fight proteins found in tick saliva. They hope that, with some further development, this could be used to help humans avoid developing Lyme disease if a tick bites them. Yet this is merely one example of mRNA vaccines' potential, revealing how they have far more utility than merely fighting COVID-19. Indeed, mRNA vaccines are something of a holy grail of medical innovation — and researchers believe that mRNA vaccines and their underlying biotechnology could be used to fight diseases like HIV, cancer, and influenza. The promise of mRNA vaccines As their name suggests, mRNA vaccines depend on the nucleic acid known as RNA. RNA is a molecule similar to DNA, but it is single-stranded (DNA is double-stranded) and plays a large number of roles in keeping your cells alive and healthy. But don't think they are unique to humans: They are found in all living things. There are also certain types of viruses — like SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 — that could be characterized as little more than RNA strands surrounded by protein shells. Like all viruses, they take over cells and force them to churn out other copies of themselves, the worst kind of mooch you can imagine. Yet RNA and mRNA are not precisely the same thing. mRNA refers to "messenger RNA," a specific type of RNA that (as indicated by its name) transmits information from genetic codes in the nucleus to the cytoplasm where proteins are manufactured. This hints at how mRNA vaccines work, which is essentially by giving your cells a blueprint of a part of a virus, and then having them manufacture what they need on their own. Previously, vaccines contained either a dead or weakened version of a pathogen, which the immune system would then learn to recognize. But mRNA vaccines don't actually contain any of a live or dead virus; instead, they contain a set of instructions (in mRNA) that infects some of the host's cells and makes them spit out a piece of protein associated with a pathogen. One's cells never manufacture the actual virus; only a piece of its "shell," say. Those pieces are then detected by the immune system and identified and destroyed. It would be a bit like learning the presence of a criminal by identifying the look of their clothing, rather than the criminal themselves. In the case of the mRNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna, the mRNA contains instructions for one's cells on how to create the spike protein. The spike proteins are the little points that emerge out of the coronavirus, like spines jutting from a sea urchin, and they are what the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to enter your cells and get you sick with COVID-19. The mRNA vaccines have been extraordinarily successful in protecting the vaccinated; even though they have not entirely thwarted breakthrough cases, they significantly reduce the likelihood of getting sick, and the people who do develop infections with evasive mutant variants rarely become seriously ill. Most notably, mRNA vaccines were the first ones to be released on the market, with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna winning the vaccine race exactly one year ago this month.

The next mRNA vaccines In terms of their world-changing potential, mRNA vaccines have two key characteristics: They are quick to make, as demonstrated by the speed with which Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna came out with their products, and by their very nature they are versatile. As the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) wrote in March, mRNA vaccine technology has the potential to treat diseases like malaria and cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and hepatitis B. All scientists will have to do is modify RNA strands as needed to account for the different antigens (foreign substances recognized by the immune system as threats) produced by each pathogen. Instead of making do with the materials immediately available to them, mRNA vaccines make it possible for scientists to create more specialized weapons based on detailed knowledge of their enemies' specific characteristics. Take the influenza epidemic. One so-called "holy grail" of immunology is a universal influenza vaccine. Right now there are four influenza viruses in circulation, all of which evolve so quickly that vaccines which were effective in one year may be obsolete by the next. This puts manufacturers in a crunch, as it takes at least six months to create the conventional vaccinations with attenuated viruses grown inside chicken eggs. The final product, though almost always safe, has a very hit-and-miss rate of effectiveness. An mRNA vaccine, by contrast, could in theory be designed to effectively fight all four strains and be quickly modified as necessary when they evolve. In addition, while conventional vaccine platforms have to hit a precise target in order to destroy a given intruder, an mRNA vaccine could target multiple parts of an influenza virus at once, overwhelming it with a full-body assault that can't be easily shaken off. In fact, we already know that the early stages of mRNA flu vaccines were effective because scientists used that research to help develop their COVID-19 vaccines. This speaks to how malleable the platform is: While conventional vaccine platforms require patients to hope that the pathogen injected into their body is similar enough to a possible flu infection to be effective, mRNA vaccines could be precisely designed to meet the specific characteristics of each new strain as it emerges. There will be challenges to pulling this off, of course. Anna Blakney, an RNA bioengineer at the University of British Columbia, told the journal Nature that there is no guarantee mRNA will be an effective vehicle for transporting haemagglutinin glycoproteins, the protein that flu vaccines use to fight the different bugs. As Blakney put it, "Did we just get really incredibly lucky with COVID vaccines because of the antigen design and the immunodominancy of that protein? Or have we stumbled on something that's functional for other viral glycoproteins as well?" In addition to aiding in the war against influenza, mRNA vaccines could also be a game-changer in the fight against cancer. In the pre-mRNA vaccine world, the mere notion of a "cancer vaccine" would have seemed ludicrous; vaccines work by protecting your body against a foreign invader, and cancers (as far as we know) are caused by your own body producing mutated cells. Yet just as an mRNA vaccine can help your immune system recognize and destroy proteins associated with dangerous pathogens, they could in theory be developed to identify and eliminate proteins associated with cancer cells — and, of course, the cancer cells themselves. "A successful therapeutic cancer vaccine should induce strong T cell responses, particularly with CD8+ T cells, which have a known capacity to kill malignant cells," Dr. Norbert Pardi, whose research led to the develop of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, explained to the University of Pennsylvania. "Therapeutic cancer vaccines would be given to cancer patients with the hope that those vaccine-induced cytotoxic T cells would clear tumor cells." HIV mRNA vaccines are theorized to be possible, though there are massive hurdles to be overcome. The challenge so far has been that none of the vaccine candidates developed up to this point have produced broadly neutralizing antibodies, which are vital to blocking HIV in target cells. Scientists hope that an mRNA vaccine would create an immunogen (an antigen that induces an immune response) that resembles the HIV virus and can help the body develop those broadly neutralizing antibodies against it. Unfortunately, researchers are still very early in working through this, and it seems like a HIV vaccine using this technology is not in the near future. "We certainly think that an HIV vaccine will be far and away the most complicated vaccine that we've ever had to put into the population," Derek Cain of Duke University's Human Vaccine Institute told The Guardian. "We don't expect it to work 100% or 90% like the Covid vaccines, but even if we can get to 50-60% that would be a success; 70% would be amazing." What comes next The future for mRNA technology is not one of unbounded promise. As the AAMC noted, each virus poses its own individual puzzle, which makes it unlikely that other ailments can be treated with the rapid success that occurred when fighting COVID-19. Similarly, although the COVID-19 vaccines have so far not caused widespread serious side effects, this may not be true for other mRNA vaccines; more research will definitely be needed. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic was such an overwhelming and serious crisis that the international community collaborated in fruitful ways that may not repeat themselves if a future outbreak seems less urgent. There are also logistical factors to take into consideration. The supply chain breakdowns prompted by the pandemic are poised to get worse due to climate change, and experts are already concerned that mRNA vaccines will get destroyed as they are transported because they must be kept in very clean and ultra-cold conditions. It is hard to imagine that the impending supply chain deteriorations won't exacerbate that problem, as will the ongoing disease of misinformation. Since anti-vaccine advocates can alter their baseless beliefs as easily as viruses change their genetic composition, some of this misinformation specifically targets mRNA platforms. One particularly prevalent myth right now is that mRNA vaccines change your DNA, even though (as the above explanation makes clear) this betrays a deep ignorance about how vaccines, viruses, cellular biology and the immune system actually work. Finally, as with all biotechnology, governments and businesses will have to adequately invest. "Despite the promise of mRNA vaccines, we caution that they are far from a silver bullet for future pandemics," Michael J. Hogan and Norbert Pardi write in an Annual Review of Medicine article. "Comprehensive pandemic preparedness requires significant new investments in viral surveillance, proactive clinical testing of vaccines for pandemic-potential viruses, new diagnostic technologies, broad-spectrum antiviral treatments, and stockpiling of materials."

Picture used for representational purpose only BENGALURU: In the absence of Covid vaccination for children, many parents are seeking flu shots for their kids before sending them to school for offline classes. While doctors mandate them for kids with asthma, several children with no such respiratory condition are also opting for the annual influenza vaccination.Flu shot is not covered under the Centreâs universal immunisation scheme and is not available free of cost in government hospitals.It costs Rs 1,500-2,000 per dose, depending on the brand.Dr Archana M, consultant, paediatric infectious diseases, Manipal hospitals, said there have been cases of children with lower respiratory infections turning positive for Influenza B. âMajority of Influenza B cases are treated at home. They are all Covid negative. In some cases, older children have also required hospitalisation and oxygen support, and suffer from secondary bacterial infection. Disease severity and secondary infection can be prevented if the child has taken flu shot,â said Dr Archana.Some corporate hospitals have conducted flu vaccination drives for children in apartment complexes. Manipal hospitals has undertaken one, wherein a registration and declaration form needs to be filled by the parents in advance about the childâs medical history and allergies, if any. A video conference is done with the parents. On the day of vaccination at the apartment complex, the on-site doctor verifies the childâs medical history and the shot is given only if he/she is healthy. So far, 63 children have been administered flu shots by way of drives conducted in apartments.The flu shot has 60-70% efficacy against influenza, but doesnât provide protection from Covid, said Dr Preeti Galagali, a paediatrician. âIt is optional, but suggested for children who suffer from recurrent respiratory tract infections so that it does not lead to complications even if a child has influenza. Since symptoms of both the viral infections (Covid and influenza) are similar, it is suggested. The shot is a must for children with comorbidities,â said Dr Galagali.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories PreviousHow to make easy dump & dine Tofu Salad for dinnerFoodHow to grow Blueberries in home garden or balconyLifestyle9 ways to magically improve your communication skills (without any books)Lifestyle10 most beautiful temples in India perfect for weddingstravel10 delicious dishes made with fresh coconutFoodEasy-to-make Bengali-style Macher Chop (Fish Chops)FoodHow to make one-pot dry-fruit Veg PulaoFood10 reasons to drink anjeer water every morningLifestyle10 baby girl names from Greek and Roman mythologiesLifestyle10 inspiring quotes by Swami Vivekananda that are excellent tips for successLifestyle Next123Hot PicksBengaluru Woman MurderPM Modi US VisitHezbollah Missile AttackSri Lanka CurfewPolar Bear IcelandCristiana Barsony-ArcidiaconoIsrael Raids Al Jazeera OfficeTOP TRENDINGDharavi MosqueKushal GowdaMaharashtra RainIphone 16 SeriesKanpur Railway Track CylinderRandy OrtonNorwegian Rinson JoseShraddha Walkar MurderFilms to Inspire and Motivate StudentsRishabh PantTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteRandy Orton's SmackDown absence reason revealed in his wife's post10 Daily Habits for Students to Keep Their Minds Young and SharpKerala-born Norwegian linked to pager blasts?'Sanctity of Tirupati laddu restored': Temple trust after reports of 'beef fat, fish oil' in 'prasadam'Bengaluru: Computer science student arrested for placing camera in ladies' toiletAirplane makes emergency landing after passenger finds live-mouse in mealFirst time in 92 years!

What is it? by Melissa Suraya Ismail November 22, 2021 Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest stories and updates. Nowadays, when anyone exhibits flu-like symptoms, people panic over the possibility of Covid-19. Yet, when tested, they are not actually Covid-19 positive. So what could it be? Twitter user Dr. Nimelesh reminded all Malaysians that it’s flu season, so we had better get our influenza jab. In Malaysia, influenza seasons are common.Credit: @HauseofHilton / Twitter Currently, people are only getting Covid-19 vaccines, but Dr. Nimalesh suggests also getting your influenza vaccines as they are different viruses and have different ways to be tackled upon. The Influenza Season Influenza is an acute contagious viral respiratory disease characterized by fever, cough, sore throat, headache, myalgia (muscle aches/pain), prostration (fatigue), and coryza (inflammation of the mucous membrane). It can be further categorized into three types, A, B, and C. Influenza A and B viruses cause epidemic disease while the latter usually causes a mild, cold-like illness. In Malaysia, influenza A is more commonly detected than influenza B. Usually, people can mistake a common cold for the flu as the symptoms overlap. In general, the flu is much worse than the common cold as the symptoms of flu are tenser, begin more abruptly, and can further cause serious health problems. (Find out more about the similarities and differences of these here) As a tropical region, flu epidemics happen every year in Malaysia and we do have peaks for when the most cases are detected throughout the year. According to the infographic shared by Dr. Nimalesh on his Twitter thread, influenza infections are very common and the seasonal peaks are around January-March, July-September, and November-December. The peaks are detected in different months throughout the year.Credit: @HauseofHilton / Twitter Those who are at high risk to get complications for these viruses include: Children under 5 years oldPregnant womenElderly people above 65 years oldPeople with chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, etc.People with low immunity either caused by chronic diseases (cancer, HIV, etc) or medications taken (chemotherapy, steroids, etc)Obese individuals Those who are at risk should definitely take these prevention steps. Credit: @HauseofHilton / Twitter What are the steps to avoid influenza? When they exhibit similar symptoms as Covid-19, the ways of prevention are basically the same. Glad we’re all accustomed to these. But still, to reiterate: Get your influenza vaccines offered by most private health facilitiesCover your mouth and nose with a tissue/handkerchief when sneezing or coughingUse facemasks to protect yourselves and othersAlways wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer How to get the Influenza Jab Influenza vaccines should be taken annually as viruses in nature, tend to mutate with time. Hence, that’s why some people deemed it to be unnecessary as they are hesitant to commit. Others might just mistake the symptoms to be a nasty cold and prefer to be treated with a bit of rest and paracetamol instead of spending money on unnecessary jabs. However, ignorance can bring about more complications, at least for those high-risk groups. Especially for children less than 5, they are at high risk of getting the flu and spreading it to other kids at their nursery, daycare, or to their babysitter. They could be mini super flu spreaders for all we know. The influenza vaccine works by priming our immune system. It prepares the antibodies before the real attack begins. You can get yourselves or your loved ones to be vaccinated at your local healthcare clinics. Usually, the vaccines are priced in between RM50-RM100.

Otherwise known as bird flu, counties Galway, Donegal, Kerry and Roscommon have also been affected. A turkey flock in Monaghan has also been struck with the highly pathogenic avian flu. According to the Department of Agriculture. Clinical signs that poultry keepers should look for in their birds include a swollen head, discoloration of neck and throat, loss of appetite, respiratory distress, diarrhoea and fewer eggs laid – although these vary between species of bird. If owners suspect disease in their own flock, they should notify the nearest Regional Veterinary Office or ring the Avian Influenza Helpline: 076 106 4403 (Outside of Office hours: 1850 200 456). If anyone finds dead wild birds such as wild ducks, wild geese, swans, gulls or birds of prey, do not handle the birds. Report the findings to the Department as above. Poultry flock owners are being advised to remain vigilant for any signs of disease in their flocks, maintain strict biosecurity measures and report any disease suspicion to their nearest Department Regional Veterinary Office, even if they only have one or two birds. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has confirmed that although the HPAI H5N1 subtype can cause serious disease in poultry and other birds, no human infections with this virus have been reported in Europe and therefore risk to humans is considered to be very low. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs are safe to eat. An early warning system is in place with Birdwatch Ireland, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the National Association of Regional Game Councils with regard to surveillance for signs of disease in wild birds. The Department continues to closely monitor and assess the disease situation and is in regular contact with industry stakeholders.

Credits: Image - Getty; Video - Newshub This week in 1918, around 9000 people in New Zealand died from the influenza pandemic, compared to 40 deaths so far linked to COVID-19. The 1918 influenza pandemic, also known as the Spanish Flu, was sparked by the spread of the exceptionally deadly H1N1 influenza A virus, which is estimated to have killed 50 million people worldwide near the end of World War I. It was 100 years later when the deadliest respiratory virus pandemic since the Spanish Flu took hold: the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which began in December 2019 and is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. It has so far claimed more than 5 million lives. More from Newshub NZ's 2020 lockdown prevented 32,000 COVID deaths and nearly 2 million infections - study How we beat the virus: A timeline of New Zealand's COVID-19 response Similar to 1918, Māori have been disproportionately affected. Māori make up 43 percent of all COVID-19 cases, despite representing about 15 percent of the population. In 1918, Māori had a death rate more than eight times that for Pākehā. The glaring difference between the two pandemics is vaccination. Less than two years since COVID-19 reached New Zealand, more than 90 percent of the eligible population have had at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Pfizer said on Monday its COVID-19 vaccine provided strong long-term protection against the virus in a late-stage study conducted among adolescents. It said two doses of the vaccine was 100 percent effective against COVID-19, measured seven days through over four months after the second dose. Ministry of Health data released earlier this month showed cases of COVID-19 hospitalisations were almost entirely unvaccinated people. COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins has said the virus is "morphing into a pandemic of the unvaccinated". In 1918, there was no such inoculation available. There were also no antiviral drugs like there are today and no antibiotics to treat the secondary bacterial infections. Therefore, doctors would rely on a random assortment of medicines with varying degrees of effectiveness, from aspirin for pain relief to herbal medicines. "A particularly distressing consequence of infection was that it turned the skin of some of the victims purple-black," NZ History notes. "This was due to pneumonia, which attacked the lungs after the initial infection and was responsible for most of the deaths." There was one method of controlling the virus that translated across the century: lockdowns. According to NZ History, "ordinary life ground to a halt as the pandemic peaked" in 1918, with schools and many workplaces shut to stop the spread of the virus. "Preventative measures included restricting the opening hours of public facilities and postponing or cancelling events that would have brought large numbers of people together - including Auckland's celebration of the armistice with Germany." A newspaper clipping from 1918 showed instructions from the New Plymouth Public Health Committee to volunteer nurses or family attendants dealing with influenza. Like today, patients were ordered to be isolated for 14 days. Mask wearing was also common. Researchers at Auckland University's Te Pūnaha Matatini recently found that had New Zealand not bothered to lock down when COVID-19 arrived on our shores in March 2020, it could have infected a third of the population and killed more than 30,000. One of New Zealand's saving graces was shutting the international border and requiring returnees to spend two weeks in managed isolation facilities (MIQ) - the length of the virus' incubation period. The Delta strain of the virus was transported to New Zealand in August via a traveller from Sydney, around the time when quarantine-free trans-Tasman travel was temporarily permitted. The first known COVID-19 case was a market vendor in the Chinese city of Wuhan, according to a recent study published in the journal Science, and it soon spread via international flights from China. But how the Spanish Flu arrived in New Zealand is unclear. At the time, many believed that the virus had arrived on a ship which birthed in Auckland in October 1918 after sailing from Vancouver via San Francisco, according to NZ History. But historian Geoffrey Rice's analysis of death certificates revealed that peak mortality in New Zealand probably occurred in late November - several weeks later than would have been expected if the vessel had brought the virus, given its incubation period. What is known is that New Zealand brought the virus to Samoa via a cargo ship in November that year, which led to the deaths of between one-fifth and one-quarter of the population. Influenza continues to be a significant public health issue in New Zealand, affecting up to 20 percent of people each year and causing some 500 deaths annually.
