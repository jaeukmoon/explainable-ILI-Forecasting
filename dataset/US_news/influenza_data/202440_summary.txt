Vaccine Recommendations: Everyone aged 6 months and older should receive a flu vaccine every season, with rare exceptions. Vaccination is especially important for individuals at higher risk of severe complications from the flu.

Types of Flu Vaccines: There are various flu vaccines available, including injectable flu vaccines (flu shots) that contain inactivated influenza viruses, a flu shot made without influenza viruses, and a live attenuated influenza vaccine that is administered by nasal spray.

Importance of Early Vaccination: It takes approximately two weeks for the antibodies that protect against the flu to develop after vaccination. Therefore, it is recommended to get vaccinated before the flu season starts for optimal protection.

Vaccine Recommendations Based on Age: The type of flu vaccine recommended varies depending on a person's age and other characteristics. Standard-dose inactivated flu vaccines are approved for individuals as young as 6 months old. Certain vaccines are only approved for adults, while others are preferentially recommended for individuals aged 65 and older.

Availability of Nasal Spray Flu Vaccine: The nasal spray flu vaccine is an option for individuals aged 2 through 49, although it is not recommended for some groups, such as pregnant women and individuals with certain medical conditions.

Overall Benefits of Flu Vaccination: Flu vaccination can significantly reduce flu illnesses, doctors' visits, missed work and school, and flu-related hospitalizations and deaths. It can also make flu symptoms less severe in those who still get sick despite vaccination.

CDC’s Vaccine Coverage Reports: The CDC provides data on flu vaccination coverage each season. The coverage rates have increased overall, but certain groups, such as children of specific racial/ethnic backgrounds and adults with chronic conditions, still have lower vaccination rates.

Misconception about Aspirin and Flu Origins: During the 1918 flu pandemic, a myth emerged that the flu was linked to the use of aspirin produced by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer. However, studies suggest that high dosages of aspirin prescribed at the time may have worsened flu symptoms, but not due to intentional tampering.

Misinformation and Conspiracy Theories: Similar to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the 1918 flu pandemic also saw the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories, including claims of biological warfare and the idea that the flu originated from specific countries.

Lessons from Historical Patterns: Comparing different flu seasons, including the 1918 flu and COVID-19, provides insights into how global events, vaccine availability, and public compliance with health measures can affect the spread of the flu and other respiratory illnesses.

Antibiotic Misuse: Misconceptions surrounding the use of antibiotics for flu treatment can complicate recovery and increase the risk of complications. Awareness of the appropriate treatment for viral infections, such as the flu, is crucial in managing healthcare burden.

Addressing Misinformation: Dispelling myths and addressing misinformation is vital in building public trust and encouraging adherence to preventive health measures, ultimately contributing to effective management and prediction of future ILI occurrences.
