Compared to conventional approaches, this vaccine modality promises comparable potency while substantially accelerating the pace of development and deployment of vaccine doses. Already demonstrated successfully for single antigen vaccines such as for COVID-19, this technology could be optimized for complex multi-antigen vaccines. Herein, utilizing multiple influenza antigens, we demonstrated the suitability of the mRNA therapeutic (MRT) platform for such applications. Seasonal influenza vaccines have three or four hemagglutinin (HA) antigens of different viral subtypes. In addition, influenza neuraminidase (NA), a tetrameric membrane protein, is identified as an antigen that has been linked to protective immunity against severe viral disease. We detail the efforts in optimizing formulations of influenza candidates that use unmodified mRNA encoding full-length HA or full-length NA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). HA and NA mRNA-LNP formulations, either as monovalent or as multivalent vaccines, induced strong functional antibody and cellular responses in non-human primates and such antigen-specific antibody responses were associated with protective efficacy against viral challenge in mice.

In vitro transcribed mRNA packaged in LNPs can produce complex antigens in vivo, via engagement of endogenous ribosomal machinery, with proper post-translational modifications including assembly, glycosylation and trafficking resembling the native antigens. This vaccination modality conveys the advantages of live attenuated vaccines by inducing adaptive immune responses of both humoral and T cell-mediated immunity9. Unlike DNA vaccines, mRNA incurs minimal risk of host genome integration10. The unprecedented rapid development and approval of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines under Emergency Use Authorization, and the growing safety database in millions of human populations, support the exploration of the mRNA platform to address both global pandemic and seasonal viral pathogens.Seasonal influenza virus A and B, with nearly 3–5 million annual cases and 0.29–0.65 million deaths worldwide, are global public health hazards11. Current seasonal influenza vaccines include two influenza A subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) and two influenza B lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) as selected bi-annually by the World Health Organization. In addition, new zoonotic sources of influenza virus including those of avian and swine origins pose pandemic concerns highlighted by avian flu in southeast Asia in 2005, and global H1N1 swine flu in 200912. Several subtypes of seasonal virus occur in nature with frequent mutation and reassortment resulting in antigen drift and shift. Mutations in the HA protein leads to the emergence of new viral variants, that may no longer be neutralized by antibodies to the seasonal HA protein in the vaccine, requiring seasonal updating of the vaccine to cover the most relevant circulating strains13,14.A majority of currently marketed influenza vaccines are produced in eggs, a process that is not only vulnerable to disruptions in the egg supply, as reported in past avian influenza outbreaks15, but also results in egg-adaptation which may result in adaptive mutations in HA leading to diminished vaccine effectiveness16. A key challenge in the vaccine virus selection is that certain strains of influenza virus appear very late in the season after manufacturers have already started growing the vaccine virus17. An mRNA platform with reduced time to market not only allows time for more data collection prior to strain selection but would also eliminate the issues of egg dependence and host adaptation. Furthermore, an mRNA platform offers a generic manufacturing schema with the possibility to adapt to in silico designs that promise increased vaccine breadth and effectiveness18.Although the mRNA technology has been used to study monovalent influenza HA antigens of seasonal or pandemic strains19,20,21,22,23, there is limited data, to our knowledge, on multivalent combinations of antigens. Here, we optimized the MRT platform for multivalent antigen combinations and demonstrate the utility in development of multivalent mRNA vaccines for seasonal or pandemic influenza. A panel of unmodified mRNAs including A/California/07/2009 influenza virus H1 HA (Cal09 HA), A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016 Influenza virus H3 HA (Sing16 HA), A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016 Influenza virus N2 NA (Sing16 NA), A/Michigan/45/2015 Influenza virus N1 NA (Mich15 NA), A/Perth/16/2009 Influenza virus N2 NA (Perth09 NA), and reporter antigens of Firefly luciferase (FF) and human erythropoietin (hEPO) were prepared. LNP formulations for HA and NA mRNA-LNP preparation were then tested for in vitro expression in vivo immunogenicity and potency in preclinical models.ResultsmRNA antigen preparation, characterization, and expressionmRNAs coding for the full-length codon-optimized HA and NA for the various influenza strains were synthesized enzymatically using unmodified ribonucleotides. All mRNA preparations had > 95% of 5′ Cap1 and showed a single homogenous peak on capillary electrophoresis (Supplementary Fig. 1a). mRNA-LNP formulations were prepared by mixing the various lipid components with mRNA under controlled conditions and at fixed ratios. All mRNA-LNPs exhibited >95% encapsulation with uniform hydrodynamic radius ranging from 95 to 105 nm and a poly dispersity index (PDI) of 0.060–0.136 (Supplementary Table 1). Cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) of the Cal09 HA mRNA-LNP images showed uniform spherical particles with a multi-lamellar inner core structure. (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The lamellarity of the solid core structure analyzed further with Fourier Transform, indicated a 3.7 nm periodicity between layers. The uniform morphology of the particles seen in the micrographs are indicative of homogenous LNP preparations with proper assembly.To confirm antigen expression, HEK293FT cells were transfected with unencapsulated mRNA constructs of Cal09 HA, Sing16 HA, Sing16 NA, or Mich15 NA, and the expression of protein was confirmed by western blot. HA monomer of 75 kDa and NA monomer 60 kDa were identified under the reducing and denaturing condition (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Antigen expression was also confirmed with flow cytometry by transiently transfecting human skeletal muscle cells (HskMCs) with the unencapsulated mRNA constructs of Cal09 HA, Sing16 HA, Sing16 NA, or Mich15 NA, and stained with protein-specific antibodies for analysis. High levels of HA and NA expression from HskMCs were observed, confirming proper assembly and trafficking of native form HA and NA upon expression in muscle cells (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 2). To study the subcellular localization of expressed HA and NA proteins, HeLa cells were transfected with bivalent H3N2 LNP and proteins were visualized by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. While the NA signal indicated strong colocalization in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (~90%), HA was found to colocalize moderately with ER when permeabilized cells were stained with antibodies for corresponding proteins and Calnexin, an ER marker (Fig. 1b). This is consistent with the understanding that nascent NA and HA proteins are translocated to the ER for assembly24.Fig. 1: In vitro expression and localization of HA and NA in HskMC and HeLa cells transformed with mRNA.a Frequency of HA and NA expressing human skeletal muscle cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. HskMC cells were transfected with mRNA coding for Cal09 HA, Sing16 HA, Mich15 NA and Sing16 NA. Corresponding antigen expression was confirmed by intracellular staining with each antigen specific mouse or rabbit antibodies followed by fluorochrome conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. The numbers represent the frequency of antigen expression as determined by comparison with mock transfected HskMCs. For gating strategy see Supplementary Fig. 2. b Intracellular localization of expressed HA and NA in HeLa cells. HA and NA protein expression for a bivalent H3N2-mRNA LNP analyzed along with Calnexin an endoplasmic reticulum marker. Image panels show merged image of HA and ER (upper) or NA and ER (lower) antibody staining. Middle two images display separate HA and NA antibody staining (green) and ER marker Calnexin (red). Images in the analysis layer column display results of image analysis to measure colocalization of HA or NA with ER marker. Images contain image analysis mask layers to denote regions of HA or NA colocalization with ER (yellow), HA or NA not colocalized with the ER (green), and ER not containing any HA or NA expression (red).Full size imageThe efficiency of delivery of mRNA by LNPs and selection of optimal formulation parameters was evaluated using reporter mRNA expression25. A single dose of either 0.05, 0.1, 1, or 5 μg of unmodified FF-LNP formulations was administered intramuscularly (IM) in mice. Luciferase activity, measured by average bioluminescence, indicated sustained expression from the mRNA construct which peaked at 6 h post injection and was detectable beyond 72 h at all doses (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). The high-level mRNA-mediated protein expression was further verified with hEPO at a single 0.1 μg dose in mice and 10 μg in non-human primate (NHP). The study was intended to compare LNP, using standard LNP Dlin-MC3-DMA26 formulation as a control. Serum hEPO quantified by ELISA demonstrated maximum expression at 6 h with ~12-fold higher erythropoietin expressed with hEPO-LNP compared to hEPO-MC3 (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Both hEPO-LNP and hEPO-MC3 showed similar expression kinetics in NHPs, detectable from 6 h to 72 h (Supplementary Fig. 3d). The results confirmed the efficient delivery of mRNA by the MRT LNP formulation in both in vitro and in vivo models.Immunogenicity of HA (H1, H3) and NA (N1, N2) mRNA-LNP in miceNatural history and vaccine studies have shown that antibodies to influenza HA and NA have antiviral function and both antigens are considered important for effective influenza vaccines14. Unmodified Cal09 HA-LNP and Sing16 HA-LNP mRNA vaccines were evaluated in BALB/c mice (n = 8) in a two-dose regimen at 2, 0.4, 0.08, or 0.016 μg mRNA-LNP administered at 4-week apart schedule. Recombinant HA (rHA) antigens of the same strain were used to evaluate the total IgG responses in ELISAs. HA-specific antibodies were detected in all groups after a single dose, but the titers peaked at day 42 after the second dose (Supplementary Fig. 4). To measure functional antibodies, hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) response was evaluated against the homologous strains, A/California/07/2009 H1N1 and A/Singapore/ INFIMH160019/2016 H3N2. Although the HAI titers after a first dose could be observed for the 2 μg dose of Cal09-LNP and Sing16-LNP treatment groups with Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of 160 and 70 at day 28 respectively, a more profound increase in HAI titers was observed after the second dose. At day 42, GMT titers were 80 and 2,200 for the 0.016 μg and 0.4 μg groups, respectively, in the Cal09 -HA-LNP and 14 and 100 for the 0.016 μg and 0.4 μg groups, respectively, in the Sing 16 HA-LNP groups (Fig. 2a, b).Fig. 2: Serological Evaluation of HA mRNA-LNP vaccine in mice.BALB/c mice (n = 8 per group) were immunized twice IM, 4 weeks apart with 2, 0.4, 0.08 and 0.016 μg of either Cal09 HA mRNA-LNP or Sing16 HA mRNA-LNP. Log10 HAI titers recorded against (a) A/California/07/2009 H1N1 influenza virus (b) A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016 H3N2 influenza virus shown. Each dot represents an individual animal, and the line represents the geometric mean for the group. Lower horizontal line in each panel represents the lower limit of assay read out. See Supplementary Fig. 4 for ELISA titers.Full size imageSimilarly, for testing anti-NA responses, mice were immunized with 2, 0.4, 0.08, or 0.016 μg of Sing16 NA-LNP or Mich15 NA-LNP. ELISA with recombinant NA (rNA) antigens were conducted to assess the total IgG responses induced by either Mich15 NA-LNP or Sing16 NA-LNP formulations. Animals developed high antibody binding responses after a single dose, with a marked increase in NA binding antibodies post second dose at day 42 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) was used as a surrogate for functional antibody titers for Neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) activity against H6N1 or H6N2 chimeric viruses. Although two doses of the vaccine substantially increased the functional antibody response as compared to a single dose, encouraging NAI titers with GMTs 800 and GMT 60 were recorded at day 28 after a single dose even with low dose of 0.016 μg of Mich15 NA-LNP and Sing16 NA-LNP, respectively. At day 42, the GMT titers for 0.4 μg and 0.016 μg, were 10,200 and 900 respectively in the Sing16 NA-LNP group indicating a dose-dependent response with titers reaching above upper limit of detection (ULOQ = 10,240) in the case of Mich15 NA-LNP (Fig. 3a, b).Fig. 3: Serological Evaluation of NA mRNA-LNP vaccine in mice.BALB/c mice (n = 8 per group) were immunized twice IM 4 weeks apart with 2, 0.4, 0.08, and 0.016 μg of either Mich15 NA mRNA-LNP or Sing16 NA mRNA-LNP. Log10 NAI (ELLA) titers recorded for sera against (a) A/Michigan/45/2015 (N1): A/Mallard/Sweden/2002 (H6) chimeric influenza virus, b A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016 (N2): A/Mallard/Sweden/2002 (H6) chimeric virus are depicted. Each dot represents an individual animal, and the line represents the geometric mean for the group. Lower horizontal line in each panel represents the lower limit of assay read out. See Supplementary Fig. 5 for ELISA titers.Full size imageProtection from viral challenge in miceTo test the efficacy of the mRNA vaccines in a mouse influenza virus challenge model, we inoculated BALB/c mice with 0.4 μg of Cal09 HA-LNP IM at week 0 and 4, along with a negative control group with two doses of LNP diluent buffer. HAI titers for vaccine group serum samples collected at study days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 92, and 107 demonstrated robust immune response with GMT of 1,660 and 830 at day 56 and day 92, respectively (Fig. 4a). At day 93, all mice were challenged intranasally with A/Belgium/145-MA/2009 H1N1 virus, homologous to A/California/07/2009, at four times the dose which can cause 50% lethal outcome (4xLD50). All mice in the vaccine group survived the challenge with no mortality, and some mild morbidity marked by transient weight loss of less than 5% (Fig. 4b). However, mice in the diluent control group suffered significant and rapid weight loss which led to high mortality rate (90%) by day 9. These results demonstrated high efficacy of HA-based MRT formulations in a lethal mouse influenza challenge model.Fig. 4: Protective efficacy of Cal09 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine in mice after lethal A/Belgium/2009 H1N1 virus challenge.Mice (n = 8) received two IM doses of Cal09 HA mRNA-LNP (0.4 μg each) on day 0 and day 28. Control animals received two IM doses of diluent on day 0 and day 28. a HAI titers are reported as Log10 for serum samples taken at study days -7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 92, 107 are reported. Each dot represents an individual animal, and the line represents the geometric mean for the group. Lower horizontal line represents the lower limit of assay read out. b Daily weights after intranasal challenge with 4LD50 of A/Belgium/2009 H1N1 strain on day 93 are reported. Weights are presented as the percentage of weight lost from the day of challenge. Individual lines represent each animal. c Immunization and challenge schedules are provided.Full size imageTo assess the protective efficacy of NA-based MRT vaccines, we conducted an analogous challenge experiment in BALB/c mice. Since the Mich15 NA-LNP vaccine elicited robust NAI titers after a single immunization in naive mice, one and two dosing regimens with administrations of 0.4 or 0.016 μg of Mich15 NA-LNPs over a 4-week interval were evaluated. The control groups were vaccinated at the same regimens, receiving either 0.6 μg hEPO-LNP or diluent buffer. Robust NAI titers were observed after a single administration with GMTs of 14,000 NAI for 0.4 μg and 1,800 NAI for 0.016 μg of Mich15 NA-LNP recorded at day 28 (Fig. 5a). After the second immunization at day 42, NAI titers rose to 108,000 NAI for 0.4 μg and 37,000 NAI for 0.016 μg groups. After about 9-12 weeks post-vaccination regimens, all groups were challenged with 4xLD50 of A/Belgium/145-MA/2009 H1N1 virus. Individual weight changes from baseline over time by treatment groups are graphed in Fig. 5b. All mice in the two control groups suffered significant morbidity, and all animals had to be euthanized due to >20% weight loss by day 8 post-infection. Notably, all animals except one in the vaccine groups survived the challenge in the single dose 0.016 μg group, indicating high protective efficacy against death even after a single dose of as low as 0.016 μg of Mich15 NA-LNP. The higher dose (0.4 µg) demonstrated overall higher protection, however, in contrast to HA-immunization, NA vaccination was not sufficient to protect against weight loss as vaccinated animals demonstrated median weight loss of 10 % of initial body weight. This is rather consistent with observations reported for other NA vaccines that while HA specific antibodies prevent infection by blocking the HA-mediated attachment to the cell surface the NA-specific antibodies limit vial load by blocking the exit of virions leading to reduction of clinical symptoms but not necessarily preventing infection27. Body weight recoveries were observed for vaccinated groups resulting in an average final weight change of 2.7% at the low dose and 4.8% weight gain for the higher dose, as compared to baseline. Overall, the results demonstrated that a single low-dose MRT NA-LNP vaccination can elicit functional antibodies measurable for blocking influenza NA activity and sufficient to confer protection against lethal challenge in mice.Fig. 5: Protective efficacy single dose of unmodified Mich15 NA mRNA-LNP in mice after lethal A/Belgium/2009 H1N1 virus challenge.Mice (n = 16) were injected by the IM route with 0.4 μg or 0.016 μg of A/Michigan/45/2015 NA mRNA-LNP. Half of the mice only received one injection (1 dose) on study day 0, while the other half (2 doses) received two injections given at study day 0 and day 28. Control animals received two IM doses of diluent or hEPO mRNA-LNP (0.6 μg) on day 0 and day 28. a NAI titers are reported as Log10 for serum samples taken at study days -1, 14, 28, 42, 88, 102 for one dose group; -1, 14, 28, 42, 114 for 2 dose group and -1, 14, 28, 42 for control group. Each dot represents an individual animal, and the line represents the geometric mean for the group. Lower horizontal line represents the lower limit of assay read out, b daily weight change after intranasal challenge on day 89 for single dose group and day 117 (89 days after second dose) for two dose group with 4LD50 of Belgium09 H1N1 are reported. Weights are presented as the percentage of weight lost from the day of challenge. Individual lines represent each animal. c Immunization and challenge schedules are provided.Full size imageImmunogenicity of HA (H3) mRNA-LNP in NHPTo evaluate immunogenicity of the mRNA-LNP in NHP, a dose range study covering 15, 45, 135, and 250 μg of Sing16 HA-LNP was performed in NHPs. After the first immunization, all vaccinated NHPs developed antibodies reactive to recombinant HA protein as noted in ELISA (Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 2). Further boosting of titers was observed post second dose in all groups except the 250 μg group. From day 14 to day 42 a statistically significant dose effect between the four doses was observed, however, this was not the case for day 56. A pair wise dose by dose comparison interestingly indicated that the 15 μg dose induced only 1.8-fold lower ELISA titers than the 135 μg dose level (95% CI 1.0, 3.6), suggesting a dose saturation close to 15 μg level. Analysis of the HAI responder groups showed a significant boost effect between day 28 and day 42 in all dose groups but no statistically significant differences between the various dose levels on day 14, 42, and 56. Robust HAI antibodies were induced in all dose groups on day 42 and GMTs recorded were 400 for 15 μg, 700 for 45 μg, 900 for 135 μg and 570 for 250 μg. At day 42, the fold increase in GMT titers with 95% CI was 2.2-fold (1.0; 5.0) between the 135 μg and 15 μg and was 1.3-fold (0.6; 2.8) between the 135 μg and 45 μg treatment groups indicating that despite the observed trend towards higher titers with increasing dose, the difference between groups was minimal (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Table 2). The neutralization potency assessed by microneutralization (MN) assay indicated a significant boost effect between day 28 and day 42 (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Table 2) showing a better trend for dose response with GMTs on day 42 of 570 for 15 µg, 1,016 for 45 µg, 1,280 for 135 µg and 905 for 250 µg.Fig. 6: Serological Evaluation of HA Sing16 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine in NHP.Cynomolgus macaques (n = 6 per group) were injected twice, 4 weeks apart by IM route, with 15, 45, 135, or 250 μg of Sing16 HA mRNA-LNP. Serum samples were collected at days -6, 14, 28, 42, and 56. (a) Log 10 HAI titers against A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016 virus and (b) Log 10 micro neutralization (MN) titers against A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016 virus are shown. Each dot represents an individual animal, and the line represents the geometric mean for the group. Lower horizontal line represents the lower limit of assay read out. See Supplementary Fig. 6 for ELISA titers against recombinant Sing16 HA protein and Supplementary Table 2 for statistical analysis.Full size imageSince T cells have been shown effective in reducing viral load and limiting disease severity in animal models,28,29 we evaluated recall T cells in the NHPs vaccinated with 45, 135, 250 μg of Sing16 HA-LNP or with 45 μg of rHA protein. Primary Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) collected at day 42 were evaluated in IFN-γ (Th1 cytokine) and IL-13 (Th2 cytokine) ELISPOT assay with recall stimulation with pooled overlapping peptides spanning the entire sequence of the Sing16 HA protein. All vaccinated animals except one in 250 μg group developed IFN-γ secreting cells, ranging from 28 to 1,328 spot-forming cells (SFC) per million PBMCs (Fig. 7a). Notably, a dose–response was not observed, and the lower and higher dose level groups of animals showed comparable frequencies of IFN-γ secreting cells. In contrast, all animals in the control group immunized with the recombinant Sing16 HA protein demonstrated the absence of IFN-γ producing cells. The presence of IL-13 cytokine secreting cells were either not detected or very low in all the groups tested (Fig. 7b). The data suggest that Sing16 HA-LNP induced strong Th1-biased cellular responses in NHPs, comparable to that seen with MRT550030, the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, currently under development.Fig. 7: T cell responses in NHP vaccinated with Sing16 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine.Cynomolgus macaques (n = 6 per group) were injected twice, 4 weeks apart by IM route, with 45, 135, or 250 μg of Sing16 HA mRNA-LNP. T cells were determined by ELISPOT on day 42 in PBMC stimulated in vitro with peptide pools to represent the entire HA open reading frame. The responses of PBMC secreting IFNɣ (a) or IL-13 (b) calculated as spots forming cells (SFC) per million PBMC are shown. Each symbol represents an individual sample, and the bar represents the mean with standard deviation for the group.Full size imageTo investigate frequency of memory B cells (MBCs) in NHPs after immunization with Sing16 HA-LNP, an ELISPOT assay was developed to quantify antigen-specific MBCs as a readout of humoral immune memory. On day 180, PBMCs were collected from the NHPs immunized with 45 μg or 15 μg of the Sing16 HA mRNA-LNP formulations or with a recombinant HA as a comparator at a 45 μg dose. A 4-day polyclonal stimulation of PBMCs that is optimized to drive memory B cells to antibody secreting cells (ASC), and the stimulated PBMCs were plated in an antigen-specific ELISPOT where the frequency of antigen-specific ASCs could be determined. Antigen-specific memory B cells were then quantified as a percentage of total IgG+ memory B cells. Antigen-specific memory B cells were detected in all animals and their frequency ranged from 1 to 5% for the 45 ug dose group and 0.3 to 1.5% for the 15 μg dose group (Supplementary Table 3). In the rHA immunized animals, the memory B cell responses appeared to be markedly lower as antigen-specific memory B cells were undetectable in five out of six animals (Fig. 8) indicating that Sing16 HA-LNP like other mRNA vaccines elicits antigen specific memory B cells responses that promise to prolong immunity31.Fig. 8: Secretion of A/Singapore/16/H3-specific IgG by memory B cells on day 180 in NHP vaccinated with Sing16 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine.Cynomolgus macaques (n = 6 per group) were injected twice, 4 weeks apart by IM route, with 15 or 45 μg of Sing16 HA mRNA-LNP. The Human IgG Single-Color memory B cell ELISPOT kit (CAT# NC1911372, CTL) was used to measure A/Singapore/16/H3-specific and total IgG+ antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Differentiation of MBCs into ASCs was performed in PBMC collected at day 180 by using a stimulation cocktail provided by the kit. The number of IgG+ and number of A/Singapore/16/H3-specific ASCs was calculated per million of PBMCs for each animal and the frequency of antigen-specific ASCs is shown. Each symbol represents an individual sample, and the bar represents the mean with standard deviation for the group. The percentage of antigen-specific ASCs to the total IgG+ ASCs is shown in Supplementary Table 3.Full size imageMultivalent influenza virus antigensOne of the advantages of the mRNA-LNP platform is the flexibility of LNP encapsulation for multiple mRNA antigen constructs. However, this potential needs to be tested to address the concern of antigenic interference. To explore combinations of influenza antigens, co-encapsulated HA and NA bivalent mRNA LNPs containing 0.2 μg each of mRNA in a H3H1, H3N2, or N1N2 combination were tested alongside monovalent LNP containing 0.2 μg of corresponding each antigen (Supplementary Table 4). These formulations were administered in mice to determine any antigenic interference on immunogenicity by comparing the functional titers of the individual antigen in bivalent vs. monovalent formulations (Fig. 9a–c, Supplementary Table 5). In the H1H3 combo, no statistical difference (p = 0.2584) for H1 HAI titers was seen between the co-encapsulated and separately administered formulations irrespective of the time points and no significant difference (p = 0.8389) at day 42 was seen for H3 titers. In the case of H3N2 combo, the NA component of the vaccine elicited high neutralizing antibodies in combination with the HA component demonstrating lack of HA dominance. Between the co-encapsulated and separately administered vaccines no statistically significant difference (p = 0.2960) irrespective of the time points was seen for H3 HAI titers, and no significant difference (p = 0.0904) at day 42 was seen for N2 NAI titers. Likewise, the N1N2 combo was not statistically different (p = 0.3899) for N2 NAI titers. N1 NAI titers at day 42 for co-encapsulated vaccine were higher (p = 0.0291) than the separately administered vaccines. In summary, bivalent combinations of N2N1, H3H1, or H3N2 generated antibody titers equivalent to individual separately formulated LNPs.Fig. 9: Delivery of bivalent combinations of influenza vaccine in mice.BALB/c mice (n = 8 per group) were immunized twice IM, 4 weeks apart with a total 0.4 μg of bivalent combinations co-encapsulated mRNA transcripts (1:1 wt/wt, half volume per each leg) or 0.2 μg each monovalent which was separately formulated and immunized different legs. H1H3 combo constituting Cal09 HA mRNA-LNP, Sing16 HA mRNA-LNP; H3N2 combo of Sing16 HA mRNA-LNP and Perth09 mRNA-LNP and N1N2 combo of Mich15 NA mRNA-LNP and Perth09 NA mRNA-LNP were tested in sera collected a day -2, 14, 28, 42, against corresponding virus. Control treatments included diluent or bivalent co-encapsulated formulations of corresponding HA or NA mRNA with non-coding mRNA. a HAI titers recorded against A/California/07/2009 H1N1 influenza virus and A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016 H3N2; b HAI and NAI titers recorded against A/Singapore/INFIMH160019/2016 H3N2 and A/Mallard/Sweden/2002 (H6) chimeric influenza virus and H6N2 A/Perth/09 virus (N2) virus, respectively (c).

See Supplementary Table 4 for design of study and Supplementary Table 5 for statistical analysis.Full size imageWe further explored quadrivalent formulations of co-encapsulated H1, N1, H3, and N2 mRNA. These formulations were tested in NHPs with a total of 10 μg mRNA composed of 2.5 μg of each influenza antigen mRNA and or filling with a corresponding amount of noncoding mRNA (nc mRNA) resulting in quadrivalent (H1N1H3N2), bivalent (H1N1 or H3N2), or monovalent (H1, H3, N1, or N2) LNPs (Supplementary Table 6). HAI titers to H1 or H3, or NAI titers to N1 or N2 were compared between the monovalent formulations vs. bivalent or quadrivalent formulations (Fig. 10, Supplementary Table 7). On day 42, the HAI titers to H1 of the quadrivalent group were comparable when analyzed with that of the H1 monovalent group (p = 0.9054, t-test, unpaired, two-tailed) or H1N1 bivalent group (p = 0.8002). Similarly, the H3 HAI titers of the quadrivalent group was comparable when analyzed with that of the H3 monovalent group (p = 0.2504) or H3N2 bivalent group (p = 0.5894). The NAI titers to N1 were almost identical in groups of animals vaccinated with N1 monovalent mRNA or H1N1 bivalent mRNA or the quadrivalent H1N1H3N2 mRNA formulations. Likewise, there was no difference in N2 NAI titers between the N2 monovalent mRNA (p = 0.8485) or H3N2 bivalent mRNA (0.4545) with the quadrivalent H1N1H3N2 mRNA formulations. Overall, these findings indicate that co-encapsulated and combined multivalent vaccines of HA/NA mRNA-LNPs could efficiently deliver all four antigens without any sign of immunological interference and all antigens were as immunogenic as in the formulation when these antigens were delivered singularly.Fig. 10: Delivery of quadrivalent combinations of influenza vaccines in NHP.Cynomolgus macaques (n = 6 per group) were immunized twice IM, 4 weeks apart with a total 10 μg of quadrivalent combinations of co-encapsulated mRNA transcripts (1:1:1:1 wt/wt).

See Supplementary Table 6 for design of study and Supplementary Table 7 for statistical analysis.Full size imageDiscussionSeveral advancements in the design of mRNA have led to improvements in its translatability, stability, and immunomodulatory activities32,33,34. To express antigen efficiently, mRNA requires (i) careful selection of 5′ and 3′ UTRs responsible for recruiting RNA binding proteins; (ii) codon optimization algorithms to include synonymous and more frequent codons to replace rare codons for protein sequences; and (iii) modification of the 5′ cap to reduce the innate immune responses. The immunomodulatory profile of mRNA is influenced by (i) the purity of in vitro transcribed mRNA and particularly the content of dsRNA35 and/or (ii) introduction of modified nucleosides in the mRNA36,37. Contrary to the belief that innate immune sensing of unmodified mRNA could lead to inhibition of antigen expression and negatively affect the immune responses, we observed sustained production of protein comparable to modified RNA21 emphasizing the importance of purity and rational designs of RNA structure/sequence, in determining potency and performance of the vaccine38. With respect to LNP delivery systems, optimized molar ratios of the lipid components composed of (i) an ionizable lipid with cationic charge facilitating encapsulation of the mRNA and driving the dynamics of endosomal release; (ii) a zwitterionic lipid that aids membrane fusion; (iii) cholesterol as a stabilizer; and (iv) a PEG lipid aiding in protection and stability of the LNP were used to ensure enhanced cellular uptake and endosome escape39,40. Cryo-TEM images of the Cal09 HA-LNP showed uniform spherical particle structure, indicating that the LNP formulation is homogenous. The findings are consistent with morphology of mRNA-LNPs that have been reported previously41. The MRT platform provides an advanced technology that incorporates the elements of design for both the mRNA component and the delivery system making it suitable to develop vaccine candidates against a broad range of disease targets.mRNA vaccines have been shown to induce strong and potent humoral and T cell responses against several infectious disease targets including SARS-COV-242,43 cytomegalovirus44, zika virus45, respiratory syncytial virus46, human metapneumovirus47 as well as influenza virus19. The current standard of care for a seasonal influenza vaccine is a quadrivalent vaccine containing H3, H1, and B influenza strain antigens as selected by the WHO. We evaluated two model antigens: HA, the surface glycoprotein and the main target in current vaccines driving induction of neutralizing antibodies; and NA, a less abundant viral surface glycoprotein, antibodies to which are known to inhibit viral replication. We demonstrated here that HA and NA mRNA-LNPs, can generate robust and protective immune responses in mice. Several studies have previously reported anti-HA responses to mRNA vaccines in mice48,49. In our study, a single 2 μg dose of Cal09 HA-LNP resulted in GMT of 160 in mice, consistent with observations that a 3 μg dose of FPLC-purified full length Cal09 HA-encoding mRNA encapsulated in LNP resulted in >120 HAI titers and offered protection upon challenge19. Although we tested protection mediated by HA response after 2 immunizations of a Cal09 HA-LNP, an important outcome of our study is the finding that a single 16 nanogram dose of a Mich15 NA-LNP could provide a robust functional antibody response and protection from lethal challenge. Similar observations of protective low doses of NA mRNA in mice have been reported in a recent study50.NA functions as an enzymatic protein which cleaves terminal sialic acid from glycans and helps the virus to penetrate the mucosal fluid to reach its target cells and also permits newly made budding viruses to release from the cell to then infect nearby cells, thus playing a crucial role in viral lifecycle51. It has been long proposed as a target for development of influenza vaccines52. Although current standard dose egg-based inactivated influenza virus vaccines contain low amounts of NA as a result of the production process, it is not quantified and thus a suboptimal dose to induce a robust immune response53. Thus far, there has been limited success to obtain GMP-grade purified or recombinant NA for demonstration of clinical efficacy and the mRNA platform offers an opportunity to provide an improved influenza vaccine formulation that expresses not only an HA protein but also a properly folded NA protein for induction of a robust neutralizing antibody response. Furthermore, mRNA-derived NA overcomes the immunodominance of HA often reported in combined recombinant HA, NA vaccination wherein lower immune responses against NA have been reported54.Dose ranging studies in NHPs confirmed the potency of the Sing16 HA-LNP in eliciting neutralizing antibodies. We observed robust HAI titers, in NHPs, following single IM dose of 15 to 45 μg of Sing16 HA-LNP compared to 200 or 400 μg dose vaccination of H10 or H7 mRNA-MC321. A minimal difference in dose responses in NHPs could be indicative of plausible dose sparing effect of MRT formulations. As all the animals assigned in the study were naive for influenza before immunization, we anticipate that the presence of cross-reactive HA-specific memory B cells and T cells in a clinical setting, with pre-existing HA immunity, will likely result in a stronger boosting response. It is encouraging to see the remarkably higher antigen-specific memory B cells circulating in NHPs 6 months after immunization with Sing16 HA-LNP compared to the subunit vaccine. Ongoing clinical studies with these LNPs will determine if such responses can be induced in humans as well. Spike protein-specific memory B cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals following SARS-COV-2 mRNA vaccination55 and HA-specific memory B cell responses following mRNA influenza vaccination56 have been reported suggesting that mRNA vaccine platforms may have a better ability to induce long lasting B cell memory than a recombinant protein, potentially due to proper presentation of relevant neutralizing epitopes from de novo expressed antigens by mRNA. In addition, Sing16 HA-LNP vaccine induced strong Th1-biased responses in NHPs with antigen specific interferon-γ produced by large portion of HA-specific T cells consistent with the observations with other mRNA vaccines42. As cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in protection against influenza illnesses, hetero-subtypic immunity and in the establishment of memory it would be interesting to additionally assess the role of T cells in mediating broadly protective immunity, amidst reports of heterologous protection observed in recent Influenza mRNA vaccine studies19,50 in the absence of HAI titers.With monovalent mRNA vaccines demonstrating high potency and protection in challenge models, we sought to further test this technology to include multivalent approaches. To this end, we formulated bivalent LNPs and immunized mice as a co-encapsulated vaccine product, as compared to two monovalent formulations dosed as separate injections. Equivalent, robust neutralizing antibody titers were observed regardless of formulation approach. The multivalency testing was expanded further to produce quadrivalent formulations, which were then administered to NHPs for immunization. These were compared to equivalent bivalent and monovalent vaccinations to assess the consistent robustness of the individual antigen immunogenicity. Robust neutralizing antibody titers were generated for all antigens across all conditions, supporting the potential of multivalent influenza vaccines as a viable approach without observations of immunodominance or interference of one antigen over another. Multi-antigen vaccines, if produced using traditional vaccine technologies, would require large manufacturing footprints utilizing antigen-specific operations; whereas an mRNA-based approach utilizes the same unit operations regardless of antigen produced, and therefore requires a much smaller footprint and infrastructure.Our data indicate the suitability of the MRT platform for developing mRNA vaccines to multiple disease targets. We have optimized a generic manufacturing process, demonstrated in vivo expression of multivalent antigens with proper post-translational modifications that are necessary for a fully functional protein and the induction of adaptive responses that elicit both T and B cell immunity. To the best of our knowledge, this is an early report demonstrating the delivery of quadrivalent mRNA transcripts each coding for a distinct trimeric or tetrameric functionally active protein. We show that multiple mRNA transcripts can be packaged and delivered as a combination of two or four antigens with no differences in the magnitude of humoral immune responses compared to antigen delivered as a monovalent. Of particular utility is the ability to encapsulate multiple influenza virus antigens, as commonly envisioned for potential use in an influenza pandemic or a broad-spectrum seasonal vaccine, with improved manufacturing capacity for emergency scale-up.High dose influenza vaccines have been demonstrated to provide protection beyond flu through reduction in hospitalizations due to influenza related cardiovascular events and pneumonia57. We have embarked into a journey to further improve influenza vaccine effectiveness through research and development across five pillars: antigen composition, adjuvants, effector mechanisms, host immunity and clinical design, and manufacturing platforms58. We address the last pillar in this work by building a platform that has a well-controlled scalable process and has shorter lead times allowing for facile applications to other antigens, making it pertinent for pandemic or seasonal viral vaccine production. Recognizing the broader consequences of influenza virus infection such as severity of disease and extent of morbidity and mortality is essential to determine the full burden of influenza59 and underscores the potential impact of the mRNA vaccine technology. Furthermore, the flexibility of the mRNA platform will allow inclusion of other viral targets, such as SARS-COV-2 antigens, should there be a need for such a seasonal vaccine in the future.MethodsEthics statementAll animal experiments were carried out in compliance with all pertinent US national institutes of health regulations and were conducted with approved animal protocols from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at BIOQUAL Inc and New Iberia Research Center, University of Louisiana Lafayette (NIRC). Housing and handling of mice were performed in accordance and compliant with the standards of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC), the Animal Welfare Act as amended, and the Public Health Service Policy. The studies adhered strictly to applicable Standard Operating Procedures of BIOQUAL Inc. Rockville, MD and the approved IACUC protocol. NHP studies were performed at the NIRC. Treatment of NHPs was in accordance with standard operating procedures at NIRCs, which adhere to the regulations outlined in the USDA Animal Welfare Act (9 CFR, Parts 1, 2, and 3) and the conditions specified in The Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (ILAR publication, 1996, National Academy Press.mRNA-LNP preparationsmRNA transcripts encoding for hEPO, FF, Cal09 HA, Sing16 HA, Mich15 NA, and Sing16 NA were synthesized by in vitro transcription employing RNA polymerase with a plasmid DNA template encoding the desired gene using unmodified nucleotides. The resulting purified precursor mRNA was reacted further via enzymatic addition of a 5’ cap structure (Cap 1) and a 3′ poly(A) tail of approximately 200 nucleotides in length as determined by gel electrophoresis and purified. All mRNA preparations were analyzed for purity, integrity, and percentage of cap1 before storage at -20 °C. Preparation of mRNA-LNP formulations were prepared by appropriate mixing solutions of mRNA and lipid mixture. Briefly, an ethanolic solution of a mixture of lipids (ionizable lipid, phosphatidylethanolamine, cholesterol and polyethylene glycol-lipid) at a fixed lipid and mRNA ratio were combined with an aqueous buffered solution of target mRNA at an acidic pH under controlled conditions to yield a suspension of uniform LNPs60. Upon ultrafiltration and diafiltration into a suitable diluent system, the resulting nanoparticle suspensions were diluted to final concentration, filtered, and stored frozen at -80 °C until use. For the multivalent formulations, co-encapsulation was performed by combining the mRNAs at the desired ratios and used as mRNA mix for the formulation process. The total mRNA encapsulated in the LNP was measured by the RiboGreenTM assay and was used to calculate the representation of the different mRNAs used. An assumption was taken that the final ratio of mRNAs in LNP formulations is same as the starting ratios of mRNAs used. mRNA cap % measured using Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC/ 6530 QTOF with MassHunter B.09.00 (Agilent Technologies). The mRNA-LNP formulations were characterized for size, percentage encapsulation and were stored at -80 °C at 1 mg/mL until further use by dilution with suitable buffer. LNP Size, polydispersity measurements were performed on Zetasizer 7.11 (Malvern) and % encapsulation was determined with Ribogreen assay measured using Spectramax M5 with SoftMax Pro 5.4 (Molecular Devices).Western blotHuman embryonic Kidney cells (HEK293FT ThermoFisher Cat# R70007) were cultured in DMEM (Gibco # D6429) contained 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 5 ml NEAA, and 1% G418 at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a 6-well plate. Cells were then transfected with 3 µg of mRNA per well using TransIT®-293 Transfection Reagent (cat MIR 2225, Mirus) at 80% confluency. Twenty-four hours post transfection, cells were harvested and lysed with NP40 cell lysis buffer (cat FNN0021, Invitrogen). Lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted on Nitrocellulose membrane with iBlot (IB30100, Invitrogen), and follow the manual of iBind and reagent (cat SLF1010 and SLF1020, Invitrogen) for western Blot. Cal09 HA protein was detected with anti-Cal09 recombinant HA Mouse polyclonal antibody (1:250 dilution, generated in house) followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution, catalogue number A3562, Sigma). Similarly, Sing16 HA protein was detected with Anti-Sing16 H3 Rabbit polyclonal antibody Ab (1:250 dilution, inhouse reagent) followed by secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:1000 dilution, catalogue number ab97066, Abcam). Mich15 NA protein was detected with rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:250 dilution, catalogue number11058-r001, Sino Biologicals) followed by goat anti-rabbit conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:1000 dilution, ab97066, Abcam). Sing16 NA protein was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:250 dilution, catalogue number 40017-T60, Sino Biologicals) followed by goat anti-rabbit conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:1000 dilution, ab97066, Abcam).Visualization of HA and NA-proteins expressed in HeLa cellsImmunocytochemistry-immunofluorescence analysis of influenza NA and HA-proteins was performed in HeLa cells ATCCⓇ CCL-2™ transfected with bivalent H3N2 (Sing16 HA and Perth09 NA) mRNAs LNPs)30. Glass coverslips were placed in each well of a 12-well plate and coated with 100 μg/mL solution of poly-D-lysine to aid in cell adhesion. HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10e5 cells per well and allowed to grow overnight to achieve ≥80% cell confluency prior to transfection. Mirus TransIT-mRNA Transfection Kit (Mirus, cat# MIR2225) was used to transfect cells with Covid-19 Spike Protein mRNAs. In brief, per one well 1 μg of mRNA was added to 100 μL of Opti-MEM I Reduced-Serum Medium followed by 2 μL of mRNA Boost Reagent and 2 μL of TransIT-mRNA reagent. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min for the complexes to form. These complexes were then added dropwise to different areas of each well containing HeLa cells in 1 mL complete growth medium. Cells were incubated with the complexes for 24 hours (h) to permit expression of mRNAs. After 24 h cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to antibody staining for the HA or NA Proteins and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker. After fixation cells were washed in phosphate buffer (PBS) followed by permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were then incubated for 0.3 h in a blocking solution consisting of 5% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% Bovine Serum Albumin, 50 mM ammonium chloride, 25 mM glycine, and 25 mM lysine in PBS. After washing with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS cells were incubated with primary antibodies against H3 HA (GeneTex GTX40258), NA (anti-Neuraminidase antibody, inhouse reagent), and ER marker Calnexin (Abcam ab22595) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3× in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies. Goat anti-Mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (ThermoFisher cat# A32723) and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 555 (ThermoFisher, cat# A32732) secondary antibodies were used at 4 μg/mL concentrations along with DAPI for visualization of nuclei. After incubation cells were washed 3 times in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Coverslips were then removed from wells and placed on glass slides with a drop of Aqua-Poly/Mount mounting medium (Polysciences, cat# 18606). After sealing the coverslips with nail polish, and images were captured on Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope followed by image analysis for quantification of HA and NA colocalization to the ER, mean signal intensity, and percent of cell area. Image analysis was performed with Visiopharm image analysis software where mask layers were overlayed on HA, NA, and ER immunofluorescent staining based on HA or NA colocalization with ER marker. HA or NA staining which colocalized with the ER were highlighted in yellow and HA or NA staining which did not colocalize with ER were highlighted in green.Flow cytometryHuman skeletal muscle cells (HskMCs, Lonza, Cat #: CC-2561) were cultured in M199 (Life Technologies) supplemented with GlutaMax (Life Technologies), streptomycin, penicillin (Gibco), and 20% heat inactivated FBS (VWR) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with PBS, and electroporated using human primary muscle cell transfection kit on Nucleofector 2b (Lonza) with 12 mg of mRNA per 106 cells following manufacturer’s electroporation program D-033. Post 24 hr harvested cells were fixed, permeabilized with CytoFix/Perm (BD) and stained with Cal09 HA (Immune Tech), Sing16 HA (30-2F11-F7-A5, GeneTex), Mich15 NA (6G6, Immune Tech) and Sing16 NA (40017-RP01, Sino Biologicals) specific Ab followed by PE conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary Ab (Southern Biotech) or AF647 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies). Then the Ab labeled cells were acquired by Fortessa (BD) and the expression of each protein was analyzed by FlowJo 10.6.2 (BD, Ashland, OR). Blots for each antigen were processed in the same experiment and were processed in parallel.Cryogenic transmission electron microscopyA PELCO easiGlow device was used to plasma clean the grids prior to LNP sample application, and a Vitrobot Mark IV System (ThermoFisher) with the chamber held at 100% humidity and 18 °C was used for plunge freezing. A 3.0 µL droplet of LNP sample was dispensed onto 300 mesh R2/1 quantifoil grids with carbon film and gold bars. Grids were blotted for 4 seconds, held in place for 10 s, and then immediately plunge frozen in liquid ethane for storage and transfer to a Krios microscope. Exposures were collected using a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (ThermoFisher) equipped with a BioQuantum energy filter and K3 direct electron detector (Gatan) operating in counting mode. Calibrated physical pixel size at the detector was 1.38 Å, corresponding to ×64,000 magnification. A total of 3141 69-frame movie exposures were collected at a dose per frame of 1.045 e/Å2 with defocus between -0.5 and -1.7 um. For each movie exposure, patch-based motion correction, binning of super-resolution pixels, and frame dose-weighting was performed using RELION-3.1.34. From corrected images, over 700 candidate particle coordinates were extracted. Subsequent data analysis was done with Matlab R2019a with image processing toolbox.Immunization of mice and NHPsFor expression studies groups of four cynomolgus macaques (NHPs) (male and female) and four to eight male BALB/c mice were administered intramuscularly either dose of 10 µg (NHP) or 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05 µg (mice) with hEPO-LNP prepared in the same ratio as the one intended to be used for HA/NA mRNA-LNP formulations. Blood samples depending on the species were taken pre-administration, and at 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, or 96 h post administration to monitor for serum hEPO expression via an ELISA using R and D Systems, Quantikine® IVD® ELISA, Human Erythropoietin Immunoassay kit as per manufacturers protocol. and reported as final values of mIU/mL and ng/mL. Briefly, microplate wells, precoated with a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for EPO were incubated with specimen or standard. After removing excess specimen or standard, wells are incubated with a rabbit anti-EPO polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. During the second incubation, the antibody-enzyme conjugate binds to the immobilized EPO. Excess conjugate is removed by washing. A chromogen is added to the wells and is oxidized by the enzyme reaction to form a blue colored complex. The reaction is stopped by the addition of acid, which turns the blue to yellow. The amount of color generated is directly proportional to the amount of conjugate bound to the EPO antibody complex, which, in turn, is directly proportional to the amount of EPO in the specimen or standard. The absorbance of this complex is measured, and a standard curve is generated by plotting absorbance versus the concentration of the EPO standards. The EPO concentration of the unknown specimen is determined by comparing the optical density of the specimen to the standard curve. The standards used in this assay are recombinant human EPO calibrated against the Second International Reference Preparation (67/343), a urine-derived form of human erythropoietin. FF-LNPs were utilized to check level of expression of target protein in vivo using imaging on IVIS® Lumina LT In Vivo Imaging System with Living image 4.0 (PerkinElmer).For immunogenicity studies groups of 8 female Balb/c mice (Mus musculus) per treatment group were immunized under isoflurane anesthesia with a dose of 0.05 mL of designated vaccine preparation or diluent via the IM route in the quadriceps, on day 0 in one hind leg and day 28 in the contralateral leg. Mice that lost more than 20% of their initial body weight and displayed severe clinical signs were euthanized after the veterinarian’s assessment of the animal’s health prior to the study termination.Naive male and female Mauritius origin Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were selected from the Sanofi NHP colony at New Iberia Research Center. Animals weighed >2 kg and were >2 years of age at the start of the studies. Animals selected for the study underwent comprehensive physical examinations prior to assignment to the study. The pre-assignment assessment of health status included a hands-on veterinarian examination and blood sample collections for CBC analysis as applicable per NIRC SOPs. Animals were generally housed in pairs and acclimated for at least 3 days prior to the start of the study. Groups consisted of up to 6 animals per treatment group. All animals were immunized under ketamine HCl (10 mg/kg, IM) or telazol (4–8 mg/kg, IM) sedation with a dose of 0.5 mL of their respected vaccine preparation or diluent via the IM route in one forelimb of each animal, targeting the deltoid, on Study Day 0. Twenty-eight days after the first immunization took place, a second immunization was given to the animals in the contralateral limb.For challenge studies, mice were inoculated with the challenge strain approximately 9–12 weeks after the last immunization. Vials of stock virus were thawed and diluted to the appropriate concentration in ice-cold sterile PBS. All mice were challenged with a total volume of 50 μL containing 105.54 TCID50 of A/Belgium/145-MA/2009 virus in PBS which equated to 4LD50. Virus challenge was performed inside the biosafety cabinet in an enhanced ABSL2 laboratory. Mice were first anesthetized with an IP injection of a Ketamine/Xylazine solution (50 mg/kg Ketamine and 5 mg/kg Xylazine), and then challenged IN (dropwise into both nostrils; 25 μL per nostril) with a total volume of 50 μL of influenza virus using a micropipette. Following the challenge procedure, mice were placed in dorsal recumbency and observed until recovery from anesthesia. Daily body weights were taken following H1N1 challenge. Any individual animal with a single observation > 20% body weight loss was euthanized. The weight measurements were either recorded daily post challenge until euthanasia in the online database, Pristima® (Version 7.5.0 Build 8), or written on study specific working sheets.Blood collectionBlood was collected from mice via submandibular or orbital sinus bleeds (in-life bleed, pre-study and on study days 14, 28, and 42 approximately 200 μL) and cardiac puncture (terminal bleed, day 56) from all animals under sedation. Mice were bled on pre-study to obtain a base-line pre-immune serum sample and for pre-screening purposes. Processing of the serum, blood samples were collected into SST tubes and allowed to clot for 30 min to 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then centrifuged 1000–1300 g for 5–10 min with brakes off. Serum was collected using a P200 pipettor, divided into two 0.5 mL cryovials, and stored at −20 °C. All bleeds were documented on specimen collection and processing logs, indicating the time of sample collection and the technician responsible for performing the procedure. A portion of the serum samples were evaluated in the HAI or ELLA and ELISA assays for antibody titers.NHPs were bled for serum isolation while under anesthesia administered intramuscularly using10 mg/kg ketamine/1 mg/kg Acepromazine (days -4, 2, 7, 14, 28, 30, 35, 42, 56, 90, 180). The volume of blood withdrawn did not exceed established guidelines with respect to percentage of body weight and animal’s physical condition Blood was withdrawn from anesthetized NHPs using femoral venipuncture using a Vacutainer 21 ga × 1″ blood collection needle or Abbott Butterfly 23 ga x ¾” tubing attached to BD Vacutainer® SST™ gel tubes. Serum was isolated by spinning the tubes at room temperature at a speed of 1200 × g for 10 min. Serum will then be aliquoted into labeled cryovials (1 mL/vial) and stored at ≤ -20 °C. A portion of the serum samples were evaluated in the HAI or ELLA and ELISA assays for antibody titers. For PBMCs, NHPs were pre-bled before vaccination and again approximately 42–63 days after the first injection. For this purpose, blood is collected into BD Vacutainer® tubes containing heparin anticoagulant. Briefly, anticoagulated blood samples are diluted in PBS and subjected to gradient density centrifugation for 30 min at 400 × g using Histopaque separation solution (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). The opaque interface containing mononuclear cells is then collected, washed three times in PBS using a low speed (250 × g) centrifugation to reduce the number of platelets. The live vs. dead PBMC are enumerated using a Nexcelom Cellometer K2. The PBMC are cryopreserved in FBS with 10% DMSO using Mr. Frosty® freezing boxes. The boxes are placed immediately into a -80 °C freezer for 24 h and then transferred for storage in a liquid nitrogen tank.ELISAThe antibody ELISAs were performed using recombinantly produced influenza A H3N2 (Sing16) Neuraminidase (NA) protein, influenza A H3N2 (Sing16) hemagglutinin (HA) protein, or influenza A H1N1 (A/California/07/2009) hemagglutinin (HA) protein. The proteins were captured on 96 well high binding polystyrene plates at a concentration of 2 μg/mL in Carbonate-Bicarbonate Buffer. The plates were covered and incubated overnight (16 ± 4 h) at 2–8 °C. After overnight incubation, the antigen coated plates were washed 5 times with Washing Buffer (PBS 0.5% Tween20) and blocked with Blocking solution (10% BSA in PBS) for 60 ± 30 min at room temperature. Test samples, naive control, and the reference sample were diluted in Sample Diluent (PBS 10% BSA 0.5% Tween 20) and added to wells in duplicates followed by incubation at room temperature for 90 min. Plates were washed 5 times with Washing Buffer, and Goat anti-mouse HRP for mouse sera or Goat anti-monkey HRP for NHP sera was added at a dilution of 1:10,000. The plates were then incubated 30 min at room temperature and the excess HRP-IgG was washed with Washing buffer. Sure-Blue TMB substrate was added to each plate and the reaction was stopped after ~10 min with TMB stop solution. The plates were then read at 450 nm with a Thermo Labsystems Multiskan spectrophotometer. The anti-antigen (HA or NA) specific antibody titers were expressed as a reciprocal of the highest serum dilution with an absorbance value >0.3.HAI assayHAI assays were performed using the A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2) and the A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus stocks from BIOQUAL, Inc. Sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) by diluting one-part serum with three parts enzyme and incubated overnight in a 37 °C water bath. Enzyme was inactivated by a 30-minute incubation period at 56 °C followed by addition of six parts PBS for a final dilution of 1/10. HAI assays were performed in V-bottom 96-well plates using four hemagglutinating units (HAU) of virus and 0.5% turkey RBC. The reference serum for each strain was included as a positive control on every assay plate. Each plate also included a back-titration to confirm the antigen dose (4 HAU/25 μL) as well as a negative control sample (PBS or naive control serum). The HAI titer was determined as the highest dilution of serum resulting in complete inhibition of hemagglutination. Results were only valid for plates with the appropriate back-titration result (verifying 4 HAU/25 μL added) and a reference serum titer within 2-fold of the expected titer.NAI assayThe method for the Enzyme-Linked Lectin Assay (ELLA) assay was used to determine Neuraminidase-Inhibiting antibody titers. The source of antigen (NA) was titrated, and a standard amount was selected for incubation with serial dilutions of serum. Virus was used as the source of NA in all cases. Titration of sera was performed with serial dilutions of sera (heat inactivated at 56 °C for 1 h) and a standard amount of virus was added to duplicate wells of a fetuin-coated plate. This mixture was then incubated overnight (16–18 h); the next day, HRP conjugated Peanut Agglutinin PNA (diluted to 2.5 μg/mL) was added to the washed plate and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Substrate (ODP in Sodium citrate) was added and incubated for 10 min to develop the color. Next Stop buffer (1 N sulfuric acid) was added to stop the reaction. Plates were scanned for absorbance at OD 490 nm. The reduction or absence of color relative to a viral control indicated inhibition of NA activity due to the presence of NA-specific antibodies. NAI titers (IC50 values) were calculated from the OD readings and the results were graphed in GraphPad Prism. If ELLA titration curves did not allow a good fit to determine a reliable IC50 value, the samples were retested using a different dilution scheme to reach the 50% endpoint.T cell ELISPOT AssayComplete medium (DMEM1640 + 10% heat-inactivated FCS) was prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath. PBMCs were quickly thawed in a 37 °C water bath and transferred dropwise to conical tubes with the prewarmed medium. The tubes were centrifuged for 5 mins at 433 g in Allegra X-30R centrifuge (rotor SX4400, Beckman Coulter, Inc) and the cells were resuspended and counted using a Guava cell counter. Monkey IFNγ ELISPOT kit (Mabtech 3421M-4APW) and IL-13 ELISPOT kit (Mabtech 3470M-4APW) were used. Precoated plates provided by the kits were washed four times with sterile PBS and blocked with 200 µL of complete medium in 37 °C incubator for at least 30 min. A/SINGAPORE/INFIMH160019/2016 H3 peptides pool (Genscript Custom Order) (at 1 µg/mL of each peptide) were used as recall antigens in the assay. Two µg/mL of ConA (Sigma CAT#C5275) was used as a positive control. Fifty µL of recall antigens and 300,000 of PBMCs in 50 µL were added to each well for stimulation. The plates were placed in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 48 h.After the incubation, cells were removed, plates were washed 5 times with PBS, and 100 µL of 1 µg/mL biotinylated anti-IFNγ or anti-IL-13 detection antibodies were added to each well in the plates. After 2 hr incubation, the plates were washed 5 times with PBS and incubated with 100 µL of a 1:1000 dilution of streptavidin in each well for one hour at room temperature. Plates were developed with 100 µL of BCIP/NBT substrate solution until the spots emerged. Plates were rinsed by tap water, air-dried and scanned and counted using CTL ImmunoSpot Reader (Cellular Technology Ltd). T The data was reported as spots forming cells (SFC) per million PBMCs.Memory B cell (MBC) ELISPOT assayHuman IgG Single-Color memory B cell ELISPOT kit (CAT# NC1911372, CTL) was used per manufacturer’s instruction to measure A/Singapore/16/H3-specific and total IgG+ antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Differentiation of MBCs into ASCs was performed in PBMC using a stimulation cocktail provided by the kit. Briefly, frozen PBMCs were quickly thawed in a 37 °C water bath, mixed with DNase 1 (CAT# 90083, FISHER SCIENTIFIC) and transferred into the tube containing pre-warmed complete culture medium (CM) (RPMI 1640, (CAT# 22400-089, gibco) containing 10% FCS (CAT # SH30073.03, HyClone), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (CAT# P4333, Sigma)) for 5 minutes at 433 g in Allegra X-30R centrifuge (rotor SX4400, Beckman Coulter, Inc). Cell pellet was re-suspended in 5 ml of complete medium at 2 × 10(6) cells per ml and transferred to a T25 flask for 1 h in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The volume of cell suspension was then adjusted to 6 ml and B-Poly-S was added at 1:1000 dilution. Cells were left in CO2 incubator for stimulation for 4 days. PVDF microplates supplied by the kit were pre-wetted with 70% ethanol, rinsed and coated overnight with 80ul/well of either anti-human IgG capture Ab provided by the kit or A/Singapore/16/H3 recombinant protein at 4 μg/ml.Cells were harvested after 4 days of stimulation, washed, and counted and adjusted to the designated concentration in the CM. Coated microplates were washed with PBS, blocked for 1 h with the CM and emptied out. Cell suspension at 100 µl/well was added to the plates and incubated in CO2 incubator at 37 C for 18 h. After washing, 80 µl/well of 1:400 diluted anti-human IgG Biotin detection antibody was added to the plate and incubated at RT for 2 h. Following washing, Streptavidin-AP at 1:1000 dilution was added to the plate at 80 ul/well for 1 h. Freshly prepared Substrate solution was added and incubated at RT for 18 min. Plates were rinsed by tap water, air-dried and scanned and counted using CTL ImmunoSpot Reader (Cellular Technology Ltd). For each individual animal the number of IgG+ and number of A/Singapore/16/H3-specific ASCs was calculated per million of PBMCs. The frequency of antigen-specific ASCs was calculated as % of antigen-specific ASCs to the total IgG+ ASCs. To assess assay background the negative control wells on every plate were coated with PBS (no background was detected).Statistical analysisFor estimating the Tmax of Radiance, non-parametric method was used to estimate the Tmax of individual subject based on observed data. For estimating the half-life of Radiance, assuming exponential decay model for radiance after reaching the maximum value, linear model was fitted to log transformed data per subject during the time course from the maximum radiance to decay to baseline (we estimate the baseline using the average of radiance in saline group). The half-life was estimated as the time point when the log radiance had reached the middle point between maximum and baseline values. For analysis of different readouts with results summarized as geometric mean and SE model based geometric means and SEs were estimated from mixed effect model for repeated measures where the response was the log transformed readouts, vaccination was fixed effect and time was repeated measure; log-based means and SE estimates from the model were then back transformed to get geometric means and SEs. For weight change over time, descriptive statistical analysis was used. Medians and ranges of each group of the maximum %body weight loss from baseline (day 0) over time were reported to evaluate the worse scenarios; medians and ranges of each group of the %body weight change from baseline at the last observation were reported to evaluate the body weight recovery. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4. All statistical tests were two-sided with significant level of 0.05.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Study: Engineered Nanoparticulate Vaccines to Combat Recurring and Pandemic Influenza Threats. Image Credit: insta_photos/Shutterstock.com Here, new insights have emerged into nanoparticle vaccines' design and synthesis to resist recurring and pandemic influenza (flu) and other dangers of respiratory infectious disease. Influenza, the Most Serious Infectious Respiratory Diseases One of the most serious and infectious respiratory contagious diseases is influenza. Infection with the influenza virus creates annual outbreaks and occasional pandemics, leading to a huge health and economic burden worldwide. Schematic illustration of influenza virus structure, conserved influenza immunogens, and modern influenza vaccine types. M2e, M2 extracellular domain. VLP, virus-like particle. © Dong, C., and Wang, B. (2021) Flu viruses are RNA viruses with an envelope that belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family. Present seasonal flu vaccines induce strain-specific immunity that quickly wears off, have low efficiencies against misaligned circulating strains, and has no effect on epidemics. Next Generation of Vaccine with Nanotechnology Restrictions of existing influenza vaccines hope to be overcome by a next-generation widespread influenza vaccine that evokes long-lasting cross-protective protection against variant flu strains. Nanotechnology is essential for the implementation of such vaccines. Nanoparticle vaccines can best mimic the seasonal influenza nanostructure with elevated antigen loads, allowing for targeted delivery and controlled antigen release and collaborating with single-molecule adjuvants to increase vaccine effectiveness and breadth. Various nanoparticle platforms for vaccine development. © Dong, C., and Wang, B. (2021) Furthermore, nanoparticle vaccines can enable rapid and scalable manufacturing, reduce cold-chain dependence, implement antigens flexibly modularly, and be generated at a low cost. To date, several nanoparticle formulas have demonstrated promising results in terms of creating cross-reactive seasonal flu immunity. Development of Influenza Vaccines To reduce the public health consequences of seasonal and pandemic influenza, the development of a vaccine that provides long-term cross-protection against numerous flu viruses becomes a top priority. The recognition of viral proteins by the host immune system is required for the induction of a protective immune response against influenza. Seasonal flu vaccine induces strain-specific antibody production to the HA head's high variability immune determinants. These kinds of antibodies are frequently neutralizing and efficient in combating viral replication, but they are susceptible to immune evasion. Significant advancements in flu immunology and vaccinology suggest that universal flu vaccines targeting correlated immune determinant factors and providing broad protection against variant strains are viable, though challenges remain. The development of universal influenza vaccines requires the design and characterization of novel immune aims as immunogens.

(2021) Challenges of Developing Vaccines However, significant difficulties have been encountered in developing a HA-stalk-based universal influenza vaccine: 1) the complexity in designing and building and expressing the HA stalk antigens besides other HA sequences; 2) the reduction immunogenicity of subunit vaccines when compared to particulate antigens; and 3) the comparatively short duration of the immunity induced. Nonetheless, several studies have shown that HA stalk region sequences, especially those found on nanoparticle vaccines, can be used as immunogens in the development of broadly protective influenza vaccines. Nucleic Acid Vaccine as the Most Recent Advancement The latest advancements in vaccine technology are nucleic acid (mRNA and DNA) vaccines. Nucleic acid vaccines are noninfectious and can enhance potent immune responses by using host cellular machines and equipment to produce encoded protein antigens. Specifically, mRNA vaccines are less dangerous than DNA vaccines since they can be deteriorated naturally and do not integrate into the host's genomic DNA. RNA methods of production, such as the use of modified nucleosides, have enhanced mRNA resistance to RNases. Self-amplifying replicon RNA could be used to achieve long-term antigen expression. The extraordinary success of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccines promotes the development of mRNA vaccines against other infectious diseases, such as influenza. Favorable New Technology, Nanoparticles and their Advantages One of its most favorable technological innovations for developing next-generation influenza vaccines is the nanoparticle vaccine framework. Nanoparticles can house numerous vaccine components (proteins, peptides, DNA, mRNA, and molecular adjuvants) in a reconfigurable, tunable, and flexible manner, facilitating the development of low-cost vaccines by promoting organizationally simplified vaccine manufacturing, collection, distribution, and administration. Tailor-made nanoparticle vaccines can program the initiation of potent broadly protective immune function while also allowing for antigen dose reduction. Tailored nanoparticle vaccines can process the induction of potent broadly protective immune function while also allowing for antigen dose reduction and become effective for influenza.

To determine the strains of circulating AIVs that may pose a risk to poultry and humans, regular surveillance studies must be performed. Here, we report the surveillance of circulating AIVs in South Korea during the winter seasons of 2009–2013. A total of 126 AIVs were isolated from 7942 fecal samples from wild migratory birds, with a total isolation rate of 1.59%. H1‒H7 and H9‒H11 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes, and N1‒N3, N5, and N7‒N9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were successfully isolated, with H6 and N2 as the most predominant HA and NA subtypes, respectively. Sequence identity search showed that the HA and NA genes of the isolates were highly similar to those of low-pathogenicity influenza strains from the East Asian-Australasian flyway. No match was found for the HA genes of high-pathogenicity influenza strains. Thus, the AIV strains circulating in wild migratory birds from 2009 to 2013 in South Korea likely had low pathogenicity. Continuous surveillance studies such as this one must be performed to identify potential precursors of influenza viruses that may threaten animal and human health.

In wild bird species, AIVs are divided into 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes based on serogrouping, and generally cause asymptomatic or mild disease3. Although wild aquatic birds typically carry low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), transmission and adaptation of these viruses to other bird species (e.g., domestic fowl) and to non-avian species (i.e., mammals) may result in respiratory disease4. Transmission of AIVs from wild waterfowl to poultry may arise from direct contact between the animals or their contaminated environments5. Poultry in farms infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses are typically culled to prevent further spread of the virus, resulting in large agricultural and economic losses to affected locations6. Among the HA subtypes that have the ability to cross the mammalian species barrier, two HA subtypes, H5 and H7, are associated with high pathogenicity7. Notably, HPAI H5N1 and H7N9 viruses are genetic reassortants of LPAI segments8,9. Thus, LPAI viruses are potential precursors of novel HPAI viruses. However, since it is virtually impossible to prevent the transmission of influenza A virus from wildfowl to domestic and wild animals, continuous surveillance of wild birds must be conducted to monitor and detect strains that have the potential to cause disease in both animals and humans.In this study, we report the surveillance of AIVs in wild birds in South Korea during the winter seasons of 2009 to 2013. We isolated fecal samples from migratory bird stopover sites in South Korea, which is part of the East Asian-Australasian flyway (EAAF), and performed nucleotide sequence analysis to determine the distribution of AIVs among migratory wildfowl in South Korea.ResultsPrevalence of avian influenza virusesDuring the winter seasons of 2009‒2013, a total of 7942 wild bird fecal samples were collected from wild migratory bird habitats in South Korea (Fig. 1a). HPAI isolates have been obtained from wildfowl in these sites, and these locations are adjacent to sites of known HPAI outbreaks among poultry in South Korea, making these sites ideal for surveillance10. From the 7942 fecal samples, 126 AIVs were isolated through the standard chicken egg isolation method11,12 (Table 1). Eighteen viruses were isolated in 2009, 4 in 2010, 18 in 2011, 1 in 2012, and 85 in 2013 (Table 1). The annual AIV isolation rate ranged from 0.42 to 5.14%, and the total virus isolation rate was 1.59% (Table 1). The location with the highest number of isolates was Cheonsuman Bay in Chungnam, South Korea (Fig. 1a).Figure 1Sampling sites and hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes of isolated avian influenza viruses from the fecal matter of wild migratory birds from 2009–2013. (a) Sampling sites (triangles) from 2009–2013, and representative clusters of highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in poultry in South Korea from 2008–2014 (circles). Frequencies of isolates (out of 126 total isolates) per sampling site are shown in the pie chart. All (b) HA and (c) NA subtypes were identified through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using universal primers.Full size imageTable 1 Isolation rates of AIVs from wild migratory bird fecal samples in South Korea, winter 2009‒2013.Full size tableHA and NA subtype combinationsReverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using full-length influenza A virus universal primers was performed to determine the HA and NA subtypes of the isolates13. In the course of the 5-year study, we were able to identify the HA and NA subtypes of 118 out of 126 isolates (Table 2). In particular, we were able to isolate the H1‒H7 and H9‒H11 HA subtypes, and the N1‒N3, N5, and N7‒N9 NA subtypes of influenza virus from the fecal matter of wild migratory birds. The distributions of the HA and NA subtypes isolated per year are shown in Fig. 1b,c.Table 2 Distribution of influenza A virus HA and NA subtypes among 126 avian influenza virus isolates.Full size tableOver the 5-year sampling period, H6 (38.1%), H5 (22.2%), and H1 (11.9%) were the most frequently isolated HA subtypes, followed by H11 (8.7%), H2 (7.1%), H10 (5.6%), H9 (2.4%), H3 (1.6%), H4 (1.6%), and H7 (0.8%) (Table 2; Fig. 2a). Viruses belonging to the H8 and H12‒H16 subtypes were not detected. The most frequently detected NA subtypes were N2 (33.3%), N1 (27%), and N3 (16.7%), followed by N8 (7.1%), N7 (5.6%), N9 (2.4%), and N5 (1.6%) (Table 2; Fig. 2b). Viruses belonging to the N4 and N6 subtypes were not detected. However, the NA subtypes of 8 samples were not identified (NX: 6.3%) possibly due to mutations on the sites targeted by our NA primer sets. In total, 28 combinations of HA and NA subtypes were isolated (Table 2; Fig. 2c), and the most frequently isolated subtype was H6N2 which accounted for 19.8% (n = 25) of all isolates, followed by H6N1 (13.5%, n = 17), H1N1 and H5N2 (at 8.7% each with n = 11 per subtype), and H5N3 (7.1%, n = 9). Certain HA subtypes were found in combination with only one NA subtype: H3 combined with only N8; H4 with N2; H7 with N7; and H9 with N2. Based on the HA and NA sequencing data, no co-infection with two or more AIV subtypes was found in any sample. There was also high variability among the isolated AIV subtypes and the isolation rates per year.Figure 2Overall frequency of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) isolated from the fecal matter of wild migratory birds in Korea (2009–2013). The frequencies of (a) HA subtypes, (b) NA subtypes, and (c) HA and NA combinations of AIV isolates were calculated relative to the total number of isolates (n = 126). NX: unknown NA subtypes.Full size imageHA and NA sequence comparison of avian influenza isolatesTo determine the genetic relationship of the isolates with HPAI HA, we compared the HA and NA genes of representative avian influenza isolates with known sequences. BLAST analysis of the HA and NA gene segments of avian influenza isolates revealed that most of them were similar to Eastern Asia genetic strains circulating in China, Korea, Japan, and Mongolia (Supplementary Table S1). All the H6- and H11-type isolates were found to have HA genes closely related to strains from the Republic of Georgia and the Netherlands (Supplementary Table S1). In our analysis, the HA gene nucleotide sequences of avian influenza isolates were similar to those of low-pathogenicity influenza strains and did not match any high-pathogenicity influenza strains.Phylogenetic analyses of H6- and N2-subtype isolatesGiven the frequency of H6-subtypes among our isolates and, we next compared representative H6 isolates from our study with previously reported H6 isolates from different locations via phylogenetic analysis. In general, our isolates clustered with those obtained from wild birds in different locations along the EAAF, particularly from China and Japan (Fig. 3a). Notably, some of our samples clustered with a 2016 isolate from the Pacific flyway, and some samples clustered with isolates from the East Atlantic flyway obtained from earlier years (2007 and 2010). These findings indicate that the genetic variants of H6-subtype AIVs that circulate in South Korea is generally confined to the EAAF. However, some of the H6 genetic variants in 2009–2013 may have been carried to different flyways. Genetic variants from other flyways have also contributed to the diversity of H6-subtype AIVs in South Korea in 2009–2013.Figure 3Phylogenetic analyses of representative H6- and N2-subtype avian influenza fecal isolates in South Korea in 2009–2013. The assembled (a) H6-subtype hemagglutinin and (b) N2-subtype neuraminidase coding sequences of representative isolates (blue, underlined) were compared to different isolates from various locations. Wildfowl migratory flyways that cover these locations are indicated. Bootstrap values ≥ 600 are shown. BSMF Black Sea-Mediterranean flyway, EAAF East Asian-Australasian flyway. Red diamond: the Republic of Georgia is at the intersection of the BSMF, Central Asian, and East Africa-West Asian flyways.Full size imageWe also compared representative N2 isolates with previously reported isolates from various locations through phylogenetic analysis. In general, most of our isolates clustered with those of the Eurasian lineage (Fig. 3b). However, one isolate, A/AB/Korea/JB10/11(H9N2), along with other samples from China, clustered with isolates from the North American flyways obtained at an earlier year (2006). This indicates an event between 2006 and 2011 that carried the North American N2 genetic variant(s) to Eurasian flyways.DiscussionSince the zoonotic emergence that caused lethal outbreaks in poultry and humans in 1997, HPAI H5N1 virus strains have been established in domestic and wild bird populations14,15,16. HPAI outbreaks in domestic birds have taken place in all regions of the world between January 2013 and May 2021, and the most affected regions were Asia, Africa, and Europe17. Since 2003, South Korea has reported several HPAI outbreaks, mainly caused by H5N1, H5N8, and H5N6 viruses, and migratory birds are proposed to be the sources of these HPAI strains18,19. Previously, only the H5 subtypes were associated with serious infectious disease; however, strains of other HA subtypes (e.g., H6, H7, H9, and H10) have recently infected humans and have shown pandemic potential20,21,22.In this surveillance study, we collected a total of 7942 fecal samples from stopover sites of wild migratory birds in South Korea. While we did not find the HPAI H5 subtypes (H5N1 and H5N8) that broke out in South Korea, we were able to isolate 126 samples of LPAI viruses, including those belonging to the H5, H6, H7, and H9 subtypes. There was high variability in isolation rates and subtype frequencies across the years. In particular, we had a very low isolation rate in 2012 despite collecting more samples that year than in 2009 and 2010. Isolation rates and AIV variability ultimately depend on the migration patterns of the birds that carry the AIVs. This may, in turn, be affected by shifts in seasonal patterns and other environmental factors23. The timing of sampling may also affect isolation rate, as this will be affected by the bird species present in the stopover sites, with certain species (e.g. Anseriformes and Charadriiformes) more likely to carry AIVs across flyways than others24. Compositions of the population (e.g., frequency of juveniles), which is also influenced by timing and environmental factors, may also affect AIV diversity25,26. However, for this study, we did not identify the species sources of the fecal samples, so we could not know for certain whether the bird population at the time of sampling affected our AIV isolation rates. These factors should be considered in future long-term surveillance studies, so that we may further understand the dynamics of AIVs among migratory waterfowl.The most frequently isolated HA subtype was H6, which accounted for 38.1% (n = 48) of the isolates, with H6N2 and H6N1 being the most prevalent. Our results are in line with a study that reported that H6N2 and H6N1 were the most commonly isolated H6-subtype IAVs isolated from migratory and domestic birds in a surveillance study in South Korea in 2008 to 200927. Likewise, a number of studies in other locations, including China, North America, and Europe, have reported that H6-subtype AIVs are the most commonly detected AIV subtypes among wild and domestic fowl28,29,30,31. Given that H6-subtype AIVs are classified as LPAI, the implications of the prevalence of this subtype to animal and human health are still unclear. However, AIVs of the H6 subtype may reassort with AIVs of other subtypes and act as precursors to HPAIs8, thereby emphasizing the need for continuous surveillance and characterization of LPAIs in the wild.As expected, most of our H6- and N2-subtype isolates clustered with samples from the EAAF, especially with isolates obtained in China and Japan. In a previous study, five H6 subtypes (H6N1, H6N2, H6N5, H6N6, and H6N8) were found to have circulated in Eastern and Southern China from 2002 to 2010 and 2009 to 2011, with H6N2 and H6N6 being predominant28,32. Four H6 subtypes (H6N1, H6N2, H6N5, and H6N8) circulated in South Korea between 2009 and 2013. South Korea is one of the migratory stopover sites on the EAAF, and our results imply that migratory birds passing through Korea along the EAAF do not carry all the AIV subtypes circulating in China. A few of our H6 samples also clustered with samples from the Pacific and the East Atlantic flyways obtained from different years, and one of the representative N2 samples clustered with isolates from the North American flyways. These findings indicate that intermingling among migratory birds occasionally occurs in breeding and wintering sites where flyways intersect and facilitates the movement of genetic variants from the EAAF to other flyways and vice versa.Here, we report the distribution of circulating AIVs in migratory water birds in South Korea during 2009‒2013. The most prevalent AIVs were of the H6 subtype, and the circulating AIVs in this period were similar to low-pathogenicity strains along the EAAF. Because wild birds are able to transmit pathogenic influenza viruses to local fowl, surveillance studies such as this are important so that we may be able to predict and mitigate the effects of AIVs on animal and human health.MethodsSample collection and virus isolationThrough surveillance studies from winter of 2009 to 2013, a total of 7942 fecal samples were collected from stopover sites of wild migratory birds in South Korea (Table 1, Fig. 1a). Fecal samples were stored in transport medium composed of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and glycerol (50%) with antibiotics (1000 U/ml of penicillin G and polymyxin B, 500 U/ml of nystatin, 250 µg/ml of gentamicin, 60 µg/ml of ofloxacin, and 200 µg/ml of sulfamethoxazole). The collected samples were stored at − 80 °C until analysis.Samples were suspended in antibiotic-supplemented PBS and inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs12. The allantoic fluid was collected. Turbid fluid was assumed to be contaminated with bacteria or fungi and was discarded. All viral isolates were collected from the first egg passage. Viral presence was identified through hemagglutination assay using 0.5% chicken red blood cells11.RT-PCR and sequence analysisViral gene amplification was performed as previously described25. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs infected with the supernatant of fecal samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For HA and NA gene subtyping, one-step RT-PCR was carried out using the One Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with HA- or NA-specific universal primer sets designed and described in a previous study13. The RT-PCR reactions were prepared according to manufacturer instructions. Each 50-μL reaction contained 1.5 μL of each primer (20 pmol/μL) and 2 μL of viral RNA (1 pg–2 µg). Reverse transcription was performed at 50 °C for 30 min, and standard PCR was performed with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. After purification with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), the amplified gene segments were commercially sequenced at Cosmogenetech Co. (Seoul, South Korea) using the high-throughput DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), which is based on the Sanger sequencing technology. Full-length sequences (HA: 1710 bp; NA: 1410 bp) were assembled using the Lasergene sequence analysis software package (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). A BLASTn query was performed to identify the HA and NA subtypes of the isolates based on the obtained sequences.Phylogenetic analyses of H6 and N2 coding sequencesThe assembled complete coding sequences of representative H6- and N2-subtype isolates were aligned using CLUSTAL V33. Rooted phylogenetic trees were prepared using the neighbor-joining method (1000 bootstrap replicates) and then visualized with the NJ Plot software34. Accession numbers of HA and NA sequences of isolates included in the phylogenetic analyses are listed in Supplementary Table S2.

But they are still likely to prevent severe illness. “From our lab-based studies it looks like a major mismatch,” Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania who led the study, told CNN. It’s bad news for the vaccine, he said. Influenza vaccines protect against four different strains of the flu: H3N2, H1N1 and two strains of influenza B. Hensley’s study only covers H3N2, but that happens to be the main circulating strain. The vaccine mismatch may help explain an outbreak of flu at the University of Michigan last month that affected more than 700 people. More than 26% of those who tested positive had been vaccinated against flu – the same percentage as those who tested negative. That indicates the vaccine was not effective in preventing infection. It’s what flu viruses do, Hensley said. “We have been monitoring this virus for several months,” he said. Flu viruses mutate all the time—far more than other viruses, including the coronavirus. And different variations can circulate at the same time. But this version of H3N2 has changes that help it escape the antibodies the body makes in response to vaccines. A pharmacy in New York City offers vaccines for COVID-19, flu, shingles and pneumonia on December 6, 2021. Ted Shaffrey/AP Related article Flu and Covid-19 cases rising in much of the US Antibodies are the first line of defense against invaders like viruses, and the current vaccine doesn’t seem to generate any of the right antibodies against this new, mutated version of H3N2, called 2a2 for short. Luckily, the changes are unlikely to affect the second line of defense offered by immune system – cells called T-cells, so even if the vaccines don’t protect against infection, they are likely to protect people against severe disease and death, Hensley said. “Studies have clearly shown that seasonal influenza vaccines consistently prevent hospitalizations and deaths even in years where there are large antigenic mismatches,” Hensley and colleagues wrote in a report posted online as a pre-print. It’s not published in a peer reviewed journal. “Influenza vaccinations will be crucial for reducing hospitalizations as SARS-CoV-2 and 2a2 H3N2 viruses co-circulate in the coming months.” The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said influenza virtually disappeared last year, but it’s coming back this year. The big fear is a “double whammy” of flu and Covid-19. Susana Sanchez, a Nurse Practitioner, administers a flu vaccination to Ana Maria Flores at a CVS pharmacy and MinuteClinic on September 10, 2021 in Miami, Florida. CVS Health is offering the flu shots by appointment or walking in as health experts encourage people to get their flu shots in hopes of preventing a bad flu season. Joe Raedle/Getty Images Related article Yes, there will be a flu season this year, CDC says “Population immunity against influenza viruses is likely low since these viruses have not circulated widely during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Hensley’s team wrote. “Social distancing, mask wearing, and decreases in international travel have likely contributed to reduced global circulation of influenza viruses. Once COVID-19-related restrictions are eased or lifted, it is possible that influenza viruses will circulate widely due to lack of infection-induced population immunity over the past two years.” Flu vaccine efficacy changes from year to year. Part of the problem is the lead time needed to make influenza vaccines. Most are made using old technology that requires the use of chicken eggs incubated for weeks. So vaccine strains are chosen six months ahead of when the vaccines will be delivered. The virus can evolve in that time, or different strains can come to dominate, and that appears to have happened this year, Hensley said. In years that the vaccine doesn’t match the circulating viruses well, vaccine effectiveness plummets – sometimes to as low as 6%, as overall effectiveness was against H3N2 flu in the 2014-2015 flu season, according to the CDC. The changes in the H3N2 virus this year are reminiscent of the mutations that rendered the vaccine so weak in 2014-2015, Hensley said.

Things can still change, the researchers noted. “While cases of 2a2 H3N2 infections are quickly rising in the United States and other parts of the world, it is possible that other clades of H3N2 will become predominant in the future,” they wrote. “It is also possible that H1N1 or influenza B viruses might dominate later in the 2021-2022 season.” It’s not yet clear how well the vaccines might match those strains. According to the CDC, influenza kills anywhere between 12,000 and 52,000 people a year, depending on the flu season, and puts as many as 700,000 people into the hospital.

Before each flu season, scientists must predict which strains will be the most common, and design a flu shot to match these predictions. This year’s flu shot includes four strains. But one, a version of the H3N2 strain of influenza, is turning out to be a bad match for the version of H3N2, called 2a2, that’s in wide circulation in the U.S., according to a study from Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. Hensley’s study was posted Wednesday to a preprint server, meaning it has not yet been peer-reviewed. So far this season, the H3N2 strain makes up for at least 99 percent of all flu cases in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though the agency does not specify how many of those cases are caused by the 2a2 version of the strain.The presence of the 2a2 version means the vaccine may not protect as well against infection, because it’s not the version included in the vaccine, Hensley said. The flu shot is never a perfect match for the influenza viruses that end up in wide circulation, but even so, the vaccine still reduces a person’s risk of severe illness from the flu. “Influenza vaccination is the best protection against severe disease and illness,” he said. “Even in these years of mismatch, we see high effectiveness against hospitalizations and severe disease.”Still, the mismatch Hensley has observed so far is striking. The last time there was a mismatch this significant was during the 2014-15 flu season, he said. Even so, the vaccine prevented nearly 40,000 hospitalizations and almost 4,000 deaths from the flu that season, the CDC estimates. Flu experts have warned that the nation could be at risk for a severe flu season this year after flu cases reached an all-time low last year, when large swaths of the country were shut down because of the pandemic. And the mismatch could exacerbate the situation.“Once this fire gets started, it may spread out of control,” Hensley said.Health officials are already seeing flu outbreaks. In November, the CDC said it was investigating an outbreak of influenza at the University of Michigan, where at least 528 students have tested positive for the flu since Oct. 6.Dr. Mark Roberts, director of the Public Health Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, said the data in the new preprint "is certainly consistent with what I know from the rest of the world right now.”The potential, he said, for a “really large influenza season this year is real.” “So much of the immunity that you get in a population comes from the people who had influenza the year before,” said Roberts, who was not involved with Hensley’s research. “There could be substantially bigger epidemics this year, especially if the strain that appears is different than the strains we’ve seen.”Still, with the rise of the omicron variant, there’s still a chance the U.S. could have a modest flu season this year, he said. That’s because alarm over the variant could cause more of the public to go back to social distancing and mask wearing.“That’s all better for the flu, too,” he said.Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

ByEricka ConantDecember 16, 2021 File photo: A syringe with an influenza vaccine inside heads to its mark during a flu vaccination at Eastfield College in Mesquite, Texas, Thursday, Jan. 23, 2020. (AP Photo/LM Otero) The lack of immunity among children has made this year’s flu season very unpredictable. Last year saw a mild flu season compared to prior years, because of widespread social distancing and mask wearing in response to the coronavirus. During the 2019-2020 season, about 22,000 people died of flu in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientific American has reported that the 2020-2021 flu season saw the illness drop to relatively low levels, with about 700 people dying. At a press conference Thursday, Philadelphia’s health commissioner, Dr. Cheryl Bettigole, warned that because many people have relaxed precautions against the coronavirus for the holidays, the city is expecting a worse flu season this year compared to 2020. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor With hospitals already near capacity, Bettigole said that even a small number of flu hospitalizations could overload health care systems. Among those most at risk are children who have gone back to in-person learning. “That’s because a lot of kids, particularly younger children, may be more vulnerable to infection, because their immune systems have not been challenged to build immunity against the flu over the last two years, when we’ve taken measures like social distancing and masking,” Dr. Ron Keren, chief medical officer at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said at the press conference.

Flu, coupled with the demand for COVID-19 care, has put a strain on children’s hospitals. Since July, CHOP has been routinely operating close to or above 100% capacity. “At CHOP, we started to see kids in our primary care practices, emergency department, and in-patient units sick with the flu,” Keren said. CHOP has already seen twice as many flu-related emergency room visits than it did in prior years. Nationwide, the percentage of kids vaccinated against the flu this year is much lower than in previous years. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor According to CDC data for children ages 6 months to 17 years, Philadelphia is 11% behind in flu vaccination rates compared to the same time last year, and 19% behind where it was in 2019. “I’m very concerned about what this could mean for children’s hospitals this winter. All hospitals, but particularly children’s hospitals, are struggling to manage the large number of patients needing in-patient care,” said Keren. Because many kids are now back in the classroom and in sports and other extracurricular activities, they are more likely to be exposed to the flu, and that could result in a much higher number of infections. “If we have a particularly bad flu season this year, it’ll make it challenging to provide care to all the children who need it. To help us avoid this situation, please get your children vaccinated,” Keren said.

According to the CDC, Black children had lower flu vaccination coverage than children in all other racial/ethnic groups in the 2020–2021 season. “It’s no surprise that just as the pandemic has been more detrimental to people of color, we’re also more likely to experience a higher risk of severe influenza illness. This is very worrisome for me,” Bryant-Stephens said. Other people at especially high risk include adults over 65, residents of nursing homes and long-term treatment centers, pregnant individuals, and people with pre-existing conditions. The Health Department is strongly recommending that everyone over 6 months of age get a flu shot. People can get flu shots at the same time as the COVID vaccine or booster. Earlier this week, Bettigole advised against holiday gatherings of multiple households, saying that, as a health professional, she believes it’s necessary to stop the spread of the virus.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved NEWS Coronavirus News When Should You Get Tested for the Flu? By Claire Bugos Published on December 14, 2021 Fact checked by Angela Underwood Print Verywell Health / Brianna Gilmartin Close Key Takeaways The symptoms of flu, COVID-19, and the common cold can overlap, making it difficult to diagnose a respiratory illness without a test.For people who are unvaccinated against the flu or live with chronic conditions, influenza infection can lead to adverse outcomes including hospitalization or death.There are different antiviral treatments available for COVID-19 and the flu. Getting a test can help you figure out which is right for you. As the United States enters its second flu season during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts warn of the risk of a “twindemic” of the two respiratory illnesses. The number of flu cases are steadily increasing as the flu season picks up steam. The U.S. saw 841 influenza-related hospitalizations in the week ending on December 4, nearly a double from the week prior, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The number of flu-related hospitalizations pale in comparison to the more than 55,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, since the two respiratory illnesses often present similar symptoms, it can be important to know which virus you are infected with early on to inform treatment. William Schaffner, MD, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID), told Verywell that COVID-19 and the flu can present in ways that are overlapping, "particularly in their milder forms." If left untreated, a case of the flu could progress into pneumonia or another serious complication. This is especially true for older adults, those with chronic conditions, and unvaccinated people. How to Know if You Have the Flu If you are experiencing flu-like symptoms, it is first and foremost important to test for COVID-19. Especially as the new highly transmissible Omicron variant circulates, getting a COVID-19 diagnosis early will allow you to self-isolate and protect others from infection. For a flu diagnosis, Schaffner recommends first reaching out to a primary care provider via a telehealth portal, email, or phone. Showing up to a doctor’s office or urgent care site puts others at risk of getting sick and it may be unnecessary unless you’re experiencing a medical emergency. Peter Chin-Hong, MD, professor of infectious diseases at University of California, San Francisco, recommends taking a flu test if you tested negative for COVID-19. While uncommon, it’s possible to be infected with both COVID-19 and flu at the same time. “I think a lot of people are stuck in limbo land with symptoms,” Chin-Hong told Verywell. “You keep doing a million BinaxNOW assays just because you want to convince yourself that you don't have COVID.” Health providers can diagnose a case of the flu through a description of symptoms, a physical exam, or through a nasal or throat swab test. There was an increase in the number of flu tests this year, driven in part by concern that this flu season would see a particularly high case rate, Chin-Hong said. In the last week of November, nearly 59,000 samples were tested for the flu, compared with 22,000 specimens during the same week in 2018. Dual COVID-19 and flu tests make it possible to get tested for both viruses with a single swab. But these tests aren’t widely used and there’s room for at-home rapid tests to become as commonplace for flu as they are for COVID-19, Chin-Hong said. “It's very tough to diagnose flu by symptoms only. Back in the pre-COVID days, it was probably a little bit easier to make a distinction between severe flu, classic flu, and other things” Chin-Hong said. “Now it's more complicated, because COVID can present like flu, so it's harder to tell without doing a test.” Getting Treated for the Flu Your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication if you have the flu. There are four FDA-approved drugs, including Tamiflu (osteltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir). These treatments will slow the progression of the illness to minimize the risk of hospitalization and severe outcomes. Only about 44% of Americans are vaccinated against influenza in 2021, according to the CDC. For those who are unvaccinated, a flu can lead to serious adverse outcomes, including hospitalization and death if left untreated. “Promptness is important if one wishes to benefit from treatment,” Schaffner said. “It's frequently the case that we don't present on day one, two, or three of our illness. We're down to day four or five before we present ourselves to the doctor and finally say, 'Oh, it's not going away. I guess I'd better call the doctor.' And by that time, the capacity to intervene with treatment is really substantially diminished.” Getting tested and receiving treatment early in the course of illness is especially important for people at higher risk of complications or severe disease, like older people and those with underlying conditions. Various strains of the influenza virus circulate each flu season. This season, a majority of the sampled specimens are H3N2, an influenza A strain. This strain typically affects older adults the most. According to the “original antigenic sin” theory, the immune system learns to respond to viruses like the flu based on its first infection. H3N2 didn’t evolve until 1968, meaning most adults over the age of 50 likely had their first childhood experience with the flu before this strain began circulating, leaving them relatively vulnerable to H3N2. Additionally, older adults tend to have weaker immune systems and have health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which make it more complicated to treat the flu. The majority of cases are among young people aged 5 to 24, though the number of cases among adults older than 25 are on the rise, according to the CDC. “If you needed an additional reason to get your flu vaccine this year, the fact that A(H3N2) is sticking its nose out already ought to be good reason,” Schaffner said. “Even partial protection is better than no protection at all, particularly for those among us who are so frail—older persons and people with underlying illnesses." Fortunately, this year’s flu vaccine contains antigens to protect against the H3N2-like virus. It also accounts for other strains that may become widespread or dominant later in the flu season. “That's why the flu vaccine has four different types in it—not only to hedge bets, but to cover multiple strains that are probably circulating at the same time,” Chin-Hong added. Mitigation efforts like proper hand-washing, disinfecting surfaces, staying home when you feel sick, and wearing a mask can minimize infection risk and keep vulnerable people safe. "In the pre-COVID days, we were kind of living fatalistically and thinking that 'oh, well if you get it, you get it.' But there are a lot of things that you can do to help protect your family members, your friends, your loved ones, your circle,” Chin-Hong said. “We're still in the beginning of flu," he added. "People can make a difference by getting the flu shot." What This Means For You If you have any flu-like symptoms, get tested for COVID-19 immediately. If your test comes back negative, call your doctor to check if you should go in for a flu test. Healthcare providers may be able to prescribe antiviral medication for the flu.

A total of 8,583 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases have been reported so far in all but two of the state’s 67 counties. That includes 2,466 cases in Philadelphia and the four suburban counties. It is surely an underestimate, the state said, because most people with flu do not see a doctor or seek testing.AdvertisementHowever, public health leaders say testing for flu is likely unusually high this year, because that is the only sure way to differentiate between flu and COVID-19.The state estimates that 120 to 2,000 people die of flu complications each year in Pennsylvania. So far this season, there have been three known deaths.The state data show that cases are rising unusually fast for this early in the season — faster than in any of the last eight years. Last year, there were very few flu cases as people isolated due to COVID and wore masks during rare trips into public spaces.In its report for the week ending Dec. 11, New Jersey said spread in the state is moderate. So far, the flu season seems to be following a typical pattern. However, flu activity is high in northeast and central east counties. Positive flu tests are rising.Several other respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, are also circulating.The CDC said flu activity was low but increasing nationwide during its most recent report for the week ending Dec. 4.

But it didn’t happen. Flu outlook looks more severe The 2020-21 flu season was considered “unusually low” in the U.S. and globally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Between September 2020 and May 2021, only 1,600 out of 820,000 respiratory specimens were positive for an influenza strain nationwide. Do not expect another easy flu season this year, said Dr. Stacey Rose, assistant professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine. This year has the potential for increased respiratory illnesses across the country because of fewer masks, relaxed restrictions and holiday gatherings with friends and families, she said. “Folks are traveling – we’re different from where we were last year. You see it in commercials; this is the year where everyone wants to be back together,” Rose said. “No one in the commercials is wearing masks.” During the summer, Texas children experienced an untimely surge in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which resulted in multiple hospitalizations. While RSV is less contagious than COVID and flu, Rose said that virus’ spread could be indicative of what the city may experience with respiratory illnesses in colder months. Because of mild weather in November and December, Southeast Texas typically experiences a delayed flu season, Rose said. This is good news for Houstonians who have yet to get their annual flu shot. Flu shot offers best protection “If people haven’t gotten their flu shots, absolutely still get them,” she said. “So much attention right now is on COVID, but if you know the influenza vaccine helps with morbidity and mortality, why wouldn’t you still try to prevent it?” Most people can take most vaccines, including people who have an egg allergy. Pregnant women, elderly people, babies and toddlers and obese individuals are most at-risk of developing severe flu and should be vaccinated early. The annual flu shot wasn’t universally recommended by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices before 2010. Rose said the emergence of H1N1, or swine flu, influenced regulators to recommend flu vaccination for everyone, regardless of age or medical history. “None of us have been part of a pandemic before; the closest experience was when we had swine flu,” Rose said. “Maybe that was our initial wakeup call, and it pales in comparison in to our experiences with COVID-19.” As the pandemic enters its third year, congestion and sniffles are difficult to discern. Unfortunately, there’s no immediate way to know whether the symptoms are flu, COVID or the common cold, Rose said. Symptoms and testing Since the flu mirrors COVID, it’s important to schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider or a local pharmacy to be tested. It is possible to have both COVID and flu at the same time, but the occurrences are rare. If a person has COVID, it could take them longer to experience symptoms than if they have the flu. Typically, flu presents in the body from one to four days after infection whereas COVID patients experience symptoms about five days after being infected. Symptoms can appear two to 14 days after the initial COVID exposure, the CDC reported. Both flu and COVID include these symptoms: fever or feeling feverish/having chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle pain or body aches, headache, vomiting or diarrhea and change in or loss of taste or smell –though it is more frequent with COVID. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTS) provide results within 10-15 minutes but may not be as accurate as other flu tests. Rapid molecular assays are another flu test that detect the genetic material of the virus and can provide results in 15-20 minutes, according to the CDC. Like COVID tests, these two flu test types are typically administered through a nasal or throat swab. In addition to vaccination, hand-washing and face masks are critical to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, influenza, or other respiratory illnesses, Rose said. -By Julie Garcia Share this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Location.

Halfpoint Images / Getty ImagesSave this storySave this storySave this storySave this storyWe’re already in the midst of this year’s flu season, which means you may be researching flu vaccine side effects before you schedule your appointment—if you haven’t already gotten one.You might think, “But I’m healthy! Do I really need a flu vaccine?” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people over six months old really should get vaccinated to avoid the possibility of getting really sick. Flu vaccines aren’t 100% effective at preventing the flu, but they do reduce your chances of getting the flu and experiencing any related complications, such as pneumonia. Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at higher risk of developing serious complications from the flu, such as pregnant people, adults who are living with chronic health conditions, and those who are 65 and older, the CDC says.The flu vaccine also helps protect the people around you from getting sick, and the fewer people who get sick, the less the influenza virus circulates. Plus, you could get the flu and COVID-19 at the same time and need medical care. Right now, we want to do our best to avoid overwhelming our health care system while we’re still in the midst of a pandemic. For these reasons, medical experts strongly advise people to get vaccinated.“We have seen patients get both COVID-19 and the flu together, and they are quite ill for a while. It takes more time to bounce back,” Shilpi Agarwal, M.D., a board-certified primary care physician in Washington D.C. affiliated with Georgetown University Hospital, tells SELF. “I would absolutely recommend getting the flu vaccine because it can protect you and those around you.”Feel like you need just a tad more information before you’re ready to get vaccinated? We get it and have plenty more information for you. Keep reading for everything you need to know about this year’s flu vaccine, including side effects you might experience and how to deal with them.2021-2022 flu vaccine | Flu vaccine side effects | Can the vaccine make you sick? | Vaccine allergic reactions | COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine | Can I still get the vaccine? | How to manage side effectsWhat should I know about the 2021-2022 flu vaccine?For starters, it’s important to know that it’s highly recommended that you get vaccinated against the flu even though last year’s flu season was mild, thanks, in large part, to many people masking, staying indoors, and taking other preventive measures to avoid the spread of COVID-19.A minimal flu season last year doesn’t mean we’re in the clear this year. In fact, we’ve already seen flu outbreaks this flu season, such as the massive outbreak at the University of Michigan campus. Dr. Agarwal says there’s a possibility that outbreaks will continue throughout the flu season as people loosen up on illness-reducing behaviors like wearing face masks. And it’s important to remember that some people do end up with complications from the flu. (Roughly 380,000 people were hospitalized from the flu between 2019 and 2020, according to the CDC.)Flu viruses are always changing, so flu vaccine formulas are reviewed (and updated if necessary) every year to best protect people against the viruses that are predicted to cause the most illness, according to the CDC. All of the vaccines available for the 2021-2022 flu season, whether they’re via nasal or needle administration, protect against the same four flu viruses circulating heavily right now.According to the CDC, one vaccine isn’t any better than the other, but if you have any questions about whether one might be best for you, then it’s always safest to talk to your doctor.What are common flu vaccine side effects to expect?According to the CDC, you may experience short-lived, minor side effects of the flu shot or nasal spray vaccine—as is the case with any vaccination or medication. You might think that side effects are a bad thing, but they’re actually signs that your immune system is responding and getting ready to protect you.Here’s how it works: The flu shot contains inactivated (completely dead) or incomplete strains of the influenza virus, while the nasal spray contains live attenuated (weakened) strains. Neither form of the vaccine contains live flu viruses that can thrive in your body.“When you get any type of vaccine, the whole purpose is to expose your immune system to the virus,” infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells SELF. “Your immune system will start to rev up in response.” These dead, partial, and weakened viruses are enough to provoke your immune system to develop antibodies to guard you against live and threatening flu viruses. It usually takes about two weeks for those to kick in and offer you protection, per the CDC.Sometimes your immune system does this without causing noticeable symptoms, but other times, you’ll experience a few minor side effects as a result. Here are the most common ones you might experience:Soreness near the injection site: You might have a dull ache and some mild swelling due to inflammation in the area where you received your flu shot.Redness or swelling near the injection site: Your arm might be reddened and look larger or puffier than normal due to inflammation.Dizziness or fainting: Needles can be scary, and some people might become lightheaded or even faint due to anxiety or nerves about getting poked.Mild headache: A mild headache may set in the day of your flu shot. Like other side effects, this should let up within a couple of days.Fever: Some people have a mild, low-grade fever within the first 24 hours or so after getting their flu shot. (A low-grade fever is roughly 99.9 to 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.)Nausea: Feeling nauseous is another normal and common immune system response to the flu vaccine.Muscle aches: You might feel sore all around (similar to how you might feel after a new workout). Like headaches, muscle aches are a normal immune response to the flu vaccine and will be gone before you know it.Fatigue: You might feel really tired and like you need a nap, but that’s nothing to worry about since it’s one of those typical flu vaccine side effects.Coughing or sneezing after the nasal flu vaccine: This will be milder than if you had the flu and should only last for a couple of days.Sore throat after the nasal flu vaccine: This is generally mild, so it likely won’t be as painful as when you’re full-on sick.We said it above, but it’s really worth emphasizing: These side effects tend to be mild and last a few days at most, according to Jan Carney, M.D., M.P.H., associate dean for public health & health policy and professor of medicine at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont. But if you’re experiencing any worrisome symptoms that don’t resolve on their own within a few days, it’s a good idea to speak with a physician.Can the flu vaccine make you sick?Let’s just clear this up now: “You can’t get the flu from the flu vaccine,” Dr. Adalja says. Seriously, this is not a thing that is even remotely possible.However, in very rare cases, a flu vaccine can cause issues in people with pre-existing medical circumstances. The flu vaccine is safe for most people, but if you have any allergies, like to egg proteins or any other ingredients that could be in the vaccine, such as gelatin, it’s important to speak with your doctor or pharmacist before getting inoculated. “Those with an egg allergy can get the flu vaccine, but need to discuss with their doctor which specific vaccine is right for them,” Dr. Agarwal says.Overall, the CDC recommends speaking to a health care professional prior to getting a flu vaccine if you meet any of the following criteria:You’re allergic to eggs or any other potential vaccine ingredients, such as gelatin.You’ve ever had Guillain-Barré Syndrome (more on this below).You’ve had a severe allergic reaction to a previous flu vaccine.You’re not feeling well.How do I know if I’m having an allergic reaction to the flu vaccine?Severe or life-threatening allergic reactions to the flu vaccine are very rare. (One CDC report suggests there are 10 anaphylaxis reactions per 7.4 million doses of the inactivated version of the flu vaccine2.) When allergic reactions to the flu vaccine do occur, they happen within minutes to hours after getting the vaccine and are generally mild.Symptoms of an allergic reaction to the flu vaccine include:Skin that looks paler than normalSuddenly having reddened, swollen bumps or itchy hives on your skinFeeling your heartbeat get faster for no other apparent reasonsFeeling dizzy or lightheadedHaving trouble breathing, feeling hoarse, or wheezingFeeling super weakThese serious allergic reactions are rare, but again, it’s important to tell your primary care doctor and/or your pharmacist about any allergy you have just to be safe. “If you have a history of allergies, let your physician, nurse practitioner, or pharmacist know in advance,” Dr. Carney says. Typically, these more serious reactions occur in people who are allergic to an ingredient in the vaccine, such as egg protein.In a very, very small number of cases (just one or two cases for every million people who have been vaccinated), the vaccine can be associated with a rare illness called ​​Guillain-Barré syndrome, in which your immune system attacks nerves within the body. The disease causes muscle weakness and tingling (usually in the legs and feet first) so you could feel a pinprick sensation or notice that you feel unsteady when walking, according to the Mayo Clinic. But try not to let the fear of ​​Guillain-Barré deter you from getting your flu vaccine—the CDC notes that the risk of ​​​Guillain-Barré syndrome is far lower than the risk of having severe complications from the flu.Can you get the flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine or booster at the same time?“You can get a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine during the same visit, according to the CDC and based on extensive research with vaccines,” Dr. Carney says. “This gives people the opportunity to get vaccinated for both flu and COVID-19 at the same time, increasing their protection against both of these infections.”While there isn’t a ton of information or research available on getting the COVID-19 and flu vaccines at the same time, the CDC makes their recommendation based on research into how people react to other combinations of vaccines. It’s not clear if getting both vaccines at the same time will increase your chances of having side effects. Early research in the United Kingdom done of 670 adults shows that people who received their second COVID-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine at the same time were more likely to have local reactions, which includes side effects like arm pain and swelling near the injection site, compared to people who only got the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the November 2021 paper published in The Lancet2.Is it too late to get the flu vaccine for the 2021-2022 season?The CDC recommends getting vaccinated early in the season—ideally by the end of October.But it’s not too late to get a flu vaccine this year: Physicians say now is still a good time to get one. Flu cases typically rise in February and can continue into May. And since it takes about two weeks to build strong immunity post-vaccine, the sooner you get inoculated the better.Keep in mind: Since getting a flu vaccine is not a guarantee that you won’t get the flu, it’s important to continue to follow other public health best practices.“Everyone still needs to be mindful of things such as avoiding close contact with people who are sick, covering your nose and mouth when you sneeze—preferably with a tissue, so it can be discarded afterward—and using good hand hygiene, such as washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rubs, and avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth when possible,” Lee Nguyen, Pharm.D., associate clinical professor for the department of clinical pharmacy practice at the University of California, Irvine, tells SELF.If you’re interested in getting a flu vaccine, you can get one through your primary care physician if you have one, or another health care professional, as well as through many pharmacies and public health departments. Sometimes, flu vaccination clinics are set up in workplaces or other frequently visited locations within a community.How to treat flu vaccine side effects if you’re really strugglingAlthough side effects shouldn’t last long, there’s no shame in wanting to minimize your pain. To deal with any aches (like headaches and muscle pain) or a fever, you can try an OTC pain reliever such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, according to the Mayo Clinic. If your arm is really sore, consider icing it to help with inflammation. Getting plenty of sleep, loading up on water, and generally trying to take it easy until you feel a bit better is always a good idea, too.And if you have any questions about the flu vaccine—if and when you should get your flu shot or nasal spray vaccine, if you should be worried about side effects, concerns about allergies, or anything else—don’t hesitate to talk it over with a health care professional. They’re there to help you make the process as seamless as possible.Additional reporting by Korin MillerSources:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Flu Vaccine and People with Egg AllergiesThe Lancet, Safety and Immunogenicity of Concomitant Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines (ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2) With Seasonal Influenza Vaccines in Adults in the UKRelated:COVID-19 vs. the Flu: Here Are the Symptoms to Watch For9 Things to Know About Getting Your Flu Shot During the COVID-19 PandemicWhat Temperature Is Considered a Fever?

Moderna has announced the first positive interim data from the Phase I study of the company’s messenger RNA (mRNA) quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccine candidate, mRNA-1010. In the study, mRNA-1010 successfully boosted haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay geometric mean titres against all strains 29 days after vaccination at all doses tested in both younger and older adults. In the Phase I study, mRNA-1010 was evaluated at 50µg, 100µg and 200µg dose levels in younger adult (age 18-49) and older adult (age over 50) cohorts. No significant safety findings were observed through day 29. Adverse reactions (ARs) were generally reported more frequently in younger adults compared to older adults, and at higher dose levels. The most common solicited local ARs for both age groups included pain and axillary swellingenderness. The most common solicited systemic ARs for both age groups included fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia and headache.At the lowest dose level in younger adults, Day 29 geometric mean titres (GMT) against influenza A strains were 538 (H1N1) and 530 (H3N2); GMT against influenza B strains were 467 (B/Yamagata) and 261 (B/Victoria). Geometric mean fold-rises (GMFR) above baseline for influenza A strains were approximately 10-fold (H1N1) and eight-fold (H3N2), and approximately three-fold for B/Yamagata and two-fold for B/Victoria. Minimal dose response was observed between the 50µg, 100µg and 200µg dose levels, suggesting the potential to explore even lower doses.At the lowest dose level in older adults, Day 29 GMT against influenza A strains were 310 (H1N1) and 263 (H3N2); GMT against influenza B strains were 305 (B/Yamagata) and 215 (B/Victoria). GMFR for influenza A strains were approximately six-fold (H1N1) and 6-fold (H3N2), and approximately three-fold for B/Yamagata and two-fold for B/Victoria. Minimal dose response was observed between the 50µg, 100µg and 200µg dose levels.“The positive interim results from our Phase I quadrivalent flu vaccine candidate, mRNA-1010, are an important milestone toward achieving that goal,” commented Moderna’s Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel. “It is encouraging to see that participants in the study who received the 50µg dose, including older adults, achieved robust increases in geometric mean antibody titres against H1N1 and H3N2, the strains responsible for the vast majority of morbidity and mortality in this age group.”Moderna also announced that the Phase II study of mRNA-1010 is now fully enrolled and preparation for the Phase III study is underway. Moderna also provided an update on its seasonal flu vaccine program including the announcement of two beyond quadrivalent seasonal flu development candidates (mRNA-1011 and mRNA-1012).EMA initiates rolling review of Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine (VLA2001)…Related topicsBig Pharma, Biopharmaceuticals, Clinical Trials, Data Analysis, Dosage, Drug Safety, mRNA, VaccinesRelated organisationsModernaRelated drugsmRNA-1010Related peopleStéphane BancelRelated diseases & conditionsflu By Anna Begley (European Pharmaceutical Review)14 December 2021No comments yetShares4 Share via Pinterest Reddit Buffer Xing WhatsApp FlipboardRelated topicsBig Pharma, Biopharmaceuticals, Clinical Trials, Data Analysis, Dosage, Drug Safety, mRNA, VaccinesRelated organisationsModernaRelated drugsmRNA-1010Related peopleStéphane BancelRelated diseases & conditionsflu Most popular...First-of-a-kind EU approval granted for eosinophilic esophagitis medicineEncouraging data revealed for schizophrenia long-acting injectablesFinal Chapter text published for early adoptionSingle-use bioreactor market to witness favourable expansion to 2030Innovative static culturing method developed Read the latest issueAll subscriptions include online membership, giving you access to the journal and exclusive content.

By year’s end, COVID-19 vaccines based on snippets of mRNA, or messenger RNA, proved to be safe and incredibly effective at preventing the worst outcomes of the disease. mRNA vaccines tell our cells how to make a mimic of a viral protein, in this case the spike protein that the coronavirus uses to break into cells (SN Online: 12/16/21). The vaccine-generated protein then teaches the immune system what the real threat looks like should it later encounter that threat. For decades, efforts to develop mRNA-based vaccines to fight infectious diseases like rabies have been on a slow and meandering road (SN Online: 6/29/21). But the urgency of the pandemic breathed new life into these attempts. The promise of mRNA technology now takes us well past this pandemic’s horizon. “We’re right at the beginning of a really exciting time,” says Anna Blakney, a bioengineer who studies RNA technology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. The dreams are big: Fighting all sorts of infections. Attacking cancer cells. Restoring specific proteins to treat genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. “It’s a really amazing technology that’s been proven over the past year,” Blakney says. But it won’t be a panacea, she cautions. “It works really well for some things. It’s unknown how well it will work for other things.” Those answers might come soon. Here’s a look at four research efforts that have been aided by the swift momentum for mRNA vaccines that COVID-19 generated. Influenza Our current flu vaccines aren’t so hot. In a given year, flu shots are between 40 percent and 60 percent effective at preventing the disease. mRNA might do better. Pfizer has begun enrolling about 600 people ages 65 to 85 to find out how mRNA vaccines stack up against traditional flu shots. Moderna has already dosed participants in its own trial of such a flu vaccine, slated to include 180 adults in the United States. HIV HIV is a slippery foe, able to evade the immune system by quickly mutating and disguising itself in a coat of human proteins and sugars (SN: 7/3/21 & 7/17/21, p. 14). But mRNA vaccines may be able to train the body’s immune system to detect HIV in its many permutations. That’s the premise of a new clinical trial in the works, sponsored by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and including scientists from Moderna. Zika virus There are no vaccines available to protect people against Zika virus, which can cause severe disabilities in children born to infected mothers (SN Online: 8/7/18). Scientists from Moderna are currently recruiting 800 adults for a clinical trial testing an mRNA vaccine for its safety and ability to prevent Zika infection. CMV (cytomegalovirus) CMV is a common and usually harmless virus. But it can be dangerous for newborn babies who get CMV from an infected mother before they are born. An early infection can lead to premature birth, hearing loss, seizures and developmental delays. Moderna has begun testing a CMV vaccine candidate — a combination of six different mRNAs that carry instructions for proteins on the surface of CMV. The clinical trial will include nearly 7,000 people. Questions or comments on this article?

The views expressed are those of the author(s) and reviewer(s) at the time of publication. Young people are thought to drive the spread of seasonal influenza (flu) while rarely becoming seriously ill themselves. A computer model developed before the pandemic showed the benefits of including teenagers in the vaccination programme. The model found that giving flu vaccines to 2 – 20 year olds cost less than vaccinating people over 65 and prevented a higher burden of disease in the population. It found that this approach reduced the spread of the virus and protected those who do not have immunity. Before the pandemic, children aged 2 – 11 years were routinely offered vaccination in order to reduce the spread of flu. This was along with adults who are at risk of becoming seriously ill with flu because they are over 65, pregnant or have a long-term condition such as asthma, heart disease or diabetes. This flu season could be exceptional with more people than usual catching flu because social distancing has meant they have not built up natural immunity. In addition, anyone who has flu and COVID-19 at the same time is more likely to become seriously ill. As a temporary measure therefore, young people aged 12 - 16 are being included in the programme this winter. People aged 50 - 65 years are also now included. Unlike previous models, this model included data on people over a number of flu seasons. This means it took into account the immunity that people built up in previous years. The research suggests that vaccinating 11 – 20 year olds is a good use of healthcare resources. Flu vaccines are given every year and the programme is expensive. NHS policymakers have to decide how to use finite resources in the most cost-effective way. Findings from this study are being used to inform flu vaccination policy. Further information on flu vaccination is available on the NHS website. What’s the issue? In the UK, flu outbreaks occur most often in the winter, peaking between January and March. Typical symptoms are high temperature, aches and fatigue but the illness can result in life-threatening complications such as pneumonia. Before the pandemic, flu caused one in ten hospital admissions for respiratory problems and deaths in the UK. Most people who die from flu are over the age of 65. New strains of flu are constantly emerging. A new vaccine is produced every year to protect people from the dominant strain. The NHS offers free vaccination to people at high risk of becoming seriously ill with flu. Before 2020, this included people over 65, pregnant women, people in long-term residential care, and those with some health conditions. Flu vaccination has been offered to children aged between 2 – 11 years since 2013. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the over 50s and children aged 11 – 16 years are currently being offered a flu vaccine. The aim is to reduce the burden on the NHS at a time when hospitals continue to deal with COVID-19 patients. But vaccinating huge numbers of people every year is costly and time-consuming for the NHS. Policymakers must decide how to protect the population against flu in the most cost-effective way. Computer models based on health data can help work out the best vaccination strategy. But most previous models have considered each flu season and each strain separately. This means they could not take account of how infection or vaccination in previous years changes a person’s risk in the future. By contrast, this model includes data about immunity built up in previous flu seasons and looks at its impact in later years. What’s new? The model was developed as part of the Mathematical and Economic Modelling for Vaccination and Immunisation Evaluation (MEMVIE) project. Researchers reconstructed the way that flu spread in several flu seasons (2009 – 2018) by including information about peoples’ infection and vaccination history. They used data which represented all sectors of the population in England. It came from databases on GP consultations, national reports on flu (from Public Health England, now known as UK Health Security Agency) and information on the circulating strain (from FluNet). The research team used their model to explore what would happen if flu vaccination was offered to different groups of people. They looked at 1,375 different vaccination strategies, offering vaccines to various age groups. They estimated the effect of vaccinating younger people at low risk of complications, as well as to those at high risk. They compared each strategy to only vaccinating people at risk. Using the model, they assessed the cost-effectiveness of extending the flu vaccination programme. They considered the effect of vaccinating different age groups who were at low risk of developing complications from flu. The results suggested that vaccinating low-risk children and young people aged 2 - 20 is a highly cost-effective way of tackling seasonal flu. Vaccinating healthy people over 65 (the current approach) is cost-effective, but vaccinating 2 – 20 year olds, even more so. The research shows the benefits of vaccinating the under 20s in addition to those at risk (people over 65, pregnant women, people in long-term residential care, and those with some health conditions). Why is this important? Because of the pandemic, the flu vaccination programme has been expanded to include young people aged 12 - 16, and older people aged 50 - 65 years. This study was carried out before the pandemic but it supports the move to vaccinate teenagers. It found that vaccinating children and young people aged 2 – 20 costs less than vaccinating people over 65 and may prevent a higher burden of disease in the population. This is probably because young people drive flu transmission. Young adults tend to have contact with a broad range and large number of people whom they could transmit a flu infection to. Some young adults are also parents of young children and are at risk of contracting illnesses from close contact with them. Vaccinating low-risk children and young people aged 2 – 20 (in addition to people at risk) is likely to contribute to herd immunity across the whole population. Herd immunity occurs when enough people are immune to an infection to curb its spread. This fall in transmission then protects people who are not immune. What’s next? Findings from this study are being used to inform flu vaccination policy in the UK. The research team worked in collaboration with the Department of Health and Social Care to ensure their modelling met their needs. The research has also been used by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in their discussions on flu vaccination. Social distancing measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic curbed the circulation of flu in 2020. As flu infections have been so low, peoples’ immunity to flu may have waned. As a result, this winter’s flu season (2021-22) is likely to be more severe than usual. More research is needed to understand how flu and COVID-19 infections impact upon each other.

Share via: Comments Study author “In future, we would like to explore how recent disruptions in flu circulation and infection due to COVID-19 lockdowns affect the different vaccination strategies simulated by our model. There has been very low flu activity globally in the past 18 months, which may impact the amount of immunity in the population to flu viruses in circulation in future years. Here in the UK, it is highly likely that we will see a more severe influenza peak than we would otherwise have expected in the upcoming flu season. There is a great amount of uncertainty about SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) and how it interacts with other respiratory infections such as flu. Is infection by SARS-CoV-2 blocking the spread of other viruses? Or can infection with either SARS-CoV-2 or flu make it more likely a person is infected with the other virus? Our ideas and understanding will continue to be modified as new information on this outbreak is accumulated.” Edward Hill, Research Fellow, Zeeman Institute for Systems Biology & Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research, University of Warwick Researcher “This study improves on previous models of seasonal influenza vaccination that have informed policy; it takes account of immunity that could build up between each influenza season. All models come with a level of uncertainty. This one follows the English population for a small number of seasons and, ideally, a model would both follow the population for longer and take genetic changes in influenza strains into account. But that would require greater scientific understanding of how this occurs and a far more complex model. The findings from this paper confirm that the current paediatric vaccination programme in England saves lives and is likely to be a good investment. This should encourage public health and healthcare professionals, children, and their caregivers, to continue improving uptake of the programme.” Mark Jit, Professor of Vaccine Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Read more about public health Artificial intelligence: 10 promising interventions for healthcare Collection | 28.07.23 Stressing the personal benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine could encourage more ...

To effectively control the spread of disease, it is essential that the contact structure via those movements among farms is thoroughly explored. However, few attempts have been made to scrutinize PPHaV movement compared to poultry trade. Therefore, our study aimed to elucidate the role of PPHaV movement on HPAI transmission. We performed network analysis using PPHaV movement data based on a global positioning system, with phylogenetic information of the isolates during the 2016–2017 HPAI H5N6 epidemic in the Republic of Korea. Moreover, the contribution of PPHaV movement to the spread of HPAI was estimated by Bayesian modeling. The network analysis revealed that there was the relationship between phylogenetic clusters and the contact network via PPHaV movement. Furthermore, the similarity of farm poultry species and the shared integrators between inter-linked infected premises (IPs) were associated with ties within the same phylogenetic clusters. Additionally, PPHaV movement among phylogenetically clustered IPs was estimated to contribute to approximately 30% of HPAI H5N6 infections in IPs on average. This study provides insight into how HPAI spread via PPHaV movement and scientific basis for control strategies.

This is true for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) disease at poultry holdings. HPAI is a viral notifiable infectious disease (per World Organisation for Animal Health) with a high mortality rate in chickens. It commonly spreads through contact between an infectious and susceptible hosts. Indeed, an increasing number of HPAI virus (HPAIV) infections have been reported at poultry facilities globally, in part due to increased intensification and complexity of interactions despite enormous efforts to eliminate and prevent the disease worldwide1.To effectively prevent and control the spread of HPAIV, understanding the contact structure between different poultry holdings at risk is essential. For example, poutlry transport between farms are potential spreads of HPAIV. Additionally, indirect contact with fomites through vehicle movement associated with production and health, such as feed trucks and egg transporters visiting IPs, could spread infections between farms2.Recently, many studies have identified the role of animal movement in transmitting a pathogen between livestock farms using network analysis. Previous network studies have identified a relationship between contact properties of poultry farms and HPAI occurrence by comparing network metrics; for example infected premises were more likely to have a higher degree of centrality and betweenness centrality3,4. More recently, one study introduced a permutation approach to evaluate the intermediary role of a particular link or node in the contact network on the spread of pathogen on a community level5. These studies have provided important knowledge on the effect of contact structure between farms on HPAI spread.However, despite the importance of understanding transmission chains via vehicle movement, epidemiological studies on the impact of vehicle movement IPs and susceptible premises remains scarce, mainly owing to a lack of corresponding data. With the aim of tracing epidemiological links to allocate biosecurity and surveillance resources6, the Republic of Korea (ROK) has started mandatory registration regulations for all vehicles visiting livestock productions for production and health-associated duties since 2014, which are attached to a global positioning system (GPS) to prevent and control infectious disease. Up to date, 18 kinds of livestock vehicles such as feed trucks, livestock transporter trucks, livestock manure hauling trucks, and egg delivery trucks transmit every farm visiting record to the Korea Animal Health Integrated System (KAHIS). With the real-time movement tracking data, it is possible to estimate the model for the spread of HPAIV between farms due to vehicle movement. This will contribute to our understanding of HPAI transmission among poultry farms and therefore improve the efficiency of intervention resource allocation to poultry productions.Additionally, as the HPAIV undergoes an evolutionary genetic change during the course of an outbreak, phylogenetically different genotypes of the virus can be isolated from infected hosts (about 91.5–94.1%, for homologies of the PA gene, 96.7–97.3% for homologies of the NS genes among the five genotype groups)7. Therefore, phylogenetic clustering information on IPs can be used to infer more accurate transmission dynamics between poultry holdings8.Hence, this study aimed to elucidate the transmission dynamics of HPAI H5N6 via poultry production and health-associated vehicle (PPHaV) movement by integrating GPS tracking data and phylogenetic information during the 2016–2017 HPAI H5N6 epidemic in the ROK. First, we extracted potentially contaminating vehicle movements based on various temporal assumptions on the infectious duration of IPs and PPHaV movements. Subsequently, an inter-farm contact network was constructed based on those movements and phylogenetic information. We conducted a network analysis to elicit the association between the HPAI H5N6 transmission chain and PPHaV movements. Second, we quantified the contribution of PPHaV movements on HPAI H5N6 occurrence in IPs and the length of time for infectious duration followed by a permutation test to evaluate distinctive characteristics of contact networks among IPs with the same genotype virus infection. This study provides novel insight on the dynamics of inter-farm spread via a diverse range of vehicle movements and a scientific basis for HPAI control strategies including movement restriction and standstill.ResultsNetwork with all genotypes of IPsTo examine the rate at which HPAI H5N6 transmission between poultry farms is driven PPHaV movement, we used a network metric named assortativity. This denotes how likely IPs with the same genotype of HPAI H5N6 are to be connected to each other. We measured this indicator on the contact network built with tie formations via PPHaV movement using the different temporal infectious duration assumption for vehicle and IPs.Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of networks composed of all genotypes of IPs grounded on the different temporal assumptions of the infectious duration for IPs (i.e., seven days, 14 days, 21 days) and PPHaV movements (i.e., one day and three days). The counts of nodes comprising the network tended to increase as the infectious period for PPHaV increased from one day to three days and as the infectious durations for IPs increased. For example, the number of IPs as nodes increased from 80 during the seven-day infectious duration of IPs to 130 during the twenty-one-day infectious duration of IPs with a one-day infectious period for PPHaV movement; this increased further to 195 during the twenty-one-day infectious duration of IPs with a three-day infectious period for PPHaV movement. The farm species and genotype composition of IPs in each network were relatively comparable in all scenarios.Chicken, duck , and quail farms accounted for 57.4%, 41.1%, and 1.4% of IPs as nodesThe different genotypes C2, C3, C4, and C5 accounted for 26.8%, 19.1%, 46.0%, and 8.1% of IPs.Table 1 Overview of the characteristics of the contact networks between all HPAI H5N6 genotypes of infected premises.Full size tableFor the assortativity of six contact networks based on the genotype of IPs, all had more than about 0.53, which indicated the tendency to connect IPs with other IPs having the same genotype HPAIV via potential contaminating vehicle movement. The assortativity was generally higher in the network built with an infectious duration of one day for PPHaV movements than in the network that used the three-day assumption. More specifically, the contact networks built simulated using a seven-day infectious duration for IPs and a one-day duration for PPHaV movement showed the highest assortativity by genotype. This implies that the contact structure made by a more temporary potential contaminating vehicle movement between IPs having a shorter infectious period was more cohesive and likely to be the possible transmission chain of the HPAIV H5N6. Indeed, the majority of the same genotype of IPs were directly or closely interconnected with each other, while a few were connected with other genotypes of IPs, as shown in Fig. 1.Figure 1Graphical representation of networks consisting of all infected premises (IPs), constructed by under different temporal assumption on infectious duration for IPs and poultry production and health associated vehicle (PPHaV) movements. Each of figures represent the contact network between IPs, under the different infectious duration for IPs and vehicle movement. The plots in the top row display one day infectious duration for vehicle movement with seven days infectious duration for IPs (top left), 14 days duration (top middle), and 21 days duration for IPs (top right). The plots in the bottom rows depict three days duration for vehicle movement with seven days infectious duration for IPs (bottom left), 14 days duration (bottom middle), and 21 days duration for IPs (bottom right). Colored dot denotes specific genotype IPs; red for C2, blue for C3, yellow for C4 and green for C5.Full size imageAdditionally, we performed logistic regression quadratic assignment permutation (LR-QAP) analysis to identify factors contributing to tie formation between the interlinked two IPs with the same genotype of HPAI H5N6 infection via PPHaV movement. Table 2 provides the results of the LR-QAP analysis of the association between tie formation among the same genetic group of IPs and dyadic explanatory variables (i.e., pairwise variables between two interlinked infected premises) with different temporal assumptions for the contagious period for IPs and PPHaVs. Overall, coefficient estimates exhibited a significant positive association among the similarity of farm species (minimum[min]-maximum[max], 6.57 to 9.25), shared poultry integrators (min–max, 0.98 to 2.15), and tie presence. In contrast, the geographical distance of dyadic nodes, Euclidean distance between interlinked infected premises measured as a continuous scale, was significantly inverse associated with it (min–max, − 0.06 to − 0.01) except for one network with a seven-day infectious duration for IPs and PPHaVs. In other words, given that both poultry integrator and farm species between interlinked infected premises via vehicle movements are the same, the estimated probability of a tie formation between HPAI H5N6 virus-infected premises for a 1 km increase in geographical distance between two farms reduced. LQ-QAP analysis showed the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC) value for seven-day infectious periods for IPs and one-day periods for PPHaVs.Table 2 Association between three dyadic explanatory variables and a tie formation between the same genotype IPs under the different infectious duration for infected premises and vehicle movements using logistic regression quadratic assignment procedure (LQ-QAR).Full size tableBayesian inferenceTo estimate the contribution of vehicle movements originating from 259 HPAI H5N6 virus IPs of 343 IPs to spreading HPAI H5N6 virus, we conducted Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters associated with the force of infection of vehicle movements and other factors. Table 3 summarizes the estimated contribution rate of introducing a specific genetic type of HPAIV H5N6 to an individual farm via PPHaV movements originating from another IP or other sources of infections through the simulation using the force of infection parameters previously estimated by Bayesian inference. The posterior parameters for force of HPAI H5N6 infection due to one contaminating PPHaV entry coming from IPs was estimated to differ with the infectious periods of the genotype of IPs and vehicle movement (see Supplementary Table S3 and Fig S2–S3 online). The deviance information criterion (DIC) was decreased in the model employing a three-day infectious duration for vehicle movements except in the case of C3-genotype HPAIV H5N6 infection, where the one-day infectious duration model was preferred (see Supplementary Table S3 online).Table 3 Contribution rate of potentially contaminating vehicle movement and other sources of HPAI H5N6 infection at infected premises that belong to each phylogenetic cluster.Full size tableOverall, 259 IPs (75.5% of all IPs) with both a visit log for GPS-equipped vehicles and phylogenetic classification information and 6,280 non-IPs were used to estimate the contribution of potentially contaminating movements to HPAI H5N6 transmission between poultry premises. Apparently, 38.7% of IPs that had visiting records from registered vehicles were directly interlinked with other IPs. The proportion of HPAI H5N6 spread via potentially contaminating vehicle movement differed with the genotype of IPs related to potentially contaminated vehicle movement in preferred models. On average, 28.3% of 259 IPs were transmitted HPAIV H5N6 via PPHaV movement in which 13.7% of interconnection occurred between IPs and 86.3% of links occurred between IPs and non-IPs, whereas 71.7% of 259 IPs were given HPAIV H5N6 by other sources. When C4-genotype IPs were associated with potentially contaminated vehicle movement, 46.0% of IPs had an infection with three-day infectious PPHaV entries; in contrast, 31.7% of poultry holdings had an infection via C3-genotype IPs associated with potentially contaminated vehicle movement that were presumed to transfer virus for one days. Moreover, the IPs origin vehicle movement that stayed infectious for three days were attributed to HPAI H5N6 infection for 23.5% of C2-genotype of IPs and 11.8% of C5-genotype of IPs. In addition, the interval between infection and reporting or sampling was estimated to be 5.91 days (5.89 days in the C2 IPs, 5.98 days in the C3 IPs, and 5.87 days in the C4 IPs).Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2, there were spatially heterogeneous contact patterns between the same genotype of IPs via vehicle movements. A majority of contacts were established in the central part of the country via PPHaV movements between infected poultry holdings at a close distance. The long-range contacts were only present in the C4 genotype of IPs, located in the northern, central, and southern parts of the country, were interconnected via PPHaV movements.Figure 2The geographical contact network between the same HPAI H5N6 genotype of infected premises (IPs) constructed under temporal infectious duration of IPs and vehicle movement based on Bayesian inference; C2(top left), C3(top right), C4(bottom left) and C5(bottom right). Blue dot denotes a duck farm, red dot points out a chicken farm and brown dot represents quail farm. The color of edges represented an individual vehicle movement.Full size imageGenotype-specific network based on Bayesian inferenceTo explore contact properties relative to HPAI transmission via IPs origin vehicle movements, we examined six contact properties on the simulated contact network composed of only the same genotype IPs based on the parameter estimates from Bayesian inference: diameter (the shortest distance between the two most distant nodes in the network), average path length (the number of ties along the shortest length of the tie between two nodes), density (the proportion of edges that exist in a network), reciprocity (the proportion of IPs in a directed network to be mutually linked), assortativity, and transitivity (the ratio between the observed closed triplets and the maximum possible number of closed triplets in the network). Table 4 describes the results of the permutation analysis on the contact network between the same genotype of IPs constructed by potentially contaminating vehicle movement originating from IPs with infectious duration based on the Bayesian inference results. Each of the three networks had different compositions of chicken farms and domestic duck farms. For instance, C2 and C3 genotype-based networks had a high proportion of chicken farms: 100% of IPs raised chickens in the C3 genotype-based network, and 78.9% of IPs were domestic chicken farms in the C2 genotype-based network whilst the chicken holdings in the C4 genotype-based network accounted for 26.9% of IPs.Table 4 Permutation test of contact network structure metrics between the same genotype of HPAI H5N6 virus infected premises linked via vehicle movements based on the Bayesian parameter estimation.Full size tableThe three networks were commonly characterized by a significantly short average path length and high reciprocity. In contrast, the reciprocity, assortativity by degree, and transitivity showed different patterns in the three networks (see Supplementary Figs S8–S10 online). More specifically, the C3 genotype-based network, which was solely composed of chicken farms, had a significantly high assortativity by degree (median difference between the observed value and 1,000 simulated values [MD], 0.634; 5–95% percentile range of difference [5–95 PCTL], 0.315–1.094). In contrast, the contact network between the C2 genotype of IPs and C4 genotype of IPs, consisting of domestic duck and chicken farms, exhibited significant high transitivity; the median of transitivity and reciprocity were 0.600 (5–95 PCTL, 0.284–0.600) in the network with C2 genotype IPs and 0.301 (5–95 PCTL, 0.229–0.333) in the network with C4 genotype IPs.DiscussionHPAI virus generally spreads through effective contact between a contagious host and a susceptible one. The primary type of contact between poultry holdings is via animal trade and vehicle movement engaging in poultry production and health tasks. Recently, many studies have identified the role of animal movement in transmitting a pathogen between livestock farms. However, very less attention has been paid to examine the association of vehicle movement, such as that of feed trucks and egg transporters. Furthermore, none of the studies have incorporated phylogenetic information for the more reliable estimation of the contributions of vehicle movement between infected premises on viral diffusion. Therefore, this study aimed to provides better understanding of the transmission dynamics of HPAIV H5N6 via vehicle movement and a scientific basis for animal health authorities to refine countermeasures including customized standstills and movement control. In this study, we used PPHaV movement data and phylogenetic classification information to elucidate the role of PPHaV movement on inter-farm transmission of HPAI H5N6 and to understand the structural properties of contact networks among IPs.In the network analysis on contact structure via PPHaV movement among all HPAI H5N6 genotypes of IPs, we first identified a higher preference of bonds between the same phylogenetic group of IPs rather than a connection between different genotypes of IPs. This finding suggests that there is a correlation between the interconnection of the same genotype of IPs and PPHaV movement that potentially spreads the virus through the network. This emphasizes the importance of epidemiological tracing utilizing vehicle tracking data that elucidate effective surveillance and preventive actions.Moreover, when tracing epidemiological linkages to search for potentially high-risk IPs and farms, animal health authorities should consider the various lengths of time for tracing to harness the efficiency of biosecurity resource allocation. Under current standard operating procedures (SOP) for responding to HPAI outbreaks in the ROK, all poultry farms that PPHaVs have visited after entering an IP during the 21 days prior to the reporting date are obliged to take tests and undergo poultry movement restriction. Although the authorities are responsible for minimizing the possibility of poultry farms being infected by vehicle movement from IPs to eliminate epidemics rapidly, prioritizing biosecurity and surveillance targets is important, especially in the acceleration phase of the epidemic.In permutation analysis of all the IP networks, similarities of farm poultry species, shared poultry integrators, and closer geographical distance between dyadic interlinked IPs were identified as contributing factors to building potential transmission routes. Over the last decade, poultry integrators have been profoundly rooted in the poultry production system in the ROK. According to the monthly reports from the Korean Poultry Association9, approximately 90% of meat duck farms and 91% of meat chicken farms contracted with integrators; these farms share production chains such as feed suppliers, chick sources, and duck slaughtering plants. In addition, poultry production-associated vehicles, such as feed trucks and manure haulers, are generally responsible for farms in certain areas. Therefore, the poultry holdings in proximity are more likely to be interconnected by those shared vehicles (see Supplementary Fig S11 online). The consistency of farm poultry species between IPs seems to be a fundamental driver of tie formations because most PPHaVs can be separately operated by the type of poultry species at the farms they visit mainly due to structural differences in car design and supply lines of resources4. This implies that targeted standstill of poultry holdings located at an adjacent distance that raise the same species and are operated by the same poultry integrator of IPs could effectively reduce further spread through the networks.Using Bayesian inference, the HPAI H5N6 virus were likely to introduce 28.3% (minimum–maximum, 11.8%–46.0%) of IPs via possible infectious vehicle movements originating from the same phylogenetically clustered IPs. This could be explained by the finding in the permutation test on network structure metrics. The three contact networks between the same genotype IPs depicted significantly high cohesive connection structure, such as high transitivity, reciprocity and low average path length which is suitable for disease transmission via vehicle movements. This means if one poultry holding have infection and continue to production without early detection, rest of other premises are easily affected by through the network around an IP. Furthermore, the contact structure is potentially correlated with the composition ratio of poultry holdings and the geographical distance between them. For instance, the C3 genotype-based networks consisting only of chicken farms exhibited increased reciprocity pertaining to PPHaVs that had repetitively visited two paired chicken farms showed higher reciprocity than species heterogenous network. This indicated that the contacts between IPs tended to be direct farm-to-farm contacts rather than overlaid interactions between farms via vehicle movement. In contrast, the C2 genotype-based contact network that included chicken and duck farms located in neighboring regions had high transitivity and reciprocity. High transitivity means that if one poultry holding has an HPAIV H5N6 infection and continues to produce without detection, other interlinked premises are easily affected by an IP. In this type of relationship, inter-farm transmission of HPAI H5N6 could be prevented by enhancing on-farm biosecurity practices for PPHaVs and exterior personnel.As states in the epidemiological report for the HPAI epidemic in ROK10, HPAI viruses were isolates from samples of shoes, vehicles, and entry ground in the infected premises. This indicated that the shoes of the driver of vehicles were likely to be contaminated. This suggests the transmission between infected premises through indirect contact with farmworkers and poultry. This is supported by a previous study showing that the disinfection of personnel visiting farms reduced the risk of Avian influenza infection in poultry farms11. In this context, drivers and poultry producers moving around poultry productions should implement stricter disinfection protocols, including disinfection after cleaning removes dirt, dust with longer contact time on both the vehicle itself and the equipment such as shoes and clothes.Besides, the common types of vehicles observed in the three networks were feed trucks and egg transporters (Table 5). Interestingly, the proportion of egg transporters (7.1–17.1%) that could be involved in potentially infectious routes was pronounced compared to its proportion of the total number of registered PPHaV (4.4%) as of March 2019. Egg transporters enter inside layer farms to load many eggs almost on a daily basis. During the process of loading eggs, egg transporters are prone to direct contact with farm workers, especially in small-scale businesses. Furthermore, the risk of HPAI H5N6 infection can increased by transporting egg trays used to remove eggs during an epizootic12. Therefore, egg delivery vehicles and personnel are more likely to be contaminated with viruses when the premise is infected. In addition, the length of the interval between the infected and reporting dates is parallel to the duration when the highest assortativity value occurred. The temporal interval between the infected and reporting or sampling dates was estimated to be 5.91 days on average. In practice, disease detection speed on poultry holdings seems to be a condition that depends on the intensity of nationwide surveillance and participation in a voluntary notification. During the 2016–17 HPAI H5N6 epidemic, mandatory testing was proactively implemented in the ROK. As a result, approximately 45% of all infected duck holdings were screened by surveillance. Furthermore, three standstills at the national level or on a broader scale were imposed by an animal health authority. As shown in Fig. 3, the number of tie formations via IP origin PPHaV movements dramatically decreased after a standstill that ordered all PPHaV drivers to initiate disinfection protocols. Thus, a control strategy could result in decreased infectious duration of the vehicle contaminated by fomites.Table 5 Summary of the type of vehicle interconnecting between the same HPAI H5N6 virus genotype of infected premises based on Bayesian parameter inference results.Full size tableFigure 3The temporal trends of tie formations with HPAI H5N6 infected premises (IPs) via potentially contaminating vehicle movement that was presumed to infectious duration of one day; C2(top left), C3(top right), C4(bottom left) and C5(bottom right). Red dashed vertical lines represent the period of standstills; First standstill was enforced on ten municipalities starting from November 28th, 2016 to November 29th, 2016. Second one was nationwide from December 13rd, 2016 to December 14th, 2016 and third one was applied to three municipalities from February 28th, 2016 to March 1st, 2017 (time unit: day).Full size imageThis study has several limitations. First, we did not account for the risk variance based on the type of vehicles interconnecting between two IPs because of the absence of exact specifications about the purpose of their visits to farms; this was not enough information to estimate parameters relative to the force of infection. In principle, the risk of contamination with HPAI H5N6 differs by the type of vehicle. For instance, bulk feed trucks regularly undergo disinfection procedures after unloading and loading the feedstuff at the feed factory and are unlikely to have direct contact with poultry, while poultry transporters are likely to have direct contact with poultry. Moreover, although we reported the counts of different types of vehicle movements engaged in potential transmission routes to intuitively evaluate the size of the impact of each vehicle, gauging the variance of the contribution of individual types of vehicles to HPAI H5N6 infection at poultry farms is necessary. Furthermore, the variability of other factors including the duration of contamination and underlying risk associated with contact with poultry should be evaluated in a future study. Second, the vehicle movements in our analysis did not encompass all types of vehicles, such as personal owner vehicles, moving around poultry holdings because of privacy issues. Furthermore, there could be missing data of movements, such as broken GPS devices or other reasons. Third, we did not consider the on-farm biosecurity level, which might affect the contribution of vehicle movement to HPAI H5N6 transmission. The risk of a vehicle transmitting the virus likely depends on whether a disinfection procedure was performed. For example, the force of infection is variable between the following two situations: when a vehicle visits a farm after visiting an IP and when a vehicle visits a farm after other farms. Therefore, the extra parameters to reflect the on-farm biosecurity level would be incorporated to more robust estimation of force of infection given by IP origin vehicle entries. Lastly, even though the phylogenetic cluster information used in the study can distinguish and separate the inter-farm transmission linkage among the same genotype of IPs, which was the essential assumption on the network analysis and Bayesian inference, it had the limitation of ruling out completely indirect transmission between IPs. For instance, if one IP had a direct connection with another IP of the same phylogenetic clustering group via vehicle movements, which turned out to connect with different IP genetically directly, the force of infection estimated in the first place would be misleading thus should be excluded. Thus, an alternative approach to incorporating genetic data, including genetic distance from the whole genome sequence of isolates, is needed to attempt future works.During the 2016–2017 Korean epidemic, although the length of time from infection to reporting was estimated to be short and several movement stand-still periods were enforced, a large number of vehicles visited IPs during their estimated infection period and could have disperse HPAIV H5N6 to other farms. Moreover, our study demonstrated the presence of long-range viral transfer between IPs via vehicle movements. PPHaVs were required by the regulation to be disinfected at multiple sites during the epidemic in addition to routine cleaning and disinfection procedures at the farm entrance. Our findings suggest that such disinfection procedures may not have been sufficient, possibly due to the tighten interconnection between farms. Therefore, effective restrictions on vehicle movements and risk-based surveillance need to be imposed through evaluation on the underlying contact network between poultry holdings.This study firstly demonstrated the contribution of poultry production and health associated vehicle movement to spread HPAIV H5N6 among poultry holdings and underscore the understanding of the contact network that could minimize destructive consequence by providing the essential information about those restrictions to be targeted to premises and risk based active surveillance. It is recommended that an animal health authority should analyze the real-time vehicle movement data to assess the poultry holdings at risk and prevent the further spread.MethodsHPAI outbreak dataAccording to the terrestrial manual 2018 of the World Organisation for Animal Health Organization (OIE)13, HPAI H5N6 virus infection at a poultry holding was diagnosed by the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test under the active surveillance where the test positive was regarded as viral infection. During the 2016–17 HPAI H5N6 epidemic (from November 16, 2016, to March 3, 2017), the veterinary services conducted a proactive surveillance program in which all duck holdings had to be tested for HPAI H5N6 infection, and chicken holdings received visual inspection every week.HPAI H5N6 outbreak data contained geographical location, flock size, farm species, contracted integrator, date of HPAIV sampling or reporting, and start and end date of culling for 343 HPAI H5N6 virus-IPs. Moreover, phylogenetic cluster information from a previous study was added to the abovementioned information for each IP14,15. In fact, during the 2016–17 HPAI H5N6 epidemic, the H5N6 viruses isolated from poultry farms and wild birds were classified into five distinct phylogenetic clusters (cluster 1 to cluster 5) according to previous studies7,14,15. The phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the whole genome sequence of isolates sampled from HPAI positive poultry. Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were constructed using nucleotide substitution models (Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model with a gamma (γ)-distribution for HA and NP; general time-reversible model with a γ-distribution for PB2, PB1, PA, and NA; Kimura 2-parameter model with a γ-distribution for M; Tamura 3-parameter model with a γ-distribution for NS). The phylogenetic clustering of trees was based on the phylogenetic variations in the PA and NS gene segments where isolates showed district phylogenetic variations, harbored four (PA I to IV) and two (NS I and II), resulting in the classification of H5N6 HPAIVs into five genotypes (C1–C5). Of 343 IPs, the HPAI H5N6 virus isolated from 311 IPs was phylogenetically classified into four different clusters (hereafter genotypes), namely, C2, C3, C4, C5 (C1 only confirmed in wild bird species). Hence, we utilized these genotype classification numbers for individual IPs to categorize HPAI H5N6 outbreaks and distinguish transmission chains. Additionally, 7,954 non-IPs data was collected where the geographical coordinates, flock size, farm species, and the start date of preemptive depopulation were included, if applicable, which was collected as of July 28, 2016. Those data were obtained from the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (APQA), ROK. Non-IP was defined as commercial poultry farms having HPAI negative test results during national surveillance from November 16, 2016, to March 30, 2017.Between-farm vehicle movementWe obtained PPHaV movement data from the KAHIS, which includes a total 37,424 of visiting records to livestock productions associated with 284 HPAI H5N6 virus IPs of 343 IPs, excluding 59 premises where no visit log of preregistered vehicle movement was recorded as shown in Fig. 4. By law, PPHaVs are required to be installed with a GPS tracking device that transmits a signal to the KAHIS when it is located inside the boundary of a farm registered in the government database. All types of PPHaVs (n = 18) were listed in Supplementary Table S2 online. As of 2019, 59,521 vehicles were registered in the KAHIS (https://home.kahis.go.kr/home/sce/sce_m1_01.do). According to the regular inspection, it can be assumed that the great majority of vehicles are registered. Especially, the registration rate of veterinary service vehicles, feed and manure transporters are considered nearly 100% because the unregistered vehicles are not allowed to enter designated facilities.PPHaV movement data among poultry holdings were processed as follows. First, all movements originating from 284 IPs by PPHaVs were extracted from KAHIS during the study period from October 27, 2016, (20 days before the first IP report) to March 10, 2017 (one week after the last IP report). We determined study period and the maximum interval between infection and reporting was 21 days as specified in the OIE terrestrial code13 following reasons. First the incubation period of HPAI H5N6 infection in domestic poultry is estimated to be approximately four days16. Second the domestic duck infected with the HPAI H5N6 virus did not show apparent clinical signs and took a longer time to death while the infected chicken was showing apparently clinical signs17. Third, each poultry holding took a weekly mandatory test under nationwide active surveillance with the uncertainty of sensitivity (i.e., false negative) concerning different sample sizes, especially in the low prevalent phase18. Additionally, it was supposed that IPs were infectious from one day after the onset of infection and remained infectious until reporting or sampling date, because all both entries and exits from IPs come to be banned immediately after confirmed. Next, we probed inter-farm PPHaV movements from the extracted data that potentially associated with HPAI H5N6 virus transmission. It was presumed that a vehicle contaminated following a visit to an IP in the infectious state was infectious for other poultry holdings during a given period. The vehicle movements meeting this condition was defined as ‘potentially contaminating PPHaV movements’. Although HPAIV is known to be persistent, with the ability to survive for several weeks in the environment19,20, given the fact that vehicles are mandated to have disinfection before entering poultry holdings under HPAI control policy, the vehicles contaminated with HPAIV were presumed not to sustain infectivity for longer than three days.Figure 4Potentially contaminating vehicle movements originating from HPAI H5N6 infected premises (IPs) during 2016–17 epidemic across the country. There were 284 out of 343 IPs origin vehicle movements affecting 2,036 poultry holdings including 1,752 non-infected premises (dots colored with black). Those 284 IPs were classified into four groups based on HPAI H5N6 phylogenetic clusters except for 25 farms (dots colored with purple); 81 IPs belonged to cluster 2 (dots colored with red), 41 belonged to cluster 3 (dots colored with blue), 114 IPs belonged to cluster 4 (dots colored with yellow) and 23 IPs belonged to cluster 5 (dots colored with green).Full size imageNetwork analysis on all IPsGiven potentially contaminating vehicle movements under different assumptions about the length of interval between the infected and reporting days (7 days, 14 days, and 21 days) and the infectious duration for PPHaV movements (one day and three days), we built directed and weighted networks that were only composed of IPs with the genotype confirmed (259 of 284 IPs with visit logs, see Supplementary Fig S12 online ), excluding 25 IPs without phylogenetic cluster information as given in Fig. 4. In the network, each IP was considered a node, and a PPHaV movement between two IPs was regarded as an edge. The network was weighted by the frequency of PPHaV movements between two farms during the 2016–17 HPAI H5N6 epidemic. As a result, 98 IPs of 259 IPs had at least one tie formation with other IPs. First, with those interlinked networks, we examined the relationship between tie formation and the genotype of the HPAI H5N6 virus-infected IPs using a network metric named assortativity. Assortativity is a measure of how likely nodes with the same kind of attribute are to connect each other21,22. The assortativity coefficient is positive if similar nodes (i.e., same type of genetic group) tend to connect to each and negative if different genotype infected premises tend to interconnect (see methods in the Supplementary online)23. This metric was computed because if high assortativity is present in a network, it suggests homogenous mixing between the same genetic group of IPs, showing high consistency between tie formation via vehicle movement and HPAI transmission chains22.Second, to identify factors contributing to tie formation between the same genotype IPs, we performed logistic regression quadratic assignment permutation (LR-QAP) analysis in which the response variable was the presence (coded as one) or absence (coded as zero) of a tie between two IPs; explanatory variables included poultry integrators, type of farm species, and geographical distance. The type of distance we used was the Euclidean distance between interlinked infected premises via vehicle movement, measured as a continuous scale. We used LR-QAP analysis as a generic methodology for permutation tests in which nodes in the network were randomly re-allocated in the other nodal position of the network, and the test statistic of interest was then calculated and compared with the observed one24 because the variable between adjacent nodes was very unlikely to be independent of other network variables and because permutation tests have the advantage of missing data25. A p value was calculated as the count of permutations that generated statistics more extreme than the observed statistic25. As LR-QAP analysis uses dyadic covariates (pairwise variables between two nodes (i.e., IPs)), the explanatory variables were transformed into dyadic values to indicate the difference between the attributes of two nodes. For instance, if node A raised domestic ducks and node B also raised ducks, the value of the corresponding variable for the farm species was converted into zero. Thus, we performed LR-QAP analysis with dyadic covariates and compared the goodness of fit of the final model by comparing the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values of each network. The R packages 'sna' and ‘statnet' were used to perform LQ-QAP regression26,27.Bayesian modelling approachThe vehicle movements originating from IPs were hypothesized to be the main sources of infection for domestic poultry holdings. The null model for HPAI H5N6 transmission between the same genotype of IPs would be that the force of infections posed by other sources except for PPHaV movements originating from the same genotype IPs, which is assumed to be zero and results in no contribution of the spread of HPAI. To test this hypothesis, the force of infection was built with two parameters following the approach made in a previous study: \(P_{V}\) was the daily risk of infection by one potentially contaminating vehicle movement, and \(P_{B}\) was the daily risks of infection other than \(P_{V}\). The force of infection for farm i on day d (\(F_{i,d}\)) was fomulated as follows:$$ F_{i,d} = P_{V} n_{i,d}^{V} + P_{B} $$ where \(n_{i,d}^{V}\) represents the number of potentially contaminating vehicle movements farm i received on day d. Since dates of HPAI H5N6 infection were not exactly specified for IPs, we updated the infection dates (\(I_{i} )\), and therefore the time between infection and reporting (\(D_{i} )\), in each iteration by using a data augmentation approach based on the Metropolis-Hasting (MH) Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) algorithm, which has been applied to infer transmission dynamics from incomplete epidemic data28,29,30. With \(F_{i,d}\), \(I_{i}\), and \(D_{i}\), the likelihood of the epidemic data was expressed as follows:$$ L = \mathop \prod \limits_{i} {}e^{{{\mathop \sum \nolimits_{d = 1}^{I_{i} - 1}} - F_{i,d} }} \left( {1 - e^{{ - F_{{i,I_{i} }} }} } \right)f\left( {D_{i} ;\alpha ,\beta } \right)\mathop \prod \limits_{j} {}e^{{{\mathop \sum \nolimits_{d = 1}^{d_{{last_{j} }} }} - F_{j,d} }} $$The first term represents the probability that an IP i remained uninfected until a day before its infection date \(I_{i}\) and became infected on day \(I_{i}\) and the probability density function of the duration between infection and reporting in farms is expressed as a Gamma distribution, \(f\left( {D_{i} ;\alpha ,\beta } \right)\),, with \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) as mean and variance. The last term indicates the probability that a non-IP j did not become infected during the study period. The farms were culled during the study period and therefore no longer at risk of infection. Thus, for those farms, \(d_{{last_{j} }}\) indicates the date on which the farm was depopulated. We estimated the separate force of infection posed by potentially contaminating vehicle movements originating from four different genotype IPs (i.e., from C2 to C5), assuming that the farms with specific genotypes of the virus only had HPAI H5N6 virus transmitted by the same genotype IPs. Other genotype IPs were regarded as susceptible ones until the reporting date. Consequently, we obtained the joint posterior distribution of model parameters. Given the Gamma distribution by randomly sampling parameters αand βas mean and variance, which was the estimation of the posterior distribution of the interval between infection and reporting, we calculated the contribution of vehicle movements to HPA H5N6 infection in IPs. The more detailed information on the estimation for the contribution of vehicle movements to HPAI infection can be found in the Supplementary method section online.Three MCMC chains were used with a burn-in of 4,000 iterations and 20,000 iterations were used for each posterior distribution where convergence was inspected by MCMC trace plots and the Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic. To assess the best assumption of the infectious duration of potential contaminating vehicle movements (i.e., one day versus three days) explained the epidemic pattern better, we compared models based on their deviance information criterion (DIC) values. Moreover, because infection dates were not observed, we used a modified version of the DIC for models with missing data31.Permutation analysis on inter-linked same genotype of IPsTo explore contact properties relative to HPAI H5N6 transmission via IPs origin vehicle movements, we built a contact network composed of only the same genotype IPs based on the simulation results. We examined the following six contact properties: diameter, average path length, density, reciprocity, assortativity, and transitivity. The diameter of a network is defined as the shortest distance between the two most distant nodes in the network. The average path length is equal to the number of edges along the its shortest length between two nodes. Density is the proportion of edges that exist in a network. Reciprocity is the proportion of nodes in a directed network to be mutually linked. Transitivity refers to the ratio between the observed closed triplets and the maximum possible number of closed triplets in the graph. This index indicates how many tightly interconnected communities existed in a network32. The farm species and degree that represents the number of connections were used to measure the assortativity of the network as aforementioned. We calculated these metrics for directed and weighted networks using the R package "i-graph"33. Subsequently, we tested hypotheses about whether these metrics of observed contact networks between IPs were statistically different from those of simulated contact structure, which is a possible indicator of the epidemiological relevance of HPAI H5N6 transmission events34. Hypothesis testing was performed with a permutation approach where 1000 random networks were generated based on the density and the number of nodes. The test statistic, which included six contact properties, was calculated on the random network and compared with those of the observed network25,35,36. The median difference between observed value and simulated values with 5–95% percentile was calculated as the right skewed distribution. The C5-genotype IP interlinked network was excluded from the permutation test because of the low number of vertices and edges in a cluster. All maps in the figures present manuscript and supplementary file were generated based on the map obtained from the National Spatial Information Portal in the Republic of Korea that was publicly available (http://data.nsdi.go.kr/dataset/12942) using R software version 4.0.4.

At-home treatments can help manage the flu, but still connect with your doctor for additional help like antiviral medication. PeopleImages/Getty Images Flu can involve mild to severe symptoms like cough, aches and pains, fever, chills, and a runny nose. Drinking fluids, getting rest, and using OTC medications for pain and fever can offer some relief. Call your doctor if you’re at high risk of complications or symptoms don't improve in a few days.

Advertisement Each flu season, about 8% of the US population gets sick from influenza, a common viral infection that attacks the nose, throat, and lungs. The flu can cause mild to severe symptoms including cough, sore throat, body aches, fatigue, runny or stuffy nose, fever, and chills. You should start to feel better in five to seven days, but in the meantime here are seven of the most effective treatments and remedies for flu symptoms, according to doctors.Important: If you're in a high-risk group, track your flu symptoms closely and see a doctor if they worsen after a few days. "The flu can be dangerous, particularly for the elderly and people with compromised immune systems. In extreme cases, the flu can result in pneumonia and other severe medical issues," says Leann Poston, MD, the medical advisor for Impakt Fitness. Advertisement 1. Stay hydratedIf you've had the flu in the past, your doctor has probably recommended getting plenty of fluids — and with good reason: Your body needs more water when you're fighting off an illness. A fever can cause dehydration, says Poston, and being dehydrated will only worsen any fatigue you experience.Drinking more fluids can also thin out any mucus in your nasal passages and help ease congestion.For daily fluid intake, which includes the water you get from foods as well as beverages, The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recommends: 125 fluid ounces (3.7 liters) for men91 fluid ounces (2.7 liters) for womenWhen you're sick, you may want to increase this by 2 to 3 cups. Edo Paz, MD, VP of Medical at K Health, advises letting your thirst be your guide. Keep in mind that not all fluids are created equal. Poston recommends water, herbal tea, clear broth, warm lemon water with honey, and juice with no added sugar. When you're sick, it's generally best to avoid dehydrating beverages like alcohol, coffee, and caffeinated soda. Advertisement 2. Get some restGetting enough rest is the single most important thing you can do when getting over the flu, says Poston. Sleep supports your immune system, allowing your body to dedicate more energy and resources to fighting off the virus. Additionally, research suggests that not getting enough sleep can actually increase your odds of getting sick, so rest may also be a strategy for flu prevention.Make sure you're getting at least seven to nine hours of sleep per night, and if you're fatigued during the day, it's OK to take naps, says Paz.Quick tip: If you're congested, try sleeping with an extra pillow. Elevating your head can help clear nasal passages by encouraging mucus to drain, says Poston. Advertisement 3. Try over-the-counter medications to treat pain and feverOver-the-counter pain medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil) can be taken to ease certain flu symptoms, like fever, body aches, throat pain, and headache. Acetaminophen is typically what medical experts recommend because it can help reduce fevers. That said, it's not recommended for anyone with liver problems, as some of the medication is converted into a byproduct that's toxic to the liver and, if your liver isn't functioning normally, it can build up in the body. Important: Be careful when combining over-the-counter pain relievers with other flu medications, or any products designed for multi-symptom relief. Since these may also contain acetaminophen or an NSAID, you might end up taking too large of a dose — more than 4,000 mg/day for a healthy adult. Read labels carefully to make sure you aren't taking multiple products with the same ingredients. If you're ever unsure about the ingredients in a product, check with your doctor or pharmacist. Just know some research suggests that while fever-reducing drugs may make you temporarily feel better, they won't actually help you get better. Fevers are your body's natural response to infection, after all. "A low-grade fever can help your immune system fight the flu virus. It's best to ask your doctor when you should treat a fever," says Paz. Advertisement 4. Take a warm bathA warm bath can be immensely soothing for sore, achy muscles. "Try adding Epsom salt and baking soda to your bath to further reduce body aches, or you can add some drops of tea tree, juniper, rosemary, thyme, orange, lavender, or eucalyptus essential oils to help clear nasal passages," says Poston.Important: Avoid adding essential oils directly to a bath. Oil doesn't blend with water easily, so the oil can float on the water and irritate your skin. Always mix your oil of choice with a carrier oil first. You can add this blend to the running water so it mixes well. Since a warm bath can also help to induce drowsiness — helping you get the good night's sleep your body needs to fight off the flu — this could be a great addition to your bedtime routine, says Poston.

A salt water gargle is a natural home remedy that's safe, affordable, and convenient, not to mention especially effective for viral infections like the flu. Salt water gargles don't just provide immediate relief by easing pain and loosening mucus. The salt crystals also help dislodge viruses and bacteria. A small 2019 study of patients with a sore throat found that those who gargled with salt water experienced a significant decrease in self-reported pain after one week.Give it a try by dissolving 1/2 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water and gargle with this solution several times a day.You can also try sucking on mentholated cough drops or using herbal and over-the-counter throat sprays to ease the pain from a sore throat, says Poston.

Use a humidifierIf the air in your home is too dry, it can irritate your nasal passages and throat, but a portable humidifier can offer some relief."Humid air can help loosen congestion and soothe a sore throat and nose. It also creates an inhospitable environment for influenza, which prefers a dry climate," says Poston.Adding a few drops of eucalyptus or peppermint oil to the water in the humidifier may help with clearing sinuses, according to Poston. Remember to change the water daily to prevent the growth of bacteria. If you don't have a humidifier, try a hot shower instead — the steam can help moisturize your dry nasal passages and ease muscle aches.A 2010 study also suggests that portable humidifiers can help decrease the survival rate of the airborne influenza virus.

Not only can these saline nasal rinses help alleviate symptoms by moistening nasal passages, but they can also clear out clogged nasal passages so you can breathe more easily. "Rinsing the nasal passages with warm salt water can also encourage virus particles and bacteria to flow from your nose," says Poston.Give it a try: Mix 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda in 8 ounces of warm distilled, sterile, or boiled water. Tip your head to one side. Using a bulb syringe or neti pot, pour water into one nostril. Lightly hold your other nostril closed from the outside and let the water drain out. Repeat two to three times, then treat the other nostril.Important: With any nasal irrigation device, always use distilled, sterile, or water previously boiled for three to five minutes and then cooled for safety reasons. Tap water may contain low levels of bacteria and protozoa that can survive in nasal passages and cause serious infections.If you're immunocompromised, check with your doctor before using a sinus rinse device. Advertisement When to see a doctorFor some cases of flu, it's best to seek advice from a doctor or other healthcare professional. A few signs it's time to connect with your doctor: Symptoms that suggest a secondary bacterial infection such as ear pain, difficulty breathing, or fever or headache that won't go awayA sore throat that lasts longer than three to five daysWheezingA stiff neckSymptoms that get worse, not betterDifficulty drinking or keeping down fluidsDizzinessWeaknessChest painPeople older than 65, those who are immunocompromised, and those living with chronic diseases are at higher risk of complications from the flu, says Paz. If you are in a high-risk group and have flu symptoms, call your doctor as soon as possible.You should also call a doctor immediately if an infant under three months has a rectal temperature over 100.4 °F, or a child under the age of 2 has a persistent fever, says Paz. Advertisement Insider's takeawayAs a general rule, it's best to connect with your doctor if you think you have the flu. "If they test you within the first 24 hours or so, your doctor may start you on antiviral medications to shorten the course of your illness," Paz says.However, you can often manage the flu at home with a wide variety of treatments and remedies. Over-the-counter pain medications, warm baths, salt water gargles, and a humid environment can help alleviate symptoms as you're on the road to recovery.

It’s kind of the perfect storm of public health impacts here with Delta already impacting many areas of the country and jurisdictions,” Freeman said. “We don’t want to overwhelm systems more.” After circulating at nearly nonexistent levels last year, the flu is reappearing in certain areas across the United States, Dr. Manish Patel, team lead for the influenza prevention and control team at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a call hosted by the CDC’s Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) group last week. “We do know influenza is going to come back and already has started to reappear in many places in the United States,” Patel said. Now, health officials and doctors are preparing for more illness this winter. ‘It makes sense for us to be prepared’ The nation continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, and health officials worry about adding flu patients to this burden.

He added that flu activity is unpredictable. “Last year or last season – really, in the past 18 months – we have had no influenza activity in the United States and minimal activity globally in the Southern Hemisphere or the Northern Hemisphere. And this really has not happened before since we’ve had surveillance for influenza,” Patel said. “The jury is still out on reasons why that hasn’t happened.” In the first week of December, 841 people were admitted to US hospitals with influenza, according to the CDC. That’s up from the prior week, when there were 496 new flu admissions.

The majority of flu viruses were detected in young people, ages 5 to 24, but the proportion of flu virus detections among adults 25 and older has increased in recent weeks. In late November, the CDC said increased flu activity has been detected among young adults and college students, which could mean the start of a new flu season. The agency also noted that as the flu and the virus that causes Covid-19 both circulate, the combination could stress health care systems throughout the United States. Worry about a winter wave “We are already in a Delta surge,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday night. “The cases are going up. We have an average of about 117,000 cases. We have an increase in the percentage of hospitalizations. Deaths are still over a thousand,” Fauci said. “Then you have, looking over your shoulder, the Omicron variant, which we know, from what’s going on in South Africa and in the UK, is a highly transmissible virus. “That’s the reason why we are encouraging people, if they haven’t been vaccinated, to get vaccinated but, as importantly, for those who’ve been fully vaccinated to get a booster.” The United States is averaging 119,888 new Covid-19 cases each day, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, as of Wednesday. This is about 50% higher than a month ago. The United States is now also averaging 1,261 deaths each day, according to JHU. This is 5% higher than a month ago. There are 67,306 people now hospitalized with Covid-19, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. Hospitalizations have been trending up for more than two months, and this is 43% higher than a month ago. covid cases omicron spreads pkg gaither vpx_00000000.png video Related video Covid cases rise in the US as Omicron now in over half of all states This January, the United States could face a surge of Covid-19 cases, with the Omicron variant possibly contributing to the winter wave, according to modeling data that was presented to state and local health officials during a call with the CDC on Tuesday. But that’s just one possible scenario. The CDC told CNN in a written statement Tuesday that the agency “regularly discusses planning scenarios with public health officials around the country,” and Tuesday’s discussion “was part of a regularly scheduled meeting hosted by the CDC COVID-19 Response with the leaders of four public health organizations.” The statement noted that the CDC is “preparing for a range of scenarios” involving the Omicron variant, and a portion of Tuesday’s meeting was dedicated to “discussion around results from various modeling groups related to Omicron” – but no CDC, US Department of Health and Human Services or US government models were presented. 13/12/2021.

That's alarming even if it's mild The modeling information, along with data from Europe, indicates that the number of Covid-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant has the potential to double every two days, NACCHO’s Freeman told CNN. “When you think about how this virus has the potential to double every two days, then in a couple of weeks, we’re going to be facing a lot of cases of Omicron,” said Freeman, who was on part of Tuesday’s call. “That modeling implies that sometime in January, we will be at a different stage of recognizing Omicron, maybe as even a predominant virus. However, we still are learning about the severity, transmissibility,” Freeman said. “The data is emerging from around the world.” The proportion of Omicron cases in the United States is expected to “continue to grow in the coming weeks,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a virtual White House briefing Wednesday. She added that early data suggests Omicron is more transmissible than Delta, with a doubling time of about two days. While the Delta variant continues to cause the most Covid-19 cases in the United States, Omicron has gone from causing 0.4% of cases in the week ending December 4 to 2.9% of cases in the week ending December 11, according to CDC data. Currently, CDC data indicates that Delta causes 96.8% of cases. ‘We are definitely seeing an uptick in both infections’ Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatrician in Annapolis, Maryland, told CNN last week that there has been a “slow but steady” increase in patients testing positive for flu and Covid-19 in her pediatric network in recent weeks. Sick Young Man sleep in the Bed at the Home Sabphoto/Adobe Stock Photo Related article Yes, you can have Covid-19 and the flu at the same time. Here's what that could look like “We are definitely seeing an uptick in both infections over the last week,” said Johns, emergency medicine physician and senior medical adviser for PM Pediatrics, which has more than 70 pediatric office locations across the United States. “We are starting to see a slow and steady trickle of an increase of cases. And why is that? Well, because this is the time of year when we typically start to see influenza begin to circulate,” she said. “But why aren’t we seeing the explosive uptick? One reason is that school-aged children are still largely masked in many school districts, and so I think that that helps to keep numbers down. The overall layered protective measures that are still in place in many areas are effective for both Covid as well as influenza.” This winter, Johns said, there is the concern of a potential “twindemic” of Covid-19 and flu, and it’s important for people with any respiratory symptoms this season to see their doctor immediately for testing. She said when young people – up to age 26 – come into her office with symptoms, such as a cough, fever or runny nose, the only way to determine whether they have the flu, Covid-19 or a common cold is through testing.

There are some trends. Typically for influenza, the clinical hallmark is high fever, and that occurs less so in the common cold and is not always a feature of Covid-19 infection,” Johns said. “But none of that is 100%, and there’s enough overlap in all three of these that, really, the only way to know the difference is through testing.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

But the markets were left underwhelmed. Reuters reported​​ a sharp selloff in the biotech’s shares following the presentation of the results on December 10.mRNA-1010 encodes for the hemagglutinin (HA) protein from four seasonal flu viruses based on World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, including seasonal flu A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and influenza B/Yamagata- and B/Victoria-lineages. In the Phase 1 trial, mRNA-1010 was evaluated at 50 µg (0.05 mg), 100 µg and 200 µg dose levels in younger adults (age 18-49) and older adults (age 50+). The company said the data showed that the flu shot successfully boosted hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay geometric mean titers (GMTs) against all strains 29 days after vaccination at all doses tested in both younger and older adults, even at the lowest dose. And no significant safety concerns were observed, it added.In its review of the data, Moderna outlined how its ultimate goal is to develop an annual pan-respiratory single dose booster vaccine that can be tailored to circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2, seasonal influenza and RSV. “The positive interim results from our Phase 1 quadrivalent flu vaccine candidate, mRNA-1010, are an important milestone toward achieving that goal. It is encouraging to see that participants in the study who received the 50 µg dose, including older adults, achieved robust increases in geometric mean antibody titers against H1N1 and H3N2, the strains responsible for the vast majority of morbidity and mortality in this age group,”​ said Moderna CEO, Stéphane Bancel.However, Jefferies analyst, Michael Yee, in a client note, said the results of the Phase 1 study showed the mRNA based shot's efficacy was on par, generally, with standard flu vaccines from Sanofi. "On one hand, the antibodies increased to good levels, but on the other hand, the levels aren't necessarily seen as high or necessarily better than some high-(effectiveness) vaccines such as Flublok or Fluzone."​Phase 2 study​mRNA-1010 may show similar immunogenicity as current enhanced flu vaccines, but there is potential for even lower doses to show similarly strong immunogenicity and testing of an even lower dose will take place as part of a Phase 2 study, which is now fully enrolled, stressed Moderna.Interim analysis data from that trial is expected in early 2022 and could prove key as the study will include head-to-head evaluation of mRNA-1010 with a commercially licensed standard dose vaccine, said Bancel on a call on Friday with analysts. Preparation for a Phase 3 study of mRNA-1010 is also underway.“Our view on mRNA-1010, from the beginning, is that we want to aim at being as good as the best enhanced vaccines in the market, those that achieve premium pricing for older adults, like Fluzone HD does, with the highest market share in the US, and we want to use that as the starting point from what we then go build off of in our overall flu franchise.”​Three-pronged plan​The biotech’s strategy for seasonal flu vaccines is multifaceted, said the CEO.Alongside the development of mRNA-1010, he said the firm's strategy involves a second pillar - the expansion of coverage beyond quadrivalent flu vaccines, with it looking to advance two new candidates - mRNA-1011 and mRNA-1012 - that offer the opportunity to broaden strain coverage and enhance tools available to public health authorities when selecting antigens.A third pillar, which was previously announced, involves the widening of the immunologic breadth of its vaccines, including broader antigens – mRNA1020/1030 vaccines. “We will accomplish this by adding neuraminidase (NA) antigens, which have the potential to improve immunity by targeting more antigens that are more consistently conserved and subject to less antigenic drift over most years.”​The ultimate goal, though, is to pursue combinations: “We do believe that there is substantial value to be created by combining a very strong seasonal influenza vaccine platform, mRNA-1010, with COVID and eventually COVID plus RSV boosters,” ​said Bancel.Tackling strain mismatch, vaccine efficacy issues ​He anticipates such second and third generation product improvements will enhance vaccine efficacy and close some of the gaps from strain mismatch and other challenges in the flu market. Currently approved vaccines are around 40-60% effective and face significant challenges from strain mismatch and antigenic drift, remarked Bancel. And the CEO, zoning in on the H3N2 strain, during the call, reported how data from the past six years illustrates the co-circulation of multiple clades of H3N2 viruses each year, with the most common strain was different amongst many of the largest countries in the northern hemisphere.“One of the challenges of the current vaccine regime is that a single clade is picked. Often, however, in the H3 category, it represents less than 40% of all circulating H3N2 viruses, creating a high likelihood of mismatch with vaccines in at least some countries. This, we think, represents one of the most significant opportunities for improving vaccine efficacy.”​ ​ Copyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are © 2024 - William Reed Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions Related topics Markets & regulation Related news Show more Moderna to build mRNA manufacturing site in Kenya Moderna creates Enterprise Solutions Hub in Atlanta WHO establishes global biomanufacturing training hub in Korea Moderna to expand commercial network across six additional countries in Europe Show more Follow us Facebook Twitter Linkedin Webinars On-demand webinars Manufacturing Friendly Aggregate Clearance in Downstream Processing of Bispecific and Traditional Antibodies Using a Novel POROS Mixed-Mode Chromatography Media Thermo Fisher Scientific - Biosciences Headlines Aditum Bio and Leads Biolabs join forces in new company to fight autoimmune diseases Sarepta discontinues development of Duchenne ASO treatment vesleteplirsen Synaffix and BigHat Biosciences collaborate to develop AI-designed ADC EMA accepts Alvotech and Advanz Pharma’s Marketing Authorization Application for biosimilar of J&J’s Simponi AbbVie acquires Aliada Therapeutics in $1.4 billion deal Abzena announces major expansion of its biologics manufacturing facility Aldevron’s Anu Codaty on passion, leadership, and innovation AstraZeneca’s rare disease therapy Fasenra receives EU approval Follow us Facebook Twitter Linkedin BioPharma-Reporter Advertise with us Why Register?

Three-year-old Dylan Scully of Lakewood receives a kids’ influenza vaccination from Kaiser Permanente registered nurse Amy Roscoe, right, while visiting a Kaiser Permanente outdoor flu vaccination center in Ken Caryl with his brother Kellen, 6, and their mother, Jennifer Scully, left, on Friday, September 18, 2020. (Andy Colwell, Special to The Colorado Sun) Last year, Colorado’s flu season was virtually nonexistent. Only 34 people were hospitalized for the flu during the entire 8-month season in 2020 and 2021. There were zero reported flu deaths among kids. This year, the flu season is, well, existent. There have been at least 36 flu hospitalizations so far, a number that started the month at around half that sum then doubled in a single week. “It’s not a huge number but the fact that it doubled over the last week is concerning,” said Heather Roth, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s Immunization Branch chief. Flu vaccination rates are down compared to last year, as well. So Roth is remaining vigilant. It would not be unprecedented for a flu season that starts out calm to roar to life after the New Year. But there are also reasons for optimism. No kids have died from the flu so far this season. During the most recent pre-pandemic flu season, the 2019-20 season, nearly 200 people had already been hospitalized with the flu by this time — five times as many people as we’ve seen this year. Though vaccination rates are behind last year’s record highs, they are in line with previous years’ numbers. And Roth said vaccinations also appear to be picking up. As of last week, the state had administered about 1.6 million doses of flu vaccine. In the previous year, it had already administered 1.8 million doses by this time. But the number of flu vaccinations administered weekly has begun to outpace last year’s weekly trends. “It could be people are just waiting a little bit longer and all-told we’ll measure up pretty well to last year,” Roth said. Here’s more to know about the flu season this year: It’s definitely worse than last year This graph, produced by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, shows trends in flu-like illness seen at Kaiser Permanente facilities (top) and emergency rooms (bottom) across Colorado. The red line shows trends for the 2021-2022 flu season, while the purple line shows trends for 2020-2021 and the turquoise line shows baseline levels. (Provided by CDPHE) Last flu season, amid waves of stay-at-home orders and other social-distancing measures meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the U.S. saw one of the weakest flu seasons on record. Months went by with relatively few people showing up in hospitals or doctors’ offices with cases of the flu. This year is worse — but still not exactly bad. About 3% of people currently seeking treatment at Kaiser Permanente offices have influenza-like illness, well below the baseline of 5%. It’s worth noting that the flu season officially begins in October each year. In the graphs above, the small spikes occurring at the end of last flu season were happening in September of this year, a prelude to the higher flu activity of this season compared with last. There’s precedent for a flu season starting mellow and turning bad This graph, produced by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, shows flu-associated hospitalization trends in Colorado for the current season (shown in red) and previous six seasons. (Provided by CDPHE) The flu season typically peaks in January or February. But, in some years, it doesn’t peak until March. That’s why the calm start to this season could be a good sign — or it could be deceptive.

But focus for a minute on the light green line representing the 2015-16 season. It, too, started out slow. Then took off around the end of February. To Roth, this shows that, despite the good start this year, it’s not time for Colorado to get cocky. Getting vaccinated against the flu is still important, as is practicing good hand-washing and staying home when sick. “I think there’s definitely the potential for things to get bad,” she said. Among kids, the biggest worry right now is RSV This graph, produced by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, shows trends in pediatric hospitalizations related to flu (shown in blue), COVID-19 (in red) and RSV (in green). The rates for flu and COVID are for the entire state, while the rates for RSV are only for Adams, Arapahoe, Denver, Douglas and Jefferson counties. (Provided by CDPHE) Kids and older adults typically bear the brunt of the flu season. That’s true this year, too. Among the small number of hospitalizations so far, those 65 and older and those 5 and younger have the highest rates. But flu isn’t the most significant respiratory virus stalking children right now in Colorado — nor is it the second-most significant. Estimates of hospitalization rates for RSV — respiratory syncytial virus — were 82 times higher than those for flu in November. Pediatric hospitalization rates for COVID-19 were also significantly higher. COVID hospitalizations far exceed even the worst flu seasons This graph, produced by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, shows trends in hospitalizations related to flu (shown in the blue lines) and COVID-19 (shown in red). (Provided by CDPHE) There really is no comparison between the flu and COVID. Hospitalization rates for the coronavirus have far exceeded flu hospitalization rates for all recent years. In November, the hospitalization rate among all age groups for COVID was 188 times higher than the hospitalization rate for flu. But, Roth said, this is all the more reason to take the flu seriously. Even though the risk of hospitalization is lower, now is not a good time to take that gamble. Hospitals remain crowded places. Even though COVID hospitalizations have fallen in recent weeks, more than 1,300 people are currently hospitalized with the coronavirus in Colorado. The state’s hospital intensive-care units are 95% full and, according to federal data, nearly 38% of people in the ICU in Colorado are there with COVID. Getting vaccinated against both the flu and COVID will help reduce the strain on hospitals and also reduce the likelihood that you will end up in the hospital with either, Roth said. A flu vaccine can also limit the risk of passing the virus to someone who is vulnerable. The COVID and flu vaccines can be administered at the same time — just in different arms or, at least, 1 inch apart from one another in the same arm. About 56% of Coloradans 65 and older have gotten a flu vaccine this year, Roth said. But only about 18% of those ages 20 to 39 have. “I think sometimes people think they may have missed the window on flu vaccination because we start hammering them pretty hard in October,” Roth said. “There’s this belief that you need it before Halloween, and that’s not true. You really should be getting your vaccine as long as the virus is circulating.” Tagged: Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, coronavirus, COVID-19, flu, flu shot John IngoldHealth Reporter johningold@coloradosun.com John Ingold is a co-founder of The Colorado Sun and a reporter currently specializing in health care coverage.

The vaccine was found to be safe and effective at generating antibody responses, however, this early data suggests it may be no more effective than current flu vaccines.Following the extraordinary success of mRNA vaccines against the sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, research boomed in the field of mRNA therapeutics. Malaria, HIV and Lyme disease are just a few of the mRNA targets currently under investigation.But the flu is perhaps the biggest target for mRNA vaccine technology. Current flu vaccines, which are reformulated every year, are generally only at best 50 or 60 percent effective at preventing infection. Not only is it hoped mRNA vaccines can increase that efficacy, but new formulations can be developed in around 60 days, meaning annual flu vaccines could be better targeted at the specific strains circulating during a given season.While several mRNA flu vaccines are currently in development, Moderna is at the head of the pack and first to reveal interim data from its early-stage human trials. The data, announced via press release and not yet formally published, outlines the interim safety data and antibody responses from its first Phase 1 cohort.The vaccine was found to successfully induce antibody responses against all four strains of influenza targeted. Minimal dose response differences also suggest low doses of the vaccine should be as effective as higher doses. Moderna's side effect profile data for its Phase 1 mRNA flu vaccineModerna No serious adverse effects were detected in the study. However, a notable volume of Grade 2 and 3 systemic side effects were cited. These are similar to what has been seen with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and consist of symptoms including fatigue and headache.A Grade 3 side effect means the symptom was severe enough to interfere with one’s day-to-day life. Essentially these kind of side effects mean you are knocked out for a day or so after receiving a vaccine. These side effects were most prominent in younger cohorts but reassuringly were dose dependent. Nevertheless, the lowest vaccine dose did still result in 13 percent of those under 50 citing a Grade 3 side effect.The other problematic flag in the interim data is the efficacy of this vaccine inducing antibody responses compared to what is seen with the current market-leading flu vaccine Fluzone. The data indicates Moderna’s mRNA vaccine is not much better than Fluzone. A head-to-head immunogenicity comparison between the new mRNA flu vaccine and a currently available flu vaccineModerna In response to the somewhat disappointing data Moderna’s stock price plummeted by over 10 percent, indicating investors were spooked by the interim data, despite the company's attempt to put a rosy spin on the early results. The company responded by stressing this early data cannot be used as a correlate for efficacy, and Phase 2 trial data next year will offer clearer indications as to how well the vaccine performs in real-world conditions.As chemist Derek Lowe wrote in a piece for Science, this is a reminder that mRNA isn’t magic. While mRNA vaccines can be developed faster than conventional vaccines, helping produce seasonal vaccines more swiftly, they may not be preferable to what we already have if they are just as effective but with greater acute side effects.Stéphane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, says the overall goal for the company is to develop a single annual vaccine shot that can protect against an assortment of respiratory viruses. So instead of separate vaccines for influenza and COVID-19, the hope is mRNA technology can roll all these shots into one."At Moderna, our goal is to limit this suffering with an annual pan-respiratory single dose booster vaccine that is adapted to the circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2, seasonal influenza and RSV,” Bancel says.Source: Moderna View gallery - 3 images Tags Infectious DiseasesInfluenzaVaccinesVirusCoronavirus (COVID-19)New Atlas Audio Facebook Twitter Flipboard LinkedIn No comments Rich Haridy Rich has written for a number of online and print publications over the last decade while also acting as film critic for several radio broadcasters and podcasts.

Disease control measures including the humane culling of the affected birds have been put in place.Two positive cases were confirmed earlier this month in each of the counties, at Aughnacloy and Broughshane.

Why Trust Us?It’s that time of year again: flu season. Whether you’re already coming down with some winter sniffles or trying to avoid a cold at all costs, you’re probably thinking about scheduling your annual flu vaccine. You might be wondering about the side effects, and fever after flu shot is a big one. A fever is actually a common symptom of flu shots, says John Whyte, MD, a physician and the chief medical officer at WebMD. What counts as common, you ask? “In general, when it comes to drugs, a common side effect means more than half of people experience it,” Dr. Whyte explains. That said, he points out that many people do not feel any different post-vaccine. There are two main kinds of flu shots. The first is a live attenuated vaccine, which is a nasal spray with a weakened flu virus to the point it doesn't make you sick and is only offered to a limited number of people. The second one is an inactivated vaccine; it's made with a killed virus or a single protein from a virus, and this is the standard shot offered everywhere. The side effects for both are similar, Dr. Whyte notes, except that the attenuated vaccine may make your nose more runny or red but doesn’t cause arm soreness since there’s no needle. Overall, however, Dr. Whyte emphasizes that neither are capable of actually causing the flu and fever is possible with both. Here's everything you need to know about fevers and the flu shot, according to an expert MD and the CDC. Why do you get a fever after the flu shot?It's really important to note that a post-shot fever doesn’t mean you’ve actually gotten the flu, or that the shot is unsafe. The flu vaccine can decrease your likelihood of contracting the flu by 40 to 60 percent, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And even if you do get the flu, the vaccine can reduce the severity and long-term health risks of your illness, reports the CDC. A fever is actually a sign that your immune system has kicked in, Dr. Whyte says. (Your body is doing its job!) The vaccine introduces pieces of the virus into your body, and then your cells go to the site where the vaccine was given, causing an immune response, Dr. Whyte explains. All of this leads to inflammation in the body, which may manifest as a fever. Related StoriesCan You Get The Flu Shot When You're Sick?You’re Gonna Want To Get Your Flu Shot ASAP“Many experts believe one of the reasons why you might get a fever is because viruses don't like high temperatures, so raising your temperature is a way to fight the infection,” he adds. “It's one of the body's defenses.” And don’t worry, just because you don’t develop a strong bodily reaction from your shot doesn’t mean that you’re any less protected. TBH, it’s usually more common for kids (that include babies and toddlers) to have fevers than adults, Dr. Whyte says. Okay, but what temperature is considered normal?Both adults and children will likely develop a low-grade fever getting vaccinated, and your temperature should return to baseline after just one or two days, Dr. Whyte explains. While definitions vary slightly, a low-grade fever is typically less than 100.5 degrees. It's common to get a low-grade fever after a flu shot, which is typically less than 100.5 degrees. If a fever persists over the course of a few days and rises above 101 degrees, especially if you’ve already taken a fever reducer, you might be experiencing a high-grade fever. In this case, Dr. Whyte says you should probably head to your doctor's office for a checkup. Is it normal to get chills after the flu shot, too? While it’s not a given that you’d develop chills in addition to your fever, there’s always a possibility—chills are also common post-flu shot. “In general, chills occur right before a fever,” Dr. Whyte says, so look out for those symptoms shortly after you get the shot. And yep, chills are a part of the same immune response as when you get a fever: Upon injection, your body wants to increase its temperature to kill the virus. In order to do so, it sends a message to the brain that it needs to raise the temp, which then sends you into shivers or chills. These movements help create heat, carrying out your brain’s desire to raise your body temperature. What other side effects can you get from the flu shot? Other side effects of the flu shot include: HeadacheArm sorenessRedness at the injection siteFatigueNauseaMuscle achesYou may think these sound like the symptoms of the flu—but again, they’re not. These are all symptoms of receiving the vaccine, per the CDC. Related StoriesShould Pregnant People Get The Flu Shot?10 Flu Shot Side Effects You Should Know About Both inactivated and attenuated shots cause the same set of side effects (with minimal variation) year after year, Dr. Whyte says. Symptoms will generally occur within a few hours after your vaccination, and at the very latest one to two days post-vaccine, Dr. Whyte explains. “It would be very unusual to have symptoms after one to two days, but there are some instances where reactions could occur two weeks later,” Dr. Whyte says. If you have any of these symptoms multiple weeks after getting jabbed, you may want to consult your doctor. When do you need to see a doctor? A fever alone isn’t a concerning symptom and, as mentioned, it might even be accompanied by chills or headaches. If your fever happens to reach above 101 degrees and lasts for more than two days, it’s best to call your doctor, Dr. Whyte says. This is especially true for children and immunocompromised individuals.Most people will not need medications to ease the side effects—but if you'd like to try remedying your fever with OTC treatments, Dr. Whyte recommends Tylenol or Motrin. You may have heard that certain meds can lower the effectiveness of the vaccine, but there's not a ton of research to support those claims. “Taking one or two pills likely isn’t going to make much of a difference,” Dr. Whyte says. Overall, it’s very unlikely that you would experience any concerning symptoms after receiving a flu vaccine. Most side effects are super mild, and many people have none at all, Dr. Whyte notes. (Except, say, slight tenderness at the injection site.)The bottom line: A low-grade fever post-flu shot is totally normal and usually NBD. You won't need to see a doctor unless your temp goes above 101 degrees and stays high for more than two days.

[iStockphoto] The Kenya Medical and Research Institute (KEMRI) has declined reports of an influenza outbreak in the country. This follows media reports that there is an outbreak resulting from the current surge in the number of flu cases recorded in several health facilities. In a press statement, the research institute stated that it has not reported any ‘influenza outbreak" in the country in what it terms as media allegations based on the untruth. "Indeed, this information attributed to our research is not only incorrect but also taken out of context and has only succeeded in causing undue panic to members of the public,'' read the statement in part. The state corporation added, “The alleged media reports indicated that the ‘outbreak’ is based on a total of the 36 samples tested over a three-month period from September to November 2021 during our usual surveillance exercise in the country”. Kemri's statement indicated that out of this total of 36 samples, only four (4) tested positive for flu which is an insignificant finding to warrant concerns of an influenza outbreak. "On average, the four positive tests within a three-month period may equate to nearly one positive case per month which does not reach the threshold of an influenza outbreak". The statement read. Past outbreaks, Kemri, said have involved a higher percentage of cases being positive. In one incident, 150 samples testing positive from a sample of 250; and in another case 14 out of 20 samples tested positive. “We know from our long-term studies in Kenya that influenza viruses circulate all year, so you can expect a certain number of people to have the flu at any given time which is not considered an outbreak," the statement read. It adds: Indeed, previous studies have shown that Kenya records two peaks following rainy seasons. In our opinion, the information above is not sufficient to declare this as an outbreak. KEMRI clarified that a single case of an Ebola virus or poliovirus infection is always considered an outbreak due to the severity of these infections or the virus's eradication status. But this is not the case for influenza virus infections, especially in the tropics. The institution’s communication officials have also urged members of the public not to panic about the reported ‘outbreak’ of influenza but should instead exercise higher standards of personal hygiene - including hand washing, not crowding, eating healthy, and visiting their local health provider as preventive measures.

Picture: SOPHIE RALULU More than 200 people had been affected with a type of influenza on Taveuni that triggered a health alert for the island population on December 1989. This newspaper published an article on December 28 of that year highlighting influenza. Waiyevo Hospital had been treating patients for a week and several serious cases had been admitted. The sub-divisional medical officer on the island then, Dr Apenisa Waqa Naceba, told The Fiji Times it was worrying that the sickness was prevalent among children below five. “We had fears it was related to dengue because the symptoms were like dengue, but it has been established it is not so even though we have had a number of dengue cases,” he said. Dr Naceba warned that if the disease was not treated early, it could develop into pneumonia. “There are a few cases which had reached that stage which we had to admit. Other cases which we suspected serious were also admitted.” Symptoms of influenza are headache, cold, body pains especially in the joints and muscle and coughs. The sickness was contagious and easily transmitted in crowded places like schools. Dr Naceba said humidity and the sudden weather changes could have caused the outbreak. The previous week, the hospital recorded 60 cases of influenza. “We are concerned it has increased to over 200. It is spreading fast.” He said in minor cases, aspirins and panadol were given to patients. “But in serious cases we have to give concentrated antibiotics and penicillin injections.” Dr Naceba said it was fortunate infected infants were isolated cases. “In infant cases it was mainly common cold, but mothers should take extra precaution to safeguard their babies from contracting the sickness. “The ailment cannot be eradicated. It is here to stay, but it must be controlled and this can only be achieved through clean living.” Meanwhile Dr Naceba said an anti-dengue campaign was being concentrated on Somosomo and Naqara settlements where there were large numbers of infected people. Health inspectors then carried out another round of spraying as soon as chemicals arrived from Suva.

[iStockphoto] The Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) has confirmed an outbreak of Influenza in the country. In an alert, Kemri said four out of 36 samples tested positive for Influenza A. Influenza (Flu) is a common viral infection that can be deadly, especially to high-risk groups. Medics say it attacks the lungs, nose, and throat. Severe infections of Influenza A can be fatal. Kemri has further advised Kenyans to observe the Covid-19 protocols as stipulated by the Health Ministry and urged for heightened vaccination. Asked about the severity of the flu, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe on Wednesday said there was no cause for alarm yet. “There are things we observe before we go into panic mode for instance the severity of the flu, hospitalization, and fatalities. So far the statistics we have do not point to a situation that should cause panic,” Kagwe assured. Over the last few days, several people have taken to social media to complain of acquiring flu-like symptoms. This comes amid rising cases of Covid-19 and three confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in the country. Yesterday, Kenya reported 799 new infections out of 7,529 samples tested in a day, with a 10.6 per cent positivity rate.

(Suree Pritchard/AAP IMAGES) NZ ‘inhalation chambers’ story from 1918 flu epidemic is on the wrong track AAP FactCheck December 15, 2021 WHAT WAS CLAIMED New Zealanders needed proof of zinc sulphate inhalation treatment to use trains during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. OUR VERDICT Mostly false. While experts say there was no widespread mandate, newspaper articles from the time reported on at least two local rulings. As New Zealanders began a summer of “freedoms” that required proof of vaccination, some drew a link to claimed restrictions put in place during the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic. Facebook and Twitter posts claim Kiwis could only travel by train once they proved they had been treated in inhalation chambers using zinc suphate. However, the posts are mostly false. Zinc sulphate inhalation chambers did exist and were used during the pandemic in NZ and Australia in an attempt to prevent infection – but there was no widespread mandate required for train travel, experts told AAP FactCheck. The social media posts share the same core information and include a historical image of women using a communal inhalation chamber. A Facebook post from a New Zealand account begins: “Sound familiar???? In 1918 New Zealand set up inhalation chambers filled with zinc sulfate. … In order to travel by train, people had to present papers proving that they had been treated.” It adds that the “public were lied to and encouraged to attend these chambers”, where they inhaled zinc sulphate mist to protect against infection. In reality, the post claims, the mist caused damage to the lungs and throat. Other posts make a pared-back version of the claim, such as this tweet with the tagline “Dr Tenpenny”, referring to prominent US anti-vaccine activist Sherri Tenpenny. Her false claims about COVID-19 vaccines have been covered by various media outlets and fact-checkers (see here, here, here, here and here). Dr Tenpenny’s Twitter account was suspended as of the time of writing, but in early November she tweeted about the NZ inhalation chambers using the same image and text as subsequent tweets from other users. Historians contacted by AAP FactCheck said the claim that New Zealanders needed to show they were treated at inhalation chambers before they could travel by train during the 1918 flu epidemic was not correct and was made without supporting evidence. Professor Linda Bryder, a historian at the University of Auckland, described the claim as “rubbish” and “absolutely untrue”. “The Health Department set up inhalation chambers with solutions of zinc sulphate but there was no way they were compulsory or a requirement for travel! Such misuse of history is appalling,” Prof Bryder said in an email. There is no evidence of widespread mandates in news reports from the time. However, an article from the Ashburton Guardian from November 1918 makes reference to a local ruling. It states train users must “obtain a certificate from the (health) Inspector that they have been through the chamber.” A December 1918 article in the New Zealand Herald also references the recent opening of an inhalation chamber at Rotorua railway station which all incoming passengers were required to pass through. University of Canterbury emeritus professor Geoffrey Rice said these were isolated rulings and that Europeans (Pakeha) were otherwise unrestricted in their train travel. “It was different for Maori, as the authorities were anxious to prevent them from travelling to attend tangi (funerals),” he said via email. “The aim was to prevent crowds and the spread of infection.” An article on the government’s NZ History website notes Christchurch health officials introduced rules that meant Maori could only travel with a permit, however Prof Rice said to his knowledge this was not contingent on producing an inhalation certificate. Several news outlets also carried a Press Association report about the passengers of one Sydney-bound steamship being advised they had to pass through an inhalation chamber at Wellington in order to avoid quarantine on arrival. He also said the claim the public were lied to by the government was not true. “From my own research on the 1918 flu in NZ, I can say categorically that the government of the day never knowingly lied to the public but did ask newspaper editors not to publish death totals so as not to panic the public. That had the opposite effect from that intended, as the absence of official figures let rumours run wild.” A Museum of New Zealand entry notes the zinc sulphate sprays were believed to be antiseptic but it says they were ineffective against influenza and may have done damage to recipients’ throat and lung tissues. Breathing in zinc sulphate can irritate the respiratory tract, according to the US-based National Pesticide Information Center. The photo in Dr Tenpenny’s tweet and the other posts is not of a NZ inhalation chamber. It was published in The Australasian newspaper on February 15, 1919 and shows an “inhalatorium” at the Kodak Company in Melbourne. The caption says Kodak used the inhalation system in an attempt to protect employees against the epidemic. The Verdict The claim that New Zealanders needed proof of zinc sulphate inhalation treatment to use trains during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic is mostly false. While newspaper reports from the time note at least two local rulings, experts say there was no widespread mandate. Instead, they said the inhalation chambers were voluntary and there was no mandate for train travel. Mostly False – The claim is mostly inaccurate but includes minor elements of truth. * AAP FactCheck is an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network.
