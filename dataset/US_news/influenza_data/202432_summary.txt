Flu Burden Estimates: The CDC provides weekly, preliminary estimates of the cumulative in-season numbers of flu illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States. These estimates are based on surveillance data collected through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), covering approximately 9% of the U.S. population. The estimates are calculated using a mathematical model and are updated weekly throughout the season. The estimates for the 2023-2024 flu season indicate that there have been between 34-75 million flu illnesses, 15-33 million flu medical visits, 380,000-900,000 flu hospitalizations, and 17,000-100,000 flu deaths. These estimates provide a range to better reflect the full burden of flu in the United States as not all cases are captured by surveillance.
