Due to mutations in circulating strains, formulating effective vaccines remains a challenge. The use of computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) hemagglutinin (HA) proteins is a promising vaccine strategy to protect against a wide range of current and future influenza viruses. Though effective in preclinical studies, the mechanistic basis driving the broad reactivity of COBRA proteins remains to be elucidated. Here, we report the crystal structure of the COBRA HA termed P1 and identify antigenic and glycosylation properties that contribute to its immunogenicity. We further report the cryo-EM structure of the P1-elicited broadly neutralizing antibody 1F8 bound to COBRA P1, revealing 1F8 to recognize an atypical receptor binding site epitope via an unexpected mode of binding.

Despite advances in vaccine technology, formulating broadly effective influenza vaccines remains a challenge. Due to the multiplicity of endemic influenza strains as well as virus evolution through point mutations (“antigenic drift”), annual vaccine efficacy ranges from 10 to 60%1. In addition to the annual burden posed by seasonal infections, influenza also possesses high pandemic potential with four historic pandemics in 1918, 1957–1958, 1968, and 20092. These factors have led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to prioritize the research and development of more effective vaccines3.One approach to attain more broadly protective vaccines is the use of computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens (COBRAs). The COBRA approach utilizes known sequence information to generate composite proteins representing a broad swath of viruses. Input sequences from a desired antigen target are subjected to an iterative series of sequence alignments to generate primary, secondary, and tertiary (or more) consensus sequences that converge to a final optimized antigen representing both conserved and divergent features within the design space4. Using this method, COBRA hemagglutinin (HA) proteins have been generated that are more broadly protective than wildtype proteins when used as vaccine immunogens in preclinical models4,5,6,7. In some cases, these COBRA HAs are protective not only against viruses that postdate the time-range of the input design sequences, but also emerging strains8, suggesting that antigens designed by this method elicit immune responses that are resilient to antigenic drift9.Among the effective HA candidates designed for H1 influenza viruses is the COBRA HA termed P1 (Fig. 1). P1 was constructed using a combination of human H1N1 sequences spanning the years 1933–1957 and 2009–2011, along with swine sequences from 1931 to 199810. P1 elicits protective immunity in mice to a broad range of H1N1 viruses, including historic strains, swine strains, pandemic strains such as A/California/04/2009 (CA/04/09) and A/California/07/2009 (CA/07/09), and recently emerged strains like A/Brisbane/02/2018, A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019, and G47,8,10,11,12. Specifically, P1 vaccination in mice results in the production of a broadly neutralizing antibody response, including the broadly reactive, head targeting monoclonal antibody 1F88,11. Overall, these characteristics of P1 and similar antigens highlight the great potential of COBRAs to address current needs in vaccine development.Fig. 1: Sequence alignment of HA proteins.The ectodomain of mature HA proteins for COBRA P1, A/California/04/09 (CA/04/09; Accession number ACP41105.1), A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (SI/3/06; Accession number ABU99109.1), A/Denver/1/1957 (DV/1/57; Accession number ABD15258.1), A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR/8/34; Accession number ADX99484.1) and A/Swine/Iowa/15/1930 (Sw/IA/15/30; Accession number Q9WCD9.1) were aligned with CLUSTAL OMEGA77 and manually checked.

Numbered green circles denote cysteines paired together in disulfide binds.Full size imageAlthough P1 elicits broad protection in mice against diverse H1 influenza viruses, the mechanistic details undergirding its breadth remain to be fully elucidated. While comparative immunological studies have inferred some antigenic features that play a role in eliciting a broadly reactive antibody response, the exact structural details are unknown13. In addition, the epitope(s) targeted by P1-produced broadly neutralizing antibodies, such as 1F8, have not been identified. To elucidate these details, we determined the structures of the COBRA P1 alone and in complex with 1F8. The 3.0 Å crystal structure of COBRA P1 reveals antigenic features and an atypical glycosylation site that influence the immunogenicity of the HA head domain. Using cryo-EM, we solved a 3.1 Å structure of 1F8 bound to P1, revealing 1F8 to be a receptor binding site (RBS) targeting antibody with a unique mode of binding relative to published antibodies. These data provide fresh insights into how COBRAs elicit broadly protective immunity that can inform future rational vaccine design.ResultsCOBRA P1 HA forms a structurally intact prefusion trimerInitial attempts to solve a structure with mammalian expressed COBRA P1 HA containing a Foldon trimerization domain and affinity tags failed to yield diffracting crystals. To obtain a more optimal sample, the P1 gene was cloned into a vector for baculovirus-mediated expression and secretion in insect cells to generate a protein product with simpler glycosylation. In addition, a thrombin cleavage site was added to enable the removal of the flexible Foldon domain and affinity tags from the HA protein. Following affinity purification and digestion to release the tags, the majority of P1 protein product remained trimeric based on size exclusion chromatography, suggesting it retains structural integrity even in the absence of the stabilizing trimerization domain (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 2: Purification and structural determination of COBRA P1.a Size exclusion trace of COBRA P1 following thrombin digestion to release the T4 fibritin Foldon trimerization domain and affinity tags.

The major head antigenic sites are shown in yellow, orange, magenta, purple, and sky blue for Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2, and Cb, respectively. Residues comprising the Central Stem and Anchor epitopes are shown in royal blue and bright green. Carbon and oxygen atoms in glycans are colored as gray and red spheres.Full size imageThe trimeric P1 protein produced high quality crystals that resulted in a 3.0 Å-resolution structure (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 2, Table 1). The overall structure adopts a classical HA fold in the prefusion HA0 conformation, with tightly packed α-helices forming the stem and β-sheet rich regions comprising the head domain. Comparison with native HA sequences shows that the classical antigenic sites are surface-displayed and glycosylation modifications are present at the predicted motifs (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2b, c). Overall, the COBRA P1 HA exhibits native-like structural characteristics, confirming the structural integrity of these computationally designed proteins.Table 1 Data collection and refinement statistics (molecular replacement).Full size tableThe structural features of immunodominant antigenic sites reflect immune protectionP1 elicits protective antibodies against historic influenza strains as well as pandemic strains, such as CA/04/09. It fails to protect, however, against some pre-pandemic seasonal strains such as A/Brisbane/59/2007 (Br/59/07) and Solomon Islands/3/2006 viruses (SI/3/06)7,10. Comparison of P1 to the CA/04/09 and SI/3/06 HA structures reveals these immunological patterns correlate with the similarity of the major head antigenic sites with those in P1 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3)14,15.Fig. 3: Structural features of HA head antigenic sites.Crystal structures of HA from CA/04/09 and SI/3/06 (PDB entries 3LZG and 6CF7) were aligned to COBRA P1. The residues forming the major head antigenic sites Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2, and Cb are shown as sticks. Residue names and numbering are shown for COBRA P1, with those that differ in CA/04/09 and SI/3/06 indicated by red asterisks with differing amino acid labels.Full size imageIn the Sa site, CA/04/09 is almost identical to P1 with only a single residue change. In contrast, SI/03/06 contains four amino acid differences. Although the change in CA/04/09 from a glycine to an asparagine at residue 156 could impact the flexibility of the loop, the fundamental surface features of the site change very little. In SI/03/06, however, the changes include the loss of charged amino acids at positions 153 and 160 and the addition of a leucine at 157 that presents a more neutral and hydrophobic interface that may disrupt antibody binding. In a similar manner, the Sb site in CA/04/09 shows relatively small changes, with alanine residues substituted for threonine and glutamate at positions 186 and 195. While this involves the loss of polar and charged amino acids, respectively, it represents merely the loss of potential interacting sidechains without introducing additional disruptive effects in the binding interface. SI/3/06, on the other hand, possesses an isoleucine, arginine, and lysine in place of serine, glutamine, and asparagine at residues 185, 189, and 194, respectively, among the seven amino acid differences. These residues not only alter the electrostatic surface, but also present bulky side chains that would be expected to disrupt binding from antibodies targeting this site in P1.In contrast to Sa and Sb, the Ca1, Ca2, and Cb sites all show a high degree of variability in both CA/04/09 and SI/3/06. Upon closer examination, however, there are subtle differences that may favor CA/04/09. In the Ca1 site, the biggest difference in CA/04/09 is an arginine rather than an asparagine residue at position 205, with isoleucine versus valine and aspartate versus asparagine resulting in residues with similar properties at positions 166 and 168. On the other hand, SI/03/06 contains a glutamate instead of a glycine at residue 170, resulting in a big change in shape and charge within the surface-exposed region of the antigenic site. In Ca2, both P1 and CA/04/09 prominently feature a lysine residue at positions 141 and 142, respectively, albeit in a flipped residue order. SI/03/06 instead contains a glutamate at residue 141, essentially switching the surface charge at this antigenic site. Finally, while both CA/04/09 and SI/3/06 HAs exhibit three amino acid differences in Cb, the changes in CA/04/09 are for small, polar amino acids whereas SI/3/06 includes the addition of an additional charged residue at position 73.Examination of the highly conserved HA Central Stem and Anchor epitopes reveals similar sequences between P1 and historic and pandemic strains (Fig. 1)16,17,18. However, whereas P1 and SI/03/06 are nearly identical in the Stem epitope, some differences in CA/04/09, such as Asp373 and Glu374, may affect P1-elicited antibodies from targeting this site. On the other hand, Anchor epitope residues are identical between P1, CA/04/09 and SI/03/06, suggesting P1 should be able to elicit broadly reactive antibodies targeting this conserved site.Glycosylation at COBRA P1 HA residue 127 impacts access to an antigenic siteWhile analyzing the structure, we observed an unusual glycosylation site, Asn127, present in a hypervariable region of the HA protein (Fig. 1). Although not located within the classical antigenic sites, it is in close spatial proximity with Sa. Comparing the P1 structure to that of DV/1/57 HA bound to the RBS-targeting antibody C05 suggested that this glycosylation might present a steric hindrance to antibody binding (Fig. 4a). We hypothesized that glycosylation at this site in P1 could mask binding by some head-targeting antibodies. To test this, we generated a mutant P1 construct that deleted this glycosylation site by exchanging asparagine for aspartate, as is present in CA/04/09 (Figs. 1 and 4a). We then compared this mutant P1 (P1 N127D) with the unmodified construct (P1 wt) by measuring binding with a set of head-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) elicited by CA/04/0911,19 (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 4). Most of the mAbs exhibited similar binding properties for both the mutant and unmodified proteins, with the notable exception of CA09-15 which had a substantially higher affinity for P1 N127D compared to P1 wt. To gain a more precise measure of the difference in binding, we repeated the experiments with CA09-15 with expanded dilution series to quantify the affinity of binding (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). This revealed that CA09-15 mAb binds to P1 N127D with a 20 to 30-fold tighter affinity compared to P1 wt. Further characterization using the isolated fragment antigen-binding (Fab) region of CA09-15 showed even bigger differences (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 5). Whereas the monovalent Fab bound strongly to P1 N127D, no measurable binding occurring with P1 wt, suggesting that interactions with the wildtype antigen are primarily maintained through avidity. This suggests that the Asn127 glycosylation site may have a functionally impactful role on the repertoire of antibodies elicited by P1.Fig. 4: Impact of Asn127 glycosylation on antibody binding with COBRA P1.a Closeup of Asn127 of COBRA P1 overlayed with structures of CA/04/09 (PDB 3LZG) and DV/1/57 bound to the RBS-targeting antibody C05 (PDB 6ML8). b Biolayer interferometry of wildtype and N127D mutant COBRA P1 with antibodies known to target the head domain of CA/04/09 HA. c Kinetics of mAb CA09-15 binding with wildtype and mutant COBRA P1 measured by biolayer interferometry.

Specifically, mAb 1F8 displays broad hemagglutination inhibition activity against both historical seasonal and pandemic H1N1 influenza strains11. To elucidate the mechanism of broad reactivity, we performed cryo-EM studies of Fab 1F8 bound to P1 (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 7, Table 2). The complex formed particles with diverse orientations as shown in the 2D classes, resulting in a 3D reconstruction with an average resolution of 3.1 Å (Supplementary Fig. 7). The refined volume consisted of two Fabs bound to a single trimer with well-resolved features between the antibody Fv regions and the HA head domain (Fig. 5a). This revealed 1F8, a high affinity antibody (see below), to bind a conformational epitope with a buried surface area of ~700 Å2. Examination of the regions of contact demonstrates that the epitope is comprised of the receptor binding site (RBS) and part of the Ca2 antigenic site (Fig. 5b). Notably, the light chain is the sole contributor to binding the RBS, while the heavy chain forms most of the interactions with the Ca2 antigenic site.Fig. 5: Cryo-EM structure of COBRA P1 bound to antibody 1F8.a 3D volume of the COBRA P1-1F8 complex, colored based on protein identity. b Gaussian filtered map (ChimeraX) clarifying the stem domain and constant regions of the Fab. c Closeup views of the epitope recognized by 1F8 (top) and overview of the antibody binding footprint (bottom). Regions of the footprint in HA that contact the light chain, heavy chain, or both are colored salmon, purple, or magenta, respectively.Full size imageTable 2 Cryo-EM data collection, refinement and validation statistics.Full size tableLooking more closely at the interface reveals the molecular details of the interactions that drive antibody binding (Fig. 6a). The complementary determining region loop 1 of the light chain (CDRL1) inserts into the RBS, with the major points of interaction occurring in Phe30a and Asp30b. This phenylalanine packs with Trp150, while other residues, including Lys130 and Leu191, form the edges of a hydrophobic pocket that facilitates this interaction. The aspartate forms an electrostatic interaction with Tyr91, with His180 and Gln223 in close enough proximity to potentially contribute additional transient interactions. At the Ca2 antigenic site, the CDR loops of the heavy chain and CDRL3 of the light chain frame a hydrophobic boundary around residues 138–142 of HA. Within this boundary, Glu50 in CDRH2 forms a salt bridge with Lys141 to seal the interaction. Interestingly, the sequence differences for both CA/04/09 and SI/3/06 HAs would remove this feature. In the case of CA/04/09, the lysine is shifted to the position of P1 residue Ser142. While there appears to be sufficient space to accommodate the larger side chain, the additional distance removes the potential to form the salt bridge. In SI/3/06, the substitution of the lysine for a glutamate introduces a direct charge repulsion between these residues that would be detrimental for binding. These structural features account for the previous observation that 1F8 has substantial, but lesser activity for CA/04/09 compared to P1, and much lower activity for SI/3/0611.Fig. 6: Molecular interactions between COBRA P1 and Fab 1F8.a Closeup views of the interface between COBRA P1 and 1F8 in the RBS, Ca2 antigenic site, and region near the Asn127 glycan. Electrostatic interactions are shown as orange dashes. b Biolayer interferometry kinetic assays of Fab 1F8 binding with wildtype and mutant COBRA P1. Representative runs of each are shown. The KD, rate of association (ka), and rate of dissociation (kd) values are reported as the mean of two independent experiments.Full size imageWhile examining the structure, we noticed that the glycosylation modification at Asn127 in P1 was in close proximity with Glu93 and Gln27 of the 1F8 light chain. To assess whether the glycosylation was contributing to antibody interaction, we measured the binding affinity of Fab 1F8 with both the P1 wt and N127D proteins (Fig. 6b). Both proteins bound 1F8 to a similar degree, with mean KD values of 2.95 nM and 0.86 nM for the wildtype and mutant constructs, respectively. The small improvement in binding observed for the mutant can be attributed to a marginally faster association rate, suggesting that while glycosylation at residue 127 does not play a direct role in 1F8 binding, its absence results in a more readily accessible epitope.1F8 is a unique RBS-targeting antibodyAntibodies that target the RBS have been a priority for the discovery and development of broadly reactive therapeutics20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31. To better understand the properties of 1F8, we compared our model to the known structures of other RBS antibodies bound to HA (Fig. 7). Looking at the general orientation of binding immediately reveals a stark contrast in how 1F8 engages HA compared to previously characterized antibodies (Fig. 7a). While most RBS antibodies approach from a steep, vertical angle of approach, 1F8 comes in almost perpendicular to the HA. Despite this difference, however, a closer examination of the interface reveals shared principles of binding in the RBS (Fig. 7b). In each case, the central feature is a hydrophobic residue packing with tryptophan in the RBS, supplemented with additional interactions. The antibodies 1F8, 1F1, CH65, and F045-092 contain a dipeptide motif, consisting of a hydrophobic residue followed by an aspartate, that is a common but non-universal feature of RBS antibodies24,27,28,29. In 1F8 and 1F1, the aspartate interacts with a universally conserved tyrosine, while in CH65 and F045-092 it forms electrostatic contacts with polar and/or charged residues along the edge of the RBS. While C05 lacks the dipeptide feature, it similarly forms polar interactions by means of a serine that interacts with a glutamate in HA. S139, though lacking any clear electrostatic contacts, has a strongly hydrophobic surface to drive packing with tryptophan.Fig. 7: Comparison of 1F8 with other known RBS antibodies.a Overall view of the COBRA P1-1F8 mode of binding compared to antibodies 1F1 (PDB 4GXU), CH65 (PDB 5UGY), C05 (6ML8), F045-092 (PDB 4O58), and S139 (PDB 4GMS). Each structure is depicted as a single monomer bound to Fab, with line segments added to illustrate the relative orientations of the antibodies upon binding. b Closeup views of the RBS interactions for each antibody, with key contacts indicated by black dashed lines. c Complementarity Determining Regions of each antibody assigned according to the Chothia numbering system (annotated using the AbRSA server80). Residues forming important contacts within the RBS are boxed in red.Full size imageDespite sharing common molecular features with other RBS antibodies, however, the way in which 1F8 accomplishes these interactions is vastly different. Most of the antibodies reach into the RBS by means of the heavy chain loops CDRH2 or CDRH3 (Fig. 7c). In contrast, the interaction in 1F8 is mediated by residues in the light chain loop CDRL1. The use of the light chain in part accounts for the different angle of binding and sets it apart from other RBS antibodies that have been structurally characterized to date.DiscussionFormulating influenza vaccines has long been a challenge due to the need to keep pace with an ever-changing landscape of circulating viruses. As new tools have emerged in vaccine technology, the prospects for developing more effective and durable vaccines have improved substantially, including the potential for “universal” vaccines to combat influenza. Structural characterization of candidate antigens plays a critical role for elucidating mechanisms of action and performing rational vaccine design.In general, efforts to design more broadly protective influenza vaccines have sought to accentuate the conserved features of the HA protein. This includes methods to re-direct immune responses to the immunosubdominant stem domain, such as the use of “headless” HA, heterologous vaccination with different influenza subtypes, and chimeric HA containing mixed head-stem combinations32,33,34,35,36. Other attempts have engineered glycosylation sites to direct antibody responses away from the more variable regions37,38,39. The COBRA methodology is distinct from these approaches through its lack of specific predetermined antigenic targets within the HA. Rather, it relies on the input of sequence data from a target set of viruses to design a consensus that broadly represents those viruses, essentially predicting the protein of a hypothetical virus that bears traits of those within the design space. This presents two possible mechanisms that could account for the broad antibody responses observed for COBRA HA vaccines: (1) the elicitation of broadly reactive polyclonal antibody responses that target different epitopes in diverse viruses, or (2) the elicitation of broadly reactive antibodies that target conserved features. The structural and biochemical data presented here suggests that P1 may exhibit a degree of both.The structural features of the classical head antigenic sites in COBRA P1 generally correlates with those of strains it is known to protect against. This is consistent with sequence-based analyses that have focused on residues in the vicinity of the Sa site13. Specifically, the presence or absence of Lys130 and glycosylation at residues 125 or 127 have been identified as “signatures” marking a divide between virus lineages in relation to the potency of antibody protection. Lys130 is present in pandemic-related sequences, including the 1918 and 2009 strains, whereas it is absent in many non-pandemic seasonal viruses such as SI/3/06. It structurally forms part of the outer boundary of the RBS, suggesting it could influence the way that RBS antibodies bind to block sialic acid receptor access13 (Fig. 6a). Glycosylation on residues 125 or 127 have the potential to shield epitopes in or around the Sa region of the HA head. Here we demonstrated that glycosylation on residue 127, specifically, interferes with the ability of antibody CA09-15 to bind P1.Interestingly, the Asn127 glycosylation site present in P1 is a rare feature among circulating viruses. While this glycosylation site appears in a number of historic virus sequences, the most recent confirmed occurrence is the A/Mongolia/231/85 strain isolated in 198540 (Supplementary Table 1). This glycan, along with several others, emerged among seasonal influenza strains in the decades following the 1918 pandemic. Compared to Asn125 glycosylation, which ultimately replaced it, the Asn127 glycan is more effective at evading polyclonal antibodies from mice immunized with pandemic H1N1 vaccines40. Conversely, immunization by a pandemic strain incorporating this glycosylation site resulted in more broadly reactive polyclonal antibody responses. When considered with other data showing similar impact of modifying vaccine glycosylation in H5N141, this suggests that specific glycosylation sites in influenza hemagglutinin proteins may warrant particular attention for rational vaccine design.Given the immune evasive properties of the Asn127 glycan, it may seem counterintuitive as to why it dropped out of circulating strains. There are a couple of potential factors that could play a role in the loss, and lack of re-acquisition, of this site. One is the level of sequence conservation inherent to this region of HA. Residues 127–130 tend to be variable across H1N1 virus sequences, whereas Asn125 and His126 are highly conserved across many strains42. From a statistical standpoint, this may present an advantage for glycosylation on Asn125 since only a single variable amino acid needs to fall into place to acquire the NXT motif, whereas residue 127 requires the coincidence of two or three variable amino acids to generate the motif. In addition, it is possible that there could be selective pressure against the predominance of the 127 glycan. Spatially, glycosylation at position 127 would be closer to the receptor binding site compared to Asn125. Although this likely provides more shielding against some neutralizing antibodies, a potential drawback could be less efficient access for receptor binding. This would be consistent with observations that HA head glycosylation sometimes impacts influenza virus infectivity40,43,44.In the context of vaccine design, Asn127 in P1 highlights the ability of the COBRA methodology to incorporate even some less common structural features from a pool of input sequences, demonstrating the power to represent diverse viruses. Additionally, at a functional level this glycan shields a potentially variable epitope that results in more broadly protective polyclonal antibody responses, while also being permissive of access to the RBS by broadly neutralizing antibodies such as 1F8.1F8 stands out among structurally characterized RBS-targeting antibodies. The rare usage of CDRL1 to form the primary contact with the epitope positions the antibody in a distinct orientation from that of other RBS antibodies, resulting in a previously unobserved, atypical mode of binding. This engagement of the light chain with the RBS allows the heavy chain to interact with the Ca2 antigenic site to bolster the interaction. Prior to the discovery of 1F8, no antibodies from mice were reported in the literature that possessed both the same gene usage and reactivity profile. Although another antibody, 3D10, has been identified that utilizes the same VH germline gene, it lacks functional similarity to 1F8, being both non-neutralizing and having a narrower specificity11. The combined engagement achieved by 1F8 with the RBS and Ca2 accounts for both the broad reactivity and limitations in the breadth of binding7, as the RBS provides a conserved point of interaction while Ca2 in different HAs exhibits a range of favorable, tolerable, and conflicting levels of compatibility with 1F8. In principle, this mode of binding could allow for a constant usage of the light chain for RBS engagement that is paired with different heavy chains to optimize binding with Ca2. Interestingly, while this manuscript was in revision, a structure of another mouse-derived antibody, 12H5, was reported which shows a similar mode of binding with the head domain of CA/04/09 HA45 (Fig. 8). As predicted by our hypothesis, while sharing a common germline lineage for the light chain that results in a high degree of similarity to 1F8, 12H5 utilizes an alternate germline gene for the heavy chain that results in very different interactions with Ca2 that may be more optimal for binding with CA/04/09.Fig. 8: Comparison of 1F8 and 12H5 binding characteristics.The P1-1F8 and CA/04/09-12H5 (PDB entry 7FAH) structures were aligned based on the secondary structure structural alignment of the HA head domains. Overall structural representations are presented as cartoons of a monomeric HA bound to the Fab version of the antibody. Closeup views of the binding interfaces in the RBS, Ca2 antigenic site, and the region near residue 127 regions are depicted, with electrostatic interactions depicted by orange dashes. Comparisons of the CDR regions in germline antibody lineages versus antibodies 1F8 and 12H5 are shown.Full size imageThese two independent discoveries of a new class of broadly neutralizing antibody raises the question as to how these types of antibodies are elicited. Comparing the vaccination strategies utilized reveals contrasting approaches. While 1F8 was generated by a prime-boost regimen with a recombinant P1-expressing virus11, 12H5 was discovered after sequential immunization with three separate historical virus strains45. This has major implications in two ways. First, it emphasizes how the computationally designed P1, as a single antigen, elicits native antibody responses that are comparable with immunization from multiple wildtype strains. Second, it suggests that the generation of 1F8-like antibodies in mice may be a relatively common occurrence. This is supported by an analysis of antibody germline lineages, as searching for similar light chain sequences reveals close matches with the mouse germline genes IGKV3-4 and IGKV3-3, which possess YD and YN, respectively, in CDRL1 that aligns with the FD motif in 1F8 (Supplementary Table 2)46. Whether similar antibodies are present in human repertoires remains to be determined. Although no human light chain antibody sequences contain a chemically similar motif, with the closest match for the CDRL1, germline gene IGKV2-24, possessing SD at the corresponding amino acid positions, the FD motif could be generated by somatic hypermutation. Moreover, human antibody repertoires might be able to achieve a similar effect by means of an alternate mode of binding. Overall, the 1F8 structure sheds light on an additional means of attaining broad neutralization that could have applications for rational antibody design. It further emphasizes the effectiveness of computationally designed HA antigens, such as P1, in eliciting native antibody responses that are equivalent to heterologous immunization with wildtype antigens.One potential limitation in evaluating the effectiveness of COBRA HA antigenicity stems from the fact that vaccine studies to this point have been restricted to preclinical animal models. While these have demonstrated the effectiveness of COBRA HA in both naïve and pre-immune models10,47, more data is needed to ascertain how it translates to human populations with more diverse genetic backgrounds and complex exposure histories. Recent studies have provided encouraging hints on this front, however, identifying broadly reactive antibodies in human vaccine cohorts that are cross-reactive with COBRA HAs19,48. This suggests that COBRA HAs retain structural elements capable of recalling existing protective antibody responses, while potentially broadening the immune response against additional strains.The structural features observed with COBRA P1 naturally raises questions pertaining to optimal vaccine design. In what ways does it inform the future development of better antigens? One aspect highlighted by the structures is the distinction between sequence identity and structural similarity. Though related to each other, the sequence alone lacks clear spatial information to properly contextualize the impact of amino acid differences. This particularly applies to the composition of antigenic regions and the relative importance of individual residues in antibody binding interfaces. While sequence-based analysis has benefits from ease of use in a design pipeline, a more ideal approach is the incorporation of tertiary structural characteristics for more accurate measures of antigenic similarity. This includes the ability to ascertain the structural boundaries that demarcate between different lineages of viruses, such as seasonal viruses like SI/3/06 and pandemic-related such as CA/04/09, to understand the intrinsic limitations to the scope of protective antibodies that can be generated by a given antigen. In addition, the COBRA P1 structure demonstrates the ability to identify specific features, such as glycosylation at residue 127, that have a propensity to induce broader antibody responses and be of interest for deliberate incorporation in future generations of antigen design. Overall, the structural data enhances our understanding of the relationship between antigenic features and antibody protection and supports a paradigm of structure-based vaccine design.In conclusion, the structures of COBRA P1 and 1F8 uncover crucial insights into the underlying molecular basis for the broad effectiveness of P1. This provides a framework to understand how COBRA HAs elicit protective antibodies against diverse viruses and the general effectiveness when compared to wildtype antigens. This further informs the rational antigen design process and progress towards the development of more effective next-generation influenza vaccines.MethodsExpression and purification of COBRA P1 HA in insect cellsA codon-optimized synthetic gene encoding the COBRA P1 HA ectodomain was cloned into the pBacPAK8 vector (GenScript). A thrombin cleavage site, T4 fibritin Foldon trimerization domain, hexahistidine tag, and StrepTag II were encoded at the C-terminus. To ensure efficient secretion in the Sf9 baculovirus expression system, the gene was designed with a gp67 signal peptide sequence in place of the native secretion signal. The DNA plasmid was resuspended according to the manufacturer’s instructions and transformed into DH5α E. coli cells. A single colony was picked and used to inoculate a 5 mL LB overnight culture and subsequently midiprepped (Macherey-Nagel). Baculovirus was generated with the flashBAC™ system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Mirus Bio). To induce expression, 2 L of Sf9 cells at a density of 3.8 × 106 cells/mL were infected with ~23 mL of virus solution per liter of culture. The expression was continued for 4 days and the media harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was sequentially filtered through glass microfiber, 0.45 μm, and 0.22 μm filters, then concentrated to approximately 150 mL by tangential flow with a VivaFlow® 200 (Sartorius). The sample was supplemented with 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], and 1 mM EDTA (final concentrations), then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The clarified sample was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter and loaded onto two 5 mL StrepTrap columns connected in series (GE Healthcare). The columns were washed with 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, and the protein was eluted with a gradient to 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM desthiobiotin on an ÄKTA Pure Chromatography system (GE Healthcare). The eluted protein was concentrated to approximately 4 mg/mL with a VivaSpin 50,000 MWCO concentrator, supplemented with glycerol to 5%, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further use.Crystallization and structural solution of COBRA P1 from insect cellsFrozen, affinity-purified P1 was thawed on ice. A thrombin digestion was performed overnight at 4 °C to remove the Foldon trimerization domain and tags. The digestion product was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 16/600 column to separate the HA and Foldon, as well as buffer exchange into 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris [pH 7.5]. Fractions containing trimeric HA were pooled and concentrated to 10.2 mg/mL. The sample was screened with the MCSG Crystallization Suite (Anatrace) by sitting drop vapor diffusion using a Crystal Gryphon Robot (Art Robbins Instruments). Approximately 30 hits were observed 0–7 days after the initial screen. MCSG4 condition F4 (0.2 M MgCl2, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 16% PEG 4000) successfully reproduced hexagonal-shaped crystals in manually set hanging drops that diffracted poorly (7–10 Å). The condition was further optimized using an Additive Screen (Hampton Research). Drops containing the additives PEG 400, Polypropylene glycol P 400, and Jeffamine M-600 pH 7 resulted in crystals with a different morphology (rectangular plates) that improved the diffraction. The final optimized condition contained 0.25 M MgCl2, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 15% PEG 4000, 6% PEG 400. The crystal was cryoprotected in a solution consisting of 0.25 M MgCl2, 0.1 Tris pH 8.5, 15% PEG 4000, 6% ethylene glycol, 6% DMSO, 6% glycerol and subsequently flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data was collected using the JBluIce Graphical User Interface at the GM/CA beamline 23ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source. Data from a single crystal was processed in the CCP4 suite, using DIALS (version 2.2) for indexing and integration and AIMLESS for scaling and merging49,50,51. Molecular replacement was performed with Phaser in the PHENIX suite (version 1.19) using a computationally generated structure as the search model52. Six monomer copies were placed in the asymmetric unit, forming two intact trimers. The structure was refined with alternating rounds of manual and global buildingefinement in COOT (version 0.9.8) and PHENIX53,54. The model was validated with Privateer and Molprobity55,56. Figures were made in PyMOL (version 2.3.0)57. The processed data and refined model have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 7UYI. The residue numbering used in the model is based on the H1N1pdm numbering scheme58.Generation of the COBRA P1 N127D mutantA plasmid encoding the COBRA P1 gene in vector pcDNA 3.1 (constructed as previously described59) was used as a template to generate the N127D mutant by site-directed mutagenesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific and New England Biolabs). Briefly, 5’ phosphorylated primers were designed to introduce a point mutation in the COBRA P1 (Integrated DNA Technologies). PCR reactions were set up with Phusion polymerase (NEB Biolabs) according to the Phusion site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following digestion with DpnI, the PCR product was circularized with T4 ligase (New England Biolabs) and transformed into DH5α E. coli cells. Mutated plasmid was miniprepped (Machery-Nagel) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing (GeneWiz).Expression and purification of COBRA P1 and COBRA P1 N127D for binding assaysThe P1 wt and P1 N127D genes were cloned into a derivative of pcDNA3.1 optimized for protein expression in CHO cells60. The proteins were produced in CHO cells as previously described61. The harvested supernatants were supplemented with an approximately equivalent volume of Buffer A (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaH2PO4 [pH 8.0]), filtered, and loaded onto 5 mL HisTrap columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer A. The columns were washed with Buffer A, then the protein eluted with a gradient to Buffer B (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM imidazole [pH 8.0]). The fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBS. The presence and purity of the HA was confirmed by SDS-PAGE.Purification of monoclonal antibody CA09-11The monoclonal antibody CA09-11 in mouse ascites was obtained through BEI Resources (Item# NR-28667). For purification, the sample was diluted in excess PBS and loaded onto a 5 mL Protein G HiTrap column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with PBS and the protein eluted with 0.1 M Glycine-HCl [pH 2.03]. To neutralize the pH, 110 μL of 1.89 M Tris pH 8 was added to each 2 mL fraction. The fractions containing the peak were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBS. The protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE to check purity and quantified using an assumed extinction coefficient of 1.4 g/L and a 150 kD molecular weight.Purification of monoclonal antibody CA09-15 and Fab generationThe monoclonal antibody CA09-15 in mouse ascites was obtained through BEI Resources (Item# NR-28668). For purification, the sample was diluted in excess Protein A IgG Binding Buffer (Thermo Scientific) and added to a gravity flow column containing 0.5 mL of packed Protein A resin equilibrated with Binding Buffer. The column was washed with 3 mL of Binding Buffer, then the protein eluted with 3 mL of Protein A IgG Elution Buffer (Thermo Scientific) divided into three fractions. To neutralize the pH, 100 μL of 1 M Tris pH 8.5 was added to each 1 mL fraction. The presence of antibody was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, then the first two fractions combined and concentrated. CA09-15 mAb for BLI studies was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBS and quantified using an assumed extinction coefficient of 1.4 g/L and a 150 kD molecular weight.Fab fragments were generated and purified using the Pierce™ Fab Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Scientific) and the resulting product was further polished by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in PBS. The protein was quantified using an assumed extinction coefficient of 1.4 g/L and a 50 kD molecular weight.Expression and purification of Fab 1F8The variable regions of the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain sequence of 1F8 were determined as previously described11. In brief, total RNA was extracted from the corresponding 1F8 hybridoma cell line using the RNeasy MINI kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a pool of previously described primers62 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequences of amplified VH and VL fragments were analyzed using the IMGT database63. Synthetic genes to produce recombinant Fab 1F8 were cloned into the pCI-Neo vector (GenScript). The variable domain of the light chain was designed in frame with a mouse kappa constant region, and the variable domain of the heavy chain with a mouse IgG1 CH1 domain containing a C-terminal thrombin cleavage site and TwinStrep tag. The protein was produced in CHO cells as previously described61. Post-expression, the media (~120 mL) was harvested and buffer adjusted with concentrated NaCl, Tris [pH 8.0], and EDTA to final concentrations of 150 mM, 50 mM, and 1 mM, respectively. To eliminate the impact of biotin in the media, 5 mL of BioLock (IBA Life Sciences) was mixed with the buffered media and filtered with a 0.22 μm filter. The sample was loaded onto a 5 mL StrepTrap column equilibrated with 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA. The column was washed, then the protein eluted with a 10 CV gradient to 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 6.5 mM desthiobiotin. The fractions containing the protein were thrombin digested overnight to remove the tag, then further purified using a Superdex 200 10/300 column equilibrated with 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris [pH 7.5]. The fractions containing the Fab were pooled and concentrated, then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use.Biolayer interferometry binding experimentsBiolayer interferometry data was collected on an Octet RED384 using the Data Acquisition Software (version 11.1.1.19). Binding experiments were performed in Assay Buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20). For initial binding studies, mAbs 3G6, 5B-2A12, 163-20 and CA09-11 and CA09-15 were diluted to 100 nM and 50 nM in assay buffer. Additional assays with the mAb and Fab versions of CA09-15 were performed with antibody concentrations ranging from 1350 nM to 50 nM. For Fab 1F8, assays were run with antibody concentrations ranging from 15 nM to 0.556 nM. All samples were run in duplicate (Supplementary Figs. 4–6, 8 and 9). Assays were performed with the temperature set to 30 °C and the plate shaking at 1000 rpm. To run the assays, anti-Penta-His biosensors soaked in Assay Buffer were equilibrated for 2 min in buffer. Subsequently, HA antigen at a nominal concentration of 10 μg/mL was loaded onto anti-Penta-His biosensors for 5 min. Following loading, the biosensors were returned to Assay Buffer for 2 min to obtain a baseline, then dipped into antibody samples for 5 min to measure association. Dissociation was measured by returning to Assay Buffer for 10 min. For mAb CA09-15, additional assays were performed loading the mAb onto AMC (anti-Mouse-Fc-capture) biosensors at 2 μg/mL for 5 min, with P1 wt or P1 N127D present as the analyte in concentrations ranging from 450 to 50 nM. Kinetics calculations were performed using the Octet Data Analysis HT software v7 (Sartorius). Each replicate was reference subtracted with a no antibody control, aligned to the baseline, and aligned to either the baseline or dissociation steps for inter-step correction. The initial assays with 3G6, 5B-2A12, 163-20, CA09-11 and CA09-15 as well as the full dilution assay of mAb CA09-15 with P1 N127D were fit using a 1:2 (bivalent analyte) binding model. The full assays with mAb CA09-15 and P1 wt fit best with a 2:1 (heterogenous ligand) model to account for the biphasic nature of dissociation, as well as the assays utilizing immobilized mAb CA09-15. Assays using Fab CA09-15 were fit with a 1:1 model of binding. For Fab 1F8, the data fit best using a 1:1 model with mass transport limitation due to the rapid association rates. The traces for each run were fit globally for curves in each dilution series. Model fits were evaluated and optimized based on visual inspection and the R2, χ2, and individual KD error values. Average KD values are reported as the mean of two independent experiments.Cryo-electron microscopy of the P1-1F8 complexCOBRA P1 used for electron microscopy studies was expressed and purified as described previously59. P1, 1F8, and the anchor antibody P1-0519 were combined in a 1:3:3 molar ratio and incubated at room temperature for 1 h to form complex. To freeze grids, octyl-β-glucoside (Anatrace) was added to samples at a final concentration of 0.1%. HA-Fab complex at 0.8 mg/mL was immediately deposited onto glow-discharged 1.2/1.3 quantifoil 400 mesh grids (EMS). The grids were blotted and frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (FEI), then transferred to liquid nitrogen for storage. Images were collected on a Titan Krios (FEI) with a Gatan K2 summit detector operating at 300 kV. A total of 1212 micrographs were collected in counting mode at a nominal magnification of 130,000, 1.045 Å/pixel, with Leginon64. The total exposure time was 6.8 s, with a total dose of 50.1 electrons/Å2. Data processing was performed with CRYOSPARC265. Following motion correction and CTF estimation with GCTF66, particles were picked with the Cryosparc template picker. The particles were cleaned up by multiple rounds of 2D classification, followed by homogenous and heterogenous refinements. Due to the flexibility, poor reconstruction, and lack of specific interest in the details of Fab P1-05 for this manuscript, this antibody was masked out to focus on COBRA P1 and 1F8. Due to sub-stoichiometric quantities of bound Fab 1F8, the data was processed in C1 symmetry to preserve the overall quality of the two Fabs visible in the reconstruction. Multiple rounds of non-uniform, global CTF, and local CTF refinements yielded a final map with an overall resolution of 3.1 Å. Starting models were placed into the map in COOT. For COBRA P1, the X-ray crystal structure was used as the initial model. For 1F8, a model containing the Fv regions was generated with ROSIE67,68,69,70. Following model placement, alternating rounds of manual and global real space refinement were performed in COOT (version 0.9.8) and PHENIX (version 1.20)71,72. The model was validated in Molprobity, PHENIX, and EMRinger56,73,74,75. Figures were made in ChimeraX (version 1.2.5) and PyMOL (version 2.3.0)57,76. The map has been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank with accession number EMD-26983, and the refined model in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 8CT6.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

But experts have their eye on the threat it could potentially pose to humans.Veterinarians first identified influenza D in pigs in 2011 and later sleuthed out the virus’s primary host: cattle. Scientists have since been watching for any signs that this bovine flu is infecting humans, as flus from birds and pigs sometimes do. There’s currently no definitive proof, but there are worrying hints that human infection is possible—and that if luck favored the virus on a couple key fronts, it could begin spreading among people.“I think it’s fair to say that influenza D has everything it needs to infect humans from a scientific standpoint,” says Feng Li, a virologist at the University of Kentucky, who helped identify the virus as a new type of influenza.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

The flu vaccines distributed in the U.S. each fall are tuned to two strains each of influenza A and B. Influenza C is very common but typically mild, except for some cases in infants, and there is no vaccine for it. Influenza D is the most recently identified type and the only one that has not been confirmed to infect humans.Influenza D is believed to be most prevalent in cattle. A nationwide survey in 2014 and 2015 showed that about 75 percent of the animals carried antibodies to the virus. It seems to cause only mild bovine infection, says Mayara Maggioli, a veterinary immunologist at Oklahoma State University. “It’s a very subtle disease,” she says. “It’s very well adapted.” Infected cattle can have symptoms that aren’t so different from the flu we all know: runny noses or eyes, increased heart and breathing rates and a fever, cough or reduced appetite. “It’s very similar to what we see in humans,” Maggioli says. Experiments have shown that inoculation can protect cattle from infection, but there is no commercially available vaccine for them.Whether humans can be infected with influenza D is less clear. “There’s evidence out there that suggests it might be happening, but it’s far from conclusive,” says Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Tennessee. “The data that’s out there could go either way.” NPR reported on the virus’s potential to jump to humans last month.Influenza D has scientists particularly concerned for people who spend long hours in close contact with cattle, especially in confined spaces. And recent research has found hints of the virus in this population. A 2022 study found viral particles on nasal swabs from cattle workers, but viruses can be present without actively infecting a person. A 2016 study found that cattle workers carried antibodies that reacted to influenza D, but influenza C is similar enough that antibodies for the latter can respond to the former as well, Webby says.Although scientists have plenty of experience monitoring potential influenza spillover from animals, those efforts have focused on birds and pigs—not cattle. That’s because avian and swine influenzas have caused pandemics in humans, including the 1918 flu pandemic, which was caused by a virus that originated in birds, and the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Bovine viruses, as far as scientists know, have never wreaked such havoc. An avian influenza recently infected nearly 60 million poultry birds in the U.S. but has only infected one human, and no cases have been reported in humans in the U.S. since April 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“From the flu perspective, certainly cows have never really been thought about in studies of spillover,” Webby says, although he notes that some groups are starting to investigate human-cattle interactions more closely. “It’s definitely an understudied interface. We absolutely need to know more about it.”If influenza D were to start infecting humans, the first sign would likely be respiratory symptoms in cattle industry workers—and even the studies that show potential human immune reactions to the virus haven’t documented any sick workers. The second key piece of information would be if people with no direct interaction with cattle began to get sick, which would suggest the virus was spreading among humans.Even if those two developments occurred, it’s not certain that influenza D would be disastrous among humans, especially given its relatively benign effects on cattle. “In a human, I think probably, disease-wise, it should be mild,” Li says. But “as we all know, Mother Nature cannot be predicted.”All three experts Scientific American spoke with say there’s no guarantee the virus won’t eventually start infecting humans. “We’ve absolutely got to treat it with respect. We’ve absolutely got to learn more about it,” Webby says. “You can’t say there’s no risk of this virus at all. I think that would be a naive statement.”Rights & PermissionsMeghan Bartels is a science journalist based in New York City.

Coping strategies that can help / Staying Healthy Why do we need new flu shots every year? April 23, 2023 By Anthony L. Komaroff, MD, Editor in Chief, Harvard Health Letter; Editorial Advisory Board Member, Harvard Health Publishing Ask the doctor Q. It's flu shot time again. With all of these new ways of making vaccines, why do we still need a new shot each year? Why can't we get one flu shot that will protect us for the rest of our lives? A. Many scientists are working on developing just such a "universal" vaccine for the influenza (flu) virus. Why do we need a new shot every year? The influenza virus, like every virus, contains a set of genes that are wrapped in a coat of protein. Vaccines typically stimulate the production of antibodies that attach to outer structures on the protein coat, disabling the virus; indeed, that's how the influenza vaccine works. Unfortunately, these outer structures are constantly changing, so a new vaccine is needed each year to target those structures on the flu viruses that are currently circulating. In recent years, scientists have found inner structures in the influenza virus protein coat that are the same in all strains of flu viruses. Universal vaccines that target those inner structures hold the promise of protecting against different types of influenza virus, eliminating the need for a new shot every year. Even more important than avoiding the hassle of an annual flu shot, a universal flu vaccine could be ready immediately and in large quantities — without the usual multi-month delay needed to create and produce a vaccine — when a deadly new pandemic flu virus emerges, as history says it will. I'm optimistic that remarkable scientific progress under way will give us a universal flu vaccine in the future. Image: © simarik/Getty Images About the Author Anthony L.

The virus is grown in the chorio-allantoic membrane which surrounds the embryo of a fertilized egg in a well-established process that has been in use for decades. Prior to COVID-19, vaccines were not a hot topic, nor were they frequently seen as a lucrative business prospect. It was well accepted that more modern processes could be used for influenza vaccine production, but innovation in this space has been slow for a variety of reasons, including the old adage: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it (especially if the latter needs investment).” That said, some companies were starting to evaluate other options, including a shift from egg-based to cell-culture based vaccines. One example of innovation in this field is Flublok – a protein-based vaccine made in insect cells. According to Piergiuseppe Nestola, Manager of Process Technology Consultants at Sartorius, the influenza vaccine has always been a key vaccine to optimize and improve, particularly in terms of the manufacturing process. “Egg-based processes are slow and require huge facility footprints, which are also becoming unfavorable as more attention is paid to sustainability. In terms of development, strain selection is a challenge too. There is a limited window of time from when the yearly influenza strain is detected, which puts pressure on the process. It’s not unusual in influenza for the strain selected to ultimately not end up being the one circulating with high prevalence during the winter seasons.” Explaining one of the biggest disadvantages of traditional egg-based processes, Joseph Payne, CEO, President, and Co-Founder of Arcturus Therapeutics, which is developing mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics, points to another element of speed. “The term in the vaccine industry that is extraordinarily important is ‘clock speed.’ The World Health Organization (WHO) and other non-profit organizations will publicly share the strains of concern – and then vaccine producers design, manufacture, and distribute the vaccine in time for the flu season.”Recognizing the challenges, some companies were already taking action. The famous Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine actually has its roots in influenza innovation efforts, with the companies agreeing their first partnership in 2018. In 2020, the companies agreed to expand their collaboration to the far more pressing threat of COVID-19. The story of the COVID-19 collaboration is history, but what of influenza? The work continues – with volunteers recruited for a phase III clinical trial last year. Ultimately, they hope that an mRNA-based method will be faster to develop and manufacture, thus achieving more accurate matching against circulating strains. Several companies are now keenly exploring the potential of mRNA. One key area of interest is combining influenza and COVID-19 vaccines in a single shot. “Other clinical trials are looking at combining different subtypes of influenza (A and B) to develop a broadly protective vaccine or, in some cases, even a universal flu vaccine, thus avoiding the risk of not having selected the right strain for the next flu season. It could help adoption of this vaccine and facilitate its production, while also reducing the frequency of the booster injections,” says Nestola. “Of course, the industry still needs more data to assess the feasibility of mRNA in terms of immune response and whether re-optimization of LNP formulations is required for influenza. Nevertheless, mRNA vaccines have proven their superiority in terms of manufacturing speed (it takes around 24 hours to manufacture a batch of mRNA, compared to 2–3 weeks for a cell culture based process). These aspects taken together bring a potentially strong competitive advantage for mRNA. Time will tell if the immune response against other disease targets will be as good as what we saw for COVID-19 or if we need a toolbox to work with different disease targets.” For Payne, the benefit of mRNA lies in its ability to reduce the critical clock speed. “mRNA makes it much faster to design and manufacture the vaccine. At Arcturus, we are finding that next generation mRNA, such as self-amplifying mRNA, may offer even more benefits too – such as lower doses that are much more efficient from a manufacturing perspective because one manufacturing run generates so many more doses.” We spoke with companies to find out how they are innovating in influenza – from making monoclonal antibodies, to mRNA – and beyond. Check out the articles below… Hitting a Moving Target Influenza viruses A and B are a major public health concern, mainly affecting the pharynx, trachea, and sometimes the lungs of millions of people worldwide each year. Symptoms of flu can range from mild to life-threatening, and alongside seasonal outbreaks (which tend to prevail over the winter months) there is also the looming threat of pandemic influenza strains. Here, Holge Hannemann, Director of Research at The Native Antigen Company, explores the challenges associated with flu vaccine development – and the emerging technologies hoping to tackle them.A Day in Egg City Here are seven things that The Medicine Maker learned during a visit to Britain’s largest flu vaccine factory: Seqirus in Liverpool.

The genesis of Centivax dates back to around 2012, when Jacob Glanville was building a previous company called Distributed Bio, which was using computational immunology to identify new therapeutic antibodies to target specific protein sites. However, the tools the company was developing also provided better insights into immune systems – such as the induction of autoimmunity and the failure of vaccines for quickly mutating viruses.

Several influenza pandemics have occurred during the last century and estimated to have caused 100 million deaths. There are four genera of IV, A (IVA), B (IVB), C (IVC), and D (IVD), with IVA being the most virulent to the human population. Hemagglutinin (HA) is an IVA surface protein that allows the virus to attach to host cell receptors and enter the cell. Here we have characterised the high-resolution structures of seven IVA HAs, with one in complex with the anti-influenza head-binding antibody C05. Our analysis revealed conserved receptor binding residues in all structures, as seen in previously characterised IV HAs. Amino acid conservation is more prevalent on the stalk than the receptor binding domain (RBD; also called the head domain), allowing the virus to escape from antibodies targeting the RBD. The equivalent site of C05 antibody binding to A/Denver/57 HA appears hypervariable in the other H1N1 IV HAs. Modifications within this region appear to disrupt binding of the C05 antibody, as these HAs no longer bind the C05 antibody by analytical SEC. Our study brings new insights into the structural and functional recognition of IV HA proteins and can contribute to further development of anti-influenza vaccines.

It is estimated that around 10% of the global population is infected annually, with an economic burden of more than $87 billion (USD) on the healthcare system2. It is estimated that each year IV causes around 300–600 thousand deaths worldwide3. Humans have experienced several influenza pandemics in the last century. The most severe include Spanish (1918–1919), Asian (1957–1958), and Hong Kong (1968–1970) influenza, that cumulatively caused around 100 million deaths. Most recently, the 2009–2010 influenza pandemic (swine flu) resulted in 284,000 deaths2,4.IV is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family of segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. There are four genera of IVs, A (IVA), B (IVB), C (IVC), and D (IVD). The genomes of IVA and IVB consist of eight RNA segments while the genomes of IVC and IVD consist of seven RNA segments, enveloped by a phospholipid bilayer derived from the host membrane. These segments encode for a variety of structural and non-structural proteins5. In IVA and IVB, two of these structural proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are inserted into the phospholipid bilayer as spikes6. HA is responsible for viral attachment, entry, and fusion into host cells, while NA cleaves the cell receptor to facilitate viral release1. In IVC and IVD, there is only a single spike protein, hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF), which is responsible for both viral attachment and release7.In IVA there are 18 HA subtypes, phylogenetically divided into two groups. Mammalian IVA infection is initiated through HAs binding to α2,6 sialic acid-linkage galactose receptors on the host cell surface, before entering the cell via endocytosis1. Following endocytosis, HAs undergo conformational rearrangements due to the low pH of the endosome, leading to membrane fusion8,9. Influenza HA is synthesised as an immature precursor (HA0) that must be proteolytically cleaved into HA1 and HA2 polypeptides for the activation of membrane fusion, and a recent study characterized the structural differences of HA0 at neutral and low pH compared to HA1/HA2 at low pH10. Notably, the most commonly observed HA structure in the public database is the cleaved HA1/HA2 assembly at neutral pH. HA is a homotrimeric glycoprotein, with each monomer composed of two regions: (1) the head, comprising the receptor binding domain (RBD) which is crucial in viral attachment, and (2) the stalk, that is responsible for viral and cell membrane fusion in the endosome11,12. While the head contains a sialic acid binding pocket and plays the key antigenic role12,13, it has been shown that several antibodies can also recognise antigenic motifs on the stalk14.The stalk is now being investigated for vaccine design as it is highly conserved in both IVA and IVB15. Constant antigenic drift causes a hypervariable area on the RBD, thus influenza vaccines targeting this area are inefficient. However, some anti-influenza antibodies, such as C05 and F045-092, have overcome this variation and can bind several IV strains within and across subtypes14. Some stalk-binding antibodies can also neutralise a wide range of IV strains. For instance, FI6v3 can neutralise all IVA strains and CR9114 can neutralise all IVA and IVB strains14,16. These conserved epitopes in the RBD and stalk look promising for designing a universal vaccine with higher effectiveness against circulating pathogenic IV strains. Recent advances in computational antigen design have generated new avenues for vaccine development against multiple IVA and IVB strains17,18,19.Understanding HA structural variation across IVA and IVB strains is critical for antibody therapy and vaccine design, especially the hypervariability in the RBD which can lead to ineffective immune responses. As such, we characterised the crystal structures of HA from six H1 subtype IVA strains, with variations in the RBD. In addition, we determined the crystal structure of A/Denver/57 HA in complex with the anti-influenza antibody C05 fragment antigen binding (Fab). The structure and sequence of all seven HAs were then analysed to highlight similarities and differences. This study provides further insights into HA spike proteins from one of the most critical IV subtypes and expands our knowledge of HA structure and antibody binding.Materials and methodsCloning, expression, and purification of C05 FabC05 Fab was expressed and secreted from mammalian HEK293 cells (ThermoFisher; catalog R79007) in FreeStyle 293 media with PEI induction. The expressed protein construct contains a C-terminal non-cleavable His6 tag on the heavy chain. The protein was initially purified by nickel affinity chromatography on a HisTrap nickel Excel column in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl (Buffer A) supplemented with 500 mM imidazole Buffer B) with a 5–60% Buffer G linear gradient. The eluted protein was concentrated from ~ 0.1 to 1.26 mg/mL, then further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 in 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. C05 Fab protein was then concentrated to 9.94 mg/mL and stored at − 80 °C prior to crystallisation.Cloning, expression, and purification of IVA HAsFull length IVA H1N1 HAs were cloned from synthetic genes into vectors for expression in baculovirus infected insect cells (obtained from Expression Systems: website https://expressionsystems.com/products/cells) using a general expression and purification protocol described previously20. All IV open reading frames were cloned into a pBac vector with ampicillin resistance, encoding an N-terminal GP67 secretion sequence (sequence: MVLVNQSHQGFNKEHTSKMVSAIVLYVLLAAAAHSAFAGS) and a C-terminal thrombin-cleavable trimerisation domain followed by a His6 affinity tag (sequence: EFLVPRGSPGSGYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFLGHHHHHH). IVA HAs were expressed in baculovirus infected T. ni insect cells (obtained from Expression Systems: website https://expressionsystems.com/products/cells) (3% virus) using ESF-921 media and were harvested after 2 days. Media containing the secreted protein was buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and concentrated from 5 to 1 L using a Tangential Flow Filtration system. The protein was purified via nickel affinity chromatography on a Ni HiTrap chelating column. The eluted HA0 protein was treated with trypsin to generate mature HA (HA1 and HA2 polypeptides) and to remove the C-terminal trimerisation domain with His6 affinity tag. The protein was next purified by subtractive nickel affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. The protein was concentrated to ~ 10 mg/mL and stored at − 80 °C prior to crystallisation.The head of A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947 HA was cloned from a synthetic gene into a pET28a vector with kanamycin resistance, encoding an N-terminal thrombin-cleavable His6 tag (sequence: MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRG). The head domain was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (from New England Biolabs, catalog number C2527H) in TB media overnight at 25 °C with 1 mM IPTG induction. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication, then clarified in 250 mL of 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 protease inhibitor tablet, 100 mg Lysozyme, 250 U Benzonase. Triton X-100 was added to 0.5% final concentration. The inclusion bodies were washed twice with 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM beta mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, then twice with 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM beta mercaptoethanol. The inclusion bodies were solubilised in 6 M guanidinium-HCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM beta mercaptoethanol. The protein was purified via nickel affinity chromatography on a HisTrap nickel Excel column and then refolded by dialysis over 2 days, initially with 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 0.4 M l-arginine, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG), 1 mM reduced glutathione (GSH), then with 25 mM Tris pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl. The His6 tag was removed by incubation with thrombin for 4 h on ice. The refolded protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column in 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl. The protein was concentrated to 5.04 mg/mL and stored at − 80 °C prior to crystallisation. Yield was 2.1 mg from 1.86 L of media.Complex formation analysis by analytical size exclusion chromatographyHA/C05 Fab complex formation was analysed by analytical scale size exclusion chromatography (anSEC). A Superose 6 analytical column was used on an Agilent 1100 HPLC with a running buffer of 25 mM Tris pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl. Molecular weight standards were run before and after samples.Crystallisation and structure determinationIV HAs were crystallised at ~ 10 mg/mL using the sitting drop vapour diffusion method at 287 K in either Compact Jr or MRC crystallisation trays. Trays were set up either manually with 0.4/0.4 mL drop size or using a Formulatrix NT8 or TTP Mosquito drop setting robot with 0.2/0.2 mL drop size. Crystals were formed under the conditions provided in Supplementary Table 1. Crystals were harvested and flash‐frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K the Advanced Light Source beamline 5.0.2 at 1.00 Å on a Dectris Pilatus3 S 6 M detector for A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947 trimer (7JPD) or Advanced Photon Source beamline 21 ID-G at 0.97856 Å for the A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947 refolded head domain (7JP4); all other X-ray data were collected at 100 K on a Rayonix MX‐300 mm CCD detector at a wavelength of 0.97872 Å on beamline 21‐ID‐F at Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LS‐CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS, Argonne, IL). Data were reduced with the XDS/XSCALE package21. Structures were solved using molecular replacement using MorDA by using PDB ID 5VLI or other structures as a starting model as shown in Supplemental Fig. 322. Models were built by iterative rounds of manual model building, and automated refinement was carried out using Coot23 and Phenix24. The quality of the structure was analysed using Molprobity25, and the final structure was deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB).ResultsStructural characterization of HA proteins from H1N1 IVA strainsThe structural presentation of IV HA proteins are important determinants of disease severity and antibody recognition. Therefore, to better understand the structural details of HA proteins of H1N1 IVA strains and inform vaccination strategies, a total of 25 H1N1 IVA strains were nominated to the structure determination pipeline of the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease26. Here we present the crystal structures of HAs from seven different H1N1 IVA strains (Supplementary Tables 2, 3). The full length mature HA1/HA2 trimer crystal structures are as follows: (1) A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947 solved at 2.95 Å resolution, (2) A/Jiangsu/ALS1/2011 solved at 2.35 Å resolution, (3) A/Almaty/32/1998 solved at 2.05 Å resolution, (4) A/Hickox/JY2/1940 solved at 1.95 Å resolution, (5) A/Netherlands/002P1/1951 solved at 2.5 Å resolution, and (6) A/Melbourne/1/1946 solved at 2.55 Å resolution. In addition, we also solved a 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of the refolded head of A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947, which appears quite similar to the lower resolution full length mature trimer structure (Supplemental Fig. 3). Although we were unable to solve the structure of the A/Denver/57/1957 trimer in isolation, we solved a 2.92 Å resolution structure of this HA bound to the head-binding antibody C05 Fab.A schematic overview of the various HA domains and their respective structures are shown in Fig. 1A,B, and here we use the structure of HA from A/Denver/57/1957 to illustrate the structural features. The immature, precursor form of HA (HA0) is 565 amino acids long and is cleaved into two main segments (HA1 and HA2) by trypsin-like proteases27,28,29,30,31. These HA1 and HA2 domains remain bound through an extensive network of interactions involving a disulfide bond between two conserved cysteines in the cleaved segments (Cys21 in the HA1 N-terminal domain and Cys480 in the HA2 C-terminal domain; Fig. 1A), in addition to 32 hydrogen bonds, 6 salt bridges, and a buried surface area of 2526 Å2 (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. 2). HA1 has three main domains. The fusion domain (red) comprises N-terminal (1–59) and C-terminal (278–325) segments of HA1 that are bound together to form part of the stalk. The vestigial esterase (VE) domain (yellow) also comprises both N-terminal (60–112) and C-terminal (266–277) segments of HA1, but forms part of the head domain (Fig. 1A). The function of the VE domain in IVA and IVB is not well defined, however it does share 54% homology with the 9-O-acetylesterase domain in IVC (32) that cleaves the host receptor to facilitate viral budding33. The RBD (green) is located in the middle of HA1 (113–265) and is responsible for binding to sialic acid receptors, as well as mediating the release of viral ribonucleoprotein particles (vRNPs) into the cytoplasm34,35. HA2 is comprised of two main domains (cyan), including a long ectodomain (335–500) that is responsible for viral fusion and a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) anchor at the end. Collectively, the RBD and VE domain comprise the head, and the fusion domain, ectodomain, and TM anchor comprise the stalk of HA. Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies (PISA)36 analysis predicted the biological assembly to be a trimer for all seven structures (Fig. 1C), however the number of interfacing residues was different between each (Supplementary Tables 4–10).Figure 1Influenza virus A hemagglutinin (HA) protein structure. (A) Schematic view of HA domains. F fusion domain (red), VE vestigial esterase domain (yellow), RBD receptor binding domain (green), TM anchor transmembrane anchor (cyan).

(C) Trimeric quaternary structure of HA, coloured by protomers.Full size imageThe RBD is positioned in the membrane-distal region of all three monomers of the HA trimer. The sialic acid binding pocket within the RBD comprises two main components, the base, consisting of four highly conserved residues (Tyr98, Trp153, His183, Tyr195; Fig. 2A, shown in dark pink), and the sides, involving the 130-loop (135–138), 190-helix (190–198), and 220-loop (221–228) (Fig. 2A, shown in grey). Structural alignment shows that the base residues are conserved in all seven HA structures (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the sides are present in all seven HA structures, however there are fewer conserved residues, particularly in the 220-loop.Figure 2Sialic acid binding pocket within the receptor binding domain of influenza virus A (IVA) hemagglutinin (HA).

Zoomed view to compare the positions of the putative sialic acid binding pocket residues.Full size imageThe stalk consists of the HA1 fusion domain, the HA2 ectodomain, and the TM anchor. The TM anchor is responsible for fusing to the endosomal membrane of the host cell37. HA1 and HA2 are linked via two Cys residues (Cys21 and Cys480) on the N-terminal of HA1 and C-terminal of HA2, as well as several hydrogen bonds (Supplementary Fig. 2).HA sequence alignment of the seven IVA strains (Fig. 3A) reveals greater conservation (highlighted red) in the stalk than the head. Importantly, the four sialic acid binding pocket residues are completely conserved in all strains (Fig. 3A, green circles). As highlighted through a sequence conservation mapped onto the HA structure (Fig. 3B), the majority of non-conserved residues are within the RBD (Fig. 3A, green line), which has the potential to affect the efficacy of head-binding antibodies against different IV strains. Antigenic motifs in H1N1 IVA strains have been previously studied due to H1N1 IVA prevalence in the human population. Thirty two residues in five antigenic regions within the HA head38,39 are shown in Fig. 3 (black dashes), with only eleven of the residues conserved in all seven strains.Figure 3Sequence conservation among hemagglutinins (HAs) of seven influenza virus A (IVA) strains. (A) Multiple sequence alignment of HA from seven IVA strains. The secondary structural elements of the A/Denver/57 strain (PDB ID: 6ML8) are shown above the alignment. Conserved residues are highlighted in red. Residues of the HA1 segment and HA2 segment are shown with a blue and orange line below the alignment, respectively. The purple dashed line shows the cleavage site between the HA1 and HA2 segments. The second line below the alignment indicates the HA domains: red for the fusion domain, yellow for the vestigial esterase domain, green for the receptor binding domain, and cyan for the ectodomain. Putative sialic acid binding pocket residues are shown with green circles. Cysteines responsible for disulfide bonds between HA1 and HA2 segments are shown with blue diamonds. C05 binding residues on A/Denver/57 HA are indicated with red down arrows. Previously identified antigenic sites are indicated by black dashes. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using Clustal Omega27; the graphical output was generated by ESpript (https://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/). (B) Structure of the IVA HA proteins coloured by sequence conservation, where red indicates 100% conservation and yellow indicates 35% sequence identity. Conservation was performed using PDB codes 6ML8, 6D8W, 6MYA, 6N41, 6ONA, 6OSR, and 7JPD in ConSurf server40.Full size imageStructural basis for the C05 interaction with the H1N1 influenza strain A/Denver/57Since there is no structure available of the C05 antibody bound to H1 (only H320,41,42), to better understand how H1N1 IVA HA strains interact with the C05 antibody, we solved the crystal structure of HA from IV A/Denver/1957 bound to the head binding antibody C05 Fab at 2.92 Å resolution (PDB ID: 6ML8). Our structure showed a similar mode of antibody binding to that determined previously for C05 bound to HA from IV A/Hong Kong/1/196820. PISA analysis of the HA:C05 complex revealed that seven HA residues mediate the interaction between the HA RBD antigenic motif and the C05 heavy chain, while only two HA residues mediate binding to the C05 light chain (Fig. 4A,B). Residues within the HA that mediate binding to the heavy chain include Tyr108, Thr144, Arg146, Val148, Ser158, Glu203, and Ser240, whilst HA residues interacting with the light chain include Arg18 and Thr20.Figure 4Analysis of the structure of HA from H1N1 influenza strain A/Denver/57 complexed with the antibody C05 Fab (PDB ID: 6ML8). (A) Structure of the HA: C05 complex. HA1 segment is in red; HA2 segment is in cyan; C05 heavy chain is in yellow; C05 light chain is in blue.

(B) List of interactions between HA1 (red) and the C05 heavy chain (yellow) and light chain (blue). (C) Sequence alignment of the interacting residues in all seven HAs, compared to the HA: C05 complex (PDB ID: 6ML8).Full size imageComparing the structure of A/Denver/57 HA in complex with C05 Fab to our six other HA structures showed differences in the C05 antibody binding site (Fig. 4C). The only residue conserved in all seven structures is Tyr108, which is also one of the conserved sialic acid binding pocket sites. Thr144 is not conserved in any other structures and mutated to either Asp in A/Jiangsu/ALS1/2011 (PDB ID: 6D8W), Ser in the A/Melbourne/1/1946 strain, and Asn in the other strains. Arg146 was conserved with either a Lys or Arg in all strains except A/Hickox/JY2/1940, where an Ile residue was present. Val148 and Ser158 were both highly conserved, with one exception being A/Jiangsu/ALS1/2011, where these residues were Thr and Asn, respectively. Glu203 were conserved with negatively charged Asp/Glu residues with the exception of A/Hickox/JY2/1940, that contained an Asn. Finally, for Ser240, the most notable amino acid change was in A/Almatu/32/1998, which harboured a Pro at this position.Insertion between 146R-G147 influences C05 antibody bindingThe antibody C05 Fab failed to bind many of our other IVA HAs, as examined by analytical size exclusion chromatography (see data below). Failure to bind correlated with an insertion in HA between 146R-G147 of the epitope, whereas sequences without an insertion bound the antibody. For example, both A/Denver/57 (PDB ID: 6ML8, sequence: WPNHTTR/G147; Supplementary Fig. 4) and A/Iowa/1943 (sequence: WPKHTTG/G; Supplementary Fig. 6; structure not determined) lack an insertion at this site and show clear evidence of HA:C05 Fab complex formation. Examination of the HA alone structures provides insight into how certain sequences may evade recognition by the C05 antibody. Firstly, two structures, PDB 6N41 and 7JPD, contained glycosylated Asn residues at the Thr144 site (Figs. 3A, 4C), which could potentially physically block C05 antibody binding, while presumably retaining sialic acid binding (e.g. A/Netherlands/002P1/1951, PDB ID: 6N41, sequence: WPKHNTTR; and A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947, PDB ID: 7JPD, sequence: WPKHNITR); Fig. 5A. Secondly, the insertion positions a bulky residue (arginine, lysine, or isoleucine) into the C05 binding pocket (e.g. A/Jiangsu/ALSI/2011, PDB ID: 6D8W, sequence: WPNHDTTR; A/Almaty/32/1998, PDB ID: 6MYA, sequence: WPNHNTLK; A/Hickox/JY2/1940, PDB ID: 6ONA, sequence: WPNHNINI; Supplementary Fig. 5; A/Melbourne/1/1946, PDB ID: 6OSR, sequence: WPKHSTTK; Supplementary Fig. 7) (Fig. 5B).Figure 5Structural analysis of the HA proteins from IVA H1N1 revealed two possible mechanisms for disruption at the C05 interface. (A) Potential mechanism 1 involved a glycosylation of Asn at NTTR of PDB 6N41 (see also Fig. 3A), and NITR of PDB 7JPD (see also Fig. 3A). (B) insertion of an amino acid between 146RG147 pushes a bulky residue side chain into the C05 binding interface. In both images, C05 heavy and light chain are coloured blue and yellow respectively, and 6ML8 HA is coloured magenta (note 6ML8 binds C05). In the left panel, 7JPD is coloured cyan (and does not bind C05 due to a glycosylation), and right panel, 6OSR, coloured orange is coloured orange, and has a loop insertion at the C05 interface.Full size imageDiscussionAntigenic drift, an evolutionary accumulation of amino acid substitutions in antigenic proteins determined by host adaptive immune systems43, is one of the key mechanisms used by viruses to avoid recognition by the host immune system. Antigenic drift can also increase viral attachment to its host receptor. For this to happen, viral surface proteins undergo high selective pressure during their evolution44. HA and NA are spike proteins found on the surface of IVA and IVB virions, with HAs the main target of the humoral immune system. In humans, there are two main categories of broadly neutralising antibodies (bnAbs) that target IV HAs, those that bind to either the head (specifically the RBD) or the stalk. Due to the high sequence conservation within the stalk, stalk-binding bnAbs such as FI6v3 and CR9114 can neutralise a wide range of IV HAs. Conversely, the neutralisation ability of head-binding bnAbs is much narrower due to the hypervariable sequence of the RBD14. C05 employs a unique approach, demonstrating a long complementarity-determining region (CDR) to bind the RBD, minimising contact with the hypervariable sequence20. This allows C05 to bind diverse HAs from H1, H2, H3 and H9 viruses45.In the present study, we characterised the sequence and structure of HA from the H1N1 influenza strain A/Denver/57 bound to the bnAb C05 Fab and compared it to six additional H1N1 IVA HAs. Our analysis of all seven HA structures revealed that they adopt similar conformations and retain conserved putative sialic acid binding site residues, as seen in previously described IV HA structures. While further experiments are necessary to confirm the sialic acid binding site in our structures, highly conserved binding site residues in the previously characterised structure of IV HA with sialic acid suggests a similar binding site in our structures12,34,46.The VE domain exists in all seven of our IVA HA structures, however its function in IVA and IVB is not well defined. In IVC, the similar 9-O-acetylesterase domain within HEF cleaves the sialic acid receptor on the host cell to release the virus and help viral budding, whereas NA is responsible for cell receptor cleavage in IVA and IVB47. Some studies show that the VE domain has antigenic properties, with several mouse (mAb) and human (hAb) antibodies, such as mAb H3v-47, mAb 1H5, mAb CR8071, mAb 100F4, mAb CR8071, hAb 46B8, and hAb 100F4, found to target this domain48,49,50,51,52. This suggests that the VE domain could be considered as a potential target for vaccine design, however the variability of this domain (as demonstrated in Fig. 3) may be an obstacle.Recently, the HA stalk has become an interesting target for vaccine and drug design due to its conserved sequence and structure16,34,53. Within all seven of our IVA HA structures, the stalk is highly conserved, with reports that the stalk sequence is highly conserved both between and within IVA, IVB, and IVC. This allows some of the stalk-binding antibodies to bind and neutralise a variety of influenza strains16. hAbs CR6261 and F10 were found to neutralise most IVA group 1 strains by binding to the HA stalk54,55. Further, hAbs FI6v3 and CR9114 were found to bind IVA and both IVA and IVB, respectively50,56. These stalk-binding antibodies act by preventing conformational changes of HA, consequently hindering membrane fusion50,54,55,56. This highlights the potential of the HA stalk in the development of universal influenza vaccines.C05 is a well-characterised human antibody that employs a long heavy chain CDR3 for binding to the RBD in the HA head. This method of binding minimises the area contacting the hypervariable residues in the RBD. Previous studies report that C05 binds H3 subtype HA through the antibody heavy chain, using a single long loop that allows it to decrease the contact area to ~ 550 Å2, considerably smaller than the usual antibody-antigen contact (~ 650 and ~ 740 buried surface area on HA by CH65 and 2D1 antibodies, respectively). C05 was claimed to bind H1 and H2 subtype HAs via a similar mechanism20. Interestingly, our structure of the H1N1 influenza strain A/Denver/57 HA bound to the bnAb C05 Fab indicates that both the heavy and light chains contribute to binding. Further, the surface area buried by the C05 heavy chain CDR is ~ 786 Å2, which is close to that of the 2D1 antibody. Our other IVA HA structures all contain an insertion near the C05 Fab CDR3 binding site that appears to prevent antibody binding, via either insertion of an Asn which becomes glycosylated to physically block C05 binding, or insertion of an Arg, Lys, or Ile into the C05 binding pocket. Interestingly, these insertions do not affect the identity or the positioning of the sialic acid binding residues, allowing these strains to bind the cell surface receptors while eliminating nearby potential antibody recognition sites. Moreover, this same loop-insertion position was identified in H3N2 HA domains that were responsible for loss of C05 binding20. A recent study assayed the capacity of C05 to bind diverse HA molecules (not examined here)45. Examination of those HA sequences revealed that insertions in the binding pocket could predict the ability of C05 to bind and recognise, underpinning the importance of this region in determining C05 specificity. Although the insertion of either a glycosylated residue observed in the electron density of our structures (A/Netherlands/002P1/1951 and A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947) or of a bulky side chain which partially changes the loop conformation (A/Jiangsu/ALSI/2011, A/Almaty/32/1998, A/Hickox/JY2/1940, and A/Melbourne/1/1946) appears consistent with the loss of C05 antibody Fab binding by analytical SEC, rigorous mutational analysis and quantitative binding experiments would be required to prove these are evasion mechanisms. It is possible, for example, that the glycosylation could be accommodated by movement of the positioning of the antibody as was the case for the S245N glycosylation site of H3N2 viral neuraminidases with IG01 antibodies (Ref PubMed ID 36543789).

The scientists believe it may also treat similar viruses such as the one that causes Covid-19. Prof. Tsumoru Shintake, who leads the Quantum Wave Microscopy Unit at OIST, first proposed the idea to use ethanol vapor to treat respiratory tract infections. He set out to test the approach with his colleague, Prof. Hiroki Ishikawa, leader of the Immune Signal Unit at OIST, and their team members. "Ethanol is an effective disinfectant for body surfaces, so we wanted to know whether ethanol could also be effective inside the body," said Dr. Miho Tamai, a scientist in Prof. Ishikawa's lab. Using a humidifier to produce ethanol vapor in a small container, they found that when mice infected with influenza A inhale the vapor for ten minutes, the virus is inactivated. The study is published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases. Influenza A viruses accumulate in a thin fluid layer covering lung cells that protect the surface of the airway. The scientists think that the ethanol vapor must increase ethanol concentrations in the fluid to 20% to successfully treat the infection. This concentration is not toxic to lung cells the scientists created in the lab to mimic human cells. At body temperature, 20% ethanol can not only inactivate the influenza A virus outside of the cells in one minute, but also stop the virus from replicating inside these cells. The concentration of ethanol provided is important. If the concentration does not reach the right level to inactivate viruses, it will not be useful. Influenza A is a virus that has an outer membrane, called an envelope. "Ethanol vapor may also inactivate other enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2," Prof. Ishikawa said, and so far, all viruses that have caused pandemics have been enveloped. "Once the next pandemic happens, maybe we can quickly apply the ethanol vapor inhalation therapy to prevent or cure the disease," he explained.

He explained that if designed carefully, an ethanol vapor inhalation method could possibly stop a pandemic in future. He and Prof. Ishikawa will continue to collaborate to optimize the therapy and to investigate its effects on other respiratory infectious diseases such as avian influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2. The researchers believe that ethanol vapor inhalation treatment has great potential as a versatile and cost-effective new therapy against various respiratory infectious diseases. But Prof. Ishikawa cautioned that people should not try using ethanol as a therapy on their own. That may lead to serious side-effects or explosion risks. The efficacy and safety of this new treatment on humans and other mammals should be carefully evaluated in the future."

Person-to-person transmission of avian flu is unlikely, but not impossible. By Laura Lopez Gonzalez Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Email this article Print this article Avian flu cases have spiked around the globe in recent weeks, devastating bird populations and making headlines. The spread of the illness, caused by the H5N1 virus, has resulted in 58 million bird deaths since last fall — driving up poultry and egg prices and raising public concerns about it spreading to other species. “People are worried that it’s circulating a ton in birds and, now, some in mammals,” explains UC San Francisco infectious disease fellow Natasha Spottiswoode, MD, PhD. “There’s a concern that it might spill over into humans, as previous influenzas have.” But how likely is it that bird flu spurs the next pandemic? We asked Spottiswoode and UCSF biochemist Joe DeRisi, who combines genetics, computer science and biochemistry to track viruses. What is bird flu? Spottiswoode: Bird flu is the common name for a particular strain of what we call highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI. It occurs in wild and domesticated birds across the world. Flu gets subdivided into influenza A — which includes bird flu — and influenza B, which is less of an issue. Influenza A is further named by the two proteins on its surface, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), but that’s just a fancy way of saying that this particular virus is called H5N1. The numbers in its name refer to its clade, or branch of the influenza A family. How does bird flu spread to humans? Spottiswoode: Bird flu can spread to humans if people come in contact with fluids or feces from infected birds and can cause flu-like symptoms. It’s treated with antiviral medication. There have been no documented cases of human-to-human transmission of H5N1. As of April 2023, only a single person had been potentially infected in the U.S., but this could have been a misdiagnosis because they had been culling birds. If someone is working with birds and getting their fluids on them, it’s possible that very sensitive tests could detect the simple presence of the virus — rather than the patient having a true infection. How can we prevent future epidemics of bird flu or other animal-borne viruses? Spottiswoode: There are several ways pandemics emerge, and one of them is by putting different animals and people close together. This includes wet markets and the pet trade, but it’s also becoming more common as wild places shrink. DeRisi: The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak was traced to animals sold in a wet market. There are significant U.S. regulations against wet markets for this reason, but they’re still allowed in other countries. Spottiswoode: The U.S. is one of the largest importers of wild animals through the exotic pet trade. There was a massive Mpox outbreak this year, which usually affects rodents but can – through close contact – spread to humans, leading to painful rashes, for example. The 2003 U.S. Mpox outbreak originated through the pet trade as breeders kept prairie dogs next to imported pouched rats carrying Mpox. Will bird flu be the next COVID-19? Spottiswoode: Bird flu is fairly unlikely to be the next pandemic. To become a pandemic, a virus has to be able to pass from person to person effectively — as COVID-19 does. This virus has not shown the propensity to do that yet. DeRisi: There have been thousands of outbreaks in birds and dozens in other animals, and the virus hasn’t spilled over into humans. That gives us some confidence that the biological barrier that the virus would have to cross between birds and us is high. That doesn’t mean it can’t be surpassed — we know it can — but it isn’t likely. There’s reason not to panic, but there’s also reason to be cautious. Spottiswoode: Pandemics are a bit like avalanches — they are both individually low probability, but extremely high consequence events. On a grand scale, with the number of viruses that circulate, there is a very large chance that one of them will become an avalanche. You can ski the same slope every year and nothing will happen. It becomes tempting to say, “I’ll go out today without safety equipment.” Then, one day, everything just comes down on you. We really should be working on our safety systems to prevent them or stop them in their tracks.

Credit: John Eicher. All Rights Reserved.ExpandApril 26, 2023By Celeste ChoiALTOONA, Pa. — John Eicher, assistant professor of modern European history at Penn State Altoona, was recently awarded a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities for his work researching the 1918 influenza pandemic in Europe, historically known as the "Spanish flu." The fellowship is a multi-stage, highly selective process that supports scholars in the humanities via funding and support. According to the NEH website, fellowships are "competitive awards granted to individual scholars pursuing projects that embody exceptional research, rigorous analysis and clear writing. Applications must clearly articulate a project’s value to humanities scholars, general audiences, or both. Eicher was one of 70 recipients chosen from a pool of over 1,000 applicants for the 2023-24 academic year. In addition, two other Penn State faculty members also received fellowships. Eicher said he plans to use the funding to continue his current research project: “The Sword Outside, the Plague Within: The 1918 Influenza Pandemic in Europe.” Using more than 1,000 flu survivors' stories from 10 different European countries, the study compares how Europeans understood and interpreted the origin and spread of the pandemic and how they situated the incident within the context of WWI. According to Eicher, “This fellowship will let me take the work I’ve been doing with my student researchers and put it to paper as a book.” Eicher’s research did not originally begin with the 1918 pandemic in Europe, he said. His research process began in 2018 when he visited Berlin, Germany, intending to work on a book project on German immigration to Texas in the 1840s. However, upon reading archives about immigrants, Eicher said he faced a problem: He could not read old German script. “I was pretty demoralized when faced with this immediate and difficult limitation,” Eicher shared. Given this barrier, continuing his research on that topic seemed impossible, he added — but he did not stop there. When Eicher returned home from the archive, an advertisement for a game called “Plague Inc.” caught his eye. It just so happened that it was the centennial of the 1918 influenza pandemic, and something clicked, he said. The realization sparked a new point of interest for Eicher and brought him back to the archive the next day, where he discovered two large volumes of primary documents, collected by the German government, that had been practically overlooked in the last 15 years, with only three people having checked them out in all that time. Eicher said he saw this as an opportunity to redirect his research toward an unexplored topic. “This fellowship will let me take the work I’ve been doing with my student researchers and put it to paper as a book.”John Eicher, assistant professor of modern European history at Penn State AltoonaFast forward to 2019. Eicher heard that there was a large collection of primary documents about the flu in London and decided to take a visit. There, he found 2,700 documents consisting of interview transcripts and personal letters from flu survivors in nearly 20 countries. Only a few historians had used certain letters previously, but never the full collection. “It was a treasure trove,” Eicher said. Eicher photographed these memory documents, and through the efforts of student workers at Penn State Altoona and the University of Freiburg, he entered them into a searchable database. The student researchers assisted Eicher with “tagging” the memories, which lets him filter different types of letters according to their authors’ characteristics and condition during their illnesses. Working together, they created over 300 single-spaced pages of tags. Then, in 2020-21, Eicher held a yearlong fellowship at the University of Freiburg, where he had the opportunity to work as a Marie Curie Junior Fellow and visited roughly 15 physical archives in Switzerland, Germany and France. This research allowed me to take a ‘snapshot’ of responses to the flu in three neighboring countries," said Eicher. "The great thing about the region is that France was one of the Allies in WWI, Germany was a central power and Switzerland was neutral, which adds a level of complexity to the analysis.” In the summer of 2023, Eicher will be returning to Europe, where he will be a Simona Veil Fellow at the University of Munich. With the support of Penn State Global, he will visit Hanover to give a lecture on his research. For more information on Eicher’s work, visit his website.

Faculty Alumni Giving Home / News / Research and Innovation / Research and Innovation Flu Vaccination Improved Surgical Outcomes for COVID Patients By: Josh Baxt | April 28, 2023 | 3 min. read | Share Researchers at UHealth – University of Miami Health System and the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine have found that influenza vaccinations reduced surgical complications for patients with COVID-19. This large, retrospective study showed flu shots reduced the risks of sepsis, infections, deep vein thrombosis (blood clots), heart attacks and other issues. The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE. A study found that flu shots reduced surgical complications for patients with COVID-19. “SARS-CoV-2-positive surgical patients who received the influenza vaccine, between six months and two weeks before being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, experienced significantly decreased risks of sepsis, acute myocardial infarction, surgical site infections and death,” said Devinder Singh, M.D., chief and program director of the Division of Plastic Surgery, professor of clinical surgery and senior author on the study. “This highlights the flu vaccine’s potential protective effects against SARS-CoV-2.” These results are part of a growing body of evidence showing that flu vaccinations can improve medical and surgical outcomes for patients with COVID-19. In 2021, the research team published a retrospective study that showed flu vaccinations decreased the risk of sepsis and stroke up to 120 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Intrigued, the team posed the same question for surgical patients. Devinder Singh, M.D. In the study, the investigators examined de-identified medical records from more than 43,000 patients who underwent surgery between January 2020 and January 2021. The active cohort received an influenza vaccine between two weeks and six months before surgery, while patients in the control group were not vaccinated. The team assessed post-operative complications 30, 60, 90 and 120 days after surgery. The researchers also determined how many surgery patients with COVID would need vaccination to prevent any single complication within 120 days of their procedure. They found 223 vaccinated patients would prevent one sepsis; 250 would prevent an acute heart attack and 883 would prevent a death. Further Research Will Identify Benefits Mechanisms While the researchers did not examine the mechanisms by which flu vaccination protects COVID-positive patients from surgical complications, they believe the vaccine stimulates both innate and adaptive immune responses, which may slow viral replication. They expect continuing research to ultimately identify the precise mechanisms associated with these benefits. The authors note this is a retrospective study and should be validated prospectively. However, given the known safety and potential protective impacts of flu vaccinations on COVID-positive surgical patients, they recommend that surgeons and patients discuss this option before a procedure. These findings could also support better care in regions that lack easy access to COVID vaccines or for patients who are resistant to novel vaccines. “Influenza vaccination is a more well-accepted and accessible option for the global community,” said Susan Taghioff, M.D., first author on the study. “Its low cost and predictable side effects make it a valuable option for patients who lack access to COVID-19 vaccines and may also benefit people who are at high-risk for surgical mortality.” Tags: COVID-19, Dr. Devinder Singh, Dr. Susan Taghioff, flu vaccine, UHealth - University of Miami Health System Related Significant Published Analysis Supports New “MRD” Endpoint for Multiple Myeloma May 21, 2024 | 6 min. read Miller School Researchers Create Tool to Measure Susceptibility to Financial Scams March 06, 2024 | 4 min. read DSUI Researchers Present Record Number of Abstracts at SMSNA Meeting December 21, 2023 | 4 min. read Categories Clinical Care Community Outreach Grants and Awards Medical Education Research and Innovation Topics Alumni Cancer Cardiovascular Medicine Digestive Health and Liver Diseases Diversity Infectious Diseases Neurosciences Ophthalmology Orthopaedics Otolaryngology Philanthropy Urology FacebookYouTubeTwitterLinkedInInstagramResearch Gate Resources News Research MyUM UM Network Alumni Association Giving Wellness Center Careers University of Miami Visit Campus Highlights Transportation & Parking UHealth Bascom Palmer Eye Institute Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center Emergency Information | Privacy Statement & Legal Notices © 2024 University of Miami.

By TZVI JOFFRE APRIL 27, 2023 12:17 Updated: APRIL 28, 2023 07:34 The domestic ferret (photo credit: Wikimedia Commons) A strain of the H5N1 subtype of avian influenza has been found to effectively transmit between ferrets, causing deadly illness in the mammals, according to a new pre-print study by Canadian researchers.The study has not yet been peer-reviewed but has been submitted to the Nature Portfolio journal for review.In the past two years, large outbreaks of the H5N1 subtype have spread across Europe and the Americas, with additional outbreaks reported across the world. In recent months, increasing numbers of mammals have been found to be infected with the virus, with mass die-offs of seals and sea lions reported in Russia and the Americas and dozens of foxes, skunks, dolphins, raccoons and cats found to be infected as well. The researchers noted that last spring, they started to observe reassortments of the 2.3.4.4b clade of the H5N1 subtype with North American influenza A viruses in samples collected from domestic and wild birds, as well as mammals.The researchers isolated five distinct H5N1 viruses from infected wild animals in Canada, three from birds and two from red foxes. Some of the samples included a mutation that is known to increase virulence in mammals. Workers in protective gear seen in Moshav Givat Yoav, in northern Israel, December 29, 2021, following an outbreak of avian influenza (credit: MICHAEL GILADI/FLASH90)One of the samples, taken from a red-tailed hawk, resulted in lethal disease and efficient transmission in ferrets, with some evidence of airborne transmission between the ferrets.The researchers noted that these results show that H5N1 viruses could acquire adaptions through sustained transmission in mammals to spread more effectively in mammals, including humans. Ferrets are seen as an important animal model for analyzing how viruses could affect humans as they can be infected by human influenza viruses and exhibit similar symptoms to humans.First time H5N1 has been shown to transmit between ferretsIn past studies, H5N1 has usually not been transmitted efficiently between ferrets, although it has been shown to sometimes cause lethal illness. In the new study, the researchers infected the ferrets with the five virus samples, with only one of the ferrets surviving after infection.Some of the most severe illness was seen in the ferrets infected with the sample from the red-tailed hawk and ferrets placed in the cages with those infected with the strain showed signs of direct transmission and severe illness, requiring euthanasia within 8-12 days after coming into contact with the originally infected ferrets. Another one of the ferrets that came into contact with a ferret infected with a sample from a red fox also showed signs of possible transmission, but it did not have an infectious virus in any tissues examined. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now The researchers conducted a follow-up experiment to further examine the transmission potential of the red-tailed hawk sample in ferrets, including indirect transmission by aerosols or droplets. Four ferrets were infected with the sample and then an additional, noninfected ferret was added to each ferret's cage and a noninfected ferret was placed downwind from the directional airflow of the cage system a day later. The ferret placed downwind of each ferret was separated from the other two ferrets in the trio by a double steel mesh screen, preventing direct contact but allowing airflow.The infected ferrets quickly developed severe symptoms, requiring euthanasia within five days of infection. Despite the quick progression of the virus, three of the four ferrets placed in the cages of the four infected ferrets were also infected. None of the four ferrets placed downwind of the other ferrets developed symptoms, but one of the ferrets did test positive on a nasal swab. The researchers ended the experiment after eight days in order to allow the collection of tissue samples at a set time point.Further research needed on possible airborne transmissionIn all four of the downwind ferrets, viral RNA was found in nasal and lung tissue samples, with the researchers stating that this showed that the animals were likely infected during the experiment, but the study was ended before significant viral replication occurred. The researchers added that this shows that additional experiments to assess the potential for airborne transmission are a priority. The researchers stressed that while there has not as of yet been evidence of sustained transmission between mammals in the wild, the results of the study may show the potential of H5N1 to cause mammalian outbreaks. The researchers pointed to a recent H5N1 outbreak in farmed minks in Spain.The researchers additionally noted that the virus sample isolated from the red-tailed hawk contained signs of adaptation to mammals, suggesting that the hawk may have been infected by eating mammalian carrion. Its passage through multiple species may have contributed to its enhanced transmissibility in ferrets as well."Our research has determined that certain, as yet uncharacterized, genetic signatures may be important determinants of mammalian adaptation and pathogenicity of these viruses," wrote the researchers in the study. "Ongoing surveillance of circulating HPAI A(H5N1) viruses across species, including humans, should be a top priority so as to promptly identify viruses that may have pandemic or outbreak potential in mammals."'Largest-ever' outbreak of bird flu continues across Europe, AmericasThe new study comes amid an ongoing outbreak of avian influenza in North and South America and Europe which began in 2021 and has been described as "the largest-ever" outbreak on both continents.The outbreak has been widely affecting both birds and mammals. In the US alone, over 58 million poultry have been affected and 6,715 infected wild birds have been found in almost every state. In Europe, thousands of wild and domestic birds were found to be infected in over 24 countries, with many sea birds affected.The virus has been reported in Israel as well, with the last case reported in a seagull on April 9 at Habonim, north of Zichron Ya'akov, over two months after the last recorded case, according to the Agriculture Ministry. Additional cases of the H5N1 strain were reported in January, December and November in various locations throughout Israel. The first outbreak of the season was reported at a turkey slaughterhouse in Kibbutz Shluhot in northern Israel in November.A number of human cases have been reported among the outbreaks around the world as well, with the most recent H5N1 case in humans reported in Chile. Earlier this month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that two mutations associated with adaption to mammals were found in the PB2 gene of the virus in a sample collected from a patient in Chile. The mutations have been previously detected in samples of the H7N9 subtype of avian influenza. The CDC added that these mutations are not typical of other samples of the virus circulating in birds in Chile, "strongly suggesting" that the mutations were acquired in the patient during the course of the illness.The CDC stressed that the overall risk to human health from H5 avian influenza outbreaks remains low. In a risk assessment published on April 24, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the likelihood of sustained human-to-human transmission of avian influenza remains low, although sporadic human infections in places where the virus is spreading among animals are possible.Earlier this week, Nicola Lewis, director of the World Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, noted to The BMJ that viruses such as H5N1 could "mutate into something that then has the capability to infect an even wider host range or potentially to start to manage to sustain transmission in the mammalian host.""I certainly think, I’m afraid to say, that future pandemics are likely inevitable," added Lewis. “I’m very concerned that we are missing the opportunity. We cannot not take this opportunity to learn what we can from the covid pandemic to make sure that we are better prepared next time. Because there will be a next time.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags Canada scientific study Virus research bird flu Hot Opinion Dear Jared Kushner, the Jewish people need you By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

Coping strategies that can help / Diseases & Conditions 10 things parents should know about flu shots April 28, 2023 By Claire McCarthy, MD, Senior Faculty Editor, Harvard Health Publishing Every year, influenza sickens millions, hospitalizes hundreds of thousands, and kills tens of thousands. This is not your average common cold. While it is especially dangerous for anyone who already has a health problem (such as a weakened immune system, or heart or lung problems), it can be dangerous for healthy people, too. Even if you don't get that sick from the flu, aside from missing school or work there is the very real problem that influenza is very contagious — and you can be contagious before you realize that you have the flu. That means you can spread it to others, some of whom may get very sick. Getting immunized helps keep everyone safe: it's not just about you, it's about everyone around you. This is especially true for children, who aren't always great about washing their hands and tend to touch lots of things and people around them. Here are a few things all parents should know about the flu vaccine: It's the best way to prevent the flu. Hand washing is crucial, and staying away from sick people helps, but we can't wash our hands every second, and we can't always know who is sick. It's true that the vaccine isn't 100% effective (the effectiveness varies by year) but it's your best bet if you don't want to get sick. You and your children should get it early. The flu season runs from roughly September to March. The sooner you get it, the sooner you are protected. It's best to get it done before the end of October. This is especially true if your child is young and hasn't had it before, because… Children who are less than nine years old and getting it for the first time need two doses, a month apart. So getting started early is even more important for them. People with egg allergy can get the flu shot. If the allergy is severe you should talk to your doctor, as in those cases it's recommended that people be monitored and have medications to treat an allergic reaction at the ready, but it's unlikely that that anything will happen. There are very few people who shouldn't get a flu shot. Children less than six months old or who had a definite allergic reaction to the flu shot are the only ones who can't. Those with a history of Guillain-Barre Syndrome should talk to their doctor, but that's rare. If a child is significantly ill we will sometimes postpone the shot, but children with a minor illness like a cold can get it. There are some people who really need a flu shot. That includes babies who are at higher risk of complications, as well as children with asthma, other lung diseases, heart problems, weakened immune systems, or other chronic illnesses. You should call your doctor right away about getting vaccinated if your child falls into one of these groups. Healthy children 2 years and older may be offered the nasal spray flu vaccine. Because the vaccine uses a live attenuated virus, some children are not good candidates for the nasal spray version. You don't need to worry about thimerosal. Thimerosal is a preservative that has been used to prevent contamination in vaccines. Some people have worried that it could be linked to autism, but it has been studied carefully and there is no actual evidence that this is true. There is no thimerosal in the vaccines we routinely give to children. There are some formulations of the flu vaccine that contain a tiny amount of thimerosal, but there are also preservative-free formulations available. Either way, your child is safe. Talk to your doctor if you have questions about this. You can't catch the flu from the flu shot. The virus in the injected flu vaccine is inactivated. As with any vaccine, there can be side effects; the most common ones are pain at the injection site or fever. But it cannot give you the flu. Many older children can get the flu shot at their local pharmacy. We pediatricians like you to get shots at our office, so that we have a record of it and can answer any questions. But we mostly want your child to be vaccinated, and we understand that getting to the office isn't always easy. If your child does get the flu shot at a pharmacy or flu clinic, please bring documentation to your doctor so that they can put it in their medical record. If you have any questions about the flu or the flu shot, check out flu.gov.

How can we pin it down? Holge Hannemann | 04/24/2023 | 6 min read Influenza viruses A and B are a major public health concern, mainly affecting the pharynx, trachea, and sometimes the lungs of millions of people worldwide each year, with symptoms that range from mild to life-threatening. Alongside seasonal outbreaks (which tend to prevail over the winter months) there is also the looming threat of pandemic influenza strains, which have the potential to bring healthcare systems to a standstill because most people have little or no immunity. The most effective preventative measure against flu is vaccination. Here, I’ll explore the challenges associated with flu vaccine development – and the emerging technologies hoping to tackle them.The current vaccine landscape Most influenza vaccines elicit antibodies against the major viral surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). This poses a challenge for vaccine formulation because evolutionary changes in these proteins enable the virus to evade the adaptive immune response through a combination of phenomena known as antigenic drift and shift (1), as shown in Figure 1. Antigenic drift occurs when influenza viruses continuously undergo changes to their HA and NA surface proteins through mutation. These changes accumulate over time, transforming the viruses and allowing them to escape host recognition without hindering their ability to gain entry to cells. Antigen shift, on the other hand, is much rarer and is defined by abrupt changes to HA and NA through genome reassortment by influenza A with other influenza subtypes that are co-infecting the same host cell, made possible by the segmented nature of the influenza virus genome. These drastic changes allow influenza viruses to catch our immune systems completely off-guard and rapidly spread through populations, leading to pandemics. The 1918 Spanish Flu and 1968/1969 flu pandemic are two notable historical examples of this. As a result, vaccine formulations must be regularly updated to keep up with emerging forms of the flu viruses. Figure 1. Antigenic drift is the gradual accumulation of smaller mutations, whereas antigenic shift is a sudden, drastic change.Standard flu vaccines are formed from inactivated and live-attenuated viruses produced using chicken eggs – every year, vaccine producers consume millions of eggs in this process. Although this is the current leading strategy, it is a highly complex and time-consuming process, typically taking 6–8 months to produce sufficient quantities. Because of the long timescales involved, the WHO meets twice yearly to predict and select the vaccine components for the upcoming influenza seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. These predictions inform the entire vaccine development chain – from the reagents used for research and development through to selecting formulations and manufacturing the vaccines themselves. Unfortunately, despite these efforts, vaccine efficacy is usually under 60 percent – and can even drop as low as 10 percent (2). Uncertainties in strain prediction can result in vaccines that significantly differ from the strain circulating for that season (3).Because vaccines play such a vital role in preventing serious flu outbreaks, the challenges in their development and production pose a real threat to human health. This risk is exacerbated during pandemics, as we saw in the devastating 2009 Swine Flu outbreak – during which a delayed vaccine roll-out is thought to have caused thousands of additional deaths (4). Consequently, there has been a significant push within the industry for more sustainable and effective alternatives.One avenue currently being explored is a universal flu vaccine. A successful universal vaccine would ideally eliminate the need for seasonal re-formulation by providing robust, long-lasting protection against multiple subtypes of flu and emerging strains, as opposed to just a select few. A popular target for universal vaccines is HA’s stalk domain, which plays a fundamental role in membrane fusion. Unlike the head of the HA protein, the stalk typically remains unchanged and the elicited antibodies tend to ward off a variety of other strains (5). A number of candidates are in development, with various approaches being taken. Figure 2. Traditional seasonal flu vaccines target the “head” of the HA protein, whereas universal vaccines trigger antibodies (partially shown in gray) that bind to the stalk (light blue) (7).All eyes ahead, all eyes on the ball… Although they are now famous thanks to the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, mRNA vaccines had been in development as alternatives to live attenuated/inactivated virusecombinant protein vaccines for a while before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic hit. The technology works by delivering mRNA to cells that subsequently express HA proteins, which the body can then produce antibodies against.We have seen how successful the platform can be, allowing researchers to quickly swap mRNA encoding for different antigens. This technology holds great promise for influenza because it provides a means to rapidly change the vaccine target without repeated approval procedures, and thus use highly modular technology and manufacturing to hedge bets against and rapidly respond to emerging and potential pandemic strains. Other benefits of mRNA vaccines include a shorter manufacturing period than traditional egg-based methods, and greater potential efficacy. Combining this technology with universal vaccine approaches could be key to overcoming the challenges of season flu and erasing the threat of pandemics.A team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania is using mRNA technology to test a universal vaccine that contains HA proteins from 20 different flu lineages (6). Studies in mice and ferrets have shown promising results in reducing signs of illness and protecting against death, even when exposed to strains not included in the vaccine.Though these new technologies present exciting developments and possibilities for the future, it is also important to focus on improving existing vaccines and create solutions that can be immediately implemented. Next-generation adjuvants could provide answers by enhancing and modulating the immune response. Adjuvants are substances that boost immune response through various mechanisms – including the creation of antigen depots, the activation of the innate immune response, the recruitment of immune cells, and improvements in antigen uptake. Currently there are only six licensed adjuvants available in combination with flu vaccine: Alum, MF59, AS03, AF03, virosomes, and heat labile enterotoxin. Thus, there is much space yet to explore. The discovery and design of novel adjuvants could be particularly helpful for inducing robust antibody responses in high-risk populations, such as the elderly or those with pre-existing conditions.Ultimately, emerging technologies offer a great deal of promise in tackling flu – and the COVID-19 pandemic has already demonstrated our ability to rapidly deploy some of these with real success. To continue along this trajectory, reagent companies, like my own, must continue to support vaccine developers and manufacturers by providing the very latest high-quality products to facilitate efficient R&D. We do this by regularly updating our supplies according to the latest WHO predictions, ensuring researchers have access to relevant recombinant proteins as quickly as possible. Such cooperation and communication will enable mankind to continue to strengthen existing and new approaches for flu vaccine development. Through improved strain prediction and disease surveillance, we will be able to build a comprehensive defense against the moving target that is influenza.

Although the structure of polymerase is well understood, our knowledge of its regulation by phosphorylation is still incomplete. The heterotrimeric polymerase can be regulated by posttranslational modifications, but the endogenously occurring phosphorylations at the PA and PB2 subunits of the IAV polymerase have not been studied. Mutation of phosphosites in PB2 and PA subunits revealed that PA mutants resembling constitutive phosphorylation have a partial (S395) or complete (Y393) defect in the ability to synthesize mRNA and cRNA. As PA phosphorylation at Y393 prevents binding of the 5′ promoter of the genomic RNA, recombinant viruses harboring such a mutation could not be rescued. These data show the functional relevance of PA phosphorylations to control the activity of viral polymerase during the influenza infectious cycle.

Variants of circulating or newly emerging IAVs continue to annually trigger global health threats for both humans and animals and occasionally pandemic outbreaks1. IAVs are the most pathogenic subtypes for humans, causing seasonal epidemics and occasionally pandemics2. Due to their high genomic plasticity and continuous evolution, they are able to escape host immunity and adapt to new host species1,3. IAVs possess an RNA genome of 8 segments that encodes up to 17 proteins4. IAVs enter cells by endocytosis and after uncoating the viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) is trafficked to the nucleus5. The vRNP is composed of the virion RNA (vRNA) in association with the nucleocapsid protein (NP) and a heterotrimeric RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex (composed of PB1, PB2 and PA)6. In a pioneering round of transcription, the viral polymerase interacts with host cell RNA polymerase II to allow cap binding of nascent cellular mRNA by PB2 and PA-mediated mRNA cleavage close to the capped 5′ end. The capped RNA cleavage product is then used as a primer for polymerase-mediated generation of viral mRNAs encoding viral proteins7. After the production of mRNAs and viral proteins at the beginning of the infection cycle, the polymerase preferentially uses primer-independent replication at later time points, to generate complement copies of vRNA (cRNA) that is stabilized by the binding of freshly synthesized NP protein8. The cRNA-containing RNP complexes (cRNPs) then serve as templates for the synthesis of progeny vRNA, which is mediated by newly synthesized viral polymerase dimerizing with cRNP-bound polymerases9,10. Both ends of the vRNAs or cRNAs remain partially paired and act as promoters during RNA synthesis11,12. The 5′ end of the RNA folds into a stem loop structure that is bound in a pocket formed by PB1 and PA13,14,15.The temporally offset association of influenza polymerase with vRNA or alternatively with cRNA requires a high degree of regulation. This plasticity is achieved by several mechanisms, which include the adoption of alternative configurations depending on the association with vRNA or cRNA16. Subunits of the polymerase complex also interact with numerous host cell proteins where for example association of the polymerase with the S5-phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II is required for generation of viral mRNAs17,18. Further examples for regulatory proteins affecting polymerase function are regulatory interactions with p21, sphingosine kinase 1, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator and Ran-Binding Protein 519,20,21,22. In addition, the three subunits of the viral polymerase are modified by numerous posttranslational modifications including acetylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitination, Neddylation and phosphorylation23,24,25,26,27,28,29. The temporally and spatially restricted occurrence of protein modifications such as phosphorylation allow the dynamic and reversible control of many properties that include enzymatic activities and intermolecular interactions.Here we set out to investigate the functional consequences of phosphorylations occurring at the PB2 and PA subunits of IAV polymerase, which have not yet been investigated. Amino acid changes, which mimic constitutive phosphorylation at PA S395 resulted in a partial limitation of the ability to synthesize mRNA and cRNA. PA phosphorylation at Y393 prevented binding of the 5′-ends of vRNA and cRNA and largely inactivated the polymerase function. These data show the functional relevance of regulated PA phosphorylations during the influenza virus infectious cycle.ResultsDynamic regulation of IAV polymerase is also mediated by regulatory phosphorylations that were characterized for the PB1 catalytic subunit30. We set out to investigate the possible function of evolutionarily conserved phosphorylation sites located in regions of functional relevance. Interestingly, most of the documented phosphorylation sites of the polymerase subunits are highly conserved between human and non-human IAVs (Fig. 1A). Some of these phosphorylation sites are located in relevant domains including PB2 T471, which is located within the Cap-binding domain (amino acids 319–481)31. Two further interesting sites are PA Y393 and S395, which are contained in the so-called PA arch domain, a region contributing to the interaction with PB1 and close to the 5′ vRNA/cRNA binding pocket13,14,15. The positions of these phospho-sites within the IAV polymerase complex are displayed in Fig. 1B. These phosphorylations have been discovered by phosphoproteomic analysis of cells infected with SC35 (derived from A/Seal/Massachussetts/1/80 (H7N7)) and also its mouse-adapted variant SC35M32. To confirm the occurrence of these PA phosphorylations by an independent experimental approach, 293T cells were transfected to express all components of a vRNP including the PA wild type (WT) protein or a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (PA YS 393,395 FA). This mutant showed reduced PA phosphorylation, as detected by Phos-tag™ SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). To further investigate the potential functional relevance of these phosphorylation sites, we also created phospho-mimetic (S/T/Y to E) mutants. The resulting mutants either lack the occurrence of phosphorylation (phosphorylation-deficient) or the dynamic alternation between the unmodified and the phosphorylated state (phospho-mimetic). These mutated SC35M viruses were produced using a reverse genetics system, as visualized in suppl. Fig. S1. After co-transfection of eight plasmids encoding the viral RNAs and proteins in a co-culture of 293T/MDCK II cells, the resulting virions were amplified on MDCK II cells and the titers were determined. In these experiments, we repeatedly failed in several attempts to generate viruses bearing a phospho-mimetic mutation at PA Y393, either alone or in combination with a further mutation at PA S395 (Fig. 2B, suppl. Table S1). These results suggest that permanent and unregulated phosphorylation at this site prohibits the generation of virus progeny. To characterize the mutations further, all rescued viruses with mutations in the polymerase subunits were investigated for their replication in mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-15), which are widely used to study SC35M infection33,34. A comparative analysis of mutant viruses in multi-cycle replication assays showed roughly similar replication kinetics at 12, 24, and 36 h.p.i. in MLE-15 for all mutant viruses with the exception of the PA S395E mutant, which showed a significantly reduced replication capacity in the early phases of infection (Fig. 2C).Figure 1Summary of IAV phosphorylation sites in the polymerase subunits.

The remaining material was used for immunoprecipitation and treatment with λ phosphatase as a control, followed by Phos-tag™ SDS-PAGE and detection of PA phosphorylation, as revealed by occurrence of upshifted bands which are indicated by arrows. The position and size (kDa) of molecular weight markers are shown. (B) Summary of the rescue of recombinant viruses encoding the indicated WT and mutant proteins, a + indicates successful rescue. (C) MLE-15 cells were infected with the indicated viruses at a MOI of 0.001 and viral growth was monitored 12, 24, and 36 h.p.i. by focus forming assays. Focus forming units (FFU) are shown, the dashed line represents the peak of WT SC35M titers. Error bars represent SDs from three independent experiments. All P values show significance in comparison to the WT control at each time point using one-way ANOVA (*P ≤ 0.05 and **P ≤ 0.01).Full size imageTo test whether the modifications occurring at the polymerase subunits PB2 and PA affect activity of viral polymerase, minigenome replication assays using a luciferase reporter gene were performed. In this system, a set of bidirectional plasmids co-expressing a vRNA-like transcript and a corresponding mRNA, both encoding the SC35M PB1, PB2, PA or NP proteins were co-expressed with a reporter gene. The reporter plasmid directs the production of a negative-sense vRNA-like transcript, which can be converted from the vRNP to a luciferase encoding mRNA, thus providing a quantitative read-out for RdRp activity, as schematically shown in Fig. 3A. To determine the impact of the selected PA and PB2 phosphorylation sites on RdRp polymerase activity, 293T cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid along with four plasmids encoding NP and the WT polymerase proteins or their phospho-mimetic or phospho-deficient PB2 and PA mutants. Quantification of the luciferase activity did not reveal any significant contribution of PB2 T471 phosphorylation for polymerase function, while the phospho-mimetic mutations of PA S395 led to a significant reduction in RdRp activity. Even less activity was found for the PA Y393E mutant, while mutation of both sites resulted in loss of RdRp polymerase activity (Fig. 3A). As the selected PA phosphorylation sites are relevant for RdRp-mediated transcription, they were further analyzed using an alternative mini-genome reporter system35. This experimental setup differs from the aforementioned system in that the viral proteins are expressed only from mRNA without the corresponding vRNA (see Fig. 3B). Also these experiments confirmed the impaired transcriptional activity of the PA Y393E and S395E mutants. Together, these experiments suggest that constitutive phosphorylation at Y393 and/or S395 impairs polymerase-mediated mRNA production, but do not allow any conclusions on the production of cRNA.Figure 3PA phosphorylation impairs RdRp activity. (A) The lower part shows the experimental set-up for the minigenome assay co-expressing the v/mRNAs of the viral PB2, PB1, PA and NP proteins. 293T cells were transfected to express the a Pol1-promoter driven vRNA-like transcript encoding the reporter gene together with pHW2000 plasmids allowing the expression of v- and mRNAs encoding the indicated viral proteins. One day later, cells were harvested and activities from Firefly luciferase (generated by vRNP polymerase activity using negative sense vRNA as a template) and Renilla luciferase (generated by a constitutive RNA polymerase II promoter and used for normalization) were determined. Activity by the WT vRNP was set to 100%, error bars represent SDs from three independent experiments. (B) The experiment was done as in (A) with the difference that the viral proteins were expressed from pCAGGS plasmids, not generating vRNAs, as schematically shown in the lower part. Extracts were used for determination of luciferase activity, the numbers show relative activity compared to the WT polymerase. (C) 293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS vectors directing the synthesis of the four proteins forming the vRNP together with the pPOLI-CAT-RT reporter plasmid, which generates a virus-like RNA as a first template. After isolation of RNA, the levels of cRNA, mRNA, rRNA (loading control) and the input vRNA (derived from a constitutive RNA polymerase I promoter) were determined by extension of 32P-unlabeled primers, gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. (D) Data from three independent experiments performed in (C) were quantified and normalized to the 5S rRNA control. The RNA levels determined in cells expressing the WT vRNP were set to 100%. In all experiments, P values ≤ 0.001 are indicated by ***.Full size imageTo address this question, primer extension experiments were performed, which correspond to the experimental scheme shown in Fig. 3B with the exception that a pPOLI-CAT-RT reporter plasmid was used35. This reporter is transcribed by RNA Polymerase I to generate a vRNA-like transcript that can be converted by the co-expressed viral polymerase to yield cRNA and mRNA, respectively36,37. Cells were transfected as shown, followed by isolation of RNA and detection of the different RNA species by extension of specific radiolabeled primers. Gel electrophoresis and autoradiography allowed to detect similar levels of RNA polymerase I-derived vRNA as a template as expected, but strong differences in the production of mRNA and cRNA (Fig. 3C). No mRNA and cRNA was produced by polymerases with a PA Y393E mutation, while the PA S395E mutant showed residual generation of mRNA and cRNA. Together, these results and their quantitative evaluation (Fig. 3D) suggest that the inability to rescue recombinant SC35M viruses expressing the PA Y393E or the PA YS 393, 395 EE mutants is attributable to a defective polymerase function.What molecular mechanism can explain the lack of functionality of the Y393-modified PA subunit? Y393 and also the neighboring S395 are part of the PA arch, an extended loop through which a ß-hairpin region of the PB1 protein inserts14. To investigate whether the mutant PA Y393E protein shows any changes in its ability to interact with PB1, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. The PA Y393 phosphorylation status had no consistent and statistically significant effect on its ability to interact with PB1, regardless whether both proteins were expressed alone, together with PB2 (suppl. Fig. S2A) or even in the presence of all components of the RNP including vRNA (suppl. Fig. S2B). Similarly, PA phosphorylation had no discernable effects on the intracellular localization of PA (suppl. Fig. S3). The PA sheet and the inserted PB1-ß hairpin together form an integral part of the binding site for the 5′ ends of vRNA and cRNA containing a stem-loop structure38,39, as visualized for the PA/RNA interaction in Fig. 4A. To determine the effects of PA phosphorylation on its ability to bind RNA, we measured the interaction between the purified polymerase complex and the 5′ ends of vRNA and cRNA. These in vitro experiments followed established protocols where the polymerase complex is purified by tandem affinity purification (TAP)40,41. Fusion of the TAP-Tag to the C-terminus of SC35M PB2 unexpectedly precluded its expression upon co-expression of further members of the polymerase (suppl. Fig. S4) for unknown reasons. We therefore mutated the evolutionary conserved Y393 and S395 sites in the PA protein from the A/WSN/33 (H1N1 WSN) strain and expressed the affinity-tagged PB2 protein along with the WSN PB1 and PA and its mutants in HEK 293T cells. The polymerase complex was isolated by affinity purification and further characterized by silver staining and immunoblotting (Fig. 4B). Equal amounts of purified polymerase complexes were incubated with 32P-labeled 5′ vRNA and cRNA promoter in the presence of the corresponding unlabeled 3′ RNA promoters, followed by UV irradiation for covalent linkage of RNA/protein complexes. After SDS-PAGE the amount of 5′-RNA-bound RdRp was measured by phosphoimaging (Fig. 4C) and its quantitative evaluation (Fig. 4D). These experiments showed largely unchanged RNA-binding for PA S395E, while RNA-binding was severely compromised upon phospho-mimetic mutation of Y393 either alone or in combination with S395.Figure 4PA Y393 phosphorylation prevents polymerase binding to the 5′-termini of vRNA and cRNA. (A) For convenient visibility only the PA subunit and the positions of Y393 and S395 phosphorylation sites are shown, the 5′ end of the vRNA forming a stem-loop is displayed in blue. The structures were displayed using Pymol (PDB: 4WSB). (B) The trimeric polymerase complex was expressed in 239T cells and purified using the TAP tag. The purified material was analyzed for purity and integrity of the polymerase subunits by silver staining (upper) and immunoblotting (lower) as shown. (C) The purified polymerase was incubated with the radiolabeled 5′ ends of vRNA or cRNA in the presence of their respective unlabeled 3′ promoters. After UV crosslinking the RNA/polymerase complex, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the dried gel was analyzed by phosphorimaging. (D) Quantitative analysis of three different RNA-binding experiments, each performed with a different preparation of purified IAV polymerase. After subtraction of background obtained in the control lacking the PA protein the data were normalized to the silver-stained input control, the intensity of the WT polymerase was set to 100%. Data are mean ± SEM (**P ≤ 0.01 and ***P ≤ 0.001).Full size imageDiscussionThe regulation of RNA polymerase function by phosphorylation is a widely used principle occurring from yeast to humans42. For influenza polymerases, evidence for direct phosphorylation-mediated control of RdRp activity was obtained only 202030. This study showed that different phosphorylations occurring on the catalytic PB1 subunit control either RNA binding, transcription or alternatively have no apparent function, similar to the PB2 T471 phosphorylation investigated here. Our data indicate that phosphorylation of PA at Y393 and S395 lead to impaired polymerase function. Minigenome reporter assays and primer extension analyses showed that phosphorylation at S395 leaves remaining polymerase function, and consistently virions harboring the PA S395E mutant could be rescued. The effects of the S395E mutation on transcription were more pronounced in the in vitro system (Fig. 3C) than in the cell-based reporter assays (Fig. 3A, B), suggesting the presence of compensatory mechanisms within the cell that might include changes in protein/protein interactions or conformation. The transcriptional defect caused by the mutation mimicking permanent Y393 phosphorylation is more severe and introduction of phospho-mimetic amino acids at Y393 and S395 completely shuts down the activity of the viral polymerase. Such a double mutation might also affect the overall structure of the PA arch, consistent with the notion that also the PA YS 393, 395 FA mutant shows reduced RNA interaction. Although the interactions between the polymerase subunits are largely unaffected by PA phosphorylations (see suppl. Fig. S2) we cannot rule out potential effects on the different conformation states that the holoenzyme can adopt. Since the modification of tyrosine and serine is mediated by different kinases43, individual modification of the respective side chains would be a suitable mechanism to gradually decrease RdRp activity. The analysis of phospho-mutants for PB130 and also PA (this study) showed that phospho-deficient mutants are more tolerated than phospho-mimetic mutants. This is consistent with the notion that regulated activities are mediated by dynamically altered phosphorylations, which is ensured by the balanced activity of kinases and counteracting phosphatases44. This study shows that inactivation of polymerase function by PA Y393 phosphorylation will involve impaired binding of vRNA and cRNA, as it was also predicted for PB1 phosphorylation at S67330. PA phosphorylation at S395 reduces activity of the viral polymerase without affecting RNA binding, suggesting that this modification might affect other features of the polymerase. This modification might influence the 3D-structure of the polymerase, which can assume discrete conformational states to allow different positioning of the distinct RNA templates15,45,46. In principle, PA modification could also affect further features of the polymerase, as it was revealed by the analysis of PB1 phosphorylation. While PB1 phosphorylation at S673 selectively deactivated mRNA production without affecting replication, other modifications either had no discernible effect (S216 and S384) or completely blocked RdRp activity (S478 and T223)30. These phosphorylations most likely do not represent an antiviral strategy of the host cell, since the modification sites are evolutionarily conserved although they can be mutated to phospho-deficient residues without loss-of-function. It is therefore possible that modifications of this multifunctional machine control its different activities during viral infection such as the switch from mRNA production to cRNA generation. However, similar to eukaryotic RNA polymerase, also initiation and elongation of transcription could be controlled by phosphorylations. While there are numerous publications on the effects of protein kinases and phosphatases on IAV polymerase function47,48,49,50, studies on the importance of individual phosphorylations on polymerase function are still in their infancy, raising a number of unresolved questions. As the polymerase is simultaneously modified by multiple phosphorylations at various subunits, it will be relevant to identify these modification patterns occurring for the endogenous polymerase in a time-resolved fashion, thus allowing to investigate their interplay and functional relevance. Furthermore, it would be exciting to learn to what extent polymerases engaged in the production of mRNA, cRNA or vRNA differ not only in their conformation16, but possibly also in their phosphorylation patterns.Materials and methodsAntibodies, primers and reagentsThis information is given in suppl. Table S2.Cell cultureHuman embryonic kidney 293T cells (293T, ATCC: CRL-3216), Madin-Darby and canine kidney cells (MDCK II, ATCC: CRL-2936) and murine MLE-15 lung epithelial cells (Cellosaurus: CVCL_D581) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown in an incubator at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2.Sequence alignment and structural modelingAll previously published protein sequences of non-human IAV and human IAV PB2, PB1, and PA (before August 2022) were collated from the Influenza Virus Resource at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)51. Laboratory strains were excluded from the analyses to eliminate sample biases. Identical sequences were collapsed and filtered to ensure that each strain was only represented once in the dataset. All assembled protein sequences were aligned using MAFFT v 7.505 as available in the Cipres Science Gateway (https://www.phylo.org) with subsequent manual adjustment to correct frame shift errors using BioEdit. The downstream analyses were based on a data set of 31,276 of PB2, 31,526 of PB1, 31,523 of PA sequences isolated from non-human species, 33,084 of PB2, 32,050 of PB1, 32,933 of PA human IAV sequences. Protein structures (PDB accession number 4WSB) were analyzed using Pymol (version 2.4.1).Generation of recombinant IAVsRecombinant SC35M viruses were generated by using a set of eight plasmids based on the bidirectional pHW2000 plasmid reverse genetics system32. A co-culture of 293T and MDCK II cells (ratio 3:1) was used, as these cells are suitable and frequently used to produce recombinant SC35M viruses32,34,52. Cells were grown to 70% confluence and transfected with 1 μg DNA of each plasmid encoding the eight viral segments by using Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The medium was removed 6 h post transfection (h.p.t.), and fresh DMEM supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) BSA, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies) was added. To monitor the successful de novo propagation of IAVs, the transfected dishes were screened for the appearance of a cytopathic effect (CPE) each day. The cell culture supernatant was harvested 48 h.p.t. and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. A 500 μl aliquot of each supernatant was used to infect MDCK II cells, which were then further incubated for 48–72 h. The viruses rescued from these cells were titrated by foci assays and stored at − 80 °C until further use, the successful introduction of mutations was confirmed by sequencing.Virus infection and titer determinationFor multi-cycle infections, MLE-15 cells were infected with SC35M viruses in PBS++/BSA (PBS containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies)) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. After adsorption for 1 h at room temperature (RT), the inoculum was removed and monolayers were washed three times with PBS++. An appropriate amount of infection medium (DMEM supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) BSA and penicillin/streptomycin) was added and cells were incubated for the indicated periods at 37 °C. Infectious particles in the cell supernatants were quantified by focus forming assays on MDCK II cells grown in 96-well plates. These were infected with 20 μl virus samples serially diluted in PBS++ (dilution from 10–1 to 10–7) for 1 h at RT. The inoculum was replaced by 150 μl Avicel-medium (MEM supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 0.3% (w/v) BSA, 0.3% (w/v) NaHCO3, 0.01% (w/v) DEAE Dextran, 1.25% (w/v) Avicel®). The cells were further incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% (v/v) CO2. To detect foci of infected cells resulting from an infectious particle, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 150 μl fixing solution (4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Roth, Germany) in PBS++) for 1 h at RT. The solution was then discarded and cells were washed 3× with PBS++ containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20. The cells were then incubated with primary antibody (50 μl/well) recognizing the IAV NP protein diluted 1:100 in PBS++ containing 3% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at RT. Then cells were washed 3× with PBS++ containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 and incubated with 50 μl/well horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody diluted 1:1000 in PBS++ containing 3% (w/v) BSA, for 1 h at RT. Cells were then washed 3× with PBS++ containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 and incubated with 40 μl staining solution for 40 min at 37 °C in the dark. After staining, the substrate was removed and cells were washed 2× with H2O to remove salts. To detect and quantify foci, the 96-well plates were scanned using a BioSys Bioreader® (BioSys, Karben, Germany).Cell-based minigenome luciferase assaysMinigenome experiments were performed to investigate the activity of the reconstituted polymerase and its mutated forms in 293T cells. Minigenome assays co-expressing viral v/mRNAs encoding the SC35M PB2, PB1, PA and NP were done upon transfection of 293T cells (6-well plates, 2 × 105 cells/well) with either 1 μg each of pHW2000-SC35M-PB2, pHW2000-SC35M-PB1, pHW2000-SC35M-PA, pHW2000-SC35M-NP, together with 200 ng of a plasmid expressing a Pol1-promoter driven vRNA-like transcript encoding the firefly luciferase reporter gene (pHW72-Luci) and 20 ng pCI-neoRenilla-Luci. Minigenome assays expressing only the viral RdRp and NPproteins were done in a similar way by transfection of pCAGGS plasmids encoding PB2, PB1, PA (each 125 ng) and NP (800 ng) together with 200 ng pHW72-Luci and 20 ng pCI-neoRenilla-Luci. Transfection was performed using linear polyethylenimine for 5 h as described53. 24 h.p.t. the cells were harvested, washed, lysed for 15 min in 150 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were detected using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Renilla activities were used for data normalization and expression of the viral proteins was ensured by Western blotting.RNA isolation and primer extension analysisFor the in vitro reconstitution of the SC35M polymerase, five plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells in 6-well plates. The first plasmid, pPOLI-CAT-RT, contains the CAT open reading frame in minus sense as a reporter gene, flanked by the 3′ and 5′ noncoding regions of the NS RNA segment of influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1). Expression of the influenza virus-like RNA is driven by a human RNA Pol I promoter and a ribozyme sequence that generates the desired 3′ end by autocatalytic cleavage. The other four plasmids, pCAGGS-PB1, -PB2, -PA, and -NP express the influenza virus SC35M PB1, PB2, PA, and NP proteins. The total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) at 48 h.p.t. and carried out as previously described54. Briefly, RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using specific 32P-labeled primers detecting the CAT reporter (v-, c-, mRNA) and a primer for cellular 5S rRNA as a loading control. The products were resolved on a 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea and visualized by phosphorimaging on a Amersham™ Typhoon™ instrument.Co-IPs, SDS-PAGE and Western blottingpCAGGS plasmids encoding PB2, PB1, PA (each 1.5 μg), NP (3 μg), and a Pol-1 promoter-driven vRNA-like firefly luciferase-encoding transcript pHW72-Luci (500 ng) were expressed in 293T cells at the indicated combinations. Cells were lysed 48 h later in IGEPAL buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 10 mM NaF, 0.5 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 µg/ml leupeptine, and 2 µg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 20 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C and 16,000×g. The supernatant was then used for IPs, while 10% of the supernatants were collected as input controls. IPs were performed in the presence of 25 µl protein A/G agarose beads (Millipore) and 1 µg of anti-PA antibody. After rotation for 4 h at 4 °C, beads were washed five times with 1 ml IGEPAL buffer at 4 °C for 10 min and eluted in 1× SDS sample buffer. Denaturing SDS-PAGE was performed as described53, PA phosphorylation was determined in the presence of Phos-tag™ acrylamide (FUJIFILM Wako) in the separating gel. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane as described55, immunoreactive bands were detected using the Western Lightning Plus-ECL reagent (Perkin Elmer) and visualized on a ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad).Purification of recombinant IAV polymerase and RNA cross-linking293T cells were grown on 10 cm dishes and transfected with 3 μg of each of pcDNA-WSN-PB2-TAP, pcDNA-WSN-PB1, and pcDNA-WSN-PA using linear polyethylenimine. After 2 days, cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 500 μl lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 1 µg/ml leupeptine, and 2 µg/ml aprotinin) and placed on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 17,000×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was diluted with 2 ml 150 mM NaCl together with 50 μl pre-washed IgG Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads, followed by rotating at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then collected and washed three times with cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride) and once with cold cleavage buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride). The bound IAV polymerase complex on the IgG beads was then resuspended in 200 μl cleavage buffer and released by incubation with 2.5 μl TEV protease (NEB #P8112) on a rotating wheel at 4 °C overnight to remove the protein A domains, but leaving a calmodulin-binding domain (CBD). The beads were then centrifuged at 17,000×g for 5 min, and the eluates containing the IAV polymerase complex were collected, aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at – 80 °C until use. The protein levels of partially purified recombinant IAV polymerase were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining using a SilverXpress kit (Invitrogen). The radioactive capped 5′ vRNA/cRNA promoter binding to the IAV polymerase was set up in a 10 μl reaction, as described previously40. Purified IAV polymerase was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 1 mM DTT, 2 U/μl RNasin (Promega) together with 5 × 104 cpm [γ32P]-labeled 5′ vRNA promoter (5′-AGUAGAAACAAGGCC-3′) and 0.5 μM of the unlabeled 3′ vRNA promoter (vRNA: 5′-GGCCUGCUUUUGCU-3′. Alternatively the polymerase was incubated with 5 × 104 cpm [γ32P]-labeled 5′ cRNA promoter (5′-AGCAAAAGCAGGCC-3′) together with 0.5 μM of the unlabeled 3′ cRNA promoter (5′-GGCCUUGUUUCUACU-3′). The reaction mixtures were then transferred into a 96-well plate and UV irradiated (254 nm) using a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene) for 10 min. Cross-linked complexes were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging on a Amersham™ Typhoon™ instrument.Quantification and statistical analysisImage Lab 6.0.1 (Bio-Rad) was used for image acquisition and densitometric analysis of Western blot data. Quantification of 32P signals acquired by the Amersham™ Typhoon™ platform was done by subtracting the background values "-PB2" control (primer extension) or "-PA" control (RNA-binding). Data were normalized to loading controls and GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to perform statistical analysis and generation of graphs. The statistical significance for multiple comparisons was calculated using a one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc analysis of pair-wise comparisons to WT using Graphpad Prism 9.Immunofluorescence staining293T cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and transfected with expression plasmids as indicated in the figure legend. One day post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were rinsed three times in PBS and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS containing 0,3% (v/v) Triton X-100. Coverslips were subsequently incubated with the anti-PA antibody, diluted 1:2000 in PBS containing 0.3% (w/v) BSA and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, for 90 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS + 0,3% (v/v) Triton X-100 cells were incubated with the secondary Alexa488-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:3000 dilution) in the dark. After 1 h incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and the nuclear DNA was stained with Hoechst 33324 (Invitrogen). Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol mounting medium and stored at 4 °C. Stained cells were analyzed using an Eclipse TE2000-E microscope (Nikon) and a 63× oil-immersion lens. At least > 30 healthy interphase cells of three independent experiments were analyzed and pictures were taken with an OCRA-spark digital CMOS camera (C11440-36U, Hamamatsu).BiosafetyAll experiments using infectious virus were performed in accordance with German biosafety regulations pertaining to the propagation of IAVs.

Download PDF Copy By Dr. Chinta SidharthanReviewed by Danielle Ellis, B.Sc.Apr 27 2023 In a recent study published in Emerging Infectious Disease Journal, researchers from the United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) reported on the recent outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus among domesticated and wild birds in 39 U.S. states and discussed the potential risks to humans. Study: Risk for Infection in Humans after Exposure to Birds Infected with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus, United States, 2022. Image Credit: Rost9/Shutterstock.com Background The HPAI virus is an influenza A virus belonging to the hemagglutinin 5 neuraminidase 1 (H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b and was detected among poultry flocks and migratory birds worldwide in 2021. In early 2022, the virus was detected from wild birds harvested by hunters in the states of North and South Carolina in the U.S. Subsequently, other states also reported the detection of the H5N1 virus from domesticated and wild birds. Although the incidence of H5N1 infection among humans has been reported in China, Chile, Ecuador, the United Kingdom, and Spain (two, one, one, one, and two cases, respectively), the risk of H5N1 infection risk among humans who have been exposed to potentially infected birds is still unclear. About the study In the present study, the researchers used a system of active symptom monitoring between February and September 2022 to estimate the risk of symptomatic H5N1 infection among humans exposed to birds. Additionally, they developed a serological testing-based surveillance protocol to monitor humans exposed to birds infected with H5N1 to detect asymptomatic infections. The U.S. Department of Agriculture regularly monitors wild and domesticated birds to monitor avian influenza. The CDC recommends active symptom monitoring for individuals such as farm workers, flock owners, and cullers who have been exposed to wild, domesticated, or backyard flocks of birds or the environments in which infected birds have been found. This active symptom monitoring comprises communication from the health departments telephonically or through texts or emails for ten days following the most recent exposure and applies to individuals who were not wearing adequate or intact personal protective equipment (PPE) when they were exposed to the birds. From individuals who exhibited symptoms similar to influenza A(H5) infections within ten days of exposure, nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were collected for real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) analysis at public health labs in the state. In some cases, samples were also collected from asymptomatic individuals. Positive results were verified by the CDC. Additionally, to determine the risk of asymptomatic infections in humans, the CDC invited all symptomatic and asymptomatic exposed individuals to participate in diagnostic testing for influenza A(H5) by submitting respiratory and convalescent and acute serum samples for microneutralization and hemagglutinin inhibition assays. Results The results reported that between February and September 2022, H5N1 infections were detected in a total of 2,199 wild birds across 45 U.S. states and 229 backyard flocks and 200 commercial poultry farms in 39 U.S. states. Out of the 4.351 individuals who were exposed to potentially infected birds, 3,658 completed the active symptom monitoring of 10 days. Of these 3,658, 3% (134) experienced one or more symptoms similar to an influenza infection symptom, but only one individual tested positive for influenza A(H5). Related StoriesPasteurization effectively reduces H5N1 virus in milk but further testing is essentialCurcumin compound reactivates Epstein–Barr virus, offering safer cancer therapyH5N1 bird flu is mutating fast and jumping to mammals - could the next pandemic be here?Additionally, 22 nasal samples collected from individuals exposed to birds tested negative for H5N1. The serum samples obtained from 17 of these 22 individuals did not indicate elevated antibody titers against the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus. Based on the fact that out of over 4,000 individuals who were exposed to birds and were tested, only one had an rRT-PCR confirmed case of influenza A(H5), the researchers from the CDC concluded that the avian-to-human transmission risk of H5N1 was low for individuals who were exposed to domesticated or wild birds potentially infected with H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in the United States. Conclusions To summarize, the researchers from the CDC assessed the risk of H5N1 infections among individuals exposed to wild and domesticated birds potentially infected with the HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus. Overall, the findings suggested that the risk of transmission of the H5N1 virus from infected birds to humans was very low. However, the researchers cautioned that it is important to monitor exposed individuals, and the increasing number of influenza A(H5) infections among other mammals indicates the potential for the risk profile of the virus to change very quickly.

Covid-19, H3N2 virus and malaria are three diseases that have overlapping symptoms. So, it can be confusing to differentiate between the three. Here's how you can differentiate between these diseases. Covid-19 vs H3N2 influenza vs Malaria. Image courtesy: Adobe Stock Published by Dr Vijay Kumar Gurjar Updated On: 24 Apr 2023, 01:54 pm IST 186 Channel ChannelAmid the surge in viral flu infections, it can be challenging to distinguish whether the fever and body aches experienced by individuals are caused by Covid-19, H3N2 influenza or mosquito-borne malaria. While Covid-19 is anticipated to be on the verge of turning endemic from the pandemic, the country recently witnessed a huge spike in the cases of Covid and H3N2 influenza as well. Once monsoon will hit the ground, malaria might season out to pose a surging risk in the days ahead. With malaria accounting for approximately 88 percent of all malaria cases in the South-East Asia region in 2019, according to a World Health Organization report, it has been an area of concern for the public health authorities in the country. However, there has been a decline in the number of malaria cases in recent years stated by the same report aids motivation in curbing the menace of malaria.Despite the different modes of transmission, the primary symptoms of these illnesses are similar, starting with fever and body aches. However, closely monitoring the varying symptoms of these diseases, it will be beneficial to differentiate between Covid-19, H3N2 influenza and malaria.Covid-19 Vs H3N2 influenza Vs MalariaHere are the differences between the three health issues:1. Transmission modeMalaria is distinct from Covid-19 and H3N2 as it is not transmitted from one individual to another. This is because the Plasmodium parasite that causes malaria is spread via bites from infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for Covid-19 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets, while the H3N2 influenza virus can spread through both respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces.How is malaria transmitted?

With malaria, prominent symptoms include chills, muscle pain, nausea and vomiting among others, and if left untreated it can turn severe and debilitating resulting in complications such as anaemia, kidney failure, and cerebral malaria, which can be life-threatening. In the case of Covid-19 and H3N2 influenza, fever, cough, fatigue, sore throat and runny nose are the primary symptoms. However, Covid-19 also presents with additional symptoms such as loss of taste or smell and shortness of breath.3. Incubation periodThe duration of the incubation period plays a crucial role in distinguishing between these illnesses. Covid-19 symptoms usually manifest between 2 to 14 days following exposure, with an average incubation time of 5-6 days. In contrast, the H3N2 flu virus has an incubation period of 1-4 days, whereas the incubation period of malaria can extend from 7 days to multiple months.4. Treatment methodsThe modalities of treating Covid-19, malaria, and H3N2 influenza differ significantly owing to the distinct etiologies of these diseases. Malaria is typically treated with antimalarial medications alongside effective measures to contain mosquito spread. In contrast, Covid-19 necessitates a multi pronged approach including medication, supportive care, and vaccination. On the other hand, H3N2 influenza is managed using antiviral agents along with symptomatic treatment to alleviate fever, cough, and sore throat.How are covid, H3N2 and malaria treated? Image courtesy: Shutterstock5. Tests that determine the infectionDetermining the kind of infection is responsible for similar symptoms from three different diseases, there are distinguished diagnostic tests available. The most commonly used method to detect malaria is the microscopic examination of blood smears, which is based on the detection of the malaria parasite in red blood cells. Alternatively, rapid diagnostic tests that detect malaria antigens in blood samples are widely used due to their ease of use and rapid turnaround time. The diagnosis of H3N2 influenza is typically made using antigen tests that detect the viral antigen in respiratory secretions, while PCR-based assays can provide more accurate results. In contrast, the diagnosis of Covid-19 relies heavily on PCR-based tests that detect viral RNA in respiratory secretions.The last wordWith the continuous emergence of fatal infections affecting numerous lives, discerning between Covid-19, H3N2 influenza and malaria can be challenging due to their overlapping symptoms. However, understanding the transmission modes, distinct symptoms, incubation periods, treatment methods and diagnostic tests can aid in identifying the infection. Most importantly, consulting a doctor the moment these symptoms persist for a certain period of time is essential.Get latest updates on health and wellness along with Health News Related Topics: covid-19About The Author Dr Vijay Kumar Gurjar Dr Vijay Kumar Gurjar is a senior consultant and Head of the Department of Geriatric Medicine at Primus Super Speciality Hospital, New Delhi.

Advertisement The US is currently experiencing its worst-ever outbreak of bird flu, also known as avian influenza — and a new study has found that the strain could become endemic in the country.The outbreak is "wiping out everything in numbers we've never seen before," Jennifer Mullinax, an assistant professor of environmental science and technology at the University of Maryland, told Sky News. The new H5N1 strain has already killed over 58 million chickens, turkeys, and other birds, Reuters reported.The US is no stranger to the impact of the disease, with the H5N8 strain having led to the culling of 50 million birds in 2015. But the new, more contagious strain is particularly affecting wild birds, Sky News reported. Advertisement Bill Powers with his flock of white turkeys, kept under shelter to prevent exposure to bird flu, on November 14, 2022 in Townsend, Delaware. Nathan Howard/Getty Images "Unlike H5N8, this disease is heavily impacting wild birds," Johanna Harvey, a postdoctoral researcher and the lead author of the study published in Conservation Biology at the University of Maryland, said. "It's difficult to estimate how many birds are truly affected across wild populations, but we're seeing dramatic disease impacts in raptors, sea birds, and colonial nesting birds. And we now have the highest amount of poultry loss to avian influenza, so this is a worst-case scenario," she added.The researchers believe that bird flu will probably become endemic — a phenomenon where a disease is constantly present within an area or community in the US — which could affect food security and the economy. Advertisement Last week, the US government started testing four new bird-flu vaccines to try and protect the poultry from this mass outbreak, Reuters reported.Are humans in danger? The disease can and does affect humans, but it's rare. The first case of H5N1 infection in a human in the US was reported in April 2022. A man was also diagnosed with the virus in Chile, according to the World Health Organization. Advertisement Most cases of human infection have been in Southeast Asia, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were only three cases of human infection in 2023, two in Cambodia, and one in China. One of the people infected in Cambodia, an 11-year-old girl, died from the illness. Speaking about this death to AP, James Wood, the head of the department of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University, said there is no reason to be unduly concerned about human infection with bird flu."Tragic though this case in Cambodia is, we expect there to be some cases of clinical disease with such a widespread infection. Clearly, the virus needs careful monitoring and surveillance to check that it has not mutated or recombined, but the limited numbers of cases of human disease have not increased markedly, and this one case in itself does not signal the global situation has suddenly changed," he said.

Advertisement This new strain of bird flu has killed more than 58 million chickens, turkeys, and other birds. PATRICK T. FALLON/Getty Images The unprecedented spread of disease and 2022's high inflation rates raising farmers' costs caused the jump — and it doesn't look like it will change soon.

Study: Replication of Novel Zoonotic-Like Influenza A(H3N8) Virus in Ex Vivo Human Bronchus and Lung. Image Credit: joshimerbin/Shutterstock.com Background Reassortments between avian influenza viruses from wild birds and domesticated poultry result in viruses that can cross species boundaries sporadically, causing zoonotic infections. The zoonotic influenza viruses H7N9, H5N1, and H10N8 are thought to be viruses with the internal genes of H9N2 with acquired neuraminidase and hemagglutinin from wild birds. Two cases of H3N8 infections among humans were recently reported from Hunan province and Henan, China, in 2022 — the first was acute respiratory distress syndrome in a four-year-old boy, and the second was mild infection in a five-year-old boy. Additionally, phylogenetic analyses indicated that novel H3N8 viruses resulted from reassortments comprising the European avian H3 gene, the North American avian N8 gene originating from wild birds and wild-bird avian influenza virus, respectively, and the H9N2 internal genes from avian influenza viruses from poultry in China. Compared to the human influenza A viruses (H3N2), the antigenic profiles of novel avian H3N8 viruses are significantly different. The human population exhibits very little cross-reactive immunity to the H3N8 viruses. About the study In the present study, the researchers isolated the novel H3N8 virus from chickens since the virus had a 99.1% and 98.7% similarity in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, respectively, with the viruses causing zoonotic infections among humans in China. The avian H3N8 virus was isolated from droppings of wild birds and found to be genetically dissimilar to the zoonotic virus. A few other avian and human influenza viruses were also used in the study. The viruses were propagated in eggs or Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The viruses were cultured in ex vivo human lung and bronchial cultures. The viral replication was assessed using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to measure the viral matrix protein segment ribonucleic acid (RNA). Infectious titers of the viruses were measured using the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay. Influenza A nucleoprotein immunohistochemical staining was also performed on the infected tissue cultures after 48 hours of infection. Results The results indicated that in the bronchial tissue cultures, the levels of viral RNA were similar for the novel H3N8, avian H3N8, and H5N1 viruses. The pH1N1 virus had the highest viral RNA levels, while H9N2 had higher viral RNA levels than the avian and novel H3N8 and H5N1 viral strains. The H5N1 virus had the highest viral RNA levels in the human lung tissue culture, followed by the H9N2 strain. The avian H3N8 virus had the lowest viral RNA levels in lung tissue. Related StoriesMasks and smart seating cut COVID-19 risks on flights, review findsOropouche virus spreads in South America as scientists warn of potential outbreaks in the U.S.Unusual surge in children's pneumonia cases in England linked to Mycoplasma pneumoniaeThe TCID50 assay results indicated similar patterns with the highest infectious viral titers for pH1N1 in bronchial tissue cultures and H5N1 in lung tissue cultures. For H9N2, the infectious viral titers, and viral RNA copies showed a discrepant trend, with high viral RNA copies but low viral titers in bronchial tissue cultures. The avian H3N8 virus had the lowest viral titers in lung tissue. Furthermore, novel H3N8 virus did not replicate well in the MDCK cells but replicated well in the avian cells, indicating that the virus has not yet successfully adapted to mammalian hosts. This finding was also confirmed by the low replication titers of the novel H3N8 virus in human lung and bronchial tissue cultures. The immunohistochemical analyses reported that the most extensive levels of antigen distribution were observed for bronchial tissue infected with pH1N1, while bronchial tissue infected with H9N2, H5N1, and novel H3N8 viral strains showed moderate levels of antigen distribution. Tissue cultured infected with avian H3N8 showed no antigen staining. Similar to the qRT-PCR and TCID50 assay results, the lung tissue immunohistochemistry results showed extensive antigen staining for cells infected with H5N1, followed by lung tissue infected with pH1N1, novel H3N8, and avian H3N8 viral strains. Conclusions Overall, the findings indicated that the novel and avian H3N8 viral strains showed low replication in human lung and bronchial tissue cultures compared to other human and avian influenza viruses. Therefore, the ability of these viruses to transmit between humans is limited, and these viral strains are unlikely to cause severe diseases. However, the reassortment between avian influenza viruses among domesticated and wild birds continues to present the risk of potential zoonotic infections. Journal reference: Hui, K. P. Y., Ho, J. C.

But mystery shrouds a lot of other things about it. Why do you seem to get them so often while your best friend stays well? And more importantly, how can you stay healthy this year? Get the lowdown on the all-too-common common cold.What Is It?It's an illness caused by a tiny, infectious thing called a virus. More than 200 types lead to your misery, but the most common one is the rhinovirus, which is thought to be responsible for at least 50% of colds.Â Other viruses that can cause colds include coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and parainfluenza.Colds cause a lot of people to stay home. The CDC says 22 million school days are lost each year in the U.S. because of them. Some estimates say that Americans have 1 billion colds a year.For more detail, see Common Cold Causes.How a Common Cold StartsYou can catch it from another person who is infected with the virus. This can happen by direct physical contact with someone who has a cold, or by touching a surface contaminated with their germs -- like a computer keyboard, doorknob or spoon --- and then touching your nose or mouth. You can also catch it from infected droplets in the air released by a sneeze or a cough.A cold begins when a virus attaches to the lining of your nose or throat. Your immune system -- the body's defense against germs -- sends out whiteÂ blood cellsÂ to attack this invader. Unless you've had a run-in with that exact strain of the virus before, the initial attack can failÂ and your body sends in reinforcements. Your nose and throat get inflamed and make a lot of mucus. With so much of your energy directed at fighting the cold virus, you're left feeling tired and miserable.One myth that needs to get busted: Getting chilly or wet doesn't cause you to get sick. But there are things that make you prone to come down with a cold. For example, you're more likely to catch one if you're extremely tired, under emotional distress, or haveÂ allergiesÂ with nose and throat symptoms.Common Cold SymptomsWhen a cold strikes, you may have symptoms like:Scratchy or sore throatSneezingStuffy noseWatery eyesMucus draining from your nose into your throatMore severe symptoms, such asÂ high feverÂ or muscle aches, may be a sign that you have theÂ fluÂ rather than a cold.For more detail, see Common Cold Symptoms: What You Might Feel.Kids and ColdsChildren have about 5-7 colds per year. A big part of the reason: They spend time at school or inÂ day careÂ centers where they're in close contact with other kids most of the day. Also, kids arenât as conscientious about sneezing into the crook of their arm or frequent hand washing â not to mention keeping their hands to themselves.They may not have built up immunity to as many varieties (or strains) of colds as an adult.For in-depth information, see Children and Colds.Preparing for Cold SeasonIn the U.S., most colds happen during the fall and winter. Beginning in late August or early September, the rate increases slowly for a few weeks and remains high until March or April, when it goes down. The reason may partly have to do with the opening of schools. Cold weather may also play a role because it leads you to spend more time indoors with less air circulation, where you're in closer contact with people who are contagious.Changes in humidity in different seasons may also affect how often people get sick. The most common cold viruses survive better outside the body. Also, cold weather may make the lining of your nose drier and more vulnerable toÂ an infection by a virus.When to Call the Doctor About a ColdMost colds last about 7 to 10 days, but if your symptoms linger, you may need to call the doctor. Sometimes, colds lead to an infection by bacteria in in yourÂ lungs,Â sinuses, or ears. If that happens, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, which work against bacteria but not against viruses.For more detail, see Common Cold Complications.More Questions About Colds?Need more info about the common cold?

A new RAT can test for both at home with a single swabBy Thea van de MortelThe ConversationTopic:COVID-19Tue 25 Apr 2023Tuesday 25 April 2023Tue 25 Apr 2023 at 7:12pmIt may be hard to know if you are suffering from COVID or flu but a new at-home RAT test can tell you. (Pixabay)abc.net.auews/covid-flu-new-rat-test-can-diagnose-both/102261392Link copiedShareShare articleIf you have respiratory symptoms as we head towards winter and flu season, could it be COVID or the flu? Or something else entirely?Now, we have a range of home tests that can distinguish between flu and COVID with one swab. They use technology you might be used to. They're rapid antigen tests or RATs.Here's what you need to know about the tests, why they might be useful, and what they don't tell us.Loading Twitter contentWhat's new about these tests?Most people were introduced to RATs while testing at home for COVID.But RATs to detect the flu have been available for years, albeit used by health workers to test patients.The latest RATs are different for two reasons. One, they detect both COVID and flu with one swab (a "combo" test). Two, they can be used at home.The first of these combo home tests for flu/COVID was approved in September 2022. Now several are on the market.These tests let you check, with one test kit, if you are infected with two types of flu (influenza A and B) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID).How do they work?These RATs contain antibodies that can detect influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2.Some kits have a test cassette with one well to add drops to and one window labelled: C (control), A (influenza A), B (influenza B) and T (test for COVID).Some test cassettes have two wells, like this one. TGA (TGA.gov.au)Some tests have two wells and two test windows. You view the influenza results in one window and the COVID results in the other.In the influenza window you will see markings C, A and B. If a line becomes visible at A (and C), you have tested positive for influenza A. If a line becomes visible at B (and C), you are positive for influenza B. If lines are visible at A, B and C you have tested positive for both influenza A and B.If either A or B has a line but not C, or if none of them do, the test is invalid and you will need to take a new one.The COVID window works the same way as in a standard RAT for COVID. If a line becomes visible at C and T, you are COVID-positive. If there is a line at C but not T, you are COVID-negative. If there is no line at C the test is invalid.Why take the test? Three reasonsSubsidised COVID antivirals eligibility widenedPhoto shows A man wearing a surgical mask holding up a packet of antiviral drugsAn additional 160,000 Australians are now able to access subsidised COVID-19 antiviral treatments after the federal government expanded eligibility criteria under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.If you have respiratory symptoms, there are some practical reasons for knowing whether you are positive for COVID or flu.One, if you know you have COVID, this will affect the timing of your booster vaccine. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation recommends adults wait six months after a COVID infection to get a booster to increase the time you have protective immunity. So it helps to know if you have been infected.Two, if you need antiviral treatment, the medications differ depending on whether you have flu or COVID.Three, knowing you have flu or COVID means you can take steps to protect others. This could mean working at home, avoiding contact with vulnerable people, and wearing a mask in company.Which test to use? When to use it?The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) lists approved tests on its website. Type the term "combination" in the search box. All combo tests currently listed use nasal swabs to collect the sample.Most are listed as "very high sensitivity". This means they get the same result in detecting positive cases as the gold standard PCR test 95 per cent of the time. The others have "high sensitivity" (90 per cent agreement with a PCR).The best time to take the test is within four days of developing symptoms, as this is when it is easiest to detect both flu and COVID. The tests are more reliable if you have symptoms.What if I have symptoms but the test is negative?One possibility is that your viral load was not high enough to be detected. You could take another test a day or so later to check again.Another is you may have a different virus. Viruses that cause respiratory symptoms include rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and common cold coronaviruses.Other pathogens (disease-causing microorganisms) or health conditions can also cause respiratory symptoms. If you are concerned, consult your doctor for medical advice.Hundred of questions continue to stream in daily as the pandemic still raises uncertainties. (Source: Unsplash)What else should I know?As each test differs, make sure you follow the instructions for that specific test.The price of combo kits advertised online varies from $8.95 to $59 (excluding delivery) so it pays to shop around.It's worth trying to avoid catching the flu rather than testing for it later. Flu vaccination reduces your chances of catching the flu by 40-60 per cent when the vaccine is well matched to circulating strains. Flu vaccines for the 2023 flu season are available now.Thea van de Mortel is Professor of Nursing in the School of Nursing and Midwifery at Griffith University.

The public notice was issued Thursday by the Director of Education following a Cabinet directive to close all schools in order to curb the rapid spread of the virus and also to assist with the medical personnel shortage in the hospitals. The Director General of Health, Aiono Dr Alec Ekeroma voiced concern over the rapid increase in the number of children now affected by the influenza B flu virus spreading in the country. The total number of cases recorded as of last week stands at 2441. “Three weeks ago, it was noted that 150 children infected were recorded a day,” said Aiono. He said they thought it was a “fluke” however, the same number was recorded the next day and they realised they had a problem on their hands. “We noted the number of recorded cases had tripled including cases from other district hospitals,” Aiono told the media. The recorded number of cases at the end of March was 519 and last week, the number went up to 1500 and most of them were admitted. He said it takes at least 4 to 5 weeks for a person to be affected by any flu, but influenza B now spreading in the country is much more severe in children. The total number of cases recorded 6 -12 March was 1275 but last week, the number has reached 2441 and the age group affected is between the ages of 1-12 years. Aiono confirmed that the Ministry is facing a dilemma as the outbreak has put a strain on the available medical resources. “We do not have enough staff to cope with the increasing numbers of cases, and the medical team working at the paediatric unit are overworked,” said Aiono. He also confirmed that there are 70 admitted cases at the paediatric ward, but there are only 54 beds, so other children are being transferred to other hospital units and to district hospitals. With the numbers expected to increase, there is a possibility of asking for medical personnel assistance from New Zealand and Australia. Aino confirmed that due to the increasing number of children affected, they have requested Cabinet to extend the school holidays to another week so they could monitor the status of influenza B. He said this will give medical staff a break and to cope with the number already attended to, but also a chance to reduce the spread of the virus. “Hopefully this will reduce the number and assist the situation at the hospitals but also to avoid any serious problems,” said Aiono. Asked if the hospital has enough medicine supplies to cater not just for the flu but measles which now threatens Samoa, Aiono said they have already ordered more supplies. He also confirmed that there are enough supplies to cater for the worst.

(Photo courtesy: PTI)Daphne ClaranceNew Delhi,UPDATED: Apr 24, 2023 17:41 ISTThere has been a spike in viral flu infections since the beginning of the year and it has been challenging to distinguish fever and body aches experienced by individuals caused by Covid-19, H3N2 or malaria. With the continuous emergence of fatal infections affecting numerous lives, discerning between Covid-19, H3N2 influenza, and malaria can be challenging due to their overlapping symptoms.advertisementOnce the monsoon hits, there will be a rise in the mosquito-born disease malaria. With malaria accounting for approximately 88 per cent of all malaria cases in the South-East Asia region in 2019, according to a World Health Organisation (WHO) report, it has been an area of concern for the public health authorities in the country. ALSO READ | Do you have Covid or just a flu? Know the difference"Despite the different modes of transmission, the primary symptoms of these illnesses are similar, starting with fever and body aches. However, closely monitoring the varying symptoms having slight differences can be beneficial in distinguishing Covid-19 and H3N2 influenza from malaria," said Dr Vijay Kumar Gurjar, Senior Consultant and Head of the Department of Geriatric Medicine, Primus Super Speciality Hospital, New Delhi. Transmission mode Malaria is distinct from Covid-19 and H3N2 influenza in that it is not transmitted from one individual to another. This is because the plasmodium parasite that causes malaria is spread via bites from infected female anopheles mosquitoes. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for Covid-19 spreads through respiratory droplets, while the H3N2 influenza virus can spread through both respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. Symptoms Besides some similar symptoms like fever, headache and body aches, there is also a multitude of symptoms that differ significantly in the case of the three. With malaria, prominent symptoms include chills, muscle pain, nausea, and vomiting among others, and if left untreated it can turn severe and debilitating, resulting in complications such as anaemia, kidney failure, and cerebral malaria, which can be life-threatening. In the case of Covid-19 and H3N2 influenza, fever, cough, fatigue, sore throat, and runny nose are the primary symptoms. However, Covid-19 also presents with additional symptoms such as loss of taste or smell and shortness of breath. Determining the kind of infection is responsible for similar symptoms from three different diseases, there are distinguished diagnostic tests available. (Photo courtesy: Getty Images) Incubation periodThe duration of the incubation period plays a crucial role in distinguishing between these illnesses. Covid-19 symptoms usually manifest between 2 to 14 days following exposure, with an average incubation time of 5-6 days. The H3N2 flu virus has an incubation period of 1-4 days, whereas malaria's incubation period can extend from 7 days to many months.Treatment methods The modalities of treating Covid-19, malaria and H3N2 influenza differ significantly owing to the distinct etiologies of these diseases. Malaria is typically treated with antimalarial medications alongside effective measures to contain mosquito spread.Covid-19 necessitates a multipronged approach including medication, supportive care, and vaccination. On the other hand, H3N2 influenza is managed using antiviral agents along with symptomatic treatment to alleviate fever, cough and sore throat. The diagnosis of Covid-19 relies heavily on PCR-based tests that detect viral RNA in respiratory secretions.

"The most commonly used method to detect malaria is the microscopic examination of blood smears, which is based on the detection of the malaria parasite in red blood cells. Alternatively, rapid diagnostic tests that detect malaria antigens in blood samples are widely used due to their ease of use and rapid turnaround time," said Dr Vijay Kumar Gurjar.ALSO READ | How to save yourself from heatstroke as heatwaves send temperatures soaring across IndiaThe diagnosis of H3N2 is typically made using antigen tests that detect the viral antigen in respiratory secretions, while PCR-based assays can provide more accurate results. In contrast, the diagnosis of Covid-19 relies heavily on PCR-based tests that detect viral RNA in respiratory secretions.Most importantly, consulting a doctor the moment these symptoms persist for a certain period of time is essential.

It can cause pooches to suffer from a runny nose and cough and be deadly in extreme cases.Since then, it has become established within canines and evolved to become a dog-specific virus.But Chinese researchers have uncovered signs that the same pathogen may now be better suited to infecting humans.Tests virus samples taken from dogs infected recently were better able to recognise human cell receptors, compared to those from a decade ago. H3N2 influenza virus particles, coloured transmission electron micrographThis makes it easier for the virus particles to infect cells by penetrating the cell wall or membrane, meaning the virus may be one step closer to overcoming the hurdle that has so far stopped it taking off in humans. Writing in the journal eLife, researchers at the China Agricultural University in Beijing, said: 'Our results showed that canines may serve as intermediates for the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to humans.'Six dogs were intentionally infected with H3N2 strains as part of the study. None died, instead they were all mildly unwell.To date, there has not been a single reported case of a human being struck down with a canine influenza virus worldwide.

An outbreak of bird flu cases in humans emerged in February in Cambodia and saw an 11-year-old girl die from the virus and her 49-year-old father test positive for the H5N1 strain. Pictured above, a worker carries chickens at a market in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, on February 24, 2023 In the UK, the Animal and Plant Health Agency, an arm of DEFRA, is reviewing the bird flu risk to humans every week. The UK Health Security Agency also confirmed last month that it had updated its modelling scenarios of how an outbreak among humans could take off in the UK. All of the scenarios were assumed to have an R rate — a measure of a virus' ability to spread — of between 1.2 and 2A spate of human bird flu cases have emerged in the early parts of 2023.Earlier this year, a Cambodian man and his daughter were diagnosed with H5N1.Their cases sparked international concern, with many experts fearing their infection was proof the virus had mutated to infect people better after tearing through the world's bird population.Further testing found the Cambodian family did not have the H5N1 strain rapidly spreading among the world's wild birds — but instead a variant known to spread locally in the Prey Veng province they resided in.

Bird flu outbreak: Everything you need to know What is it?Avian flu is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds.In rare cases, it can be transmitted to humans through close contact with a dead or alive infected bird.This includes touching infected birds, their droppings or bedding. People can also catch bird flu if they kill or prepare infected poultry for eating.Wild birds are carriers, especially through migration.As they cluster together to breed, the virus spreads rapidly and is then carried to other parts of the globe.New strains tend to appear first in Asia, from where more than 60 species of shore birds, waders and waterfowl head off to Alaska to breed and mix with migratory birds from the US. Others go west and infect European species.Which strains are currently spreading?H5N1 and H3N8.So far the virus H5N1 has been detected in some 80million birds and poultry globally since September 2021 — double the previous record the year before.Not only is the virus spreading at speed, it is also killing at an unprecedented level, leading some experts to say this is the deadliest variant so far.Millions of chickens and turkeys in the UK have been culled or put into lockdown.But earlier this year, on March 27, the World Health Organization (WHO) was also informed that a Chinese woman had become the first person to ever die from the H3N8 strain.The 56-year-old woman from the southern province of Guangdong was the third person known to have been infected with the H3N8 subtype of avian influenza, according to the WHO. Although rare in people, H3N8 is common in birds, but it causes little to no sign of disease. It has also infected other mammals. Can bird flu infect people?Yes, but only 868 human cases of bird flu have been reported to the World Health Organization since 2003.The risk to people has been deemed 'low'.But people are strongly urged not to touch sick or dead birds because the virus is lethal, killing 56 per cent of people it does manage to infect.

H3N2 avian influenza or bird flu viruses were first transmitted to dogs around 2006 and have since formed stable canine lineages.A team from the China Agricultural University analysed swabs from more than 4,000 dogs.The findings, published in the journal eLife, showed that the H3N2 canine influenza viruses (CIVs) can recognise the human-cell receptors and hold the potential to replicate in humans."We found that, during adaptation in dogs, H3N2 CIVs became able to recognise the human-like receptor, showed gradually increased hemagglutination (HA) acid stability and replication ability in human airway epithelial cells," they wrote in the paper.Further, they found that "human populations lack immunity to H3N2 CIVs, and even preexisting immunity derived from the present human seasonal influenza viruses cannot provide protection against H3N2 CIVs"."Our results showed that canines may be intermediates for adapting avian influenza viruses to humans. Continuous surveillance coordinated with risk assessment for CIVs is necessary," the researchers said.AdvertisementTo evaluate the infectivity and transmission ability of H3N2 CIVs in dogs, the team deliberately inoculated six dogs with the known dog flu strains.The dogs became mildly ill, with the most severe symptoms including fever, sneezing, wheezing, and coughing.While so far, there is no human infection reported with the H3N2 CIVs, the team cautioned that "dogs might increase the opportunity of viral cross-species transmission to humans".According to experts, the research highlights pet dogs' role as a possible "patient zero" for a future dog flu outbreak, The Telegraph reported.It is "pretty clear" the bird flu H3 strain has become a dog-specific virus, Prof James Wood, the head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge, was quoted as saying."The changes in the canine virus apparently are making it better adapted to transmit within mammals, as you might expect after such a long period in dogs," he noted.**The above article has been published from a wire source with minimal modifications to the headline and text.

Zimmerman, professor of family medicine in the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and professor of clinical epidemiology in the Department of Behavioral and Community Health Sciences at Pitt's School of Public Health, has worked with the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in a variety of roles for nearly 30 years. “I have always loved the intersection between science and health policy,” he said. “It is the way I’m wired. My initial goals as an ACIP liaison was to transmit the evidence-based family medicine perspective to the ACIP and to bring back to AAFP and (the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine) the latest vaccine science and policy.” After serving as the AAFP’s liaison to the committee, Zimmerman was asked by the CDC to become a voting member. In that role, he served as chair of the ACIP’s influenza and adult immunization working groups. He also has worked with the committee as a consultant. “The opportunity to assist with vaccine policy that affects care for our population is an incredible privilege,” he said. “It is a lot of work. I learned about disease epidemiology, vaccine science and public policy decision-making.” Zimmerman graduated from the Grant Family Medicine Residency in Columbus, Ohio, in 1989. Two years later, he finished a second residency in general preventive medicine and public health at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. That same year at the University of Minnesota, he completed a fellowship in academic medicine and clinical investigation and a master’s degree in public health. “I think that the U.S. health care system, and family medicine in particular, need to have training in health policy decision-making,” said Zimmerman, who served on the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Group, which serves a health system with 40 hospitals. “We also need adequate public health surveillance tools and strong informatics to analyze information quickly. We also need to study the public uptake of preventive measures and how we can facilitate that.” Zimmerman’s father, Willis Zimmerman, D.O., was a primary care physician in Toledo for 40 years and also served as chief of staff for a local hospital and director of a family medicine residency program. During his own residency at Grant, Zimmerman rotated with his father, who stressed immunizations in his practice. But the younger Zimmerman recalled a much earlier memory that raised his awareness of the importance of immunizations and vaccine-preventable diseases. His Sunday-school teacher, who also was family friend, developed paralytic polio as an adult. “Back in the days before handicap accessible facilities, he went on his crutches down the steps of an old church for my Eagle Scout banquet,” Zimmerman said. “He was quite a man, but he suffered greatly from post-polio syndrome.” As a student at the Ohio State College of Medicine, Zimmerman traveled to Africa for a rotation in Swaziland (now Eswatini). There he worked on a rural health survey regarding a mission clinic, and vaccines played a prominent role in that project. Nearly 40 years later, he’s still working on vaccine-related projects. Zimmerman was a leader in developing the Shots Immunizations App. That tool from the AAFP and STFM offers the latest guidance from the ACIP regarding adult and childhood immunization schedules. He led the University of Pittsburgh group that developed the 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program, which offers evidence-based, step-by-step guidance to improve immunization rates in outpatient settings. His published data regarding cost barriers to vaccinations has been used by the CDC to defend the Vaccines for Children program in Congress. Zimmerman has been the Pittsburgh lead for two CDC networks: The outpatient U.S. Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Network and its inpatient counterpart, the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network. The work of these networks directly contributed to the World Health Organization’s decision to change the influenza vaccine strain composition for the northern hemisphere in 2019. The networks also documented that live attenuated influenza vaccine was not effective against influenza type A, leading to the nasal spray’s temporary removal from the U.S. market in 2016. Those CDC Networks also have tracked COVID vaccine effectiveness data, which have been published and shared with the ACIP. “The most satisfying part of serving as an immunization expert during the pandemic was to use my expertise, training and experience to help others by formulating policy at the local level,” he said. “In my institutions, I provided clinician education on how policy is made and the care with which it is made, and provided education to the public on COVID, COVID vaccines and health policy.” Conversely, Zimmerman said the most challenging aspects of the pandemic were the speed of the virus’ spread and the vast amount of information that had to be digested. Clinicians faced vaccine hesitancy often based on false information or “alternative views on the truth” in a nation with limited health literacy, he said. Family physicians, however, can make a difference. “Changing beliefs is very difficult” he said. “I think that reasoned answers, compassion and direct messaging about the fact that the physician recommends the vaccine for this particular patient at this time is key, period. Also, physicians and their staff should be vaccinated to set the example.” Although his father was a primary care physician, Zimmerman said it was a fourth-year rotation in Mansfield, Ohio, that led him to choose family medicine. Family physicians Bill Geiger, M.D., and Terry Weston, M.D., invited Zimmerman not only into their practice, but also their homes. “These doctors practiced family medicine in a way that was holistic, accounting for the physical, psychological and spiritual concerns of their patients,” Zimmerman said. “This whole-person approach appealed to me, in contrast to some other approaches that would deal primarily with a particular body part.

Photo: Winson Wong“Under all these factors, it seems this outbreak may not be a large-scale one,” he added.Hui said an average influenza outbreak would peak in about four to six weeks, with the drop appearing from six to eight weeks. He noted, however, that more data was needed from the health department.Hong Kong marked the start of the flu season on April 6, with 103 people developing serious conditions and 49 dying, including a 17-year-old patient.AdvertisementStatistics from the Centre for Health Protection showed there were 47 severe flu cases between April 9 and 15, and 20 residents had died. Another 29 serious cases were logged between April 16 and 19, with 17 fatal.AdvertisementOle Akjær: Influenza | Exhibitions | MutualArt Log in Sign up 1 Month Free Personal Alerts View upcoming auction estimates and receive personalized email alerts for the artists you follow.

The exhibition marks the culmination of Aakjaer’s 6-month residency in New York City. The 60-day exhibition will be on view April 27th through June 25th, with an opening reception on Thursday, April 27th, from 6-8pm. Aakjaer, who has remained the gallery’s most sought after artist for 6 years, came to the United States with his family from Copenhagen in January of 2023, beginning a new body of work in the 22nd floor of his studio on Broadway, overlooking Canal street. Deeply inspired by the bustle of lower Manhattan, Aakajer took to the streets for inspiration. Tearing down and repurposing the wheatpaste posters and advertisements around Tribeca and the Lower East Side, Aakjaer brought elements of contemporary urban life and its gritty, ephemeral nature into his portraits of refined female subjects. Aakjaer, an astute observer of marketing and the world around him, found inspiration in the strong messaging and temporality of street art. It is the peoples’ art, existing on the fringes of the institutions that dominate the art market. By physically pulling off and reusing detritus from the streets, Ole’s work creates a dialog with unknown artists. To nourish this artistic exchange, stickers designed by the artist will be provided to all gallery visitors to place into the streets of New York, giving back to the streets.The show’s title alludes not to the virus but rather to the concept of transmission. Exploring the idea that we are an amalgam of the people, ideas, and stimuli with which we surround ourselves, Aakjaer is particularly influenced by the transference of artistic ideas from one artist to future generations of aspiring creators. Traditionally considering his figurative compositions as psychological self-portraits, these new paintings include portraits of the lauded artists (or their work) who have come before him and inspired his work, such as Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso, Frida Kahlo, Broken Fingaz, the comics of Japanese manga, Yue Minyun, Yoko Ono, Yoshimoto Nara, Leonardo Da Vinci, and others.

They also discussed its potential role in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. Primer: Immunological imprinting: Understanding COVID-19. Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock Immunological imprinting is a phenomenon where prior exposure to a viral strain (an antigen) elicits B-cell memory which confers protection against related antigens in the future. In other words, first exposure to an antigen (e.g., a viral pathogen) leaves an ever-lasting 'imprint' on the naïve immune system. Other names for immunological imprinting are antigenic imprinting, immune imprinting, and original antigenic sin (OAS). Renowned scientist Thomas Francis Jr coined the term OAS in the context of the influenza virus in the 1960s since many epidemiological studies associated immune imprinting with the effect of childhood exposure to the influenza A virus on susceptibility to contract severe influenza infections later in life. However, it has recently garnered attention due to the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The term original antigenic "sin" seems to have a negative connotation. It points to the development of a lifelong antigenic bias following the first exposure to an antigen in childhood. Although reactivity towards the original strain is higher than towards newer strains, it is yet feasible to exploit OAS with the right vaccine formulation. Further, the researchers discussed the seemingly conflicting observations in the published scientific literature on OAS, i.e., inherently focused on the influenza virus. In cases where OAS is examined as a bias in antibody levels after a second exposure to an antigen, the time of sampling after-re-exposure is a confounder. Further, 'biases' differs substantially, sometimes referring to a variation in antibody affinity to original vs. recall antigens or to a measurable variation in antibody titers, where quantification assays could be confounders (e.g., neutralization vs. binding assays). Though rarely, OAS also refers to in vivo antibody recall by a secondary antigen. However, these do not show quantifiable in vitro binding to the secondary antigen though they bind the original antigen. In the past few decades, connotations of the word 'sin' in OAS have limited its utility. So, avoiding this term and using other consistently defined terms that are less prone to misinterpretation is advised. Another noteworthy feature of immune imprinting is that all immunological reactivity differences triggered by it could not be translated into epidemiological differences. Hence, variable susceptibility to infections could easily be considered an 'epidemiological imprint' that the first antigen exposure leaves at the population level. Some additional terms could help explain or describe observed patterns in antibody titers or the above immunological effects of OAS. First is 'antigenic seniority,' which refers to a quantitatively stratified hierarchy of antibody titers elicited in response to encounters with antigenically-related viruses in a lifetime. Related StoriesThe long-term cardiac impact of COVID-19Study finds nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduces severe COVID-19 and long COVID risks in high-risk patientsCanada’s proactive policies reduce drug shortages far more effectively than the U.S.As the name suggests, in this hierarchy, antigens encountered earlier hold a senior position than those encountered later in life. Cross-sectional studies use this term in the context of 'steady-state' antibody titers, and while it captures a phenomenon closely similar to Francis' OAS, it has no negative connotations. Another term is 'back-boosting,' which refers to an elevation in antibody titers towards antigens encountered previously. Longitudinal studies used this term to describe antibody responses post-exposure to antigenically related pathogens, e.g., a modified influenza virus strain used in a vaccine or a newer strain causing re-infection. While the titer boost, i.e., fold-difference between pre-and post-exposure titers, is greater for newer antigens, back-boosting preserves the absolute neutralizing antibody titers towards previously encountered antigens at an elevated level than towards newer ones. These terms manifest two core immunological processes: cross-reactivity and memory recall. Published literature often suggests that immune imprinting is a barrier to generating protective immunity. For instance, there is evidence that childhood exposure adversely influenced the vaccine efficacy of influenza A viruses. On the contrary, childhood exposure to H1N1 substantially decreased the risk of H1N1-caused influenza and the risk of fatal H5N1 infection. However, given several mixed effects, beneficial and detrimental, of prior exposures, it is not advisable to generalize the effects of immune imprinting. While immunological data could help understand the observed epidemiological patterns, vice versa, i.e., extrapolating immunological results to clinical outcomes is not feasible. Considering the classic seroprotection curve, either of two possibilities arise: i) above an antibody threshold, the conferred immune protection does not increase; ii) comparable antibody titer fold variation could have markedly varying protective effects. Both scenarios depend on the actual antibody titers and their relationship with immune protection. Importantly, concerning disease severity, immune protection is multifactorial and not quantifiable by a single immunological assessment. So, while immunological data might be useful, interpreting the clinical and epidemiological inferences of exposure history entirely from variations in antibody reactivity patterns could lead to misinterpretations. So far, neutralizing antibodies are an established correlate of protection for COVID-19 vaccines. However, that does not undermine the significance of cellular immunity, which is relatively less affected by exposure history, when considering protection from disease. Studies have shown back-boosting of antibodies with cross-reactivity towards the spike(S) protein of several hCoVs following COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, evidence suggesting that these antibodies modulate susceptibility to severe disease is sparse. On the contrary, people primed with an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (Wuhan-Hu-1-like) via vaccination or infection, who contracted an infection with an antigenically drifted variant, showed higher neutralizing antibody titers against Wuhan-Hu-1-like antigen (by back-boosting) and the new infecting variant. However, when infected with an antigenically distant variant, e.g., Omicron, they maintained higher antibody titers against the Wuhan-Hu-1 than Omicron, illustrating antigenic seniority. Both scenarios are manifestations of recall of cross-reactive memory B cells elicited by Wuhan-Hu-1 priming. Surprisingly, bivalent vaccines based on Omicron BA.1/BA.5 antigens elicit a higher neutralization activity towards more antigenically advanced variants. Also, an Omicron antigen-based bivalent vaccine triggers antibodies with de novo reactivity toward mutated epitopes, indicating naïve B cell recruitment to the antigen exposure site. It is not yet possible to fully comprehend and generalize the effects of prior antigen exposure on subsequent B cells responses through cross-reactivity and recall. However, increasing antigen dosage or adding adjuvants in vaccine formulations could impede some of the limitations imposed by pre-existing memory. Conclusions Effects of prior antigen exposure impact immunity towards diseases. While immunological patterns, e.g., antigenic seniority, seemed significant in analyses of antibody reactivity, epidemiolocal patterns looked like the key determinants of disease susceptibility in people with varying exposure histories. Thus, there is an urgent need to carefully consider these effects using consistent terminology while extrapolating them to clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, the study provided insights that could greatly help the development of COVID-19 vaccines against antigenically progressive SARS-CoV-2 variants.

(Submitted by Dr. Nicole Jewett/Douglas Animal Hospital)With geese and other wild birds returning to the region every day, New Brunswick dog and cat owners should be aware of the risk of avian influenza, says the registrar of the New Brunswick Veterinary Medical Association.Dr. Nicole Jewett, a Fredericton-area vet, was commenting after the recent death of a dog in Ontario that had chewed on an infected wild goose."It's not something that we should panic over, but it's something that we should be aware and cautious of," she said."Certainly, any dead birds, you should keep your animals away from them."There have been about 80 cases of avian flu in New Brunswick — all in birds, both wild and commercially raised.A dead northern gannet washed up on a beach on the Acadian Peninsula on June 9, 2022. The Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative is monitoring flu cases in wild birds. (Shane Magee/CBC)The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is monitoring outbreaks in commercial flocks, Jewett said. That's where the greatest losses have been. Its website shows an estimated 7.5 million birds in flocks affected by highly pathogenic avian influenza as of April 19.So far in New Brunswick, commercial losses have been fairly low, noted Jewett. The food inspection agency reports two flocks affected with a total of fewer than 100 birds.People who keep chickens should keep their birds away from wild birds, said Jewett.Additionally, they should quarantine any new chickens they get for 30 days, she said, and avoid tracking manure from one farm to another on dirty boots.The Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative is monitoring cases in wild birds. Its website shows confirmed and suspected cases in geese, gulls, gannets, eagles, owls, hawks, crows and other species.Bird flu mainly spreads through waterfowl, but all types of birds can carry it, said Jewett. Transmission is generally through the bodily fluids of infected birds. Bird feces can pose a risk, too, in large quantities.Elizabeth Oley and Georgie, a two-year-old Morkie — a cross between a Maltese and a Yorkie. Oley said Georgie hasn't tried to go after rodents or birds. (Jennifer Sweet/CBC)The likelihood of a dog or cat getting bird flu is low, she said, "but it's there."Symptoms of avian flu in dogs and cats can include fever, low energy, redness around the eyes, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing, tremors, seizures and death, said Jewett.Besides birds, cases have also been found across the country in foxes, seals, dolphins, black bears, minks, raccoons and skunks, she said.The risk of pets catching it from wild animals is low because transmission requires sustained direct contact."The biggest thing would be to not feed your pets — dogs or cats — any raw meat from game birds or poultry, keeping cats indoors if possible, and dogs on a leash to protect them from accessing a potentially infected carcass."Pierina Rivas Robbiano, who was at the dog park with an 11-month-old shepherd mix named Rascal, said she doesn't let her dog chew on anything outside. (Jennifer Sweet/CBC)At a dog park in Fredericton on Tuesday, Elizabeth Oley said she hadn't heard about the dog death in Ontario and wasn't aware that bird flu could be a risk for Georgie, a two-year-old Morkie — a cross between a Maltese and a Yorkie. Despite Yorkshire terriers being historically bred for chasing rats, he hasn't tried to go after rodents or birds, she said, but she makes it a habit to try to avoid dead birds anyway, knowing they pose a risk of disease.Oley wondered, though, whether avian influenza is something Georgie could catch from other dogs at the dog park or from her adopted cat, who tends to sneak outside from time to time to hunt birds and mice.The risk of a dog or cat getting sick from another pet in the house or at the dog park is quite low, said Jewett, because the virus doesn't transfer easily between mammals.If your pet is infected, however, bird flu can look like a lot of other common ailments.Dog dies after contracting avian flu in OshawaSask. scientists developing vaccines to protect birds and humans from avian fluShe recommends going to a vet for an assessment if anything is off."Knowing that it happened in Ontario, that is really close," said Pierina Rivas Robbiano, who was at the park with Rascal, an 11-month-old shepherd mix.It's very sad and definitely a concern, she said.Knowing about it won't really change any of her habits, though. She doesn't let Rascal chew anything outside and, generally, his only contact with birds is chasing them until they fly away.ABOUT THE AUTHORJennifer SweetReporterJennifer Sweet has been telling the stories of New Brunswickers for over 20 years.

The East Atlantic Flyway links bird migration routes from the Arctic Circle to southern Africa via western Europe.“It’s migration season, so these outbreaks threaten birds and poultry all the way from Africa to Europe and the UK,” said Sacha Dench, founder of Conservation Without Borders and an ambassador for the UN’s Convention on Migratory Species, who saw more than 500 dead seabirds at two sites last week at the Tanji bird reserve.“The local conservation organisation [Wabsa] is expected to respond yet can’t even afford the £24 boat fuel to go to Bijol Islands,” Dench said. “The cost of it spreading is so much more than simply surveillance and control by good field workers.”Many low- to-middle-income countries have limited conservation funds, she added. “Most rely on international funding and some money from tourism to pay for the services of local park staff. But when an emergency like bird flu hits, the government has priorities like chicken being important protein for local people.“Rapid reaction is critical. So having staff on the ground with the resources that enable them to act is essential,” said Dench, who secured temporary funds for the boat fuel. She has written to ask the UK government to help fund the surveillance and disposal of infected birds, a critical matter for the government at a time when the UK’s bird flu restrictions on free-range poultry are only just being lifted.Death of thousands of wild birds from avian flu is ‘new Silent Spring’Read more“Investing in monitoring activities in developing countries would save a lot of birds we love, and could save [the poultry farming] industry a lot of money,” said Dench, who hopes that other national governments could also support the Gambia’s avian flu recovery efforts. “This is more than conservation, this is management of a global pandemic, and we should at least be offering assistance to those with less resources on the migration flyways that the UK sits right at the centre of.”Fagimba Camara, head of the research unit at Wabsa, who has been monitoring the Bijol Islands and digging holes in the sand to bury dead birds, says that minimising spread of infection is a “big task”.“This is the most important place for migratory species in the Gambia because we record so many in large numbers, including royal terns, Caspian terns, ruddy turnstones and osprey, which fly from Scotland and other parts of Europe for their wintering time.” At the beginning of the month, Camara found 246 dead birds. This week, his team found 107, mainly royal terns. “At least we are seeing the number of affected birds decreasing [on Bijol Islands],” he said, although numbers are increasing elsewhere in the Gambia.Awa Joof, research officer for Wabsa, said: “The most difficult thing to do is dig bird graves, so it is definitely so sad for me to see birds dying in such large numbers.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe age of extinctionBirdsBird fluChickenThe GambiaHealthWildlifenewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It has since established itself in canines and evolved to become a mammalian-adapted form of bird flu.Bird flu is highly contagious and deadly among birds, but has never been shown to sustain transmission from person to person.But scientists have long been concerned that if the avian influenza virus was able to establish itself in a mammal species, then it might go on to morph into a strain that can pass from mammal to mammal, including humans.A study from bird flu specialists at the China Agricultural University analysed swabs from more than 4,000 dogs. It found the virus is now showing signs of being better able to recognise human cell receptors, as well as a heightened ability to replicate in human cells.The team said dogs could be the stepping stone species bridging the significant anatomical gap between birds and people.“Our results showed that canines may serve as intermediates for the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to humans,” the scientists wrote in their paper, published in the journal eLife.Six dogs were deliberately infected with each of the six known dog flu strains of H3N2 in a lab and all were found to be only mildly unwell. The most severe symptoms were a fever, sneezing and coughing.British experts said the study is well conducted and offers insight into the role pet dogs may play as a potential patient zero for a future “dog flu” outbreak.‘Bird flu H3 strain has evolved’Prof James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge, told The Telegraph “it is pretty clear” the bird flu H3 strain has now evolved into a dog-specific virus.“The changes in the canine virus apparently are making it better adapted to transmit within mammals, as you might expect after such a long period in dogs,” he said.He added that this could be good news for the potential zoonotic infection of people as it has so far not spilled over into humans, but warned this could be because it has not yet reached the required mutation threshold.“The virus does not seem to pose particularly worrying health threats to dogs - one might be more concerned about the longer term pandemic potential in other species such as humans,” said Prof Wood.Prof Ian Jones, professor of virology at the University of Reading, told The Telegraph that the Chinese study provides evidence the virus is “creeping” towards being human-like.“It’s a data-rich paper that surely shows that the most recent viruses (clade 5) are more adapted to mammals than was the original virus that made the leap from an avian,” he said.“But some of this is just the virus settling down in the dog, so inevitably becoming mammalian virus-like.“At the moment I judge this data warrants attention but that the case for a ‘threat’ is not clear.” Avian influenza is highly contagious and deadly among birds but has never been shown to sustain transmission from person to person Credit: PA Prof Jones also said it was possible, with its array of current mutations, that the dog flu virus could go on to infect humans. There is as yet no evidence of this, or reported cases of this happening.People lack immunity to the H3 family of influenza viruses, the study authors warned, saying antibodies from pre-existing flu jabs and influenza strains would not work against dog flu.Prof Jones said this seems unlikely and that there may be some pre-existing protection against disease, even if not against infection, as was seen during the Covid pandemic.The study only looked at the presence of dog flu in canines living in China, but Prof Wood said if throat swabs were taken from other dogs around the world, then he would expect it to be present globally.“Other canine viruses have spread globally and it seems likely that this one may well have already done so too,” he said. “So I don’t believe that screening for any dogs moving from the US, China or elsewhere would be proportionate based on the evidence in the paper.” ‘Enhanced surveillance necessary’Both the authors and the independent scientists said it is too soon to bring in any restrictions on human-dog dyads, but said enhanced surveillance and testing would be a prudent move.“Continuous surveillance coordinated with risk assessment for canine influenza viruses is necessary,” the Chinese scientists wrote in their paper.Prof Jones said screening, quarantine and regular dog flu testing is not yet warranted by the threat revealed by the new paper.However, he said: “It would be no bad thing if rapid tests for dog influenza were in time added to other current diagnostics.“In some countries dog control would be impossible and in others socially difficult, think of bovine TB and badgers in the UK.“I think the obvious thing is surveillance and an awareness in influenza reference centres of the dog adapted sequences so any human cases can be reported quickly.” Join the conversation Show comments The Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Thousands of birds have already been found dead, raising concerns for the tens of millions of birds that pass through these African countries every year on the East Atlantic Flyway migratory route.Â An avian influenza outbreak has been detected in the West African nations of Senegal and The Gambia. Caused by the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu, conservationists working in the area are now worried that without more funding to contain the virus it will spread further amongst the millions of birds that move through the region as they migrate between southern Africa and northern Europe.Â Â Â Â Already, reports from Senegal suggest that at least 1,552 dead wild birds have been found, while in The Gambia at least 500 dead seabirds have been recorded at Tanji Bird Reserve. The birds found dead have reportedly included great white pelicans, great cormorants, grey-headed gulls, royal terns and the West African crested tern. In addition to this, hundreds of cases of bird flu have been found in poultry, which has led to the culling of tens of thousands of chickens. Teams of conservationists in Senegal and The Gambia have been trying to tackle the outbreak in a bid to contain its spread. Their efforts have included collecting as many dead wild birds as possible and burying them. But there is a fear that because the wetlands and coastal marshes where the infected birds have been found are on migratory routes, it might lead to further outbreaks in Europe. The wetlands of Westen Africa are hugely significant for large numbers of wading and shorebirds, such as terns and gullsÂ Â©Allan Hopkins/Flickr CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Sacha Dench is the founder of the charity Conservation Without Borders who have been working to contain the outbreak in The Gambia. She told the Guardian, 'It's migration season, so these outbreaks threaten birds and poultry all the way from Africa to Europe and the UK.' Â 'Rapid reaction is critical. So having staff on the ground with the resources that enable them to act is essential. Investing in monitoring activities in developing countries would save a lot of birds we love, and could save [the poultry farming] industry a lot of money.' What is the East Atlantic Flyway? The East Atlantic Flyway is one of eight major migratory routes used by birds, such as waders and shorebirds, to move around the world between breeding and wintering grounds. It connects northern Europe both to North America in the east but also to the warmer climes of Africa to the south, with the southern route tracing the Atlantic coastline of Africa from Morocco all the way down to South Africa. It is estimated that some 90 million birds use the flyway going in both directions. As the birds make their epic migrations, they frequently stop off at wetlands and marshes along the way to replenish their energy and take in the sights. This means that to conserve migratory birds, their habitat needs to be protected right along this migratory corridor so they always have enough places to feed and rest. But it also means that the flyway can become a significant highway for highly transmissible diseases, such as the current bird flu outbreak. This isn't the first time that this has occurred, with an upsurge of avian influenza in the early 2000s also spreading along this route, while in 2022 there was confirmation that birds infected with a European strain of the virus were carrying it into North America.Â The bird flu pandemic has already swept through many colonies of nesting seabirds in northern Europe, with European gannets particularly hard hitÂ Â©LouieLea/Shutterstock A global spread The reports coming from West Africa are simply the latest in a string of bird flu outbreaks that have been spreading around the world during the past year, from the seabird colonies of Scotland to the coasts of Peru. It is estimated that some 200 million birds have died as a result of the bird flu pandemic.Â While this is clearly devastating for the wild populations of birds, there are also some concerns that it could also threaten human health. The virus has already been observed jumping into mammalian hosts, causing the deaths of thousands of sealions in South America, but to date there have only been a few cases reported in people. 'This is more than conservation, this is management of a global pandemic,' says Sacha.

U.S. Bird Flu Dogs Virus China Flu Dogs Could Be "Patient Zero" For Virus With Potential To Infect Humans Published Apr 25, 2023 at 5:18 PM EDT Updated Apr 26, 2023 at 11:33 AM EDT By Anna Skinner Senior Writer, General AssignmentFOLLOW Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! A bird flu virus that has spread to canines may hop hosts in the future, potentially infecting humans through their pet dogs, according to scientists at China Agricultural University.Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic gained steam in 2020, more Americans have turned their eyes to the pathology and the origin of viruses, as well as methods to fight infection through vaccines and prevention. Although no dog-to-human infection of the H3N2 avian flu have been detected, the virus is evolving to exhibit new properties that show its potential of infecting other mammals in the future, such as humans.The scientists published their study in the science journal eLife on April 11. The findings revealed that the virus infecting dogs is descended from H3N2, a type of avian flu. The virus first began affecting dogs nearly 20 years ago in China. It spread to American dogs by 2015. The virus causes mild respiratory symptoms in dogs, such as sneezing, coughing and lethargy. The mortality rate is low, according to VCA Animal Hospitals. Image of dog with inset of Influenza virus. A new study by China Agricultural University scientists shows that the H3N2 canine flu may evolve in the future, potentially infecting humans. Image of dog with inset of Influenza virus. A new study by China Agricultural University scientists shows that the H3N2 canine flu may evolve in the future, potentially infecting humans. Korneeva_Kristina/Getty; Dr_Microbe/Getty There was no proof of the virus spreading to humans from dogs, but experts believe the virus could mutate further if it continues to become established in dogs. The Independent reported that British scientists interpreted the study as revealing that dogs could be "patient zero" for the virus's evolution. According to Professor James Wood, who heads the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge, H3N2 seems to have become a dog-specific virus."The changes in the canine virus apparently are making it better adapted to transmit within mammals, as you might expect after such a long period in dogs," Wood said in the article.China Agricultural University's research shows the virus could continue to evolve, making other mammals suitable hosts.Newsweek reached out to China Agricultural University by email for comment.By studying tracheal cells from sick dogs ranging from 2012 to 2019, scientists learned that the H3N2 canine influenza virus has evolved to gain new phenotypic properties over the last 11 years. The phenotypic properties show the virus is improving its adaptation to mammals over a period of several years. Scientists also studied how the viruses react when infecting human cells.

Despite the lack of evidence that the virus impacts humans from their pet dogs, the research could give scientists a head start with potential cures or prevention methods to manage the virus.However, Dr. Rebecca Wilkes, head of the Molecular and Virology Section of the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at the Purdue University, told Newsweek that the virus has a very low risk of causing a pandemic in the human population.A spokesperson for the CDC echoed the sentiment."In general, canine influenza viruses are thought to pose a low threat to people. To date, there is no evidence of spread of canine influenza viruses from dogs to people and there has not been a single reported case of human infection with a canine influenza virus in the U.S. or worldwide," the spokesperson told Newsweek.Update 04/26/23 11:33 a.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from Dr. Rebecca Wilkes.

The numbers of severe patients and deaths remain flat, and the use rate of beds is at a low level nationwide. Reference: Local trend * The number of new cases of infection is an approximate figure per 100,000 of the population, as the total for the current week, which is the reported number in HER-SYS as of Apr. 18 at 00:00 AM (the same time point is used for the ratio to the previous week), and the use rate of beds is the secured bed use rate as of the time of the announcement on Apr. 14. <Changes in the number of new cases of infection and comparison to the previous week (nationwide) > Infection status and future outlook Infection status The number of new cases of infection has gradually been increasing after a nationwide halt. On the other hand, the level continues to be lower than before the spread of infection in the summer last year (2022). Regarding the number of new cases of infection by region, in Hokkaido, the Hokuriku-Koshinetsu region, and Okinawa, the number per population is higher than the national average. Meanwhile, in the Tokai, Shikoku, and Kyushu regions, the number is lower than the average. In addition, the number of cases of mass infection in facilities for elderly people and medical institutions has leveled off. Seen by age group, the number of new cases of infection has recently increased in teens and younger people nationwide, although the number has also increased in people in their 20s in some large cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. The numbers of severe patients and deaths remain flat nationwide. With the spread of infection this winter, the proportion of elderly patients in their 80s and older among newly infected patients tended to increase, compared to that during the spread of infection in the summer last year (2022). As the reports of deaths among children since January 2022 suggest, attention must be paid to the occurrence of severe cases and deaths as well as the number of hospitalized children associated with an increase in the number of infected children. Regarding seasonal influenza, at the time of the announcement last weekend, the weekly number of reports per fixed-point medical institution was decreasing nationwide, and is far below the advisory level. Future outlook Attention should be paid to the future infection status because the number of new cases of infection may remain flat or continue to show a gradually increasing trend nationwide, although it may differ among regions. It is also necessary to pay attention to the future impact of increased opportunities for contact, the attenuation of immunity, and an increase in the proportion of strains that can escape the immune system, on the infection status. In light of the situation the past 2 years, it is considered that the infection will spread after the consecutive holidays in May, that it will decrease once and then spread again in the summer. Although seasonal influenza is still at the advisory level in some regions, it is expected to decrease further based on past trends. Factors that increase and suppress infection [Immunity as a result of vaccination and infection] With the promotion of vaccination and natural infection, it is considered that the proportion of immune carriers against the Omicron variant (BA.5 and BQ1.1), which has shown an increase in each age group, will decrease over time in the future. [Contact status] There are many regions where the nighttime population is currently decreasing compared to the level at the start of the new fiscal year. In the future, however, opportunities for contact is expected to increase due to the consecutive holidays in May. [Epidemic strain] In Japan, the BA.5 lineage, including the BQ.1 lineage, was mainstream, but its proportion has tended to decrease since around March. On the other hand, the proportions of the XBB.1.5 lineage, which is frequently reported in the United States, the XBB.1.9 lineage, which is frequently reported in Europe, and the XBB lineage including the XBB.1.16 lineage, which is frequently reported in India, are on the rise. Since the number of registered variant strains is decreasing as the number of infected people in Japan decreases, caution is required when considering the proportion of variant strains. [Climate/Seasonal Factors] With the temperature rising now, the climate conditions will facilitate ventilation. It is thought that a reduction of the amount of time spent indoors has a certain effect on suppressing infection; however, it should be noted that the infection may spread during this period. Situation of the medical care provision system The use rate of beds is at a low level below 10% in most regions. The use rate of beds for severe patients is also low nationwide. The number of patients receiving treatment in nursing care facilities has continued to decrease. Regarding emergency medical care, the number of cases where emergency transportation is difficult remains flat nationwide, but attention should continuously be paid to the future trend of the number of cases where emergency transportation is difficult and securing of a system to provide emergency medical care. Measures to be taken Basic concepts Unless we face special circumstances such as the emergence of a variant with a pathogenicity greatly different from that of the Omicron variant, COVID-19 shall be positioned as a Class V Infectious Disease instead of a Novel Influenza Infection, etc. under the Infectious Disease Act from May 8 this year (2023). In association with this, the government decided on March 10 this year to make necessary revisions to various policies and measures that have been taken, such as the medical care system, response to facilities for the elderly, and public financial support for patients. Meanwhile, it is necessary to continue efforts to strengthen and focus the healthcare system to provide appropriate medical care for elderly people and those at high risk of aggravation, even with limited medical resources. Each citizen will be asked to take voluntary actions to prevent infection to protect those at high risk of aggravation, such as elderly people, and to ensure regular medical care. 1. Further promotion of vaccination As for the “vaccine for the Omicron variant," vaccination of all persons aged 5 and older who have completed the first vaccination should proceed. All eligible persons who wish to receive vaccination will be encouraged to receive the vaccine for the Omicron variant. Those who have not received vaccination will be encouraged to consider getting the initial vaccination as soon as possible. For children (aged 5 to 11 years), the initial vaccination and additional vaccination with the vaccine for the Omicron variant will be promoted. For children (aged 6 months to 4 years), the initial vaccination will be promoted. Vaccination in FY 2023 will be promoted (vaccination will be given to all eligible persons aged 5 years and older in autumn and winter, and vaccination will be given to elderly people and those at high risk of aggravation in spring and summer, without waiting until autumn or winter). 2. Use of tests The national and local governments are required to secure a system that enables testing, and should utilize testing. Perform frequent tests (about 2 or 3 times a week for facility workers) for workers at facilities for elderly people. Promote the establishment of a system for fever outpatients, whereby patients with symptoms can self-test using an antigen qualitative test kit, and if the result is positive, they can promptly undergo health observation at a health follow-up center, etc. Promote the utilization of antigen qualitative test kits, which have been switched to OTC and are sold on the Internet. 3. Effective ventilation It is necessary to publicize and recommend effective indoor ventilation methods (such as how to create airflow considering aerosols, the installation of partitions that do not block airflow, etc.). 4. Securing a medical care provision system With support of the national government, local governments continue to take measures to avoid overcrowding of hospital beds, fever clinics, etc. Make appropriate adjustments so that patients who need hospital treatment can be hospitalized preferentially (securing and expanding logistical support hospitals, and improving the hospital turnover rate, such as by dissemination of the standard for early discharge of 4 days, as a rule). Implement frequent examinations at facilities for elderly people and others. Further strengthen medical support during normal times. Local residents should be informed that they should refrain from visiting emergency outpatient units only to receive a precautionary examination if they do not have symptoms, for example, taking the actual situation in the region into consideration, so that nobody is prevented from receiving treatment. To respond to concerns and questions when a patient’s physical condition deteriorates, the telephone consultation service by healthcare professionals should be thoroughly publicized, and this service should also be strengthened. In response to the government's decision on March 10 this year, with the change in positioning as a Class V Infectious Disease, encourage medical facilities that have been responding to the new coronavirus infection to continue to respond, and start efforts to encourage new medical facilities to participate. Maintenance and expansion of responding medical institutions through review of infection control measures, support for maintenance of facilities, clarification of the obligation to provide treatment, and dissemination of easy-to-understand educational materials on infection control and medical treatment policies In each prefecture, until the expansion of infection in the next winter a transition plan up to the end of September will be formulated in April, with contents such as the acceptance of patients with mild disease by new medical institutions, and the coordination of hospitalization among medical institutions. 5. Response to simultaneous epidemics of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza The following efforts should be promoted according to the actual situation in each region: fever outpatient clinics, telephone consultationselemedicine, health follow-up centers, self-test kits, consultation system, and emergency medical care. Smooth supply of medications including oral drugs prescribed after confirmation of the indication by physicians will be promoted. Pharmacies, etc. will be asked to use the consultation service of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare regarding antipyretic analgesics, etc. The prefectures will work to strengthen and prioritize the health care system based on plans to establish systems such as strengthening of outpatient medical care systems in accordance with the actual conditions in each region. It is necessary to provide information and send appropriate messages to the public depending on the infection status. People at low risk of aggravation will be encouraged to use a self-test kit or local follow-up center. People will be advised to do the following: check the “guide for ambulance services” in preparation for an acute illness or injury, consult a family doctor when hesitant to call an ambulance, use a telephone consultation service such as #7119, and call an ambulance without hesitation if necessary. 6. Surveillance and risk assessment, etc. After the position of COVID-19 under the Infectious Disease Act is changed on May 8 this year (2023), preparations will be made in cooperation with local governments to perform a stratified analysis through continued seroepidemiologic surveys, sewage surveillance studies, etc. to grasp and publish data such as the numbers of infected patients, hospitalized patients, and deaths. Monitoring of the trends of variant strains will also be continued through genome surveillance. Regarding the risk assessment of COVID-19, it is necessary to continue evaluation of the pathogenicity, infectivity, mutations, etc. 7. Quarantine measures Regarding temporary measures for people entering from China after December 30th last year, sample tests at entry which have been conducted for some people entering Japan since March 1 this year will be continued. From April 5th this year, instead of submission of a negative certificate, those who enter from China by mainland flight will be required to submit either a negative certificate or a certificate of vaccination (three times), considering the situation of infections in Japan and overseas, knowledge obtained through temporary measures, and the status of quarantine measures in G7 countries. Along with the end of quarantine measures scheduled for May 8 this year (2023), Infection Genome Surveillance (provisional name) will start on the same day to monitor the influx of new infectious diseases, even in ordinary times. 8. Re-inspection and implementation of basic infection control measures Everyone must take the following basic precautions from the perspective of being aware of the epidemic of infectious disease in the community, protecting ourselves from infectious disease, and protecting people close to us as well as society from infectious disease, especially the elderly. If feeling unwell or having symptoms, do not overdo it, and be treated at home or see a doctor. Hand hygiene such as hand washing as a daily habit Wearing a mask and practicing cough etiquette according to the situation Understanding and practicing lifestyle habits such as moderate exercise and diet Enforcement of ventilation, and avoiding crowded places, close contact, and closed spaces (the 3 Cs) Make efforts such as promoting the use of telework in the workplace. From May 8 this year, the government will not uniformly request the use of basic infection control measures but will respect the independent choice of individuals and leave it to their judgment. Concerning the period of home care for people who test positive, they should monitor their own physical condition by such means as checking their body temperature and take thorough infection control measures when going out. They are also requested to avoid contact with people who are at risk of severe disease, such as elderly people. From May 8 this year (2023), it will be recommended that they refrain from going out for 5 days after the onset of disease and 24 hours after the alleviation of symptoms. It will also be recommended that they wear a mask and avoid contact with high-risk people until 10 days have passed from then. To allow the minimum necessary outings, such as shopping for groceries, after 24 hours have passed since symptoms have subsided or when there are no symptoms, it is necessary to take voluntary actions to prevent infection, such as wearing a mask when going out, keeping contact with other people at the minimum period of time possible, and not using public transportation. << Reference: Findings on the characteristics of the Omicron variant and its sublineages >> [Infectivityransmissibility] It has been confirmed that compared to the Delta variant, the generation time has shortened to approximately 2 days (approximately 5 days for Delta). The doubling time and incubation period have also shortened, the risk of re-infection and secondary infection after infection has increased, and the speed of infection spread is very fast. According to the reported data, pre-symptomatic transmission has probably occurred to some extent as with the previous strains. [Placeoute of infection] In Japan, many cases of infection have occurred through the same opportunities as before (spending time indoors in locations with inadequate ventilation, eating and drinking, etc.), and infection is also considered to have occurred via droplets adhering to mucosa, aerosol inhalation, contact infection, etc. [Severity, etc.] It has been shown that infection with the Omicron variant may present a relatively lower risk of hospitalization or aggravation than with the Delta variant. To evaluate COVID-19, including the Omicron variant, it is necessary to assess not only the severity as a disease but also the transmissibility and the impact on medical care and society. Concerning the death toll during the spread of infection from the end of 2021, it has been reported that COVID-19 was not the direct cause of death in quite a number of cases, compared to that during the spread of infection in the summer of 2021; for example, there were deaths due to the worsening of underlying diseases after infection with the novel coronavirus in elderly people who had been living in a facility for elderly people since before the infection. There were many cases of serious respiratory failure due to typical viral pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus infection from the beginning of the novel coronavirus outbreak until the Delta variant epidemic. However, during the Omicron variant epidemic, it was reported that other diseases than pneumonia became the main cause of death, such as the exacerbation of underlying disease that had been present before hospitalization and the onset of other complications during hospitalization. During the spread of infection last summer, a decrease in the rate of severe cases and an increase in the proportion of elderly people among hospitalized patients were seen, as had been seen previously, compared to the spread of infection in the summer of 2021. In addition, compared to the situation during the spread of infection since the end of 2021, the rates of mechanical ventilationasal high flow use and steroid prescription among the number of deaths associated with the spread of infection was lower during the summer of 2022. Among the fatal cases of infected children who died of endogenous factors, there were some cases without any underlying diseases. Reports on the results of on-site investigations have stated that it is necessary to pay attention to neurological symptoms such as convulsions and disturbance of consciousness as well as systemic symptoms such as vomiting and poor oral intake besides respiratory symptoms. Among the deaths that occurred at home in July and August last year, approximately 80% of the patients were 70 years and older, which is similar to the trend of all deaths during the same period. It suggests that there were also many deaths caused by factors other than COVID-19. Regarding the situation of handling known coronavirus-positive corpses, the number of cases reported monthly was the highest in December last year (2022). The proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 was approximately 30% of all deaths. [Virus shedding period] Japanese data suggest that infectious viruses are expelled in the period from 2 days before the onset of symptoms to 7-10 days after the onset, and that the mean amount of expelled infectious viruses is very high in the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms and greatly decreases to one-twentieth to one-fiftieth the amount on the day of onset after 5 days have passed, approaching the detection limit, although there are individual differences. [Vaccine effects] Concerning conventional vaccines, the infection and disease onset prevention effects of the first vaccination against the Omicron variant have been markedly reduced. The hospitalization-preventing effect is reported maintained at a certain level for the first 6 months, but subsequently decreases to 50% or less. On the other hand, it has been reported overseas that a third vaccination restores the infection-preventing, disease onset-preventing and hospitalization-preventing effects against infection with the Omicron variant, and information on how these vaccine effects are attenuated after a third vaccination has become available. Concerning the vaccine for the Omicron variant (BA.4-5), it has been reported that the preventive effect against disease onset was observed within 0 to 2 months (median 1 month) after vaccination. [Sublineages of the Omicron variant] The proportion of the BA.5 lineage, which was the mainstream worldwide, is declining, and on the other hand, the proportion of the XBB lineage (a recombinant of the BJ.1 lineage [a sublineage of the BA.2.10 lineage] and the BM.1.1.1 lineage [a sublineage of the BA.2.75.3 lineage]), including the XBB.1.5 lineage, is increasing currently. The proportion of the XBB.1.5 lineage, the XBB.1.9 lineage, and the XBB.1.16 lineage (all of them include sublineages) is increasing in the United States, Europe, and India, respectively. The severity of disease caused by the XBB.1.5 lineage is not higher than that caused by the BQ.1 lineage, but its clinical picture and epidemiological findings are otherwise insufficient. The clinical picture and epidemiological findings are also insufficient regarding the XBB.1.9 lineage and the XBB.1.16 lineage. It is therefore necessary to continue collecting and analyzing data on overseas situations and to continue monitoring through genome surveillance. Caution should be exercised when considering the proportion of variant strains because the number of registered variant strains is decreasing as the number of infected people decreases worldwide.

It is critical, too, that community engagement and equity are the centre of our efforts, especially for those populations that are marginalised and most at risk.”While the current focus of PRET will be on respiratory viruses — in the backdrop of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, possible threat of an avian influenza outbreak — work is already underway to assess what should be the next group of pathogens to be mitigated under this initiative. The initiative was announced at the Global Meeting for Future Respiratory Pathogen Pandemics held on 24-26 April 2023 in Geneva, Switzerland.The PRET monitoring framework, which is expected to be outlined soon, lists a host of actions which countries will be expected to work on with progress being achieved by December 2025. The three-pronged approach includes updating preparedness plans that affirm priority actions, increase connectivity among stakeholders in pandemic preparedness planning through systematic coordination and cooperation and dedicate sustained investments, financing and monitoring of pandemic preparedness with a special focus on bridging the lacunes highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. “The PRET Initiative ushers in a new era for pandemic preparedness and represents an evolution of WHO’s core activities to support all member states in strengthening health emergency preparedness, prevention, and response capacities and capabilities. The initiative can also serve to operationalize the objectives and provisions of the Pandemic Accord, which is currently being negotiated by WHO Member States,” the global health body noted. Discussions are also underway to make amendments to the International Health Regulations with the Working Group wrapping up its third meeting last week. Amendments related to amendments related to compliance, implementation, and public health response were discussed in the closed-door meetings.WorldHealthInfectious Diseasescovid-19Respiratory DiseasesThe World Health OrganizationpandemicDiseasesOutbreakpandemic preparednessShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

Photo by Jan Temmel from Pixabay An outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu has been confirmed in pheasants in Powys. The Welsh government has confirmed the virus was identified in pheasants at a farm near Newtown and all the bird affected will be culled. The latest outbreak is the second to be detected in Wales since the Welsh Government lifted the housing order for poultry and captive birds on April 18. Avian flu was also confirmed at a commercial poultry farm in Powys on April 23rd. Chief Veterinary Officer for Wales, Richard Irvine said: “Rigorous and scrupulous hygiene and biosecurity measures offer the best protection for kept birds against avian influenza. Whether keepers have a few birds or a thousand, it is vital the very highest standards of biosecurity are maintained. “Vigilance is also key, and it’s important any signs or suspicion of avian influenza is reported immediately. “I want to thank bird keepers across Wales for their continued efforts to keep their flocks safe.” Avian flu is currently at the highest level recorded across the UK and Europe – with over 330 cases confirmed across the UK and 15 in Wales since October 2021. Over half of the cases recorded in Wales have been in Powys. Poultry farms have been hit particularly hard, with approximately four million farm birds culled. Prevention Zone The Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ), which covers all of Wales and was introduced last October, remains in place. This requires keepers of poultry and other captive birds to take appropriate and practicable steps to prevent avian influenza, including: Keeping kept birds off land that is known to be, or at high risk of being, frequented by wild waterfowl, or contaminated by their droppings or feathers. Ensure the areas where birds are kept are unattractive to wild birds, especially waterfowl, for example, by netting ponds and surrounding areas and by removing wild bird food sources; Feed and water birds in enclosed areas to discourage wild birds; Minimise movement of people in and out of bird enclosures; Clean and disinfect footwear, use foot dips before entering poultry enclosures, and keep areas where birds live clean and tidy; Ensure all bedding, equipment, clothing and anything else that enters the areas where birds are kept are free of direct or indirect contamination with HPAI, which is mainly spread through bird droppings. Keep domestic ducks and geese separate from other poultry. Findings of dead wild birds should continue to be reported to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77 and keepers should continue to promptly report suspicion of disease in their birds to APHA on 0300 303 8268.

(Photo: Samoa Observer) By Talaia Mika • 24 April 2023, 11:10AM The Acting Director General for the Ministry of Health, Dr. Atoa Glenn Fatupaito has urged members of the public to take preventative measure for the flu outbreak as the virus can be deadly. In an interview with the Samoa Observer, Dr. Fatpaito said it is more severe than the normal flu and the number of infected people with pre-existing conditions keeps growing. "It may seem like a normal flu hence many will disregard the seriousness of the flu," he said. "We are more worried about the wellbeing of our children as they are the most affected by the virus so it's important that we have our children vaccinated for measles, mumps, and rubella." Dr. Fatupaito also acknowledged the work of the nurses who have been conducting outreach surveillance programs in villages for the M.M.R vaccination for children. While government and private schools are currently on a two weeks holiday, the Ministry are conducting outreaches to villages where MMR vaccination is low with the appeal to the public to ensure that all children are fully vaccinated. Since December last year, the Ministry recorded an increase in Influenza-like illness in Samoa with total cases exceeding 800 cases in mid-December and close to 500 cases towards Christmas. A Syndromic Surveillance Report produced on the 26th of December 2022 stated that that a total of 865 cases were reported between 12–18 December 2022 and 490 between 19–25 December 2022. Meanwhile, the Ministry last week confirmed that the main virus circulating in the community is Influenza (flu) B which has symptoms similar to the COVID-19 virus. A statement released on Friday afternoon confirmed that there continues to be a steady increase of influenza-like-illness or 'flu' reported at health facilities since 5 April 2023. According to the syndromic surveillance data from M.O.H. released on Friday, a total of 1,764 cases of Influenza-like illness have been reported to all health facilities in Samoa from 10-16 April 2023. "Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus and is contagious," the statement from M.O.H. stated. Influenza can cause illness which becomes severe and sometimes leads to hospitalisation and death. "There are four types of Influenza (flu) which are type A, B, C,D. The most common type are A and B- with both confirmed to be circulating in Samoa. Type A influenza is the most common and can be more serious in adults. Type B is confirmed to be more common in children and is more serious in the same young age group. "Both influenza type A and B have the potential to be severe in patients who contract these viruses. Symptoms for influenza b flu are similar to COVID-19 and include fever, headache, muscle ache, and upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing and coughing. Many patients also report a loss of smell and taste. "Influenza spreads through inhaling droplets from the cough or sneeze of an infected person. Some people may not have any symptoms at all but could still spread the virus (contagious)." Furthermore, the statement also urged the general public in taking precautionary methods as advised to minimise the spread of the virus in the community. "As of today, the Ministry received laboratory confirmation confirming Influenza-B as the main virus circulating in the community. As such, the Ministry of Health wishes to strongly advise the general public in taking heed of the notice below and to continue with precautionary methods as advised to greatly minimize the spread of the Influenza B virus or 'flu'."

Avian Influenza, also known as bird flu, has killed about 3.4 million birds across the country and is currently spreading in various poultries nationwide, the Federal Government announced on Thursday. It, however, stated it would adopt the “no vaccination” policy in tackling the disease, despite the widespread attacks of bird flu nationwide. The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mahmood Abubakar, stated this at a briefing in Abuja. He explained that the “no vaccination” decision came after due consideration of scientific and socio-economic evidence. He said the pieces of evidence were available to the ministerial committee on the merits and demerits of vaccination or no vaccination, adding that the decision was based on best global practices as well as the recommendations of the World Organisation for Animal Health. “The committee recommended that the country should stick to the ‘No Vaccination’ policy for now. The committee noted that the country might want to change the policy to vaccinate against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in future, but recommended some activities to be carried out before considering the option of vaccination against HPAI as a policy for the country. “So the status-quo on vaccination policy against HPAI in Nigeria thus remains and as such, ‘No vaccination’ against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza’ in Nigeria for now,” Abubakar stated.

He, however, stated that from 2017 till date, Nigeria had witnessed 476 outbreaks, with about 3.4 million birds lost as a result of the outbreak “Indirectly, we have been having pressure to go into vaccination, one of the disadvantages is that if you are not properly regulated, if you don’t know the exit route and jump into it, you are jumping into confusion. “We have seen that in some countries that went into vaccination during the outbreak in Africa and Asia, they are still battling with the disease,” he stated. On the advantages of ‘no vaccination’, Vakuru said “If we are able to control the disease, we are demonstrating again that our surveillance system could be vibrant and up to the task of containing the disease and most likely other diseases that might encroach into the country.” Okechukwu Nnodim Okechukwu, a journalist with Punch Newspapers, has 15 years experience covering Energy (Power and Petroleum), Finance, Agriculture, Environment, Humanitarian Services, Works and Housing, Trade and Investment, Capital Markets, Aviation and Transport, ICT, among others Kindly share this story: All rights reserved.

Hong Kong Flu (1968) The H3N2 influenza pandemic, often known as the Hong Kong Flu, killed an estimated one million people worldwide. HIV/AIDS pandemic (1981) Despite the fact that it is not an influenza virus, HIV/AIDS has had a tremendous worldwide impact, resulting in nearly 40 million deaths since the pandemic began. SARS (2002) While the SARS outbreak was relatively short-lived, it had a high fatality rate of roughly 10%, with around 800 deaths documented.

As winter closes in, concerns regarding the impact of COVID-19 in aged care facilities have ramped up. But with the general public enjoying far more freedom, are there rules in place for friends and family when visiting aged care? The Department of Health and Aged Care continues to call for strong and effective infection prevention and control practices for aged care providers and staff. Their clearest directions can be found in the National Statement of Expectations on COVID-19 Management in Aged Care Settings. Released in December, the document outlines nationally consistent principles and best practices surrounding COVID-19 in aged care, plus the expected responsibilities of providers if an outbreak occurred. There are clear expectations that providers and staff remain ready for outbreaks of all levels by ensuring that Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) settings are in place and can be scaled up quickly if needed. However, there is no government regulation that stipulates visitors or aged care workers must have vaccines, and it’s up to the individual aged care provider if they elect to make vaccination mandatory or not. What does the Government say? A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Aged Care said: “The Government encourages all Australians to stay up to date with their influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations to aid protection against both infection and severe disease, including accessing a 2023 booster dose when eligible. All of us have a role to play in protecting our own health, the health of our loved ones, and supporting our health systems. Vaccination continues to be important in managing the risk related to infectious diseases including influenza and COVID-19 in high-risk settings, such as aged care.” The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) recommends that anyone who has not received a COVID-19 vaccine dose or had a confirmed infection in the past six months receives a 2023 booster dose if they’re 65 or older, or aged 18-64 and are at higher risk of complications due to medical comorbidities or have a disability with significant or complex health needs. For all other adults, ATAGI recommends they consider a 2023 booster dose if their last dose or infection occurred over six months ago. ATAGI now provides these recommendations regardless of the number of previous doses or boosters someone’s had. Almost 19.6 million people aged 18+ have received their COVID-19 vaccination, which counts as two initial doses while approximately two-thirds of aged care residents are not fully vaccinated. The Department also recommended all providers continue to monitor and follow advice from the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia and National Guidelines for the Prevention, Control and Public Health Management of Outbreaks of Acute Respiratory Infection in Residential Care Facilities. Do staff need to be vaccinated? As per State and Government recommendations, residential aged care providers can enforce their rules regarding vaccinations, masks and testing. There is no Government mandate for residential aged care employees to be fully vaccinated with a 2023 booster, although they are strongly recommended to be up to date if eligible. As providers are now enforcing their own rules and policies to comply with Aged Care Quality Standards and Work Health and Safety (WHS), staff may also find themselves having to test more regularly than other people. Some providers continue to ask staff members to test daily with a rapid antigen test (RAT), while others may not even require workers to wear masks when they’re not around residents. What about flu vaccines? Residential aged care providers are required to have a mandatory flu vaccination program in place to comply with the Aged Care Quality Standards. Providers must take appropriate precautions to prevent and control the spread of the flu, which includes offering free flu vaccinations to staff and volunteers annually. Your provider should notify you of key dates to book a flu vaccination and they are often provided on-site to help encourage uptake. What should visitors do about COVID-19? It’s important that all visitors double-check specific rules with the provider to ensure they’re in a position to look after staff and residents. They may have rules in place that differ from other settings and you should follow them. To best protect yourself and others you should avoid going to an aged care facility or high-risk setting if you have been exposed to COVID-19 or have any COVID-19 or flu symptoms. If you have no symptoms but have tested positive, you should still wait until at least seven days have passed. It’s still recommended to wear a mask when entering high-risk settings, and many homes still have mask-wearing rules in place for staff and visitors. You can find more information on COVID-19 advice for people in residential aged care and visitors on the Department of Health and Aged Care’s website.

Δ Glenys Harrington says: 4 September 2023 at 5:27 pm Interesting article, however your audience should be made aware of the discrepancy between staff COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for private versus public residential aged care facilities. For those who are not aware while COVID-19 vaccinations are no longer mandated for staff in private residential aged care facilities, they are mandated in public residential aged care services operated by a public hospital, public health service or denominational hospital. Given the number of ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks that are occurring in the residential aged care setting (see below), all residents should be afforded the same protection strategies, not just those in public residential aged care facilities. In the month of August 2023 there were 88 active outbreaks, many of which were in private facilities and some of these outbreaks included large numbers of resident and staff cases along with resident deaths. See link below: https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-09/covid-19-outbreaks-in-australian-residential-aged-care-facilities-1-september-2023_0.pdf We all should be asking why COVID-19 vaccination is mandated for staff in public residential aged care facilities and not in private residential aged care facilities? Reply Billy Blanks says: 2 May 2024 at 1:30 am What we should be asking is why anyone is mandated to have an experimental gene therapy and is proven over and over to not stop or reduce transmission. Nor does it reduce incidences of hospitalisation. What it is showing, is that it causes permanent heart damage along with multiple other organ damage, blood clots, turbo cancers and I could keep going. Data confirming this has been coming thick and fast for years now.

Video / NZ Herald New Zealand is in for another large and early flu season, with virologists already tracking fast-rising rates – and the return of long-absent strains known to hit children hardest.Ahead of the season, virologists had been warning of another bumper year for influenza, with an earlier peak – as seen in 2022′s “twindemic” - on the back of re-introduced strains and more international arrivals seeding cases.Those predictions now appeared to be confirmed, ESR’s Dr Sue Huang said, with reported flu cases more than doubling over the space of the last month – and rising fast.The agency’s latest lab-based virology report also showed that, of 1240 cases of influenza specimens received since the start of the year, more than 260 were influenza B strains, which have been circulating in the Northern Hemisphere and often affected younger and school-aged children.Surveillance had picked up few of these B strains last season, when the flu swept back in force to make for the biggest surge in a decade – and there was concern their return could help fuel another major wave in 2023.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Similarly, there’d been little H1N1 “swine flu” in the mix last season, yet 226 specimens of the strain had already been processed in ESR and hospital laboratories this year.Another 716 cases of influenza A – a group including H1N1 – hadn’t been typed.“H1N1 and flu B are the two viruses we really haven’t seen for more than three years,” Huang said.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“We last had an H1N1 outbreak back in 2018, while flu B was co-circulating here in 2019.”Because of the “immunity gap” that came with New Zealand’s flu-squashing pandemic measures, Huang said large sections of the population would be susceptible to the two returning strains.“As we’re seeing more of these [strains] travelling down to New Zealand, and because we no longer have closed borders, this partly explains why we’re seeing this flu activity.”ESR virologist Dr Sue Huang.

Photo / 123RF Public health physician Dr Jonathan Jarman said the study likely pointed to a wider problem of poor ventilation across the country’s ECE centres – particularly in colder regions.“People are reluctant to open windows when it is cold. Many do not realise that heat pumps only recirculate air and do not bring in fresh air from outside.”As CO2 monitoring made an “invisible problem visible”, Jarman and fellow health researchers have recommended the Ministry of Education (MoE) roll out monitors to all centres before winter, just as they were provided to state and state-integrated schools last year.“Understandably we have become fixated on Covid over the last three years but there are also all the other respiratory viruses that cause illness in children,” he said.“And it is not just the kids that get sick. They take the bugs home and give them to the rest of their family and to the grandparents.“Measuring CO2 and improving ventilation should become routine for all ECEs, as well as all the other things they do to protect the health of their children.”AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.The ministry had already taken some steps to address the problem.MoE’s acting operations and integrations leader Karen Walfisch said licensing criteria for centre-based services required ventilation – natural or mechanical – that allowed fresh air to circulate, particularly in sanitary and sleep areas.The ministry also published ventilation guidance for schools and centres, she said, and last year provided funding for around 1700 centres to help purchase portable Aranet4 CO2 monitors.“Early childhood services and other education providers are also able to purchase additional CO2 monitors and air purifiers at a discounted price directly from the ministry’s supplier.”SaveShareShare this articleCopy LinkEmailFacebookTwitter/XLinkedInRedditLatest from New ZealandNew ZealandUpdated'I still can’t believe this is actually real': North Shore family celebrating $30.2m Lotto win12 Nov 01:46 AMNew ZealandUpdated'Significant congestion': Auckland Harbour Bridge lanes to close during rush hour hīkoi protest12 Nov 01:26 AMNew ZealandTurtle troubles in Napier: 'It is totally irresponsible to release them to the wild'12 Nov 12:54 AMSponsored: Make sure your valuables are coveredsponsoredAdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Latest from New Zealand'We're marching to a promised land': Hīkoi attracts thousands in Whangārei12 Nov 01:57 AMIt's only day two but the Government is already nervous, hīkoi organisers say.'I still can’t believe this is actually real': North Shore family celebrating $30.2m Lotto win12 Nov 01:46 AM'Significant congestion': Auckland Harbour Bridge lanes to close during rush hour hīkoi protest12 Nov 01:26 AMTurtle troubles in Napier: 'It is totally irresponsible to release them to the wild'12 Nov 12:54 AMsponsoredOtago pinot leads NZ wine resurgenceNZ HeraldAbout NZ HeraldMeet the journalistsNewslettersClassifiedsHelp & supportContact usHouse rulesPrivacy PolicyTerms of useCompetition terms & conditionsOur use of AISubscriber ServicesNZ Herald e-editionsDaily puzzles & quizzesManage your digital subscriptionManage your print subscriptionSubscribe to the NZ Herald newspaperSubscribe to Herald PremiumGift a subscriptionSubscriber FAQsSubscription terms & conditionsPromotions and subscriber benefitsNZME NetworkThe New Zealand HeraldThe Northland AgeThe Northern AdvocateWaikato HeraldBay of Plenty TimesRotorua Daily PostHawke's Bay TodayWhanganui ChronicleVivaNZ ListenerWhat the ActualNewstalk ZBBusinessDeskOneRoofDriven CarGuideiHeart RadioRestaurant HubNZMEAbout NZMENZME careersAdvertise with NZMEDigital self-service advertisingBook your classified adPhoto salesNZME Events© Copyright 2024 NZME Publishing LimitedTOPRKI: Zweite Grippewelle der Saison beendet Autoren ePaper Service Shop Anzeigen Mein DÄ Suche For authors ePaper Shop Search Suche Deutsches Ärzteblatt Deutsches Ärzteblatt PP Perspektiven Medizin studieren News Blogs Foren Preise Industrieinformationen INTERNATIONAL STUDIEREN Ärzteblatt cme Ärztestellen Studieren English Edition Ärzteblatt CME Ärztestellen Studieren English Edition Home | Archiv | Rubriken Recherche DÄ-Titel PP-Titel Perspektiven ePaper Zeitreise Merkliste Industrie­informationen DÄ-Titel Aktuell Einsatz von medizinischen Einmalhandschuhen in Praxen und...

Fachleute datierten das Ende rückwirkend auf die Woche bis zum 9. April, wie aus dem Wochenbericht der Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza am Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI) von gestern hervorgeht. Demnach führen jüngst aber verschiedene weitere Atemwegserreger immer noch zu einer vergleichsweise hohen Rate solcher Infektionen in der Bevölkerung. Seit Anfang Oktober sind bundesweit mehr als 290.000 im Labor bestätigte Grippeerkrankungen und in dem Zusammenhang 1.010 Todesfälle gemeldet worden. Die Meldezahlen stellen nur einen kleinen Ausschnitt des tatsächlichen Geschehens dar. Die Schwere der Welle wird vom RKI in der Regel im Nachhinein beurteilt. In dieser Saison hatte es bereits vor dem Jahreswechsel eine außergewöhnlich frühe Grippewelle gegeben: verursacht durch Influenzaviren des Subtyps A(H3N2). In der zweiten Welle waren Influenza-B-Viren vor­herrschend. zum Thema Wochenbericht der Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza aerzteblatt.de Atemwegserkrankungen: Krankschreibungen auf Spitzenwert Grippe: KBV will Senioren Nutzung herkömmlicher Impfstoffe weiter ermöglichen Zweite Grippewelle der Saison hat begonnen Die jährliche Grippewelle begann in den Jahren vor Corona laut RKI meist im Januar und dauerte drei bis vier Monate.

Photo for illustrative purposes only. Image Credit: Shutterstock | Reuters Highlights Influenza A viruses were first identified in birds in 1963. After initially showing up in North American waterfowl in 2002, H3N8 has been known to be circulating since then. It is known to affect horses, dogs, donkeys, pigs and seals. WHO reported the world's first human death from H3N8 bird flu. H3N8 “avian flu”, or "bird flu" is also known as equine influenza A virus. The virus is known to have the ability to infect other specifies, including dogs and humans. It is not typically transmitted to humans, though there have been a few reported cases of human infections. Recent studies, and an April 2023 World Health Organisation (WHO) report, provide important insights into the avian flu viral infections, the genetic changes that may be contributing to its virulence, and the effectiveness of vaccines in protecting against the virus. Bird flu situation ‘worrying’; WHO working with Cambodia No human-to-human bird flu transmission found in Cambodia China records world's first human death from H3N8 bird flu: WHO China detects first human case of H3N8 bird flu What you need to know about H3N8: What is it? H3N8 is a subtype of the Influenza A virus, which belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family, first identified in birds in 1963. It is closely related to the modern horse Influenza A virus subtype H3N8. This subtype is a highly contagious respiratory illness that affects a variety of animals, and is commonly found in wild birds. Usually, it causes only mild or no disease in infected birds. However, they have crossed the species barrier and have been associated with outbreaks in horses, dogs, donkeys, pigs and seals. When and how did it cross the species barrier? H3N8 avian flu virus is believed to have crossed the species barrier from horses to dogs in the 2000s. In 2002, researchers found that an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in a pack of English foxhounds in the UK was caused by what was then known as an “equine influenza A virus” (H3N8). They discovered that canine lung tissue possesses the receptors for infection with influenza virus found in horses. Researchers found that more than 96 per cent of the “nucleotides” (organic molecules composed of a nitrogenous base, a pentose sugar and a phosphate) in these viruses are identical. In 2004, canine influenza virus subtype H3N8 emerged in greyhound dogs in the US, from horses. Moreover, evidence indicated virus circulation in dog breeds other than greyhounds. In 2005, a team of researchers at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), based on Atlanta, conducted virologic investigation of 7 non-greyhound dogs that died from respiratory disease in Florida and isolated influenza subtype H3N8 virus. This indicates that the complete virus was directly transferred from horses to dogs without “reassortment” with other strains, according to a 2005 research that studied the transmission of equine influenza virus to dogs, published in the journal Science. In 2011, more than 160 harbour seals died along the New England coast in the US, during which the avian H3N8 virus was isolated by investigators. What illness does the virus cause? The virus can cause mild to severe respiratory symptoms, including: Coughing Fever Nasal discharge Pneumonia In some cases, it can lead to death. What mutations had been seen in the H3N8 virus? In September 2014, a study led by St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital scientists found the avian Influenza A H3N8 virus that killed the harbour seals can spread through respiratory droplets and posed a threat to humans. The researchers, whose work was published in the journal Nature Communications, discovered the virus had “naturally-acquired mutations” in a key protein that previous laboratory research had shown allowed the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus to spread though respiratory droplets. Recent studies on H3N8 avian flu: (2018) “Infectivity and pathogenicity of H3N8 equine influenza virus in dogs”. This study investigated the potential for H3N8 avian flu to infect dogs. The researchers found that while the virus could infect dogs, it did not cause severe disease and was not easily transmitted from dog to dog. (2020) “Evaluation of a single-dose H3N8 influenza vaccine in dogs”. This study evaluated the efficacy of a single-dose H3N8 avian flu vaccine in dogs. The researchers found that the vaccine was highly effective in protecting dogs against the virus and that a single dose was sufficient to provide immunity for at least six months. (2021) “Molecular characterisation of H3N8 equine influenza virus responsible for an outbreak in 2018 in Indian horses”. This study analysed the genetic makeup of an H3N8 avian flu virus responsible for an outbreak in Indian horses in 2018. The researchers found that the virus had undergone genetic changes that may have contributed to its increased virulence. (2022) “A child with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by avian influenza H3N8 virus”. This study was published in the Journal of Infection (Issue 2, 2022). It was the first case of human infection with H3N8 virus. Researchers found that the clearance time of H3N8 virus in human lungs is "prolonged". They found that after the H3N8 virus infects the human body, it can cause severe “interstitial lung lesions”, and patients can develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARDS). Experts recommended continued surveillance and genetic analyses to monitor possible emergence of variants of the virus. Monitoring of all avian influenza viruses is considered important given their ability to evolve and cause a pandemic, according to the WHO. Photo for illustrative purposes only. What does the WHO say about H3N8 infections in humans? In August 2022, a four-year-old boy tested positive for the H3N8 strain after being admitted to the hospital with a fever and other symptoms, according to a Reuters report. The boy's family kept chickens at home and resided in a region where wild ducks were common, the report added. The boy was infected directly by birds. However, the strain was not found to have the “ability to effectively infect humans”. On April 12, 2023, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that a 56-year-old woman was the first human death on record from H3N8 “bird flu”. The patient had multiple underlying conditions, said the WHO, and a history of exposure to live poultry. Are there vaccines available top help prevent H3N8 infection? There are vaccines available for H3N8 in horses and dogs, as several outbreaks in horses and dogs were recorded over the years. The vaccines, typically given as a series of two doses, are designed to prevent horses from becoming ill or spreading the virus to other horses. For dogs, the vaccine is recommended if they are at high risk of exposure to the virus, such as those that go to dog parks or boarding facilities. A vaccine for use in dogs to protect against the canine influenza virus (CIV), which includes the H3N8 subtype, has also been approved. However, there are no vaccines specifically designed for H3N8 in humans as the virus strain does not typically cause infections in humans. What precautions are advised? As for H3N8 avian flu in humans, confirmed cases are rare and typically involve people who have had close contact with infected animals. In general, the risk of human infection with H3N8 avian flu is considered to be low. The WHO, however, advises the following: “To minimise the risk of infection, countries should increase public awareness of the importance of avoiding contact with high-risk environments such as live animal markets/farms, live poultry, or surfaces that may be contaminated by poultry or bird faeces.” “It is recommended to maintain good hand hygiene by frequently washing hands or using alcohol-based hand sanitiser and wearing respiratory protection when in a risky environment.” “Travellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces or other body fluids. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices,” the WHO stated.
