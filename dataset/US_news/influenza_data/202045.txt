With deaths from the 1918 influenza pandemic estimated at >50,000,000 and future pandemics anticipated, the need for a potent influenza treatment is critical. In this study, we design and synthesize a bifunctional small molecule by conjugating the neuraminidase inhibitor, zanamivir, with the highly immunogenic hapten, dinitrophenyl (DNP), which specifically targets the surface of free virus and viral-infected cells. We show that this leads to simultaneous inhibition of virus release, and immune-mediated elimination of both free virus and virus-infected cells. Intranasal or intraperitoneal administration of a single dose of drug to mice infected with 100x MLD50 virus is shown to eradicate advanced infections from representative strains of both influenza A and B viruses. Since treatments of severe infections remain effective up to three days post lethal inoculation, our approach may successfully treat infections refractory to current therapies.

The annual financial burden associated with treating these illnesses has been estimated at $4.6 billion and costs stemming from the accompanying loss of work have been projected at $7 billion2. While most influenza virus infections remain nonlethal and containable, their worldwide impact on morbidity and mortality remains one of the most adverse of any infectious disease.Three general approaches have demonstrated efficacy in controlling influenza virus. First, vaccines against common influenza antigens have proven successful in limiting the severity and spread of the virus during years when the most aggressive viral strains are correctly predicted. Unfortunately, due to the rapid evolution of the virus, annual formulations of the vaccine often fail to match the most virulent strains, resulting in many vaccinated patients still contracting an infection3,4,5. Second, neuraminidase inhibitors have been designed to block the viral neuraminidases required for release of the virus from its host cell surface6,7. Although four neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir) have been approved for treatment of influenza in different parts of the world, they commonly provide little benefit when administered more than two days after symptoms appear, leaving a large fraction of infected individuals with no treatment to mitigate symptoms6. Moreover, the emergence of low levels of variant viruses with reduced susceptibility to the above neuraminidase inhibitors has raised concerns that widespread circulation of viruses with reduced drug susceptibility can occur8,9,10. Third, baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) and related drugs impede the synthesis of viral mRNAs by suppressing the cap-dependent endonuclease of both influenza A and B viruses11,12. However, although studies reveal that baloxavir can reduce the viral load and alleviate influenza symptoms, baloxavir-resistant strains have already been identified in patients13, suggesting that its efficacy as a broad-spectrum therapy may be affected.In the study below, we explore a hybrid of the above two therapeutic approaches, where we take advantage of both the potent antiviral activity of a broad spectrum viral neuraminidase inhibitor and the powerful immunological function of a vaccine. Briefly, we exploit the fact that influenza virus-infected cells express one or more viral proteins on their cell surfaces14, thereby distinguishing them from adjacent healthy cells (Fig. 1a). While cell surface viral neuraminidases are intrinsically antigenic, we enhance their immunogenicity by decorating them with a potent hapten (i.e., in this case, a dinitrophenyl moiety; DNP) (Fig. 1b). Even though the origin of the antibodies against DNP and other nitroarenes is not known, they comprise ~1% of circulating antibodies in human serum and are competent to induce ligand-targeted cytotoxicity15,16,17,18. Moreover, rather than using a functionally inert ligand to target this hapten, we deliver the DNP moiety attached to a potent neuraminidase inhibitor, namely zanamivir (Fig. 1c), since zanamivir binds to neuraminidases of all known subtypes/lineages of influenza A and B viruses19. Because virtually all humans naturally express anti-DNP antibodies18, the resulting zanamivir-DNP conjugate (zan-DNP) can not only block the activity of an essential viral enzyme, but also recruit the immune system to attack the virus or virus-infected cells.Fig. 1: Dual mechanisms of action of neuraminidase-targeted anti-influenza therapy.a Both influenza virus and influenza virus-infected cells express a viral neuraminidase (orange receptor) on their membrane surfaces. b Binding of a zanamivir-dinitrophenyl conjugate (zan-DNP) to these neuraminidases not only inhibits neuraminidase activity and thereby suppresses virus budding from the host cell, but also decorates both the free virus and infected host cell with the highly immunogenic hapten, dinitrophenyl (DNP). This painting of the virus and infected host cell with zan-DNP then recruits naturally occurring anti-DNP antibodies that are present in the blood of virtually all humans, resulting in opsonization of the virus/virus-infected cell and the consequent immune-mediated clearance of the virus/infected cell. c zan-DNP was synthesized by conjugating zanamivir (targeting ligand) with 2,4-dinitrophenyl group (hapten) via a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain (linker).Full size imageHere, we show that zan-DNP inhibits neuraminidases of both influenza A and B viruses and concurrently recruits anti-DNP antibodies to virus-infected cells. Because this anti-DNP binding mediates destruction of the opsonized virus and virus-infected cells, treatment with zan-DNP is observed to eradicate even the severe viral infections where mice are inoculated with 100× MLD50 of viral load and therapy is not initiated until 3 days post-infection. Considering that a single intranasal or intraperitoneal dose of zan-DNP yields a complete response, we suggest that further development of zan-DNP as a universal anti-influenza therapy is warranted.Resultszan-DNP retains high binding affinity for neuraminidasesIn order to target a potent hapten to different subtypes/lineages of influenza virus and influenza virus-infected cells, we needed a receptor that was accessible on all viral particles and their infected host cells, as well as a ligand that would bind specifically to this influenza-specific receptor. Because influenza neuraminidase satisfies both criteria (i.e., it is abundantly expressed on both free viral particles and virus-infected cells), and since zanamivir binds to all known subtypes of groups A and B influenza virus neuraminidases6, we selected zanamivir as the targeting ligand for delivery of a hapten to neuraminidase-expressing particles/cells. As shown in the crystal structure of a zanamivir-neuraminidase complex (Fig. 2a), the C-7 hydroxyl of zanamivir is exposed to solvent and available for linkage to an immunogenic hapten20,21. Based on this observation, we linked either a dinitrophenyl hapten (for therapeutic purposes) or rhodamine (for use in binding assays) to this C-7 hydroxyl via a PEG-related linker (Fig. 1c and Fig. 2b, respectively). As revealed in the binding curve of Fig. 2c, zanamivir-rhodamine conjugate (zan-rhodamine) associates with a representative member of group 1 neuraminidases (N1) of influenza A virus with a dissociation constant of 4.9 nM. That this interaction is neuraminidase-mediated is confirmed by the ability of 100-fold excess free zanamivir to block zan-rhodamine binding. Use of the same zan-rhodamine to measure binding of free zanamivir and zan-DNP via competitive binding analysis then yielded binding affinities of 0.3 nM and 0.8 nM, respectively. Moreover, use of the same rhodamine-labeled zanamivir conjugate to quantitate binding of zanamivir and zan-DNP to a representative member of group 2 neuraminidases (N2) of influenza A virus afforded similar binding constants of 1.0 nM and 1.1 nM, respectively (Fig. 2d). Because the substrate-binding sites are similar within all members of group 1 (N1, N4, N5, and N8) and group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, and N9) neuraminidases of influenza A virus22, we conclude that attachment of a therapeutic or imaging agent to the C-7 position of zanamivir does not significantly interfere with zan-DNP binding to influenza virus A neuraminidases. The binding affinity of zan-DNP was also tested on two strains of influenza B virus (Fig. 2e, f). Even though attachment of DNP to zanamivir reduced the binding affinity of the conjugate for influenza B virus neuraminidases ~8 to 10-fold compared to zanamivir (i.e., a common consequence of ligand derivatization23), the binding affinity still remained in the low nanomolar range. Finally, an analogous binding study was performed on virus-infected normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells grown at air–liquid interface (ALI). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a, a similar binding constant of 1.4 nM was observed for zan-rhodamine associates with the neuraminidase (N1) of influenza A virus.Fig. 2: Binding affinity and specificity of zan-DNP for viral neuraminidases.a Crystal structure of N1 neuraminidase of influenza A virus complexed with zanamivir (PDB code: 3TI5). Note that the C-7 hydroxyl of zanamivir is exposed to solvent and available for linkage to DNP. b Structure of zanamivir-rhodamine conjugate (zan-rhodamine). c–f Binding of zan-rhodamine (direct binding curve, left panel), zanamivir (competitive binding curve, central panel), and zan-DNP (competitive binding curve, right panel) to neuraminidase expressed on MDCK cells infected with influenza virus A/Wisconsin/629-D00015/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 (c), A/Netherlands/22/2003 (H3N2) (d), B/Florida/4/2006 (Yamagata Lineage) (e) or B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria Lineage) (f). All the virus-infected cells were used 24 h post-infection for binding studies. Data are presented as mean values ± SD (n = 3).Full size imageTo assure that zan-DNP can also inhibit the neuraminidase activity necessary for protecting cells from virus infection, we compared the potencies of zanamivir and zan-DNP in suppressing the cytopathic effect caused by virus infection in an MDCK-influenza virus co-culture. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, zan-DNP can reduce the cytopathic effect of both influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) virus infections with a potency similar to zanamivir alone (EC50 = 1.7 and 7.6 nM, respectively). These data thus suggest that the use of zanamivir to target an attached immunogenic hapten to free virus or virus-infected cells will not significantly compromise the anti-neuraminidase activity of zanamivir.zan-DNP recruits anti-DNP antibodies to virus-infected cellsThe second therapeutic mechanism in our dual-function antiviral conjugate was designed to recruit the immune system to eradicate the virus/virus-infected cells. For this purpose, we decorated the virus/virus-infected cells with an immunogenic hapten that would recruit anti-hapten antibodies to the surface of the viral particles/infected cells. Following evaluation of multiple haptens in the literature, the dinitrophenyl (DNP) hapten was selected for conjugation to zanamivir because anti-DNP antibodies are naturally present in essential all human sera; i.e., obviating the need to induce anti-DNP antibody production via vaccination against DNP17,24.To assess the ability of zan-DNP to recruit anti-DNP antibodies to virus-infected cells, we first employed biotinylated anti-DNP antibodies to enable visualization of the antibodies on virus-infected MDCK cells. As seen in the confocal micrographs of Fig. 3a, anti-DNP antibodies bind only to MDCK cells that have been infected with influenza A(H1N1) virus and then treated with zan-DNP. In contrast, no antibody binding was seen when MDCK cells were either not infected or infected with virus and treated with zan-DNP in the presence of 100-fold excess zanamivir (to block all zan-DNP binding to neuraminidase). Binding of anti-DNP antibodies could also be shown by quantitating the fluorescence of cell-bound streptavidin-PE in the presence of excess anti-DNP antibody as a function of the concentration of zan-DNP. As shown in Fig. 3b, as the concentration of zan-DNP was increased in the culture medium, binding of anti-DNP antibodies to infected MDCK cells steadily increased until all zan-DNP sites were eventually saturated.Fig. 3: Anti-DNP antibodies recruiting, complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of neuraminidase expressing cells induced by zan-DNP.a and c Confocal micrographs of binding of biotinylated anti-DNP antibodies (visualized by streptavidin-PE) to the surface of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (a) and A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) (c) virus-infected MDCK cells mediated by zan-DNP (n = 3). Nuclear staining is shown in blue, and streptavidin-PE staining is shown in red. b, d Binding of anti-DNP antibodies to influenza A(H1N1) (b) and A(H3N2) (d) virus-infected MDCK cells determined by quantitating the fluorescence of cell-bound streptavidin-PE in the presence of anti-DNP antibodies as a function of the concentration of zan-DNP (n = 3). All the virus-infected cells were used 24 h post-infection for the above studies. e Flowcytometry analyses of recruitment of anti-DNP antibodies to virus-infected cells mediated by zan-DNP in vivo (n = 3). A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 virus-infected mice (3 mice/group) were first given zan-DNP and anti-DNP antibodies (3 days post-infection). 12 h later, the cells digested from the lung of virus-infected/uninfected mice were stained first with anti-hemagglutinin antibodies and then labeled with dye conjugated secondary antibodies against anti-hemagglutinin antibodies and anti-DNP antibodies. Left: selected flow cytometry plots; Right: summary graph. Statistical difference of antibody stained positive cells (%) between indicated two groups was analyzed by two-sided t test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, see exact P values in Supplementary Table 1). f CDC mediated killing of N1 neuraminidase transduced and nontransduced HEK 293 cells mediated by zan-DNP in the presence of anti-DNP antibodies and complement-preserved rabbit serum (n = 3). g Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of N1 neuraminidase transduced and nontransduced HEK 293 cells mediated by zan-DNP in the presence of anti-DNP antibodies and human FcγRIIIa expressing effector cells (n = 3). ADCC activity is proportional to the amount of firefly luciferase produced by effector cells (detected as the luminescence intensity). The coding sequence of N1 neuraminidase for the transduction of HEK 293 cells is from strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1); Data are presented as mean values ± SD (n = 3).Full size imageBinding of anti-DNP antibodies to a representative member of group 2 neuraminidases of influenza A(H3N2) virus yielded very similar results (Fig. 3c). Thus, binding was totally dependent on the presence of zan-DNP, anti-DNP antibodies, and streptavidin-PE, and binding could be quantitatively prevented by blockade of the neuraminidase sites with excess zanamivir. Similarly, analysis of anti-DNP antibody binding as a function of zan-DNP concentration demonstrated saturable binding that was dependent on zan-DNP association with the infected MDCK cells (Fig. 3d). Finally, when an analogous antibody recruitment assay was performed on virus-infected NHBE cells grown at ALI, a similar dependence of antibody binding on the concurrent presence of zan-DNP, anti-DNP antibodies, and anti-human IgG-PE was observed (Supplementary Fig. 1b).To document the ability of zan-DNP to recruit anti-DNP antibodies to virus-infected lung cells in-vivo, we challenged mice with 100x MLD50 of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 virus prior to treatment with 0.5 μmol/kg zan-DNP or zanamivir plus anti-DNP antibodies (5 mg/kg, intravenous administration) (anti-DNP antibodies were added because mice naturally produce significantly lower levels of anti-DNP antibodies than humans, see Supplementary Fig. 3). Following digestion of the infected lungs, isolated lung cells were evaluated for anti-DNP antibody binding by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 4, 24.4% of infected lung cells (i.e., hemagglutinin positive cells) were found to be opsonized with antibody in mice treated with zan-DNP. In contrast, replacement of zan-DNP with zanamivir resulted in only 0.8% of the infected lung cells exhibiting antibody positivity, and when uninfected mice were treated with zan-DNP only 1.7% of lung cells were found to be antibody positive. Finally, when zan-DNP was administered to virus-infected mice lacking anti-DNP antibodies, only 0.4% of infected lung cells were determined to be opsonized with antibody. These data demonstrate that significant antibody binding only occurs in vivo when lung cells are exposed to virus, zan-DNP and anti-DNP antibodies, and that absence of any one of these components abrogates antibody binding.zan-DNP mediates CDC and ADCCHaving established that zan-DNP can recruit anti-DNP antibodies to the surfaces of virus-infected cells, we next elected to explore whether membrane bound anti-DNP antibodies could promote complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). For this purpose, HEK 293 cells were transduced with N1 neuraminidase of influenza A virus (to avoid any intrinsic cytotoxicity caused by the live virus, Supplementary Fig. 5 shows the binding affinity of zan-DNP to this transduced neuraminidase is 3.0 nM) and then incubated with zan-DNP plus anti-DNP antibodies and complement proteins. As shown in Fig. 3f, complement-mediated killing of the neuraminidase-expressing cell was dependent on the simultaneous presence of viral neuraminidase, zan-DNP and anti-DNP antibodies (more than 60% killing, red line), and abrogated (blue and black line) or significantly reduced (~10% killing, green line) when any one of these components was blocked or omitted. Importantly, maximum cell death was observed at a zan-DNP concentration of only 10 nM, emphasizing the potency of this immune contribution to virus elimination.Second, to explore whether zan-DNP binding might mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), N1-transduced HEK 293 cells were incubated with human anti-DNP antibodies plus Jurkat cells engineered to induce firefly luciferase expression upon participation in ADCC25. As seen in Fig. 3g, no ADCC was observed when (i) zan-DNP binding was blocked with 100-fold excess zanamivir (blue line), (ii) anti-DNP antibodies were deleted from the reaction mixture (green line), or (iii) HEK 293 cells not transduced with N1 neuraminidase were used as target cells (black line). However, potent ADCC was seen when N1-transduced cells were co-incubated with engineered Jurkat cells in the presence of both zan-DNP plus anti-DNP antibodies. These data together with the data on CDC demonstrate that zan-DNP can promote influenza virus-infected cell killing by multiple mechanisms, leading to likely resolution of the disease. Importantly, the bell-shaped response curves shown in Fig. 3g are anticipated, since high concentrations of zan-DNP will inhibit antibody binding after its bridging function has become saturated.zan-DNP is superior to zanamivir when tested in vivoWith evidence that zan-DNP can promote destruction of neuraminidase expressing cells in the presence of anti-DNP antibodies, the question naturally arose whether zan-DNP can prevent influenza virus-infected mice from progressing to a lethal infection. To explore this issue, we first vaccinated BALB/c mice against DNP (because mice naturally produce significantly lower levels of anti-DNP antibodies than humans, see Supplementary Fig. 3) and then inoculated the mice intranasally (IN) with a lethal dose (100x MLD50) of either influenza A(H1N1) or A(H3N2) virus (see Supplementary Fig. 6 for the general procedure of mouse therapy studies). Daily measurements of body weight then demonstrated that these severely infected mice began to lose weight 2 days post-infection and continued to lose weight until euthanasia was mandated due to weight loss ~6 days post-infection (Fig. 4a, left panel). To explore the ability of zanamivir (Relenza) to treat this severe infection, free zanamivir was administered IN twice daily for 5 days per its usual dosing regimen in humans26. As seen in Fig. 4a, treatment of mice twice daily with 0.5 µmol/kg (0.2 mg/kg) zanamivir beginning 24 h post-infection had little effect on body weight loss and only minor impact on overall survival (blue lines), i.e., suggesting that 0.5 µmol/kg (0.2 mg/kg) zanamivir was ineffective in reversing a lethal viral infection (see Supplementary Fig. 7a for dose ranging study). Similarly, IN administered nontargeted DNP provided no protection against infection-induced weight loss or rapid mouse death (orange lines). In contrast, mice vaccinated against DNP and treated IN with zan-DNP were found to fully recover from the same lethal dose of influenza virus, as evidenced by prevention of virus-induced weight loss and virus-promoted death (red lines). That most of this protection was immune-mediated could be demonstrated by the observation that failure to vaccinate the mice against DNP abrogated the protection (purple lines). These data argue that zan-DNP is far more effective in treating a lethal influenza A(H1N1) virus infection than unmodified zanamivir, and that the source of this enhanced potency derives primarily from its additional ability to recruit the immune system to eliminate the infection.Fig. 4: Therapeutic efficacy of zan-DNP in protecting mice from lethal influenza virus infections.DNP-KLH immunized BALB/c mice were challenged with 100x MLD50 of the different strains of influenza virus indicated above. Mice were treated with the indicated test articles by intranasal administration (IN) using the dosage regimens indicated above each panel. Mice were counted as dead when they lost either 25% of their initial weight or became moribund. Body weight curves (left panels) and survival curves (right panels) for each treatment are shown. (a) compares the efficacy of zan-DNP with its component parts (5 mice/group for zan-DNP and zanamivir treatment groups, 8 mice/group for the rest of the groups). (b) examines the effect of different delays between virus inoculation and zanamivir or zan-DNP administration on weight loss and animal survival (5 mice/group). (c) investigates the potency of a single dose of either zanamivir or zan-DNP on the same parameters in mice infected with viruses indicated above (5 mice/group). Statistical differences between PBS and drug treatment groups were determined by two-sided log-rank test (*P < 0.005, see exact P values in Supplementary Table 1). Body weight change (%) are presented as mean values ± SD.Full size imageA major problem with neuraminidase inhibitors has been their inability to treat infections when administered late in the infection process. In order to investigate whether zan-DNP might prove more effective in treating advanced infections, mice inoculated with a lethal dose of influenza A(H1N1) virus were treated IN with 0.5 µmol/kg zan-DNP (0.7 mg/kg) as described above, only treatment was not initiated until 48, 72, or 96 h after virus inoculation. As shown in Fig. 4b, virus-induced weight loss was minimal in the cohort that was first treated 48 h post-infection, but somewhat more prominent in the 72 h and 96 h cohorts. Moreover, 100% of the animals in the 48 h cohort and 80% of the animals in the 72 h cohort survived the infection. Furthermore, when the dose of zan-DNP was increased from 0.5 to 1.5 μmol/kg, a similar therapeutic effect was observed (Supplementary Fig. 7b). In contrast, identical studies performed on zanamivir-treated mice revealed an unimpeded weight loss in the 48 h cohort, with all animals either dying from infection or requiring euthanasia (due to weight loss) in this cohort. Similar to Fig. 4a, these data also demonstrate that zan-DNP is more effective in treating an influenza A(H1N1) virus infection than free zanamivir.Because use of an inhaler 2x/day for 5 days might prove inconvenient for some patients, the question next arose whether the frequency or duration of treatment with zan-DNP might be reduced as a means of improving compliance. To explore this issue, a dose frequency study was performed in which zan-DNP was either administered IN 1x/day for 5 days, every other day for 6 days (i.e., 3x) or only once at 24 h post-infection. As seen in Supplementary Fig. 7c, all three dosing regimens, including the single dose at 24 h, eliminated any virus-induced death and prevented infection-induced weight loss. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4c, the single dose of zan-DNP was also able to prevent any deaths in multiple strains of both influenza A and B virus-infected mice, even though all of the zanamivir alone treated mice died from the infection. Importantly, this remarkable difference in potency could also be demonstrated by monitoring virus titers in the lungs of the infected mice as a function of time following infection (Supplementary Fig. 8). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that a single treatment with zan-DNP should prove sufficient to treat an influenza virus infected patient.Parenteral administration of zan-DNP is equally potentUnfortunately, some patients cannot use an inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor, either because congestion in their lungs obstructs inhibitor access to the infected alveolar epithelial cells or because the inhaled inhibitor is not well-tolerated27. For these patients, an intravenous (IV) formulation of zanamivir has recently proven to be highly beneficial28. To determine whether a parenterally administered (i.e., tail vein injected) zanamivir-drug conjugate might similarly gain access to virus-infected lung cells, we first prepared a zanamivir-chelate conjugate that binds 99mTc with high affinity by replacing the DNP moiety of zan-DNP with a chelator of 99mTc (Fig. 5a, also see Supplementary Fig. 9 for the radiochemical purity of zan-99mTc). Analysis of zan-99mTc binding to influenza virus-infected MDCK cells revealed that the conjugate associates with the influenza virus-infected cells with an apparent Kd = 15.1 nM (Fig. 5b). Evidence that this binding is specific for influenza-expressed neuraminidase is provided by the observation that this binding is quantitatively inhibited upon competition with 100-fold excess of free zanamivir. More importantly, demonstration that IV administered zan-99mTc localizes specifically to virus/virus-infected cells in lungs of influenza virus inoculated mice is supplied by biodistribution data in which influenza virus-infected or uninfected mice were injected IV (tail vein) with zan-99mTc and then analyzed 4 h later for radioactivity in all major tissues. As shown in Fig. 5c, the highest percent injected dose per gram tissue (% ID/g) was found in the lungs (red bar), which constitutes the primary organ in which influenza virus locates. More importantly, this uptake is shown to be totally viral neuraminidase-specific by its absence in mice co-injected IV with 100-fold excess free zanamivir (blue bar). The fact that lungs from uninfected mice injected IV with the same dose of zan-99mTc exhibit no uptake (green bar) further confirms this specificity. While some radioactivity is noted in the kidney, this zan-99mTc is almost certainly undergoing excretion, since the uptake is not significantly reduced by 100-fold excess free zanamivir nor absent from kidneys in uninfected mice. Importantly, all other tissues/organs displayed only background retention of zan-99mTc, confirming that tissue accumulation of zan-99mTc is specifically viral neuraminidase mediated. Further documentation of this virus specificity can be seen in the SPECT-CT images of Fig. 5d, where a strong zan-99mTc signal is observed in the lungs of virus-infected mice (left panel) but absent from infected mice co-injected with excess zanamivir. Interestingly, there is no detectable zan-99mTc signal observed in the nose and trachea. This may be due to the fact that the amount of virus and virus-infected cells in these sites is much lower than that in the lung. Taken together, these studies thus confirm that parenteral administration of zanamivir-linked drug constitutes a feasible route for delivery of antiviral drugs to infection sites in the lungs.Fig. 5: Examination of the properties of parenteral administration of zan-DNP.a Structure of zanamivir-99mTc conjugate (zan-99mTc). b Binding of zanamivir-99mTc to N1 neuraminidase (expressed on A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus-infected MDCK cells) in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of 100-fold excess zanamivir (competitor) (n = 3). c Biodistribution of intravenously injected (IV) zan-99mTc in A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus-infected mice (3 mice/group). d SPECT/CT images showing the locations of intravenously injected zan-99mTc in A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus-infected mice (left panel) or virus-infected mice which concurrently received 100-fold excess free zanamivir (right panel) (3 mice/group). a: lung; b: kidney; c: bowels. e Weight loss and survival curves of virus-infected mice treated with zan-DNP or zanamivir. DNP-KLH immunized BALB/c mice (5 mice/group) were challenged with 100x MLD50 of the influenza virus strains indicated above each panel. Mice were treated with a single dose of zan-DNP by intraperitoneal administration (IP) 24 h post-infection. Mice were counted as dead when they lost either 25% of their initial weight or became moribund. Statistical differences between PBS and drug treatment groups were determined by two-sided log-rank test (*P < 0.005, see exact P values in Supplementary Table 1). Data are presented as mean values ± SD.Full size imageNext, to explore whether mice inoculated with the usual lethal dose of influenza virus might be rescued with a single parenteral dose of zan-DNP, mice that were lethally-infected with either type A [PR8 (H1N1), X31 (H3N2), or A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09] or type B [B/Florida/4/2006] influenza viruses were injected intraperitoneally (IP) 24 h post-infection with 1.5 or 4.5 μmol/kg zan-DNP or 4.5 μmol/kg zanamivir and then monitored for weight loss and overall survival (Fig. 5e, also see Supplementary Fig. 10 for dosing ranging and comparison studies). As revealed in the figure, all mice treated with unmodified zanamivir died within 7 days of virus inoculation, whereas mice treated with even the lowest concentration of zan-DNP all survived. Although both zan-DNP and zanamivir treated mice experienced a similar weight loss over the initial 3 days of infection, all of the zan-DNP treated mice recovered their normal body weights by 10 days post-infection whereas the zanamivir treated mice continued their uninterrupted weight loss until death. The fact that a high level of protection was observed when neuraminidases from both influenza A and B viruses were targeted confirms the broad-spectrum of activity that characterizes this therapy.Analysis of efficacy of exogenous anti-DNP antibodies in vivoFinally, because some influenza virus patients may have naturally occurring anti-DNP antibody titers that are too low for therapeutic efficacy (see endogenous titer analyses among healthy volunteers in Supplementary Fig. 3), we elected to evaluate whether co-injection of exogenous anti-DNP antibodies might successfully substitute for endogenous anti-DNP antibodies in mediating an effective anti-influenza immune response. For this purpose, non-immunized mice were inoculated with the usual lethal dose of influenza A(H1N1) virus (i.e., 100× MLD50) and then treated 24 h later with 1.5 µmol/kg zan-DNP (2.0 mg/kg) plus different concentrations of exogenous anti-DNP antibodies ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg. As shown in Fig. 6a, all three doses of exogenous anti-DNP antibodies mediated total recovery from weight loss and complete responses in virus-infected mice, whereas (i) substitution of zanamivir for zan-DNP, (ii) omission of anti-DNP antibody, or (iii) treatment solely with PBS yielded no recoveries from weight loss and incomplete responses to lethal infections. Furthermore, to confirm the generality of the efficacy of anti-DNP antibody supplementation, we performed similar studies on another commonly used laboratory strain (X31 H3N2) plus two additional circulating strains (A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 and B/Florida/4/2006). As anticipated, zan-DNP, but not unmodified zanamivir, was found to yield complete responses in all virus-infected mice in the presence of exogenous anti-DNP antibodies (Fig. 6b). These data demonstrate that injection of exogenous antibodies can be exploited to compensate for any insufficiency in endogenous antibodies in mediating a zan-DNP therapy of an influenza virus infection.Fig. 6: Therapeutic efficacy of co-administration of zan-DNP plus exogenous anti-DNP antibodies in protecting nonimmunized mice from a lethal influenza virus infection.a Nonimmunized BALB/c mice were challenged with 100x MLD50 of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) prior to treatment with a single dose of 1.5 μmol/kg zan-DNP (intranasal administration, IN) plus exogenous anti-DNP antibodies (1–10 mg/kg, intravenous administration, IV) 24 h post-infection (3 mice/group for 3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg anti-DNP antibody treatment groups, 5 mice/group for the rest of the groups). Control groups include (i) substitution of zanamivir for zan-DNP, (ii) omission of anti-DNP antibodies, and (iii) treatment with PBS. b Nonimmunized BALB/c mice (5 mice/group) were challenged with the indicated strains of influenza virus prior to treatment with a single dose of 1.5 μmol/kg zan-DNP or zanamivir (IN) plus 10 mg/kg exogenous anti-DNP antibodies (IV) 24 h post-infection. Mice were counted as dead when they lost either 25% of their initial weight or became moribund. Statistical differences between PBS and drug treatment groups were determined by two-sided log-rank test (*P < 0.005, see exact P values in Supplementary Table 1). Body weight change (%) are presented as mean values ± SD.Full size imageDiscussionBecause multidrug combination therapies generally outperform monotherapies, it was not surprising that a combination of neuraminidase inhibitor with an immunogenic hapten would improve on the potency of the neuraminidase inhibitor. However, with data documenting that individuals receiving an influenza vaccine can still contract infections from viral strains contained in the vaccine29, together with studies showing that neuraminidase inhibitors can only mitigate an influenza infection when administered early during the infection process6, the potent eradication by zan-DNP of advanced infections involving very high viral loads was not anticipated. Thus, the ability of zan-DNP to yield complete responses in mice infected with 100 times the MLD50 of influenza virus up to 3 days after inoculation was not predicted from data on vaccinated individuals receiving the traditional nontargeted zanamivir. Perhaps the fact that each virus-infected cell is concurrently exposed to two orthogonal therapies; i.e., one that blocks release of budding virus and a second that promotes immune-mediated destruction can account for the heightened potency. Alternatively, the fact that most current vaccines are targeted to viral hemagglutinins30,31, whereas the immune component of zan-DNP targets viral neuraminidases may somehow explain the unexpected potency.In addition to remarkable potency, several other features of zan-DNP render attractive for further development. First, unlike the traditional flu vaccines, the immune component of the zan-DNP therapy does not require an ability to predict which viral strains will emerge during the forthcoming flu season5. Because zanamivir is believed to treat infections caused by all known subtypes/lineages of influenza A and B viruses19, the identity of the strains most likely to propagate should become less important. Second, the route of zan-DNP administration may afford the physician additional treatment options not available with zanamivir. Thus, mice receiving zan-DNP either intranasally or intraperitoneally were found to respond to drug roughly equivalently. If airway congestion or other physical limitations were to found to obstruct administration of zan-DNP intranasally, the physician would have the option to administer the same dose of drug intraperitoneally, subcutaneously or intravenously. Third, unlike other neuraminidase inhibitors, binding of zan-DNP to released viral particles should contribute to free virus elimination, whereas zanamivir binding is not thought to recruit immune involvement. For example, antibody/complement opsonized viral particles would still be expected to undergo phagocytosis by Fc receptor expressing cells, whereas zanamivir bound viruses would not. Finally, as noted above, zan-DNP (unlike other neuraminidase inhibitors) appears to lose potency only late in the infection/propagation process (see Fig. 4b), whereas zanamivir has been found to decline in potency rapidly after symptoms first appear6.It has not escaped our attention that other targeting ligands and immunogenic haptens could have easily been used instead of zanamivir and/or DNP to create related ligand-hapten immunotherapies. Thus, influenza hemagglutinins are similarly exported to the surface of virus-infected cells and hemagglutinin ligands are similarly available to deliver haptens to these viral receptors32,33. Moreover, influenza M2 proteins are also trafficked to infected cell surfaces and should be similarly accessible for ligand-hapten binding14. Since additional haptens are known against which endogenous anti-hapten antibodies pre-exist in human sera (e.g., anti-rhamnose, anti-alpha-galactosyl, anti-tetanus, etc.)18, opportunities to develop totally orthogonal ligand-hapten conjugates that could similarly promote eradication of virus-infected cells seem abundant. Thus, if strains of virus were ever to emerge that exhibited reduced affinity for zanamivir, additional ligand-hapten conjugates could be developed to augment the zan-DNP therapy.Because many life forms including humans, other mammals and even bacteria express an isoform of neuraminidase, the question naturally arises whether off-target recognition of an endogenous neuraminidase might lead to unwanted toxicity. While an absolute answer to this concern must await human clinical trials, it should be noted that most bacterial neuraminidases bind zanamivir with IC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 5 mM34; i.e., one million times weaker than influenza virus neuraminidase (IC50 ~0.5–3 nM), and the four isoforms of human neuraminidase enzymes bind zanamivir at least a few thousand times weaker than influenza neuraminidase35. When considered with the observation that little if any non-specific uptake of zanamivir-99mTc conjugate was seen in mice not inoculated with influenza virus (Fig. 5c, green bars), one can conclude that dose-limiting target toxicity to healthy tissues is not very likely.The use of a low molecular weight homing ligand to target an attached drug specifically to a diseased cell type has received growing interest in recent years. Thus, ligand-targeted drugs have been developed for treatment of multiples cancers23, autoimmune diseases36,37, fibrotic diseases, and tissue traumas38, with improved potencies and decreased off-target toxicities reported in most cases. Although direct comparisons have not been made, the specificity of zan-DNP for its disease-specific receptor appears to be much greater than the specificity of any previous ligand-targeted drug for its cognate receptor (Fig. 5c), i.e., with competable uptake being restricted almost exclusively to the lungs of infected mice. Although the previously targeted receptors (e.g., folate receptor, prostate specific membrane antigen, carbonic anhydrase IX, EGF receptor, etc.) all exhibit expression in a subset of healthy cells23, zan-DNP should have no healthy cell counterpart, perhaps accounting for its virus-infected cell specificity.Finally, it should be emphasized that the ligand-hapten targeting strategy for killing pathologic cells has already been explored for treatment of many other diseases. Thus, the first ligand-hapten immunotherapy was applied to eradication of folate receptor overexpressing cancers in both murine tumor models39 and human patients with renal cancer40. Although folate replaced zanamivir and fluorescein replaced DNP in these studies, complete tumor eradications were seen in animal studies and partial responses with minimal toxicities were observed in the phase 1 human clinical trials. Perhaps encouraged by these data, related hapten-targeted immunotherapies were subsequently developed for treatment of melanomas41 and prostate cancers42, with very promising data reported in animal models in both cases. Hapten-targeted immunotherapies have also been explored for suppression of activated macrophages in murine models of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases36,37, with animal data again demonstrating impressive efficacy in all cases. More recently, related ligand-targeted hapten therapies have been developed to kill HIV-, bacteria- and fungus-infected cells, with analogous promising data again reported in all cases18,43,44. Taken together, these congruent data from multiple labs suggest that decoration of a pathogenic cell with a strongly immunogenic hapten can mediate eradication of the pathogenic cell in a variety of diseases. And although any cell decorated with DNP hapten will likely be destroyed by the immune system, the data in Fig. 5c showing receptor expression limited to infected tissues specifically argue that off-target toxicities should be minimal.MethodsCompound SynthesisThe detailed syntheses of zanamivir-related influenza neuraminidase targeting ligand, zan-DNP, zan-rhodamine, and zan-99mTc are shown in Supplementary Information.Cell lines/viruses/miceMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cell growth medium was prepared according to the Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza45: Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (high glucose, Invitrogen—cat. no. 11965-092), 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS), 2% bovine albumin fraction v (BSA) (7.5%), 2% HEPES (1 M), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in DMEM medium containing 10% HIFBS, 1% HEPES (1 M), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2: 95% air).Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were purchased from Lonza and cultured in bronchial epithelial cell growth medium (BEGM, Lonza). To establish the cell culture at air–liquid-interface (ALI), NHBE cells at passage two were seeded on 12 mm transwell inserts in 12-well plates (Corning) and grown submerged in BEGM. When cells reached completely confluency, the medium in apical chambers was removed and the medium in basal chambers was replaced with HBTEC Air-Liquid Interface Differentiation Medium (Lifeline Cell Technology). The cells were maintained at ALI for at least 21 days to ensure full differentiation. The basal medium was changed every 2 days and the cells were washed with HBSS weekly to remove mucus.Influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (Catalog No. NR-348), A/Aichi/2/1968 (HA, NA) × A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H3N2) reassortant X-31 (Catalog No. NR-3483), A/Wisconsin/629-D00015/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 (Catalog No. NR-19806), A/Netherlands/22/2003 (H3N2) (Catalog No. NR-49236), B/Florida/4/2006 (Yamagata Lineage) (Catalog No. NR-41795), B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria Lineage) (Catalog No. NR-42006) and A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 (non-mouse-adapted virus, Catalog No. NR-13663) were obtained from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH. Influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (tissue culture adapted, Catalog No. VR-1469™) and A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) (Catalog No. VR-1680™) were purchased from ATCC.Female BALB/c mice (3–4 week old: up to 12 g; 6–9 week old: 16 to 21 g) were purchased from Envigo (location: Indianapolis, IN, United States). All animal procedures were approved by Purdue Animal Care and Use Committee (PACUC).TCID50 endpoint dilution assayInfectious influenza virus titers were determined by a 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) endpoint dilution assay46. For this purpose, serial 10-fold dilutions of influenza virus were mixed with equal volumes of MDCK cells at 2 × 105 cells/mL (all the virus and cell solutions were prepared using virus growth medium: high glucose DMEM containing 2% BSA, 2% HEPES (1 M), 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 2 µg/ml TPCK-trypsin). The mixtures of cells and virus were then added to 96-well plates at 100 µl/well. After incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 48 h, cell viability was measured by CellTiter 96® AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). TCID50 was calculated using the Reed–Muench method47.Preparation of influenza virus infected-MDCK cellsInfections of MDCK cells with influenza virus were performed using a standard method45. Low-passage MDCK cells were seeded in 24-well plates or confocal microscope plates. When cells reached confluence, cell growth medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed 2x with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cells were then inoculated with influenza virus at 100 TCID50 (100 µl/well) and incubated to absorb virus at 37 °C for 1 h. During the incubation period, the plates were tapped every 15 min to redistribute the inoculum. At the end of the inoculation, 500 µl virus growth medium (high glucose DMEM containing 2% BSA, 2% HEPES (1 M), 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 2 µg/ml TPCK-trypsin) was added to each well and the plates were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 to allow the virus-infected MDCK cells to express influenza neuraminidase.Saturation binding assayThe binding affinity of zan-rhodamine for neuraminidases (expressed on influenza virus-infected cells) was measured by saturation binding assay. Influenza virus-infected MDCK cells in 24-well plates were prepared as described above, and on the day of the experiment spent medium was aspirated and virus-infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 0.5 mL of fresh medium containing increasing concentrations of zan-rhodamine in the presence or absence of 100-fold excess of unmodified zanamivir. Virus-infected cells were then rinsed with fresh medium (2 × 0.5 mL) to remove unbound zan-rhodamine and dissolved in 0.5 mL of 1% aqueous sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In total 200 µl of SDS solution from each well was transferred to 96-well black walled plates (Corning) and cell-associated fluorescence was measured by Synergy Neo2 HTS Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Biotek) using an excitation of 560 nm and emission of 620 nm. The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated by plotting the cell bound fluorescence intensity versus the concentrations of zan-rhodamine using GraphPad Prism 7 (Saturation binding equations, One site—Total and nonspecific binding).For the assays performed with NHBE cells grown at ALI, the cells were washed with PBS to remove the mucus and then apically inoculated with influenza virus (MOI of 1, measured in MDCK cells) diluted in 100 µl BEGM without TPCK-trypsin. After inoculation at 37 °C for 1 h, the inoculum was aspirated, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 36 h before use. On the day of the experiment, the basal medium was aspirated and virus-infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 0.3 mL of fresh medium containing increasing concentrations of zan-rhodamine in the presence or absence of 100-fold excess of unmodified zanamivir. Virus-infected cells were then rinsed with fresh medium (2 × 0.3 mL) to remove unbound zan-rhodamine and dissolved in 0.3 mL of 1% aqueous sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In total 200 µl of SDS solution from each transwell insert was transferred to 96-well black walled plates (Corning) and cell-associated fluorescence was measured, as mentioned above.Competitive binding assayThe binding affinity of zanamivir or zan-DNP for viral neuraminidases was measured using a competitive binding assay. Influenza virus-infected MDCK cells in 24-well plates were prepared, as described above. On the day of each experiment, spent medium was aspirated and virus-infected cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 0.5 mL of fresh medium containing 15 nM zan-rhodamine plus increasing concentrations of either zanamivir or zan-DNP. Virus-infected cells were then rinsed with fresh medium (2 × 0.5 mL) to remove unbound zan-rhodamine and dissolved in 0.5 mL of 1% aqueous sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Cell-associated fluorescence was measured using the plate reader as described above. The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated by plotting the cell bound fluorescence intensity versus the log of the concentration of unlabeled compound using GraphPad Prism 7 (competition Binding equations, One site – Fit Ki).In vitro virus inhibition assayThe in vitro antiviral activity of the compounds was evaluated in MDCK cells and expressed as the concentration of compound that protects 50% of cells from virus-induced death (EC50). MDCK cells were harvested and plated in 96-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/mL (50 µl). Serial 3-fold dilutions of each compound were then mixed with equal volumes of influenza virus at 100 TCID50. Following ~10 min incubation, the mixtures of compound plus virus (50 µl) were added to MDCK cells and the suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h under 5% CO2. Cell viability was then measured using CellTiter 96® AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). EC50 values were measured by plotting the absorbance at 450 nm (indicating the viability of the cells) versus the log of each compound’s concentration using GraphPad Prism 7.Confocal microscopy analysis of anti-DNP antibody recruitmentAntibody recruitment by cell surface bound zan-DNP was analyzed by culturing influenza virus-infected MDCK cells in confocal microscope plates as described above and on the day of each experiment removing spent medium and incubating the virus-infected cells for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.5 mL of fresh medium containing 50 nM zan-DNP in the presence or absence of 5 µM zanamivir. Virus-infected cells were then washed with fresh medium (2 × 0.5 mL) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.5 mL of 20 µg/mL anti-DNP IgG-biotin conjugate (Invitrogen, cat. no. A-6435). Virus-infected cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 0.5 mL of 5 µg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE) conjugate (BD Biosciences). After the final wash (2 × 0.5 mL), the virus-infected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and cell nuclei were stained with TO-PRO®-3 Iodide (Invitrogen). Confocal images were then acquired by confocal microscopy (FV 1000, Olympus).For the assays performed with NHBE cells grown at ALI, the cells were washed with PBS to remove the mucus and then apically inoculated with influenza virus (MOI of 1, measured in MDCK cells) diluted in 100 µl BEGM without TPCK-trypsin. After inoculation at 37 °C for 1 h, the inoculum was aspirated, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 36 h before use. On the day of the experiment, the basal medium was removed, and the virus-infected cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.3 mL of fresh medium containing 50 nM zan-DNP in the presence or absence of 5 µM zanamivir. Virus-infected cells were then washed with fresh medium (2×0.3 mL) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.3 mL of 10 µg/mL human anti-DNP IgG1 (ACROBiosystems, cat. no. DNP-M2). Virus-infected cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 0.3 mL of 5 µg/mL goat anti-human F(ab′)2-PE (Abcam, cat. no. ab98596). To identify virus-infected cells, the cells were concurrently stained with 0.3 mL of 10 µg/mL rabbit anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Sino Biological Inc, cat. no. 86001-RM01) followed by 0.3 mL of 10 µg/mL goat anti-rabbit IgG-AF647 (Invitrogen, cat. no. A-21244). After the final wash (2 × 0.3 mL), the transwell inserts were placed on glass slides and confocal images were acquired by confocal microscopy (FV 1000, Olympus).Preparation of neuraminidase-expressing HEK293 cell lineThe coding sequence for neuraminidase from influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) was cloned into lentiviral transfer vector pWPI (addgene). The transfer vector was then co-transduced into HEK293TN cells using the Ready-to-Use Packaging Vector mixture (Cellecta) plus Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen). Culture supernatants were harvested and used to transduce HEK293 cells. After 48 h of transduction, cells were sorted by flow cytometry for GFP positive cells and further subcloned. Subcloned line was used as target cells in CDC and ADCC assays described below.Complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assayAnalysis of virus-infected cell killing by CDC was conducted by an CDC assay44. N1 transduced HEK 293 cells and nontransduced HEK 293 cells were harvested and plated in triplicate (25 µl, 4 × 105 cells/mL) in 96-well black walled plates (Corning) and then treated with serial 5-fold dilutions of zan-DNP in the presence or absence of 100-fold excess of zanamivir. After incubating at rt for 30 min, 50 µl of a solution containing 40 µg/mL rabbit anti-DNP IgG (Invitrogen, cat. no. A-6430) and 20% (v/v) rabbit complement serum (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. One hundred percent cell death was achieved by adding 5% H2O2 to the HEK 293 cells and cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The percent zan-DNP mediated CDC was calculated as: 100 × (luminescence no zan-DNP–luminescence expt)/(luminescence no zan-DNP–luminescence maxkilling).Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assayAnalysis of ADCC was performed using an ADCC kit (Promega, cat. no. G7010) plus N1-transduced and nontransduced HEK 293 cells. For this purpose, cells were plated in triplicate (25 µl, 4 × 105 cells/mL) in 96-well black walled plates (Corning) and then treated with serial 5-fold dilutions of zan-DNP in the presence or absence of 100-fold excess zanamivir. After incubating at rt for 30 min, 25 µl of 33.3 µg/mL human anti-DNP IgG1 (ACROBiosystems) were added to each well and the plates were incubated at rt for 30 min. Finally, ADCC effector cells were added at 75,000 cells/well and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The amount of firefly luciferase produced by ADCC effector cells was then quantified using Bio-GloTM Luciferase Assay Reagent (included in the kit). Luminescence was measure using Synergy Neo2 HTS Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Biotek). % zan-DNP mediated ADCC was calculated as: luminescence expt–luminescence no zan-DNP.Mouse immunizationInduction of anti-DNP antibodies in mice was performed according to a published method42. DNP-hemocyanin conjugate (DNP-KLH, MilliporeSigma) was dissolved in autoclaved water at 1 mg/ml and emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA, Sigma-Aldrich) or incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant (IFA, Sigma-Aldrich). The emulsification was conducted through a stepwise addition method48. In total 3–4 week old BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail first with 200 µl of CFA emulsified DNP-KLH solution and then 2 weeks later with 200 µl of IFA emulsified DNP-KLH solution. Mouse serum samples were collected 2 weeks later to test for the presence of anti-DNP antibodies.ELISA for detection of anti-DNP antibodiesELISA 96-well plates (Fisher Scientific) were coated at 4 °C overnight with 100 µl of 5 µg/ml BSA-DNP (Invitrogen) dissolved in coating buffer (1.0 L deionized water containing 8.4 g NaHCO3 and 3.56 g Na2CO3, pH: 9.5). Plates were washed 3x with ELISA wash buffer (BioLegend) and incubated with blocking buffer (10% FBS in PBS) at rt for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. After washing 4x with ELISA wash buffer, wells were treated with 100 µl of serial 10-fold dilutions of human/mouse serum in blocking buffer and incubated at rt for 2 h. Plates were then washed 4x with ELISA wash buffer and incubated for 2 h at rt with 100 µl of anti-human IgG-HRP, anti-human IgM-HRP, anti-mouse IgG-HRP or anti-mouse IgM HRP (1:5000 dilution in blocking buffer, Invitrogen). After washing 4x with ELISA wash buffer, plates were treated with 100 µl/well freshly prepared TMB substrate solution (BioLegend) and allowed to react for 5 min before the enzymatic reactions were terminated by adding 100 µl 1 N HCl. The optical density was then read at 450 nm (O.D.) using Synergy Neo2 HTS Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Biotek), and the results were plotted as average absorbance values at 450 nm versus log serum dilution factors.Virus challenge and mouse therapy studiesDetermination of the viral titer required to kill 50% of inoculated mice (MLD50) was achieved by anesthetizing 6–9 week old BALB/c mice (5 mice/group) with isoflurane and inoculating the mice intranasally (IN) with 50 µl of serial 10-fold dilutions of influenza virus. Mice were weighed and monitored daily for 14 days post-infection and counted as dead when they either lost 25% of their body weight or were diagnosed as moribund. MLD50 titers were then calculated using the Reed–Muench method47.For evaluation of drug efficacy in mice immunized with DNP-KLH, BALB/c mice were challenged IN with 100x MLD50 of influenza virus. During the following two weeks, mice (5 mice/group) were then treated with different concentrations of test articles (zan-DNP, zanamivir, DNP or PBS) according to the indicated dosing regimens. In the studies in which mice were treated IN with test articles, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane before the treatment. Mice were then analyzed as above.For analysis of therapeutic efficacy in non-immunized mice, mice (5 mice/group) were first challenged IN with 100x MLD50 of influenza virus and then administered (24 h post-infection) a single IN dose of drug (zan-DNP, zanamivir, or PBS, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane before the treatment) followed by a single intravenous (IV) dose of rabbit anti-DNP IgG (Invitrogen, cat. no. A-6430). Mice were then analyzed as above.Flow cytometry analysis of anti-DNP antibody recruitmentAround 6–9 week old mice (3 mice/group) were inoculated IN with 100x MLD50 of influenza virus A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09. Three days after infection, mice were administrated with a single dose of 0.5 μmol/kg zan-DNP or zanamivir (IN) plus 5 mg/kg rat anti-DNP antibodies (IV) (Invitrogen, cat. no. 04-8300). Twelve hours later, the lungs of virus-infected/uninfected mice were harvested immediately after euthanasia. The right lungs were digested using gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) with mouse lung dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no. 130-095-927). The cell suspension was filtered through 70 μm cell strainer (Miltenyi Biotec) and washed 2x with PBS. The erythrocytes were removed using red blood cell lysis buffer (Biolegend) followed by PBS wash. The resulting cells were resuspended in freezing medium (90% FBS plus 10% DMSO) and stored at –80 °C for future flow cytometry analyses (if the cells are used immediately after digestion, they should be incubated with FBS to block the non-specific bindings of secondary antibodies). After thawing, cells were blocked with TruStain FcX™ antibody (Biolegend) and then labeled with rabbit anti-hemagglutinin antibody (1:100 dilution, Sino Biological Inc, cat. no. 86001-RM01) for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed 3x with PBS and then stained with goat anti-rat IgG-PE (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen, cat. no. A10545) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-AF647 (1:1000 dilution, Invitrogen, cat. no. A-21244) for 20 min on ice. The cells were washed 3x with PBS and analyzed using Attune NxT Flow Cytometer.Quantitation of lung viral titersDNP-KLH immunized mice were inoculated IN with 100x MLD50 of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) as described above and then treated 24 h later with a single IN dose of 1.5 µmol/kg (2.0 mg/kg) zan-DNP, zanamivir, or PBS. Mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation 3 and 5 days post-infection, and their lungs were harvested and immediately homogenized using gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec)49. Viral titers from the lung homogenates were measured by real time RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from the homogenates using Quick-RNA™ Microprep Kit (ZYMO RESEARCH). cDNA synthesis and reverse transcription were performed according to a standard protocol50. The primer/probe sets were synthesized to recognize two highly conserved regions of influenza matrix (M) gene (see sequences in Supplementary Table 2). To construct a standard curve for calculation of viral titers, 10-fold dilutions of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) stock solution with a known viral titer were run in parallel with the lung homogenates.Preparation of a zan-99mTc formulation kitThe following reagents for radiolabeling of zanamivir-chelate precursor (compound 14) with 99mTc were prepared and purged with argon: sodium gluconate (Sigma-Aldrich) in water (250 mg, 2.5 mL); ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) disodium salt dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) in water (30 mg, 3.0 mL); and tin(II) chloride dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.2 N HCl (50 mg, 5 mL). To 2.5 mL of sodium gluconate solution was added 300 µl of EDTA solution and 100 µl of Tin(II) chloride solution while purging with argon. To this solution was added 1.6 mg zanamivir-chelate precursor (1340 nmol; compound 14) while bubbling with argon. After adjusting the solution pH to 6.8 using argon purged 1.0 N NaOH and 0.2 N HCl, the volume of the solution was increased to 10 mL by adding argon-purged water. The final solution was dispensed to formulation vials (1.0 mL/vial) under argon and lyophilized for 48 h. Vials were sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum seals under argon atmosphere and stored at –80 °C until use.Radiolabeling of zanamivir-chelate precursor with 99mTcWhen desired, a zan-99mTc formulation vial was warmed to rt and injected through a septum with sodium pertechnetate 99mTc solution (1.0 mL, 15 mCi, Cardinal Health) and then swirled gently to dissolve the lyophilized powder. After allowing to stand at rt for 15–20 min, 2 ml of air was injected into the vial to oxidize any excess stannous ion. The solution was then stored at rt and used within 6 h.Analysis of zan-99mTc binding to virus-infected MDCK cellsBinding of zan-99mTc to influenza neuraminidase (expressed on influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1)-infected cells) was measured by saturation binding assay. Influenza virus-infected MDCK cells in 24-well plates were prepared as described above. On the day of the experiment spent medium was aspirated and virus-infected cells were incubated with 0.5 mL of fresh medium containing increasing concentrations of 99mTc labeled zan-99mTc in the presence or absence of 100-fold excess of zanamivir free drug. After incubating for 1 h at 4 °C, virus-infected cells were then rinsed with fresh medium (3 × 0.5 mL) to remove unbound radioligand and dissolved in 0.5 mL of NaOH (0.25 M). Cell lysates from each well were transferred into γ-counter tubes and the cell-bound radioactivity was counted using a γ-counter (Packard, Packard Instrument Company). The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated by plotting the cell bound radioactivity versus the concentrations of zan-99mTc using GraphPad Prism 7 (Saturation binding equations, One site—Total and nonspecific binding).Biodistribution and SPECT-CT imaging of zan-99mTc in vivoIn total 6 to 9 week old mice (3 mice/group) were inoculated IN with 100x MLD50 of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1). Three days after infection, mice were administrated 100 µl of 99mTc labeled zan-99mTc (1.3 nmol, 150 µCi) diluted in PBS via tail vein injection. Mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation 4 h after injection. Each mouse was dissected, and selected tissues/organs were collected into γ-counter tubes. Radioactivity of weighed tissues/organs were counted and counts per minute (CPM) values were decay corrected. Results are reported as percent injected dose per gram of wet tissue (% ID/g): 100 × (CPM tissue/CPM injected dose)/Wt. of tissue.A second batch of 6–9 weeks old mice (3 mice/group) were infected with 50 µl of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) as above, and three days later administered 100 µl of 99mTc labeled zan-99mTc (6.5 nmol, 750 µCi) via tail vein injection. Mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation 4 h after injection and SPECT-CT imaging was performed using micro-SPECT II/CT (MILabs). 3D reconstruction was then conducted using ImageJ software.Statistics and reproducibilityStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, CA). For flow cytometry analysis of anti-DNP antibody recruitment (Fig. 3e) and quantitation of lung viral titers (Supplementary Fig. 8), the statistical difference between two groups were determined using an unpaired two-sided t-test with a 95% confidence interval (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). For all of the mouse therapy studies, a two-sided log-rank test was applied to compare the survival difference between PBS (or untreated) and drug treatment groups (*P < 0.005). For confocal microscopy analysis of anti-DNP antibody recruitment (Fig. 3a, c, Supplementary Fig 1b), the experiments were repeated twice independently with similar results. All other in vitro experiments were performed once (in triplicate). All live mouse experiments were performed once (the number of mice used for each experiment is indicated in figure legends).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Saving Lives, Protecting People Search Submit Influenza (Flu) Ad Council 2020-2021 No Time for Flu Campaign EspaÃ±ol | Other Languages Print Minus Related Pages No Time For FluLow Resolution Video Friday, November 6, 2020 — Flu vaccination is more important than ever in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic because it can reduce the overall amount of flu illness this season, in turn reducing the burden on health care systems and saving medical resources for care of patients with COVID-19. While CDC conducts annual education and awareness campaigns with the goal of increasing flu vaccination, this season, extra work has been done in this area, including the launch of a new campaign called: No One Has Time for Flu. The campaign is the result of a collaboration between The Ad Council, the American Medical Association (AMA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the CDC Foundation, which along with AMA provided campaign funding. The campaign aims to increase vaccine uptake overall, but puts a particular emphasis on reaching African American and Hispanic/LatinX communities, populations that can be disproportionately affected by flu illness and serious flu complications, but are less likely to be vaccinated. Campaign public service announcements (PSAs) presented by the Ad Council run on space donated by TV stations, media outlets, and social media platforms. Many campaign assets, including television public service announcements, are available for viewing and sharing at http://getmyflushot.adcouncilkit.org/. In preparation for the campaign, the Ad Council arranged for quantitative research surveys to be fielded, to help understand behaviors and attitudes towards flu vaccines in 2020 among African American and Hispanic uncommitted consumers, defined as people who had not yet decided to get vaccinated this season. Survey findings showed that 52% of Hispanic adults and 43% of African American adults said they are likely to get a flu shot in 2020. This compares to 63% among White adults. Nearly 40% of both African American and Hispanic respondents remain uncommitted, which compares to just 24% of whites. Research suggests inertia is a big factor in why African Americans and Hispanics do not get a flu vaccine. The top reason given for not getting vaccinated was “I never get the flu shotot something I do.” The Ad Council partnered with fluent360, a creative agency based in Chicago, to develop the creative concept and materials for the No One Has Time for Flu campaign. The PSAs highlight the different circumstances many people are experiencing as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that, now, more than ever, no one has time to be sick with flu.

(Photo Credit: C.J. Lovelace) VIEW ORIGINAL FORT DETRICK, Md. -- With the annual flu season now upon us, the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency is working to distribute nearly 1.6 million doses of influenza vaccine to protect Soldiers, their Families and retirees. USAMMA’s Distribution Operations Center, or DOC, oversees the yearly distribution of the vaccine to active-duty and reserve Soldiers, as well as civilian staff and Family members. The Army makes up the majority of doses ordered throughout the Department of Defense. As of Oct. 28, roughly half of the Army’s doses had been shipped, heading to destinations across the U.S. and abroad. DOC officials plan to have distribution completed by the end of November. USAMMA is a direct reporting unit to Army Medical Logistics Command. The agency’s DOC provides coordination and tracking for select temperature sensitive medical products, like the flu vaccine. It also conducts training for logistical and medical units to ensure proper distribution and storage practices for those products. Lt. Col. Todd Reeder, USAMMA’s pharmacy consultant and DOC director, said there has been a significant push throughout the Army and DOD to raise awareness about the importance of getting a flu shot, especially this year due to influenza symptoms mimicking those of COVID-19. “Having the flu shot will assist health care personnel in determining the possible cause of a patient’s symptoms,” he said. Patients that go to the emergency room with flu-like symptoms will still be tested for both illnesses, but “the hope is that the severity of symptoms from the flu will be much less” with a vaccine and won’t add to the symptoms of COVID-19 in the unlikely event a patient catches both, Reeder said. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it’s unclear to what extent SARS-CoV-2 -- the scientific name of the novel coronavirus strain that causes the disease called COVID-19 -- will circulate over the 2020-21 flu season. In any case, the CDC said the flu vaccine can reduce the prevalence of flu-like illness. It can also reduce symptoms that might be confused with COVID-19. “Prevention and reduction in the severity of influenza illness and reduction of outpatient illnesses, hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions through influenza vaccination also could alleviate stress on the U.S. health care system,” the CDC said. The DOD sets an annual goal of having at least 90% of all active-duty military members vaccinated by Jan. 15 each flu season, which generally begins in the fall and lasts until early spring. While the virus circulates year-round, activity typically begins to increase in October and spikes between December and February, even though seasonal activity can last until May, according to the CDC. Army flu vaccine distribution is a year-round job. DOC officials work closely with the Defense Health Agency and Defense Logistics Agency, which handles yearly procurement and shipping for the DOD. The doses come in different forms to treat a wide variety of people, ranging from infants 6 months and older to folks over 65 years of age. Most people will benefit from a flu vaccination. In most cases, according to the CDC, the risks associated with getting vaccinated are significantly lower than the benefits. The vaccine also has shown to make the flu milder, which may reduce the risk of more serious outcomes such as hospitalizations.

Here, we exploit parallel molecular evolution to understand virulence evolution in avian influenza viruses (AIV). Highly-pathogenic AIVs evolve independently from low-pathogenic ancestors via acquisition of polybasic cleavage sites. Why some AIV lineages but not others evolve in this way is unknown. We hypothesise that the parallel emergence of highly-pathogenic AIV may be facilitated by permissive or compensatory mutations occurring across the viral genome. We combine phylogenetic, statistical and structural approaches to discover parallel mutations in AIV genomes associated with the highly-pathogenic phenotype. Parallel mutations were screened using a statistical test of mutation-phenotype association and further evaluated in the contexts of positive selection and protein structure. Our resulting mutational panel may help to reveal new links between virulence evolution and other traits, and raises the possibility of predicting aspects of AIV evolution.

While most AIVs cause only a mild-to-asymptomatic infection, highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza, restricted to the H5 and H7 AIV subtypes, causes extremely high mortality (up to 100%) in domestic bird populations1. Both low-pathogenic (LP) and HP viruses can cause severe disease in humans following avian-to-human transmission2,3. For example, the emergence of H7N9 AIV in China caused >1500 infections and 615 human deaths between 2013 and early 2018 4. Low virulence AIVs have evolved into HP strains on multiple occasions, resulting in geographically- and temporally distinct outbreaks that cause substantial economic losses to the poultry industry, and pose a risk of avian-to-human spread5,6. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms driving the evolution of virulence in AIVs.Virulence in influenza A viruses is, in general, a complex trait that involves interactions among multiple viral proteins7,8,9. However, the AIV HP phenotype is an unusually simple and well-characterised molecular marker of virulence, and is therefore an attractive system in which to study virulence evolution10. The HP phenotype is conferred by a polybasic cleavage site (pCS) within the viral haemagglutinin (HA) protein. The HA cleavage site is located in the C-terminal domain of HA (Arg-343 in H1 numbering) and is highly conserved among all influenza A viruses, including AIVs11. The insertion of one or more basic amino acids at this site creates a pCS, which renders the HA protein a target for broadly expressed host proteases, facilitating systemic virus spread within avian hosts12. These insertions, and the subsequent emergence of a pCS, have occurred several times during the evolutionary history of AIVs: 25 different pCS sequences have been described for HP H5NX viruses since 1961, and 24 pCS have been described for HP H7NX viruses since 1963 11. However, the evolutionary pathways that lead to the independent, parallel evolution of a pCS, and thus the HP phenotype, are not well understood.Parallel evolution describes repeated evolutionary changes leading to the same phenotype or genotype in independent populations, and can result from adaptation by natural selection to similar selective pressures or ecological niches13,14. We use the term ‘parallel molecular evolution’ to refer to the convergent or parallel molecular genetic changes that lead to the emergence of same phenotype15. RNA viruses exhibit high rates of mutation (i.e. the rate at which errors are made during the virus genome replication), large population sizes, high replication rates, consistently varying environments, and strong selective pressures. These factors, combined with small genome sizes, may restrict the number of mutational pathways that can lead to a given genotype, and may result in parallel molecular evolution being common in RNA viruses16.We hypothesise that the parallel evolution of the HP genotype from LP ancestors in AIV subtypes H5 and H7 may have a genetic basis, and may be therefore associated with permissive or compensatory secondary mutations occurring elsewhere in the AIV genome. Such mutations could arise prior to, or immediately after, the emergence of a pCS, perhaps to compensate for mutations with antagonistic pleiotropy, or which have detrimental effects on protein structure or folding stability17,18. Little is known about the genetic predisposition of AIV to acquire a pCS (except for the role of RNA structure at the cleavage site region itself19), nor about the role of mutations elsewhere in the virus genome that might favour the evolution of the HP phenotype.The main goal of this study is to use a combination of analytical methods, from evolutionary and structural biology, in order to detect parallel mutations across the AIV genome that are positively associated with the evolution of the HP phenotype (hereafter termed HP-cluster associated parallel mutations, or HAPMs). We develop, validate and implement a phylogenetic model of binary trait evolution that tests whether genotype-to-phenotype associations observed across multiple lineages are statistically significant. This approach explicitly incorporates the phylogenetic correlation among observations and thus is less susceptible to error than standard statistical tests20. We further investigate if the HAPMs that we identify had evolved under positive selection, and use existing structural data and computational modelling to explore their possible effects on protein function and/or on structure stability (Fig. 1). We identify numerous HAPMs present in HP AIV strains belonging both to the H5 and H7 AIV subtypes, many of which appear to be associated with other important viral processes, including antigenic escape and replication efficiency. We discuss how the mutational panel presented here can provide a starting point for future molecular studies for the evolution of the HP phenotype.Fig. 1: Summary of analytical approach.A summary of our approach to identifying HAPMs (HP-cluster associated parallel mutations) in AIV genomes. 1. Large-scale data curation and phylogenetic analysis to detect genotypes and phenotypes (HP lineages highlighted in red). 2. Phylogenetically informed subsampling to reduce alignment sizes, whilst retaining HP clusters and key mutational pathways along internal branches. 3. Detecting candidate HAPMs across multiple HP clusters (highlighted in orange) through the reconstruction of ancestral states. 4. Selecting HAPMs by statistical testing for genotype-to-phenotype associations using an evolutionary-informed model (represented in the matrix by aa Y occurring in Site X). 5.

Inferring the possible effects of HAPMs on protein structure stability and function, using existing structural data and experimental literature.Full size imageResultsLarge-scale phylogenetic analysis of independent HP clustersLarge-scale phylogenetic analysis confirmed that H7NX viruses are split into two major clades, the Eurasian and North American lineages (Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Fig. 2)21. H7 HP outbreaks occurred independently through time and space and correspond to distinct lineages that, in most cases, display a unique pCS motif (Fig. 2b)5. LP H7NX viruses carry a consensus amino acid sequence -PEXPKGRGLF- at the HA cleavage site, whereas a minimal consensus of -PEXPKXnK/RnRGLF- is identified for HP viruses11. Nine H7NX HP well-supported clusters that are spatio-temporally distinct were selected for further analyses (Fig. 2a, b). The large-scale phylogeny of H5NX viruses shows a basal clade of H5NX viruses circulating in wild birds worldwide from the late 1960s to the early 2000s (Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). This basal clade is ancestral to the established HP H5N1 lineage (named C8 here), that diverged from A/goose/Guangdong /1/1996 (including sub-lineages 7.2 to 2.3.2.1a)22. Since its emergence in China, this lineage has subsequently spread to Asia, Africa, Europe and America and persists until today22. Within C8, there is a distinct group of HP H5NX viruses, forming clade 2.3.4 and its descendants, that circulate in both wild and domestic birds22. Eight well-supported H5NX HP clusters that are spatio-temporally distinct were selected (Fig. 2c, d). Most HP clusters displayed a unique pCS sequence, except for C8, reflecting the ongoing evolution of this unusually long-lived lineage22 (Fig. 2d).Fig. 2: Historical occurrence of documented HP AIV outbreaks, and independent emergence of HP lineages.a For each H7NX HP case, the recorded date of emergence and duration (in years), the country of emergence (highlighted in red), the virus subtype causing the outbreak, and the reported avian host species are indicated in the map. b Phylogenetic distribution of HP lineages in the H7 subsampled phylogeny. Branches leading to LP sequences are shown in black. HP sequences (highlighted in red) correspond to unique genotypes defined by a pCS (shown next to the phylogeny), as they form independent well-supported lineages (as defined in ‘Methods’, indicated by C1-C9, showing posterior probability and bootstrap support values >80 or 0.8 for nodes of interest), matching the historical occurrence of the documented HP outbreaks. c Historical occurrence of documented H5NX HP outbreaks, following the description used for panel (a). Data for C8 is not included, as since 1996, this lineage circulates worldwide. d Phylogenetic distribution of HP lineages in the H5 subsampled phylogeny, following the description used for panel (b). Distinct, well-supported HP clusters are highlighted in red (C1-C8). The H5NX HP viruses within cluster C8 (clade 2.3.4 and descending lineages) are highlighted in blue.

Maps were further edited using Adobe Illustrator for the purposes needed.Full size imageAlthough reassortment is common among AIVs23, our results do not provide evidence for reassortment within HP lineages themselves, as HP clusters were observed to be monophyletic and well supported in all genome segment trees (Supplementary Figs. 2–4). There are two exceptions to this; the H7N9 cluster C1 that splits into two clusters (C1.1. and C1.2) in all internal genome segment trees, and H5N1 cluster C8, which splits into two clusters (C8.1. and C8.2) in the PB2, PA and NP trees (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). However, due to reassortment, the internal gene segments of HP cluster strains may originate from AIV subtypes other than H7NX or H5NX. Nonetheless, low phylogenetic support in the internal segment trees reflects that the origin of these segments cannot, in many instances, be determined (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). We conclude that most HP clusters for both H5NX and H7NX are short-lived, emerging and dying out within a time-span too short to allow for reassortment. An exception to this is H5NX C8 (i.e. cluster 2.3.4.4), which is a long-established HP lineage in domestic bird populations and is known to have reassorted with other AIVs22,24, as is consequently split within internal genome segment trees.Identifying HAPMs significantly associated with the HP phenotypeThe number of amino acid sites that were polymorphic (i.e. present at >1% frequency) varied among virus subtypes and genome segments. For H7NX viruses, the number of polymorphic sites per segment ranged from 21 (for M1) to 125 (for HA). Maximum likelihood ancestral state reconstructions revealed 16 convergent genetic changes (i.e. candidate HAPMs) that were present in two or more H7NX HP clusters (Supplementary Data 2). For H5NX viruses, between 12 (for M1) and 141 (for HA) polymorphic sites were detected per segment. We identified 39 convergent genetic changes (candidate HAPMs) that were present in two or more H5NX HP lineages (Supplementary Data 2). Of these, 17 occurred within sub-lineages of cluster C8, and were not considered further.To identify those HAPMs significantly associated with the HP phenotype, we developed a phylogenetic model to test the null hypothesis of no association between mutations at each position and the HP phenotype (Supplementary Text 5). For H7NX viruses, we found a strong association with the HP phenotype for 7 out of 16 mutations (see λ and significance in Table 1). For H5NX viruses, a strong association with the HP phenotype was supported for 10 out of 22 mutations (Table 1). For some H7NX HP clusters, we identified a 20-residue deletion within the stalk region of the N1, N3 and N9 strains (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Data 2). However, this deletion was not scored as an HAPM under our model. The frequency of stalk-deletion mutations is known to fluctuate in time and space among both LP and HP viruses25. Although some deletions have been experimentally linked to increased virulence, their occurrence is likely associated with host switching (from wild bird to gallinaceous hosts), rather than with the emergence of the HP phenotype25,26.Table 1 HAPMs significantly associated with the HP phenotype of H5 and H7 virus subtypes.Full size tableOur ancestral state reconstructions show that HAPMs occur on the ancestral nodes of HP clusters, or on branches within HP clusters, but are not observed on LP branches that are ancestral to HP clusters (Supplementary Data 2, Supplementary Figs. 5–8 and Fig. 3). Therefore, given the phylogenetic resolution of our datasets, it is not possible to determine if HAPMs appear shortly before, during, or after the emergence of the HP phenotype. This limits our ability to determine if they are permissive or compensatory changes. The likely cause of this is a sampling bias towards HP isolates collected during outbreaks, resulting in an under-representation of the immediate LP ancestors of HP clusters. This conclusion is supported by the long branches leading to the emergence of some HP clusters, e.g. C6 H7NX and C3 H5NX (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). In general, the ML and the MCC phylogenies were consistent.Fig. 3: Reconstruction of amino acid evolution at selected HAPMs.Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees showing the reconstruction of ancestral states for four illustrative HAPMs (a−d). Branches are coloured according to the inferred ancestral amino acid states (tip states not shown). Nodes representing the immediate LP ancestors and nodes from which the HP clusters directly descend are shown with circles. The posterior probabilities for a given amino acid state occurring at the specified node are indicated. The HP sequences (HP clusters) are highlighted in orange, whilst the immediate ancestral LP sequences are highlighted in grey. For details on sampling date, location, and host species, see Supplementary Figs. 5–8.Full size imageFigure 3 illustrates the evolutionary dynamics of four selected HAPMs significantly associated with the HP phenotype. We observed high posterior probability values for ancestral amino acids at nodes preceding the emergence of HP clusters. By way of illustration, extensive parallel evolution is exhibited by mutation 143T in H7, which occurs in five HP clusters (Fig. 3a). Evolution at site 154 in H5 occurs within three HP clusters and exhibits a more complex, step-wise evolutionary process, from N to I/L to Q, reflecting a transition from LP to HP (Fig. 3b). N is present only in LP viruses, I/L occurs in HP viruses circulating prior to and during the early expansion of C8, and Q is only present in more recent HP viruses from C8. Examples of HAPMs occurring within internal genome segments are site 355 in H7NX PB2 and site 627 in H5NX PB2. Mutation 355K is present in HP clusters C5 and C6, but not in lineages representing the LP background (Fig. 3c). A similar pattern is seen for mutation 627K in the PB2 of H5NX viruses, present in C1 and C8, but now fixed among LP virus populations (Fig. 3d). For details on sampling date, location, and host species, see Supplementary Figs. 5–8.We further investigated if HAPMs that are significantly associated with the HP phenotype are also present in HP sequences that were not used in the subsampled alignments (Supplementary Data 3). We found that, in addition to the selected HP, mutation 154L in H5 was also fixed in two independent HP H5N1 outbreaks in Vietnam from 2008 to 2013 27, and in HP H5N2 viruses in China circulating from 2009 to 2015 28 (Supplementary Data 3). We also observed that mutation 143T is present in H7N6 viruses isolated from an outbreak in Aichi prefecture, Japan, in 2009 29 (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Data 1 and 3). Although this was not an HP outbreak, these viruses contained an additional arginine residue within the pCS (-PKGR to -PKRR), which triggered concerns about whether this lineage might evolve the HP phenotype. Fortunately, this lineage was successfully eradicated before any HP phenotype strains were observed29. The presence of HAPMs in these HP sequences constitute an independent test of our statistical approach.HAPMs associated with diversifying positive selectionAs parallel evolution is often a consequence of positive selection,14 we investigated whether some HAPMs were inferred as being positively selected sites (PSS; see ‘Methods’, subsection ‘Testing for diversifying positive selection’). Molecular evolutionary theory posits that most mutations within a coding sequence are expected to be deleterious, and are thus eliminated by purifying selection30. A smaller proportion of mutations are expected to be selectively neutral or nearly neutral, or beneficial, in which case they may be retained by directional or diversifying positive selection30. As expected for AIVs, and for RNA viruses in general16, dN/dS (ω) estimates for whole genome segments were <1 in all cases and the overall proportion of PSS detected was low (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Data 4).For all alignments, and under all methods, most codons exhibited ω ≪ 1 (strong purifying selection) or ω < 1 (weaker purifying selection or nearly neutral change). HA was the segment with the highest proportion of sites with ω > 1, but even in HA most codons had ω ≤ 1 (86% of codons for H5 and 92% of codons for H7),31. FUBAR revealed 458 codons evolving under episodic negative/purifying selection in H5, compared to five sites evolving under episodic positive/diversifying selection (posterior probability of ≥0.9). For H7, 417 sites were inferred to evolve under episodic negative/purifying selection, whilst zero sites were found to be under episodic positive/diversifying selection (posterior probability of ≥0.9).Analyses under branch-site models showed evidence for diversifying positive selection acting upon some HP clusters (H7NX clusters C4 and C7, and H5NX clusters C1, C2 and C4; Supplementary Table 1). Analyses under site models revealed for the H7NX subtype, 2/7 of the HAPMs significantly associated with the HP phenotype were identified as PSS. For the H5NX subtype, 2/10 of HAPMs were identified as PSS (see Supplementary Table 1 for details). At first impression, this suggests that most HAPMs significantly associated with the HP phenotype are not a consequence of positive selection14,17. However, some HAPMs may be selectively neutral in the absence of a pCS (LP phenotype), but offer a positive effect associated with a pCS (HP phenotype). Thus, they may not be inferred as a PSS using dN/dS methods, as these are rather conservative in detecting sites under positive selection in some circumstances32. For example, mutation E627K in PB2, which was not inferred to be a PSS, is known to have a positive effect on the adaptation of AIV to mammalian hosts and increases replication efficacy33. The role of selection on whole HP lineages is less clear: for example, experiments in turkey populations suggest that the HP and LP phenotypes of H7N1 viruses have indistinguishable transmission rates and basic reproductive numbers (R0)34.Inferring possible effects of HAPMs on protein structure and functionDespite experimental validations, we investigated HAPMS in the context of existing virus protein structures and the experimental literature on the potential functional significance of influenza A virus mutations. Most HAPMs had negative ddG values35, and thus predicted to represent fairly stabilisingeutral changes to protein structure and folding (Figs. 4 and 5). For the HA of the H7NX subtype (Fig. 4a), A143T in HA is a non-conservative amino acid change located in a solvent-accessible region within the 130-loop proximal to the receptor surface. This is within antigenic pocket A contributing to the electrostatic environment needed for ligand binding. Five antigenic regions (A−E) have been identified within antigenic pocket A for the A(H1N1) pdm09 virus, with site 143 located within five residues N-terminal to antigenic site A36. Although it has no direct interaction with glycans37, mutation A143T induces glycosylation of residue 141 by adding an N-linked glycosylation motif. This N-linked residue produces steric masking of the antigenic site and may affect HA folding and stability38. Other HAMPs with potential functional relevance for the H7NX subtype include M/L271I in HA, located within the receptor binding subdomain39,40, and R355K in PB2 (Fig. 4b), which is a conservative amino acid change within a solvent-exposed loop of the electrostatic surface of the cap binding domain. This site is in direct contact with first phosphate after the cap41 and correlates with high pathogenicity of AIVs in mouse models42.Fig. 4: Functional relevance of HAPMs of H7NX viruses.Protein structure models for the a HA (Hemagglutinin) and the b PB2/PB1 (Polymerase complex) of the H7NX viruses. Functionally relevant HAPMs are highlighted in red within the structural models. Only those HAMPs that are significantly associated with the HP phenotype are indicated. Estimated values for free energy change (ddG) are indicated for these sites. Negative values or those close to zero can be interpreted as fairly stabilisingeutral mutations with respect to protein structure.Full size imageFig. 5: Functional relevance of HAPMs of H5NX viruses.Protein structure models for the a HA (Hemagglutinin) and the b PB2 (Polymerase complex) of the H5NX viruses. See Fig. 4 legend for further details.Full size imageFor the HA of the H5NX subtype (Fig. 5a), HAMPs of potential functional relevance include mutation F127L in HA, which is a conservative amino acid change within the globular head of HA1 close to antigenic site 3 43. Similarly, mutation N154I/L/Q is a non-conservative change within antigenic site 2 and involves the loss of the asparagine-linked glycosylation site44. Both of these correspond to variable sites related to escape mutants43. However, they are not crucial for the protective efficacy of H5 vaccines, suggesting that the loss of the saccharide linkage may have little impact on antigenic variation40,44. I167T in HA is located in the surface-exposed region, and has been related to increased infectivity in the human lower respiratory tract in HP H5N1 viruses from Egypt45. S145L in HA is also located in the surface-exposed region and has been linked to increased virulence in poultry46. This site also undergoes occasional deletion (observed in ~10% of sequences) and it has been argued to be critical for the antigenic evolution of long-lived HPAIV clusters38. For the PB2 protein of H5NX viruses (Fig. 5b), the HAPM E627K is located within the surface-exposed region in in the ‘627 domain’, and is essential for viral RNA replication and transcription in a cellular context47. This mutation is a well-characterised host adaptation marker associated with enhanced transmission in mammalian hosts48; it is rarely observed among H5NX AIVs but appears frequently among zoonotic viruses that caused human infections7. E627K in H5NX PB2 is predicted to be destabilising for protein structure. However, it has been shown that other mutations in PB2, such as A674T (also scored as a HAPM), appear to improve the genetic stability of E627K49. Site 674 is located at the interface of the polymerase complex trimer and is predicted to increase strength of the PB2 protein structure48,49.DiscussionThe occurrence of HAPMs in AIV genomes can be used as a starting point for the identification of circulating variants associated with the HP phenotype. Here we report combined evolutionary and structural evidence to support the hypothesis that some HAPMs are significantly associated with the HP phenotype, and may facilitate the evolution of HP viruses. At present we can only hypothesise on the mechanism underlying these associations and whether they might have arisen due to epistasis, which is thought to be common in RNA viruses due to their limited genome sizes14. As an example of within-gene epistasis, oseltamivir resistance in human H1N1 influenza A viruses is conferred by mutation H274Y in N1, yet appears to have spread only under the genetic background of two permissive mutations (V234M and R222Q also in N1) that enable the virus to tolerate the detrimental effects of H274Y on protein structure stability18. Further, PB2 mutations E627K and A674T both scored as HAPMs and appear to epistatically interact: A674T counteracts the structural stability induced by E627K, whilst in vivo mouse models have shown that this mutation is a prerequisite for the acquisition of E627K, by stabilising polymerase activity49. Epistatic interactions among IAV genes are much less studied but have been proposed for genes of the IAV polymerase complex49,50.Previous studies have noted parallel genetic changes in independent AIV lineages51, but these were not linked to the emergence of the HP phenotype. One specific instance of parallel genetic change associated with the transition from an LP to an HP phenotype, giving rise to a single H7N1 HP outbreak in Italy, has been described52,53,54. We provide the first systematic and statistically rigorous screening for mutations in AIV genomes associated with HP outbreaks. We combine phylogenetically informed hypothesis testing with comparative evolutionary and structural approaches to identify a robust set of important mutations that could be experimentally evaluated in future analyses.Our statistical model for mutation−phenotype association reformulates the test of Bhattacharya et al.20 as an evolutionary-informed phylogenetic model that measures the strength of association between traits. Our test uses a probabilistic approach to account for the potential founder effects (e.g. hitchhiking events) that arise from shared common ancestry, whilst maximising the statistical power to detect associations. Our model shares similarities with some discrete trait evolution models55,56; however, these only consider two binary traits, whereas our test associates a binary trait (HP/LP) with multiple states (20 amino acids). Thus, our model captures the potential dependence between a trait and a target amino acid using a single parameter, rather than requiring a large number of parameters to represent each possible transition separately. This simplicity results in easily interpretable hypothesis testing, straightforward inference using maximum likelihood, and lower estimation variance. Available genomes for AIV are unlikely to be randomly sampled. The LP ancestors of many HP clusters will be under sampled, and some HP lineages may not be sampled at all. However, due to the phylogenetic nature of our tests, these sampling biases will lower our statistical power to detect HAPMs, but they will not introduce false positives. Therefore, our statistical approach is conservative (some associations will not be detected), but robust. Further, the simulations used to evaluate the performance of our statistical test take account for potential sampling bias (see Supplementary Text 5 for details). As we use a probabilistic approach, we expect our model will gain power as sampling of HP/LP viruses improves in the future.Mutations that increase the fitness of the HP phenotype, for example through permissive/compensatory effects, are expected to be favoured in a HP genetic background, and therefore occur repeatedly in HP lineages. Mutations that occur at nodes preceding the emergence of pCS-defined HP clusters (e.g. mutations that are present in the immediate LP ancestors and within a HP cluster) may represent permissive changes that facilitate the subsequent LP−HP evolutionary transition. Alternatively, mutations that occur immediately after the emergence of an HP cluster (after a pCS has arisen) may be more likely to be compensatory changes. Other statistical methods, such as that described in Kryazhimskiy et al.57, use a phylogenetically informed approach to detect positive epistasis between pairs of codons in the absence of prior biological information57. However, it will not inform on the timing of occurrence for sequential mutations, and thus will not provide information on whether changes are permissive or compensatory. A valid approach for estimating the timing of occurrence for sequential mutations is the reconstruction of ancestral states under a time-scaled analysis. However, we were not able to infer with sufficient resolution the relative timing of occurrence of most HAPMs under our time-scaled phylogenies, in part due to the longer branches leading to some of the HP clusters.Some of the HAPMs identified here were independently identified in other studies, either in vitro or in silico, as being functionally associated with the HP phenotype (Table 1)42,45,46,48,49,50. Nonetheless, even after our study, which was designed to be statistically conservative, it is likely that the number, biological roles, and genomic distribution of mutations involved in HP adaptation is underestimated. Notably, the HAPMs described here are not shared among the H7NX and H5NX virus subtypes, yet they commonly occur within the same genome segments (Table 1), suggesting that the evolution of the HP phenotype may interact with other well-studied biological processes, such as antigenic escape (determined by the HA protein) and the replication efficiency of viral genomes, e.g. at lower temperatures (regulated by PB2). Our findings are also in agreement with previous works proposing that the acquisition of a pCS may require coadaptation of the HA and other viral proteins58.Some of the mutations occurring close to antigenic sites may be indirectly associated with differential patterns of immunity in varied host populations, defined by complex factors such as animal age and sex distributions, previous exposure to infections/vaccines, or differences in host genetic diversity59. Interestingly, mathematical modelling has suggested that the sporadic population dynamics of HP strains may be determined, at least in part, by their linkage to one or more specific antigenic variants, whose frequencies are driven by the dynamics of host immunity, rather than by mutability24,60. Furthermore, the emergence of the HP phenotype has been often associated with virus adaptation from wild to domestic bird host populations51. The strength of this association is difficult to assess in nature given the substantial bias (in both the literature and sequence databases) towards AIV infections and HP outbreaks in poultry versus those in wild birds. However, using our model of mutation−trait association (see ‘Methods’, subsection ‘Testing for genotype-to-phenotype associations’ and Supplementary Text 5), we found no association between any of the detected HAMPs (or any other mutation) and the host species (domestic versus wild bird). This suggests that the parallel mutations identified here are not directly linked to transmission among domestic bird populations, although high population densities together with a limited genetic variability within the host (as occurs in intense farming) may facilitate virus transmission. If acquiring a pCS does indeed reduce AIV transmission fitness in natural systems34, then it is interesting to speculate that both intensive farming and the occurrence of secondary mutations (HAPMs) may independently act to facilitate the spread of an HP strain; the latter by potentially increasing the transmission fitness of strains carrying a pCS, and the former by lowering the threshold host density required to sustain transmission in a population.The results we present are derived from computational analysis and are thus strictly predictive. Thus, further experimental validations are needed to understand how the HAPMs actually contribute to the evolution of the HP phenotype, for example, by stabilising protein structure, altering host−virus or virus−virus inter-molecular interactions, or by combining additively to increase virulence. However, such experimental validation may take several years to complete especially if HP AIV gain-of-function experiments will be required61. In the meantime, we should continue to exploit fully the information revealed by parallel molecular evolution, which represents a powerful ‘natural’ replicated experiment. This situation further highlights the importance of systematic sampling and whole genome sequencing of both HP viruses and their immediate LP ancestors, both prior and during AIV outbreaks.Lastly, we propose that the set of HAPMs we predict to be associated with HP clusters selected here (or any improvement to this set obtained in the future), may, with sufficient validation and testing, function as an early detection system capable of highlighting lineages that pose a greater risk of evolving the HP phenotype in the future, and can function as a platform for future experimental validation. Importantly, the mutational panel identified here could benefit AIV control even before the mechanistic and functional actions of the mutations described are elucidated. We suggest that circulating AIV strains in domestic and wild bird populations that do not contain a pCS site, but which exhibit a combination of the HAPMs identified here, are potential targets for more focussed and targeted genomic and epidemiological surveillance.MethodsWe developed an analysis approach to detect parallel genetic changes associated with the LP-to-HP evolution of AIV (summarised in Fig. 1). For convenience, we refer to these parallel genetic changes as HAPMs (HP-cluster-associated parallel mutations). We begin by identifying HP clusters from large-scale AIV phylogenies. Next, we use phylogenetically informed subsampling to create smaller datasets suitable for detailed analysis. The subsampled alignments are then analysed using phylogenetic ancestral state reconstruction to identify convergent mutations that might be associated with HP clusters. Associations between the mutations identified and the HP phenotype (i.e. HAPMs) are formally tested under our model. The reduced list of HAPMs is further analysed to assess their potential functional and selective relevance using the following criteria: (i) evidence of evolving under positive selection, (ii) predicted to be stabilising to protein structure, and (iii) known or predicted functional relevance derived from structural analysis and literature survey. Finally, to explore whether HAPMs might be permissive or compensatory in nature, we assessed the temporal occurrence of mutation using a molecular clock analysis. Our analysis is explained below.Large-scale phylogenetic analysisWe downloaded from the Influenza Virus Database all available nucleotide sequences (>80,000 sequences) corresponding to complete AIV genome sets for the H7NX (n ≈ 3000) and H5NX (n ≈ 10,000) subtypes, from all hosts (excluding humans) and geographical regions. Genomes from non-avian hosts included mammals (mostly equine and swine influenza A viruses), environmentally derived sequences (usually from avian faecal sampling) and ND/NA (host species Not Determined/Not Available). Non-avian isolates comprise <15% of the large-scale datasets; most of them representing sporadic cross-species transmissions, with exception of the established equine H7NX lineage62. Sequences were excluded if (i) they were >200nt shorter than the full coding sequence length for each genome segment, (ii) they were identical, or (iii) they contained >10% ambiguities. The main eight ORFs (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, MS and NS) were identified and extracted. The number of H7NX ORFs were PB2 = 1856, PB1 = 1787, HA = 2217, PA = 1760, NP = 1513, M1 = 1682 and NS1 = 1231, and for the H5NX viruses were PB2 = 3554, PB1 = 3817, PA = 3421, HA = 5650, NP = 3230, M1 = 2824 and NS1 = 3690. Short ORFs for PB1-F2, PA-X, M2 and NS2 were excluded from analysis, as their short-length precluded the molecular evolutionary analyses undertaken here. For the NA segment, all available NA sequences were downloaded for both the H7NX and H5NX virus subtypes (1739 sequences for H7NX and 4202 for H5NX).Sequence datasets were aligned using MAFFT63 and preliminary large-scale phylogenies for each genome segment were estimated using RAxML under a general time reversible nucleotide substitution model with gamma-distributed among-site rate variation (GTR + G). Branch support was assessed using a bootstrap approach with 100 replicates64. We used the large-scale phylogenies to identify all HP lineages. HP strains were identified by (i) detecting >1 basic residue insertions within the consensus cleavage site in the HA protein alignments11 and (ii) by confirming HP status with case reports in the literature5,11. Sequences in other alignments were labelled HP/LP according to their status in the HA tree.Phylogenetically informed subsamplingTo render analyses computationally feasible, we subsampled the large-scale datasets in a phylogenetically informed manner. Firstly, clusters of HP sequences were further sub-selected under the following criteria: (i) they are monophyletic and well supported (bootstrap value > 80) in the large-scale phylogenies of HA and other genome segments, (ii) they contain >2 HP sequences for all genome segments, (iii) they have identifiable immediate LP ancestors, and (iii) they emerged independently from other HP clusters, and are thus distinct in time and space. Eight HP clusters were selected from 10 H5NX and 15 H5N1 previously identified HP lineages11, and nine HP clusters were selected from 24 H7NX HP lineages11. HP sequences were excluded from our analyses if they did not form well-supported clusters, had no identifiable immediate LP ancestors, or if sequences for all genome segments were not available. For LP sequences, subsampling was undertaken so as to retain the mutational pathways along internal tree branches that lead from LP ancestors to HP clusters, whilst reducing overall alignment sizes. All non-avian viruses were excluded from all subsampled alignments, as viruses the rate and nature of molecular evolution can vary in different hosts62.For the H7 and H5 HA datasets we retained (i) the selected HP clusters, (ii) their immediate LP ancestors in the tree, (iii) up to 250 randomly selected LP reference sequences to maintain overall tree topology, and (iv) a group of ancestral sequences for rooting purposes. In total, 313 sequences were sampled for H7 and H5 (Supplementary Data 1). For the NA datasets, we extracted all sequences corresponding to the NA types that are associated with the HP phenotype (for H7NX: N1 = 136 sequences, N3 = 367, N7 = 196 and N9 = 18, and for H5NX: N1 = 2053 subsampled to 200, N2 = 367, N7 = 757, N3 = 78, N8 = 93 and N9 = 223). We then merged the individual NA subtype alignments to create two global NA alignments (for H7NX: NX = 919 and for H5NX: NX = 1146 subsampled to 600). Finally, to illustrate the genetic diversity of NA, we extracted from the large-scale datasets all NA sequences of the isolates present in the HA subsampled alignments (211 for H7NX and 150 for H5NX) (Supplementary Fig. 4).AIVs of different subtypes undergo genome reassortment, especially within the internal segments23. In order to account for this, when inferring the evolutionary history of internal genes, we used a single phylogeny/alignment that includes all AIV subtypes (not just viruses belonging to the H5 and H7 subtypes). In this way, we maximise our chances of including those phylogenetic nodes that are closely related LP ancestors to HP clusters, irrespective of AIV subtype. This procedure aims to (i) reduce estimation error, (ii) increase accuracy of phylogeny reconstruction, and (iii) ensure the most closely related strains to each HP lineage are included. Consequently, for each internal segment (PB2, PB1, PA, NP M1, NS1), we constructed a consensus sequence for each HP cluster and used blastn to identify closely related sequences belonging all AIV subtypes other than H5NX and H7NX, and retained the top ten hits for each search. Sequences from these hits were added to the merged internal segment datasets (both the H5NX and H7NX viruses, including the selected HP strains). The resulting final number of sequences in each internal segment dataset was: PB2 = 514, PB1 = 541, PA = 485, NP = 503, M1 = 443 and NS1 = 471.Each dataset was re-aligned using MAFFT63 and alignments were screened for recombination using the RDP, GENECOV and BOOTSCAN components of the RDP3 package65. No evidence for intra-segment recombination was detected by three or more methods under a Bonferroni-corrected p value < 0.001. The subsampled alignments were analysed using jModelTest2 to identify well-fitting substitution models66. For each alignment, trees were estimated using RAxML under the GTR + G model and bootstrapped with 100 replicates64. Prior to tree estimation, HA alignments were edited to remove the cleavage site, whilst regions with poor alignment scores were removed from the NA alignments. Alignment sizes for the subsampled datasets are provided in Supplementary Data 1. The varying sizes and/or missing HP clusters in some alignments are due to the lack of complete genomes for all strains in the public database.Detecting candidate HAPMs co-occurring across HP clustersTo identify candidate HAPMs within AIV genomes, all mutations (deletions, insertions and non-synonymous variable sites) present in ≥1% of the sequences in each subsampled alignment were coded as a discrete taxon trait and subjected to ancestral state reconstruction on the subsampled RAXML trees, using the maximum likelihood framework implemented in the ‘ape’ R package67. The resulting reconstructions were inspected visually to identify candidate HAPMs shared by multiple HP clusters, indicating convergent evolution within the HP phenotype. We identified sites as candidate HAPMs if: (i) they occurred within two or more HP clusters, (ii) they were present in >60% of the sequences within the HP clusters (i.e. the mutation is dominant within a given HP population), and (iii) they were absent from internal nodes that do not lead to HP lineages. Thus, candidate HAPMS may occur on LP terminal branches across the phylogenies, but are not generally fixed within LP lineages (Supplementary Data 2).Testing for genotype-to-phenotype associationsWe developed an evolutionary model to statistically test for associations between binary phenotypic traits and amino acid states in a phylogenetically informed manner. Our method serves the same purpose as a χ2 test, but correctly incorporates the phylogenetic history of the trait and phenotype of interest; failing to account for these phylogenetic correlations can lead to erroneous false positives20,68. The model assumes that phenotypes and amino acid states are discrete traits that change along the phylogeny. Given an alignment, its phylogeny, and a set of binary values for each sequence, the method tests if a specific amino acid state (candidate HAPM) is associated with the HP phenotype. This is repeated for all amino acid states and all codons. The coupling parameter λ is used to measure the strength of association between an amino acid state and the phenotype state. The null hypothesis of zero association is represented by λ = 1, and can be rejected in favour of a positive association (λ > 1) using a likelihood ratio test (LRT). The type I and II error rates of this test were evaluated using simulations. We applied this test to our subsampled alignments and used it to select those mutations that are significantly associated with the HP phenotype, thus classifying them as HAPMs. To avoid overrepresentation of the long-lived H5N1 HP viruses22, the lineage was further reduced in size by collapsing it to its most basal sequences. A full mathematical description of the model and simulation details are provided in Supplementary Text 5.To explore if the detected HAPMs might represent permissive or compensatory change, we performed a time-scaled analysis coupled with reconstruction of ancestral states using BEAST v1.8.4 69. The temporal signal in all RAxML trees was assessed using TempEst v.1.5, by plotting root-to-tip genetic distance against sampling time70. As expected, this showed strong temporal signal in all trees, suggesting a strict molecular clock is adequate for these data. From the subsampled alignments, we estimated the posterior probability of amino acid states occurring at tree nodes that are ancestral and immediate to HP clusters, using a discrete trait evolution model. For this, time-scaled phylogenies were estimated using a SRD06 nucleotide substitution model, a strict molecular clock model and a Bayesian skyline coalescent tree prior69. Partitions were generated for each site, and ancestral statesransition rates for each mutation of interest were estimated using an asymmetric continuous time Markov chain model71. Two MCMC runs were computed for 100 × 106 states until convergence was reached. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were summarised using TreeAnnotator after removing 10% of the runs as burn-in69. Finally, we note that the presence of HAPMs in HP viruses that were not included in the subsampled alignments could be used to test our analysis pipeline. Therefore, to determine if selected HAPMs were present in these HP sequences, we re-estimated the full mutational history of HAPMs by mapping amino acid changes onto the tips of the large-scale ML phylogenies generated in step 1 (Supplementary Data 3).Testing for diversifying positive selectionThe dN/dS ratio (also denoted ω) is the ratio of non-synonymous substitution rate per non-synonymous site to the synonymous substitution rate per synonymous site. It measures the selective pressures acting on a protein coding sequence72. Site-specific models (M1a/M2a in CODEML73 and SLAC, FEL and MEME in Datamonkey74) estimate the proportion of codons that are evolving under purifying selection (ω < 1), nearly neutraleutral evolution (ω = 1), and diversifying positive selection (ω > 1). Branch-site models (BSaBSA in CODEML and bsREL in Datamonkey) allow ω to vary along both branches and among sites simultaneously, making it possible to identify lineages and specific codons that have evolved under positive selection through time73,74. In all cases, nested models are tested using the χ2 approximation to the LRT statistic, and are further subjected to Bonferroni multiple correction for multiple testing.Using the site-specific models, we calculated the proportion of sites evolving in each ω category and noted if candidate HAPMs were identified as PSS. We used the branch-site models to detect positively selected HP clusters and associated mutations. The subsampled alignments for each genome segment were used in the analyses, except for the mixed NA subtype alignments (Supplementary Table 1). Since different dN/dS-based methods differ in their statistical performance and on the framework used for parameter estimation72,75, we undertook a conservative approach and only report sites or HP cluster as being positively selected if they were identified as such by at least two different methods (see Supplementary Table 1). Finally, the output of the DEPS algorithm38 was compared with our results, and the proportions of codons in each evolutionary class were confirmed using the FUBAR method31. The LRT results and lists of all PSS identified using CODEML are provided in Supplementary Data 4.Inferring mutation effects on protein stability and functionFrequently, mutations that may render beneficial phenotypes may also be deleterious at a molecular level, by altering protein structural or folding stability35. We therefore undertook structural analyses to predict, based on existing structural data and the literature, if the HAPMs identified in previous steps could have possible implications for protein structure and stability, and/or have any potential functional impacts (see references in Table 1). We modelled protein 3D structures from existing structural data in the PDB database (https://pdb101.rcsb.org/), using representative HP sequences from our datasets as queries. For H7, we used the crystal structure of isolate A/H7N2/New York/107/2003 AIV (PDB ID 3M5G), whilst for H5 we used the crystal structure of isolate A/Vietnam/30262III/04 AIV (PDB ID For the PB2/PB1/PA complex), the high-resolution structure of the A/H5N1/duck/Fujian/01/2002 virus (PDB 6QPF) was used as a template76. For all structures, we used the I-TASSER server77 to generate models with the mutations of interest, which were visually compared to PDB files for validation. Finally, to predict which HAPMs might possible affect the stability of protein structures, we used the PIPS (Phylogenetic Inference of Protein Stability) program35. This program implements an informed Bayesian approach and estimates, for each amino acid state, a value of free energy change (ddG) in terms of the thermodynamic stability of an unfoldingefolding protein. A statistical model is used to calculate the probability of free energy change along phylogeny branches in a manner analogous to the computation of nucleotide substitution models, and thereby computationally predict the occurrence of mutations altering protein stability35. Negative ddG values are predicted to be stabilising for protein structure. Values close to zero are predicted to have little effect or to be only weakly stabilising, whilst positive values are predicted to destabilise protein structure35.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Share this item with your network: By Jessica Kent Published: 04 Nov 2020 A predictive analytics system was able to use location data to foresee flu outbreaks, outperforming other state-of-the-art forecasting tools with an eleven percent increase in accuracy. The tool, developed by researchers at Stevens Institute of Technology, can find patterns in the way influenza infections flow from one region to another, and use patterns identified in one region to inform predictions in other locations. The team trained the predictive analytics algorithm using real-world state and regional data from the US and Japan. Researchers then tested the model’s forecasts against historical flu data. While other models can use past data to forecast flu outbreaks a week or two ahead of time, incorporating location data enables much more accurate predictions over a period of several months. With the incorporation of location data, the tool can predict influenza outbreaks up to 15 weeks in advance. The team also used a graph neural network to encode flu infections as interconnected regional clusters. This enables the algorithm to uncover patterns in infections in different places. “Capturing the interplay of space and time lets our mechanism identify hidden patterns and predict influenza outbreaks more accurately than ever before,” said Yue Ning, an associate professor of computer science at Stevens Institute of Technology. “By enabling better resource allocation and public health planning, this tool will have a big impact on how we cope with influenza outbreaks.” The team also noted that the model’s predictions are explainable to humans, a critical feature for artificial intelligence in healthcare. “Our model is also extremely transparent — where other AI forecasts use ‘black box’ algorithms, we’re able to explain why our system has made specific predictions, and how it thinks outbreaks in different locations are impacting one another,” Ning said. Researchers noted that going forward, similar techniques could be used to predict COVID-19 surges. Although COVID-19 is a novel virus and there is no historical data to train an AI algorithm, the team pointed out that large amounts of COVID-19 location-coded data are being collected on a regular basis. “That could allow us to train algorithms more quickly as we continue to study the COVID-19 pandemic,” Ning said. The team is now working to incorporate additional data sources into the model to improve influenza predictions. However, accounting for current public health interventions such as vaccination education, mask-wearing, and social distancing has proven to be a challenge. “It’s complicated, because health policies are enacted in response to outbreak severity, but also shape the course of those outbreaks,” Ning explained. “We need more research to learn about how health policies and pandemics interact.” The team has also had to discover which data elements are truly helpful for predicting flu outbreaks and which are not. “We’re also constrained by the information that’s publicly available,” Ning said. “Having location-coded data on vaccination rates would be very helpful, but sourcing that information isn’t easy.” The researchers expect that the tool will be a valuable asset in real-world health planning. “Our algorithm will keep learning and improving as we collect new data, allowing us to deliver even more accurate long-term predictions,” Ning said. “As we work to cope with future pandemics, these technologies will have a big impact.” With the COVID-19 pandemic coinciding with flu season, researchers have sought to leverage advanced analytics tools to better predict flu trends in the US. In March 2020, a team from UMass Amherst developed a portable surveillance tool that leverages machine learning and real-time data to monitor flu-like illnesses and patterns. The device can detect coughing sounds and crowd size in real time, helping to forecast seasonal viral outbreaks. “Our main goal was to build predictive models at the population level, not the individual level,” said Tauhidur Rahman, assistant professor of computer and information sciences and co-author of the study. “I thought if we could capture coughing or sneezing sounds from public spaces where a lot of people naturally congregate, we could utilize this information as a new source of data for predicting epidemiologic trends.” Next Steps 3 Ways Healthcare is Using Predictive Analytics to Combat COVID-19How Predictive Analytics, Patient IDs Can Improve the Care ExperienceWeb-Based Predictive Analytics Identifies COVID-19 Hot Spots Related Resources Top 12 Ways Artificial Intelligence Will Impact Healthcare –TechTarget Teradata LinkedIn Live: The Disruptive Economics of AI –Video Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare –Talk Dig Deeper on Artificial intelligence in healthcare AMA updates CPT code set for avian influenza vaccines By: Jacqueline LaPointe WHO identifies first bird flu death in 59-year-old man By: Veronica Salib Managing bird flu risks with advances in prevention CDC unveils wastewater dashboard to track the spread of H5N1 bird flu Sponsored News A Generative AI Use Case Brought to Life with Solutions from Dell Technologies –Dell Technologies and Intel AI & Healthcare: Truth Behind the Buzz and a Path Forward –Greenway Health Key elements of effective member incentive programs –Zelis Healthcare See More Related Content Managing bird flu risks with advances in prevention – Pharma Life Sciences Predictive Model Illustrates Transmissibility of ... – Healthtech Analytics Machine Learning Tool Uses Real-Time Data to Monitor ... – Healthtech Analytics Latest TechTarget resources Health IT Healthtech Security Healthcare Payers Pharma Life Sciences xtelligent Health IT and EHR How generative AI in healthcare is helping cut admin burden Over 90% of healthcare workers feel optimistic about the promise of generative AI in healthcare to alleviate administrative ...

Back to Healio Approved influenza vaccination exemption requests increased significantly over 3 years among health care personnel at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, according to study findings published in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology. Most requests — four out of every five — “were explicitly religious in nature,” researchers reported. Influenza vaccination exemption requests increased significantly over three influenza seasons among health care personnel at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Credit: Adobe Stock “Our experience with the development and implementation of a process to review health care personnel requests for exemption from our institutional influenza vaccination requirement results in some rich and robust learnings,” Tom Talbot, MD, MPH, professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and chief hospital epidemiologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told Healio. “As we looked in the literature, we could not find many studies that provided a comprehensive review of the exemption review process, its development and the complex reasons that health care personnel (HCP) claimed for such exemptions,” Talbot said. “It was our hope that sharing our experience could help other institutions who may be struggling with how to evaluate these exemption requests.” Tom Talbot Talbot and colleagues analyzed all personal and religious exemption requests at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) for three consecutive influenza seasons between 2015 and 2018. According to the study, the researchers categorized the requests by one of 12 standardized employee categories and one of 18 unique reasons for vaccine exemption. The study demonstrated that among the three influenza seasons, 1.1% to 2.1% of all VUMC HCP requested religious or personal exemption from vaccination. According to the study, the frequency of religious and personal exemption approval increased annually from 65.5% to 80.2% to 87.6% over the three seasons. The researcher said the five most commonly stated reasons for not getting vaccinated were religious in nature, with the most common being that the “body is a temple or sacred.” These requests were most often submitted by nonclinical staff. “While the proportion of health care workers who request a religious or personal belief exemption from an employer influenza vaccination mandate is very low, a multidisciplinary process to review such requests in a fair and consistent manner is important,” Talbot said.

"There's a lot we don't know yet, but we can look to the past flu seasons to learn more about what we can expect." Watch the video for the full story. Q: When should I go to the emergency department if I have the flu? A: You should only go to the emergency department if you are extremely sick, have a high fever, are short of breath and can't catch your breath, are turning blue around your lips, and are extremely confused. Otherwise, try to stay home and call your primary care doctor. Q: What are the symptoms of the flu? A: The main symptoms of the flu are having a fever, cough, being short of breath, having some muscle aches, and being fatigued. Q: How do I tell if I have the flu or COVID-19? A: The symptoms of both influenza and COVID-19 are similar, but one of the symptoms that is frequently seen in COVID-19 but not influenza is a change or loss in sense of smell or taste. We should also be able to tell you if you have a cold, COVID-19 or influenza based on rapid testing available through your primary care doctor. Q: What are the side effects of the flu shot? A: A little discomfort in your shoulder, but that's about it. Q: Why does the flu go away in the summer? A: The flu is present year-round, but flu rates are higher in the winter due to people spending more time in close spaces and closer to one another. Q: If I got the flu shot last year do I have to get it again? A: The benefit of getting the flu vaccine annually is the protection you build-up to the various strains of the virus. The vaccine isn’t 100% accurate, but after getting it annually, you’ll have a degree of protection if there are similar strains in the following years. Q: Is it safe to get a flu shot if I've had coronavirus? A: Absolutely, and we strongly recommend that you get the flu shot if you had COVID-19 because your immune system is likely weaker. Q: If I get the influenza shot this year will I be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine? A: The current recommendation is that once a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, people wait at least 30 days in between getting the influenza vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine.

From: Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Food Standards Agency, Public Health England and Animal and Plant Health Agency Published 2 November 2020 This was published under the 2019 to 2022 Johnson Conservative government This news article was withdrawn on 7 November 2022 This page is out of date and has been archived. Find out about the latest bird flu situation in England. Avian influenza of the H5N2 strain has been confirmed in at a small commercial premises near Deal in Kent today (2 November). All 480 birds on site will be humanely culled to limit the spread of the disease. A 1km Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) Restricted Zone has also been put in place around the infected farm to limit the risk of the disease spreading. The advice from Public Health England (PHE) is that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency has made clear that bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. Thoroughly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat. Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said: Avian flu has been confirmed at a small commercial premises in Kent. Immediate steps have been taken to limit the risk of the disease spreading and all remaining poultry and captive birds at the farm will be culled. Public Health England has confirmed that the risk to public health is very low and the Food Standards Agency has said that bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. There will be no impact on food supply as this business does not supply poultry meat or eggs to the commercial food chain. Bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises. We are urgently looking for any evidence of disease spread associated with this farm to control and eliminate it. Dr Gavin Dabrera, Consultant in Acute Respiratory Infections at PHE, said: Avian influenza remains an uncommon infection in humans and the risk to the UK population remains very low – we will continue working with Defra and the local Health Protection Team to monitor the situation closely. Do not touch any sick or dead birds and make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap after contact with any animal. A Food Standards Agency spokesperson said: The Food Standard Agency advises that, on the basis of the current scientific evidence, this strain of avian influenza does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. The wider risk posed by avian influenzas through the food chain is very low. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, remain safe to eat. A detailed investigation is in progress to determine the most likely source of this outbreak. Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. There are some simple measures that all poultry keepers, whether they are running a large commercial farm, keeping a few hens in their back garden, or rearing game birds, should take to protect their birds against the threat of avian flu. These include: Keeping the area where birds live clean and tidy, controlling rats and mice and regularly cleansing and disinfecting any hard surfaces Cleaning footwear before and after visits Placing birds’ feed and water in fully enclosed areas that are protected from wild birds, and removing any spilled feed regularly Putting fencing around outdoor areas where birds are allowed and limiting their access to ponds or areas visited by wild waterfowl Where possible, avoid keeping ducks and geese with other poultry species. The UK has remained free of highly pathogenic avian influenza since September 2017. A low pathogenic H5N3 strain of the disease, which poses no threat to human health, returned in December 2019 and was quickly dealt with by Government action. The UK declared itself free from avian influenza H5N3 in June. Further information on how to help prevent the spread of the disease can be found here.

(WCHS/WVAH) — There is a brand new COVID-19 testing option that is now available in the Charleston area.While it's not common, it should prove useful with flu season upon us.COVflu-19 is Mako Medical Laboratories' latest test. It has the ability to detect three viral infections from one swab, according to Mako Medical Executive Director of West Virginia Ryan Nibert."It detects Influenza A and B and COVID-19," Nibert said.The three-in-one test took about three months to develop and isn't common in the area just yet."This test is not common, Mako actually developed this test. So you may see respiratory panels that can test for very similar viruses, but they are going to be a lot longer turnaround time. A lot of labs may be coming out with a similar test, but to my knowledge, in this area, this is the only test like it," Nibert said.The test will benefit many, including sports teams and schools. For Charleston Area Medical Center Memorial Hospital nurse Josh Mays, he's behind the new test."It's kind of strange going to get my flu shot while we’re also battling this pandemic. It’s a unique situation and I think it’s still important to take the precautions," he said. "It sounds good. I mean who doesn’t like a one-stop-shop? I go to Walmart and get some bacon, and a T-shirt, and I get parts for my car, same concept."For those who want to get a COVflu-19 test, Nibert says you can go to the Mako Medical lab off MacCorkle Avenue and ask for the COVflu-19 test.Stay ConnectedLike UsFollow Ussbg-envelopeNewsletter Sign up /sign-up© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.TermsWCHSWCHSWCHSWVAHWVAHWVAHPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesLoading ...Only 56 percent of people intend to have free flu vaccination in the U.K. amid COVID Skip to content Menu Medical Home Life Sciences Home Become a Member Search Medical Home Life Sciences Home About COVID-19 News Health A-Z Drugs Medical Devices Interviews White Papers More...

Laguipo, BSNNov 2 2020 Amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the northern hemisphere is fast approaching winter, which will increase influenza cases. Health experts are urging people to get flu shots. Flu vaccination is an important way to reduce the burden on the health system since it has over ten months since the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. While the first wave of the pandemic missed most of the flu season in Europe and the United States, a second COVID wave is likely to overlap with the 2020–2021 season. Healthcare systems come under substantial strain during a typical flu season, which would be compounded if there is an increase in COVID-19 cases this year. Now, a team of researchers at Keele University and Public Health England aimed to determine how many residents in the U.K. intend to get flu shots amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers found that 55.8 percent of people intended to have the vaccination. Study: Intention to have seasonal influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic among eligible adults in the UK. Image Credit: KPG_Payless / Shutterstock This news article was a review of a preliminary scientific report that had not undergone peer-review at the time of publication. Since its initial publication, the scientific report has now been peer reviewed and accepted for publication in a Scientific Journal. Links to the preliminary and peer-reviewed reports are available in the Sources section at the bottom of this article. View Sources The study The study, which appeared as a preprint on the medRxiv* server, estimated the number of people willing to get vaccinated against influenza in preparation for winter. The team recruited a nationally representative sample of 1,500 adults in the United Kingdom through Prolific’s online research panel. The participants were asked to complete a survey asking sociodemographic profiles, clinical questions, COVID-19, and possible COVID-19 vaccination. About 645 participants are eligible for the vaccination. Of these, more than half said they intend to get the flu shots. Previous research suggests that increasing uptake of the flu vaccine may help contain the COVID-19 outbreak. Hence, steps to help everyone to pursue their intention is crucial. Further, the team asked the participants if they received a flu shot in the previous year and how likely they would be to have the flu shot this year. Of the 514 eligible respondents who showed a clear intention to get a flu shot, 60.6 percent reported having the shot last winter, while 39.4 percent said they were not vaccinated. Related StoriesUniversal flu vaccine candidate provides protection against severe infection in animal modelsNew CDC report highlights disparities in flu hospitalization and vaccinationStudy reveals how COVID-19 affected the spread and evolution of seasonal influenzaThe study findings strongly suggest that those who received the flu vaccine the previous year are likely to intend to have it again this year. However, vaccination intention in these individuals eligible for the vaccine was higher than the reported uptake last year. This may mean that the uptake this year may be lower than those who said they intend to get the shots. Therefore, health agencies and governments need to exert efforts to convert positive intentions into behavior. Proper messaging, information dissemination, and vaccine delivery should ensure that these individuals receive the vaccine, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic has left many people locked down in their homes. Some people also fear going to hospitals or clinics to get flu shots due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Increasing uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine in a timely fashion will relieve pressure on the service. If this is to be successful, strategies to achieve this increase need to be implemented now,” the researchers concluded in the study. The flu season and COVID-19 The skyrocketing cases of COVID-19 across the globe, especially in countries reporting the second wave of outbreaks, may take a toll on healthcare systems. Many hospitals are maxing out their bed capacities to accommodate coronavirus cases. With the flu season coming, it is expected that hospitalizations may increase. With two diseases ravaging the globe, hospitals may lack the human resources and facility to cater to all patients. Hence, preventing flu illness, which may also lead to hospitalizations in high-risk populations, is essential. Flu vaccination in the United Kingdom mostly occurs from December to March every year, with the national vaccination program starting in September. The vaccination is free via the NHS to children between two and eleven years old, adults who are more than 65 years old, pregnant women, healthy workers, and people at high risk of flu complications.

Doctors and experts recommend influenza shots and then pneumonia vaccine to boost immunity, though they guarantee no protection against the Covid-19 virus. Two recent studies from Italy conclude that coronavirus rates among people older than 65, who had received a flu shot, were comparatively less.Each year, several flu vaccines come on the market. Currently, seven are commercially available and recommended for clinical use in 2020-2021. Note, the vaccine you’re taking must be licensed and age-specific. Trivalent vaccines (IIV, RIV4, or LAIV4), which typify the majority of vaccines this year, protect the body against three strains of viruses while quadrivalent protects against four. Flu vaccines fall into seven categories. 1. Standard dose trivalent flu shots (18-64 years) 2. High-dose trivalent shots 3. Standard dose quadrivalent flu shots (six months and older) 4. High-dose quadrivalent shots that contain four times the flu antigen5. Trivalent and quadrivalent shots containing the immunity-boosting adjuvant (65 years and older) 6. Jet injection 7 Recombinant quadrivalent shots (18 years and older). There is a nasal spray too which isn’t advised for pregnant women. The standard-dose flu shot can be given to ages six months and older. Flu shots reduce the risk of flu-associated hospitalisation for children, working-age adults and older people. “They can help combat lung disease, chronic asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis and reduce the chances of pneumonia-related hospitalisation by 43 percent,” says Dr S Suresh, Associate Consultant, Institute of Pulmonary Critical Care Medicine and Lung Transplantation, Gleneagles Global Health City, Chennai. Consult your doctor which vaccine is most suitable.“It takes about two weeks to develop enough antibodies from the flu vaccine to protect you against the flu,” says Dr Lakshmy Menon, Consultant Neonatologist and Pediatrician, Cloudnine Group of Hospitals, Bengaluru. Good to Know✥ An influenza vaccine costs about `1,250 and the pneumonia shot is around `1,000-1,500 depending on the manufacturer ✥Inform the doctor if you are suffering from an active infection like fever, sore throat or any long-term illnesses. If you have egg allergy ask for a recombinant injection .·✥Stay well hydrated before getting the shot.Side effectsFlu vaccine: Fever and cold like symptoms can be expected when given to children. Usually mild side effects like pain on the injection site, redness, swelling and low- grade fever are seen.Pneumococcal vaccine: Injection site reaction like hardness, pain, fever, headache, rashes can emerge.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestPneumonia vaccineShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

The war had monopolized Wilsonâs attention during his second term in office, to the point that he wouldnât even acknowledge the 1918 influenza pandemicÂ (often referred to as the Spanish flu at that time), which killed nearly 700,000 Americans. As John M. Barry, author of The Great Influenza, told TIME, âanything negative was viewed as hurting morale and hurting the war effort.âShortly after arriving in Paris, Wilson caught the flu.Not Just a Common ColdBehind closed doors at the HÃ´tel du Prince Murat, the situation was grave. The president lay in bed, wracked with coughing fits, diarrhea, and high fever, while his staff tried to make sense of his delirious rantings. As chief usher Irwin Hoover recalled, they simply couldnât convince Wilson that the hotel was not, as he insisted, teeming with French spies.âAbout this time he also acquired a peculiar notion he was personally responsible for all the property in the furnished place he was occupying,â Hoover said. (Apparently, Smithsonian reports, Wilson thought some furniture had gone missing, though it hadnât moved at all.) âComing from the President, whom we all knew so well, these were very funny things, and we could but surmise that something queer was happening in his mind.âIn a letter to Wilsonâs private secretary, Joseph Tumulty, White House physician Cary T. Grayson explained that the illness was so sudden and severe that he âwas at first suspicious that [Wilsonâs] food had been tampered with.â While Grayson admitted to Tumulty that the president had indeed contracted the âtreacherousâ influenzaâand that he was anxious about the president's conditionâthe doctor wasnât nearly as forthcoming with the American people.Woodrow Wilson with Cary T. Grayson on his left, circa 1918. / Harris & Ewing Collection, Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division // No Know Restrictions on PublicationNewspapers published frequent updates on Wilsonâs convalescence, citing Graysonâs steady reassurances that their unshakeable leader was merely suffering from a cold, which was âno cause for worry.â The White House also implied that Wilson himself was somehow uniquely equipped to defeat the disease, since he âalways throws off the deepest colds quickly.âLasting Effects and Last WordsWilson did manage to throw off the virus, saving Grayson and the rest of the administration from having to come clean about the deception. But some people believe that the illness might have affected the outcome of the Paris Peace Conference.As The New Yorker reported earlier this year, Wilson had wanted leniency for Germany in order to foster world peace and diplomacy. Britain and France, on the other hand, were pushing for harsher consequencesâsteep debt, loss of land, and French occupation in the Rhineland. The leaders were in the midst of an ongoing, heated debate when Wilson fell ill, and once he had recovered enough to resume the discussion, he quickly caved to their terms. Though we canât say with any certainty that Wilsonâs bout of influenza was related to his about-face, it is possible that it weakened his reserve.The "Big Four" leaders at the Paris Peace Conference in May 1919. From left to right: Britain's David Lloyd George, Italy's Vittorio Orlando, France's Georges Clemenceau, and Woodrow Wilson. / Bain News Service Photograph Collection, Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division // No Known Restrictions on PublicationIt also may have weakened his health overall. In October of that same year, Wilson nearly died from a stroke, which caused partial blindness and partial paralysis on his left side. Again, the details were kept from the public, and Wilson continued to preside over the country with some major help from his wife, Edith, until the end of his term in 1921.Wilson still never addressed the 1918 flu pandemic, but his last sentence is a confirmation that he at least knew how it felt to experience the kind of total physical deterioration that a virus like the 1918 flu can cause. âI am a broken piece of machinery,â Wilson said before his death in 1924. âWhen the machinery is brokenâI am ready.âHome / PRESIDENTSABOUTCONTACT USNEWSLETTERSPRIVACY POLICYCOOKIE POLICYTERMS OF SERVICEACCESSIBILITY STATEMENTSITEMAPA-Z IndexCookie PreferencesÂ© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights ReservedA decision support framework for prediction of avian influenza | Scientific Reports Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

The emergence and spread of avian influenza virus have been uncertain and sudden. The virus is likely to spread through several pathways such as poultry transportation and wild bird migration. The complicated and global spread of avian influenza calls for surveillance tools for timely and reliable prediction of disease events. These tools can increase situational awareness and lead to faster reaction to events. Here, we aimed to design and evaluate a decision support framework that aids decision makers by answering their questions regarding the future risk of events at various geographical scales. Risk patterns were driven from pre-built components and combined in a knowledge base. Subsequently, questions were answered by direct queries on the knowledge base or through a built-in algorithm. The evaluation of the system in detecting events resulted in average sensitivity and specificity of 69.70% and 85.50%, respectively. The presented framework here can support health care authorities by providing them with an opportunity for early control of emergency situations.

Moreover, the epidemics of avian influenza remain a major threat to animal and human health, highlighting the need for the development of tools that assist in decision making. Surveillance and prediction of avian influenza emergence can help in responding to infectious disease emergencies by providing advance knowledge of the location, timing and intensity of disease events. Events are defined as unusual events that might signal an outbreak2. Advance knowledge provided by surveillance systems assists policy makers in selecting appropriate measures to contain virus spread. Given the complexity of disease introduction and transmission mechanisms, studies have usually considered different aspects of information. However, there is a small group of epidemiological studies that use decision making methodologies involving multiple factors, options and data sources3.There have been efforts to explore the critical risk factors for avian influenza infection, such as environmental dynamics, wild bird migratory routes, bird trade routes, and water or rice lands4,5,6. The most important risk factors have been recognized and used to build forecasting models including spatiotemporal visualisation, time-series, and data mining models. These models could facilitate the process of decision making by predicting the time and location of epidemics. In addition, social media, search engines, and news contents have been used as an alternative to official records of infectious diseases7,8,9. Digital sources of data have been used to monitor the spatial spread of disease as time progresses. The insights from digital surveillance systems may support decision makers by providing them with early warnings of epidemics.Decision support system (DSS)Decision support systems can assist policy makers to take effective management decisions for containment of infectious disease outbreaks. Broadly speaking, a DSS is a digital system that assists in the process of making decisions10. A traditional DSS is defined as a system that supports managerial decisions in semi-structured situations, which aims to enhance the ability of decision makers, rather than replace their opinion10. A traditional DSS is, generally, composed of: databases that are managed by a database management system, a model management that provides quantitative models with analytical capabilities, and a graphical user interface (GUI) or a dashboard11.Additionally, over time, DSSs have evolved to more sophisticated systems known as knowledge-based DSS. Knowledge-based systems make use of a variety of models, including artificial intelligence12. In fact, a knowledge-based system is not only a repository for rules, but it is also a tool to deliver intelligent decisions by utilizing data mining and artificial intelligence methods10. A typical knowledge-based DSS includes five main components, namely: data, model, knowledge base, interface engine and user interface.Typically, systems that have been designed to assist decision makers in the field of infectious disease range from online information systems13 to model-driven systems14,15 and machine learning based systems16,17. The information system introduced by Li and colleagues13 exploited mobile and wireless infrastructures to facilitate the collection, exchange, and visualization of information. The extracted information then could be queried and analyzed by experts in the field to make proper decisions. The next group of systems, have used statistical simulation models to provide required information for experts14,15. In this type of systems, experts can classify or cluster the information or they can search the parameter space to find an optimum control scenario. In the last group of DSSs16,17,18, machine learning algorithms and online analytical processing of data (OLAP) have been utilized in order to extract useful knowledge. The outcome knowledge can then assist in identifying the future geotemporal occurrence of disease and potentially containment policy making.Knowledge fusion is an effective method to enhance the efficiency of a decision support system19. In several studies, data from various domains have been combined to gain more detail and reliable information on disease patterns16,18,20. In a study by Chae et al.18, it was shown that deep learning methods perform much better than time-series approaches for predicting infectious diseases 1 week into the future. The analysis was applied to big data including social media, environmental factors, search queries and disease occurrence data. The study by Chae and colleagues concluded that deep learning models can reduce the reporting delays in the existing surveillance systems and cut down costs. In another research, Sun et al.20 integrated information from outbreak data, genetic sequences and several risk factors in order to gain more accurate information on identifying high-risk areas. Global spatial patterns of highly pathogenic avian influenza were extracted using logistic spatial autoregressive, local k function, phylogenetic tree analysis and Dampster–Shafer evidence21,22 models and concluded that Dampster–Shafer theory was more reliable and robust than other models.Similarly, case data, population statistics and weather conditions were utilized in statistical models to forecast dengue weekly incidence16. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was proven to gain a better performance compared to linear regression and time-series. The LASSO model was used for its high forecast accuracy, but was not able to interpret outbreak predictions. For example, the explanation of why the model forecast a large epidemic in a particular year to stakeholders was not possible.Fusion of information in decision support systems was performed in a different way in a study conducted by Texier and colleagues23. In this study, the decisions of multiple outbreak detection algorithms were combined using several methods including Majority Voting, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Bayesian Network. Finally, Bayesian Network was suggested to be used for decision fusion as it gains at least a performance equal to the best of the individual algorithms. In another study24, a framework was designed to integrate knowledge from different domains for avian influenza outbreak identification. Dempster–Shafer theory was employed to integrate findings of three sets of different methodologies including phylogenetics, spatial statistics and epidemiological analysis. Authors found that integrating all three analyses resulted in a higher level of corroboration than when only one methodology was used.Despite the efforts that have been made to develop decision support systems for controlling infectious diseases, there are still some challenges that remain unaddressed. There is a limited uptake of the decision support systems by policy makers, which probably means the existing decision support systems have not been designed according to the needs of policy makers. Moreover, the presence of multiple forecast systems with different goals makes it difficult for decision makers to choose one. Another challenge is the lack of transparency of decisions in the existing systems, which is a crucial requirement in policy making. The current study aimed to examine solutions to these challenges.MotivationCurrent infectious disease response programs have several limitations that need to be addressed. Time plays a key role in infectious disease management and control. To facilitate management in disease emergencies, making rapid policy decisions is crucial. Early warning systems are defined as timely surveillance systems that collect information on diseases with epidemic possibilities in order to plan intervention policies25. The short amount of time in disease emergency situations neither allows for developing, parametrizing and interpreting new models nor in-depth data reviews by epidemiologists25.In addition, decision makers continuously rely on epidemiological models with many assumptions to understand the future progression of disease outbreaks27. The outcome evidence of these models can be interpreted in multiple ways that may lead to inaccurate understanding of situations.Another problem that could impede response programs is modelling fragmented and incomplete datasets28. A comprehensive data management is necessary for successful data integration and knowledge extraction29. Studies that employ only a single domain knowledge can lead to one-sided knowledge and miss important information24. Moreover, risk assessment studies in epidemiology are usually restricted to health events that have already occurred30. However, retrospective studies alone cannot be used for real-time evaluations.In the present study, we proposed and evaluated a comprehensive and multi-scale framework for avian influenza event prediction. The main goal of the framework was to integrate patterns from digital and spatiotemporal surveillance systems and answer three types of questions: (I) Descriptive questions regarding avian influenza event in the past; (II) Predictive questions regarding the future risk of avian influenza at country-level; and (III) Predictive questions regarding the future risk of avian influenza at provincial-level. We incorporated knowledge concerning disease occurrence history, environmental conditions, migratory bird distribution, poultry density and social media into the framework. Given the three questions that policy makers might ask, a procedure was developed to respond to those questions.As discussed earlier, decision support frameworks should suit the needs of practitioners and policy makers31. In this current proof-of-concept study, a link between decision makers and modellers was build by answering some risk-predicting questions. These questions could be asked by decision makers in order to prepare for and respond to epidemics. The second innovation lies in providing transparent predictions, which means animal health officials can find the reasons behind the predictions made by the system. This is because the rule-based models used in the system are human-interpretable and could greatly facilitate interpretation of decisions. An additional novelty of the system is the continuous and comprehensive data collection, integration and analysis of avian influenza information, which allows rapid and precise results32.The proposed frameworkSystem descriptionThe framework presented here is an extension of previous works and is intended to assist in the early detection of avian influenza events. The framework consists of three parts: data management, knowledge management and user interface. First, several data sources were collected, pre-processed and stored. Then, rules and facts were extracted from the data and stored in a knowledge base. Rules are used as a technique for knowledge representation in a system33 while facts are known information about data. Finally, the knowledge base was used to respond to questions regarding the degree of avian influenza risk at different geographical scales. In the present study, the risk is defined as the likelihood of disease occurring for the first time or continuous events in a region. An overview of the framework is given in Fig. 1. Figure 1 depicts how different elements in each part are related to one another.Figure 1Framework architecture.Full size imageData managementThe data management part was responsible for several operations including data acquisition, pre-processing and integration. Data was collected from Twitter and spatiotemporal data sources. Subsequently, pre-processed techniques such as data cleaning and transformation were applied to raw data to transform it to a useful format for the knowledge management.Spatiotemporal covariates dataWe identified several explanatory variables of avian influenza including temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, pressure34, chicken density, duck density35 and waterfowl density36. These risk factors have been proven to correlate with avian influenza events in previous studies37,38. The corresponding data sources including climatic conditions, geographic extent of migratory bird species, distribution of poultry, and disease historical records were integrated in a spatiotemporal dataset. Integration was performed considering a spatial and temporal resolution of 1-degree × 1-degree and 1-week, respectively. Then, all explanatory variables and response variable were adjusted in the defined resolution.Predictor variables with different spatial and temporal resolutions were adjusted with respect to the defined spatial and temporal resolution. Variables with temporal scale less than a week and spatial scale less than a cell were averaged. Conversely, when the resolution was lower than a cell or a week, we repeated the same values for all the cells or weeks that fit into that resolution.Darksky API was used to return the observed daily weather conditions given a specified date in the past and a location point. The Gridded Livestock of the World offered GeoTIFF format files that were converted to longitude-latitude-value format and then imported to a designed database. Birdlife species data included shapefiles that could be visualized by geographical information system (GIS) software such as ArcGIS. We filtered polygons related to 133 duck species, and in the field called ‘bird_existence’ in the database, we specified whether each cell was inside a bird polygon or not. Other information on these datasets is presented in Table 1.Table 1 Sources of data.Full size tableGlobal Twitter dataTwitter data as a source of disease surveillance can bypass formal information channels and enhance the speed of control actions. To collect global (i.e. country-level) tweets, a crawler was used to visit Twitter on a per minute basis. Several keywords regarding avian influenza were fed into the Twitter Search API and posts were continuously stored in a database. The dataset, in total, contained 209,000 observations, which were collected over 18 months. Subsequently, tweets were filtered and geo-located using their context and re-tweets observations were removed. Subsequently, tweets were geo-located based on their content and irrelevant ones were filtered using a semi-supervised classification. Additionally, duplicate tweets (e.g., re-tweets) were removed from data. The details of data collection and pre-processing of data was previously described40.Figure 2Country-level data collection pipeline.Full size imageCountry-scale Twitter data (Indonesia)A general overview of the provincial-level Twitter data collection pipeline is provided in Fig. 2. Employing the full-archive endpoint of Twitter premium search API, tweets regarding avian influenza for various provinces in the country of Indonesia were requested using a combination of keywords and operators. For example, for Java province in Indonesia, we used the following input: “flu burung Java OR birdflu Java OR H5N1 Java OR H7N9 Java OR bird flu Java OR H5N2 Java”. Tweets were collected for the year 2016, which resulted in a total of approximately 5,000 observations. We selected this period since it was matching to the duration of spatiotemporal covariates data and also due to restrictions on the number of requests in Twitter API.After fetching data from Twitter and storing it in a dataset, tweets were translated into English from the language spoken in that specific country (i.e. Indonesian Language) utilizing Google Cloud Translate API. Given the translated content, we tagged each tweet with a standard list of province names.Ground truth dataTo collect country-level disease events, we utilized a programmed robot to visit OIE web pages41 every four hours. The robot filtered and stored AI-relevant reports including 58 immediate and 382 follow-up notifications for the same duration that global-scale tweets have been collected. Besides, the information on avian influenza events for provincial-level (for Indonesia) was obtained from the Emergency Prevention System for Animal Health (EMPRES-i)39,42.Knowledge managementThe knowledge management part of the system aimed at turning data into insights that facilitate decision making. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the knowledge management component of the system consists of a knowledge base, analysis methods and risk prediction. The knowledge base was designed as a table called ‘knowledge-base’ (see Fig. 3) to store rules and facts derived by applying a set of analyses to the collected data. The knowledge base was then used in answering the questions that end users might ask. SQL queries, noise removal, anomaly detection and rule discovery were analysis methods used in the knowledge management.Figure 3DSS database schema.Full size imageThe historical events of avian influenza were stored as facts with time, location and magnitude elements. Also, several analyses have been performed on Twitter data in order to extract patterns and store them in the knowledge base. For instance, the irrelevant content was filtered out using a semi-supervised classifier. Subsequently, Seasonal-Hybrid Extreme Studentized Deviate (SH-ESD) algorithm was employed to identify spikes from daily time-series of tweets. Then, the patterns containing time, location and magnitude elements were stored in the knowledge base. Moreover, analyses on the spatiotemporal data were performed to derive patterns in the form of ‘if-then’ rules from RuleFit and FP-Growth models. These rules were built using explanatory variables, rank, time and location elements.Descriptive and country-level predictive questions were addressed using the patterns stored in the knowledge base. However, for the predictive questions at the provincial-level, it was necessary to perform additional analysis. The ‘knowledge-base’ table and the spatiotemporal dataset43 were used to calculate the weekly risk of disease events for each province. Algorithm 1 presents the pseudo-code for a step-by-step process of the risk calculation.To calculate the future risk of disease occurrence for a province, a multi-class decision tree classification was applied to risk degrees obtained from the Twitter component, spatiotemporal component and past disease events. Multi-class tasks assume that each example is assigned to one and only one label. Decision tree classifiers are frequently used in classification problems with a good accuracy compared to other machine learning algorithms44. A decision tree is composed of rules extracted from a training set. Feature values at each branching point of the tree are used to split the data. Subsequently, the tree is traversed from the root to leaves with each branching point determining the direction that needs to be followed. Finally, the new instance is assigned with the associated label of the tree leaf that is reached45. Decision tree classifier was implemented here with the help of sklearn python library and a grid search parameter setting.The risk of Twitter and spatiotemporal components was categorized into very low, low, medium, high and very high while the risk of past and future disease events was represented by low, medium and high levels. Table 2 shows the thresholds used to discretize the values. To perform the classification, the risk associated with events occurring in the next 2 weeks was accounted as the ground truth outcome. We calculated the risk by counting the number of events during the defined time (2 weeks) and geographical (province) scales and divided it by the provincial density of poultry.Table 2 Split thresholds.Full size tableUser interfaceThe user interface part of the system can communicate between the knowledge management and user and let users specify their input and receive information. In this section, we explain how different scenarios could be followed by the proposed system in order to respond to various questions asked by end users. Considering the analytics taxonomy of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analyses46, the first type of questions can be placed in the descriptive analysis group as these questions tell us what happened in the past. The second and third type of questions can be in the predictive analysis category as they forecast the future risk of disease. The process of finding answers for sample questions is given in Fig. 4. (I) What countries have reported avian influenza in the past month? Retrospective questions could be answered using historical records of disease. We stored the facts about previous events in the ‘knowledge-base’ table and assigned the ‘Actual’ to the component field. These facts are the result of direct queries on the occurrence data and do not require any additional analyses. As depicted in Fig. 4, if the desired duration of the question is in the past, records in the table with the ‘Actual’ component field are returned. (II) What countries are at risk of new or recurring avian influenza events in the next few weeks/Is the country X at risk of avian influenza within the next few weeks? These questions can be answered by insights that were extracted from the ‘global-scale Twitter’ component of the system. Matching rules are found based on the geographical scale (e.g. country X) and the duration of 2 weeks prior to present date (i.e. the date of question). (III) Which provinces in country X are at risk of new or recurring avian influenza events/Is the province Y in the country X at risk of avian influenza within the next few weeks? To answer these questions, both ‘country-scale Twitter’ and ‘country-scale spatiotemporal covariates’ components could be used. Matching rules from each component return a risk degree that are then combined and used to calculate the final risk. Figure 4Question-answering scenarios.Full size imageValidationThe performance of decision support systems needs to be evaluated by continuous assessment of system operations. Validation of these systems is an opportunity to identify strengths and weaknesses of their functionalities and improve them. Here, the main evaluation was to ensure whether the system is meeting its goal, which is the ability to detect events. Among the questions discussed earlier, the validation of descriptive questions depends on the correctness of the collected gold standard data. Also, the validity of the second type of questions that use Twitter data to detect country-level events was already assessed40. The assessments concluded that 75% of real-world events were identifiable from Twitter data. The validity of the third type of questions is explained in detail as follows.The most important element of the system validation is to identify the ability of the system in predicting the risk of future disease events. As appears in Algorithm 1, line 15, predicted risk for each week was compared to the actual risk of events. A repeated random subsampling approach was used for validation of the prediction model. The data was split into testrain datasets with a proportion of 30% for ten times. Each time, the model was built with train dataset and validated by several measures (Eqs. 1–7) on test dataset. Finally, the model was evaluated by averaging the measures. The popular accuracy measure was not considered as it could be a misleading and unreliable measure for imbalanced datasets. This is because accuracy assigns higher ranks to majority classes47.Taking a class \(C_i\) into consideration, the positive predictive value represents the number of correctly predicted \(C_i\) out of all predicted as \(C_i\). On the other hand, the sensitivity is the number of correctly predicted \(C_i\) out of the number of actual examples with \(C_i\) class. Specificity measures the ability of the system to correctly identify classes other than \(C_i\). Finally, F-score is a weighted average of positive predictive value and sensitivity and G-mean48 is geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity. Also, the micro-average aggregates the contributions of all classes to compute the average metric, whereas macro-average calculates the measures independently for each class and then takes the average. In fact, the micro-average weights all examples equally and therefore, favouring the performance on major classes while the macro-average weights all the classes equally without taking the number of examples in each class into account49. Therefore, in the present study we consider macro-average measures in order to be able to assess the effectiveness of small classes.Calculating measures for class \(C_i\), if the actual class is \(C_i\) and the predicted output is \(C_i\) too, we count it as true positive (TP), and if the predicted output is a class rather than \(C_i\), we count it as false negative (FN). On the other hand, assuming the actual class is a class rather than \(C_i\) and the predicted output is \(C_i\), we call it false positive (FP), otherwise true negative (TN).$$\begin{aligned}&Positive\ Predictive\ Value\ (Precision) = \frac{TP}{(TP + FP)} \end{aligned}$$ (1) $$\begin{aligned}&Sensitivity\ (Recall) = \frac{TP}{(TP + FN)} \end{aligned}$$ (2) $$\begin{aligned}&Specificity = \frac{TN}{(TN + FP)} \end{aligned}$$ (3) $$\begin{aligned}&F_{\mathrm{1}}-score = \frac{2 * Precision * Recall}{Precision + Recall} \end{aligned}$$ (4) $$\begin{aligned}{}&G-mean = \sqrt{Sensitivity * Specificity} \end{aligned}$$ (5) $$\begin{aligned}&Micro-average\ (sensitivity) = \frac{TP_{\mathrm{L}} + TP_{\mathrm{M}} + TP_{\mathrm{H}}}{TP_{\mathrm{L}}+ TP_{\mathrm{M}} + TP_{\mathrm{H}} + FN_{\mathrm{L}}+ FN_{\mathrm{M}} + FN_{\mathrm{H}}} \end{aligned}$$ (6) $$\begin{aligned}&Macro-average\ (measure) = \frac{measure_{\mathrm{L}} + measure_{\mathrm{M}} + measure_{\mathrm{H}}}{3} \end{aligned}$$ (7) Results and discussionSystem responses examplesFor the first type of questions, an example of input fields and the generated output is given in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The facts that have been stored in the knowledge base were the result of direct queries on the datasets related to the historical record of diseases. The output of the following question is generated by finding the rows matching the given input fields. As shown in Table 3, we requested global scale events that had happened in the three past months prior to the time of question. The field ‘component’ is set to ‘actual’, which shows that the ‘actual’ component of the system was involved in answering the question. In response to the question, Table 4 was generated. The output provided information on the name of countries, the year and week when outbreaks occurred. Here, the number of outbreaks that have occurred within the defined period is indicated by field ‘value’.Question (i): What countries have reported avian influenza in the last three months?Table 3 Question (i): input fields.Full size tableTable 4 Question (i): output.Full size tableThe second type of questions, i.e. question (ii), used the global Twitter component (see Table 5). The insights stored in the knowledge base to answer these questions have been obtained from anomaly detection analysis of global Twitter data since last 2 weeks. The generated output in Table 6 summarizes countries that have shown anomalies in their associated Twitter posts along with the time when anomalies have been seen and the number of posts (‘unit’ and ‘value’ fields).Question (ii): What countries are at risk of new or recurring avian influenza events in the next 2 weeks?Table 5 Question (ii): input fields.Full size tableTable 6 Question (ii): output.Full size tableThe third type of questions, i.e. question (iii), finds the degree of risk for the provinces in a specified country.

The figure shows the user Indonesia map with green, orange and red colors representing low, medium and high provincial risks, respectively.Figure 5Provincial risk map (Indonesia)26. The figure shows the user Indonesia map with green, orange and red colors representing low, medium and high provincial risks, respectively.Full size imageSystem assessmentTo evaluate the provincial risk of disease presence, positive predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, G-mean measures (Eqs. 1–5) and their modified versions were calculated for low, medium and high categories. In the modified version of measures, the distance between predictions was taken into consideration. For example, the error associated with the prediction of low risk as the medium was calculated as half of the error associated with predicting the risk as high.The original dataset included 1250 rows with 972 low, 212 medium and 66 high outcome labels. The data was undersampled by discarding observations related to provinces with zero or few events. This resulted in a total of 700 observations with low, medium and high labels of 449, 185 and 66, respectively.Figure 6Multi-class prediction heatmap (test dataset).Full size imageA confusion matrix resulted from validation of the multi-class classification with decision tree model on testing data is reported in Fig. 6. From the confusion matrix, about 23 examples with low risk were predicted as medium or high classes, which shows false negatives for the low class. Also, 11 examples were predicted as low, while they actually belong to other classes. This represents false positives for the low class. The same approach was used to calculate false positives and false negatives for medium and high classes. The values of correctly predicted examples for each class (i.e., true positives) were placed on the diagonal line from up-left to bottom-right for the low, medium and high classes, respectively. The darker the colors get, the higher the values are.Given the information provided by the confusion matrix, we calculated other measures and they are reported in Table 9. Notably, the meaning of positive and negative classes, which are usually used in epidemiologic studies can be switched depending on which class we select as positive. It is desirable to gain high prediction accuracy for minority class and reasonable accuracy for the majority class in risk-assessment systems50. In other words, although effective risk prediction methods emphasize on having less false negatives, false alarms should not be underestimated.In general, sensitivity and specificity measures evaluate the ability of a model to predict true positives and true negatives of each class. Taking the high class as positive (minority class), a sensitivity (positive accuracy) of 78.94% and a specificity (negative accuracy) of 84.54% were achieved. This means that the model had a high ability both in predicting high-risk and non-high-risk events, but it is slightly better in predicting non-high-risk events.Additionally, G-mean was calculated to be 81.69% for the high class, which shows the high performance of classifier simultaneously in positive and negative classes. Unlike G-mean, F-score is dependent on class distribution and is only concerned with the minority class51,52.Table 9 Validation measures for each class.Full size tableTwo types of average measures, i.e. micro-average and macro-average (Eqs. 6–7), have been commonly used as an extension of evaluation measures for multi-class classification53. The original and modified versions of micro-average and macro-average measures for sensitivity and specificity are reported in Table 10.In the Table 10, the micro-average sensitivity shows a higher value than macro-average sensitivity. This is because micro-average measure favoured the majority class54,55 that had a higher sensitivity. Since the data is imbalanced here, the macro-average measures might be more reliable as all classes get equal weights54.Table 10 Average measures of risk prediction.Full size tableConclusions and future workHere, we described a decision support system that was designed, implemented and evaluated for monitoring and prediction of the risk of avian influenza events. The main goal of the present paper was to answer pre-defined questions asked by decision makers regarding the risk of disease at different geographical scales.We reported evaluation measures of the prediction system overall and for each category of low, medium and high risks. Results showed relatively high macro-average measures, suggesting that the system is robust enough to be used as a decision support system in predicting avian influenza events. The evaluation measures of the high-risk class indicated that the system had lower false negative than false-positive errors while identifying high-risk events, which is preferable in risk-assessing systems.As the framework presented here is based on questions directly asked by decision-makers, it could be a stepping stone for creating more connections between animal health officials and modellers. Unlike black-box decision support systems, the system presented here used a collection of rules as a high-level description of data, which is similar to the way humans would describe the data.The proposed framework here employed cross-disciplinary concepts toward monitoring and prediction of avian influenza at country and global scales. The architecture allowed for a comprehensive, timely and systematic data collection, integration and analysis. Since the insights from various data analysis are continuously stored and analyzed, the time required for risk assessment is reduced, which can consequently lead to rapid decision making. To deal with uncertainty, in addition to utilizing heterogeneous data sources, the final decision tree model in the present paper calculates the probability of predictions. Moreover, a fuzzy logic rule-based framework can be designed in the future to consider the uncertainty of information using membership functions.Importantly, the proposed framework may not predict outbreaks caused by low pathogenic viruses as accurately as the ones originated by the high pathogenic viruses. This is due to the fact that the ground truth data (OIE and EMPRES-i) only considers highly pathogenic avian influenza and low pathogenicity H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses that are notifiable.Considering the analytic spectrum, we implemented descriptive and predictive analytics. However, the system can be enhanced by adding prescriptive analytics in the future. As an example, this will allow the system to evaluate several control policies in a high-risk area and suggest the most optimized ones to end users. Also, the applicability of the proposed framework might be enhanced by extending the database to include new data sources. Additional work might include ongoing collaboration and interactions between modellers and policy makers to constantly monitor the performance of warning systems.

Plague caused by Yersinia pestis endangers large populations during outbreaks or bioterrorism attacks. Recommended antibiotic countermeasures include well-established protocols based on animal studies and corroborated by effective treatment of human cases. Until now, prior exposure to viral respiratory infections was not taken into consideration when selecting the appropriate treatment for plague. Here, we show that as late as 25 days after exposure to influenza virus, convalescent mice still exhibited an increased susceptibility to sublethal doses of Y. pestis, presented with aberrant cytokine expression, and impaired neutrophil infiltration in the lungs. Increased levels of M2 alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cells, as well as induction in metalloproteases expression and collagen and laminin degradation, suggested that the previous viral infection was under resolution, correlating with enhanced susceptibility to plague. Surprisingly, postexposure prophylaxis treatment with the recommended drugs revealed that ciprofloxacin was superior to doxycycline in mice recovering from influenza infection. These results suggest that after an influenza infection, the consequences, such as impaired immunity and lung tissue remodeling and damage, should be considered when treating subsequent Y. pestis exposure.

The disease has not yet been eradicated, and possible epidemics still constitute an important public health concern, mainly in developing countries. Recently, the island of Madagascar has experienced a severe outbreak of pneumonic plague, making it one of the world’s worst plague epidemics in the last few decades1,2. The pneumonic form of plague develops following inhalation of bacteria-containing droplets or aerosols. After an initial flu-like phase, patients develop acute pneumonia and a fulminant disease with the capability of person-to-person transmission3,4,5. High mortality rates in untreated patients as well as the contagious nature of this disease led to the recognition of Y. pestis as one of the most dangerous biothreat agents6. Several antibiotics are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for prophylaxis and treatment of plague, including both bacteriostatic (e.g. doxycycline) and bactericidal drugs (e.g. ciprofloxacin) 7.Influenza viruses are a prevalent cause of seasonal illness associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections and have been reported as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, mainly among pregnant women, very young children, the elderly, patients with comorbidities and immunosuppressed individuals8,9,10. It has long been known that influenza increases the susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections caused by S. pneumonia, S. aureus, H. influenza and others9,11,12. Recently, an association between severe influenza of immunocompetent patients and invasive Aspergillus infection of the lungs has also been reported, emphasizing the risk of secondary opportunistic infections with influenza13 Reports indicate that bacterial coinfections are found in 4–30% of adults and in 22–33% of children who are hospitalized with community-acquired viral pneumonia14, and up to 75% of those infected with influenza and develop pneumonia are confirmed to have a bacterial coinfection11. Bacterial secondary pneumonia as a complication of viral flu caused by influenza or other respiratory viral pathogens, was reported to occur at very high frequency during seasonal influenza as well as the pandemic of 1918 and multiple subsequent epidemics, for review see15,16. Furthermore, a very recent retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients from the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Wuhan, China, indicated that 50 percent of the fatalities may have developed lethal secondary bacterial infections17.Studies using mouse infection models that appear to mimic the clinical course of secondary bacterial infection following influenza indicate that susceptibility to the bacterial infection peaks early after influenza infection18,19,20. The molecular interactions by which influenza viruses are associate with secondary infections involve lung tissue damage and were suggested to be associated with superior access to nutrients and exposure of receptors that enable improved adherence, survival and dissemination to the lower-respiratory tract where resident or invading bacteria are localized21,22. Host antiviral responses that might also facilitate secondary bacterial infection also include dysfunction of the early antibacterial innate immune response, leading to suppression of phagocytic and cytotoxic activities by macrophages and neutrophils23,24.Accordingly, in the current study, we reasoned that pre-exposure to seasonal viral respiratory infections may not only increase susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens but also to pneumonia-causing virulent pathogens during a natural outbreak or deliberate events. Furthermore, the present study explores the possibility that suppression of innate immune responses by pulmonary viral infection might continue for long periods of time and reduce the efficacy of antibacterial therapy. Thus, using well-established mouse models, we directly evaluated the influence of influenza on the susceptibility to develop a subsequent plague infection after exposure during a late-stage postinfluenza infection (25 days). The data support the notion that the absence of an adequate inflammatory response concomitant with substandard neutrophil infiltration and bacterial clearance in the lungs was associated with a resolution and tissue remodeling processes; this phenomenon was depicted by an elevation in the number of alveolar macrophages (AMs) harboring the M2 phenotype, the induction of matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and the elevation in type 2 epithelial cells near the damaged alveolus. This ongoing process and the consequent inferior immune response have an important impact on treatment with the CDC-recommended antibiotic doxycycline (Doxy), but not ciprofloxacin (Cipro), against pulmonary Y. pestis infection during late-stage postinfluenza.ResultsEnhanced susceptibility to Y. pestis infection postinfluenza is associated with a decreased inflammatory response in the lungIn this study, the well-established murine model of influenza infection based on the mouse-adapted human virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) influenza virus—PR/8 was employed19,25. As depicted in Fig. 1A, mice infected with a sublethal dose of influenza virus exhibited a severe reduction in body weight (~ 25%) 8–10 days postinfluenza infection (dpii), yet all mice survived the infection. The weight loss was followed by a gradual return to the normal weight 13–14 dpii with a stable and moderate elevation in the body weight thereafter, as compare to naïve mice that presented continuous increase in their body weight. To address the question of whether influenza infection results in enhanced susceptibility to pulmonary infection with the Y. pestis strain Kim53, mice were infected by i.n. exposure with 0.2 LD50 Y. pestis at various time points follow influenza infection. Y. pestis infection with this low dose was resulted with survival of 80% of naïve mice, which were not preinfected with influenza virus (Fig. 1B-II). As expected, mice showed high susceptibility to a sublethal challenge of Y. pestis during the early (7 dpii), mid (10 dpii) and late stages of the disease up to 14 dpii a time point where their initial body weight was regained (Fig. 1B-I). Surprisingly, augmented susceptibility was observed even at 25 dpii, when the virus was effectively cleared from mouse lungs (Figure S1). Forty days postinfluenza infection, mice susceptibility to Y. pestis exposure returned to the level observed in naïve mice (Fig. 1B-III). The unexpected susceptibility observed 25 days postinfluenza recovery was the subject of this study, and accordingly, all experiments documented in the present report focus on this time point. We first evaluated cytokine expression in the lungs due to their role in host defense as leukocyte chemoattractants and as activating factors involved in modulation of the innate response to invading pathogens26. As depicted in Fig. 1C, naïve mice that were challenged with a sublethal dose of Kim53, exhibited gradual induction in the level of various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines after bacterial infection. In contrast, mice challenged at 25 dpii had an initial higher cytokines and chemokines levels as compare to naïve mice, however these levels were not increased after Y. pestis infection, correlating with their high susceptibility. These observations were supported by appropriate ANOVA (Figure S2). The overall findings motivated inspection of immune cell recruitment to the lung and the consequent bacterial clearance.Figure 1Mouse survival and cytokine expression in the lungs of influenza convalescent mice after airway exposure to Kim53.

(C) Cytokine and chemokine levels in the lungs at the indicated time points after i.n. infection of naïve mice with 0.2 LD50 of Kim53 (black) compared to mice infected with a similar dose of Kim53 administered at 25 dpii (blue) (n = 7–8 mice per time point,). #p < 0.05, ###p < 0.001 vs. Kim53 at t = 0. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 vs Kim53 at the same time point.Full size imageLimited neutrophil infiltration and Y. pestis clearance in the lung postinfluenza infectionNeutrophil recruitment to the site of infection is a fundamental step towards bacterial clearance from infected organs. We have previously shown that the early recruitment of neutrophils to the lung has a beneficial effect on bacterial clearance and mouse survival following Y. pestis strain Kim53 infection27. Hence, we examined the level of neutrophils in the lungs of both naïve mice and mice infected with influenza 25 days earlier. We detected an induced recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs of naïve mice as early as 24 h after infection with Kim53, while examination of Kim53-infected mice at 25 dpii revealed no elevation in neutrophil level in the lungs (Fig. 2A,B). The lack of infiltrating neutrophils was correlated with a higher bacterial load in the lungs and subsequent dissemination to the spleen (Fig. 2C). To confirm that susceptibility to a sublethal dose of Y. pestis postinfluenza infection resulted from an aberrant immune response in the lungs, mice were infected with the avirulent Y. pestis strain Kim53∆70∆10 in which the pPCP1 and pCD1 virulence plasmids were cured (mut-Kim53)27. While naïve mice were able, as expected, to clear bacteria rapidly from the lungs preventing bacterial dissemination to the blood and spleen, mice previously infected with influenza virus exhibited delayed clearance of the mutated-Kim53 strain from the lungs and spleen (Fig. 2E). As observed with the wild-type Y. pestis strain Kim53, clearance of the mutated bacteria from the lungs of naïve mice was associated with neutrophil infiltration to the lung 24 h postinfection, while in influenza-infected mice, the response was delayed and detected only 72 h postinfection (Fig. 2D). Analysis of this data was supported by appropriate ANOVA (Figure S2). Taken together, the data strongly support the notion that the enhanced susceptibility to pulmonary Y. pestis exposure, 25 days after influenza infection, involves an attenuation of the innate host immune response in the lungs. It is interesting to note that unlike the innate immune response, the adaptive humoral immune response was not affected, as demonstrated by the observation that the challenge with the mut-Kim53 strain resulted in elicitation of IgG titers targeting Y. pestis capsular protein—F1, similar in the sera of naïve mice and influenza-infected mice (Figure S3).Figure 2Delayed neutrophil infiltration to the lung and impaired bacterial clearance in mice infected with Y. pestis strains 25 dpii.

Therefore, we employed the previously documented exogenous chemoattractant treatment to promote the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the lungs of Kim53-infected mice postinfluenza infection. Accordingly, following influenza infection, mice were treated with a daily subcutaneous injection of G-CSF for 5 consecutive days, starting 3 days prior to a challenge with a sublethal dose of Kim53. Six hours after bacterial infection, recombinant KC and MIP-2 proteins were administered i.n. (Fig. 3A). Indeed, the treatment substantially increased neutrophil levels in the lungs of mice challenged with Kim53 25 dpii (Fig. 3B). This was accompanied by a reduction in bacterial counts in the lungs and their absence in the spleens (Fig. 3C). However, unexpectedly, no improvement was observed in the survival rate of treated mice (Fig. 3D). Taken together, the data indicate that the susceptibility of mice promoted by influenza infection cannot be solely attributed to the observed inadequate neutrophil recruitment and possibly involves other lung resident cells whose activities may have been affected and failed to be restored to their normal level even 4 weeks postinfluenza infection.Figure 3Early recruitment of neutrophils to the lung improves bacterial clearance but not survival rates.

Evaluation of the percentage and absolute number of AMs revealed an increase in the lung 25 dpii (Fig. 4A). Macrophages can be divided into two functional groups: M1 macrophages that possess proinflammatory properties and mediate host defense against invading pathogens and M2 macrophages that possess antiinflammatory activity and regulate tissue healing30,31,32,33. We further quantified these two cell populations by cell sorting analysis based on specific immune staining of their surface markers: macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) which is highly expressed on M1-macrophages, and CD200 receptor (CD200R) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM2) which characterize M2-macrophages as previously documented in various models of pulmonary infections29,34,35,36. Expression levels of these surface proteins on CD11c + /SiglecF + AMs as detected by flow cytometer analysis revealed a reduction in MARCO expression and increased cell surface levels of CD200R and TREM2 in mice infected 25 days earlier with influenza virus as compare to naive (Fig. 4B,C). This pattern of surface marker staining indicates that the analyzed AMs belong to the M2 class.Figure 4A continuing lung resolution process at 25 dpii characterized by AMs and type II epithelial cell phenotype in the lung. Mice were infected i.n. with a dose of 20 pfu of the influenza virus PR8 (data labeled as blue) or administered with PBS (data labeled as black) and analyzed after 25 days.

Scale bar, 50 µm. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 vs naïve.Full size imageDuring lung injury, damaged alveolar type (AT) I cells that cover 95–98% of the alveolar surface lead to increased permeability of the lung, while the cuboidal alveolar type (AT) II cells re-epithelialize the alveolar surface via proliferation and transdifferentiation into alveolar type I (ATI) cells as part of the lung repair mechanism37,38. We therefore analyzed ATI and alveolar type II (ATII) cell distribution in the lungs at 25 dpii by immune staining of the ATI cell marker T1α and the prosurfactant protein C (proSPC), a marker for ATII cells37. Indeed, damaged ATI cells were observed in the lungs as indicated by faint and truncated staining of T1α lining the alveolar septa (Fig. 4D,F). Conversely, the levels of ATII cells were elevated, as indicated by robust proSPC expression 25 dpii (Fig. 4E,G,H). Data analysis was supported by appropriate ANOVA (Figure S2). In conclusion, the increased population of M2 AMs and the high proportion of ATII cells at this late-stage postinfluenza infection strongly suggest that an ongoing tissue repair process is still active in the lungs of the recovered mice and may be responsible for the observed increased susceptibility to a secondary bacterial infection.ECM remodeling and MMP expression in the lungs are induced 25 dpiiTissue repair is a multistep process that includes inflammation, re-epithelialization, and angiogenesis, which are orchestrated by extra cellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. As a prerequisite step during tissue remodeling and repair, ECM proteolysis within the wounded environment involves the expression and activation of various matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) with diverse targets for proteolytic activity, including ECM proteins, adhesion molecules, growth factors, chemokines and cytokines, involving a range of repair processes39,40,41. To further address the tissue repair process in the mice 25 days following influenza infection, we first determined the level of the major ECM component, collagen, in its soluble form in the BALF samples as an indication of ECM proteolysis. As depicted in Fig. 5A, collagen degradation was considerably elevated in the influenza convalescent mice. To substantiate these results, expression levels of various MMPs that play a major role during lung injury were analyzed in the lungs and included MMP7, MMP12, MMP2 and MT1-MMP42. The data depicted in Fig. 5B indicate that the MMP expression levels were higher in 25 dpii mice than in naïve mice. MT1-MMP was shown to be essential in the ECM remodeling process during influenza or tuberculosis infections20,43. In line with this notion, we observed increased MT1-MMP expression in immune cells and AMs in particular during the late stages of postinfluenza infection (Fig. 5C). Accordingly, we questioned whether MT1-MMP blocking would have any therapeutic value in our model. Hence, we applied a therapeutic regime demonstrated to be effective in downregulating MT1-MMP-mediated proteolysis, consisting of treating the mice for five consecutive days starting 24 h after influenza infection, with the selective allosteric and high specific inhibitory antibody (anti-LEM2/15) targeting MT1-MMP proteolytic activity (Fig. 5D). Targeting MT1-MMP activity resulted in a decreased level of tissue proteolysis as well as decreased levels of collagen (Fig. 5E,F) and laminin (Fig. 5G,H) degradation. In support of these observations, after a challenge with a sublethal dose of Y. pestis, compared to their untreated counterparts, treated mice with anti MT1-MMP Ab exhibited improved survival (Fig. 5I). These results strongly support the notion that the active resolution process in the lungs of mice is responsible for the susceptibility of the mice to subsequent plague infection. These observations were supported by appropriate ANOVA (Figure S2).Figure 5Increased ECM remodeling and MMP expression in the lungs 25 dpii.

Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is a bactericide that affects bacteria by interfering with DNA replication46. Doxycycline, on the other hand, is a bacteriostatic antibiotic that belongs to the tetracycline family, attenuating bacterial growth by targeting the ribosomal subunit 30S, leading to impeded bacterial protein synthesis46. Both drugs are effective against Y. pestis infection, yet their efficacy has not been evaluated on the background of pulmonary influenza infection. To test their protective potential against Y. pestis infection postinfluenza, mice were i.n. infected with a high lethal dose of 100 LD50 of the Y. pestis strain Kim53 25 dpii. Antibiotic treatment was initiated 24 h after Y. pestis infection for 5 consecutive days as described (see Fig. 6A—experimental scheme). In this pneumonic mouse model, nontreated animals succumbed to the infection within 3–4 days (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, while both antibiotics exhibited high protection levels in Kim53 infected mice, doxycycline treatment of Y. pestis infected mice postinfluenza infection, exhibited inferior protection capability (20% survival) compared to the full protection achieved by ciprofloxacin treatment (100% survival) (Fig. 6D-I and C-I, respectively). Analysis of bacterial propagation revealed the efficacy of ciprofloxacin in bacterial clearance from the lungs (Fig. 6C-II). On the other hand, doxycycine, which was effective in naïve mice (as reflected by the gradual reduction in bacterial counts), failed to improve bacterial clearance from the lung postinfluenza, and an increase in bacterial counts was observed after the last treatment (Fig. 6D-II). In line with these observations, neutrophils in the lungs of ciprofloxacin-treated mice were slightly higher between naïve and postinfluenza-infected Y. pestis mice (Fig. 6C-III). In contrast, doxycycline treatment of naïve mice infected with a lethal dose of Kim53 was followed by neutrophil recruitment to the lungs and their subsequent gradual reduction in correlation to bacterial count. However, neutrophils recruitment that was observed after doxycycline treatment postinfluenza infection was again not efficient in bacterial clearance (Fig. 6D-III), emphasizing the recovery phase of the lungs and the lack of assistance from other immune resident cells.Figure 6Antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin compared to doxycycline against pulmonary Y. pestis infection, 25 days postinfluenza infection. (A) Experimental scheme for antibiotic treatment: naïve mice were i.n. infected with a lethal dose of 100 LD50 Kim53 or with a similar dose of Kim53 administered 25 dpii. Antibiotic treatment was started 24 h after Y. pestis exposure for 5 consecutive days with Cipro (40 mg/kg q 24 h) or with Doxy (50 mg/kg q 12 h).

Respiratory tract viral infection has been recognized in recent times as an important predisposition factor for subsequent bacterial pneumonia, which represents a challenging clinical complication12,23. Occurrence of natural or bioterrorism-related plague after influenza should not be regarded as a hypothetical situation, as regular seasonal influenza attack rates were shown to be 15.2–22.5% among children and 3.5–10.7% among adults in data reported for unvaccinated controls in controlled vaccine studies during regular seasons47,48. Attack rate during influenza pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza A are significantly higher, with almost 50% of children infected49. Therefore, any outbreak of plague during or after the influenza season would necessarily include individuals recovering from influenza. In this study, for the first time, we investigated a phenomenon of lethal synergism observed in influenza-infected convalescent mice subsequently exposed to Y. pestis strain Kim53 pulmonary infection. The study was prompted by the observation that mice exhibited high susceptibility to pulmonary infection with a sublethal dose of Y. pestis strain Kim53 almost a month after an influenza infection and, most importantly, almost 2 weeks following an apparent full recovery from disease as observed by return to their initial body weight (Fig. 1A). While various bacterial superinfection on the background of viral influenza is a matter of intense research, most of the studies focused on the early stages of the disease, e.g., 3–7 days postinfluenza viral infection19,20,50. Disease manifestation post influenza infection in mice, reaches its peak 7–10 days postinfection as reflected by loss of body mass (Fig. 1A). At this culminant phase of the disease, expectedly, impaired immune responses and severe tissue damage may have explained hyper-susceptibility to a secondary bacterial infection. Here, we documented that, even 25 dpii, the mice remained susceptible to pulmonary infection with a sublethal dose of Kim53. It is important to note that at this stage, mice regained and even exceed their initial body weight and did not express any clinical symptom such as hunched posture, eyes closed, soiled hair coat, nor viral traces could be detected in their lungs; therefore, they appeared to have fully recovered. The study provides evidence that at this late-stage postinfection: (i) the innate immune response in the lungs of mice is still affected; (ii) the lungs are undergoing an alveolar healing process, which correlates with the increased susceptibility to secondary Kim53 infection; and (iii) antibiotic treatment with the bacteriostatic drug doxycycline was found to be considerably less effective for the treatment of plague infection in influenza convalescent mice compared to in naïve animals, a phenomenon that was not observed with the bactericidal drug ciprofloxacin.The lung innate immune response elicited in influenza convalescent mice by a secondary Y. pestis infection was not optimal 25 days following the primary infectionThis conclusion was initially suggested by the profile of inflammatory cytokine expression in the lungs after Y. pestis strain Kim53 infection (Fig. 1C). Cytokines constitute the largest and most pleiotropic group of mediators that initiate pulmonary innate responses including mononuclear cell recruitment to inflamed organs. While their immediate increase in the lungs of naïve mice was early observed after infection with a sublethal dose of Y. pestis, an absence in elevation were observed in subjects with a previous influenza infection. Notably, relatively higher levels of chemokines and cytokines which are remnants of the inflammatory storm related to viral infection, were detected in convalescent mice at 25 dpii. Immediately after infection, neutrophils are required for reduction in the bacterial load. It is well established that neutrophils have a pivotal role in the response to pulmonary Y. pestis infection27,51,52,53. At different stages during pneumonic plague, variable manifestations of neutrophil activity were described. It was shown that neutrophil recruitment to the lung is inhibited during the first 24–36 h after pulmonary infection with a lethal dose (100 LD50) of Y. pestis27,54,55. In this study, pulmonary infection of naïve mice with a sublethal dose of Y. pestis strain Kim53 (0.2 LD50) was followed by a moderate and transient increased levels of infiltrating neutrophils in the lung, correlating with improved bacterial clearance. Neutrophil data was collected as a proportion; yet, overall neutrophil levels increase was similar to our previous studies and we observed an overall increase in WBC. However, after infection with the sublethal dose of Y. pestis carried out 25 days postinfluenza, an increased bacterial propagation in the lung and the spleen was detected, in line with a lower neutrophil recruitment to the lung. A previous study documented a sustained desensitization to bacterial Toll-like receptor ligands after resolution of respiratory influenza infection, an effect that lasted for several months and could be associated with reduced chemokine production and a subsequent limited neutrophil recruitment to the lung56. Given the possibility that the lack of neutrophil infiltration to the lungs may be the result of such an inferior Toll-like receptor sensitivity, we implemented an artificial method for rapid induction of neutrophil recruitment to the lung based on combined G-CSF, KC and MIP-2 treatment27. Indeed, the treatment resulted in an increase in neutrophil levels in the lung as well as reduced bacterial loads (Fig. 3), yet no improvement in the mouse survival rate was observed. Therefore, we concluded that the observed increased susceptibility of the mice to Y. pestis strain Kim53 infection so long after influenza infection cannot be solely attributed to suboptimal neutrophil recruitment. Furthermore, inspection of secondary Y. pestis infection with a nonvirulent mutant strain (Fig. 2D,E) indicated that the observed increased susceptibility of convalescent mice did not involve an enhancement of the intrinsic virulence of the bacteria but rather an inferior innate immune response in the lungs.Lungs of influenza convalescent mice undergo an extended phase of alveolar restoration, which correlates with increased susceptibility to secondary Y. pestis infectionThe first line of defense in the lung relies on an immediate sentinel response promoted by perpetual self-renewing resident AMs57. In line with their key role, depletion of AMs 3–7 dpii and their subsequent renewal 7 days later were reported58. Interestingly, a substantial increase in the population of AMs was observed in the current study 25 dpii (Fig. 4A). Previous studies indicated a reduction in proinflammatory M1 macrophages and a parallel increase in antiinflammatory M2 macrophages during resolution of airway inflammation postinfluenza29. In line with the role of M2 macrophages in lung tissue healing, in the current study, we detected the phenotypic CD200R/ TREM2/ MARCO signature of M2 macrophages34,35,36 in the lungs of the convalescent mice (Fig. 4B–C). These data strongly suggest that a prolonged repair mechanism is active 25 days postinfection, much later than anticipated.Influenza-associated lung injury damages the epithelial endothelial barrier in the alveolus, and this damage is repaired in the course of a healing process of lung resolution dictated by ATII cells expressing surfactant protein C. These self-renewing cells represent precursors of differentiated ATI cells that comprise the majority of the alveolus in the healed lung59. The observed reduction in ATI cells, the loss of the epithelium in the bronchioles and the expansion of ATII cells during late-stage postinfluenza infection (Fig. 4D–G) support the notion that a resolution process is in progress in the mouse lungs. Another hallmark of tissue restoration in general and of the lung in particular is the remodeling of collagen and other ECM components by MMPs, which are essential for the repair process30,42. MMP proteolytic activities in the lung following damage have intricate and often contradictory roles associated both with deleterious and remodeling effects in the tissue, as well as with modulation of the innate immune response. Their beneficial role in tissue regeneration requires a delicate balance between their levels of expression at various stages of the infection. Interestingly, blocking proteolytic activity in vivo was suggested to have a therapeutic effect in other primary and secondary models of bacterial infections20.During late-stage postinfluenza infection, we determined increased collagen degradation in the BALF samples, accompanied by an MMP expression profile that included upregulation of MMP7, MMP12, MMP2 and MT1-MMP (Fig. 5A–C) pointing on tissue remodeling. The importance of MMP7 during lung re-epithelialization was shown in Mmp7−/− mice subjected to lung injury60,61. Similarly, the induction of MMP12 expression in the lungs postinfluenza is in line with its profibrotic protease activity as demonstrated in other lung injury models62,63. MT1-MMP is a major collagenase of the lung whose activity is essential for maintaining tissue integrity and is necessary for immune cell recruitment and cytokine expression42. Accordingly, in the process of lung healing, its activity is increased, resulting in the depletion of its substrates collagen and laminin (Fig. 5E–H). Furthermore, we show that interfering with MT1-MMP in the course of influenza infection (by antibody-mediated reversal of its activity) improved the survival rate of convalescent mice subjected to secondary pulmonary sublethal Y. pestis infection to levels commensurate with those observed in naïve mice (Fig. 5I). These findings are in line with the study that elegantly demonstrated that controling MT1-MMP dysregulated activity during a specific therapeutic window, appears to improve therapeutic effect20. The data strongly support the conclusion that the increased susceptibility to plague is associated with physiological lung resolution processes, which are active late in the course of postinfluenza healing. Of note, alveolar cytolysis and acute lung injury are associated with human and rhesus macaques infections by MERS-CoV and SARS64, strongly suggesting that a lung healing process, as described in the present report, may represent a frequent cause for secondary bacterial infection following exposure to a wide variety of respiratory viruses including coronavirus.Low efficacy of antibiotic treatment with doxycycline for treatment of secondary plague infectionThe vulnerability of the murine lungs postinfluenza infection and the observed increase in the susceptibility of the mice to plague prompted us to directly address the possible consequence of this phenomenon on the efficacy of postexposure therapeutic approaches.Plague can be treated successfully with various antibiotics, including streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline and ciprofloxacin, which exploit distinct antimicrobial effects44,45. Both doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are recommended as the preferred choice for post-exposure prophylaxis by the CDC3. In this study, we found a major difference between the ability of doxycycline and ciprofloxacin to protect mice exposed to pneumonic plague nearly a month after an influenza infection (Fig. 6). The bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin was efficient in bacterial elimination and led to complete protection against a lethal infection dose of Y. pestis strain Kim53 in both naïve and influenza convalescent mice. In contrast, doxycycline treatment resulted in poor survival of similarly infected mice 25 dpii. We speculate that the bacteriostatic nature of this antibiotic heavily depends on the activity of phagocytic cells to manifest its therapeutic potential. Thus, in the context of doxycycline treatment, an optimal operating immune response may be required for full eradication of the metabolically inert, yet live, bacteria, which may not be the case with ciprofloxacin treatment, which directly results in bacterial killing. We cannot rule out additional possible explanations including differential pharmacokinetic properties of the antibiotics, differential immunomodulatory effects or that the healing process taking place in the lungs may have generated an environment that restricts the interaction between the drug and the bacteria. The exact mechanism for the observed limited efficacy of doxycycline after influenza requires additional analysis, and this issue is currently being further studied in our laboratory. Interestingly, such a prolonged period of hyper-susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections was recently documented in COVID-19 hospitalized non-survivor patients, which exhibited secondary infection 17 days after illness onset. While 98% of the patients received antibiotic treatment known to represent an efficient anti-bacterial countermeasure, only 50% survived17. In another retrospective study of 85 fatal cases of COVID-19 from Wuhan, combination of anti-microbial drugs did not offer considerable benefit to patients belonging to high risk groups of individuals of advanced age and/or suffering of co-morbidities65 These reports, as well as the observations documented in the present report, substantiate the possible effect of viral infection on the efficiency of antibiotic treatment of subsequent bacterial secondary infections, and strongly suggest that such scenarios may require adjustments of the recommended treatments.Regardless of the mechanisms underlying the phenomena described here, the results underline the importance of the choice of antibiotics against various bacterial infections secondary to seasonal viral influenza as well as other pulmonary viral infections, and shed light on the importance of lungs ECM protection to provide a better outcome of antibiotic treatment. Although plague is a rare bacterial infection, it is clinically relevant in both natural and bioterrorism scenarios, and seasonal influenza infections should be taken into consideration when selecting the appropriate therapeutic response.Materials and methodsY. pestis strains and culture conditionsThe fully virulent Y. pestis Kimberley53 (Kim53) strain and the avirulent Kimberley53∆70∆10 strain (spontaneously pPCP1- and pCD1-cured Kim53 strain—mut Y. pestis) were grown on brain heart infusion agar (BHIA, BD) for 48 h at 28 °C. For intranasal (i.n.) infection, bacterial colonies were harvested and diluted in heart infusion broth (HIB, BD) supplemented with 0.2% (+) xylose and 2.5 mM CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich) to an OD660 of 0.01 and grown for 22 h at 28 °C in a shaker (100 rpm) as previously described66. At the end of the incubation period, the cultures were washed, diluted in a saline solution to the required infection dose and quantified by counting colony forming units after plating and incubating on BHIA plates (48 h at 28 °C).Ethics statementAll animal experiments were performed in accordance with Israeli law and were approved by the Ethics Committee for animal experiments at the Israel Institute for Biological Research (permit numbers: IACUC-IIBR M-65-2016, and IACUC-IIBR M-90-2016). During the experiments, mice were monitored daily. Humane endpoints were used in our survival studies. Mice exhibiting loss of the righting reflex were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Analgesics were not used as they may have affected the experimental outcomes of the studies.Infection of mice with influenzaStrain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) influenza virus (PR/8) was a kind gift from Dr. Michal Mandelboim (Central Virology Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel). The virus was propagated in embryonated chicken eggs as previously described67. Briefly, the PR/8 virus was propagated by injecting 0.1 ml of stock virus (hemagglutination unit (HAU = 2,048) diluted 1/100 into the allantoic sac of 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. After incubation for 72 h at 37 °C and 30 min at − 20 °C, ~ 8 ml of virus-rich allantoic fluid was removed, HAU was determined with chicken erythrocytes, and virus titers were determined by a plaque assay on Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell monolayers. The virus was then stored at − 80 °C until use. For infection, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of 0.5% ketamine HCl and 0.1% xylazine and then infected intranasal (i.n.) with 20 pfu in a volume of 50 μl/mouse.Infection of mice with Y. pestis Female C57BL/6 (8–10 weeks old) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (USA) and maintained under defined flora conditions at the Israel Institute for Biological Research animal facilities. i.n. infections were performed as described previously27. Briefly, bacterial colonies were harvested and grow as described above. At the end of the incubation period, the cultures were washed, diluted in PBS solution to the required infection dose and quantified by counting colony forming units after plating and incubating on BHIA plates (48 h at 28 °C). Prior to infection, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of 0.5% ketamine HCl and 0.1% xylazine and then i.n. infected with 35 μl/mouse of bacterial suspension, whereas control naïve mice were i.n. instilled with only PBS. The i.n. LD50 of the Kim53 strain under these conditions was 1100 cfu. LD50 values were calculated according to the method described by Reed and Muench68.Monitoring bacterial disseminationTo examine bacterial dissemination in the lungs and the spleen, the mice were euthanized, and the lungs and spleens were then removed and placed on a 70 µm nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon) dipped in 2 ml or 1 ml PBS (accordingly) containing a 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (SIGMA). Cell suspension is prepared by mashing the organ against the cell strainer using a syringe plunger69. Bacterial quantification was carried out by counting colony forming units after plating and incubating on BHIA plates (48 h at 28 °C).Chemokines and cytokine analysisChemokines and cytokines analysis was performed as previously described27. Briefly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected by exposing the trachea and injecting, then removing, a total of 1 ml PBS containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (SIGMA) twice. The BALF samples were then filtered and stored at − 80 °C. Before analysis, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 g for 5 min. The IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα, KC, MIP-2, G-CSF, TGFβ1, IL-10 and IL-4 levels in the BALF were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems).Flow cytometry analysisTo generate a lung cell suspension, mice were euthanized, and blood was withdrawn from the mouse hearts with a heparinized syringe. The lungs were then removed and placed on a 70 µm nylon cell strainer as previously described69. Cell suspensions were pelleted at 260 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and washed twice in FACS buffer. Neutrophils (CD11b+/Gr-1high) were stained with PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b (clone M1/70) (eBioscience) and APC-conjugated anti-mouse Ly6G (Gr-1) (clone RB6-8C5) (eBioscience) antibodies. AMs (SiglecF/CD11c) were stained with PerCP-efluor710-conjugated anti-mouse SiglecF (clone 1RNM44N) (eBioscience), APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD11c (clone N418) (eBioscience), PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD220R (clone OX110) (eBioscience), FITC-conjugated anti-mouse MARCO (cat# FAB2956F) (R&D), and PE-conjugated anti-mouse TREM-2 (cat# FAB17291P) (R&D) antibodies. Cells were stained using standard protocols and appropriate matched isotype control antibodies. The analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest Pro (BD Biosciences).Combined treatment with G-CSF, KC and MIP-2Three days prior to infection with Y. pestis Kim53, mice received a daily subcutaneous injection of recombinant G-CSF (300 µg/kg rhG-CSF/Neupogen 48 MU/0.5 ml, Roche Applied Science) for 5 consecutive days. Six hours post i.n. infection with Y. pestis Kim53, mice were anesthetized, and 1 µg of each recombinant KC and MIP-2 (recombinant MCXCL1/KC and recombinant MCXCL2/MIP-2, R&D Systems), diluted in 25 µl of PBS, or 25 µl of PBS alone (sham) were instilled i.n. Mice were sacrificed and analyzed 24 or 48 hpi or their morbidity and mortality rates were determined.Anti MT1-MMP treatmentLEM 2/15 (anti-MT1-MMP) purification was conducted as previously described20. Antibody was given for five consecutive days, 24 hpii, 3 mg/kg intraperitoneally, 100 µl per injection.RT-PCR and quantitative PCR analysisQuantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed as previously described27. Briefly, total RNA from lung cell suspensions was extracted using TRI Reagent (Cat. T9424, Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two micrograms of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT primers (Promega). Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using an ABI 7500 machine (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The fold change in gene transcript quantity compared with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) was measured using the comparative (− 2∆∆Ct) method. Forty cycles of PCR were performed in duplicate for each primer (Table 1).Table 1 Sequences of primers used in this study.Full size tableCollagen concentration in the BALF—Sircol assayThe Sircol collagen assay (Biocolor, UK) was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions and as was previously described70. Briefly, 1 ml of Sirius red reagent was added to each BALF (50 µl) sample and mixed for 30 min. The collagen-dye complex was precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min, and the pellet was dissolved in the supplied alkaline reagent. Finally, the absorbance of the samples was measured at 540 nm. The collagen concentration of the influenza-infected samples expressed as µg/ml was normalized to that of the littermate naive samples.Immunofluorescence staining—floating sectionsImmunofluorescence staining using floating sections technique was performed as previously described71. Briefly, the mice were euthanized, and the lungs were rapidly removed, postfixed (4 °C) in 4% neutral-buffered paraformaldehyde (pH = 7.0, 4 °C) for 24 h, then immersed in 4% neutral-buffered paraformaldehyde (pH 7.0, 4 °C) containing 30% sucrose until the lungs sunk (approximately 2 weeks) and frozen at − 80 °C until use. Then, 30-μm-thick cryosections were serially cut and transferred to a 12-well culture dish. Three milliliters of PBS were added gently to each well containing a section to allow the sections to thaw and float in the buffer. Sections were washed in PBS for 4 × 15 min (each wash). For immunostaining, sections were stained with the following primary antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-collagen IV (Abcam Cambridge, UK), polyclonal rabbit anti-Laminin (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Cheshire, UK), monoclonal hamster anti-Podoplanin (T1α) (Thermo Fischer Scientific, IL, USA) and polyclonal rabbit anti-Pro-SPC (Mercury, CA, USA). Sections were placed in a permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 2 h, transferred to a blocking solution [10% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (TX)] for 4 h, and incubated for 48 h at 4 °C with the primary antibodies. The anti-collagen IV and anti-podoplanin antibodies were diluted 1:500 in primary antibody cocktail (50% blocking buffer in 0.05% TX in PBS); the anti-laminin and anti-pro-SPC antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in a primary antibody cocktail. All primary antibodies were washed for 4 × 20 min in wash buffer (1% blocking buffer and 0.05% TX in PBS); the anti-collagen IV and anti-laminin antibodies were incubated with an Alexa Fluor-594 goat anti-rabbit (1:250) antibody; the anti-podoplanin antibody was incubated with an Alexa Fluor-594 goat anti-hamster (1:250) antibody; and the anti-pro-SPC antibody was incubated with an Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-rabbit (1:250) antibody for 48 h at 4 °C and washed for 4 × 20 min in wash buffer (the secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 488/594 and goat anti-hamster-Alexa Fluor 594 were purchased from Molecular Probes, OR, USA). Sections were further washed with PBS, 3 × 15 min, and then the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (0.3 µg/ml for 5 min.); washed for 3 × 15 min in PBS and mounted with Fluoromount-G and analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 710 Confocal Microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The severity score was based on fluorescence intensity quantification of the markers and was performed using Zen1 software (Zeiss).Antibiotics and treatment protocolsCiprofloxacin (Ciproxin, Bayer) was injected subcutaneously according to a regimen of 40 mg/kg once a day for 5 days.

Paul Thomas and colleagues have now characterized the distinct activation states that occur in lung fibroblasts during severe influenza virus infection. They report in Nature that excessive fibroblast activation characterized by upregulation of the protease ADAMTS4 is associated with immunopathology, reduced lung function and higher mortality in both mice and humans during influenza virus infection.During respiratory viral infections, much of the damage in the lungs is caused by infiltrating immune cells that kill both infected and bystander cells. As remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) facilitates immune cell entry, the authors set out to define the roles of stromal cell populations during an acute respiratory infection. They performed single-cell gene-expression profiling (scGEX) on CD45– stromal cells isolated from the lungs of mice infected with influenza A virus and found that fibroblasts showed particularly dynamic patterns of gene expression. Gene-set enrichment analysis identified three main functional fibroblast subsets: resting fibroblasts, ECM-synthesizing fibroblasts (ESFibs) and inflammatory fibroblasts.

The inflammatory fibroblasts showed high expression of genes associated with type I interferon, IL-6 or NF-κB signalling and could be further subdivided into two subsets, namely damage-responsive fibroblasts (DRFibs) and interferon-responsive fibroblasts (IRFibs). DRFibs were enriched for genes involved in tissue damage-response pathways and showed upregulation of Itga5 and downregulation of Cd9, whereas IRFibs were enriched in genes involved in type I interferon response pathways and showed upregulation of Bst2 and Cd9. Similar functional fibroblast subsets were also identified in human lung biopsy samples and, of note, the authors found ITGA5+CD9lo fibroblasts with a damage-responsive profile in patients who had died of respiratory failure but not in healthy donors. In vitro culture experiments suggested that IL-1α, IL-1β and TNF are important for fibroblast activation during influenza virus infection.The authors next examined how proteases produced by activated fibroblasts affect the response to influenza virus infection. They found that ADAMTS4 (which degrades the ECM proteoglycan versican) is one of the earliest proteases to be induced in the lungs of infected mice, is expressed throughout the course of infection and is almost exclusively expressed by fibroblasts. A meta-analysis of publically available scGEX human datasets indicated that DRFib-like cells show highest levels of ADAMTS4 expression and that ADAMTS4 is markedly upregulated in inflammatory lung diseases compared with in healthy lungs.Compared with controls, Adamts4–/– mice showed improved survival following a lethal dose of influenza virus, and this was associated with reduced inflammation and improved lung function. The lungs of infected Adamts4–/– mice also showed higher levels of intact versican, and a series of additional experiments suggested that degradation of versican by ADAMTS4-expressing DRFibs permits the recruitment of CD8+ T cells, which are one of the main drivers of immunopathology during influenza virus infection.Finally, the authors measured the levels of ADAMTS4 in respiratory tract samples from cohorts of paediatric or adult patients with moderate or severe influenza virus infection. They found that, across all age groups, levels of ADAMTS4 in the lower respiratory tract strongly correlated with increased risk for respiratory failure and death following severe influenza virus infection.targeting ADAMTS4 or other ECM proteases could improve clinical outcomes in patients who have developed ARDS in response to influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory infectionsThese findings indicate a crucial role for damage-responsive fibroblasts in regulating the magnitude of the immune response and the propensity to develop lung failure in response to severe respiratory infections. The authors propose that targeting ADAMTS4 or other ECM proteases could improve clinical outcomes in patients who have developed ARDS in response to influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory infections.

The symptoms may be hard to distinguish, given that all three conditions can result in a cough. But each has its own hallmarks. An August study from the University of Southern California identified a distinct order of symptoms among COVID-19 patients: Most symptomatic patients start with a fever, followed by a cough. For seasonal influenza, it's typically the opposite - people generally develop a cough before a fever. If you get a common cold, meanwhile, that's more likely to start with a sore throat as the first symptom, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Here's how to distinguish the novel coronavirus from the seasonal flu, allergies, and common cold.However, these symptom lists - and the order in which they arrive - aren't foolproof. Plenty of COVID-19 patients don't develop a fever at all, and some flu patients never come down with a cough. That's why it's also helpful to consider how quickly symptoms appear and how long they last. How COVID-19, flu, cold, and allergies manifest and progressCoronavirus cases tend to develop more gradually than the flu. While some people start showing COVID-19 symptoms within two days of being infected, the disease's symptoms can take up to two weeks to manifest. On average, people start to feel sick five days after they were infected. People with the flu, on the other hand, usually feel sick one to four days after exposure. Most patients then fully recover within less than two weeks, often as quickly as a few days. Many coronavirus patients recover within two weeks as well, but a growing share of patients have reported symptoms that last for months. Common cold symptoms, by contrast, usually reach their peak within within two to three days of infection - but, like the coronavirus, they often come on more gradually. Some cold symptoms last longer than others: Patients with a typical cold may have a sore throat for eight days, a headache for nine to 10 days, and congestion, a runny nose, or cough for more than two weeks. Allergies tend to last longer - about two to three weeks per allergen - and won't resolve until the allergen leaves the air. Seasonal allergies also tend to be more severe in the spring, though. The most common symptoms of each illnessCoronavirus cases run the gamut from asymptomatic to mild to severe. "I've never seen an infection with this broad range of manifestations," Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in July. Many patients have reported conditions that don't appear on the official CDC list, including hair loss, hiccups, rashes, and purple, swollen toes. A large share of COVID-19 patients lose their sense of taste or smell - this is perhaps the strongest predictor of a coronavirus infection, according to a June study from scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital and King's College London. A Spanish case study similarly found that nearly 40 percent of patients with COVID-19 developed smell and/or taste disorders, compared to just 12 percent of patients with the flu. Symptoms like a fever or headache could help rule out allergies or the common cold as well. People with colds, meanwhile, are more likely to develop a runny or stuffy nose than COVID-19 patients. And cold symptoms are milder overall. One of the hallmarks of allergies - itchy eyes - isn't associated with any of the other three illnesses. Ultimately, the best way to know if you have COVID-19 is to get a diagnostic test. Until results come back negative, people should stay home if they're feeling sick or were exposed to someone confirmed to have the virus. Everyone should also get a flu shot to minimise the risk of overcrowding at hospitals. "This will be, in my opinion, the most important flu season of our lifetimes," US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said at a September Senate hearing. "Less flu and fewer hospitalizations will help conserve precious healthcare resources." This article was originally published by Business Insider.

Face masks are effective at reducing the spread of viral respiratory infections like COVID-19 and the flu. Face masks are safe to use and not associated with an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia or other health problems. Reviewed content Verdict: Inaccurate Claim: “Most of the victims of the Spanish flu didn’t die from the Spanish flu. They died from bacterial pneumonia. And the bacterial pneumonia was caused by [...] wearing masks” Source: Facebook, Facebook users, 2020-10-23 Verdict detail Inaccurate: A 2008 scientific study co-authored by Anthony Fauci concluded that the majority of deaths during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, also known as the “Spanish flu,” likely resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia. However, there is no mention of masks in the study, nor did the study draw any causal association between bacterial pneumonia and mask use. Hence the claim that the study demonstrates that mask use causes bacterial pneumonia is false. Unsupported: Scientific evidence does not support the claim that mask use leads to a higher risk of bacterial pneumonia. See our method of evaluation Full Claim “In 2008, Dr. Anthony Fauci co-authored a paper about the Spanish flu […] They discovered that most of the victims of the Spanish flu didn’t die from the Spanish flu. They died from bacterial pneumonia. And the bacterial pneumonia was caused by… wait for it, wait for it…. wearing masks.” Review Misinformation about mask use has circulated since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Claims that wearing face masks increase the risk of infection are not new and were previously found to be inaccurate, as reported in Health Feedback reviews here and here. In October 2020, numerous social media posts on Facebook and Twitter claimed that the majority of “Spanish flu” deaths were due to bacterial pneumonia caused by wearing masks. The claim is based on a 2008 study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases and co-authored by Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases[1]. The 2008 study examined the causes of death for patients who died during the 1918-1919 flu pandemic, with the aim of improving future flu pandemic responses. It found that, “The majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory-tract bacteria.” Given this finding, the study proposed that, “pandemic planning needs to go beyond addressing the viral cause alone (e.g., influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs). Prevention, diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia, as well as stockpiling of antibiotics and bacterial vaccines, should also be high priorities for pandemic planning.” These findings are supported by numerous other studies that found that flu is associated with secondary infections from other viruses and bacteria, including bacterial pneumonia[2-6]. However, the 2008 study as well as these other studies do not mention mask use or that masks cause bacterial pneumonia. Multiple experts debunked the claim that masks cause bacterial pneumonia. Davidson Hamer, a professor of global health and medicine at Boston University stated, “There’s no evidence of masks leading to fungal or bacterial infections of the upper airway or the lower airway as in pneumonia.” Catharine Paules, an assistant professor at Pennsylvania State University and specialist in infectious diseases, also pointed out that there is no data to support the claim, “Masks trap in bacteria and fungus and make people more susceptible to bacterial or fungal pneumonia.” Taison Bell, an assistant professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in critical care and infectious diseases, stated that no association between bacterial pneumonia and mask use has been observed in any reputable study so far. In summary, the claim that the 2008 study by Fauci and co-authors observed a causal link between deaths from the Spanish flu due to bacterial pneumonia and the use of face masks is inaccurate. The study makes no mention of masks, and no scientific study to date establishes a causal association between mask use and increased risk of bacterial pneumonia in the general population.

Developed under the project “Provision of technical support for the One Health platform in Rwanda,” supported financially by USAID, the strategy documents will guide efforts to prevent and control each of the three priority zoonotic diseases in line with global standards and requirements. In 2018, Rwanda prioritized the top six priority zoonotic diseases from over 20 zoonotic diseases for inter-sectoral collaboration. The FAO project selected three priority zoonotic diseases from the six which are, Rabies, Rift Valley Fever and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) to support. The Multi-sectoral preparedness and contingency plans will assist the Government of Rwanda’s multi-sectoral, multidisciplinary approach to guide and strengthen systems to prevent, prepare, detect, respond to, and recover from primarily infectious diseases from the source, and will consequently minimize the potential occurrence and spread in humans and/or animals. Rwanda has achieved progress along the pathway to strengthen multi-sectoral coordination through the One Health approach under the support of USAID to Rwanda One Health Platform in which using the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tool the contingency and preparedness plans for the selected three priority zoonotic diseases were developed. The Strategic plan to control and eliminate rabies Rabies is a zoonotic disease. Rabies, present on all continents and endemic in most African and Asian countries, is a fatal zoonotic viral disease, transmitted to humans through contact (mainly bites and scratches) with infected animals, both domestic and wild. According to WHO, Rabies is estimated to cause at least 55 000 deaths per year worldwide and Dogs contribute 99 percent of human rabies deaths. The data from the Epidemic Surveillance and Response Division at Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC), indicate a total of 413 dog bites (average of 54 dog bites per month) were recorded and one death resulted in rabies countrywide from January to August 2016. The 10-year “Rwanda Strategic plan for control and elimination of Rabies (2020-2030)” will guide stepwise reduction of rabies burden through enhanced surveillance, prevention of rabies in dogs, prevention of rabies in humans. It aims at eliminating human dog-mediated rabies by the year 2030. The strategy provides a guide for systematic reduction of rabies risk through sustained mass dog vaccinations, pre and post-exposure prophylaxis and public education until the country is completely free of human dog-mediated rabies. Highly pathogenic avian influenza preparedness and Response plan Rwanda remains free from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and does not have any reported of a suspected case of avian influenza (H5N1) both in birds and humans. The disease outbreak was reported in South East Asia in late 2003. Rwanda is at risk for the pandemic threat especially after discovering the virus in Africa. As of 2018, Rwanda’s chicken population stood at 7.6 million, a two-fold increase from 2010 when the number was 3.5 million Poultry products are predominantly traditional. This sector is exposed to many animal diseases and the veterinary services are still under-developed. The “Preparedness and response plan for highly pathogenic avian influenza” aims to guide preparedness and courses of action for appropriate response in the event of avian influenza and pandemic influenza outbreak in Rwanda. The plan targets people who are involved in planning and in responding to avian and pandemic influenza such as decision-makers, health planners, policymakers, public health managers, hospital administrators, health care providers, essential service providers, veterinary services, local government units, people involved in the mass media and communications and other stakeholders. The Rift Valley Fever preparedness and Response Plan The “Rwanda Rift Valley Fever preparedness and Response Plan” is intended to serve as a national guideline to Rift Valley Fever (RVF) preparedness and response activities for Rwanda. Rift Valley Fever is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle, in which it produces abortions in pregnant animals and a high mortality rate in the new born. Humans are susceptible to infection through contact with infected material or mosquito bites. In Rwanda, clinical RVF was detected and reported for the first time in May 2018 in Eastern part of Rwanda particularly in Ngoma and Kirehe Districts. The recent RVF outbreaks in Kenya and Uganda has put Rwanda at a very high risk of RVF. The plan will provide guidance on the information, tasks, and procedures that would be necessary to facilitate the decision-making process.

Health experts say people should avoid touching sick or dead birds, and chicken and eggs are safe to eat if cooked thoroughly, as that kills the virus.Bird flu: What threat to humans?A poultry farm in Frodsham, north-west England, also has cases: a cull of 13,000 birds was ordered there on Monday. A smaller cull is under way at a farm in Kent, in the south-east, where the H5N2 avian influenza strain was detected this week.H5N8 has been detected in migratory birds from Russia. A huge cull was carried out on farms in Russia's western Kostroma region late last month, to contain an outbreak.The Dutch farms affected are just outside Nijmegen, 30km (19 miles) from the German border. Containment zones have been set up around the farms, as well as around the north German farm in Oland, Nordfriesland. Farmers have been urged to keep their poultry indoors.German public broadcaster NDR says more than 1,000 dead wild birds - mainly geese and ducks - have been found on the Nordfriesland coast, most likely infected with bird flu.Germany's worst bird flu outbreak was in 2016-2017, when more than 900,000 birds were culled nationally.The Netherlands is Europe's largest exporter of chicken meat and eggs, employing 10,000 people on 2,000 farms.The Dutch culled more than 30 million chickens, ducks and other fowl in a major bird flu outbreak in 2003, the BBC's Anna Holligan reports from The Hague.
