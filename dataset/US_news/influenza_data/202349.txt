Priority Groups for Antiviral Treatment of Influenza Antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for any patient with suspected or confirmed influenza who: is hospitalized; has severe, complicated, or progressive illness; or is at higher risk for influenza complications. Decisions about starting antiviral treatment for patients with suspected influenza should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza virus infection. Empiric antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible in the above priority groups. Clinicians can consider early empiric antiviral treatment of non-higher-risk outpatients with suspected influenza based upon clinical judgment if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Antiviral Drug Options For hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, initiation of antiviral treatment with oral or enterically administered oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible. For outpatients with complications or progressive disease and suspected or confirmed influenza (e.g., pneumonia, or exacerbation of underlying chronic medical conditions), initiation of antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible. For outpatients with suspected or confirmed uncomplicated influenza, oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir may be used for treatment, depending upon approved age groups and contraindications. In one randomized controlled trial, baloxavir had greater efficacy than oseltamivir in adolescents and adults with influenza B virus infection (Ison, 2020). Clinicians may also wish to consult: IDSA antiviral treatment and antiviral chemoprophylaxis recommendations ATS-IDSA Adult CAP Guidelines Co-circulation of Influenza Viruses and SARS-CoV-2 During periods of community co-circulation of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2, empiric antiviral treatment of influenza is recommended as soon as possible for the following priority groups: a) hospitalized patients with respiratory illness; b) outpatients with severe, complicated, or progressive respiratory illness; and c) outpatients at higher risk for influenza complications who present with any acute respiratory illness symptoms (with or without fever). Influenza and COVID-19 have overlapping signs and symptoms. Testing can help distinguish between influenza virus infection and SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, clinicians should not wait for the results of influenza testing (Nucleic Acid Detection Based Tests), SARS-CoV-2 testing, or multiplex molecular assays that detect influenza A and B viruses and SARS-CoV-2 (Multiplex Assays Authorized for Simultaneous Detection of Influenza Viruses and SARS-CoV-2 by FDA) to initiate empiric antiviral treatment for influenza in the above priority groups. Co-infection with influenza A or B viruses and SARS-CoV-2 can occur and should be considered, particularly in hospitalized patients with severe respiratory disease. Clinicians should be aware that a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result does not preclude influenza virus infection. For hospitalized patients with suspected influenza who are started on empiric antiviral treatment with oseltamivir, use of influenza molecular assays (Nucleic Acid Detection Based Tests) or multiplex assays that detect both influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 (Multiplex Assays Authorized for Simultaneous Detection of Influenza Viruses and SARS-CoV-2 by FDA) can inform clinical management. Clinicians should be aware that a positive influenza test result does not preclude SARS-CoV-2 infection. For hospitalized patients with a positive influenza test result, antiviral treatment of influenza with oseltamivir should be started as soon as possible, and clinicians should also follow guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (community acquired pneumonia treatment guidance for adults: Metlay, 2019) and other respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2 infection (IDSA Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19) if clinically indicated, while awaiting SARS-CoV-2 testing results. Oseltamivir does not have in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Choy, 2020). Clinicians can utilize telemedicine in place of office visits for patients with acute respiratory illness. It may be useful for providers to implement phone triage lines to enable high-risk patients to discuss symptoms over the phone. Algorithm to Assist in Medical Office Telephone Evaluation of Patients with Possible Influenza for Health Care Settings. Patients at higher risk for influenza complications should be advised to call their provider as soon as possible if they have acute respiratory illness symptoms (with or without fever) for consideration of infection with influenza A or B viruses (and early antiviral treatment), SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory pathogens. Clinicians can consider starting early (≤48 hours after illness onset) empiric antiviral treatment of non-higher-risk outpatients with suspected influenza, based upon clinical judgment, including without an office visit. SARS-CoV-2 and other etiologies of acute respiratory illness should also be considered. Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19 are available. Clinical algorithms for the testing and treatment of influenza when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are circulating are available. Overview of Influenza Antiviral Medications Antiviral medications with activity against influenza viruses are an important adjunct to influenza vaccine in the control of influenza. Influenza antiviral prescription drugs can be used to treat influenza, and some can be used to prevent influenza. Six licensed prescription influenza antiviral drugs are approved in the United States. Four influenza antiviral medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are recommended for use in the United States. Three drugs are chemically related antiviral medications known as neuraminidase inhibitors that block the viral neuraminidase enzyme and have activity against both influenza A and B viruses: oral oseltamivir phosphate (available as a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu®), inhaled zanamivir (trade name Relenza®), and intravenous peramivir (trade name Rapivab®). The fourth drug is oral baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza®), which is active against both influenza A and B viruses but has a different mechanism of action than neuraminidase inhibitors. Baloxavir is a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor that interferes with viral RNA transcription and blocks virus replication. More information regarding the four recommended antiviral medications is available: Table 1. The two other FDA-approved influenza antiviral medications (amantadine and rimantadine) are not recommended for antiviral treatment or chemoprophylaxis because of high levels of resistance among circulating influenza A viruses. Clinical trials and observational data show that early antiviral treatment can shorten the duration of fever and illness symptoms, and may reduce the risk of some complications from influenza (e.g., otitis media in young children, pneumonia, and respiratory failure). In hospitalized adults with influenza, early treatment with oseltamivir has been reported to reduce in-hospital death and the duration of hospitalization in some observational studies. In hospitalized children, early antiviral treatment with oseltamivir has been reported to shorten the duration of hospitalization in some observational studies. Clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is administered early, especially within 48 hours of influenza illness onset.

Antiviral Medications Recommended for Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Influenza [41 KB, 2 pages] Abbreviations: N/A = not applicable, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Oral oseltamivir phosphate is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 14 days and older, and for chemoprophylaxis in people 1 year and older. Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants less than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year, is recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics. If a child is younger than 3 months old, use of oseltamivir for chemoprophylaxis is not recommended unless the situation is judged critical due to limited data in this age group. Self-injury or delirium; mainly reported among Japanese pediatric patients. Inhaled zanamivir is contraindicated in patients with underlying airways disease such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and those with a history of allergy to lactose or milk protein. Intravenous peramivir is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 6 months and older. Peramivir efficacy is based on clinical trials versus placebo in which the predominant influenza virus type was influenza A; in one trial, a very limited number of subjects infected with influenza B virus were enrolled. There are no data available for use of peramivir for chemoprophylaxis of influenza. Oral baloxavir marboxil is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people aged ≥5 years who are otherwise healthy, or in people aged ≥12 years who are high risk of developing influenza-related complications. Baloxavir efficacy for initial FDA approval in October 2018 was based on clinical trials in previously healthy outpatients 12 to 64 years old (Hayden, 2018). Singledose baloxavir t reatment was superior to placebo and had similar clinical efficacy in time to alleviation of symptoms to a 5-day treatment course of oseltamivir. In October 2019, FDA approved an indication for baloxavir treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12 years and older at high risk of developing influenza-related complications, based upon the findings of a clinical trial (Ison, 2020). In this clinical trial of early initiation of antiviral treatment for uncomplicated influenza in higher risk patients, baloxavir was superior to placebo and had similar overall efficacy to oseltamivir in the time to alleviation of symptoms. For patients with influenza B virus infection, baloxavir significantly reduced the median time to improvement of symptoms compared with oseltamivir by more than 24 hours. For patients with influenza B virus infection, baloxavir significantly reduced the median time to improvement of symptoms compared with oseltamivir by more than 24 hours. However, there are no available data for baloxavir treatment of influenza in pregnant people, immunocompromised people, or in people with severe influenza who are not hospitalized. In August 2022, FDA expanded approval of baloxavir for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in children aged 5 years to <11 years who are otherwise healthy package insert XOFLUZA. This was based upon the secondary clinical outcomes of a randomized clinical trial of baloxavir versus oseltamivir for treatment of uncomplicated influenza in children aged 1 year to <12 years (Baker, 2021). A randomized clinical trial reported that combination neuraminidase inhibitor (primarily oseltamivir) and baloxavir for treatment of hospitalized influenza patients aged ≥12 years did not result in superior clinical benefit (time to clinical improvement) compared with neuraminidase inhibitor and placebo (Kumar, 2022). In November 2020, FDA expanded approval of baloxavir to include post exposure prophylaxis of influenza for persons aged ≥12 years within 48 hours of contact with an individual with influenza, based on the findings of a clinical trial among household contacts of index patient with influenza (Ikematsu, 2020). In this study, baloxavir post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of influenza in household members (19% were younger than 12 years; 73% received baloxavir within 24 hours of onset of symptoms in the index household case who received antiviral treatment) significantly reduced the risk of laboratory confirmed by 86% among those who received baloxavir PEP than among those who received placebo (1.9% [7 of 374] vs. 13.6% [51 of 375]; adjusted risk ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.30; P<0.001). In August 2022, FDA expanded approval of baloxavir for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in persons aged 5 years and older within 48 hours of contact with an individual with influenza package insert XOFLUZA. Summary of Influenza Antiviral Treatment Recommendations Antiviral treatment is recommended as early as possible for any patient with confirmed or suspected influenza who: is hospitalized;A has severe, complicated, or progressive illness; orA is at higher risk for influenza complications. Oral oseltamivir is preferred for treatment of pregnant people (Rasmussen, 2009; Rasmussen, 2011). Pregnant people are recommended to receive the same antiviral dosing as non-pregnant people. Multiple studies have reported safe use of neuraminidase inhibitors during pregnancy (Dunstan, 2014; Xie, 2013; Saito, 2013; Wollenhaupt, 2014; Beau, 2014; Svensson, 2011; Greer, 2010; Graner, 2017; Ehrenstien, 2018; Chambers, 2019; Bennekom, 2019; ACOG Committee, 2018). Recommendations for Obstetric Health Care Providers Related to Use of Antiviral Medications in the Treatment and Prevention of Influenza for additional information. Baloxavir is not recommended for the treatment of influenza in pregnant or breastfeeding people, as there are no available efficacy or safety data for baloxavir in this pregnant people (Chow, 2021), and no available data on the presence of baloxavir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. CDC does not recommend use of baloxavir for monotherapy of influenza in severely immunosuppressed persons. There are no available efficacy, safety, or resistance data for baloxavir monotherapy of influenza in severely immunosuppressed patients and emergence of resistance during treatment is a concern because of prolonged influenza viral replication in these patients. When indicated, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset for the greatest clinical benefit. However, observational studies have reported that antiviral treatment of influenza can have clinical benefit in patients with severe, complicated or progressive illness, and in hospitalized patients when started after 48 hours of illness onset. Decisions about starting antiviral treatment should not wait for laboratory confirmation of influenza. Clinical benefit is greatest when antiviral treatment is started as close to illness onset as possible. Antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir also can be considered for any previously healthy, symptomatic outpatient not at higher risk for influenza complications, who is diagnosed with confirmed or suspected influenza, on the basis of clinical judgment, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. The recommended treatment course for uncomplicated influenza is two doses per day of oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for 5 days, or one dose of intravenous peramivir or oral baloxavir for 1 day. While influenza vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza illness, a history of influenza vaccination does not rule out the possibility of influenza virus infection in an ill patient with clinical signs and symptoms compatible with influenza. Figure: Guide for considering influenza testing and treatment when influenza viruses are circulating in the community (regardless of influenza vaccination history)1 Flow chart Guide for Considering Influenza Testing and Treatment When Influenza Viruses are Circulating in the Community Does the patient have signs and symptoms suggestive of influenza, including atypical clinical presentation, or findings suggestive of complications associated with influenza?2,3 No: Influenza testing probably not indicated; consider other etiologies Yes: Is the Patient being admitted to the hospital?Show Text Description Keep Reading: Guide for considering influenza testing when influenza viruses are circulating in the community People at Higher Risk for Influenza Complications Recommended for Antiviral Treatment Keep Reading: People at Increased Risk for Flu Complications Treatment Considerations for Patients Hospitalized with Suspected or Confirmed Influenza The following recommendations do not necessarily represent FDA-approved uses of antiviral products but are based on published observational studies and expert opinion and are subject to change as the developmental status of investigational products and the epidemiologic and virologic features of influenza change over time. For hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, initiation of antiviral treatment with oral or enterically administered oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible. Antiviral treatment might be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in hospitalized influenza patients, especially adults, even if treatment is started more than 48 hours after onset of illness. Inhaled zanamivir, oral baloxavir, and intravenous peramivir are not recommended routinely for hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza because of insufficient data on use of these antivirals showing clinical benefit in hospitalized influenza patients. There are also insufficient data for treatment of hospitalized influenza patients with intravenous peramivir. The optimal duration and dosing of antiviral treatment are uncertain for severe or complicated influenza. Treatment regimens might need to be altered to fit the clinical circumstances. Decisions about extended (longer) duration of treatment should be guided by clinical judgment in patients whose illness is prolonged. Virologic testing of lower respiratory tract specimens by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can help guide decisions about extended treatment in hospitalized influenza patients with severe and prolonged illness. Critically ill patients with respiratory failure can have prolonged influenza viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and might benefit from longer duration of treatment. Longer treatment regimens might be necessary in immunocompromised patients who may have prolonged influenza viral replication. Such patients are at risk of emergence of influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or antiviral resistance during or after antiviral treatment. A higher dose of oral or enterically administered oseltamivir has been recommended by some experts (e.g., 150 mg twice daily in adults with normal renal function) for treatment of influenza in immunocompromised patients and in severely ill hospitalized patients. However, oral or enterically administered oseltamivir at standard doses has been reported to be adequately absorbed in critically ill adults to therapeutic blood levels (Ariano, 2010), and available data suggest that higher dosing may not provide additional clinical benefit (Abdel-Ghafar, 2008; Ariano, 2010; Kumar, 2010; Lee, 2013; South East Asia Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network, 2013). Studies indicate that exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate (the active metabolite of oseltamivir) is similar between obese and non-obese subjects for both 75 mg and 150 mg doses given twice daily (Ariano, 2010; Jittamala, 2014; Pai, 2011; Thorne-Humphrey, 2011). Limited data suggest that oseltamivir administered orally or by oroaso gastric tube is well absorbed in critically ill influenza patients, including those receiving continuous renal replacement therapy, and/or on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Ariano, 2010; Eyler, 2012a; Eyler, 2012b; Giraud, 2011; Kromdijk, 2013; Lemaitre, 2012; Mulla, 2013; Taylor, 2008). If a hospitalized patient treated with oseltamivir or peramivir manifests progressive lower respiratory symptoms, resistant virus should be considered. However, clinicians should note that failure to improve or clinical deterioration during oseltamivir or peramivir treatment is more likely to be related to the natural history of acute lung injury and inflammatory damage or onset of other complications (e.g., renal failure, septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia) than to emergence of oseltamivir or peramivir resistance. Careful attention to ventilator and fluid management and to the prevention and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia (e.g., S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. aureus, including MRSA) also is critical for severely ill patients (Bautista, 2010; Finelli, 2008; Hageman, 2006; Harper, 2009; Mandell, 2007; Mauad, 2010; Shieh, 2010).

Chemoprophylaxis9 FDA approved for post-exposure prophylaxis for persons aged 5 years and older. Dosage is the same as for treatment. Recommended Dosage and Duration of Influenza Antiviral Medications for Treatment or Chemoprophylaxis Antiviral-Medications-Table2 Jan. 24, 2024 Download DownloadAbbreviations: N/A = not approved Longer treatment duration may be needed for severely ill patients. Oral oseltamivir is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset with twice-daily dosing in people 14 days and older, and for chemoprophylaxis with once-daily dosing in people 1 year and older. Although not part of the FDA-approved indications, use of oral oseltamivir for treatment of influenza in infants less than 14 days old, and for chemoprophylaxis in infants 3 months to 1 year of age, is recommended by CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (Recommendations for Prevention and Control of Influenza in Children, 2023–2024). This is the FDA-approved oral oseltamivir treatment dose for infants 14 days and older and less than 1 year old and provides oseltamivir exposure in children similar to that achieved by the approved dose of 75 mg orally twice daily for adults, as shown in two studies of oseltamivir pharmacokinetics in children (Kimberlin, 2013 [CASG 114], EU study WP2284, FDA Clinical Pharmacology Review). The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended an oseltamivir treatment dose of 3.5 mg/kg orally twice daily for infants 9-11 months old, on the basis of data which indicated that a higher dose of 3.5 mg/kg was needed to achieve the protocol-defined targeted exposure for this cohort as defined in the CASG 114 study (Kimberlin, 2013). It is unknown whether this higher dose will improve efficacy or prevent the development of antiviral resistance. However, there is no evidence that the 3.5 mg/kg dose is harmful or causes more adverse events to infants in this age group. Current weight-based dosing recommendations are not appropriate for premature infants. Premature infants might have slower clearance of oral oseltamivir because of immature renal function, and doses recommended for full-term infants might lead to very high drug concentrations in this age group. CDC recommends dosing as also recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)-United States, 2024-25): limited data from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group provide the basis for dosing preterm infants using their postmenstrual age (gestational age + chronological age): 1.0 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those <38 weeks postmenstrual age; 1.5 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those 38 through 40 weeks postmenstrual age; 3.0 mg/kg/dose, orally, twice daily, for those >40 weeks postmenstrual age. Special Considerations for Institutional Settings section for details regarding duration of chemoprophylaxis for outbreaks in institutional settings. Inhaled zanamivir is approved for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset with twice-daily dosing in people aged ≥7 years, and for chemoprophylaxis with once-daily dosing in people aged ≥5 years. Intravenous peramivir is approved for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset with a single dose in people aged ≥6 months. Daily dosing for a minimum of 5 days was used in clinical trials of hospitalized patients with influenza (de Jong, 2014, Ison, 2014). There are no data for use of peramivir for chemoprophylaxis of influenza. Oral baloxavir marboxil is approved by the FDA for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people aged ≥5 years who are otherwise healthy, or in people aged ≥12 years at high risk of developing influenza-related complications. Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) [package insert]. Baloxavir marboxil should not be administered with dairy products, calcium-fortified beverages, polyvalent cation-containing laxatives, antacids or oral supplements (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, or zinc); co-administration with polyvalent cation-containing products may decrease plasma concentrations of baloxavir which may reduce efficacy. There are no available published data from clinical trials for baloxavir treatment of influenza in non-hospitalized patients who are pregnant, immunocompromised, or have severe disease. A randomized clinical trial reported that combination neuraminidase inhibitor (primarily oseltamivir) and baloxavir for treatment of hospitalized influenza patients aged ≥12 years did not result in superior clinical benefit (time to clinical improvement) compared with neuraminidase inhibitor and placebo (Kumar, 2022). Oral baloxavir is approved by the FDA for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza for persons aged ≥5 years within 48 hours of contact with an individual with influenza. Influenza Antiviral Resistance Considerations Antiviral resistance and reduced susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors and to baloxavir among circulating influenza viruses is currently very low, but this can change. Weekly surveillance data on susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to antivirals in the U.S. this season, FluView Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report is available. Influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility or resistance to antivirals can occur sporadically (Hurt, 2011; Takashita, 2013; Takashita, 2014) or emerge during or after antiviral treatment in some patients (e.g., immunocompromised). Oseltamivir resistance in influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses can develop during treatment, particularly in young children (Roosenhoff, 2019; Lina, 2018;), and immunocompromised persons (Memoli, 2014). Influenza viruses may become less susceptible or resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir during antiviral treatment with one of these drugs and remain susceptible to zanamivir; this has been reported most often for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (Graitcer, 2011; Lackenby, 2011; Memoli, 2010; Nguyen, 2010; Nguyen, 2012). Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have also emerged that are resistant to all neuraminidase inhibitors, including zanamivir, in highly immunosuppressed patients on prolonged neuraminidase inhibitor treatment (Tamura, 2015; L'Huillier, 2015). Human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with an H275Y mutation in viral neuraminidase conferring resistance to oseltamivir has been reported among severely immunocompromised patients in hospital units, (Gooskens, 2009; Chen, 2011;) and in the community (Hibino, 2017; Le, 2008; Hurt, 2011; Hurt, 2012; Takashita, 2013), but currently appears to be uncommon. Following treatment with baloxavir, emergence of viruses with molecular markers associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir has been observed in clinical trials in immunocompetent children and adults, with higher detection among baloxavir-treated pediatric patients aged <12 years compared with adults (Hayden, 2018; Omoto, 2018; Hirostu, 2019; Uehara, 2019; Takashita, 2019). Limited human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H3N2) virus with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir has been reported sporadically in Japanese children (Takashita, 2019; Takashita 2019; Imai, 2019), but currently appears to be uncommon. Molecular analyses can detect genetic changes in influenza viruses associated with resistance and reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir and peramivir. The CDC Influenza Division is available for consultation regarding antiviral susceptibility testing as needed. Information about neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility testing and interpretation of results of neuraminidase inhibition assays is available on the WHO website. Antiviral Treatment Efficacy and Effectiveness Patients with Uncomplicated Influenza Meta-analyses of randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated efficacy of early initiation of treatment (started within 36 to 48 hours of illness onset) with neuraminidase inhibitors in reducing duration of fever and illness symptoms compared with placebo in otherwise healthy children and adults with uncomplicated influenza ( Jefferson, 2014; Dobson, 2015; Malosh, 2018; Liu, 2021). One randomized clinical trial in children with uncomplicated influenza demonstrated a modest reduction in duration of symptoms and influenza virus shedding in patients initiating treatment after 48 hours; post hoc analysis suggested that oseltamivir treatment initiated 72 hours after illness onset reduced symptoms by one day compared with placebo (Fry, 2014). A meta-analysis of RCTs comparing early treatment with oseltamivir to placebo or nonactive controls among adults and adolescents with uncomplicated influenza found no reduction in the risk of subsequent hospitalization with influenza but was underpowered to detect an effect given the very low rate of hospitalization among the trial populations (Hanula 2023; Antoon 2023; Uyeki 2023). RCTs and a meta-analysis of RCTs comparing baloxavir to placebo or oseltamivir among children and adults with uncomplicated influenza found that baloxavir was superior to placebo and comparable to oseltamivir in reducing symptom duration (Kuo, 2021; Portsmouth 2021). There are no available data on the use of baloxavir for treatment of influenza more than 2 days after illness onset in outpatients. Hospitalized Patients No completed, sufficiently powered, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials have been conducted of monotherapy with neuraminidase inhibitors for treatment of influenza in hospitalized patients; studies supporting the licensure of oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, intravenous peramivir, or oral baloxavir were conducted in outpatients, primarily among previously healthy persons with uncomplicated illness. A secondary analysis of a multi-center unblinded clinical trial of oseltamivir treatment started within 24 hours of enrollment after hospital admission versus standard of care in adults hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infection reported that oseltamivir treatment lowered the risk of clinical failure in patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza; clinical failure was defined as failure to improve with 7 days, transfer to ICU care 24 hours after admission, or rehospitalization or death within 30 days (Wiemken, 2021). Several observational studies in hospitalized influenza patients have shown clinical benefit of neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral treatment compared with no treatment, particularly when started within two days of illness onset, or as soon as possible after hospital admission, including reducing the duration of hospitalization, and reducing the risk of ICU transfer, invasive mechanical ventilation or risk of death (Coffin, 2011; Hsu, 2012; Louie, 2013; Muthuri, 2013; Muthuri, 2014; Miyakawa, 2019; Lytras, 2019; Chen, 2020; Chen, 2020; Venkatesan, 2020; Katzen, 2019; Reacher, 2019; Walsh, 2022). Some observational studies have reported that oral oseltamivir treatment started 4 and 5 days after illness onset in patients hospitalized with suspected or confirmed influenza was associated with lower risk of death (EH Lee, 2010; N Lee, 2008; N Lee, 2010; Louie, 2012; McGeer, 2007), although one report found this benefit only in hospitalized adult patients in the ICU (Muthuri, 2014). A small number of observational studies and one meta-analysis of observational studies of hospitalized influenza patients reported that neuraminidase inhibitor treatment was not associated with a reduction in risk of death (Choi, 2017; Wolkewitz, 2016; Heneghan, 2016). One randomized clinical trial reported that combination neuraminidase inhibitor (primarily oseltamivir) and baloxavir treatment of hospitalized influenza patients aged ≥12 years did not result in superior clinical benefit (time to clinical improvement) compared to treatment with neuraminidase inhibitor and placebo, indicating that adding baloxavir did not result in additional clinical benefit, but significantly reduced nasopharyngeal influenza viral RNA levels (Kumar, 2022). Observational studies in hospitalized patients with influenza have reported that clinical benefit is greatest when oseltamivir is started within 48 hours of illness onset (Hsu, 2012; Louie, 2013; Muthuri, 2013; Muthuri, 2014). However, some studies suggest that antiviral treatment might still be beneficial in hospitalized patients when started up to 4 or 5 days after illness onset (Louie, 2012; Yu, 2011). In pregnant people, antiviral treatment in any trimester with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection has been shown to be most beneficial in preventing respiratory failure and death when started within 2 days of illness (Siston, 2010). Observational studies in hospitalized patients with influenza have reported greater clinical benefit when oseltamivir or other neuraminidase inhibitor treatment are started at or promptly after hospital admission compared with later treatment initiation or no antiviral treatment (Katzen, 2018, Venkatesan, 2019). Observational studies in hospitalized adult patients with influenza have reported that starting oseltamivir treatment within 48 hours of hospital admission can reduce ICU admission, 30-day readmissions and mortality compared with no treatment or later initiation of treatment (Sharma 2021, Groeneveld 2020). Duration of Treatment or Chemoprophylaxis Treatment: Recommended duration for antiviral treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients is 5 days for oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir. For treatment of uncomplicated influenza with intravenous peramivir or oral baloxavir, a single dose is recommended. Longer daily dosing (oral oseltamivir or intravenous peramivir) can be considered for hospitalized patients with influenza who remain severely ill after 5 days of treatment. Treatment should be started as soon as possible after symptom onset for the greatest clinical benefit. Chemoprophylaxis: Recommended duration is 7 days (after last known exposure). For control of outbreaks in institutional settings (e.g., long-term care facilities for older adults and children) and hospitals, CDC recommends antiviral chemoprophylaxis of exposed residents with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir for a minimum of 2 weeks and continuing up to 1 week after the last known case was identified. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all residents, including those who have received influenza vaccination. For control of some institutional influenza outbreaks, post-exposure antiviral treatment has been used (e.g., oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days) instead of post-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis (Uyeki, 2019). Baloxavir is approved for post-exposure prophylaxis (single dose) of influenza in persons aged 5 years and older within 48 hours of contact with an individual with influenza. Dosing in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Dose adjustment of oseltamivir is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance between 10 and 60 mL/min and patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis or continuous peritoneal dialysis receiving oseltamivir for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza. Oseltamivir is not recommended for patients with ESRD not undergoing dialysis. The recommended doses are detailed in Table 3; duration of treatment and chemoprophylaxis is the same as recommended for patients with normal renal function. The dose of intravenous peramivir should be reduced for patients with baseline creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min. No dose adjustment is recommended for inhaled zanamivir for a 5-day course of treatment for patients with renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir in patients with creatinine clearance 50 mL/min and above. The effects of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil or its active metabolite, baloxavir, have not been evaluated. Table 3.

However, these tables may be useful for children who qualify for adult doses based on weight >40 kg. Assuming 3 hemodialysis sessions are performed in the 5- day period. Treatment can be initiated immediately if influenza symptoms develop during the 48 hours between hemodialysis sessions; however, the post-hemodialysis dose should still be administered independently of time of administration of the initial dose. An initial dose can be administered prior to the start of dialysis. Data derived from studies in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Renal dosing from peramivir package insert is available for pediatric patients: Creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min: 12 mg/kg (up to maximum dose of 600 mg); Creatinine clearance 30 to 49 mL/min: 4 mg/kg; Creatinine clearance 10 to 29 mL/min: 2 mg/kg. Adverse Events When considering use of influenza antiviral medications, clinicians must consider the patient's age, weight and renal function; presence of other medical conditions; indications for use (i.e., chemoprophylaxis or therapy); and the potential for interaction with other medications. Some RCTs and meta-analyses of RCTs have indicated that gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting are increased with oral oseltamivir compared with placebo; these adverse events may be less likely when oseltamivir is taken with food (Aoki, 2003; Malosh, 2018; Dobson, 2015, Liu, 2021). An RCT of empiric oseltamivir treatment compared to placebo in children 0-9 years of age hospitalized with acute respiratory illness, including >300 infants <1 year of age, found no difference in rates of vomiting or other gastrointestinal symptoms (Dawood, 2016).

Keep Reading: Antiviral Adverse Events Drug Interactions Co-administration of baloxavir with polyvalent cation-containing products may decrease plasma concentrations of baloxavir which may reduce efficacy. Avoid co-administration of baloxavir with polyvalent cation-containing laxatives, antacids, or oral supplements (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium, selenium, or zinc). Concurrent administration of antiviral drugs with intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) may inhibit viral replication of LAIV and thereby decrease the effectiveness of LAIV vaccination. LAIV should not be given if oseltamivir or zanamivir was administered within 48 hours of planned vaccination, or if peramivir was administered within 5 days of planned vaccination, or if baloxavir was administered within 17 days of planned vaccination. If LAIV is given, and antiviral medications are subsequently administered up to two weeks after vaccination, the effectiveness of LAIV might be reduced, and persons who receive these antiviral medications within two weeks after receiving LAIV should be revaccinated with another appropriate influenza vaccine (e.g., IIV or RIV4).

For hospitalized patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral or enterically administered oseltamivir because of suspected or known gastric stasis, malabsorption, or gastrointestinal bleeding, intravenous peramivir may be considered (Lee, 2017; de Jong, 2014; Ison, 2014; Ison, 2013). There are insufficient data to support general use of inhaled zanamivir and intravenous peramivir in patients with severe influenza disease. There are no available data from clinical trials on use of baloxavir treatment in patients with severe influenza disease who are not hospitalized. Oral oseltamivir and oral baloxavir are available treatment options for patients at higher risk for influenza complication depending upon their underlying conditions and age (Table 1). Data on use of peramivir or zanamivir are very limited in high-risk outpatients with influenza.

Cav1.2 is a specific voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) important for the internalization of IAV and VDCC inhibitors can decrease IAV disease severity in mice. In this paper, the distribution pattern of a range of VDCCs by immunohistochemistry and Cav1.2 by in situ hybridization in the porcine respiratory tract is documented for the first time. Furthermore, we showed co-localization of VDCC-positive and IAV-positive cells in experimentally infected pigs. These findings provide new perspectives on the IAV internalization process and pave the way for further research investigating the effect of VDDC inhibitors on the IAV infection dynamics in pigs, which could have relevance to humans too.

The main IAV receptors are sialic acids (SA) that are linked to glycoproteins in either an alpha 2,3- (α2,3) or alpha 2,6-linkage (α2,6). IAVs isolated from humans and pigs prefer binding to SA-α2,6 while IAVs isolated from birds prefer binding to SA-α2,31,2,3. Most IAVs seem to be species-specific and although humans and pigs have similar receptor distribution in their respiratory tract4,5, it is only some IAV strains that can be transmitted between pigs and humans6. This indicates that other factors are important for effective replication in a new host species. Such factors could be physical factors such as differences in temperatures, pH values, and host proteases in the respiratory tract7,8,9. Sporadic interspecies transmission of swine IAVs to humans most often results in dead-end transmissions, however, the most recent IAV pandemic (H1N1pdm09) occurred due to reassortment events in pigs10,11. The H1N1pdm09 became established in both pigs and humans and it has since then increased the diversity of swine IAVs dramatically, which has complicated the surveillance of IAVs6,12,13. Hence, a complete understanding of the swine and human IAV pathogenesis, to identify possible host factors that allow interspecies transmission, is needed to identify potential zoonotic swine IAVs.Calcium channels have recently been shown to be important for the internalization of IAV and other human respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, measles, and rhinovirus14. Additionally, the presence of extracellular calcium is important for the internalization and replication of IAV, which has been demonstrated by adding ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA, Ca2+ chelator)15,16 and by using specific voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) blockers17,18. VDCCs consist of three families Cav1 (L-type), Cav2 (P/Q, N, and R-types), and Cav3 (T-type). Common to all families of VDCCs is that stimulation by a voltage signal results in an extracellular calcium influx and they consist of an α1 subunit, which is the pore-forming unit of the VDCCs19. One of the L-type VDCC α1 subunits is Cav1.2 and it contains four N-glycosylations sites, which can attach terminal SA20. Furthermore, it has been shown that hemagglutinin, the surface protein important for the attachment of IAV to cells, binds to Cav1.2. Interestingly, this binding was significantly reduced by a sialidase pre-treatment, but not by adding EGTA, indicating that the sialic acids of Cav1.2 are important for viral attachment18. Moreover, Fujioka et al.18 showed that a knockdown of Cav1.2 significantly reduced IAV internalization. Overall, the previous studies strongly suggest that Cav1.2 is an important factor in the internalization of IAV. Additionally, treatment of mice with Diltiazem, a specific Cav1.2 inhibitor, significantly decreased the disease severity of IAV18,21. FDA has approved Diltiazem for the treatment of hypertension and coronary artery spasm22 and, therefore, a phase II clinical trial on Diltiazem as a treatment for severe IAV was already initiated in 201723, however, the results of these trials are still pending.Cav1.2 has been detected by in situ methods in the lower respiratory tract in fetal lungs of humans and mice24, in adult cardiomyocytes of mice25 and rats26, and in adult murine brain tissues21. Furthermore, the Cav1 and Cav2 families of VDCCs have been recognized by CavPan α1-antibodies in the adult murine lung by immunohistochemistry (IHC)14. In the present report, we document for the first time, the presence of Cav1 and Cav2 families by CavPan α1-antibodies and specifically Cav1.2 by in situ hybridization in the respiratory tract of pigs. These findings provide new perspectives on the swine IAV internalization process and open up for further investigation on the effect of VDCC-blockers as a treatment for IAV in pigs, which potentially could be translatable to humans.MethodsEthics declarationThe porcine and murine tissues originated from two experimental studies27,28 approved by the Danish Animal Experimentation Council (protocol no. 2020-15-0201-00502 and no. 2012-15-2934-00256, respectively).VDCC and IAV IHCImmunohistochemically, CavPan α1-antibodies stain the α1 genes from the Cav1 and Cav2 families and are therefore considered a pan-reactive VDCC reagent. The amino acid sequence used to produce the CavPan α1-antibody corresponds to amino acids 1506 to 1524 of the rat Cav1.2 and was compared to the corresponding amino acid sequences of Cav1.2 from pig, mouse, human, guinea pig, ferret, chicken, and duck origin.Heart, nose, trachea, and lung tissues from six to seven-week-old pigs (N = 3, one control pig and two IAV-inoculated pigs) were used for the examination of VDCC immunohistochemically, together with brain tissue from one adult mouse, which was used as a positive control. The formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin wax and sliced into 2–3 µm sections. The sections were deparaffinized and after each of the following steps, the sections were washed two times for 5 min in tris-buffered saline (TBS). The sections were blocked by endogen peroxidase 0.6% (CAS: 7722-84-1, VWR International, Søborg, Denmark), pre-treated with 0.1% trypsin, and blocked with ultra v-block (TL-125-HLJ, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). CavPan α1-antibody (ACC-004, Almone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) diluted 1:2000 was added to the sections overnight at 4 °C. The method of detection was Ultravision ONE HRP polymer reagent (TL-125-HLJ, Thermo Scientific) which was added to the sections for 30 min. A pre-adsorption control was performed as described above, but by mixing the CavPan α1 blocking peptide (BLP-CC004, Almone Labs) and the CavPan α1-antibody. An isotype control (IgG) (X0903, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA), diluted to the same content of protein as the primary reagent in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/TBS, instead of CavPan α1-antibody was also performed. The staining was developed by adding 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) for 6 min, and sections were counterstained by Mayer’s hematoxylin (AMPQ00254.5000, VWR International, Radnor, Pennsylvania, USA) and mounted with glycerol-gelatine.At least two representative images of each of the tissues and lung compartments (bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli) were acquired. Lamina epithelialis in the nose, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli was manually selected as a region of interest (ROI) in ImageJ29. The percentage of pixels above the threshold in the selected area (% area) was calculated by using the plugin “Color Deconvolution2” and by setting a threshold of 126 for hematoxylin and 120 for DAB30. The % area of CavPan α1 DAB was normalized to hematoxylin (% area DAB/% area hematoxylin) and the % area of isotype DAB normalized to hematoxylin was subtracted.Parallel sections of two IAV-infected pigs, inoculated with an IAV circulating in pigs (swine-adapted) and an IAV circulating in humans (human-adapted), were stained for IAV in the nose, trachea, and lung tissues. The sections were deparaffinized and blocked for endogenous peroxidase as described above and hereafter pretreated with 0.018 g proteinase (P8038, Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) diluted in 100 ml TBS for 5 min. Additionally, the sections were blocked for 5 min by Ultra V Block (TA-125-UB, Epredia, Michigan, United States) and anti-IAV (nucleoprotein (NP)) antibodies (HYB 340-05, SSI-antibodies, Copenhagen S, Denmark) diluted 1:50000 in 1% BSA/TBS were added to the sections overnight at 4 °C. A Primary Antibody Enhancer (TL-125-PB, Epredia) was added to the sections for 20 min followed by a Large Volume HRP Polymer (TL-125-PH, Epredia) for 30 min. The staining was developed by adding AEC vector (SK-4200, Vector Laboratories, California, USA) for 10 min and counterstaining by Mayer’s hematoxylin (AMPQ00254.5000, VWR International). The sections were mounted with glycerol-gelatine.Cav.1.2 Reverse transcriptase-qPCRThe presence of Cav1.2, in frozen lung tissue, obtained from three pigs that had tested negative for IAV, and in HEK 293 T cells was investigated. The HEK 293 T cells were used as a positive control for the reverse transcriptase-qPCR (RT-qPCR) assay since the Cav1.2 channels previously have been documented in these cells18. Briefly, 200 µl of HEK 293 T cells with Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Gibco) were collected and treated as previously described for nasal swabs31. RLT-buffer (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) which contained 2-mercaptoethanol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to 70 mg frozen lung tissues, lysed in TissueLyser LT (QIAGEN) at 30 Hz for 3 min and centrifuged at 9651 × g for 3 min. The RNA extraction was performed as described previously31. RT-qPCR was performed by using Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) with primers for Cav1.2 developed by ref. 18. The PCR cycles were as follows: 50 °C for 40 min, 95 °C for 15 min, and 45 cycles of (94 °C 40 s, 60 °C 40 s, 72 °C 40 s) and 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified Cav1.2 was detected by SYBR green.Cav1.2 Sanger sequencingThe RT-qPCR product was purified with a High Pure PCR product Purification kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR products of one of the pig lung tissues together with primers (the same as used for the RT-qPCR) were sent for Sanger sequencing at LGC Biosearch Technologies (Berlin, Germany). The resulting sequences were imported into the program CLC Main Workbench version 22.0 (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and trimmed manually. The forward and reverse reads were assembled and the consensus sequence was checked for identity to publically available sequences using the tool BLAST against NCBI Genbank. The sequence was uploaded to NCBI Genbank with the accession number OQ973297.In situ hybridizationThe consensus sequences were used to create probes for the in situ hybridization to investigate the Cav1.2 mRNA expression in porcine lung tissues (N = 1). The probe sequences correspond to nucleotides 3532–3625 (between exon 27-exon 28) on the sus scrofa calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 C/Cav1.2 (CACNA1C) predicted coding nucleotide sequence Genbank ID XM_021092981.1 and were ordered from by Eurofins Genomics (Germany GmbH). The sequences were as follows; sense, 5′ GCT GGA CAA GAA CCA GCG GCA GTG ‘3 and antisense, 5′ CAC TGC CGC TGG TTC TTG TCC AGC 3′. The probes were labeled with CY3 fluorophore on both ends and HPLC purified. The in situ hybridization was performed using Shandon racks as earlier described with minor modifications32. The sections were pretreated with 10% Proteinase K diluted in TBS (124568, Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) for 10 min at 37 °C and flushed two times with Mili-Q water after deparaffinization. To investigate the amount of autofluorescent signal in the porcine tissues the method described above was performed but without adding the probes. The images of the porcine lung tissues were obtained with an LSM 900 microscope with an Airyscan2 detector attached and a 40x/1.2 objective. All images were acquired, processed, and analyzed with the ZEN software by using the same settings for the CY3 channel on all images. The images were analyzed in ImageJ in the same manner as described for CavPan α1 IHC but by using the “split channels” function, selecting the surface of lamina epithelialis, and setting a threshold of 181 for DAPI and 6; 158 for the Cav1.2 probes.ResultsVDDCs and Cav1.2 are expressed on the surface of the porcine respiratory epitheliumThe HEK 293 T cells and the porcine lung tissues tested positive for Cav1.2 when tested by RT-qPCR. The consensus sequence (OQ973297) of the porcine lung tissue corresponds to nucleotides 3532-3625 on sus scrofa calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 C/Cav1.2 (CACNA1C) predicted coding nucleotide sequence (Genbank ID XM_021092981.1). The porcine consensus sequence had the highest sequence similarity with the human Cav1.2 (97% identity) followed by the guinea pig and the ferret Cav1.2 sequences (96 % and 95% identity, respectively, Supplementary file S1).All of the selected species showed 100% homology in the Cav1.2 amino acid sequence targeted by the CavPan α1 antibody (Supplementary file 2). The immunohistochemical staining for CavPan α1 and the negative absorption control is shown in Fig. 1. The absorption control showed no staining in the murine brain and porcine heart, nasal and tracheal tissues, and only weak irregular staining was found in the bronchial epithelium. Furthermore, the application of the isotype IgG-antibody control in murine brain tissue and porcine heart, nose, trachea, and lung tissues is shown in Fig. S1. Although the isotype control was negative in the murine brain tissue, unspecific staining was observed in the porcine heart, nose, bronchi, and bronchioles, but it was significantly lower than the staining intensity of CavPan α1. The CavPan α1 staining of the murine brain showed strong staining in the molecular, granular, and Purkinje cell layers of the cerebellum and in neurons (Fig. 1). Furthermore, there was a moderate to strong positive staining of CavPan α1 throughout the porcine heart tissue with the highest staining intensity of the Purkinje fibers. In the porcine respiratory tissues, the strongest staining was observed in the epithelial layer and the glands in the submucosal layer. Furthermore, there was also a weaker positive staining of the smooth muscle cells surrounding the bronchi and bronchioles. The % CavPan α1 area in lamina epithelialis of the different porcine respiratory tissues and lung compartments is presented in Fig. 2. Briefly, the highest % CavPan α1 area was observed in the nose and bronchi followed by the alveoli and the bronchioles, which also showed a higher variation of staining. The lowest expression of CavPan α1 was observed in the trachea.Fig. 1: α1 subunits of Cav1 and Cav2 families (CavPan α1) of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels are expressed in the murine brain, porcine heart, nasal, tracheal, and lung tissues.The presence of CavPan α1 (brown staining) in murine brain, porcine heart, nasal, tracheal, and lung tissues was visualized immunohistochemically by CavPan α1-antibodies. A negative control was performed by a homologous absorption test on parallel sections of the murine brain together with the porcine heart and respiratory tissues.Full size imageFig. 2: The lowest expression of α1 subunits of Cav1 and Cav2 families (CavPan α1) is found in the porcine trachea.The median percentage of CavPan α1 staining in the epithelium (% area (normalized to hematoxylin)) in the porcine respiratory tissues and different lung compartments.Full size imageCav1.2 mRNA visualized by in situ hybridization is presented in Fig. 3. Positive staining on the surface of the terminal bronchioles epithelial cells was observed with the anti-sense probe, whereas the sense probe showed a weaker signal. The anti-sense and sense probes showed no to weak positive staining of the alveoli, and as no difference between the two probes was observed, this signal only was interpreted as a background signal. In general, an autofluorescent signal of the erythrocytes was observed but otherwise, no autofluorescent signal was found (Fig. S2).Fig. 3: The Cav1.2 L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels are expressed in the porcine terminal bronchioles.A The presence of Cav1.2 (red staining) in porcine lung tissues was visualized by in situ hybridization and a CY3 fluorophore-labeled anti-sense Cav1.2 probe. A negative control was performed using a sense probe.

White scale bar indicates 20 µm.Full size imageCells expressing CavPan α1 co-localize with cells positive for IAV in experimentally infected pigsParallel sections of immunohistochemical staining for IAV and CavPan α1 from two IAV-experimentally infected pigs (one with swine-adapted IAV and one with human-adapted IAV) are presented in Fig. 4. Co-localization of IAV-positive and CavPan α1-positive cells was present in the respiratory epithelium throughout the respiratory tract. Furthermore, the leukocytes present in the bronchial and bronchiolar exudate also stained positive for CavPan α1 but were only rarely positive for IAV.Fig. 4: Co-localization of influenza A virus (IAV) and α1 subunits of Cav1 and Cav2 families (CavPan α1).Parallel sections of IAV (red staining) and CavPan α1 (brown staining) in the respiratory tract of a pigs experimentally infected with an IAV circulating in pigs (N = 1, swine-adapted) and an IAV circulating in humans (N = 1, human-adapted).Full size imageDiscussionThe most interesting finding was that α1 subunits of Cav1 and Cav2 families (CavPan α1) are expressed in the respiratory epithelium throughout the porcine respiratory tract and co-localize with IAV-positive cells in experimentally IAV-infected pigs. The expression of Cav1.2 was observed in the porcine terminal bronchioles but not in the alveoli.The anti-CavPan α1 staining of the adult murine brain correlates to previous findings of non-fetal mice25,33, and the CavPan α1 in the porcine heart is in agreement with findings in cardiomyocytes of adult mice25. Both staining methods showed staining of the porcine lungs that correlate to the findings in fetal human and fetal/adult murine lung tissue18,24. Anti-CavPan α1 binds to both the Cav1 (Cav1.1–1.4) and Cav2 families (Cav2.1– 2.3) and showed staining of the smooth muscle cells surrounding the bronchi and bronchioles of the lungs, whereas the Cav1.2 antisense-probe specifically binds to Cav1.2 and showed no staining of the smooth muscle cells. This difference could be explained by Cav2.2 showing a stronger staining intensity of the smooth muscle cells compared to Cav1.2 in the fetal human lung, which only showed weak staining of the smooth muscle cells24.The IAV tropism in pigs are epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract, and occasionally in glands in the submucosal layer and alveolar macrophages5,34,35,36,37,38,39. The lowest expression of α1 subunits of Cav1 and Cav2 families (CavPan α1) was observed in the trachea, which correlates with a previous study that found a lower viral load in the trachea compared to porcine nose and lung tissues40. An explanation for a lower viral load in the trachea remains to be clarified since the pig IAV host receptor (SA-α2,6) is expressed in the trachea (5, 36, 38), however, one explanation could be a lower expression of α1 subunits of Cav1 and Cav2 families. Furthermore, a higher viral load is mainly found in the bronchiolar epithelium compared to the alveoli5,35,36,38, which correlates with the Cav1.2 mRNA expression. Thus, Cav1.2 specifically could be an important factor for IAV internalization in pigs. Further investigations of α1 subunits of Cav1 and Cav2 families and specifically Cav1.2 distribution in the adult human lung tissues are needed to elucidate if pigs and humans have different distribution patterns in the respiratory tissues. Additionally, we observed a high within-tissue variation of the expression of α1 subunits of Cav1 and Cav2 families and if this is explained by variance in the IHC staining or due to other factors such as the presence of neutrophils expressing cav2.3 and/or IAV-induced necrosis of the epithelial cells, remain unknown41.The results of the present study strongly suggest that the pig is a suitable model to investigate VDCC inhibitors’ effect on the treatment of IAV in porcine cell lines. Additionally, optimized RT-qPCR or situ hybridization methods are needed to quantify the expression of Cav1.2 throughout the porcine respiratory tract and to evaluate if Cav1.2 is up- or down-regulated during an IAV infection. Squamous metaplasia is often induced after IAV-infections in humans and squamous metaplasia has been shown to decrease the expression of Cav1.2 in the nasopharynx of humans, suggesting that Cav1.2 is less expressed in humans with recent IAV infections42,43.The co-localization of IAV and VDCCs might be translatable to humans since the pathogenesis of IAV infection in pigs resemble human, pigs show clinical signs similar to humans44, and humans also express Cav1.2 in their fetal respiratory tract. Additionally, an L-type VDCC inhibitor prevents the internalization and spread of SARS-Cov-2, thus it could be speculated that Cav1.2 is important for other respiratory viruses as well45.

Flu vaccination among West Virginians has been lower in recent years since the pandemic, with only 30.7% of the population estimated to be vaccinated as of November 2023. “Flu vaccination prevents tens of thousands of flu-associated hospitalizations and deaths each year,” said Dr. Matthew Christiansen, State Health Officer and Commissioner of DHHR’s Bureau for Public Health. “By receiving your flu vaccine this season, you also protect people around you, especially those who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness.”Standard flu vaccines are approved and recommended for most children ages 6 months or older. Flu vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines may be given at the same time. To learn more about flu vaccines, visit www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm.To locate a health care facility or pharmacy with flu vaccines, please visit vaccinefinder.org. National Influenza Vaccination Week is an observance lasting from December 4 through December 8, 2023.

While influenza illness is known to be particularly dangerous for frail and elderly patients, the relationship between influenza illness and outcomes in patients with cancer remains largely unknown. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried to identify patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosed between 2009 and 2015. Influenza-like illness (ILI) activity, provided by the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network of the Center of Disease for Control and Prevention, was merged with the SEER dataset on the state-month level. Regional monthly mortality rates were compared during low versus high flu months in this ecological cohort study. 202,485 patients with NSCLC from 13 SEER-reporting states were included in the analysis. 53 of 1049 state-months (5.1%) had high flu activity. Monthly mortality rates during low and high flu months were 0.041 (95% CI 0.041–0.042) and 0.051 (95% CI 0.050–0.053), respectively (RR 1.24 [95% CI 1.21–1.27]). The association between ILI activity and mortality was observed at the individual state level and in all clinical and regional subgroups. Increased regional influenza activity is associated with higher mortality rates for patients with NSCLC. Vaccine-directed initiatives and increased awareness amongst providers will be necessary to address the growing but potentially preventable burden of influenza-related lung cancer deaths in the U.S. Similar content being viewed by others Active surveillance for adverse events of influenza vaccine safety in elderly cancer patients using self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistic analysis Article Open access 16 August 2023 Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on female breast, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer incidence, stage and healthcare pathway to diagnosis during 2020 in Wales, UK, using a national cancer clinical record system Article 02 May 2022 Socioeconomic disparities in immunotherapy use among advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients: analysis of the National Cancer Database Article Open access 20 May 2023 IntroductionEach year, influenza affects approximately 15% of the U.S. population, leading to more than 334,000 hospitalizations and 41,000 deaths, with $26.7 billion direct and indirect associated costs1. Though influenza is known to be particularly devastating for frail and elderly patients2, 3, data to support vulnerability in patients with cancer is much less robust. Patients with cancer are often immunocompromised due to treatment with chemotherapy or their underlying disease and, therefore, more susceptible to microbial infections. Patients with cancer are assumed to be at high risk of influenza-related morbidity and mortality4, but the majority of data pertaining to influenza-related outcomes is derived from older and smaller retrospective case series5,6,7,8,9,10,11.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) and the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommend annual influenza vaccination for all individuals, including those with cancer or those receiving chemotherapy4, 12. However, it is recognized that there is a lack of level 1 and retrospective evidence to support this recommendation12, 13. Influenza vaccination rates remain low amongst patients with cancer and their family members in the U.S. and worldwide, largely due to an absence of recommendations by individual treating providers1, 14,15,16. Reasons for the lack of provider initiative include a lack of awareness of the seriousness of influenza infection in patients with cancer and a lack of professional guidelines or awareness of professional guidelines17,18,19. Therefore, a better understanding of the impact of influenza on the outcomes of patients with cancer would allow researchers and physicians to better access risks of exposure and the potential benefits of vaccination. This may have the effect of increasing vaccination rates, both by increasing awareness amongst treating physicians and by bolstering the strength of evidence behind recommendations from professional societies. The burden of influenza-related morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer is expected to rise, consequent to an aging population and an increase in cancer prevalence20. It is, therefore, important to address this growing and potentially preventable problem.In this ecological study, we explore the relationship between regional influenza activity and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mortality rates across several flu seasons in the United States. We hypothesized that patients with lung cancer would be susceptible to influenza-related mortality, given that both disease processes have pulmonary tropism. We used population-level data on influenza-like illness (ILI) provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mortality provided by the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Combining these two datasets, we were able to achieve spatiotemporal resolution at the state-month level.MethodsData sourcesThe SEER Program is the NCI’s authoritative source for population-based cancer incidence and survival in the U.S.21. It is also considered the gold standard for cancer data collection internationally22. Data is populated from national cancer registries in 13 contributing states and encompasses approximately 34.6% of the U.S. population23,24,25. Mortality data reported to SEER is provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. The SEER Program is updated annually for follow-up on vital status and routinely undergoes quality-control checks. Data were collected and analyzed as previously reported26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34.FluView Interactive is a dashboard produced by the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at the CDC35. The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) consists of more than 3500 providers in 50 states who report more than 47 million patient visits per year.This study was exempt from review by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board.Sample selection and codingThe SEER database was queried (November, 2017 submission, including data from 1973 to 2015)36 to identify all cases of NSCLC37 within the lung and bronchus, diagnosed between October 1, 2008 and December 31, 2015. AJCC 6th Edition Staging was the most modern staging system that was uniformly available for all patients38, 39. Percent of persons below the poverty level, median household income, normalized cost of living index, and rural urban continuum are recorded at the county level in which the individual patient resides. Cases diagnosed at autopsy or that could have 0 days of follow-up, cases with prior malignancies, and cases with unknown AJCC Staging were excluded40.ILI activity level is provided at the state level for each week of the year. Weekly ILI activity levels were averaged during each month. The CDC and SEER datasets were then merged at the state-month level.Primary measurements and outcomesILI is defined as a fever (temperature of 100 °F [37.8 °C] or greater) and a cough and/or sore throat without a known cause other than influenza. ILI activity is calculated based on the regional percentage of patient visits for ILI reported during each week. Activity levels compare the mean reported percent of ILI visits for a given week with the mean reported percent of visits during non-influenza weeks. ILI activity levels range from 1 to 10, with an activity level of 1 corresponding to values below the mean, 2 corresponding to values within one standard deviation of the mean, and each level above 2 corresponding to an additional standard deviations above the mean. Activity levels of 8–10 are considered high (hereafter referred to as high flu months). Overall mortality rate was defined as the number of patients with NSCLC who died of any cause within a given month, divided by the total number of patients at risk of death. One-month mortality rate was defined as the number of patients who were newly diagnosed with NSCLC and died of any cause within a given calendar month, divided by the total number of patients who were newly diagnosed and at risk of death during that same month.Statistical analysisIn this ecological study, bootstrapping41 was used to determine the distributions of both overall and one-month mortality rates. For each state and month, a sample was drawn—with replacement—from the raw mortality data, with the number of samples equal to the number of cases in the state in that month. A sample mortality rate was then calculated using the data across all months and states, for both low and high flu groups. This process was then repeated 10,000 times in order to determine the distribution of mortality rate. The 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the mortality rates were determined by taking the middle 95% of the sampled mortality rates. To calculate the relative risk (RR) and its 95% CI, the sampled mortality rates for the high flu group was divided by the sampled mortality rate of the low flu group. In addition, the 95% CI of the low flu group was determined by dividing the mortality rate from 10,000 samples of the high flu group by an additional 10,000 samples of mortality rate from the low flu group. All statistical analyses were conducted using Python Version 3.5.5 (Python Software Foundation, Delaware, United States) and the NumPy module42.ResultsPatient selection and characteristicsOur initial query identified 282,795 patients with a diagnosis of NSCLC (Supplemental Fig. 1). After applying our exclusion criteria, there were 202,485 cases remaining. Median follow-up and survival times were 8 and 11 months, respectively, with 141,651 deaths. Pneumonia and influenza was listed as the cause of death in 0.4% (n = 592) of all death certificates (Supplemental Table 1). Demographical and clinical features of patients are displayed in Table 1. The majority of patients lived in metropolitan areas (85.5%) with greater than 1,000,000 people (57.2%). California and Georgia accounted for the largest proportion of patients (33.4 and 12.7%, respectively), while fewer patient records were collected from Alaska (274 [0.1%]), Utah (2373 [1.2%]), Hawaii (3113 [1.5%]), and New Mexico (3487 [1.7%]).Table 1 Patient demographical and clinical characteristics.Full size tableDistribution of high flu months1041 state-months were observed from the 13 SEER-reporting states, 53 (5.1%) of which were considered high flu months. The distribution of high flu months throughout the study period is illustrated in Fig. 1. 2009 contained the highest proportion of high flu months (24/52), followed by 2013 (8/52). High activity flu months generally occurred between October and February. Louisiana had the highest proportion of high flu months (18.8%), followed by Georgia (12.0%, Table 2).Figure 1Distribution of high flu months over the study period. Y-axis corresponds to the total number of states with high ILI activity during a given month and year.Full size imageTable 2 Distribution of high flu months by state.Full size tableInfluenza activity and mortality rateThe overall monthly mortality rate for all patients was 0.042 deaths per person at risk. The Supplemental Video shows a time-lapsed map of the United States with ILI activity and mortality rates for each SEER-reporting state. During low and high flu months, the monthly mortality rates were 0.041 (95% CI 0.041–0.042) and 0.051 (95% CI 0.050–0.053), respectively (RR 1.24 [95% CI 1.21–1.27], Fig. 2). To account for regional differences in patient characteristics and mortality rates43, we examined the relationship between influenza activity and NSCLC mortality at the individual state level (Fig. 3). In 9 out of 13 states, there was a statistically significant association between influenza activity and mortality rate, versus 1 state (Connecticut) in which the mortality rate during high flu months was significantly lower. In the states with the largest populations (California and Georgia), the RR for mortality during high versus low flu months were 1.54 (95% CI 1.44–1.64) and 1.24 (95% CI 1.18–1.30), respectively.Figure 2Overall monthly mortality rates during low and high flu months.Full size imageFigure 3Risk ratio for overall mortality rate during high flu months (A, B).

Error bars represent 95% confidence interval.Full size imageWe further examined the relationship between influenza activity and mortality in subgroups based on clinical and regional factors (Fig. 4). In all clinical subgroups, there was a significantly higher mortality rate during high flu months (Fig. 4A), with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Natives, for which there were exceptionally few cases available (0.5% of total population). There was also a significantly higher mortality rate in all regional subgroups (Fig. 4B). The RR for mortality during high versus low flu months increased incrementally based on the percentage of persons below the poverty line. The RR for mortality was 1.17 (95% CI 1.11–1.24), 1.22 (95% CI 1.15–1.28), 1.24 (95% CI 1.18–1.30), and 1.24 (95% CI 1.19–1.29) for Quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.Figure 4Risk ratio for overall mortality rate during high flu months in subgroups stratified by individual patient (A) and regional (B) clinical and demographical features. Dotted line intersects x-axis at one. Error bars represent 95% confidence interval.Full size imageSensitivity analysisThe majority of high flu month occurred during winter months (Fig. 1). To rule out that the association between influenza activity and mortality was due to a general increase in mortality during winter months, and not specific to influenza, we analyzed the relationship between influenza activity and mortality in winter and non-winter months separately. During winter and non-winter months, the RRs for mortality during high versus low flu months were 1.07 (95% CI 1.03–1.10) and 1.61 (95% CI 1.54–1.67), respectively (Supplemental Fig. 2).To minimize the influence of time on the outcome of interest, we performed a sensitivity analysis for the secondary outcome of one-month mortality. The 1-month mortality rates during low and high flu months were 0.094 (95% CI 0.093–0.095) and 0.102 (95% CI 0.096–0.109) deaths per persons diagnosed, respectively, with an RR of 1.08 (95% CI 1.03–1.13) during high flu months (Supplemental Fig. 3). We further examined the relationship between influenza activity and one-month mortality during winter and non-winter months (Supplemental Fig. 4), at the state level, and after stratifying by clinical and regional subgroups, as described previously (Supplemental Fig. 5). Qualitatively, our main findings were not substantially changed. However, there was no longer an incremental increase in the RR of mortality during high flu months as the percentage of persons below the poverty line increased.Ethical statementThis study was exempt from review by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board.Conference presentationA preliminary version of this study was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting 2019 (May 31–June 4, 2019, Chicago, Illinois) as an abstract.DiscussionIn this ecological study, we found that regional NSCLC mortality rates in the United States were higher during months with high ILI activity. This relationship was observed at the individual state-level and in all clinical and regional subgroups. We found an incremental increase in the relative risk of mortality with increasing percentages of patients below the poverty line. This may be due to lower vaccination rates in lower income communities1, 15, 44.Previous research has found negligible fluctuations in seasonal mortality rates for patients with lung cancer or other malignancies45, 46. Although influenza seasons generally occur between November and March, our ability to detect differences in mortality rates during high and low flu months is likely due to the spatiotemporal resolution of our study at the state-month level.Several older, smaller retrospective case series have suggested that influenza frequency and morbidity is higher in patients with cancer, though the majority of these studies have focused on hematological malignancies5, 6. There are fewer studies that report influenza-related outcomes in patients with solid malignancies and data suggests that outcomes are better for patients with solid cancers7, 8. To our knowledge, there is only one population-based study that examines influenza-related cancer outcomes7. Using data from the National Inpatient Sample, Cooksley et al. found that patients with cancer who were hospitalized for influenza-related illness have a longer length of stay, higher cost of hospitalization, and higher mortality rate than that of the general population. The mortality rate for hospitalized cancer patients was 9%. Several other studies, including one large multicenter retrospective and one large prospective study, have reported similar mortality rates in hospitalized cancer patients9,10,11. Among patients with cancer, the mortality rate was highest for those with lung cancer, reaching 12.4%. The study concluded that patients with cancer that were hospitalized with influenza-related infections are 10 times more likely to die than the general population.By assuming that all excess deaths that occurred during high flu months were due to influenza infection, we can approximate that 1.2% of deaths in our cohort were attributable to influenza infections. By comparison, pneumonia and influenza was listed as the cause of death in 0.4% of patients in our cohort, based on death certificate records. This discrepancy is expected, as it is known that influenza-related deaths, based solely on death certificate records, is a gross underestimation of the seasonal influenza’s true impact47, 48.Two studies, one retrospective and one prospective, have shown reduced influenza and pneumonia diagnoses, chemotherapy interruptions, and mortality in patients with solid malignancies who are vaccinated9, 15. A Cochran Systematic Review concluded that the benefits outweigh the potential risks when vaccinating adults with cancer against influenza13. Additionally, two studies have demonstrated cost-effectiveness of vaccination in patients with cancer based on analytical modeling49, 50. A U.S. study concluded that influenza vaccination is cost-effective for working-age cancer patients with a life expectancy greater than 2.8 months50. Given that the median survival times for all stages and stage IV patients with NSCLC are 11 and 4 months, respectively51, it appears that vaccination would be a cost-effective strategy in any working-age patient with NSCLC.Despite recommendations from professional societies to vaccinate patients with cancer annually, vaccination rates remain low in the U.S. and around the world9, 14,15,16, 52. In the U.S., only 40% of elderly patients with colorectal cancer received influenza vaccination15. Several studies have shown that the main reason for absence of vaccination in patients with cancer is a lack of incitation by the treating physician16, 18. Virtually every study that examined vaccination rates in patients with cancer concluded that increased awareness amongst practitioners was necessary to improve vaccination rates14, 16, 18, 19, 52.Advantages of the methodology used in this study include the use of large datasets with a population-based approach, representing 34.6% of U.S. patients with cancer. Additionally, it is the first study to assess regional influenza activity and lung cancer mortality over several influenza seasons. The CDC and the SEER program are the two most robust surveillance systems in the U.S. for influenza outbreaks and cancer mortality statistics, respectively. SEER is considered the international gold-standard for population research when measuring cancer incidence and mortality. Mortality is recorded from death certificates, which are linked to individual patient records via their social security numbers. Therefore, our primary outcome should be highly reliable.LimitationsA greater proportion of high flu months occurred during 2009, corresponding to the H1N1 pandemic. Because patients at risk of death during the 2009 pandemic would have shorter follow-up times, they may have had higher mortality rates, irrespective of influenza activity. To account for this, we also analyzed the one-month mortality rates.Although the ILI activity metric is based on an expansive surveillance system, it is known that less than half of patients with influenza symptoms present to their providers. Furthermore, ILI activity is based on presenting symptoms, not laboratory-confirmed influenza, which is the gold-standard for diagnosis. Some ILI visits may have been caused by other respiratory viruses53.Variations in the effect of ILI by state were estimated based on a limited number of observations and should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, differences in ecological conditions, such as patient populations, local policies, access to care, outbreak dynamics, and other confounders may affect the outcome.ConclusionsRegional ILI activity is associated with higher mortality rates for NSCLC patients in the U.S. This is the first population-based study to estimate the effects of regional influenza activity on mortality rates in patients with lung cancer over multiple flu seasons. Limitations notwithstanding, our study addresses the sparsity of data on influenza-related outcomes in patients with cancer. These findings may be used to: (1) Bolster evidence supporting professional guidelines for annual influenza vaccination in patients with cancer, (2) Estimate influenza-related mortality in patients with lung cancer in the U.S., (3) Project mortality in upcoming flu seasons based on predicted influenza activity, (4) Estimate cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in patients with lung cancer. Influenza is a major source of cancer-associated morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Vaccine-directed initiatives and increased awareness amongst providers will be necessary to address the growing but potentially preventable burden of influenza-related cancer deaths.

The last swine flu pandemic killed 457 people in Britain alone. A leading testing expert says this strain looks to be very different but is urging Brits to take precautions. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has revealed a British person has contracted a new strain of so-called ‘swine flu’ – influenza A (H1N2)v. It’s the first detection of this strain of flu ever found in a human in the UK, although it is similar to flu viruses currently circulating in British pigs. The concern is that the patient is not known to have worked with pigs. The UKHSA says: “As is usual early in emerging infection events, UKHSA is working closely with partners to determine the characteristics of the pathogen and assess the risk to human health.” Dr Avinash Hari Narayanan (MBChB), Clinical Lead at London Medical Laboratory, says: ‘It’s known this specific strain of swine flu can be passed from ill pigs to humans, but it would be rare for the H1N2 strain to be passed from human to human without initial exposure to pigs. The fact that the patient, who lives in North Yorkshire, has no known contact with infected animals is leading to a wider investigation. ‘Influenza A (H1N2)v is very different to the influenza A H1N1/09 strain of swine flu that killed 457 people in the UK back in 2009/10. Even so, close contacts of the patient are being followed up by UKHSA and partner organizations. The UKHSA says: “The source of their infection has not yet been ascertained and remains under investigation.” ‘For this reason, we recommend people who become unwell consider being tested, particularly if they have had direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments. ‘In humans, the symptoms of swine flu to look out for include: a high temperature a cough a runny nose body aches chills sneezing ‘However, these symptoms are very similar to seasonal flu and also some strains of Covid-19 and to RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), the latter producing cold-like symptoms but generally not a high temperature. ‘Other symptoms of swine flu may include: Related StoriesNew CDC report highlights disparities in flu hospitalization and vaccinationExclusive: Emails reveal how health departments struggle to track human cases of bird fluLink between COVID-19 and long-term risk of autoimmune and autoinflammatory connective tissue disorders loss of appetite vomiting diarrhoea ‘Pregnant women are considerably more likely to develop serious complications from swine flu. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that up to 10% of all hospitalized patients with swine flu are women who are more than three months pregnant. ‘The early identification of this British case underlines how vital routine testing for flu and Covid remains. The individual was tested by their GP after experiencing respiratory symptoms and the virus was identified as part of routine national flu surveillance undertaken by UKHSA and the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP). The UKHSA used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a method of testing. ‘With health services under strain this winter, it is not always easy to access a flu test. However, it may be important for people to identify exactly which virus they are suffering from. Private tests are available, such as London Medical Laboratory’s pioneering 4-in-1 Covid, RSV, influenza A and B test. This is particularly useful for people who wish to differentiate whether they are suffering from a strain of flu or Covid-19. It’s still the recommendation of the NHS that people should try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if they, or their child, have symptoms of Covid. ‘Remember, the current strains of flu that are circulating may produce only mild illness in one person but may cause severe symptoms and even prove fatal to others. This is particularly important in people with pre-existing health conditions and long-term diseases. Similarly, while the RSV virus may only produce chesty cold symptoms in some people, it can severely affect elderly people and children. ‘All of these viruses, including swine flu, display very similar initial symptoms to the common cold, but these symptoms may quickly escalate. For this reason alone, many people will want the peace of mind a test result can bring, ensuring they are not endangering anyone in their family this festive season. ‘The revolutionary Covid, RSV and flu A and B, 4-in-1 PCR Test can be taken at one of over 95 selected pharmacies, drop-in clinics and health stores nationwide or, for convenience, at home through the post.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, another parallel pandemic emerged in birds worldwide: avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu. Poultry farmers, governments and international organizations are participating in a global campaign to control the virus. These efforts are informed by over 50 years of research from an unexpected place: St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Robert Webster, PhD, St. Jude Department of Infectious Diseases emeritus member on the beach during an avian influenza sample collection trip. Robert Webster, PhD, St. Jude Department of Infectious Diseases emeritus member, may be the single most influential avian influenza researcher in the world. His work identifying wild waterfowl as the natural reservoir for bird flu and the virus’s ability to directly infect humans set the stage for modern anti-avian flu infrastructure. This includes initiating and maintaining surveillance efforts while advancing understanding of the fundamentals of the virus. He began this journey at St. Jude. “People asked, ‘Why are you studying influenza at St. Jude?’” Webster said. “Immunosuppression, leading to infections such as influenza, mumps, measles and the common cold, was the real threat to our kids at the time.” When Webster joined, cure rates for pediatric cancers were improving drastically. One of the elements that improved upon those successful treatments was countering the infectious disease threats to patients, such as the flu, which were poorly understood. One of the first steps to doing so was finding where the flu comes from. In 1975, St. Jude was designated a World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Influenza, quite an honor considering there were only six such centers in the world at that time. The center at St. Jude was unique in being designated the only center on the exchange of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface. One of the first to find the flu in fowl When Webster was a young scientist, influenza was something of a mystery. The annual flu season remained unexplained — it appeared every year, but no one understood where it came from. Webster, a New Zealander (or “Kiwi”) by birth, frequently went back and forth between the U.S. and Australia, where he earned his PhD. One day, happenstance led him onto the track that would define his career. Webster and colleagues identified wild ducks are the main source of avian influenza virus. Artwork by Malcolm Houston. “Graeme Laver and I walked on a beach north of Bateman’s Bay on the coast of New South Wales one morning and found it covered with dead mutton birds,” Webster remembered. “That year, South Africa had a big bird die-off of terns [seabirds related to gulls], and they’d isolated an influenza virus. We offhandedly suggested it may be flu in Australia too.” While originally suggested as an absurdity, Webster and Laver did make a formal application to investigate the cause of death in these birds. While there was some initial hesitation to fund him (and some questions on scientific versus recreational motivations to visit the Great Barrier Reef), eventually, the World Health Organization (WHO) funded the work. “The first year, we detected antibodies to that year’s circulating influenza virus in the mutton birds,” Webster said. “But we didn’t get any virus. So, we went back the next year and managed to isolate one or two influenza viruses.” He then went himself to sample birds in Canada and the United States, finding wild ducks as the main source of the virus. With the ease of finding the virus and antibodies in large amounts, it begs the question: why had no one realized avian influenza was coming from these birds? When a visiting Russian scientist found that the site of influenza virus replication in the duck was in the intestine, “It was one of those ‘eureka’ moments,” Webster explained. “The virus was not in the respiratory tract — we’d been looking in the wrong end of the bird for years.” Two St. Jude scientists watch birds flying away during an annual collection trip. In humans, influenza primarily infects the respiratory tract. Scientists had made the mistake of assuming that would be true for other species, but in birds, influenza infects the intestinal tract. Once the scientists started testing feces from the birds, they quickly found the virus. Avian influenza infects first known humans “We had quite a few quiet years after discovering where the virus was in ducks,” Webster said. “No serious outbreaks in humans or animals. The attitude was, ‘That’s not causing any problems, why bother about it?’” At the time, the birds remained healthy even when teeming with the virus. No one observed any transfer to humans. Scientific funding institutions were becoming more reluctant to sponsor this research. However, the infrastructure for finding and identifying the virus would become necessary in 1996. A child succumbed to an infection in Hong Kong, which was identified as influenza but did not correspond to a subtype known to infect humans. Few institutions had the resources to screen for other kinds of influenza, such as those in birds. After several failed identification attempts, researchers contacted the Webster lab, which had generated the appropriate materials (antibodies) to identify the virus in that quiet interim period. The antibodies could identify the proteins that influenza uses to enter and exit cells. First, the hemagglutinin (H) protein, the viral protein that it uses to find and attach to the correct cells. Second, the neuraminidase (N) protein, which allows the virus to spread from infected cells. There are 18 H subtypes and 11 N subtypes, with different combinations associated with various infections. For example, H1N1 is believed to infect mammals primarily. Anything H5 was thought to exclusively infect birds until scientists in the Netherlands used Webster’s antibodies to identify the virus that killed the child in Hong Kong. “When the test came back as H5, we thought initially that the folks in Hong Kong had contaminated the sample because we knew that they worked in the markets and it had never been seen before,” Webster said. “Eventually, we all accepted the fact that this child succumbed to H5N1.” “When Dr. Webster went to Hong Kong,” explained Richard Webby, PhD, St. Jude Department of Host-Microbe Interactions. “It was the first time anyone realized people could be directly infected with these bird viruses. It changed the world of virology.” “For many years, people always thought that a bird flu strain had to get into a pig and mix with another mammalian virus in order for it to gain the ability to infect people,” said Stacey Schultz-Cherry, PhD, St. Jude Department of Host-Microbe Interactions. “That appears to be true in most cases, but Dr. Webster’s work showed humans can get these viruses from birds directly.” Six months after the first patient, Hong Kong experienced an outbreak of avian influenza that directly infected more humans, with a significant mortality rate. Webster was quickly able to find birds, including wild ducks, in the live poultry market that contained massive quantities of the virus, coordinating efforts to contain and manage the epidemic. He was invited for several years to help advise managing outbreaks after this, in addition to performing his research. An excellent center for influenza research “At about that stage, I decided, it’s time to get this stuff funded,” Webster said. “So, I wrote a grant to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to really understand the flu. Why was it killing? What were the properties of these viruses? How did it develop into a killer strain?” St. Jude scientists collect avian fecal samples from a beach where potentially infected birds congregate, which will later be processed to find and identify any influenza virus present. Grant proposals to the NIH have never been easy. Many lab heads spend agonizingly long hours perfecting their grant applications, only to be disappointed with the decision. Webster’s experience was different. “I asked for a fairly modest amount of money,” Webster reminisced. “NIH came back and said, ‘No, what we want to do now is to give you even more money than you requested. Instead of three years, we’re going to give you five years.’ “That first grant was so tremendously successful that when the five years were up, NIH created the Center of Excellence with six centers for flu in the United States,” Webster said. “It grew out of St. Jude — we were responsible for these programs starting, and they’re still ongoing today.” St. Jude received its first distinguishment as one of these programs in 2007 from the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the NIH. Each Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR) is tasked with developing tools to control epidemic or pandemic influenza while finding ways to minimize the threat of an influenza pandemic, including those emerging from animal viruses. CEIRR’s ongoing work on human influenza shows promise for protecting and preventing infection. Since 1975, St. Jude has also been designated one of seven World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centers with the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) to participate in global surveillance and control of the virus, including animal sources of outbreaks. Webby and Schultz-Cherry serve as co-directors of CEIRR. They are quick to give credit to the mentor who preceded them and whose work laid the foundations for their own careers. “We’re following in the footprints and the traditions of Robert Webster,” Shultz-Cherry said. “We continue that legacy of infectious disease research.” “Dr. Webster’s projects are probably the longest-running flu surveillance programs in the world,” said Webby, who now oversees several of those projects. “We have partners around the world that we work with to collect samples in decades-long collaborations he established.” Ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres) a bird species known to harbor influenza. “Dr. Webster spent his career learning avian influenza ecology and researching flu pandemic potential,” said Charles Russell, PhD, St. Jude Department of Host-Microbe Interactions. “That field of research all goes back to him.” The ongoing legacy of St. Jude influenza research Webster is proud of what his protégés have done to move the influenza field forward. “They’re doing damn good work,” Webster emphatically stated. “When I read their papers, I’m impressed with what they’re doing, and they are doing things that we could never have imagined.” Multiple investigators at St. Jude, including Webby and Schultz-Cherry, continue advancing cutting-edge bird flu research. One such investigator is Russell, who also trained for a time under Webster. “Rob Webster was instrumental in getting me involved in the field,” Russell remembered. “I had a background in protein structure and function, and we collaborated on understanding influenza hemagglutinin (H) protein, funded by the original version of CEIRR.” Russell specializes in understanding how the stability of the H protein affects transmission and infection. One of his more recent studies found that the more stable the protein was, the more likely it could be transmitted between ferrets. This is because the upper respiratory tract of humans is mildly acidic, so more molecularly stable H proteins better resist premature activation from the acid. WHO and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) watch for mutations that make a virus more likely to jump from avian hosts to humans. Russell’s work indicates that adding H stability to that screening may improve pandemic potential risk predictions. This ties directly into what he learned from Webster. “Dr. Webster was the original flu surveillance guy,” Russell said. “His work led to the understanding that while we have the seasonal flu that spreads, there is an enormous amount of diversity. We also have these unknown flu viruses spreading in wild aquatic birds, which we need to understand better.” Tracking the avian flu today To learn more about flu’s spread in birds, Webby has continued much avian flu surveillance work and its downstream virological research. For example, every year, Webby lab members travel to Delaware Bay to collect bird flu samples. “Pulling viruses out from Delaware Bay for so long has given us insight into the transmission of viruses and what’s important, such as what type of host response can actually drive transmission,” Webby said. For decades, St. Jude virologists and their collaborators have collected thousands of samples annually to study and surveil avian influenza, to better understand the virus and protect against its crossover into humans. In addition to Delaware Bay, St. Jude works with international groups to collect samples around the globe. They’ve identified the ancestors of the current H5N1 strain killing birds in the Americas — and why it is spreading so fast. “The pandemic H5N1 is better adapted to wild birds than any other highly pathogenic viruses we’ve ever seen,” Webby explained. “That’s best reflected by the fact that prior to this outbreak, we had one spillover event from another hemisphere that led to short-lived epidemics. For this virus, we have tracked at least six spillovers, from a combination of Western Europe and East Asia to the West Coast [of North America].” The transmissibility appears to be helped by access to a different form of neuraminidase (N), which allows the virus to exit from cells to spread. At some time in North America, the virus mixed with existing flu viruses in wild birds to also produce a more virulent strain. “This virus is doing something these avian flu [strains] haven’t done in the past,” Webby said. “The virus is really neurotropic, both in the birds but also in also in the wild mammals. When we used our experimental ferret model, we found huge viral loads in the brain.” Influenza hosts influence risk While Webby looks into how the virus spreads in birds, Schultz-Cherry looks at mammalian hosts’ risks for and during influenza infection. “Most of my work is in South America, where I have several studies looking at influenza in humans,” Schultz-Cherry said. “We monitor birds, pigs and now marine mammals and pets in Chile, as well as the people in contact with them.” “We also see health disparities by studying these populations,” Schultz-Cherry said. “For example, the highly pathogenic H5N1 Dr. Webby is studying continues to spread westward and is really becoming an ecological disaster, particularly in South America.” People around the world may lack adequate access to refrigeration, which directly impacts influenza, according to Schultz-Cherry’s work. They must live in close proximity to pigs and chickens to have fresh meat available, which increases the risk of animal-to-human transition (zoonotic disease). In addition, these people are much less likely to be vaccinated. Schultz-Cherry, therefore, studies rural and indigenous people of Colombia, as well as people in close contact with animals, a more representative population of the majority of the world that lives outside of fully industrialized nations, to understand how to combat the flu better. “What we’re finding,” said Schultz-Cherry, “is that we’re going to need to take a different approach to making a vaccine that is good at protecting these high-risk populations than what we’ve conventionally implemented.” Her lab is currently observing influenza and immunology within these communities to find the best path forward for interventions, using knowledge generated by other St. Jude scientists, such as Russell’s insight into the H protein and Webby’s work identifying the potentially dangerous features of avian flu. “We’re all moving Dr. Webster’s research legacy forward in very different ways, which highlights the strength of the influenza program at St. Jude,” Schultz-Cherry concluded. Keeping up with the fight against the flu Webster may be partially retired, but he keeps abreast of current avian influenza threats. The ongoing H5N1 pandemic in domestic poultry and wild birds concerns him, especially after seeing the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. “COVID was bad enough,” Webster explained. “SARS-CoV-2 serves a very important purpose to show what a pandemic virus can do to the world’s economy. Right now, in South America, H5N1 is killing wild birds, seals and bears. That pathogenicity means it has the potential of being a big danger.” Webster may be one of the best people in the world to know what represents a global pandemic threat. He went to and from countries across the globe, including Russia, China and, in one case, Antarctica, throughout his career, consulting on the flu and virus outbreaks. In that time, he made St. Jude a well-known name for high-quality influenza research throughout the scientific community. “I have to admit that I’ve been very spoiled by St. Jude,” Webster said. “The facilities here are top-class, letting us lead the international influenza research community. That’s only possible through the full support of WHO, NIAID and St. Jude donors. I hope that support continues so my trainees can continue the fight against the flu.” Even as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic comes under control, the current H5N1 outbreak in birds shows that the influenza virus still looms large as a public health threat. St. Jude researchers, armed with continued support, will carry on the work of Webster, staying at the forefront of understanding and opposing avian influenza and its potential crossover to humans. St. Jude continues to be a Collaborating Center for WHO under the co-direction of Stacey Schultz-Cherry and Richard Webby.

Darnall Army Medical Center Army Public Health Nursing team, hospital staff and volunteers provided 285 Tricare eligible beneficiaries their flu shot during its annual Influenza vaccination event Dec. 2. The seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended every year for everyone 6 months of age and older with rare exception, according to the CDC. People at high risk for influenza complications include infants, young children, pregnant women, adults 65 and older, nursing home or long-term care facility residents, and those with underlying health conditions. “Getting the flu shot helps increase the overall protection in the community,” said Maj. Theresa Suggs, Army public health nursing chief, CRDAMC. “The more people we get vaccinated the less likely individuals are to spread the virus to other people, in addition to if they do attract the virus it’s less severe, which means they are less likely to visit the emergency room, make an appointment or even be hospitalized.” The event began in the early morning hours through 1 p.m., allowing beneficiaries time to get up and out to begin the weekend. “We actually appreciate this event,” said Linh Sengmany, spouse of Cpt. Eric Sengmany, 504 MI Bde. “It helps make it easier during the weekends, because my husband and I can bring our kids together.” It makes it a lot easier when you have kids it’s not easy making appointments, she added. Soldiers and hospital staff look forward and volunteer for events like this to serve the surrounding community. It helps the community to get to come out to events like this and actually get to see our faces,” said Sgt. Jose Andicoechea, combat medic. “It helps make that connection that we are here to help, because they hear about us, but don’t see us all the time, so sometimes they may forget that we are here for them.” If you missed the event don’t worry, eligible Tricare beneficiaries may also obtain a ﬂu shot at a TRICARE-authorized pharmacy or in a network urgent care clinic. Beneﬁciaries are encouraged to check the policies and procedures of their preferred pharmacy prior to obtaining the vaccine. Some pharmacies require a prescription for children under 7 years old and may not provide ﬂu shots to children under 4 years old.

Back to Healio Key takeaways: Fewer than 40% of eligible children at high risk for influenza complications received an antiviral. The AAP, Infectious Diseases Society of America and CDC recommend antiviral treatment for kids with influenza. Use of antivirals to treat influenza in children remains low despite their wide availability and guidelines recommending their use, according to a study published in Pediatrics. The FDA has approved four influenza antivirals, including oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, oral baloxavir and intravenous peramivir, although oseltamivir remains the only oral influenza antiviral that is FDA-approved for use in children aged 5 years or younger. Globally, one in 10 children acquire symptomatic influenza every year, according to study author James W. Antoon, MD, PhD, MPH, an assistant professor of pediatrics and hospital medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “We know that antiviral medications can shorten duration of symptoms and prevent some common complications of influenza, such as ear infections, pneumonia, and hospitalization,” Antoon told Healio. “Prior work has shown that that there’s some variability in how often adults are prescribed antiviral medication, and so we wanted to investigate how often are these antivirals used in children for treatment and in what populations are they being used more than others?” The AAP, CDC and Infectious Diseases Society of America all have strong recommendations supporting the use of antivirals in children who are at high risk for influenza complications, “meaning those that are less than 5 years of age and those with a certain underlying condition,” Antoon said. “They also have recommendations about when you should consider treatment, and for those who are not high risk,” Antoon continued. “We wanted to investigate using the database that we had. Where are those guidelines being followed?” Antoon and colleagues used Narrative MarketScan Commercial Claims, a large national pharmacy database that includes commercial insurance claims in all 50 states from 2010 to 2019, to find trends in dispensing of these antiviral medications. The entire analysis included 1,416,764 unique antiviral dispensations during that time period. Children with risk factors for influenza complications accounted for 63.3% of the antiviral dispensations. Despite widely endorsed national guidelines that suggest all children aged younger than 2 years receive an antiviral, only 37% of children in this age group in the study with an influenza diagnosis were dispensed an antiviral. Oseltamivir was the most frequently prescribed antiviral treatment at 99.8%. “Children [younger] than 2 years old should receive an antiviral, regardless of how long they’ve had symptoms,” Antoon said. “There was a large percentage of children who the guidelines say should be treated who are not being treated.” Last year’s influenza season was “one of the worst for children,” according to Antoon. “These antiviral medications have been very well studied. They are effective and they are extremely safe,” Antoon said. “Our findings from this study show that increasing appropriate antiviral use might be an easy target to improve outcomes for children who have influenza, that parents should be aware that these antivirals exist, and that they’re safe and effective.” According to the authors, care for children with influenza can be improved with judicious use of available antivirals, especially for children at high risk for influenza complications. “While these medications are safe and effective, the most powerful tool that we have to prevent poor influenza outcomes is vaccination,” Antoon said. “Vaccines both prevent influenza and lessen the severity of influenza when our child has it. So, while it’s great we have these medications [so that] after somebody gets the flu we could help them get better, the best thing we can do for children is to vaccinate them to prevent the flu in the first place.” The study was accompanied by a commentary authored by Pia S. Pannaraj, MD, MPH, a researcher in the division of infectious diseases within the department of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego, who wrote that there is an urgent need for better understanding of factors contributing to a lack of guideline adherence. “As life and human behavior have returned to prepandemic norms, influenza will circulate at higher rates in the community once again,” Pannaraj wrote. “Influenza vaccine effectiveness is known to vary greatly each season, and vaccination rates in children decreased during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.” References: Antoon JW, et al.

UnsubscribeWhat's the Difference Between Influenza and Stomach Flu? | Discover MagazineThe MagazineLoginRegisterStay CuriousSubscribeThe SciencesMindTechnologyHealthEnvironmentPlanet Earth/HealthWhat's the Difference Between Influenza and Stomach Flu?Although both are often referred to as "flu," they're actually totally different conditions. Learn the symptoms, causes, and treatment options for both.By Sofia QuagliaDec 8, 2023 7:00 PM(Credit:eldar nurkovic/Shutterstock) NewsletterSign up for our email newsletter for the latest science newsSign Up Since we call both influenza and the stomach flu by the term "flu," when speaking colloquially, it's easy to conflate the two — but influenza and the stomach flu are two different conditions. Aside from some overlap in the symptoms, they have different causes, prevention tools, symptoms, treatments, and tips and tricks.Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician, helps us unpack them.What Is Influenza?(Credit:fizkes/Shutterstock) Influenza, aka "the flu" or "seasonal flu," is a respiratory system infection affecting the nose, throat, windpipe, and lungs.The strains mutate and change yearly, so some years it may be a relatively mild flu season, while other years, "It's like a total whopper," says Johns.What Causes the Flu?The influenza virus — types A, B, C, and D — causes the flu. Type A is more common overall and can cause epidemics. It is also more common in adults, while Type B is more common in babies under the age of five.Read More: Does a Runny Nose Mean You Have COVID-19, the Flu, or a Common Cold?What Are the Symptoms of Influenza?If you have the flu, you might experience congestion and symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, coughing, sore throat, body and muscle aches, headaches, fever, chills, and fatigue. According to Johns, the hallmark of influenza, and how experts generally differentiate it from other infectious diseases, is that it tends to cause higher sustained fever. "I get up, I'm exhausted, my muscles hurt. And I have that sustained high fever and headache," she says. How Does the Flu Spread?The flu is an airborne virus that spreads through the teeny-tiny saliva droplets a person releases into the air when coughing, sneezing, talking, laughing, etc. Inhaling the contaminated air or coming in contact with the droplets that have landed on surfaces and then touching your nose and mouth can result in an infection."It's not as contagious as something like measles, but it is definitely in the 'very contagious' category," says Johns. Kids under the age of 5, adults over the age of 65, and immuno-compromised people like people with asthma or diabetes are most at risk of contracting the influenza virus.When Is Flu Season?Influenza is common and can be contracted at any time of the year. "There is always some level of circulating influenza, whatever the strain du jour is, right?" says Johns. It's not like there is no flu in August and 100 percent in December, Johns said. Yet, there is a "seasonality to it," says Johns — "flu season." This is the time of year during fall and winter when influenza is most common in the U.S. It usually starts in October and peaks between December and February, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data. Influenza viruses are cold-weather viruses — hardier in cold weather. They transmit easier in the winter because we spend more time inside and increase close contact.How Long Does the Flu Last?The first 48 to 72 hours of symptoms are when you're most sick and most contagious. After that, your viral load slowly decreases — symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, and feeling congested usually go away in up to a week — but many people still feel like they've been knocked off their feet for seven to 10 days. Read More: Why Are Viruses More Active In The Winter?How Severe Is Influenza?Most people who contract influenza will feel better after a few days without having to do anything special but rest and keep their symptoms in check. Yet, the flu can get serious and lead to sinus and ear infections or severe complications like pneumonia.What Makes You Most at Risk for Influenza?Heart conditionsChronic lung issuesImmunocompromisedBeing young (young children)Being Elderly According to Johns, if you fall under one of the following on the list, you could be at risk for potential organ damage and other complications from the flu. Read More: Why Do I Get Sick So Often, While Others Stay in Freakishly Good Health?How To Prevent the Flu(Credit:Melinda Nagy/Shutterstock) There are vaccines for the flu, and the CDC recommends getting one every year for people over the age of 6 months. You should get the shot as early in "flu season" as possible, like late October.How Effective Is the Flu Vaccine?The vaccine might not completely shield you from contracting the infection, but it has been proven to lower your chance of getting it, make symptoms and complications less severe, decrease your chances of ending up in the ICU, and lower the chances of spreading it around. Read More: Will COVID-19 Need an Annual Vaccine Like the Flu?How To Treat the FluMost of the time, the flu will just do its course and resolve on its own. To help alleviate flu symptoms, get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and take medications like paracetamol or ibuprofen to reduce fever and muscle pain. When Should I Be Taking Antivirals for the Flu?Antibiotics have no effect since a virus causes influenza, so that the doctor might prescribe antiviral medication like Tamiflu. You should start these medications within 48 to 72 hours of initial symptoms, or they don't have any added benefit. Still, they're "a mixed bag," according to Johns, and might not do the trick for everybody — so always speak to your healthcare provider about what they recommend.Read More: Coronavirus or the Flu: Is There a Difference Between Symptoms?What Is the Stomach Flu?(Credit:Halfpoint/Shutterstock) The stomach flu, known to science as gastroenteritis, is an infection of the gastrointestinal system — so your intestines and stomach. You might experience loss of appetite, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea.You might also experience general symptoms from your immune system responding to the infection, including fever, achiness, and fatigue. What Causes the Stomach Flu?Unlike influenza, the stomach flu is more of a general term to refer to the irritation and infection of the gastrointestinal tract, so there are multiple causes. Stomach flu can result from unclean food and water parasites and bacteria, such as E. coli, campylobacter, shigella, and Salmonella. Still, viruses cause almost half of all stomach flu. Viruses that cause the stomach flu include norovirus, rotavirus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus. Norovirus is the most common of these viruses, causing up to 21 million illnesses yearly. A doctor will likely diagnose you according to your symptoms and a physical check. Read More: How To Avoid Food-Borne IllnessHow Does Stomach Flu Spread?Stomach bugs spread in different ways. Consuming contaminated food or water that carries the illness or touching a contaminated surface results in infection. Or you may come in contact with an infected person — especially their vomit or stool, like by changing a diaper.Overall, though, the stomach flu is very contagious. That's why it's common for large groups of people in close contact to contract it. "They are all infectious diseases; whether or not some may be slightly more contagious than others, they're all contagious," says Johns.How Long Does Stomach Flu Last?Symptoms for the stomach flu usually show up within 48 hours after you've come in contact with the bacteria or virus. From then on, it mostly lasted one to three days and sometimes up to a week. Vomiting usually only lasts for the first 48 hours of the virus, but diarrhea might linger a little longer.Read More: Why We Feel So Terrible When We Get SickHow To Prevent Stomach FluUnlike influenza, there is no shot against the stomach flu, except for two vaccines against rotavirus for children and infants.Your best chance to avoid contracting this pesky infection is by keeping your hygiene to the max, always washing your hands for two entire Happy Birthdays, and staying away from anybody who might not be feeling great.How To Treat Stomach FluMost of the time, the stomach flu will just do its course and resolve on its own. In the meantime, get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and avoid food that could irritate your stomach. For others around you who might want to stay safe, tips are easy too: "No sharing drinks, carry out frequent hand washing and wipe down of surfaces," says Johns. "If you have the capability, let the sick person use one bathroom and one bathroom only."How to Avoid the Flu and Stomach FluWhether it's the flu or the stomach flu, the guidelines are always the same: try not to get it! "I always like to do the equation' prevention > treatment,'" says Johns, whether it's staying at home and missing out on some extra tiring activities or something as simple as wearing a mask when you're feeling iffy. "Don't be a jerk about it, right?" says Johns. "Do it. It is worth it to temporarily hunker down and do the things that we know work to prevent and help decrease the spread of some of this stuff."Read More: The Possibility Of "Flurona" And What Two Viruses Can Do At Oncevaccinesmedicinewellness1 free article leftWant More?

News Flash Public Health Posted on: December 4, 2023[ARCHIVED] National Influenza Vaccination Week Dec. 4-8 National Influenza Vaccination Week (NIVW) is an awareness campaign promoted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The annual observance in December reminds everyone 6 months and older that there is still time to protect yourself against severe illness this flu season. Vaccination is important for people at higher risk for severe illness, including pregnant people or young children. A flu vaccine is the only vaccine that protects against flu and has been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization, and death. This year, the CDC is using the phrase "wild to mild" to promote the benefits of the flu vaccine, specifically how the vaccine can significantly reduce the chances of severe illness in people who get sick with the flu. A traditional needle injection isn't the only way to protect yourself from the flu. You can also opt to receive the Flu Nasal Spray, which provides all the benefits of the traditional vaccination without the pain of a needle. The Lexington Health Department hosted several community vaccination clinics this year, offering this season's flu shot and the latest COVID-19 vaccination. The CDC encourages people to get both vaccines at the same time. You can find Flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine locations nearest you by using an interactive online map from the CDC. For information on upcoming and future vaccination clinics in Lexington, visit the Health Department's webpage.

After a successful transplant surgery, Maggie was on the road to recovery. TOPICS:NationwideChildren'sHospital BCInfluenza AMaggieLung transplantNationwide Children's HospitalRecoveryECMOVentilationIn December of last year, Maggie became very sick with influenza A. Though influenza can be common during the holiday season, Maggie’s case quickly became uncommon as the illness progressed. Causing significant damage to her lungs, Maggie entered respiratory failure and was treated with a host of available therapies to help her lungs recover, including multiple forms of ventilation and antibiotics. Unfortunately, none of the strategies doctors tried seemed to be working, and she continued to get worse.When it became clear to her doctors that Maggie’s lungs were not going to recover, they reached out to Nationwide Children's Hospital, one of the few places in the world that can offer life-saving lung transplantation to children.“Maggie was thought to be at very high risk of death without lifesaving lung transplantation,” said Dr. Stephen Kirkby, medical director of the lung transplant program at Nationwide Children's. “Her team reached out to us, and we were glad to be able to bring her to Nationwide Children's to be evaluated for a lung transplant.”Once at Nationwide Children's, Maggie’s future was still uncertain. She was entirely dependent on an ECMO machine, a way of oxygenating the blood and removing carbon dioxide, for many weeks, awaiting a donor match.Two months after arriving at Nationwide Children’s, Maggie received news that she would receive two new lungs. After a successful transplant surgery, Maggie was on the road to recovery. Although, that road was not an easy one.“Maggie was sick enough for months waiting for a transplant so we knew it was going to take a long time for her to regain strength and nutrition,” Dr. Kirkby recalled.After a long recovery process, taken at Maggie’s pace, she was finally ready to go home this summer.“When I first got home, there were a lot of obstacles I didn't know I'd have to experience,” Maggie remembered. “The lack of strength I had when I first got home was really difficult to work around. But now I can do everything I want to with only minimal help. I'm so grateful for the physical therapy and occupational therapy that I've taken. It's just helped me get back into life.”As for her organ donation, “It's the most selfless gift you could ever give anyone,” Maggie said. “You can save someone's life so they can live out their dreams, and that is truly amazing.”This holiday season, you can give to Light Up The Lawn, Light Up A Life, and help the patients at Nationwide Children’s Hospital live out their dreams. Every donation makes a difference, financially and visually, as the butterflies on Nationwide Children’s lawn are illuminated each time a contribution is made.

A QUESTION FOR ALL LISTENING WHO’VE YET TO GET THEIR YEARLY VACCINE FOR THE FLU. IS IT TOO LATE TO GET PROTECTION FOR THE SEASON? WELL, I ASKED DR. VANESSA WALKER, CHIEF MEDICAL EXECUTIVE WITH SUTTER ROSEVILLE, WHO SAYS IF YOU GOT THE SHOT TODAY, YOU’D BE PROTECTED IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS, JUST IN TIME FOR BOTH KWANZAA AND CHRISTMAS. THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET VACCINATED BEFORE WE ALL START TRAVELING FOR THE HOLIDAYS AND GOING AROUND THE COUNTRY, SEEING OUR LOVED ONES. THE FLU. A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION BECAUSE THE CDC IS CURRENTLY RANKING CALIFORNIA AS ONE OF TEN STATES ACROSS THE US WITH HIGH RATES OF INFLUENZA. RIGHT NOW, WE’RE DEFINITELY SEEING FLU, BUT WE’RE SEEING A LOT OF RSV. SO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU’RE A CANDIDATE FOR THE RSV VACCINE, THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER GOOD ONE, ESPECIALLY I’M REALLY PLUGGING FOR PREGNANT WOMEN. IF YOU’RE ELIGIBLE, GET THE VACCINE BECAUSE IT’S THE BABIES THAT ARE TOO YOUNG TO GET VACCINATED ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE. SO WE REALLY WANT TO PROTECT OUR LITTLE GUYS. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTING A 12.2% RSV POSITIVITY RATE ACROSS THE STATE. RSV HIGHER CURRENTLY THAN THE FLU, WHICH SITS AT 7.4%. MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS SAYING THE VACCINES THIS YEAR ARE WELL MATCHED AGAINST THE VIRUSES. AND AT THIS POINT IN THE COLD AND FLU SEASON IN CALIFORNIA IS STILL REPORTING LESS THAN A SINGLE PERCENTAGE IN HOSPITALIZATION RATES RELATED TO THE FLU. BUT WE DID SEE IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE WAS A LOT OF INFLUENZA A, SO THAT’S WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING. AND WE ARE ALSO EXPECTING THAT THIS VACCINE IS A PRETTY GOOD MATCH. IF WE GET VACCINATED, IF WE DO A GOOD JOB AND IT REALLY PENETRATES THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY, THEN WE CAN SET OURSELVES UP TO HAVE, YOU KNOW, A DECENT FLU SEASON WHERE LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED.

Advertisement The California Department of Public Health currently lists RSV at a 12.2% positivity rate in California, and the flu at 7.4%.“This is a great time to get vaccinated before we start traveling for the holidays going around the country and seeing our loved ones,” said Dr. Vanessa Walker, Chief Medical Executive at Sutter Roseville Medical Center.Dr. Walker explained it only takes about two weeks for protection to set in after receiving the flu vaccine.Medical professionals explain, that this year the vaccine is a great match for the viruses, specifically Influenza A, which is being seen most frequently among the public. “If we get vaccinated, if we do a good job, and it really penetrates throughout the community, then we can set ourselves up to have a decent flu season where lots of people are protected,” said Dr. Walker.

While influenza illness is known to be particularly dangerous for frail and elderly patients, the relationship between influenza illness and outcomes in patients with cancer remains largely unknown. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried to identify patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosed between 2009 and 2015. Influenza-like illness (ILI) activity, provided by the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network of the Center of Disease for Control and Prevention, was merged with the SEER dataset on the state-month level. Regional monthly mortality rates were compared during low versus high flu months in this ecological cohort study. 202,485 patients with NSCLC from 13 SEER-reporting states were included in the analysis. 53 of 1049 state-months (5.1%) had high flu activity. Monthly mortality rates during low and high flu months were 0.041 (95% CI 0.041–0.042) and 0.051 (95% CI 0.050–0.053), respectively (RR 1.24 [95% CI 1.21–1.27]). The association between ILI activity and mortality was observed at the individual state level and in all clinical and regional subgroups. Increased regional influenza activity is associated with higher mortality rates for patients with NSCLC. Vaccine-directed initiatives and increased awareness amongst providers will be necessary to address the growing but potentially preventable burden of influenza-related lung cancer deaths in the U.S. Similar content being viewed by others Active surveillance for adverse events of influenza vaccine safety in elderly cancer patients using self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistic analysis Article Open access 16 August 2023 Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on female breast, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer incidence, stage and healthcare pathway to diagnosis during 2020 in Wales, UK, using a national cancer clinical record system Article 02 May 2022 Socioeconomic disparities in immunotherapy use among advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients: analysis of the National Cancer Database Article Open access 20 May 2023 IntroductionEach year, influenza affects approximately 15% of the U.S. population, leading to more than 334,000 hospitalizations and 41,000 deaths, with $26.7 billion direct and indirect associated costs1. Though influenza is known to be particularly devastating for frail and elderly patients2, 3, data to support vulnerability in patients with cancer is much less robust. Patients with cancer are often immunocompromised due to treatment with chemotherapy or their underlying disease and, therefore, more susceptible to microbial infections. Patients with cancer are assumed to be at high risk of influenza-related morbidity and mortality4, but the majority of data pertaining to influenza-related outcomes is derived from older and smaller retrospective case series5,6,7,8,9,10,11.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) and the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommend annual influenza vaccination for all individuals, including those with cancer or those receiving chemotherapy4, 12. However, it is recognized that there is a lack of level 1 and retrospective evidence to support this recommendation12, 13. Influenza vaccination rates remain low amongst patients with cancer and their family members in the U.S. and worldwide, largely due to an absence of recommendations by individual treating providers1, 14,15,16. Reasons for the lack of provider initiative include a lack of awareness of the seriousness of influenza infection in patients with cancer and a lack of professional guidelines or awareness of professional guidelines17,18,19. Therefore, a better understanding of the impact of influenza on the outcomes of patients with cancer would allow researchers and physicians to better access risks of exposure and the potential benefits of vaccination. This may have the effect of increasing vaccination rates, both by increasing awareness amongst treating physicians and by bolstering the strength of evidence behind recommendations from professional societies. The burden of influenza-related morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer is expected to rise, consequent to an aging population and an increase in cancer prevalence20. It is, therefore, important to address this growing and potentially preventable problem.In this ecological study, we explore the relationship between regional influenza activity and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mortality rates across several flu seasons in the United States. We hypothesized that patients with lung cancer would be susceptible to influenza-related mortality, given that both disease processes have pulmonary tropism. We used population-level data on influenza-like illness (ILI) provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mortality provided by the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Combining these two datasets, we were able to achieve spatiotemporal resolution at the state-month level.MethodsData sourcesThe SEER Program is the NCI’s authoritative source for population-based cancer incidence and survival in the U.S.21. It is also considered the gold standard for cancer data collection internationally22. Data is populated from national cancer registries in 13 contributing states and encompasses approximately 34.6% of the U.S. population23,24,25. Mortality data reported to SEER is provided by the National Center for Health Statistics. The SEER Program is updated annually for follow-up on vital status and routinely undergoes quality-control checks. Data were collected and analyzed as previously reported26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34.FluView Interactive is a dashboard produced by the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at the CDC35. The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) consists of more than 3500 providers in 50 states who report more than 47 million patient visits per year.This study was exempt from review by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board.Sample selection and codingThe SEER database was queried (November, 2017 submission, including data from 1973 to 2015)36 to identify all cases of NSCLC37 within the lung and bronchus, diagnosed between October 1, 2008 and December 31, 2015. AJCC 6th Edition Staging was the most modern staging system that was uniformly available for all patients38, 39. Percent of persons below the poverty level, median household income, normalized cost of living index, and rural urban continuum are recorded at the county level in which the individual patient resides. Cases diagnosed at autopsy or that could have 0 days of follow-up, cases with prior malignancies, and cases with unknown AJCC Staging were excluded40.ILI activity level is provided at the state level for each week of the year. Weekly ILI activity levels were averaged during each month. The CDC and SEER datasets were then merged at the state-month level.Primary measurements and outcomesILI is defined as a fever (temperature of 100 °F [37.8 °C] or greater) and a cough and/or sore throat without a known cause other than influenza. ILI activity is calculated based on the regional percentage of patient visits for ILI reported during each week. Activity levels compare the mean reported percent of ILI visits for a given week with the mean reported percent of visits during non-influenza weeks. ILI activity levels range from 1 to 10, with an activity level of 1 corresponding to values below the mean, 2 corresponding to values within one standard deviation of the mean, and each level above 2 corresponding to an additional standard deviations above the mean. Activity levels of 8–10 are considered high (hereafter referred to as high flu months). Overall mortality rate was defined as the number of patients with NSCLC who died of any cause within a given month, divided by the total number of patients at risk of death. One-month mortality rate was defined as the number of patients who were newly diagnosed with NSCLC and died of any cause within a given calendar month, divided by the total number of patients who were newly diagnosed and at risk of death during that same month.Statistical analysisIn this ecological study, bootstrapping41 was used to determine the distributions of both overall and one-month mortality rates. For each state and month, a sample was drawn—with replacement—from the raw mortality data, with the number of samples equal to the number of cases in the state in that month. A sample mortality rate was then calculated using the data across all months and states, for both low and high flu groups. This process was then repeated 10,000 times in order to determine the distribution of mortality rate. The 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the mortality rates were determined by taking the middle 95% of the sampled mortality rates. To calculate the relative risk (RR) and its 95% CI, the sampled mortality rates for the high flu group was divided by the sampled mortality rate of the low flu group. In addition, the 95% CI of the low flu group was determined by dividing the mortality rate from 10,000 samples of the high flu group by an additional 10,000 samples of mortality rate from the low flu group. All statistical analyses were conducted using Python Version 3.5.5 (Python Software Foundation, Delaware, United States) and the NumPy module42.ResultsPatient selection and characteristicsOur initial query identified 282,795 patients with a diagnosis of NSCLC (Supplemental Fig. 1). After applying our exclusion criteria, there were 202,485 cases remaining. Median follow-up and survival times were 8 and 11 months, respectively, with 141,651 deaths. Pneumonia and influenza was listed as the cause of death in 0.4% (n = 592) of all death certificates (Supplemental Table 1). Demographical and clinical features of patients are displayed in Table 1. The majority of patients lived in metropolitan areas (85.5%) with greater than 1,000,000 people (57.2%). California and Georgia accounted for the largest proportion of patients (33.4 and 12.7%, respectively), while fewer patient records were collected from Alaska (274 [0.1%]), Utah (2373 [1.2%]), Hawaii (3113 [1.5%]), and New Mexico (3487 [1.7%]).Table 1 Patient demographical and clinical characteristics.Full size tableDistribution of high flu months1041 state-months were observed from the 13 SEER-reporting states, 53 (5.1%) of which were considered high flu months. The distribution of high flu months throughout the study period is illustrated in Fig. 1. 2009 contained the highest proportion of high flu months (24/52), followed by 2013 (8/52). High activity flu months generally occurred between October and February. Louisiana had the highest proportion of high flu months (18.8%), followed by Georgia (12.0%, Table 2).Figure 1Distribution of high flu months over the study period. Y-axis corresponds to the total number of states with high ILI activity during a given month and year.Full size imageTable 2 Distribution of high flu months by state.Full size tableInfluenza activity and mortality rateThe overall monthly mortality rate for all patients was 0.042 deaths per person at risk. The Supplemental Video shows a time-lapsed map of the United States with ILI activity and mortality rates for each SEER-reporting state. During low and high flu months, the monthly mortality rates were 0.041 (95% CI 0.041–0.042) and 0.051 (95% CI 0.050–0.053), respectively (RR 1.24 [95% CI 1.21–1.27], Fig. 2). To account for regional differences in patient characteristics and mortality rates43, we examined the relationship between influenza activity and NSCLC mortality at the individual state level (Fig. 3). In 9 out of 13 states, there was a statistically significant association between influenza activity and mortality rate, versus 1 state (Connecticut) in which the mortality rate during high flu months was significantly lower. In the states with the largest populations (California and Georgia), the RR for mortality during high versus low flu months were 1.54 (95% CI 1.44–1.64) and 1.24 (95% CI 1.18–1.30), respectively.Figure 2Overall monthly mortality rates during low and high flu months.Full size imageFigure 3Risk ratio for overall mortality rate during high flu months (A, B).

In all clinical subgroups, there was a significantly higher mortality rate during high flu months (Fig. 4A), with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Natives, for which there were exceptionally few cases available (0.5% of total population). There was also a significantly higher mortality rate in all regional subgroups (Fig. 4B). The RR for mortality during high versus low flu months increased incrementally based on the percentage of persons below the poverty line. The RR for mortality was 1.17 (95% CI 1.11–1.24), 1.22 (95% CI 1.15–1.28), 1.24 (95% CI 1.18–1.30), and 1.24 (95% CI 1.19–1.29) for Quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.Figure 4Risk ratio for overall mortality rate during high flu months in subgroups stratified by individual patient (A) and regional (B) clinical and demographical features. Dotted line intersects x-axis at one. Error bars represent 95% confidence interval.Full size imageSensitivity analysisThe majority of high flu month occurred during winter months (Fig. 1). To rule out that the association between influenza activity and mortality was due to a general increase in mortality during winter months, and not specific to influenza, we analyzed the relationship between influenza activity and mortality in winter and non-winter months separately. During winter and non-winter months, the RRs for mortality during high versus low flu months were 1.07 (95% CI 1.03–1.10) and 1.61 (95% CI 1.54–1.67), respectively (Supplemental Fig. 2).To minimize the influence of time on the outcome of interest, we performed a sensitivity analysis for the secondary outcome of one-month mortality. The 1-month mortality rates during low and high flu months were 0.094 (95% CI 0.093–0.095) and 0.102 (95% CI 0.096–0.109) deaths per persons diagnosed, respectively, with an RR of 1.08 (95% CI 1.03–1.13) during high flu months (Supplemental Fig. 3). We further examined the relationship between influenza activity and one-month mortality during winter and non-winter months (Supplemental Fig. 4), at the state level, and after stratifying by clinical and regional subgroups, as described previously (Supplemental Fig. 5). Qualitatively, our main findings were not substantially changed. However, there was no longer an incremental increase in the RR of mortality during high flu months as the percentage of persons below the poverty line increased.Ethical statementThis study was exempt from review by the Columbia University Institutional Review Board.Conference presentationA preliminary version of this study was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting 2019 (May 31–June 4, 2019, Chicago, Illinois) as an abstract.DiscussionIn this ecological study, we found that regional NSCLC mortality rates in the United States were higher during months with high ILI activity. This relationship was observed at the individual state-level and in all clinical and regional subgroups. We found an incremental increase in the relative risk of mortality with increasing percentages of patients below the poverty line. This may be due to lower vaccination rates in lower income communities1, 15, 44.Previous research has found negligible fluctuations in seasonal mortality rates for patients with lung cancer or other malignancies45, 46. Although influenza seasons generally occur between November and March, our ability to detect differences in mortality rates during high and low flu months is likely due to the spatiotemporal resolution of our study at the state-month level.Several older, smaller retrospective case series have suggested that influenza frequency and morbidity is higher in patients with cancer, though the majority of these studies have focused on hematological malignancies5, 6. There are fewer studies that report influenza-related outcomes in patients with solid malignancies and data suggests that outcomes are better for patients with solid cancers7, 8. To our knowledge, there is only one population-based study that examines influenza-related cancer outcomes7. Using data from the National Inpatient Sample, Cooksley et al. found that patients with cancer who were hospitalized for influenza-related illness have a longer length of stay, higher cost of hospitalization, and higher mortality rate than that of the general population. The mortality rate for hospitalized cancer patients was 9%. Several other studies, including one large multicenter retrospective and one large prospective study, have reported similar mortality rates in hospitalized cancer patients9,10,11. Among patients with cancer, the mortality rate was highest for those with lung cancer, reaching 12.4%. The study concluded that patients with cancer that were hospitalized with influenza-related infections are 10 times more likely to die than the general population.By assuming that all excess deaths that occurred during high flu months were due to influenza infection, we can approximate that 1.2% of deaths in our cohort were attributable to influenza infections. By comparison, pneumonia and influenza was listed as the cause of death in 0.4% of patients in our cohort, based on death certificate records. This discrepancy is expected, as it is known that influenza-related deaths, based solely on death certificate records, is a gross underestimation of the seasonal influenza’s true impact47, 48.Two studies, one retrospective and one prospective, have shown reduced influenza and pneumonia diagnoses, chemotherapy interruptions, and mortality in patients with solid malignancies who are vaccinated9, 15. A Cochran Systematic Review concluded that the benefits outweigh the potential risks when vaccinating adults with cancer against influenza13. Additionally, two studies have demonstrated cost-effectiveness of vaccination in patients with cancer based on analytical modeling49, 50. A U.S. study concluded that influenza vaccination is cost-effective for working-age cancer patients with a life expectancy greater than 2.8 months50. Given that the median survival times for all stages and stage IV patients with NSCLC are 11 and 4 months, respectively51, it appears that vaccination would be a cost-effective strategy in any working-age patient with NSCLC.Despite recommendations from professional societies to vaccinate patients with cancer annually, vaccination rates remain low in the U.S. and around the world9, 14,15,16, 52. In the U.S., only 40% of elderly patients with colorectal cancer received influenza vaccination15. Several studies have shown that the main reason for absence of vaccination in patients with cancer is a lack of incitation by the treating physician16, 18. Virtually every study that examined vaccination rates in patients with cancer concluded that increased awareness amongst practitioners was necessary to improve vaccination rates14, 16, 18, 19, 52.Advantages of the methodology used in this study include the use of large datasets with a population-based approach, representing 34.6% of U.S. patients with cancer. Additionally, it is the first study to assess regional influenza activity and lung cancer mortality over several influenza seasons. The CDC and the SEER program are the two most robust surveillance systems in the U.S. for influenza outbreaks and cancer mortality statistics, respectively. SEER is considered the international gold-standard for population research when measuring cancer incidence and mortality. Mortality is recorded from death certificates, which are linked to individual patient records via their social security numbers. Therefore, our primary outcome should be highly reliable.LimitationsA greater proportion of high flu months occurred during 2009, corresponding to the H1N1 pandemic. Because patients at risk of death during the 2009 pandemic would have shorter follow-up times, they may have had higher mortality rates, irrespective of influenza activity. To account for this, we also analyzed the one-month mortality rates.Although the ILI activity metric is based on an expansive surveillance system, it is known that less than half of patients with influenza symptoms present to their providers. Furthermore, ILI activity is based on presenting symptoms, not laboratory-confirmed influenza, which is the gold-standard for diagnosis. Some ILI visits may have been caused by other respiratory viruses53.Variations in the effect of ILI by state were estimated based on a limited number of observations and should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, differences in ecological conditions, such as patient populations, local policies, access to care, outbreak dynamics, and other confounders may affect the outcome.ConclusionsRegional ILI activity is associated with higher mortality rates for NSCLC patients in the U.S. This is the first population-based study to estimate the effects of regional influenza activity on mortality rates in patients with lung cancer over multiple flu seasons. Limitations notwithstanding, our study addresses the sparsity of data on influenza-related outcomes in patients with cancer. These findings may be used to: (1) Bolster evidence supporting professional guidelines for annual influenza vaccination in patients with cancer, (2) Estimate influenza-related mortality in patients with lung cancer in the U.S., (3) Project mortality in upcoming flu seasons based on predicted influenza activity, (4) Estimate cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in patients with lung cancer. Influenza is a major source of cancer-associated morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Vaccine-directed initiatives and increased awareness amongst providers will be necessary to address the growing but potentially preventable burden of influenza-related cancer deaths.

U.S. Maps Influenza Pneumonia China pneumonia outbreak CDC Flu and Pneumonia Map Shows US States With Highest Death Rates Published Dec 05, 2023 at 7:16 AM EST Updated Dec 05, 2023 at 9:48 AM EST CLOSE X By Aleks Phillips U.S. News ReporterFOLLOW Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Mississippi, Alabama, Hawaii and Tennessee are among the states with the highest average death rates due to cases of influenza and pneumonia, according to recent historical trends in data produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Between 2017 and 2021, all four states had mortality rates due to the virus and the lung inflammation it can cause above 18 in 100,000 people—with Mississippi having an annual average of 23.36 deaths per 100,000 in the state across the five-year period. Mississippi is also the state with the highest poverty rate in America, which has been linked to higher mortality.In contrast, just eight U.S. states had an average rate of 10 per 100,000 or less.There is heightened concern about pneumonia caused by seasonal respiratory illnesses such as influenza amid an outbreak of pediatric pneumonia cases in one county in Ohio and a reported increase in Massachusetts. There have been eight pediatric deaths associated with influenza this season, according to the CDC, though it is unclear how many were due to pneumonia.Average Influenza, Pneumonia Deaths Per 100K Warren County Health District in southwestern Ohio said last week that, as of Thursday, there were 145 cases of child pneumonia in the region—though it stressed that while the number of cases was elevated, the severity of illness was similar to previous years. Those who had recovered were found to have been infected with known bacteria and adenoviruses, which can cause a cold.It comes as there are concerns about an outbreak in cases of pneumonia among children in northern China. A lack of information shared by health officials in the country with the international community fueled fears that another novel virus was behind the trend, though Chinese officials have attributed the clusters of cases to already understood diseases and an easing of lockdown measures.Health officials in Warren County said that there was "zero evidence of this outbreak being connected to other outbreaks, either statewide, nationally or internationally." The cases of pneumonia were not thought to be caused by a new or novel respiratory virus.To produce the map, Newsweek took CDC data for the latest five recorded years and took an average of those annual rates for each state, meaning large year-to-year swings in mortality rates may push a state's overall average up or down.

However, the CDC cautions that although the data is adjusted for differences in age distribution, "rankings by state do not take into account other state specific population characteristics that may affect the level of mortality."The figures represent recent historical trends in mortality and are not necessarily indicative of current influenza and pneumonia mortality rates. A dataset for 2022 has yet to be released.Aside from those with mortality rates due to influenza and pneumonia higher than 18 per 100,000, West Virginia has an average rate of 17.98 per 100,000; Arkansas a rate of 17.44; and New York a rate of 17.04. Kentucky had a mortality rate of 16.44 per 100,000 over the five-year period.Many states' average death rates sat between 10 and 15 per 100,000 people, while Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, Montana, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state were the only states to have rates of 10 per 100,000 or less.

Experts aren’t so sure By Helen Branswell Dec. 5, 2023 Reprints Molly Ferguson for STAT Here are two things that are true. The world needs more effective flu vaccines. And pharmaceutical companies that learned of the vaccine-making power of the messenger RNA platform during the Covid-19 pandemic need new markets for their technology.advertisement With the heydays of Covid vaccine sales in the rearview mirror, the flu vaccine market, with its antiquated production process that mainly relies on growing viruses in hen’s eggs, seems an obvious candidate for a shake-up. The manufacturers have noticed, with Pfizer, Moderna, GSK, and Sanofi all working on mRNA flu shots. GSK and Sanofi are already major producers of flu vaccines and may be looking to solidify their positions; Pfizer and Moderna are new to flu, but further along in the mRNA work. Given the widespread acceptance that the current flu vaccines could use improvement, are mRNA shots the answer? As the scientific world waits for published data on which to formulate conclusions, STAT spoke to influenza and vaccine experts who see some significant benefits of applying mRNA technology to the production of flu vaccine — but also some serious challenges mRNA manufacturers will face breaking into this already crowded market. Let’s explore the arguments for and against mRNA flu shots.advertisement Advantage: Flu shots might not miss the mark as often The major challenge with flu vaccines is that to make them involves predicting the future. Flu viruses change constantly. As a result, experts meet twice a year at the World Health Organization to pore over global data, looking at which strains of the viruses — H1N1, H3N2, and two types of influenza B — seem to be picking up speed and which appear to be losing ground. In late February they choose the four they think will be the biggest threat in the following Northern Hemisphere season; in late September, they do the same for the next Southern Hemisphere winter. (This number will soon shrink to three; the WHO has urged manufacturers to remove the influenza B/Yamagata component from flu vaccines because those viruses no longer seem to be circulating.) Newsletters Sign up for The Readout Your morning rundown of the science, politics, and money driving biotech today Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy The choices — educated guesses, really — must be made far in advance because it takes manufacturers nearly half a year to produce the vaccine, bottle and label it, and distribute doses to doctors offices, workplace clinics, and pharmacies. Some years the selected strains protect well against what is making the rounds. Other years, they don’t. Vaccine production using the mRNA platform is quicker; for one thing, it doesn’t involve growing viruses. So vaccine strains could be selected closer to the actual season, potentially reducing the likelihood of mismatches. We saw this advantage in action when the Food and Drug Administration selected the Covid strain targeted in this fall’s shot. It was chosen in mid-June; the vaccine rollout began in mid-September. Flu vaccine might take longer to make, because the vaccine targets multiple viruses. Still, Raffael Nachbagauer, head of Moderna’s flu vaccine program, said he wouldn’t rule out the possibility that flu vaccine could be made on that timeline. An alternative might be a rolling strain selection process. “Maybe you don’t need to decide on all three strains in June, for example. Maybe you feel quite certain in April about the B strain, because the B strain hasn’t been changing as much,” he said. Choosing vaccine strains closer to flu season would be a huge advantage, said Florian Krammer, an influenza virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “If you can pick your strains after you know what’s mainly circulating in the Southern Hemisphere [winter], I think you’d have a much bigger chance to have a matched vaccine.” Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, said the mRNA platform might help improve the flu shot in another way. In the current egg-based manufacturing process, which most producers use, viruses can acquire deleterious mutations as they are grown in eggs. The process, known as egg adaptation, can effectively knock the vaccines off target. They train our immune systems to protect against viruses that may have important differences from the ones making people sick, creating a mismatch. This wouldn’t be an issue for mRNA flu vaccines, which do not contain killed viruses. Advantage: A foundation for quick vaccines in the next flu pandemic The biggest advantage of producing mRNA flu shots doesn’t relate to seasonal vaccine supplies, however. Where this technology would really shine would be in the event of a flu pandemic. When a flu pandemic starts, vaccine manufacturing operations pivot to making vaccines to target the new influenza strain. But the current global output isn’t adequate to make the doses we’d need in a flu pandemic. “Our capacity for responding to a [flu] pandemic using egg-based or even cell-based vaccines is … about a billion doses a year,” said Barney Graham, an immunologist and virologist who teaches at Morehouse University School of Medicine, and one of the key figures involved in the design of Covid-19 vaccines. “That’s not enough for 7 billion people on Earth. So mRNA could help solve that supply problem.” Even with the production capacity that exists, trying to grow a new virus in eggs can be a slower-than-optimal process, as was seen in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. By the time enough doses were available to vaccinate in the United States, the big wave of infections here was well past its peak. Most of the world made it through the H1N1 pandemic without the help of vaccines. CIDRAP Comprehensive Influenza Vaccine Initiative report Hyacinth Empinado/STAT The 2009 pandemic was mild by historic standards. But in the event of a more severe pandemic, every day that could be shaved off the vaccine production timeline would save lives. To take maximum advantage of that speed, however, we would have to have already licensed seasonal mRNA flu shots. That’s because of a quirk of flu vaccine regulation that is used to manage the need to constantly update the strains that flu shots target. The FDA and other major regulatory agencies do not require manufacturers to conduct large vaccine efficacy trials every time a component of the flu vaccine is updated; they do not consider the updated vaccine a new product. The “strain change” rule applies in a pandemic as well, meaning that once the vaccine is made, it doesn’t have to undergo the large-scale efficacy trials that Covid shots did in 2020. Small trials would be needed to show that the vaccine was safe and to determine the effective dose, but after that, the vaccine could be deployed. The wait for mRNA flu vaccines in a pandemic could be months shorter than what we experienced in 2020. Related: Flu activity gaining steam in the U.S. as vaccination rates lag But pandemics are rare and unpredictable events. The last four occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009. And while government pandemic planners count on seasonal flu production capacity to respond to pandemics, manufacturers rely on seasonal flu vaccine sales to stay in the market. “Manufacturing advantages aren’t necessarily market advantages most years,” noted Kathleen Neuzil, director of the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. Challenge: The mRNA baggage Some people continue to get Covid shots whenever they are recommended by health authorities. But public acceptance of Covid boosters has declined with each successive campaign. Only 16% of adults — and 32% of adults aged 65 and older — have received this fall’s shot so far, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Flu shot uptake this year is about double that. Covid fatigue is definitely playing a role. But some of the poor uptake is due to a stubborn distrust of the mRNA technology within a portion of the population. “I think there are data to support the fact that there is a certain segment of the population that is extremely reluctant to get an mRNA vaccine,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which earlier this year published a roadmap for development of better influenza vaccines. Even the best vaccine is only effective if it’s accepted by the people you hope to protect, he said. “If you don’t get it, you’ve got a [vaccine] effectiveness of zero.” Challenge: The side effect profile When mRNA Covid vaccines became available in the winter and spring of 2021, people started swapping side effect stories. Some felt nothing, or reported at most a bit of a sore arm. Some spiked high fevers, experienced chills, aches, malaise — symptoms that approximate the experience of having the flu — for a day or two. Some get knocked flat every time they get an mRNA shot. “I don’t react,” said Arnold Monto, an influenza epidemiologist at University of Michigan School of Public Health. “My daughter … knows she can’t be doing any normal activities for about 48 hours.” Traditional flu shots are not associated with the side effects that mRNA shots have become known for. That reputation for reactogenicity, as the the likelihood of unpleasant side effects is called, will probably turn some people off of the idea of mRNA flu shots, said Ben Cowling, chair of epidemiology at Hong Kong University’s School of Public Health. “With the reactogenicity profile, with the likely cost, I’m not sure what the uptake would be.” Challenge: Cost Traditional flu shots are cheap, especially compared to some of the new entrants in the overall vaccines market. Take GSK’s and Pfizer’s new RSV vaccines for seniors. They cost $280 and $295, respectively, if paid for by the private sector. Makers of mRNA vaccines won’t be able to charge those kinds of premiums for flu shots. “We have many options,” said Neuzil. “So any new influenza vaccine has to have a competitive advantage.” Regular flu shots cost between about $15 and $30, depending on whether the purchaser is the federal government or a private insurance plan. A few vaccines — two made by Sanofi, one by Seqirus — are sold at premium prices, around $75 a dose, because they have been shown to generate more protection in older adults. That enhanced protection earned them what’s known as a preferential recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an expert panel that helps the CDC form its vaccine guidance. If you’re 65 or older, you’ll get one of those vaccines. Experts watching the work on mRNA flu shots think it’s unlikely Pfizer and Moderna are looking to sell cheap mRNA flu shots. These are the companies, after all, that effectively quadrupled the prices of their Covid shots this fall when the vaccines were sold on the open market for the first time. Moderna now charges about $82 when it sells to government programs and $128 to the private sector; Pfizer’s prices have gone to $85 and $115 respectively, according to the CDC. But unless mRNA flu shots can earn a preferential recommendation from ACIP, it’s hard to see how companies could charge Covid-shot type prices — none of the flu vaccine manufacturers currently earns those — and still snag a share of an already crowded flu shot market. “Clearly if they are going to be coming with a vaccine at four times the cost, they’re going to have to at least show twice the benefit,” Monto said. To score a preferential recommendation, mRNA flu shot makers will have to prove that their vaccines are more effective than regular flu shots, and at least as effective as the enhanced shots now recommended for seniors. Related: FDA expert panel endorses idea of removing a component from flu vaccine In September, Moderna reported to shareholders that its mRNA flu shot induced higher levels of antibodies than Sanofi’s high-dose vaccine, Fluzone. Nachbagauer said Moderna hopes to have its mRNA flu vaccine licensed using that immunogenicity data, and would follow up with an effectiveness trial post-licensure. Pfizer is in the late stages of a Phase 3 trial and expects to have topline results soon. But it is testing its mRNA flu vaccine against a regular flu shot, not an enhanced vaccine. Influenza experts are keen to see published data from these trials. “There’s press releases from Moderna. There’s no data from Pfizer that’s publicly available. So we can only speculate. But it doesn’t look like what you get with the mRNA vaccines … is much better than what you get with regular seasonal flu vaccines,” said Krammer. Graham believes there could be additional benefits from the mRNA vaccines, because they draw a part of the immune system not activated by existing flu shots, CD8+ T cells, into the fight. That could help people who become infected to recover faster, in the process cutting back on the amount of flu spreading from person to person. “Shorter transmission, shorter viral loads for a shorter period of time. So it might have an effect on transmission. But I think that would have to be determined,” Graham said. Challenge: The market is already crowded The United States has what’s known as a universal recommendation for flu vaccination; the CDC says that everyone over the age of six months should get a flu shot every year. Though only about half of the country follows that advice, the recommendation has created a large market for flu vaccine. In recent years the combined U.S. purchases from both government and private buyers has been in the range of 170 million to 175 million doses, supplied by GSK, Sanofi, Seqirus, and AstraZeneca. (The latter sells only the needleless vaccine FluMist, which is puffed into a nostril.) Finding a niche in a crowded market isn’t going to be easy, said Norman Baylor, a former director of FDA’s office of vaccines who now runs Biologics Consulting. “I don’t see it at this time, unless they can demonstrate an advantage over what we already have,” he said. Advantage? Challenge? The jury is still out on combo vaccines Pfizer, Moderna, GSK, and Sanofi are all working on mRNA flu vaccines. While the latter two companies appear to be focused strictly on standalone flu shots, Pfizer and Moderna are both exploring the possibility of combining flu and Covid shots, and flu and RSV shots; Moderna is even working on an experimental vaccine that would protect against flu, Covid, and RSV. If those combination vaccines work, that could provide an entree to the market and premium prices. But a critical question hangs over these projects: Do RSV and Covid vaccines need to be given with the same frequency as flu shots? From a marketing point of view, the combination shots really only work if people need to be vaccinated against the viruses they target every year. “For influenza and Covid, the question to me that hasn’t been completely settled is, is Covid a seasonal virus that matches influenza?” Neuzil said. “I think we all hope it’s going to get there … [but] I’m not sure it’s entirely settled into that seasonal pattern yet.” And she noted that the rapidly waning immunity from Covid shots has led health authorities to allow older adults and people who are immunocompromised to get two Covid shots a year for the past two years. The ACIP has already said immunocompromised people can get a second Covid shot this winter and will study if people over 65 should too. If this twice-a-year Covid shot pattern for high-risk people holds, a combination shot could only be given in the autumn; a solo Covid booster would need to be given some months later. There are questions too about how often people will need to be revaccinated against RSV. Both GSK and Pfizer, which have brought RSV vaccines for older adults to market, have indicated their studies show that the protection lasts at least 18 months (Pfizer) and 24 months (GSK). (Their studies are ongoing; protection may last longer still.) If a vaccine isn’t needed annually, it wouldn’t make a good candidate for inclusion in an annual shot. “That’s premature,” Cowling said of the idea of combining RSV vaccine with flu shots. Challenge: The unfulfilled promise All involved in influenza research would love to see flu vaccines that would generate longer-lasting and broader protection, so that flu viruses wouldn’t be able to so easily evade the immunity vaccines induce. Or vaccines like one Hensley is working on, aimed at giving people some protection against 20 subtypes of flu that don’t currently circulate in people but may pose a pandemic threat in the future. The mRNA platform could be the right one for designing such vaccines, some experts believe. But that would involve more research and the creation of new vaccines that would need to prove to regulators that they can actually achieve things the existing products do not. That would be a longer path to the market than the approach manufacturers are currently taking, which is to produce a product similar to existing shots, just made in a different manner. Moderna is testing experimental flu vaccines that include another part of flu viruses, theorizing that inclusion of a protein called the neuraminidase could broaden protection; Krammer thinks this approach could help lessen the impact of vaccine mismatches. Nachbagauer said Moderna is mulling over what evidence might persuade regulatory agencies to license such a product. The company is also exploring adding an additional H3N2 virus to a seasonal vaccine, using the space that will be vacated by the removal of the B/Yamagata component. H3 viruses change more rapidly than the others and are more likely to be mismatched in the vaccine. The work, at this point, is to establish proof of concept, Nachbagauer said. “It’s essentially a conversation starter on ‘Is this possible?’ and then ‘How do you go from there?’” Krammer, for one, thinks using the mRNA platform to produce only status-quo flu vaccines would be almost tragic. “I think the mRNA platform has so much flexibility and it would be really shortsighted to just push for something that’s equivalent to what we have right now, instead of pushing for something that’s better.” Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to Sanofi as Sanofi Pasteur.

Follow-up care is also possible through the treatment process."If something comes up and [patients] want to have a follow up, they can return for a second telemedicine visit," said Andrew Weitz, Ph.D., NIH lead for the Home Test to Treat program."We actually haven't seen this happen at all yet," he added.MORE: About 36M American adults have received the updated COVID vaccine: CDCIn this Dec. 14, 2020, file photo, Lenox Hill Hospital Chair of Emergency Medicine Yves Duroseau receives the COVID-19 vaccine from Doctor Michelle Chester at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, in New Hyde Park, N.Y.Scott Heins/Getty Images, FILEThose not currently positive for COVID or flu can have free tests delivered if they are uninsured or insured through select federal programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, the VA health care system, or Indian Health Services."I think that these [telehealth] delivery mechanisms are going to be absolutely crucial to unburden the in-person offices and the lines that we have and wait times," said Dr. Michael Mina, chief science officer at eMed, the company that helped implement the new Home Test to Treat program.COVID tests can also be ordered through a separate program, covidtests.gov, which relaunched a few months ago allowing orders for an additional four tests per household, or eight tests for those who haven’t already placed an order yet this fall.As the largest source of funding for medical research in the world, the NIH is also pursuing its research-oriented mission to explore how technology can be leveraged to improve health care access more broadly."We're doing this to both benefit public health, but at the same time, being the NIH, which is really a research organization, one of our aims through this program is to better understand how technologies like at-home tests and telemedicine can improve health care access for people across the country," Weitz said.The program is set to expire in the spring of 2024, but it remains to be seen if the initiative will potentially transfer to the private sector."Whether or not a program like this could get enough interest from the public to be sustained by the commercial sector or is this something that needs sustained government investment... those are the types of research questions that we're looking to answer from this program," Weitz said.The program will initially provide the Pfizer COVID-19 & Flu Home Test, the first FDA-authorized test that can detect both viruses in one swab at home.MORE: What's the latest to know about COVID, flu vaccines as respiratory virus season begins?STOCK PHOTO/Getty ImagesTreatment for respiratory illnesses must typically begin within a short window of onset of symptoms or as soon as possible."By the time most people get to the doctor for [respiratory illnesses], they're already outside of the therapeutic window where treatment could have helped and so then they're kind of stuck, hoping that the body is going to clear the virus but some end up in the hospital," Mina said.Medication from the program delivered to the home will be available at no cost regardless of insurance status. If picked up from a pharmacy, patients may be asked to pay out of pocket or provide their insurance, but can ask the pharmacy if they have government procured treatments available at no cost."For acute respiratory viruses like COVID and influenza, really starting treatment as soon as possible after infection will help you to limit the growth that the virus will make in the first place and therefore help to limit the damage that it does to the cells of the body," Mina said.Related TopicsCoronavirusPopular ReadsTrump's plan for education in his second termNov 11, 4:56 PMSotomayor has no plans to resign: SourcesNov 10, 4:27 PMArrest in fatal shooting at Tuskegee UniversityNov 10, 6:35 PMMissing American tourist in Hungary killed: PoliceNov 9, 1:36 PM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC NewsWhat were the death tolls from pandemics in history? - Our World in DataOur World in DataBrowse by topicLatestResourcesAboutSubscribeDonateGdoc/AdminWhat were the death tolls from pandemics in history?Pandemics have killed millions of people throughout history. How many deaths were caused by different pandemics, and how have researchers estimated their death tolls?By: Saloni DattaniDecember 7, 2023Cite this articleReuse our work freelyCOVID-19 has brought the reality of pandemics to the forefront of public consciousness. But pandemics have afflicted humanity for millennia. Time and again, people faced outbreaks of diseases — including influenza, cholera, bubonic plague, smallpox, and measles — that spread far and caused death and devastation.Our ancestors were largely powerless against these diseases and unable to evaluate their true toll on the population. Without good record-keeping of the number of cases and deaths, the impact of outbreaks was underrecognized or even forgotten. The result is that we tend to underestimate the frequency and severity of pandemics in history.Often, we have records of epidemics occurring in some countries but lack good records from other regions despite knowing that the geographical impact of the disease would have been very wide. Additionally, we often lack knowledge about which pathogens caused outbreaks and, thus, if a historical event can be considered a pandemic or if it consisted of parallel outbreaks of different diseases.To deal with the lack of historical records on total death tolls, modern historians, epidemiologists, and demographic researchers have used various sources and methods to estimate their death tolls — such as using data from death records, tax registers, land use, archaeological records, epidemiological modeling, and more.In this article, I present the various methods they rely on and visualize the estimated impact of what are now considered the major pandemics in history.What is a pandemic?Although there is no universally accepted definition of a pandemic1, diseases called pandemics share several characteristics.Pandemics generally refer to diseases with a vast geographic range — such as spreading across a continent or multiple continents. In addition, they tend to describe outbreaks that are rapidly growing or expanding in range, highly infectious, affecting a large number of people, and caused by novel pathogens against which there is little or no pre-existing immunity.2How do researchers estimate the death toll of pandemics?Researchers have estimated the death tolls of pandemics in different ways, depending on the data available.Some death tolls have been estimated by looking at excess deaths: researchers estimate the additional number of deaths that occurred during a pandemic compared to the expected number of deaths in a typical year. This can be helpful to understand the pandemic’s overall impact, even if records from death certificates are unavailable.For some pandemics, death tolls are estimated from the net population reduction, where researchers calculate the difference in population size before and after the pandemic. This is often used for severe events — such as the Columbian Exchange — where a significant fraction of the population died.Some death tolls have been estimated through epidemiological modeling — based on knowledge of the transmission of the disease and its geographical spread, its fatality rate (the share of people affected who die from it), access to treatment, and other types of data.Finally, some death tolls have been calculated only using recorded deaths (also referred to as ‘confirmed deaths’). This is the number of deaths officially reported with the disease as their cause of death. This method may vastly underestimate the number of deaths caused by the pandemic, as comprehensive historical records are lacking. Even today, cause-of-death registration is lacking in many parts of the world, which is one reason why the number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19 is much lower than the total death toll from the pandemic.A timeline of historical pandemicsI have brought together estimates of death tolls from different pandemics in history for this article, which we have visualized in a timeline below.The size of each circle represents one pandemic’s estimated death toll. Pandemics without a known death toll are depicted with triangles.This overview shows us the vast impact that pandemics have had over history.You can see that the largest pandemics — such as the Black Death — killed more than half of the population. Several pandemics have swept through the population repeatedly: in just the last two hundred years, seven major pandemics were caused by cholera, and the flu caused another seven.Pandemics devastated millions and left a shadow on those who survived. The suffering they caused may once have felt inescapable.Before the formation of germ theory, we lacked good knowledge of pathogens that caused them, how they spread, and how to protect ourselves from them. Before molecular testing to analyze pathogens’ genomes, we lacked a good understanding of how they evolved and changed over time.Our ability to respond to pandemics has been transformed by advances in scientific understanding but truly depends on a wide range of efforts — from data collection to research and communication, public health efforts, healthcare access, and cooperation.For example, the collection of death records allowed scientists to discover how cholera spread and how to prevent it. Coordination to address HIV/AIDS has prevented millions of deaths worldwide. Global testing for new influenza strains has helped adapt flu vaccines each year.With better understanding, resources, and effort, much more progress can be made. The world can respond more swiftly and effectively to pandemic risks and avoid and reduce the impact of future pandemics. But without such efforts, we will continue to face major pandemics as we have experienced so far.Dataset and sourcesThe full dataset and sources used in the chart can be found in our spreadsheet.In the appendix below, I review some of the major pandemics in history and their historical impact and describe how their death tolls have been estimated.Appendix: Major pandemics in the last millenniumThe Black DeathThe Black Death (1346–1353 CE) — one of the earliest pandemics with a methodically estimated death toll — killed around 50–60% of Europe’s population, approximately 50 million people, in just 6 years.3Researchers have established that many people also died elsewhere — as large outbreaks are also recognizable in historical records from Western Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa — but comprehensive estimates of the global death toll are not available.Population censuses were not conducted then, so our understanding of the Black Death’s impact in Europe comes from historical records such as tax and rent registers, parish records, and archeological remains. However, uncertainty remains, as these records come from a limited number of European regions and are extrapolated to the rest of the continent based on demographic estimates.Careful examination of these sources has led to historians revising estimates of the death toll upwards4 and confirmed the bacterial cause of the pandemic: Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis).5People in the fourteenth century were unaware of this bacterium, nor did they know how it was transmitted — from rat fleas to humans — as this was long before the development of germ theory in the late nineteenth century.6Without this knowledge, they also had little understanding of how to protect themselves, resulting in the relentless spread of the Black Death. Even after its initial wave, the pandemic continued with frequent, though smaller outbreaks until around 1690.7Y. pestis caused diseases known as “bubonic” and “pneumonic” plague, where patients experienced fevers, chills, vomiting, and excruciating headaches, and distinctive “buboes” formed in their swollen lymph nodes — typically in the groin, thighs, armpits, or neck.As Y. pestis spreads through the lymph nodes, it emits toxins that break down blood vessels and form clots, potentially blocking blood circulation and leading to death.8Other bubonic plague pandemicsIt is now recognized that the Black Death was not the only plague caused by Y. pestis. Genetic evidence suggests that this bacteria emerged at least 4000 years ago.9The first known bubonic plague pandemic began in 541 CE and had recurrent outbreaks until the mid-8th century. This devastating pandemic affected the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), the Middle East, North Africa, and the Mediterranean.The initial and most severe outbreak, known as the “Justinian Plague” (541–549 CE), was named after Emperor Justinian, who ruled Constantinople then.10The third pandemic occurred between 1894 and 1940, mainly affecting Asia and Africa.Bubonic plague is less common today due to improved sanitation and hygiene measures which reduce the density of rats and rat fleas, improved public health surveillance, and effective antibiotics, but cases have been seen even in recent years in different continents, mainly in small towns and villages.11The Columbian ExchangeThe chart shows the immense impact of the “Columbian Exchange”, with an estimated 48 million deaths.The Columbian Exchange describes the period following Christopher Columbus’s voyage to the Americas in 1492 — during which populations, ideas, and crops, such as tomatoes, potatoes, and maize, spread between the Americas and the rest of the world.But the Columbian Exchange also involved extensive war, conquest, slavery, and the spread of multiple deadly diseases, which led to the devastation of indigenous populations.12Smallpox, cholera, measles, diphtheria, influenza, typhoid fever, bubonic plague, and other diseases had already killed many in Europe. But they tended to be more severe to Native Americans, who had been previously isolated from these diseases and lacked immunity to them.The immense death toll shown on the chart is calculated as a “net population reduction” compared to the pre-1492 population size.The Native American population was estimated to be around 54 million before Columbus’s arrival. Over the following century, around 48 million died, and the population declined to 5.6 million in 1600 — a reduction of about 90%.Both numbers are estimated by compiling data from a range of sources, including archeological records, tribal records, censuses, epidemiological modeling, and land and crop use.13Influenza pandemicsInfluenza (flu) pandemics arise through sudden evolutionary changes in flu viruses when different strains combine to form novel flu strains14, which can be more infectious and lethal than previous ones.Although flu has affected humanity for thousands of years15, comprehensive death tolls have only been estimated for the flu pandemics in the last 140 years.The largest — the 1918 “Spanish flu” pandemic — has an estimated death toll of 50 to 100 million.16 This estimate is a compilation of various historical sources, including recorded death tolls and estimates of excess deaths from different regions.You can read more about the impact of the Spanish flu pandemic in our article:The Spanish flu: The global impact of the largest influenza pandemic in historyThe Spanish flu pandemic had a devastating impact on the global population.The chart also shows the estimated impact of other significant flu pandemics: the 1889 “Russian flu” pandemic (an estimated 4 million deaths), the 1957 “Asian flu” pandemic (2 million), the 1968 “Hong Kong flu” pandemic (2 million), and the 2009 “Swine flu” pandemic (100,000 to 1.9 million deaths).17Their death tolls have been estimated from excess mortality during pandemics compared to the years immediately before and after, using available national mortality records and extrapolation to the global population.Cholera pandemicsAs the chart shows, seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the last two centuries.18 Most are considered to have originated in the Indian subcontinent and expanded across countries and continents through war, travel, and international trade.19Our knowledge of the total global death toll from cholera in history is limited20, but historical reports from across the world suggest an immense impact of the disease. For example, between 1865 and 1947, at least 23 million people died from cholera in India alone.21 But significant outbreaks have been recorded in many more countries.22Cholera is particularly severe because, if left untreated, the bacteria Vibrio cholerae can cause severe dehydration and death within hours or days of the first symptoms.23Its severity has been reduced with a range of scientific advances: the understanding that cholera spread through contaminated water and food, and thus that clean water and sanitation could prevent it; the identification of Vibrio cholerae as the cause; the development of antibiotics; and the knowledge that severe forms of the disease could be substantially reduced with simple rehydration treatment.24Cholera continues to kill, even today. Since 1960, over 900,000 deaths have been recorded from cholera globally as part of what’s considered the “seventh cholera pandemic” — this is shown in the chart.25HIV/AIDSWhen HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) was first identified in the early 1980s, it had a fatality rate of 100%, and patients had a median survival time of about one year after being diagnosed.26 It spread rapidly as the world grappled with recognizing, understanding, and responding to the growing epidemic.HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, attacks white blood cells — which are critical for our immune function — and leaves patients vulnerable to a wide range of opportunistic infections and diseases.Learn more on our page on HIV/AIDS:HIV / AIDSA global epidemic and the leading cause of death in some countries.The timeline shows the enormous and continuing impact of HIV/AIDS, which has resulted in an estimated 33 million deaths worldwide between 1981 and 2022.Our understanding of its death toll comes from available data and statistical modeling. The estimates consider various factors, such as characteristics of the virus’s transmission, behavioral and clinical data, the availability of treatment, and recorded deaths from countries with high levels of death registration. 27The global response to HIV/AIDS has involved international cooperation, resource allocation, and scientific advances in antiretroviral therapy, which together have transformed HIV from a fatal diagnosis to a manageable chronic condition with treatment.In recent years, around 1.5 million deaths have been averted annually due to the effects of antiretroviral therapy — which prevents the virus from replicating and thereby reduces the severity of the disease and its spread to other individuals.This is shown in the chart below, along with the estimated number of HIV/AIDS deaths that still occur — around 600,000 deaths annually in recent years. Click to open interactive versionCOVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic was caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which emerged at the end of 2019 and rapidly evolved into a global health emergency. Characterized by its highly infectious nature and severe respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 has led to widespread illness and fatalities across the world.The timeline above shows the vast global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic — with around 27 million excess deaths between January 2020 and November 2023.28 This makes it one of the deadliest pandemics of the last century.COVID-19’s death toll has been measured by excess mortality, which describes the number of deaths above what would have been expected based on previous years.This method is used because the global number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19 (those where COVID-19 is listed as the cause of death) is certainly much lower than the total number of deaths from COVID-19. This is because, in many countries, testing for COVID was very limited throughout the pandemic, and cause-of-death registration was, and still is, lacking in many countries.29Excess mortality also has the advantage of not only considering deaths directly caused by the virus but also those indirectly caused by the pandemic’s impact on healthcare systems and economies.Learn more about excess mortality here:Excess mortality during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19)To estimate excess mortality, researchers use national mortality data from countries where data is available and statistical models — which rely on data on COVID-19 testing rates, confirmed cases and deaths, population age structure, state policies, and more — for other countries.The estimated death toll we show for COVID-19 — 27 million deaths by November 2023 — comes from The Economist. The main reasons why I am relying on The Economist’s estimates are that they are continuously updated, and their methodology is well documented.In contrast, while the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) have also estimated the number of excess deaths, their latest estimates were only based on the time period until the end of 2021. For this time period, all three sources provide similar estimates (18.2 million deaths were estimated by the IHME; 14.8 million deaths were estimated by the WHO; and 17.8 million deaths were estimated by The Economist).30The chart below shows the excess mortality during COVID-19, as estimated by The Economist, along with the number of confirmed deaths. As you can see, there is wide uncertainty around the total number of excess deaths during the pandemic. However, even the lowest estimates are much higher than the number of confirmed deaths — reflecting the limited amount of testing and death registration globally during the pandemic.

They are defined as occurring ‘when key factors converge: a novel influenza virus emerges that has the ability to cause sustained human-to-human transmission, the virus causes disease, and the human population has little to no immunity against the virus.’However, there is no official definition of a pandemic for diseases in general.Instead, the highest outbreak response designated by the WHO is the ‘Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)’, a formal declaration involving an official institutional process.A PHEIC is used to designate ‘an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response’, and it carries a legal obligation for countries to respond promptly to the outbreak.For more discussion, see also:World Health Organization.

The Black Death: A new history of the great mortality in Europe, 1347-1500. Oxford University Press.Benedictow estimates that upwards of 60% of the population of Europe died during the Black Death, while Aberth estimates around 51–58%.Both compile a vast collection of parish records, tax and court documents, historical reviews, hospital records, and archeological remains to come to these overall estimates. Many records they use are newly digitized and unarchived. They also explain why previous estimates from historians in the 20th century were too low — aside from lacking sources that have been unarchived more recently, they point out that previous records came disproportionately from the nobility, who tended to have better nutrition and hygiene and likely lower fatality rates.In addition, they explain why rural populations were not spared from the pandemic — as rats and fleas, which were vectors for Yersinia pestis, were abundant in both small, rural villages and crowded urban areas.Despite these thorough historiographic estimates, there is remaining uncertainty around the death toll.First, deaths estimated through this method are based on the net change in mortality during the pandemic. This means they can include other events during that time and do not account for declines in other sources of death.Second, available records are limited to Europe, and specifically parts of Europe — such as regions of Spain, Italy, France, and England. Hundreds of communities have been studied within these geographies, ranging from hamlets to towns, villages, and cities. Estimates from these regions are used to estimate the death toll across Europe based on demographic estimates of the population size and structure.Benedictow concludes that available sources largely come to a consistent conclusion that upwards of 60% of Europe’s population died during the Black Death, although other sources such as Christakos et al. and Aberth put the estimate lower, at 40% and 51–58%, respectively.In their working paper, Jedwab, Johnson, and Koyama (2019) estimate that 39% of Western Europe’s population died based on geospatial extrapolation of data from Christakos et al. (2005), which compiled various historical records.Here, I have given a rounded estimate of 50–60%, using the recent and comprehensive studies by Aberth and Benedictow.Jedwab, R., Johnson, N.

The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 24(2), 163–188. https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.24.2.163Estimates for the pre-Columbian population of the Americas, based on historical records and censuses, are generally uncertain because there was a large initial death toll from conquest and disease, because diseases may have spread faster and further than Europeans encountered those communities, and because of a lack of remaining historical records.Recently, archeological evidence has also been used to make estimates of land use, which can then help develop and improve estimates of population size. These have led to revising estimates of the initial population size upwards. They also depend on assumptions about various factors, such as the number of houses in settlements occupied by inhabitants at a given time, for example.The estimates have relied on many data sources and important assumptions. Here, I cite figures by Koch et al. (2019), which agree with other recent estimates by HYDE (Klein et al. 2017), also based on land use, and are similar to previous estimates by Thornton (1990), based on historical death records and epidemiological modeling.Koch, A., Brierley, C., Maslin, M.

Medicine, 54, 361–371.Johnson and Mueller arrive at an estimate of 50 million by compiling a wide range of different mortality records, including vital registration data, excess mortality estimates, and previous historical estimates for specific regions.They explain that there is substantial uncertainty in these estimates due to a lack of death registration in many countries, missing records, misdiagnosis, and a tendency towards underreporting deaths in rural or native populations, and thus state that the true death toll may be up to 100 million.Before this estimate, historians had previously estimated a range of figures: from 30 million deaths globally (Patterson and Pyle, 1991) to 18 million in India alone (Mills, 1986).Recent research (Spreeuwenberg et al., 2018) has estimated a global death toll of around 17 million, using excess mortality estimates from high-income countries with high levels of death registration and extrapolating mortality rates to the global population. However, many sources have found higher flu mortality rates in poorer countries, suggesting this is likely underestimated.Johnson, N. P., & Mueller, J. (2002).

Who were the victims of the Spanish flu?​​The names of flu pandemics don’t necessarily describe where each pandemic originated but tend to describe where they were first reported.Kaper, J.

Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 8(1), 48–86. https://doi.org/10.1128/CMR.8.1.48Historically, this took place during British rule of India, and the disease was spread partly through the travel of soldiers and troops.It’s believed that the endemicity of cholera in the Indian subcontinent is related to the climate around the Bay of Bengal.The seventh cholera pandemic is considered to have originated on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. Still, genetic research has shown that numerous waves emerged from the Indian subcontinent and spread across countries.This seventh pandemic was caused by the El Tor biotype, which is different from the ‘classic biotype’ that caused all previous pandemics.Mutreja, A., Kim, D.

Springer Berlin Heidelberg. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-30144-5_92Until the 1860s, the collection of vital statistics had not begun in India and was also lacking in other affected countries.This estimate comes largely from vital registration data from the time — official death records collected across British India — and is likely to underestimate the actual death toll due to under-recording, missing records, and coverage.Vital registration was instituted across India in the 1870s, and estimates before that come from extrapolating mortality rates from some regions, such as Bengal, Bombay islands, and Madras, to the rest of India.Arnold, D.

However, this figure has limitations: many countries lack surveillance and reporting of cholera cases. Furthermore, some countries use different definitions of cases due to a lack of testing capacity. For example, some countries describe all cases of watery diarrhea as cholera cases during outbreaks due to limited laboratory capacity.Chan, C. H., Tuite, A. R., & Fisman, D. N. (2013).

Smallpox was only a human pathogen. As long as there is a zoonotic reservoir out there, we’ll probably never get rid of flu.”Dr. Ross said research for this vaccine has been in the works for 20 years.Clinical trials will begin at the end of 2024.Latest Daily Health StoriesHow Our Immune System Protects Against VirusesWhen to Take a 'Time Out' While Watching SportsTips for Reversing PrediabetesWhy the Gloomy Weather Makes Some SadTips for Combating 'Decision Fatigue'Do you Have Electsomnia?Halloween 101: Trick-or-Treating Safety TipsHow to Feed your SkeletonRendered: Tue Nov 12 2024 03:58:42 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)FacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramLinkedInPinterestCleveland ClinicHomeAbout Cleveland ClinicCareers at Cleveland ClinicGivingOffice of Diversity & InclusionCommunity OutreachResearch & InnovationsHealth LibraryFree Health eNewslettersResources for Medical ProfessionalsMedia RelationsSite Information & PoliciesSend Us FeedbackAbout this WebsiteAdvertising PolicySocial Media PolicyCopyright, Reprints & LicensingWebsite Terms of UseWebsite Privacy PolicyNotice of Privacy PracticesNon-Discrimination NoticeResourcesBuildingsFacts & FiguresPress ContactsStudio & Live Shot Locations9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 | 800.223.2273 | © 2024 Cleveland Clinic.

She raises hens and roosters along with goats and cows on her three-acre property in Petaluma.Health officials are warning residents of the risk of close contact with a dead or diseased birds.News about the avian flu spreading concerns Paredes --to a degree."You are always concerned. You just try to do what you can to make sure they are OK. But, at the end of the day, there's not a lot I can really do about it. I can't put them in a bubble and prevent any other bird from coming and drinking out of their water," said Paredes.Paredes lives right across the street from Sunrise Farms which is one of two commercial poultry operations in Petaluma devastated by the avian flu.MORE: Egg prices reach record highs amid avian flu outbreakThe California Department of Food and Agriculture has euthanized 80,000 hens at Sunrise Farms and another 170,000 birds will be put down at Reichardt Duck Farm."It's heartbreaking," said Paredes. "I feel bad for them. That's their business. That's their livelihood."ABC7 News reached out to Sunrise Farms and Reichardt Duck Farm for comment, but they did not return our calls."There are two commercial poultry flocks in the county that were impacted last week," said Sonoma County Agricultural Commissioner Andrew Smith."The California Department of Food and Agriculture and local agencies responded to mitigate the impact of that pathogen so that it doesn't spread to other farms, and to depopulate those facilities because there's no cure for highly pathogenic influenza," he said.Food and agriculture experts expect avian flu will drive up the price of eggs in stores.Experts say the avian flu was first detected in Sonoma County the week before Thanksgiving.The avian flu impacted San Benito County this week.The virus is highly contagious in domestic poultry-ducks, chickens, and turkeys and spread through water, feces, and bodily fluids.To prevent the spread, experts say infected facilities are being quarantined and tested.Whether it's a big poultry producer or a small flock owner like Paredes..."You can take precautions. But you can't prevent any of these. There are diseases that are becoming more and more prevalent," said Paredes.

Africa’s poultry flocks, farmers and consumers taking a knock 06-12-2023 | Market trends/analysis | NewsPoultry and egg producers in South Africa are battling with power outages and bird flu. Photo: CanvaThe avian influenza outbreak in South Africa this year has led to the culling of millions of birds in the country, resulting in a 30% reduction in the production of hatching eggs. Poultry farmers, already battling with loadshedding and high costs, and local consumers are paying the price.According to the Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice and Social Dignity Group’s October Household Affordability Index, the price of eggs increased by 19% between September and October 2023, and 36% between October 2022 and October 2023. Chicken feet and gizzards increased by 8% year-on-year and chicken livers by 14%. These are the products most consumed by the poor.The Association of Meat Importers and Exporters (AMIE) warned that there will be a hefty increase in poultry prices over the festive season and into 2024 as a result of the shortages caused by the bird flu outbreak and “the inability of the government to introduce a rebate on import tariffs timeously”, according to Paul Matthew, CEO of AMIE.ALSO READ: Egg shortage in S. Africa: Rationing and shortagesAs reported on MoneyWeb, deputy president Paul Mashatile promised a support package for affected farmers a month ago, and the minister of Trade, Industry and Competition, Ebrahim Patel, asked for an urgent investigation into creating a rebate on poultry imports almost 2 months ago.In the meantime, Matthew said that to address the poultry shortages caused by the bird flu outbreak, the local poultry industry has imported 83 million fertilised eggs on an urgent basis and flown in by air, which he said are 3 times the price of a locally-grown day-old chick.A rebuttalMeanwhile, Izaak Breitenbach, GM of the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) said that AMIE are “quite opportunistic in their assumptions”, adding that SAPA is not expecting any shortages of poultry products this festive season due to avian influenza, “thanks to its quick and focused action at the start of the outbreak”.Due to culling of diseased flocks, the production of broiler hatching eggs was reduced by approximately 30%, he said. “Producers have made up the potential 30% shortfall by importing enough hatching eggs to alleviate any possible shortage,” he noted.Between the various South African producers, Breitenbach said that over 100-million hatching eggs have been ordered, the imports of which have been arriving since early October, he said. These hatching eggs are used to produce day-old chicks which enter the supply chain after 5 weeks.ALSO READ: An egg a day to combat malnutrition in South Africa“This swift and decisive action has already negated the biggest impact on the consumer price. Additionally, fertile hatching eggs are not imported at “3 times the price” of locally produced eggs. While it is slightly more expensive, the cost of the hatching eggs is diluted and absorbed into the production cost of the whole bird,” he said.“Importing eggs is a far cheaper option than importing a whole chicken, or chicken portions for that matter, and secures local jobs in the poultry sector, while bolstering food security for the country. On the other hand, imported meat is a poor substitute for locally produced poultry, and more so now that the ports are overwhelmed…Rebate debateThe International Trade Administration Commission said the investigation process to consider creating a temporary rebate on poultry products is ongoing.Matthew says that while import tariffs subsidise and protect local poultry producers, they are in fact a tax that consumers have to bear. The government’s overall mandate, he said, is to act in the best interests of the people of South Africa – the consumers.Import duties are “an extremely regressive form of tax”, he said, adding that it impacts consumers most directly. He said the 62% import duty on bone-in chicken introduced in March 2020 should have been a temporary measure, but it has been “institutionalised at the expense of consumers”.ALSO READ: Power cuts put pressure on South African poultry sectorBreitenbach, meanwhile, argues that a rebate to stimulate poultry meat imports would be a poor solution to balance supply and demand. “The chicken meat will be delayed on the water for weeks, and there’s fewer than 5 weeks to the new year, when demand for poultry products decreases significantly,” he said, noting that a rebate would only address a shortage of chicken in the market caused by avian influenza, but the industry has already taken the necessary steps to ensure this will not become a reality.“Moreover, rebates on imports will have no impact on price as importers sell at market prices – retailers set these prices, not farmers or importers. Finally, it is simply too late for a rebate – by the time it is announced, it will be too late to address the perceived problem and the delays at port will fail to address the perceived issue,” he said.If poultry supply and consumer pricing is a legitimate concern for policy-makers, they would do well to remember that a blanket rebate on import duties favours foreign producers and provides importers with a generous cost advantage over local producers, he flagged.“Helping South African farmers recoup their losses and rebuild their flock faster would go much farther in stabilising South Africa’s food security by keeping the price of poultry low. Padding the importers’ bottom-line with rebates will do nothing to assist an industry in distress, other than hastening its demise,” said Breitenbach.Biggest poultry producers reports massive lossesPoultry producers such as Quantum, RCL Foods, and Astral Foods have suffered huge losses. This comes at a bad as the industry – together with the country – faces higher costs due to South Africa’s electricity crisis.South Africa’s biggest poultry producer, Astral Foods, recorded a loss of almost US$4 million as the ongoing electricity crisis, coupled with the bird flu outbreak, cost the company R2 billion rand (just over US$100 million), reported Reuters.ALSO READ: Regenerative farming with innovative Eggmobile conceptAstral processed about 4.9 million chickens weekly during the 2023 financial year, which is 16% lower than 5.8 million birds per week the previous year. The company reported a R621 million operating loss in the full-year that ended 30 September compared to a R1.4 billion rand profit last year. Its flagship poultry division’s R1.38 billion loss was partly offset by a R759 million profit from its feed division, which saw 12% revenue growth.Meanwhile, Quantum Foods reported a R35 million (US$1.86 million) loss in the year to end September. The prior year the company posted a R37m profit. The company said it wrote off assets, such as layer hens and breeding stock, worth R155m during the financial year due to the bird flu outbreak. It also had additional costs from feed and eggs that had to be destroyed as part of measures to combat the avian flu, reported BizCommunity.Join 31,000+ subscribers Subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated about all the need-to-know content in the poultry sector, three times a week.

That’s according to experts quoted in a November 30 article in the Atlantic. Among them was Bill Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Although COVID is likely to pose less of a threat over time, it is not expected to ever disappear. For the foreseeable future, “pretty much all years going forward are going to be worse than what we’ve been used to before,” Hanage said. To stave off illness, Hanage recommended a few now-familiar precautions, such as better access to vaccines, improved surveillance systems to track local transmission trends, and improved access to home test kits and paid sick leave. If those precautions aren’t taken, there will continue to be excess disease and death, and “we’re saying we’re going to absorb that into our daily lives,” he said.

The world can respond swiftly and effectively to pandemic risks in the future with better understanding, resources, and effort.To avoid suffering through another large pandemic, we have to take the risk of pandemics seriously. Despite warnings that another one was likely, the COVID-19 pandemic killed more than 27 million people.1We must build the capacity to test for pathogens and understand them: which pathogens put us at the greatest risk, how they spread, and how to tackle them.We know it is possible to greatly reduce the risk of infectious disease. We’ve learned over history how to reduce their impact with vaccines, public health efforts, and medicine.In addition to the old risks, we face new threats from factory farming, genetic modification, climate change, and antimicrobial resistance. With more attention and effort, we can reduce their risks too.On this page, we show data and research on pandemics in history and how we can reduce their risk in the future.Related topicsCOVID-19InfluenzaHIV/AIDSSmallpoxVaccinationResearch & WritingOur history is a battle against the microbes: we lost terribly before science, public health, and vaccines allowed us to protect ourselvesMax RoserWhat were the death tolls from pandemics in history?Saloni DattaniArticles on pandemics in historyThe Spanish flu: The global impact of the largest influenza pandemic in historyMax RoserSmallpox is the only human disease to be eradicated – here's how the world achieved itSophie Ochmann and Hannah RitchieBreaking out of the Malthusian trap: How pandemics allow us to understand why our ancestors were stuck in povertyMax RoserAntiretroviral therapy has saved millions of lives from AIDS and could save moreBernadeta DadonaiteArticles on pandemic risksHow many people die from the flu?Saloni Dattani and Fiona SpoonerHow new vaccines can help with our antibiotic dependenceSamantha VanderslottArticles on COVID-19How do death rates from COVID-19 differ between people who are vaccinated and those who are not?Edouard Mathieu and Max RoserExcess mortality during the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19)Charlie Giattino, Hannah Ritchie, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina, Joe Hasell, Lucas Rodés-Guirao and Max RoserData explorers on pandemicsCOVID-19 Data ExplorerOur World in DataInfluenza Data ExplorerOur World in DataMpox Data ExplorerOur World in DataGlobal Health Data ExplorerOur World in DataInteractive Charts on PandemicsHistorical trends across infectious diseasesNumber of one-year-olds who have received different vaccinationsRespiratory death rate from seasonal influenza, age 65+Estimated cumulative excess deaths during COVID-19Non-Explorer, single-entity versionCholera reported deathsIncidence and prevalence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosisAnnual HIV/AIDS deaths averted by antiretroviral therapyAntibiotic usage in livestock per kilogram of meatCOVID-19 vaccination coverage worldwideMarimekkoDaily confirmed COVID-19 cases by world regionStacked area chart – by world regionH5N1 influenza: monthly reported casesHIV funding and estimated future requirementsHIV funding in low- and middle-income countries, by regionHIV prevalenceUNAIDSImports of personal protective equipment (PPE)Imports of personal protective equipment per capitaMalaria deaths by world regionWHOParalytic polio: estimated cases by world regionSmallpox cases reported worldwideSmallpox deaths as a share of all deaths in London1629 to 1902Smallpox: when was it eliminated in each country?Chart 1 of 21EndnotesThis comes from the central estimate of excess mortality published by The Economist by the time of publication, December 2023.Solstad S.

Home Test to Treat logo What The federal government has expanded the Home Test to Treat program, an entirely virtual community health program that offers free COVID-19 health services: at-home rapid tests, telehealth sessions and at-home treatments, to eligible participants nationwide. Home Test to Treat, which is a collaboration among the National Institutes of Health, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched as a pilot in select locations earlier this year. With its expansion, the Home Test to Treat program will now offer free testing, telehealth and treatment for both COVID-19 and for influenza (flu) A and B. It is the first public health program that includes home testing technology at such a scale for both COVID-19 and flu. The program initially will provide the LUCIRA® by Pfizer COVID-19 & Flu Home Test, the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-authorized test that can detect both viruses in a single test at home. For those indicated, treatment must begin within a limited window from onset of symptoms, underscoring the importance of continuity of care, from diagnosis to treatment. In addition, providing these services virtually, while individuals remain at home, is intended to expedite the time to treatment and the convenience of accessing services virtually from home. Any adult (18 years and older) with a current positive test for COVID-19 or flu can enroll to receive free telehealth care and, if prescribed, medication delivered to their home. Adults who do not have COVID-19 or flu may enroll and receive free tests if they are uninsured or are enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs health care system, or the Indian Health Services. If recipients test positive at a future time, they can receive free telehealth care and, if prescribed, treatment. Visit Home Test to Treat for more information. Home Test to Treat is operated under a NIH/ National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) contract with VentureWell, with a subcontract to eMed.

After consistently releasing daily COVID bulletins for nearly 33 months, the Health Department stopped the daily updates on November 7. Instead, COVID data will be updated on the Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP) on a daily basis.However, COVID data is missing in the five weekly reports that have been uploaded so far. “As communicated by ICMR Director General on November 7, the details regarding COVID-19 testing and positive cases will not be available temporarily in the portal due to technical issues in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal. States have been asked to establish their own system of collecting data. Currently, Karnataka is working on collecting testing data manually from all districts,” a senior official in the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) told The Hindu.Sources said it may take six weeks for COVID data to be included in the weekly infectious disease reports. “Currently, Karnataka is reconciling testing and positive cases reports through ICMR’s covid19cc portal that is used by the sample collection centres to enter data,” the sources informed.Travel comes with risk of spread of virusMeanwhile, hospitals are seeing a rise in patients reporting Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) and influenza-like Illness (ILI), especially after travel. Doctors said travel is recognised as a potential risk, as viruses can be transmitted during transit. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent complications and further spread of the viruses.According to the 48th weekly infectious disease report, 133 SARI and 46 influenza cases have been reported in Karnataka in the week ending December 3. Since November 6, a total of 642 SARI cases and 337 influenza cases have been reported in Karnataka. As many as 9,166 SARI and 3,463 influenza cases have been reported in Karnataka in 2023.The State-run Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) has observed an over-10% rise in patients reporting respiratory infections. Institute Director Nagaraja C. said common symptoms include fever associated with cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, upper respiratory tract infection, and fatigue.The weather factor in BengaluruSachin Kumar, Senior Consultant, Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine at Sakra World Hospital, attributed the rise in cases to a dip in temperature. “We are seeing nearly 10 patients daily in the out-patient department. Those with pre-existing asthma, bronchitis and children are significantly affected.”Brunda M.S., Consultant, Internal Medicine at Aster CMI Hospital, is seeing a significant surge in respiratory infections, mainly pneumonia, lower and upper respiratory tract infection. “We are seeing over six cases a day. This is mainly due to the fluctuating weather. The rapid shift in temperature, with warm days and cool evenings has created an environment conducive for the spread of viruses. Cooler and less humid air can allow viruses to survive longer outside the body, increasing transmission risk,” she said.

The disease, also known as “bird flu,” was found recently in poultry flocks in a number of California counties, including San Benito. Although the risk to the general human public is low, the county’s Health and Human Services Agency is warning residents of the potential danger of handling or coming into close contact with a diseased or dead bird, the county said in a press release. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “Bird flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with bird flu viruses have occurred.” For infected flock or flocks, however, bird flu can be “devastating,” San Benito County Epidemiologist Mallory Schmitt said. Locally, the recent avian influenza outbreak occurred at a commercial farm that deals with ducks and geese, Schmitt said. The disease is so contagious among birds, that a single detected case is considered an outbreak within the flock. “Multiple birds were noted to have a drop in egg production, and was an indicator that something might be wrong with the birds at this particular site,” Schmitt said. The sickly birds were tested, and tests came back positive for bird flu. Public health officials are not disclosing the exact commercial site where the disease was detected, Schmitt said. As a precaution, all birds that came into contact with the infected animals at the site must be euthanized. “Otherwise, it will continue to spread throughout that population,” Schmitt said. The commercial producer is also required to close production for a period of time and clean the site before resuming operations. The recent case of bird flu is the first at a commercial site in San Benito County, at least in recent memory. Schmitt noted that last year, avian influenza was detected in a Canadian goose in the wild in San Benito County. “The scary thing about bird flu is, it affects all kinds of birds. We’re talking about wildlife, too,” said Schmitt. Although the risk to the general human public is low, public health officials say precautions should be taken by those who have job-related or recreational exposure to birds. The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids such as respiratory droplets, saliva and feces, says the county’s press release. Transmission may occur directly from bird to bird or indirectly through people, animals or contaminated objects. “Although rare, symptoms to be aware of include fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, conjunctivitis, headaches, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, or diarrhea. If you develop symptoms within 10 days of exposure to an infected animal, call your healthcare provider,” says the release. The “best practice” to avoid exposure or infection is to avoid handling dead birds or birds that show signs of distress or illness, says the release. While severe cases can occur in humans, symptoms rarely progress beyond those of a common cold. Birds infected with avian influenza may show signs such as weakness, lack of coordination, respiratory distress, diarrhea, weakness and lack of appetite, public health officials said. Wild game birds may be susceptible to infection with signs similar to domestic poultry. To report unusual or suspicious wild bird deaths, fill out an online form at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife site at https:/inyurl.com/38a3v2rr, or report by email at re*****@wi******.gov . Reports can also be made by phone to the SPCA Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Center at 831.624.5427. Sick or dead domestic, pet or collection birds can be reported to the California Department of Food and Agriculture Sick Bird Hotline at 866.922.2473. -PAID ADVERTISEMENT- Featured Local Savings Share FacebookTwitterLinkedinWhatsAppEmailPrint Previous articleCounty schools celebrate Red Ribbon WeekNext articleLetters: No one is above the law Michael MooreMichael Moore is an award-winning journalist who has worked as a reporter and editor for the Morgan Hill Times, Hollister Free Lance and Gilroy Dispatch since 2008.

In a news release on Wednesday, Allegheny Health Network provided guidance for parents and caregivers ahead of the holiday season, saying it anticipates "these numbers will continue to rise this month as we gather and travel for the holidays."Allegheny Health Network said weekly respiratory syncytial virus cases have nearly tripled since early November and Allegheny County is reporting the state's highest flu totals. "Our AHN outpatient pediatric offices have seen an increase in cases of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza, which tracks with what we're seeing nationally," said Joseph Aracri, chair of the Allegheny Health Network Pediatric Institute, in the release. Allegheny Health Network said RSV can be dangerous for infants and older people, with symptoms in children including a runny nose, appetite decrease, cough, fever and wheezing. Guidance from Allegheny Health Network includes treating the symptoms, recognizing when to head to the emergency room, relying on a pediatric team for support and practicing preventative measures. "While it's important to follow preventive measures and practice good health hygiene, it's just as important to maintain normal routines and encourage socialization around the holidays," Aracri said in the release. "This season is an opportunity for children to enjoy spending time with family, friends and loved ones, while also participating in festive activities at school or daycare."Click here for more information and guidance from Allegheny Health Network.

Since then, researchers and observers have reported mass deaths of elephant seals, as well as increased deaths of fur seals, kelp gulls and brown skua at several other sites. Cases have been confirmed 900 miles (1,500km) west of South Georgia, among southern fulmar on the Falkland Islands.Dr Meagan Dewar, chair of the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network, told the Guardian that the situation among southern elephant seals was concerning. “At some sites we’ve had mass mortalities, where we are getting into the hundreds,” she said. “There is a likely chance it could be avian influenza.”So far tests have confirmed bird flu deaths at eight sites across the Antarctic, and the disease is suspected with confirmation from tests still pending at 20 further sites where animals have died.View image in fullscreenA southern elephant seal on the Falkland Islands.

Lethargy, spasms and an inability to fly are symptoms in birds.While a number of seabird cases have been confirmed, many – including the elephant seals – are still classed as suspected, pending lab results.So far there are no recorded cases on the Antarctic mainland – home to unique ecosystems that are some of the world’s most isolated – but the disease is expected to arrive in the coming months as birds move.Dewar said: “It’s devastating to watch that happen and recording all the cases we’re getting.”Penguins are starting to cluster together as the breeding season starts, and this close contact makes them particularly vulnerable. Previous outbreaks in South Africa, Chile and Argentina show they are susceptible to the disease.“If the virus does start to cause mass mortality events across penguin colonies, it could signal one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times,” researchers wrote in a pre-print research paper last month.‘Catastrophic’: bird flu reaches Antarctic for the first timeRead moreMany species in the Antarctic are found nowhere else, so the consequences for the region of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) spreading are unknown.The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research said recently: “Given the dense breeding colonies of wildlife in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions, HPAI is expected to have devastating impacts on the wildlife and to lead to catastrophic breeding failure and mortality events in the region.”The virus has killed an estimated 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru. Dewar said: “If we start to get outbreaks similar to what we’ve seen in South America that could have very big impacts. Emperor penguins and chinstrap penguins have been taking significant declines, so if we get large outbreaks in those species, that could cause further pressure on those colonies.”The current outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1 – which started in 2021 – is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds. The strain spreading in Antarctica is clade 2.3.4.4b, which has decimated bird populations across the UK, continental Europe, South Africa and the Americas, with seabird colonies experiencing losses of 50% to 60%. The H5N1 strain has not yet reached OceaniaView image in fullscreenAdélie penguins during nesting season on the Antarctica’s Danger Islands. Photograph: Michael Polito/AFP/GettyDr Michelle Wille, from the Centre for Pathogen Genomics and the University of Melbourne, who is helping to record deaths, said: “It’s terrible news that it’s now in the sub-Antarctic, and we are very worried about viral spread into the Antarctic. In addition to negative affects on animals, the ‘removal’ of vast numbers of animals from the Antarctic ecosystem may have long-term ecosystem effects.”Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey and the British government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency are identifying possible cases, testing them and sharing data. It is challenging to record what is happening because of the size of Antarctica and the small number of people monitoring it. A number of reports of mass deaths have come through tour vessels.10,000 naps a day: how chinstrap penguins survive on microsleepsRead moreMany places in South Georgia are now closed to tourists and even researchers have to go through a number of procedures to get there in a bid to stop the disease spreading, said Dr Michael Wenger, who trained as a marine biologist and has been working as a guide in Antarctica for 18 years.He added: “It’s already hard to estimate numbers in normal situations, because the area is huge and there are a lot of animals. Now with the areas closed, it’s even harder.” This article was amended on 11 December 2023 because Dr Michelle Wille is at the University of Melbourne, not Sydney as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsAntarcticaThe age of extinctionBirdsBird fluAnimalsWildlifeZoologyInfectious diseasesnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Watch for these signs and symptomsBYErin PraterCOVID, flu, RSV, influenza-like illnesses like rhinoviruses, bacterial infections like mycoplasma pneumonia and Strep A, and many other pathogens can cause pneumonia.Getty ImagesThe U.S. may or may not be headed for a “tripledemic” scenario like it saw last year—one in which three main pathogens drive up illnesses, hospitalizations, and general misery. The term “tripledemic” was a misnomer, experts say, as far more than three viruses—COVID, flu, and RSV—were responsible for the surge in sickness. So were influenza-like illnesses like rhinoviruses, respiratory adenoviruses, and other common coronaviruses, to name a few. Certain bacterial infections, like mycoplasma pneumonia and group A streptococcus, can also cause wintertime infirmity. All of these conditions—and more—can cause pneumonia. That’s why it’s the most common cause of pediatric hospital admission in the U.S., and the most common cause of adult pediatric hospital admission (second only to childbirth). We’ll see plenty more pneumonia this year, whether we have a tripledemic, syndemic, or even a singular epidemic. Here’s what you need to know to keep safe, according to experts. What is pneumonia? Pneumonia is an infection of one or both lungs. It causes air sacs to fill up with fluid or pus, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, and its symptoms can range from mild—cough with or without mucus, fever, and chills—to serious, like trouble breathing. The most common causes of pneumonia are bacteria and viruses, Dr. Carrie Horn, chief medical officer at leading U.S. respiratory hospital National Jewish Health in Denver and a hospitalist, recently told Fortune. What are the signs and symptoms of pneumonia? Symptoms can range from mild to serious, according to the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and may include: cough without mucus fever chills trouble breathing chest pain when you breathe or cough low oxygen levels in your blood Other, less common symptoms can include: headache muscle pain extreme tiredness nausea committing diarrhea Older adults and those with weakened immune systems may have atypical symptoms like: lower-than-normal temperature instead of a fever sudden feeling of weakness sudden feeling of confusion Babies may also have particular symptoms, which can include: vomiting fever cough restless appearance fatigue Babies may also show specific signs of breathing problems, including: bluish tone on skin or lips grunting pulling inward of muscles between ribs while breathing rapid breathing widening of nostrils during breathing What are emergency signs of pneumonia? Severe signs that should cause people to seek medical attention include: chest pain severe trouble breathing low oxygen levels, which may present as a bluish or gray color to the fingernails or lips needing more oxygen than usual a fever lasting longer than just a day or two coughing up blood low blood pressure a cough that just won’t go away passing out a fever over 100.4° F for children 6 months and younger, or above 102° F for children older than 6 months “If in doubt, get the evaluation done by a professional,” Horn adds. What is ‘white lung pneumonia’? In a normal, healthy person, “lung tissue is so delicate that an X-ray passes right through, and the lung fields appear black,” Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, tells Fortune. In those with pneumonia, however, lung tissue becomes bulkier “with all those inflammatory cells that come in,” which makes the tissue more dense, he adds. In a lung X-ray of a person with pneumonia, “the pneumonia part appears white,” he says—hence the nonmedical term “white lung pneumonia” currently trending online. “I think that’s what the name is in reference to,” he says, “although, unfortunately, it sounds very scary.” How is pneumonia diagnosed? In those suspected to have the condition, a health care provider will perform a physical exam and order tests like a chest X-ray. Such tests will help to determine what type of pneumonia they have and how to treat it. What is the treatment for pneumonia? Depending on the type of pneumonia, it may include an antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal medication. If the pneumonia is severe, IV antibiotics and oxygen, administered in a hospital setting, may be required. Very serious pneumonia may require ventilation, a machine that breathes for someone, and/or a breathing tube, as well as surgery to remove an infected or damaged part of the lung. How severe can pneumonia get? While pneumonia involves the lungs specifically, other organ systems can be affected, Dr. Clayton Cowl, a pulmonologist with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., recently told Fortune. “Someone who becomes very ill with pneumonia may have fluid shifts and also have issues with their kidneys or with their liver or with their heart,” Cowl says. What’s more, if the bacteria causing pneumonia spread to the bloodstream, sepsis could result—a life-threatening condition prompted by an infection that triggers a chain reaction throughout the body. “It can cause a whole kind of downstream effect, a bucket brigade,” he adds. “It’s like the juggler with the sticks spinning the glass plates. If one of those sticks starts wobbling and a plate suddenly falls, all of the others can go in a hurry.” Is there a vaccine for pneumonia? Yes, two kinds. But they’re only recommended for those age 4 and younger, and 65 and older. A doctor may recommend that people between those age groups receive one or more of those vaccines if they have a medical condition—like diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung disease, or immunodeficiency—that puts them at higher risk for severe outcomes. Adults ages 19 to 64 who don’t have a health condition that puts them at higher risk, but who want the pneumonia vaccine, should talk to their doctor about it. If they end up receiving it, they may have to pay cash price, even if they have insurance, Horn says. What else can I do to protect myself from pneumonia? Pneumonia vaccines aside, Horn’s best recommendation for all ages is to get the flu and COVID vaccines “to prevent serious lung infections going into the winter season.” Both conditions can lead to pneumonia, in severe cases. What’s more, RSV vaccines are now available for infants at high risk of severe disease, pregnant women from 32–36 gestational weeks, and adults 60 years of age and older. If you have chronic medical conditions, make sure they’re well managed, she advises: “The better controlled they are, the better you will do if you get sick in general.” Handwashing and staying away from sick individuals can also help prevent infections that may lead to pneumonia.For you: The Well Adjusted newsletter: Sign up to get simple strategies to work smarter and live better, in your inbox three times a week.

Kansas City hospitals are preparing for an influx of respiratory illnesses this winter, as influenza and RSV case numbers are starting to rise, and COVID-19 lingers. Cases of three respiratory illnesses are starting to creep up in Kansas City and hospitals are wary of another “tripledemic” as the weather gets colder and people travel for the holidays.Last year, following an unusually early surge in Respiratory Syncytial Virus, or RSV, doctors were left to grapple with the rising case numbers and spikes of COVID-19 and influenza at the same time. The illnesses left hospital emergency rooms bogged down, with few beds available to patients, and led to an increased workload for staff.Todd Shaffer, family physician and professor of medicine at University Health Truman Medical Center, said pandemic protocols like masking and social distancing may played a role. They may have delayed RSV and flu season, so when people returned to a more normal schedule last year, it caused a sharp and earlier-than-expected increase. This year, RSV and influenza case numbers are trending back toward previous baselines, and COVID-19 numbers have held relatively steady. But Shaffer said this is also the time of year when those numbers start to creep up.“As people travel for the holidays, kids come back from college, there is a lot more spreading from different corners of the country,” Shaffer said. “As we go into December and then through Christmas and after the new year, this time of year usually is the worst time of year for any kind of illness, whether it's bacterial or viral.”Right now, Shaffer said there are a little more than a dozen COVID-19 cases in his hospital. Since the public health emergency ended earlier this year, hospitals are no longer reporting this data to local health departments.According to the CDC, only Wyandotte and Leavenworth counties are reporting moderate levels of COVID-19 community spread. That means there were between 10 and 20 new hospital admissions per 100,000 people in the past week. All other metro counties are reporting low spread.Shaffer said despite the low numbers, he still regularly sees patients coming in with COVID-19 and is aware many are using at-home tests. He suspects there is a lot of what he calls “casual COVID” going around — people who have symptoms but aren't testing.Dana Hawkinson, Medical Director of Infection Prevention and Control at the University of Kansas Health System, said COVID-19 may be becoming seasonal in much the same way as the flu and RSV.Hawkinson said COVID-19 numbers have fluctuated at the health system. Last week it had 22 hospitalizations, but this week only 19. But the number of people coming in for COVID testing increased from 600 last week to 800 this week.Influenza testing also jumped from 440 to 664 and the number of influenza inpatients increased from two to 14.According to the CDC, both Missouri and Kansas have minimal influenza activity as of November 25, but surrounding states are reporting gradually increasing activity, which could indicate an incoming surge following Thanksgiving travel.“I do expect those numbers to elevate,” Hawkinson said. “By how much, it's always hard to say, but that's why it's so vitally important to protect yourself by vaccination, especially with the influenza vaccination, which, by all estimates, looks like there is a good match of the vaccine and the circulating viruses currently.”There are currently eight inpatient RSV cases at KU Health System, up from six last week and one just over a month ago.This year is the first when there are vaccines available for all three of these illnesses. But an RSV vaccine intended for infants younger than 8 months old – who are among those most at risk of infection — has been in short supply.KU Health System currently does not have a supply of the vaccine. University Health reports they sometimes have supply but it varies. Children’s Mercy Kansas City does have the vaccine, but with limited supply has to make some tough choices.“The federal bodies that recommend this immunization along with the American Academy of Pediatrics have kind of created guidelines around how to prioritize highest risk infants during this time of the shortage,” said Angela Myers, division director of Infectious Diseases at Children's Mercy Kansas City. “We are following those guidelines to try to target the infants that are at highest risk of having severe RSV infection.”Myers doesn’t expect a sufficient supply of this vaccine during the 2023-24 respiratory illness season, but is optimistic there will be enough next year. There is also an RSV vaccine that's available for pregnant people between 32 and 36 weeks of pregnancy, which can help prevent severe cases, and one for adults over 60 years old.Sarah Boyd, an infectious disease physician at Saint Luke's Health System, urged those planning to travel or gather with friends and family this winter to take appropriate precautions.“If they are sick, think about staying home, and reaching out to their medical provider to get tested, so that potentially if they are a candidate for treatment with antivirals for influenza or COVID,” she said. “And in general, good hand washing, covering coughs, and all of those things can go a long way to prevent spread within the community.” Tags Health RSVCOVID-19CoronavirusfluUniversity of Kansas Health SystemChildren's Mercy HospitalUniversity Health Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Noah Taborda As KCUR's health reporter, I cover the Kansas City metro in a way that reflects our expanding understanding of what health means and the ways it touches different communities and different areas in distinct ways.

Falcon, MD Spread the love If you haven’t gotten a flu shot yet, getting one now is one of the best ways to stay healthier. As the seasons change and temperatures drop, you may have noticed that more people you know are getting sick. While there are a variety of viruses that can cause illness at this time of year, the flu is one of the most common causes of winter misery. Other viruses that may make you sick include COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the common cold. One of the most effective ways to protect yourself, and others, from getting the flu is by getting a flu shot. While health experts generally recommend that people get a flu shot in September or October, when flu season begins, it’s not too late to get a flu shot now if you haven’t already gotten one this year. Flu season starts to peak around now and often continues to spread well into the early part of the new year so a flu shot gotten now will keep you protected when you may need it most. Here’s why getting a flu shot is one of the best ways to keep everyone healthier: It makes it less likely you’ll get sick. The flu vaccine works by stimulating your immune system to produce antibodies against the flu viruses included in the vaccine. This helps your body recognize and fight the flu virus more effectively if you are exposed to it so you don’t get sick. It takes about two weeks after you get the vaccine for antibodies to develop, so the sooner you get a shot, the sooner you’ll be protected. It protects you from severe illness. Even if you do contract the flu after getting the vaccine, symptoms are often milder and don’t last as long as they would if you did not get the vaccine. The flu shot significantly reduces the risk of severe complications, hospitalization and potential long-term health issues associated with the flu. That’s why it’s especially important for people who are at a greater risk of developing complications to get vaccinated. It reduces the spread of the flu. Getting vaccinated doesn’t just protect you—it also helps protect those around you, especially vulnerable populations such as young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. When you get a flu shot, you’re less likely to get the flu and spread it to others. This helps to reduce the overall spread of the virus within the community and keeps everyone healthier. It is recommended that everyone aged six months and older get a flu shot every year, unless there are extenuating circumstances. The vaccine is formulated to target the strains of flu that are expected to be the most prevalent during the current season. So even if you have gotten a flu shot in years past, you still should get one every year to keep yourself protected. Don’t wait until you get sick with the flu to wish you had gotten a flu shot earlier. Make an appointment today to give yourself the best protection against getting sick from the influenza virus. Vaccines are typically available at pharmacies, doctors’ offices and other locations around your community. “We are currently experiencing very high levels of influenza in our state. Vaccination is the best way to prevent and minimize flu severity. RSV, Influenza, COVID and other respiratory viruses have similar symptoms and unfortunately all of these illnesses are on the rise. There are easy nasal swab tests to diagnose these illnesses. We also have antiviral medications that can be prescribed if diagnosis is made early in illness that can lessen severity of disease. Preventing spreading infection to others by staying home when ill and appropriate use of masking around others is extremely important.” -Lara M. Falcon, MD Copyright 2023 © Baldwin Publishing, Inc.

But is there more RSV, COVID and flu going around Berkshire County? Health care providers contend with rebounding RSV and influenza numbers in Berkshire County By Matt Martinez, The Berkshire Eagle Matt Martinez News Reporter Author twitter Author email Dec 9, 2023 Dec 9, 2023 4 min to read Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email As of Nov. 25, about 32 percent of residents in the commonwealth were vaccinated for influenza, according to the Department of Public Health. EAGLE FILE PHOTO Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save PITTSFIELD — As the Berkshires heads into its first post-pandemic winter, local health experts are recommending vaccination and vigilance for COVID-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).The winter months generally mean an uptick in cases of flu, RSV and COVID-19 due to people staying inside more often and cold, dry air making disease transmission more prevalent, according to Dr. James Lederer, chief medical officer of Berkshire Health Systems. And he said the relaxation of precautions taken during the pandemic will likely lead to higher rates of RSV and flu. Dr. James Lederer, the chief medical officer at Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield. EAGLE FILE PHOTO “There’s always been a background of RSV,” Lederer said. “There’s always been a background influenza. Some of these, to some extent, were prevented in the early days of COVID because we masked and social distanced ... now we’re in more of a ‘back to normal’ community belief.”Lederer said that about a month ago, health care professionals were monitoring what seemed to be an uptick for COVID-19 hospitalizations, to the tune of between 12 to 16 patients at a time. Recently, however, that number has dropped — and RSV has become a larger concern.That’s not to say that COVID concerns have gone away. Mitigation measures such as masking, social distancing and vaccination are still recommended to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. Dr. Jonna Gaberman, director of adult medicine for Community Health Programs said sticking to areas with good airflow and avoiding crowds may help too.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that RSV results in over 2 million outpatient visits for children 5 or younger. Between 58,000 and 80,000 children in this age group will be hospitalized, and on average, between 100 and 300 children could die from the disease in a given year.People aged 65 and over are the other primary group of concern: In a given year, between 60,000 and 160,000 people will be hospitalized, and between 6,000 and 10,000 will die from the disease.Lederer said that a recently approved vaccine for RSV should help prevent severe illness in people in the over-65 age group. The RSV vaccine, approved by the Food and Drug Administration earlier this year, is approved for use in individuals 60 and over.Gaberman recommended that people who are interested in the RSV vaccine consult their doctors first to engage in “shared decision-making.” Gaberman noted that the vaccine is recommended for people with underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease, but does have some side effects.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommend people over 60 get the shot after discussing the vaccine with their health provider. Stop & Shop pharmacies offering flu, other vaccinesLederer said that there was a concerted effort to get mothers who were about 32 to 36 weeks pregnant vaccinated for RSV to pass on the protection to the infant. There are also antibodies available to help children who get RSV have milder symptoms.Treating and preventing the disease in children is a priority, Lederer said.“The airways of little kids are much smaller in diameter,” Lederer said. “So a little bit of infection and a little bit of swelling and edema goes a long way. That’s why little kids are so compromised.”'ARE YOU OK TO LEARN?'At the school level, runny noses and lingering coughs are back for the season, too. Cristina Lenfest, school nurse at Richmond Consolidated School, said that this time of the year makes it important for families to pay close attention to how their children are feeling. Cristina Lenfest, school nurse at Richmond Consolidated School, suggests using the "Are you OK to learn?" metric when deciding on sending children to school who have minor symptoms. Lenfest said that informing families of best practices to keep them from getting sick can be critical in the winter months. Reminding children to wash their hands and cover their cough help in the classroom; getting good rest and eating healthy at home are precautions that families can help with.Mild symptoms can make it tricky to determine if a student should go to school, Lenfest said, but there are ways to determine if a child can attend class.“It’s kind of using the metric of, 'Are you OK to learn?’” Lenfest said. “If you’re in class and it’s coughing nonstop, blowing your nose nonstop where you’re interfering with your learning or others’ learning, that’s kind of like a gauge to stay home. Other than the obvious ones, like a 100-degree temperature.”Gaberman also recommended that people get vaccinated for influenza; convincing people isn’t always easy, as many have the mistaken impression that “the flu” is milder than it really is. The use of “flu” as a colloquial catchall term for illness can lead people to think they don’t need to be vaccinated. Columnists Clarence Fanto: COVID, flu, RSV make for a ‘tripledemic,’ but most folks throw caution to the wind By Clarence Fanto, The Berkshire Eagle 3 min to read “We talk about it as if it’s a common, mild infection," she said, "but people can get severely ill from influenza.” Lederer said that getting the flu vaccine could be critical to helping prevent severe symptoms in people. Community vaccination rates are usually below 40 percent, he said, showcasing the difficulty that health care providers have in getting people to take it seriously.As of Nov. 25, about 32 percent of residents in the commonwealth were vaccinated for influenza, according to the Department of Public Health.“It seems as if the symptomatology and the presentation of COVID is much more mild than it once was,” Lederer said. “That will not be the case for influenza.”Symptoms between the three diseases are very similar, and the main concern should be monitoring the severity of symptoms, Lederer said. Gaberman said that anyone struggling with shortness of breath should be seen urgently, for instance, and said that people should call their doctor if they have other concerns.Lederer echoed that, and said that vaccination for all three diseases remains a key way to prevent severe illness.“I wouldn’t try to roll the dice and play the odds game,” Lederer said. “If you’re sick and you feel like you need support: go to urgent care, go to your primary care and get seen.” Matt Martinez can be reached at mmartinez@berkshireeagle.com.

It can be a gold mine of information regarding the prevalence of respiratory viruses like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19). The latest results from Biobot Analytics, an American biotechnology company that has been monitoring wastewater throughout the United States, indicate that all of these viruses are spiking across America. "The respiratory illness season is now in full swing across the US," the report states. It shows active and increased co-circulation of all three viruses. In the case of influenza, the surge is fueled by influenza A (although influenza B is still prevalent) and includes all regions of the Unites States. The highest concentration of RSV cases are in the Northeast, followed by increases in the Midwest and South. As for COVID-19, the wastewater data confirms what hospitalization data has previously shown us: It is "on the rise again, especially in the Midwest and Northeast." The scientists concluded that respiratory illness season "has not yet peaked," and urged people to take precautionary steps like getting vaccinated and staying home if they are sick. This is not the only recent study to examine wastewater for public health data. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is also monitoring wastewater to test for diseases and also warns that COVID-19 cases are spiking. CDC data indicates COVID-19 is still killing 1,000 Americans per week and the wave is expected to increase throughout the holidays, driven in part by variants like BA.2.86 (nicknamed "Pirola"). Luckily the latest crop of vaccines seem to neutralize the virus, as does masking.

Vaccinating against RSV and influenza at the same time is safe and as effective as giving the vaccines separately, research suggests. The promising data comes as three pharmaceutical companies seek TGA approval for their RSV vaccines by next year’s Australian winter. The Pfizer-funded research included 1400 healthy Australians aged 65 and over, who took part during the RSV and influenza season in 2022. Half the participants were vaccinated with Pfizer’s RSV prefusion F protein-based vaccine (RSVpreF) at the same time as the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV), while the others were given the two vaccines one month apart. The vaccine is approved in the US but is currently being evaluated by the TGA. Blood samples were collected before vaccination and one month after each vaccination, and participants recorded any adverse events in an electronic diary or smartphone app. “Robust immune responses were observed when RSVpreF was co-administered with SIIV or given alone,” the researchers said in Clinical Infectious Diseases. “These results support co-administration of RSVpreF and SIIV as an appropriate option as evidenced by non-inferior immune responses and lack of clinically significant tolerability or safety issues.” While the participants were older, the researchers said they expected the results would be similar in a broader population. Infectious diseases paediatrician Professor Robert Booy, from the University of Sydney, said the study looked at vaccine effectiveness through antibody production, not disease prevention. “Within the confines of that, it’s a promising result,” he said. “It’s a rapidly changing field, so it’s important to keep up to date. We could have vaccines against RSV recommended for the very young and the old next year.” The researchers said no serious vaccine-related adverse events were reported, and local reactions were mostly mild or moderate when the RSV vaccine was given alone or with the influenza vaccine. “Systemic events reported after receiving RSVpreF plus SIIV concomitantly (44.7%) were slightly higher than for those receiving placebo and SIIV (41.4%), followed by RSVpreF alone (34.4%), and placebo alone (31.6%). The most commonly reported systemic events were fatigue, and there were no reports of neuroinflammatory or demyelinating side effects, the researchers said. The researchers said most participants had a history of medical conditions “expected in older adults”, such as respiratory and cardiac conditions. Meanwhile, Pfizer, Moderna and GlaxoSmithKline are hoping their RSV vaccines will be approved by the TGA next year. Moderna was “working with the TGA’s priority review process with the hope of having Moderna’s mRNA RSV vaccine available by next winter”, a spokesperson said. A spokesperson for GSK said the company had applied for its RSV vaccine to be approved by the TGA for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in adults aged 60 years and over. GSK “is working with the regulators to ensure the vaccine is available as soon as possible”, the spokesperson said. A study in the NEJM this year showed that a single dose of GSK’s RSVPreF3 OA vaccine prevented RSV-related acute respiratory infection, lower respiratory tract disease and severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged 60 and over. Professor Booy said that as RSV was seasonal, case numbers were coming down in the warmer months. “But because of the covid separation periods, we incurred an immune debt. “A lot of young infants were not exposed. “So instead of a one-year cohort of infants not having exposure, a three-year cohort of young infants hadn’t had exposure so we’ve had more disease, more cases, more transmission, and there will probably be increased numbers again next year come autumn and winter.” Clinical Infectious Diseases 2023, online 22 November Previous Post Next Post Subscribe Login/Register Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Please login to comment 0 Comments Inline Feedbacks View all comments ClassifiedsView all > Choose Highgate Hill Doctors!Brisbane RegionLOCUM GP | WINSTON HILLS3 Weeks (16 Nov – 11 Dec 2024)Sydney RegionBill $350-$450 p/hr KiamaFull time, Fellowed GP roleSouth Coast Post your classified here Sign up to our Newsletter Follow us on Twitter Follow our Facebook page Connect on LinkedIn Receive daily updates on the latest news affecting Australian GPs Sign up to our Newsletter Follow us on Twitter Follow our Facebook page Connect with us on LinkedIn Recent Posts Diagnosis Immunology Five red flags for IgG4-related disease Clinical Genetics Pharmaceuticals More gene testing means safer medication Adolescent & young adult Climate Change Mental Health Heat raises risk of youth suicide Latest ClassifiedsView all >VR GP | SOUTHPORT, QLDMixed Billing, Full Patient BaseGold Coast RegionLOCUM GP | WINSTON HILLS3 Weeks (16 Nov – 11 Dec 2024)Sydney RegionChoose Highgate Hill Doctors!Brisbane RegionBill $350-$450 p/hr KiamaFull time, Fellowed GP roleSouth Coast End of content No more pages to load © 2024 - Medical Republic Log In Register × Log in Username/email Password Lost your password?

Sanofi received approval for Efluelda, a high-dose influenza vaccine for the elderly, in Korea. Efluelda is the first high-dose influenza vaccine approved in Korea for the elderly, preventing influenza caused by type A and B virus strains in individuals aged 65 and older. According to Sanofi, despite high influenza vaccination rates among the elderly in Korea, two-thirds of all influenza-related deaths occur in those aged 60 and above. Influenza infection can significantly increase the risk of strokes by eight times and myocardial infarction by 10 times in adults over 40, leading to severe complications in various organs. Elderly individuals are particularly vulnerable to influenza infection and its complications due to decreased immune function and underlying health conditions, and the protective effect of vaccines is lower than that in younger adults. Sanofi has been focusing on developing vaccines that prevent influenza and its severe complications by setting criteria. The criteria included confirmed infection prevention in labs, reduced hospitalization rates, active use of randomized study designs, using existing standard-dose influenza vaccines instead of placebos as control groups, and consistent long-term research results. Efluelda was the only influenza vaccine that met all five criteria. In randomized clinical trials, Efluelda consistently showed superior influenza prevention and reduced hospitalization rates compared to standard-dose vaccines. The high-dose influenza vaccine, which contains four times more antigens than standard vaccines, prevented 24.2 percent more influenza infections compared to standard-dose vaccines while also reducing the hospitalization rates for influenza and pneumonia by 64.4 percent. Also, a meta-analysis of studies, including randomized clinical trials conducted over twelve influenza seasons on over 45 million seniors aged 65 and above, consistently demonstrated the high-dose vaccine's superior effectiveness in preventing influenza and reducing hospitalizations due to complications. Based on such medical evidence, several countries and health organizations have published guidelines acknowledging the preventive effects of Efluelda against influenza and its complications. "We are pleased to introduce this high-dose influenza vaccine in Korea, which can strongly protect the elderly from influenza and related complications," Sanofi Korea General Manager and Representative Director of Vaccines Pascal Robin said. Sanofi hopes that the elderly in Korea will widely receive this high-dose vaccine, which has been proven to offer a higher level of prevention, through the national immunization program, he added. tweet Related articles Sanofi Pasteur Korea's meningococcal conjugate vaccine trial faces 1-month suspension for labeling violation Sanofi-Aventis Korea expects Nexviazyme to be game-changer for Pompe disease Sanofi’s cold agglutinin disease treatment Enjaymo lands in Korea Sanofi launches combination treatment for hypertension Aprovasc in Korea Lee Han-soo corea022@docdocdoc.co.kr See Other Articles Copyright © KBR Unauthorized reproduction, redistribution prohibited News That You Haven't Seen Mediwhale wins 1st place in MICCAI’s medical AI competition Falls and trips, primary reasons for older adults’ injuries, while youngsters must be careful about electric scooters [Interview] ‘Pediatric care will revive, so don't give up and stay with us’ Potential new cure found for treating glioblastoma resistant to immunotherapy Macular degeneration cases mark a 2.5-fold increase in 5 years Huons to acquire PanGen Biotech to boost biopharma R&D, CDMO biz Philips Korea to launch digital pathology reference site at Seoul Clinical Laboratories Mediwhale wins 1st place in MICCAI’s medical AI competition Comments Log In 작성자 비밀번호 댓글 내용입력 0 / 400 Submit 댓글 정렬 Newest Recommended Top Comments BEST Comments BEST Comments It is automatically exposed by adding up the number of replies and recommendations. 닫기 More Delete comments Deleted comments cannot be recovered.

From: UK Health Security Agency Published 8 December 2023 UKHSA is strongly encouraging eligible people from ethnic minority groups, particularly people from the Pakistani and black Caribbean ethnic groups and individuals living in more deprived areas, to book their flu and COVID-19 vaccines. This will protect them and their families against the heightened risks of these infections during winter. Data from UKHSA’s report on inequalities in emergency hospital admission rates for influenza and COVID-19 in England, published yesterday, shows that for both COVID-19 and influenza, emergency hospital admission rates were higher for people living in the most deprived areas when compared to people living in the least deprived areas. For influenza, there were also persistent differences in emergency hospital admission rates between ethnic groups. In winter 2022 to 2023, for influenza, the Pakistani ethnic group had emergency hospital admissions rates which were on average 2.7 times higher than the white ethnic group. The black, African, Caribbean, or black British ethnic groups had emergency hospital admission rates for influenza which were on average 1.6 times higher than the white ethnic group. Influenza admission rates were 2.6 times higher and COVID-19 admission rates 2.1 times higher for individuals living in more deprived areas compared to the least deprived. This report describes inequalities in emergency hospital admission rates. It does not account for underlying factors that may drive differences between groups, therefore, it doesn’t aim to explain why these inequalities exist. From previous research, we know that the underlying causes of health inequalities are complex, with multiple and overlapping factors. This includes the impact of existing social and economic inequalities, coverage of healthcare interventions, such as vaccination, and pre-existing health conditions. This analysis lays the groundwork for further investigation. There is a need for closer examination into the contribution of underlying reasons for these risks over winter. Further work is also needed on the delivery of interventions, such as vaccination, to alleviate the impact of these infections. Additionally, this analysis provides insight for local healthcare systems, including Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) and Directors of Public Health, to consider the relevance of these national findings at the local level. Together, these findings underscore the urgent need to improve vaccine coverage across ethnic groups and levels of deprivation to reduce the risks associated with both influenza and COVID-19. Dr Mary Ramsay, Director of Immunisation at UKHSA said: Taking up both the flu and COVID-19 vaccines provides the best protection against the virus this winter. We continue to encourage eligible individuals and groups, especially those from ethnic minority backgrounds, to get vaccinated against these preventable diseases. For the week ending 26 November 2023, although 75.2% of those aged 65 years and over in England had received their flu vaccine, just over a third of those in clinical risk groups; and less than a third of pregnant women had been vaccinated. Over two-thirds of those aged 65 years and over have been vaccinated against COVID-19 during the autumn campaign. It’s important to get vaccinated before flu starts to circulate, so we strongly urge everyone who is eligible to come forward for vaccination as soon as possible. Dr Shona Arora, Director of Health Equity and Clinical Governance at UKHSA said: The disparities we have observed, with higher hospital admission rates among Pakistani and black, African, Caribbean, or black British ethnic groups and individuals living in more deprived areas, are concerning. If you have been invited to do so, please do book your flu and COVID-19 vaccinations through the NHS website, the NHS App, or by dialling 119. Both vaccines really can help to protect you and your family from serious illness. Dr Salman Waqar, GP and President of the British Islamic Medical Association, said: Our faith encourages us to consider the implications of our actions on the people around us. That is why we encourage eligible Muslim children, vulnerable adults, and those over the age of 65 not to delay their decision to get vaccinated for free against COVID-19 and seasonal flu. Please take up this offer to reduce your chances of hospitalisation this winter. We know many people in our community have religious concerns about the porcine content of the children’s nasal flu spray, but they should know that the flu injection for both children and adults is free of this and can be requested. Vaccination is a key preventative intervention for flu and COVID-19. Previously published UKHSA vaccine uptake data shows disparities in influenza and COVID-19 vaccine coverage. Among individuals aged 65 years and over, only 55% of the Pakistani ethnic group and 49% of the black Caribbean ethnic group received the influenza vaccine in winter 2022 to 2023, compared to 84% of the white British group. Both the flu and COVID-19 vaccines can be given at the same time. To ensure the highest level of protection, it is important to receive both vaccines as soon as possible to be protected through winter. This means you are protected when infections circulate more widely. You can book your COVID-19 and flu vaccination appointment online, by downloading the NHS app or by calling 119 if you cannot get online. You can also book your flu vaccine by finding a local pharmacy or through your GP practice. With robust UK and global studies supporting the very good safety profile and advantages of both COVID-19 and flu vaccines, ethnic minority groups should not delay.

The outbreak, affecting more than 54 000 laying hens in a high biosecurity facility, raised alarms about the potential for further spread and its impact on food security. In the face of this outbreak, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) through its Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) swiftly mobilized resources and expertise to contain the spread and mitigate the impact on Mozambique's agricultural and economic landscape. Recognizing the urgent need for a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach, FAO ECTAD provided crucial laboratory equipment to the central veterinary laboratory in Mozambique through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funding. This support aimed to bolster the country's diagnostic capabilities not only for HPAI but also for other zoonoses, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of the response required. The outbreak in Mozambique occurred against the backdrop of a significant avian influenza outbreak in South Africa, where millions of chickens were affected by H7N6 and H5 viruses. FAO ECTAD's intervention in Mozambique underlines its commitment to regional cooperation and its recognition of the interconnectedness of transboundary animal diseases and associated impacts on livelihoods, trade and health. While Mozambique had not reported HPAI cases since 2017, the proximity of the affected farm to the Indian Ocean coast heightened regional concerns about potential further spread. FAO ECTAD's support aligned with its broader mission to build Member Nations' capacities to prevent, detect, and respond to transboundary animal diseases, zoonoses, antimicrobial resistance, and food safety threats. To complement its on-the-ground assistance, FAO ECTAD released informative standard operating procedures (SOPs) for HPAI response and best practices for biosecurity measures and disease control, reinforcing its commitment to disseminating vital information. The FAO Representative in Mozambique, Mr. José Luis Fernandez emphasized that "the zoonotic potential of avian influenza viruses is an ever present threat to public health. FAO guidance is available to support the government in reviewing the 2006 contingency plan". In the face of challenges posed by the H7 outbreak in Mozambique, FAO's commitment to preventing, detecting, and responding to transboundary animal diseases has been unwavering. The organization's proactive measures, coupled with the dedication of local stakeholders, exemplify the collective efforts required to safeguard both animal and human well-being in the region.

There are kiddos with mild symptoms of COVID testing positive. RSV and flu symptoms are still going around. There are kiddos that are being admitted with RSV and flu, but this is the time of year we expect this to happen. And asthma and allergy kids are still affected because it gets colder and now it’s supposed to be warmer this weekend – the temperature keeps going back and forth. Hand foot and mouth is starting to fall off, but it’s still around.”Dr. Jennifer Stephens-Hoyer, Emergency Department, Henry Ford Medical Center Plymouth:“In the community, we are seeing a surge of COVID-19, RSV, other viral infections and sporadic influenza cases. In most cases, supportive care for comfort and efforts to maintain hydration is all that is indicated. Higher risk individuals may benefit from other measures. Folks with difficulty breathing, chest pain, inability to tolerate fluids for several hours and other severe symptoms would benefit from urgent in-person evaluations.”Kim Wahmhoff, FNP-C, Henry Ford-GoHealth Urgent Cares:“We are seeing a lot of viruses circulating. We are also continuing to see an increase in positive COVID-19 tests. We also continue to see RSV in kids and older adults causing illness.”Oakland CountyInfluenza, RSV, Covid, hand foot & mouth disease, asthma flare-ups, sinus infectionsDr. Steven McGraw, Chair of Emergency Medicine, Ascension Providence Hospital, Novi & Southfield Campus:“Seeing patients with COVID-19 and Influenza is becoming more common. Both viruses can have similar symptoms, including cough, runny nose, sore throat, fever, headache and fatigue. It’s not too late to get a flu shot to protect against the infection. I’m also seeing patients with strep throat and stomach flu. During the cold months I recommend everyone limit the spread of germs by covering their mouths when they cough/sneeze, stay hydrated, up your vitamin D intake and stay rested. "Sarah Rauner, RN, Chief pediatric nurse practitioner, Corewell Health’s Beaumont Hospital, Troy:“We are seeing an increase in wheezing caused by viral upper respiratory infections, RSV being the dominant one right now. Also, some scattered COVID and other cough/congestion-related sicknesses. We have not seen a big increase in influenza A/B infections yet. However, it is likely headed our way. When we have a lot of upper respiratory infections, especially in little ones, we see secondary ear infections and pneumonias that occur if the illness sticks around. Hand, foot, and mouth has slowed down, but strep is slightly on the rise. The most important takeaway is upper respiratory infection season is here. Cover your cough, wash your hands, stay home when you’re sick and until you’re fever-free for 24-48 hours. Lastly, get vaccinated for what you can.”Dr. Justin Skrzynski, Internal medicine physician, Corewell Health’s Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak:“Right now, the hospital is seeing an increase in respiratory viruses including flu, RSV and COVID. It’s important to be current on vaccinations and stay home if you’re sick in order to remain healthy and protect people most at risk.”Dr. Rena Daiza, Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Bloomfield Twp.:“This week we continue to see asthma and allergy exacerbations as well as continued upper respiratory infections. Hand, Foot, and Mouth disease is also on the rise. It mainly hits kids under 5 but can also infect anyone. Hand Foot and Mouth is not serious but is very contagious.”Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital Emergency Department:“We are seeing a lot of respiratory issues and pain of all kinds. Our top pain complaints are abdominal pains.”Washtenaw CountyCovid, upper respiratory infections, RSV, bronchiolitis, influenzaDr. Marisa Louie, Medical Director of Children’s Emergency Services, Michigan Medicine:“We are seeing lots of RSV and bronchiolitis still in addition to the other common respiratory viruses. There was definitely a bump from the Thanksgiving holiday travel.”Dr. Brad Uren, Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine:“Lots of URIs including COVID. Few strep. Minimal GI illness now.”Washtenaw County Health Department:“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents appear to be increasing. Most Influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw County are Influenza A. Sporadic cases of Influenza B are being reported. Flu-related hospitalizations of Washtenaw residents are currently at low levels. Sporadic hospitalizations are being reported.”Monroe CountyDid not report this week.Macomb CountyViral infections, Covid, RSV, influenza, sore throats, pneumoniaDr. Anthony Joslin, Emergency physician at McLaren Macomb:“There has been a noticeable increase in all types of viral infections, including a slight increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases, though the majority of patients experience mild symptoms. An uptick in RSV cases among children and adults have patients experiencing respiratory distress, persistent cough, and fever. A slight increase in flu cases has resulted in patients suffering from a fever, body aches, and a cough. Cases of gastroenteritis and symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea remain steady.”Dr. Maria Samuel, Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Sterling Heights:“We are seeing more COVID-19 cases. Some patients are also coming in with sore throats – probably from viruses. Some flu cases also, but predominant cases are unfortunately COVID-19 again this week. Most of the cases are related to travel, weather changes and spending time with family and friends.”Dr. Anthony Colucci, Medical director at Henry Ford Macomb Hospital’s Emergency Department:“There has been an up-tick in the number of COVID-19 positive patients that have been seen in our ED the past 1-2 weeks. Either related to COVID-19 for the reason they came into the ED or as a secondary finding for admission/placement purposes.”Livingston CountyDid not report this week.Copyright 2023 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.About the AuthorsSarah Mayberry, M.P.H. headshotSarah Mayberry, M.P.H.emailFrank McGeorge, MD headshotFrank McGeorge, MDDr. McGeorge can be seen on Local 4 News helping Metro Detroiters with health concerns when he isn't helping save lives in the emergency room at Henry Ford Hospital.emailClick here to take a moment and familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines.Loading...Recommended VideosTV ListingsEmail NewslettersRSS FeedsContests and RulesContact UsCareers at WDIVClosed Captioning / Audio DescriptionPublic FileTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoFCC ApplicationsCookie PreferencesFollow UsVisit our YouTube page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Facebook page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Instagram page (opens in a new tab)Visit our X page (opens in a new tab)Visit our RSS Feed page (opens in a new tab)Get Results With OmneIf you need help with the Public File, call (313) 222-0556.At WDIV, we are committed to informing and delighting our audience.

Jisoo to star in upcoming zombie series InflJisoo is all set to return to acting with the upcoming zombie K-drama Influenza. Korean zombie titles like Train to Busan and the recent All of Us Are Dead tend to garner significant buzz. Jisoo's involvement in the show has generated all the more excitement. Fans are curious about the rest of the cast, including Park Jung-min, although his role is still unconfirmed. Influenza is a gripping story that begins with a strange flu outbreak, causing people to turn into zombies. Set in a bustling Seoul tower, the plot follows Lee Jae-yoon, who is serving in the defence unit, and his girlfriend Kang Young-joo (played by Jisoo). As the sickness spreads, chaos ensues within the building as infected individuals transform into zombies. Amidst the zombie threat, Jae-yoon and his colleagues find themselves in a desperate situation. They must protect themselves and others as the number of zombies in the building continues to grow. In a twist of fate, Jae-yoon and Young-joo unexpectedly reunite while facing the relentless horde of the undead. Influenza marks Jisoo's second K-drama project after Snow Drop, and she has expressed that her role in the series is very challenging. Jisoo has mentioned that she will undergo training to handle the action scenes in Influenza. The series is expected to stand out due to its storyline and the involvement of screenwriter Han Jin-won, renowned for his work on the critically acclaimed film Parasite. Han Jin-won, along with director Bong Joon-ho, made history as the first Asian storytellers to win an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay at the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020.See Also: BLACKPINK’s Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé and Lisa renew contract with YG Entertainment for group activities More on - Jisoo, InfluenzaNext Story :Rita Ora pays an emotional tribute to Liam Payne at MTV EMA 2024 Next StoryMost Popular5 WTF moments from the Without Remorse trailer that kept us grippedRedken Makes a Bold Statement with its Debut in India, Revolutionizing the Hair IndustryTimothee Chalamet and Kylie Jenner were openly making out at the US Open finalSon Ye-jin shares an adorable pic of her and Hyun Bin's baby Our Review ProcessFemina's content is created, fact-checked, and reviewed by qualified writers, editors, clinicians, and other contributors.Keeping high journalistic StandardsPrioritizing accurancy, empathy, and inclusivityWe're working hard to continually improve, so we want to hear from you if we could be doing better.

Small children, people with pre-existing conditions and the elderly are at an increased risk of dying from a serious flu infection. Up to 650 000 people succumb to the disease every year around the globe. In industrialized countries, most of these deaths occur in the age range of 65 and older. Knowing this, it is surprising how few elderly people are regularly vaccinated against the disease even in more prosperous nations.In fact, immunization rates vary widely across the globe. The United Kingdom tops the list of the best vaccination rates among OECD nations. South Korea and the U.S., as well as Chile, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Denmark are also among the group of countries with immunization rates above 70 percent among seniors. According to data from the OECD, Eastern European countries and Turkey have the lowest rates in the ranking.During the coronavirus pandemic, flu shots were deemed "more important than ever", because they protect from dangerous co-infections with both viruses that can be especially lethal for older people.Nations that vaccinate a lot of older people often do so as a result of government immunization programs directly targeting the elderly. In Brazil, for example, immunization campaigns have been taking place since 1999, where flu shots are given out for free.

Harris5 Show authors Scientific Reports volume 13, Article number: 21457 (2023) Cite this article 1229 Accesses 2 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Infectious diseasesStatistics AbstractSocial distancing interrupted transmission patterns of contact-driven infectious agents such as norovirus during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since routine surveillance of norovirus was additionally disrupted during the pandemic, traditional naïve forecasts that rely only on past public health surveillance data may not reliably represent norovirus activity. This study investigates the use of statistical modelling to predict the number of norovirus laboratory reports in England 4-weeks ahead of time before and during Covid-19 pandemic thus providing insights to inform existing practices in norovirus surveillance in England. We compare the predictive performance from three forecasting approaches that assume different underlying structure of the norovirus data and utilized various external data sources including mobility, air temperature and relative internet searches (Time Series and Regularized Generalized Linear Model, and Quantile Regression Forest). The performance of each approach was evaluated using multiple metrics, including a relative prediction error against the traditional naive forecast of a five-season mean. Our data suggest that all three forecasting approaches improve predictive performance over the naïve forecasts, especially in the 2020/21 season (30–45% relative improvement) when the number of norovirus reports reduced. The improvement ranged from 7 to 22% before the pandemic. However, performance varied: regularized regression incorporating internet searches showed the best forecasting score pre-pandemic and the time series approach achieved the best results post pandemic onset without external data. Overall, our results demonstrate that there is a significant value for public health in considering the adoption of more sophisticated forecasting tools, moving beyond traditional naïve methods, and utilizing available software to enhance the precision and timeliness of norovirus surveillance in England.

This has boosted the development of new modelling methods specifically targeting the challenges of using public health surveillance data4. In terms of external data sets, two popular choices across countries and pathogens are weather data such as air temperature, and digital data such as relative internet searches5,6. The importance of forecasting applications and use of externally sourced data in public health was further underlined by the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, mobility data played an important role in understanding the impact of Covid-19 prevention and control measures on human behaviour7. The transmission patterns and seasonality of pathogens unrelated to the cause of the pandemic such as those causing gastrointestinal infections were altered by the pandemic8. Additionally, temporal disruption to pathogen reporting hindered interpretation of the historical data that are used for comparison with an ongoing season to highlight changes in activity9.Norovirus is a highly infectious viral agent causing short but intense symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting10. The majority of reported norovirus infections in England originate from outbreaks in closed and semi-closed settings such as care homes and hospitals10,11. However, the surveillance system underestimates sporadic cases of norovirus infections, with 239 to 346 community cases for every laboratory-confirmed report12. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of norovirus significantly decreased during the pandemic and this impact was more pronounced compared with a less outbreak-driven pathogen8,9. Previous research highlighted the importance of contact patterns and person-to-person transmission in the context of norovirus prediction13.Currently, unusual activity of norovirus in England is highlighted by comparing the latest activity to historical data. Multiple sources of activity are available such as local outbreak reporting and laboratory-confirmed reporting. Additionally, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) monitors circulating norovirus strains and captures real-time levels of gastrointestinal symptoms via syndromic surveillance. However, potential drawbacks of these approaches include (1) norovirus-specific reporting and strain monitoring has a built-in delay due to the time necessary to process stool samples; and (2) real-time syndromic surveillance inevitably contains false signals since it measures symptoms which can be attributed to gastrointestinal pathogens other than norovirus.Externally sourced data have been used for norovirus prediction14,15, but more comprehensive evaluation of norovirus forecasting in England is lacking. This study investigates the predictive performance of three forecasting approaches with various covariates compared with the currently used naïve forecast of a week-based five-season mean before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. The three approaches cover popular choices in terms of family of methods (e.g. time series, regularized regression, algorithms) and data sources such as air temperature data and relative internet searches. Additionally, we test the statistical significance of the predictive performance improvement that can be achieved by the inclusion of Central England Temperature, Google Trends and Community Mobility data.MethodsData and pre-processingNorovirus laboratory reportsWe utilized weekly laboratory reports of norovirus infections that are routinely collected in England. The national data between Week 27, 2009 to Week 26, 2021 were extracted from the Second-Generation Surveillance System16. Data spans from summer (week 27) to summer (week 26) since norovirus reporting reaches peak activity in winter. While this data set is already curated, we added a zero entry in case no reports were received on a given week. The laboratory data are characterized as (1) non-negative integers, the minimum number of reports is zero, (2) autoregressive, current number of reports depends on the reports from previous weeks, (3) seasonal, visible peak in winter, (4) heteroskedastic, predictive error tends to be higher during the winter peak of norovirus activity, and (5) overdispersed, variance in the data is higher than expected.Additionally, further categorical indicators were derived from the data based on exploratory analysis. Specifically, we indicate the week of Christmas holidays (Week 52), the initial weeks of the pandemic in England and the ongoing impact of the pandemic. We also used the laboratory data to fit norovirus seasonality with Fourier terms and calculate a three-week moving mean. As the laboratory data are inherently delayed due to the time required for a sample to reach diagnostic laboratories and to be tested and reported, it is common practice to not use the number of reports from the previous week. The smoothing via three-week moving mean allows leveraging of the available, but uncertain data point and increase of its reliability by combining with two datapoints prior.Central England temperatureCentral England Temperature (CET) is a time series indicating air temperature in England and is provided by Hadley Centre under the Met Office, a national meteorological service for the UK. Previous research suggests the Central England Temperature has a strong relationship with norovirus laboratory data14, but the variable has not been evaluated in the predictive modelling setting. We downloaded the daily data from the Met Office website17. Daily time series were aggregated to weekly level by calculating the mean value using “Zoo” R package18 and lagged (i.e. delayed) by three weeks to match the real-world setting where norovirus laboratory data lagged by one or two weeks are not available.Community mobility dataCommunity Mobility data is a time series starting from 17th February 2020. It captures the change in the number of visitors to public spaces in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic. Six categories of public spaces are available: Residential, Grocery and Pharmacy Stores, Retail and Recreation, Transit Stations and Workplaces. Due to a strong seasonal pattern in park visits, we excluded this category from the analysis. Note that the data captures only users who enabled sharing of their location history with Google.Data can be extracted from Covid-19 Community Mobility Reports Google provides in pdf format. We used a pre-processed and smoothed version of the time series from Our World in Data19 downloadable in a csv format and better suited for dynamic analysis. Similar to the CET time series, mobility data were adjusted to weekly granularity by calculating a mean across daily values and lagged by three weeks. Additionally, further experimentation was necessary to determine handling of the missing data points before February 17, 2020. We considered two alternatives, (1) replacing missing data with random sequence based on the random noise component from the individual time series between June 2021 and June 2022, and (2) extracting seasonal component and the mean of the random noise component. To extract seasonality and random noise, each mobility time series was decomposed using a decompose function from the “stats” R package20. The two options were compared in the Count Time Series GLM model described later. The lower AIC indicated the option with the seasonal component (AIC = 5758.79) filled the missing values better in comparison to the option without seasonal component (AIC = 6104.98). Figure 1 shows the mobility data time series alongside norovirus laboratory reports.Figure 1Norovirus laboratory reports and imputed Community Mobility Data.Full size imageRelative search volumesFor relative internet searches we used public application programming interface (API) for R implemented in “gtrendsR” package21, which allowed us to access and download Google Trends results programmatically. Google trends offer relative internet search volumes, which means that selecting a different period can result in different values for a particular week. Therefore, to faithfully represent the real-world setting, the data for the prediction assessment were extracted week-by-week, i.e. the data is downloaded as a fresh set of data every week when predictions are produced.Search term selection was conducted in an automated manner described here22. Briefly, we downloaded norovirus-related search terms by first extracting internet searches for the keywords “norovirus” and “stomach bug” and continuing with all the related search terms provided by Google Trends. We then repeated the same process for all the related search terms. Finally, the time series for the identified search terms were lagged by three weeks, merged with the national norovirus laboratory reports and Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated. Search terms including a number and those weakly correlated with laboratory report (coefficient < 0.20) were removed. The selection period ranged from September 2014 and 2019 and resulted in 14 search terms: "symptoms norovirus", "norovirus how long", "symptoms of norovirus", "norovirus incubation", "norovirus treatment", "what is norovirus", "norovirus outbreak", "sickness bug", "stomach bug", "norovirus first symptoms", "norovirus", "stomach flu", "flu symptoms" and "gastric flu".Statistical analysisThe goal of the statistical analysis is to predict the number of norovirus laboratory reports 4 weeks ahead following the last report in the time of pandemic. We selected three approaches for comparison based on the statistical characteristics of the laboratory data and the ability to incorporate additional data sources—generalized linear model (GLM) for count time series, Regularized GLM with Cross Validation and Quantile Regression Forest. The response variable is the same in all the approaches—the weekly time series of norovirus reports in England. However, not all the approaches use all of the data sources or newly created explanatory variables described in the Data and Pre-processing section. This is summarized in Table 1.Table 1 List of variables and modelling approaches.Full size tableAfter the data is imported and prepared for the analysis, we split the merged data set into two sections: training and testing. To estimate the error, we dynamically extend the training data in a stepwise fashion, week-by-week. Testing data are then the 4 following data points. This means that the training iteration always started in Week 27, 2009, but ended in different weeks. For example, the first iteration of the training data ended in Week 38, 2017, the second in Week 39, 2017 and the last iteration ended in Week 19, 2021. Equivalent testing data ranges were Weeks 39–42, 2017 for the first evaluation iteration, Weeks 40–43, 2017 for the second and Weeks 20–23, 2021 for the last. We only evaluated the period between calendar weeks 40 to 20 which is more difficult to predict as it includes the high season due to outbreaks. Note the difference between the calendar weeks and the trainingesting data weeks. In the real-world setting, the predictions generated on the 40th calendar week, could only use data up-until week 38 due to reporting delay and so the 1-week-ahead forecast is a hindcast, 2-weeks-ahead is a nowcast and the 3 and 4-week-ahead predictions are true forecasts. During this procedure, we kept track of the prediction type (1-week-ahead, 2-weeks-ahead, etc.) and the norovirus season (e.g. Week 27, 2017–Week 26, 2018).Finally, predictions from the testing data are evaluated against the observed norovirus laboratory reports with two metrics: weighted interval score (WIS)23 implemented in “scoringUtils” package24 and Pearson Correlation Coefficient from “stats” package20 . WIS assess the forecasting approaches based on prediction intervals and the lower the score the better. Pearson coefficient indicates trend of point predictions and higher values indicate better trend prediction. The results are presented for each of the four prediction types. The result section also provides pre-pandemic, early pandemic and post-pandemic onset aggregations with and without the inclusion of a particular externally sourced data. A permutation test is used to assess statistical difference between the WIS metric across the pre-, early and post-pandemic onset aggregations with and without CET, Google Trends and mobility data within each modelling framework.To compare modelling forecasts to the naïve forecast, we use relative Mean Absolute Error (rMAE) that assess point-prediction accuracy. Naïve forecasts are calculated as a mean of historical values across previous 5 years for a given week, i.e. five-season mean. For example, five-season mean for a week 40, 2020 would be calculated as a mean of week 40 from years 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015.Generalized linear model for count time seriesGeneralized Linear Model (GLM) for count time series is a simplified name for Integer-valued Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (IN-GARCH)25 models. These models are based on generalized linear regression (GLM) utilising quasi conditional maximum likelihood estimation to fit a negative binomial distribution that can account for overdispersion. The method is implemented in R in the “tscount” package26. The main advantage of this implementation is the convenience of straight forward specification. We can consider the seasonal and autoregressive nature of the norovirus laboratory reports by regressing on past values. Therefore, we did not use pre-fitted Fourier terms seasonality and three-week moving mean as explanatory variables. However, CET, the community mobility data, linear trend and categorical indicators for Christmas and pandemic were included.Regularized GLM with cross-validationRegularisation is a commonly used method to extract a signal from a high number of explanatory variables as it shrinks coefficients of less relevant covariates. The regularization parameter is selected through a process of cross-validation. The parameter achieving the lowest prediction error on the validationesting portion of the data is selected for the regularization. The implementation from the “mpath” R package27 fits a negative binomial model via penalized maximum likelihood where the penalized log-likelihood is maximized. We used this method to extract the relevant signal from relative search volumes from Google Trends, mobility and air temperature data to predict the number of norovirus laboratory reports. As this method does not assume a sequential nature of the data, we included a 3-week rolling mean and pre-fitted seasonality derived from norovirus laboratory reports to account for autocorrelation and seasonality. Categorical variables were excluded as this is not a time-series model. Prediction intervals were derived from a GLM following Negative Binomial distribution without regularization implemented in “MASS” package28.Quantile regression forestQuantile regression forest is a nonlinear method that does not assume a specific data distribution. As the random forest, at its core is a high number of binary decision trees built from bootstrapped data samples. Individual predictions from the trees are then aggregated. Additionally, the trees choose random predictors at every split. Quantile regression forest is a generalisation of random forest. The main advantage is that it provides approximations of the full conditional distribution compared with a mean value provided by random forest. We used the implementation of the method in “quantregForest” R package29. The explanatory variables used in this model include CET and mobility data. Similarly, to Regularized regression, categorical variables were excluded and autocorrelation and seasonality were handled by pre-fitted seasonality and 3-week moving mean.ResultsIn this section, forecasting performance of each approach is presented for each forecasting horizon and model type based on which external dataset was included in a stepwise fashion. We consider three periods, the first norovirus season during the pandemic (week 40, 2020–week 20, 2021), the early Covid-19 pandemic and end of norovirus season 2019–2020 (week 12–week 20, 2020) and the pre-pandemic period (week 40, 2017–week 11, 2020). We tested the differences between models within forecasting approaches weighted interval scores for all period using permutation test.Comparison of predictive performance during the 2020/21 norovirus season (Fig. 2) indicates that including Google Community Mobility data significantly improved the WIS of Quantile Regression Forest (p < 0.001) and Negative Binomial GLM (p < 0.010) compared to model versions with no external data. Count Time Series GLM did not benefit from inclusion of mobility or CET data during this period (Supplementary Table 1). In terms of trend prediction, QRF with mobility data showed the strongest coefficient across predictive horizon (0.40 > ρ > 0.24). Regularized Negative Binomial GLM showed the weakest correlation.Figure 2Comparison of predictive performance across forecasting approaches: the first norovirus season during the Covid-19 pandemic (week 40, 2020–week 20, 2021).Full size imageIn contrast, the correlations of predicted and observed values are the strongest for the Regularized GLM during the early period of the pandemic, while QRF shows the weakest association (Fig. 3). This pattern is present in the weighted interval scores too. Regularized GLM models with CET and Google trends data provide significantly lower WIS for the 1–2 week forecasts (p < 0.009) and the inclusion of mobility data provides similar performance to the baseline Regularized GLM. However, Time series GLM nowcast and 1–2 week forecasts benefit from CET and mobility data significantly (p < 0.045).Figure 3Comparison of predictive performance across forecasting approaches: early Covid-19 pandemic period and the end of norovirus season 2019–2020 (week 12–week 20, 2020).Full size imageEven in the pre-pandemic period (Fig. 4), seasonal components of the mobility variables improve the accuracy and showed stronger correlation for the Time Series GLM-based approach, particularly for the future horizon (3–4 weeks ahead). Additionally, the weighted interval score improved significantly when CET and mobility seasonal component were added for all predictive horizons (p = 0.000). Concerning Regularized GLM approach, WIS also improves with every addition of external data sets significantly (p = 0.000) compared to the model without externally sourced data. On the other hand, adding external data to the QRF approach does not provide significantly different predictive performance compared to the basic model.Figure 4Comparison of predictive performance across forecasting approaches: Covid-19 pre-pandemic period (week 40, 2017–week 11, 2020).Full size imageInclusion of CET and seasonal component of mobility variables on top of Google Trends, shows only a small reduction in WIS (Fig. 4). In contrast, the trend prediction is impacted negatively when externally sourced data are integrated into the Regularized GLM model.Finally, we compare all point-predictions from the forecasting models to the naïve forecast in the form of five-season mean (Supplementary Table 2). All models tend to regress to the historical mean as the time passes, i.e. the 4-weeks ahead forecasting MAE tends to be closer to the five-season MAE. During 2020/21 norovirus season, models with mobility data showed lower MAE by 45% (QRF), 35% (Regularized GLM), 30% (Time Series GLM) on average across forecasting horizons. However, the improvement of point-prediction accuracy against five-season mean is lower for the 4-weeks ahead forecast across models and approaches during the same period—0–30% (QRF), 0–31% (Regularized GLM), 0–8% (Time Series GLM).Relative MAE for the pre-pandemic period shows that approaches with seasonal components of mobility data improve the point accuracy compare to the five-season mean by 7% (QRF), 22% (Regularized GLM), 17% (Time Series GLM) on average across forecasting horizons.DiscussionPredictions of confirmed norovirus infections can provide a timely indicator of current and near-future norovirus activity. Our study underscores the utility of applying statistical modelling and integrating externally sourced data into norovirus surveillance, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. By comparing three distinct statistical approaches, we demonstrated that each method outperformed the naïve forecast, traditionally used in norovirus surveillance in England. Our results highlight the need for adaptable forecasting models. The relative point-prediction improvement of our models reached 30–45% compared to the naïve forecast during the 2020/21 norovirus season which was impacted by the pandemic. This is expected considering the naïve forecast is based on historical seasonal mean, even if reduced by 90% in scale. However, we demonstrated that forecasting approaches explored in this study can improve the point-prediction between 7 and 22% on average across the 4-week forecasting horizons even before the pandemic. This suggests, that with norovirus laboratory reports returning to their previous seasonal pattern, statistical models from this study are likely to provide point-prediction improvement over the historical seasonal mean after the Covid-19 pandemic.The results focused on the first norovirus season following the Covid-19 pandemic indicate that the Count Time Series GLM approach provides the best performance when no external data is used. Its predictive scores were very similar to those from Regularized GLM incorporating air temperature, internet searches and mobility data. However, the Time Series GLM approach showed improved predictions when Community Mobility variables were included as covariates early in the pandemic. Further, our findings show that even the backfilled mobility data based on seasonal component improved predictive performance of GLM-based models during the pre-pandemic period when the real-time data was not available. Quantile Regression Forest showed the poorest predictive performance for the period of early pandemic suggesting this approach is not sensitive to sudden changes in the data. Including mobility variables in QRF in the first norovirus season after the pandemic onset improved the forecasting scores and predicted the trend better than the other two approaches.In the period before the Covid-19 pandemic, Regularized GLM with Negative Binomial distribution showed the best predictive performance in terms of forecasting score and showed 35% improvement in the point-prediction when compared to the naïve forecast (five-season mean). While the performance improved when we included the Google Trends variables as covariates, the improvement became incremental with inclusion of further variables—Central England Temperature, seasonal component of Mobility data. Conversely, trend prediction deteriorated when external data sources were incorporated. Therefore, it is important to consider the specific practical application of a forecasting model. Given the challenges of acquiring and selecting relevant Google Trends data, the effort required in some instances might outweigh the benefits for enhancing norovirus forecasting in England.The improvement in predictive performance through mobility data underlines the importance of societal, economic and cultural trends for predicting highly contagious pathogens. Decreased mixing in public places can have a long-term impact on infections driven by contact patterns, including decreased levels of norovirus infections. Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, norovirus laboratory reports decreased with reduced mobility, likely due to genuinely decreased transmission8,9. As Covid-19 control measures were relaxed, exploratory analysis of the mobility data still suggests a shift in the visit frequencies to workplaces, groceries, pharmacies, etc. People spend 5% more time in residential areas and less in transport stations and workplaces compared with before the pandemic. A report from McKinsey Global institute suggests that the remote working trend might slow down but persist in advanced economies30. Thus, we can expect the changes in levels of mixing to continue and consequently impact norovirus transmission. Additionally, the remote work trend concerns mainly white-collar work, which has the potential to further exacerbate existing health inequalities regarding gastrointestinal infections31.Previous studies showed that short-term forecasting successfully delivered more accurate predictions than traditional and easy-to-obtain naive forecasts such as mean across the past seasons for a given week4,32. However, the accuracy of long-term forecasts was similar to the naïve forecasts. We also observed this effect with all approaches. Therefore, it is essential to differentiate between application contexts and whether long- or short-term forecasting can bring most benefits. Naïve forecasts such as the five-season mean remain better suited in contexts where long-term disease activity pattern needs to be considered. However, the relatively more accurate short-term predictions of highly contagious infection agents such as norovirus can be helpful in weekly or monthly capacity planning at hospitals. Also, it is important to note the difference between explanatory or descriptive modelling and predictive modelling33. Long -term contexts may still utilize statistical modelling to improve understanding of the underlaying process generating surveillance data but in the short-term, when the predictive performance of the models is the goal, machine learning approaches can be more suitable34. Our results demonstrate that the predictive performance of the Quantile Regression Forest and Regularized GLM benefited from external data more than the time series approach during the first norovirus season after the Covid-19 pandemic onset. On the other hand, Time Series GLM allowed for time dependent categorical indicators to be specified such as weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic onset and so no external data were required to achieve good predictive performance.Developing a process to estimate pathogen activity that relies on externally produced data carries risks from the public health perspective. Thus, the effort required to adapt a modelling approach and pre-process the external data would be in vain if the external data set became unavailable. This is exemplified with the community mobility data when in October 2022, Google stopped producing new reports. However, the results show that our approximation of respective Community Mobility variables improve the prediction of norovirus laboratory reports from the Time Series GLM in the period before the Covid-19 pandemic. This suggests that the combination of seasonality and noise derived from the available data could be used to fill in missing time points, serving as a continuation of the real-time data in upcoming seasons. In this manner, we can account for the disruption in norovirus activity during the pandemic while also addressing the absence of data after it became unavailable. Nonetheless, further research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Additionally, a variety of private mobility data sources similar to the one used in this study can be accessed via Development Data Partnership Organisation35. Considering the improvements achieved by using Community Mobility data from Google specifically, this data set should be included in the Development Data Partnership for public health benefit.In terms of limitations, the forecasting approach leveraging Google Trends could be further refined if the search-term selection is repeated at the beginning of every season, since the specific terms can change as language and public familiarity with a particular pathogen change22. Additionally, the study was undertaken before norovirus laboratory report counts had rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. Nonetheless, recent data from the 2022/23 season36 imply a return to previous norovirus activity patterns, suggesting the applicability of insights gained from pre-pandemic and pandemic models. Moreover, the study highlights that existing software offers good options for norovirus forecasting that can supplement the naïve forecast currently used in norovirus surveillance practice. Future research could focus on understanding what methods predicted the rebound in norovirus laboratory reports most accurately.In conclusion, this study describes the potential of externally sourced data to improve the accuracy of norovirus forecasting in England. The results demonstrate that incorporating mobility data and derived data signals can significantly improve the accuracy of some forecasting models, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, different forecasting approaches forecast norovirus reports more accurately across investigated time periods. While Regularized GLM showed the best predictions before the pandemic, the Count Time Series GLM without any externally sourced data displayed the strongest forecasting score in the first norovirus season after the Covid-19 pandemic onset. Finally, our research suggests that there is significant value for public health in considering the adoption of more sophisticated forecasting tools, moving beyond traditional naïve methods, and utilizing available software to enhance the precision and timeliness of norovirus surveillance in England.

Photo courtesy of YG Entertainment. K-zombies‘ treatment of serious social issues reveals how they can turn the apocalypse into entertainment. Influenza, an upcoming Coupang Play action horror thriller drama series starring Jisoo, will add to some of the best titles representing the genre—Train to Busan (2016)—that set the stage for more grisly on-screen zombie breakouts like Kingdom (2019), Peninsula (2020), Alive (2020), Happiness (2021), and All of Us Are Dead (2022). Soon after Jisoo acknowledged her presence in the show, it went abuzz, piquing interest and curiosity concerning the rest of the cast, which has also been reported to include Park Jung-min in a lead role alongside the K-pop superstar but is yet to be confirmed. Influenza is a crisis-ridden scenario that kicks off when people contract a weird contagious flu, turning them into zombies, and a struggle for survival in the face of impending horrific human extinction begins. The plot, based on Han Sang-woon’s novel of the same name, unfolds in a bustling Seoul tower amid an effort to control the mushrooming sickness. Lee Jae-yoon, undergoing conscription, is deployed there to serve in the defense unit. Meanwhile, his sweetheart, Kang Young-joo (Jisoo), writes him a letter urging a breakup. Mayhem hits as the flu-stricken individuals within the building start morphing into zombies. Jae-yoon and his colleagues, distraught as they are, must defend both themselves and others, for zombies are multiplying in the building, getting ghastlier by the minute. And circumstantially, against the flocking undead, Jae-hoon and Young-joo inadvertently reunite. Influenza is Jisoo’s sophomore K-drama project. She stated that the series will go into production shortly, and her role is very challenging in tandem with the narrative’s emphasis on frenetic action, profanity, hysteria, and horror. Jisoo previously starred with Jung Ha-in in the action-romance black comedy Snowdrop (2021). She played the role of Eun Yeong-ro, a college undergraduate who valiantly battles to shield injured North Korean agent Lim Soo-ho (Jung) from his assailants, tend to his wounds, and fall in love with him. Jisoo has also said that Influenza will necessitate her getting training to pull off its action. Its storyline and portrayal of events, I imagine, will stick out more since it features screenwriter Han Jin-won, best known for Parasite, which earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay at the 92nd Academy Awards in 2020. He shared it with director Bong Joon-ho, making them the first Asian writers to win at the Oscars for screenwriting.

(Lars Hagberg/The Canadian Press)Social SharingThere is a lot of COVID-19 circulating in Ontario right now, and levels of both that virus and influenza are on the rise, set to peak over the holiday season, the province's top doctor said Monday.This is a key week for immunizing against both viruses, Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore said, as it takes 10 to 14 days for protection to take effect."I want to acknowledge that many people are tired of COVID, but it's not tired of us," Moore said in an interview."Certainly we're seeing lots of COVID activity across Ontario. Our metrics for last week were that we had 1,700 people in hospital, around 100 of them requiring intensive care."That level is lower than at this time last year, but at that time COVID-19 activity was on a downswing, whereas now, it's on the rise, Moore said.About 1.8 million Ontarians have received the updated COVID-19 vaccine this fall, but that's just 13 per cent of the eligible population and 40 per cent of people over 65."Of the hospitalizations both for influenza and COVID, the risk is really associated with age the older that you are, the better protected we need you to be from those two infections through immunizations," he said."That leaves 60 per cent of our adults over 65 not protected at present and that's got me anxious as we head into the holiday season."Flu activity risingThe rate of people getting COVID-19 vaccinations peaked three weeks ago, he said.Flu activity is also on the rise, Moore said."It's anticipated, unlike last year, that influenza is following a more traditional pattern where it will be most active over the coming holiday and New Year's season, and so it'll be most transmissible in those social settings that are coming up," he said.HERE & NOW'What I want are recovery narratives': CBC Radio host Gill Deacon on life with long COVIDMore COVID cases are coming. Here's what you need to knowMoore does not intend to enact any public health measures."I think we'll just continue the risk communication and the measures that people can take in terms of layers of protection, and access to medications," he said.For COVID-19, there were 6,000 doses of Paxlovid dispensed last week, he said.System prepared for surge, Moore saysWhen it comes to the triple surge of COVID-19, the flu and respiratory syncytial virus that hit children hard last year and put pressure on children's hospitals, authorities have worked to ensure there won't be any shortages of children's Tylenol, Moore said."The system at large, I think, is prepared for this surge," he said."I do worry, though, as we head into influenza, that will be an extra burden on those hospitals."There are also more than 200 people in hospital with RSV, roughly half of them children four years old and under and half people over 65.Health Canada has approved an RSV vaccine for people aged 60 and older, but it is only available free of charge to people in that age group living in long-term care homes, Elder Care Lodges and retirement homes licensed to provide dementia care services.The out-of-pocket cost for the medication can be over $250.The government is looking at expanding public funding for the vaccine to alternative level of care patients in hospital — people who can be discharged to a long-term care home, for example, but don't yet have a spot — and/or dialysis patients, Moore said.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated StoriesHERE & NOW 'What I want are recovery narratives': CBC Radio host Gill Deacon on life with long COVID More COVID cases are coming.

The government is partially blaming the strikes as hospitals function at lower capacity.Health minister's office says public sector strikes are partly to blameErika Morris · CBC News · Posted: Dec 04, 2023 12:01 PM EST | Last Updated: December 4, 2023A rise in RSV, influenza and COVID-19 are overburdening already-struggling ERs in Quebec, physicians say. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)Social SharingPhysicians are warning that a surge in respiratory viruses is starting to clog up Quebec's emergency rooms and many of them are well above capacity.According to Amélie Boisclair, an intensive care internist at Pierre-Le Gardeur Hospital, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and COVID-19 are the main viruses currently circulating."It's no secret that emergency departments have been overflowing for some time now," she said."But now, we're really in the middle of the respiratory virus season, and you can see that people are coming in one after the other. Sometimes they're in such bad shape that they need intensive care."Matthew Oughton, an attending physician in the Jewish General Hospital's infectious diseases division, said it's normal to see an increase in influenza at the end of November and early December."Interestingly, Quebec, for whatever reason, we're one of the last areas of the country to be seeing influenza-A," he said. "That said, we're really barrelling into it."He also says COVID-19 cases are higher than they have been in the last 10 months.Judy Morris, head of the Quebec Association of Emergency Physicians, said crowded ERs are mostly the result of an overburdened health-care system."When you look at the numbers that we see, they're not that high compared to other years or other peaks. But the baseline capacity is not good. ERs are the tip of the iceberg," she said."Something has to be done so that the care of patients is adequate in the province."High occupancy ratesIn Lanaudière, the average ER occupancy rate was 167 per cent on Saturday evening, according to Index Santé. In the Laurentians, the average was 134 per cent, whilein the Montérégie, it was 129 per cent.The health minister's office said in a statement that the government is "trying to take pressure off our emergency rooms" by giving people who don't require immediate care other options, like calling 811.Quebec public sector workers begin 3-day strike, shuttering schools and hitting health careIt blamed public sector strikes for the worsening situation in emergency departments."These services operate at reduced capacity on strike days, which increases the pressure," the minister's office said in a statement."We are aware that the situation is far from ideal, we are monitoring it very closely and we will be taking stock of the situation in the next few days."ABOUT THE AUTHORErika MorrisFormer CBC journalistErika Morris was a journalist for CBC Montreal from 2021 to 2024.with files from Kwabena Oduro and Radio-CanadaCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Legault open to putting more money on table as 570,000 public workers strike RSV infections surge as hospitals brace for return of 'normal' respiratory virus season Health-care workers on edge as number of Albertans hospitalized with COVID-19 doublesFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Trends of the week: COVID-19: increase in the number of cases of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): slight increase in the number of RSV cases. Influenza: slight increase in the number of influenza cases. COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 From 27 November to 3 December 2023 (week 48), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 increased to 460 cases, compared to 319 cases the previous week (+44%). The positivity rate rose to 26% compared with 22% the previous week. The viral concentration detected in wastewater is increasing[1]. The latest sequencing data available show a preponderance of the EG.5.1 variant (31%) and the proportion of the BA.2.86 variant has increased to 6%. [2] Influenza For the week of 27 November to 3 December 2023 (week 48), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories increased to 49 cases compared to 41 cases in the previous week, an increase of 19% compared to the previous week. This data largely overlaps with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates increased circulation of rhinoviruses, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 in particular, but little circulation of influenza viruses [2]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 27 November to 3 December 2023 (week 48), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals detected by the laboratories rose to 116 cases, compared with 100 the previous week, presenting an increase of 16%.

(David Horemans/CBC)Social SharingFor the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020, Saskatchewan recorded more flu deaths than COVID-19 deaths during a two-week period.According to the latest report of the provincial Community Respiratory Illness Surveillance Program (CRISP), there were five deaths associated with the flu in the province from Nov. 19 to Dec. 2. During that same time period there were three deaths as a result of COVID-19. That brings the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the province since the pandemic began to 2,027.There have been 10 deaths from influenza since the flu season began this year. Hospitalizations for respiratory viruses dropped from the previous reporting period, according to the CRISP report. From Nov. 5 to Nov. 18, there were 633 hospitalizations as a result of respiratory viruses. Over the latest two-week period, there were 514 hospitalizations. Influenza accounts for 53 per cent of the hospitalizations while COVID-19 accounts for 34 per cent.

There are renewed calls for vaccination, particularly for people 80+. Seventeen more COVID deaths are reported locally. The latestSigns point to rising influenza rates in Ottawa as experts watch for the respiratory season to peak across the province.Flu trends have shifted from mostly low in recent Ottawa Public Health (OPH) updates to mostly high and rising.According to the latest numbers, most COVID-19 rates remain very high and are stable or rising. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity is also high.OPH says the city's health-care institutions remain at high risk from respiratory illnesses, as they have been since early September and are expected to remain until at least March.Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore said flu and COVID spread should peak in the next few weeks. Moore said the health-care system is prepared.In a news release, children's hospital CHEO said it's "much better equipped to manage this viral season" than it was last year, citing recent health-care spending by the province.There's less talk of a peak in Quebec.Physicians warn Quebec's ERs are over capacity as respiratory viruses increaseExperts recommend people cover coughs and sneezes, wear masks, keep their hands and often-touched surfaces clean, stay home when sick and keep up to date with COVID and flu vaccines to help protect themselves and other vulnerable people.This is a key week for immunizing against both viruses ahead of the end-of-year holidays, Moore said, as the vaccines require 10 to 14 days to take effect.WastewaterAs of Dec. 4, the average coronavirus wastewater level was still rising to its highest point since mid-January 2023. The daily reading on Saturday was the highest of the year.OPH considers this very high.Researchers have measured and shared the amount of novel coronavirus in Ottawa's wastewater since June 2020. This is the data from December 2022 to Dec. 4, 2023. (613covid.ca)HospitalsIn the past week, the average number of Ottawa residents in local hospitals for COVID-19 has fallen slightly to 71. It's been in and around the 70s for almost a month. That includes four patients in an ICU.A separate, wider count — which includes patients who tested positive for COVID after being admitted for other reasons, were admitted for lingering COVID complications or were transferred from other health units — is stable.Ottawa Public Health has a COVID-19 hospital count that shows all hospital patients who tested positive for COVID, including those admitted for other reasons and who live in other areas.

OPH sees this as a high number of new hospitalizations, though fewer than last week's 54.Tests, outbreaks, vaccines and deathsOttawa's weekly average test positivity rate has dropped to about 18 per cent. It has been around 20 per cent for the last month. OPH categorizes this as very high.There are 43 active COVID outbreaks — almost all are in either retirement homes or hospitals. The total is rising and there is a very high number of new outbreaks. The health unit reported 305 more COVID cases in the last week and four more COVID deaths: one person in their 70s, two in their 80s and one 90 or older.According to OPH's monthly COVID vaccination update, as of Nov. 27, 18 per cent of residents over age four had a dose in the previous six months, up from nine per cent at the end of October, just as the autumn vaccine campaign was revving up.This doesn't account for immunity from a recent infection.Ottawa Public Health shares when residents age 5 and up last had a COVID-19 vaccine. The percentage that had one in the last 6 months doubled in the last four weeks. (Ottawa Public Health)Nearly 100,000 doses have been administered in Ottawa over the last four weeks. The 28,400 doses given since Oct. 29 are the most in a single week since January 2022.Ottawa's Medical Officer of Health Dr. Vera Etches told CBC Radio's Ottawa Morning this week there's room to improve the vaccination share for people 80 and over because they account for about 65 per cent of the city's COVID deaths.Ottawa Morning10:16Ottawa Public Health winding down COVID-19 operationsThe board of health finalized its 2024 budget last night.

(Photo | AP)Namrata SindwaniUpdated on: 04 Dec 2023, 7:41 am2 min readCopiedBENGALURU : Even as China witnesses a spike in cases of respiratory diseases among children due to influenza and mycoplasma pneumonia, doctors in the city have assured that there is no alarming trend observed in Bengaluru.Chairman of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and HOD of Internal Medicine at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Dr K Ravi said, “We haven’t seen any major rise in pneumonia, influenza or SARI cases at any hospitals. There is no alarming trend as such, apart from a few regular cases.” Seasonal flu is infectious and spreads from person to person, and an infected person generally suffers from cold, dry cough and fever for at least 7 to 10 days, said Dr Ravi, and added that though viral pneumonia affects everyone, children are more prone to it.He explained that even mycoplasma pneumonia cases in China are causing breathlessness, fever or cough, and are bacteria-borne. Unlike viral pneumonia which might require patients to be hospitalised and takes longer to recover, most patients of the bacteria-borne pneumonia are not severely affected and are rarely hospitalised.According to the weekly infectious disease report of the State Surveillance Unit, Karnataka has reported 9,039 SARI cases and 3,417 influenza cases in 2023, (till November 26) both showing a downward trend. HoD of Paediatrics and Neonatology at Sakra World Hospital, Dr Rajath Athreya explained that there has been a continuous onset of viral-borne diseases including adenovirus, respiratory synctial virus (RSV) or flu-like cases in the last 6-8 months. He assured that no unprecedented seasonal spurt is expected in the city. Regular cases are being checked in OPDs.Being a TAC member, Dr Athreya also said the health department has initiated measures to tackle any rise in infections at the appropriate time as SARI cases are being well reported, and mock drills are also organised regularly in hospitals.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestKarnatakaPneumoniaShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

The authority said overall local influenza activity remains low, but the virus may pose a threat to the public health system at a later date. Dr Larry Lee, a chief manager with the authority, said hospitals would look into providing more beds and sending patients to units with lower demand. “No matter the influenza, mycoplasma or anything, I think cross-border spread will be a possibility to be a threat to Hong Kong’s healthcare system,” he said. “But we are prepared. We have multiple measures and try to avoid our healthcare system to be overwhelmed.” Dr Lee Kwok-piu from Eastern Hospital said more children are catching flu than in previous years, with the occupancy rate of paediatric units reaching 97 percent. “Perhaps in this particular year, we see more patients with multiple viruses attacking our children, not only influenza, but also other viruses such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus. That’s leading to persistently high occupancy rates in paediatrics,” he said. The authority said it will provide flu and Covid tests for patients who have symptoms.

These places include four Japanese prefectures - Saga, Ibaraki, Saitama and Kagoshima – as well as several regions in the United States, Canada, France, Belgium and Germany. In circulars to meat and egg traders dated Dec 8, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said the temporary restriction was imposed in light of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly called bird flu. “Heat-treated poultry products which comply with the World Organisation for Animal Health guidelines for inactivation of AI virus will not be subjected to the restriction,” stated the circular for Japanese imports. Heat-treated poultry refers to products that have been treated according to guidelines by the World Organisation for Animal Health. Bird flu, which has led to the culling of hundreds of millions of birds in the past years, usually strikes in Europe during autumn and winter. It was also recently detected on farms in Cambodia, Japan and South Korea. Japanese media NHK reported in November that the local government in Saga prefecture will cull about 40,000 birds on an affected farm. Related: France puts country on 'high' alert for bird flu Bird flu found on another German poultry farm: Authorities According to SFA’s data in 2022, Singapore approved 30 countries as sources of poultry which includes chicken, duck, turkey, goose and quail. Brazil, Malaysia and the United States are Singapore’s top sources of chicken. SFA said in a media statement earlier this year that as part of the accreditation, it assesses the countries to ensure that they have measures in place to make sure that the exported poultry, poultry products and eggs are free of high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI). “In addition, SFA monitors the outbreaks of HPAI worldwide and takes measures to suspend sources that have outbreaks of HPAI,” the agency added in a February statement on the global bird flu outbreak. “We suspend import from regions affected by HPAI or only allow products that have been heat treated to inactivate the HPAI virus.” SFA said Singapore poultry farms and slaughterhouses must also have biosecurity measures such as preventing wild birds from coming into contact with their poultry flocks. “SFA inspects local poultry farms and slaughterhouses, as well as test imported live poultry and poultry in local farms for avian influenza,” the agency stated on its website. World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said that the risk of transmission to humans is low. But as a precaution, people are advised not to touch dead or sick wild animals. To minimise the risk of contracting bird flu, SFA said consumers should cook poultry thoroughly. They should wash their hands with soap after handling raw poultry products. The agency added that people should also avoid contact with wild birds and live poultry when overseas.

Young children, in particular, are more likely than adults to be very sick from flu,” she said.“Vaccinating children protects them and their siblings, parents, grandparents and those who are vulnerable.”[ Winter period will feature more trolley waits and increased pressure, says HSE bossOpens in new window ]Flu can cause serious illness in children, Dr Keegan said. “The number of laboratory confirmed influenza-hospitalised cases in children aged 0-14 years for the 2022/2023 season was 1,274.”Children are given the nasal vaccine via a spray into each nostril, said the HSE, adding that it is pain-free.
