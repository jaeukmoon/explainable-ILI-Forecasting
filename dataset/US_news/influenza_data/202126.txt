The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with ICU admission and death in patients hospitalized with severe laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2017–2018 season in Catalonia. An observational epidemiological case-to-case study was carried out. Reported cases of severe laboratory-confirmed influenza requiring hospitalization in 2017–2018 influenza season were included. Mixed-effects regression analysis was used to estimate the factors associated with ICU admission and death. A total of 1306 cases of hospitalized severe influenza cases were included, of whom 175 (13.4%) died and 217 (16.6%) were ICU admitted. Age 65–74 years and ≥ 75 years and having ≥ 2 comorbidities were positively associated with death (aOR 3.19; 95%CI 1.19–8.50, aOR 6.95, 95%CI 2.76–1.80 and aOR 1.99; 95%CI 1.12–3.52, respectively). Neuraminidase inhibitor treatment and pneumonia were negatively associated with death. The 65–74 years and ≥ 75 years age groups were negatively associated with ICU admission (aOR 0.41; 95%CI 0.23–0.74 and aOR 0.30; 95%CI 0.17–0.53, respectively). A factor positively associated with ICU admission was neuraminidase inhibitor treatment. Our results support the need to investigate the worst outcomes of hospitalized severe cases, distinguishing between death and ICU admission.

Worldwide, annual epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths caused by respiratory conditions2. Most influenza infections are self-limiting, requiring no healthcare visits, but a proportion of cases present severe complications and require hospitalization and ICU admission.ICU admission and death have been considered as the worst outcomes for severe cases of influenza and sometimes only a category including those patients requiring ICU admission or who died is considered to identify the factors associated with severity3,4. However, because some differences have been found according to the outcome considered5,6, it seems reasonable to look at these different outcomes in a separate analysis.In the 1999–2000 season, a sentinel surveillance program of influenza and other viral diseases based on physicians of primary healthcare centers was initiated in Catalonia, a region in the northeast of Spain.In the 2010–2011 season, the surveillance of these diseases was improved by adding information about severe hospitalized influenza cases that were laboratory-confirmed provided by sentinel hospitals. In the 2017–2018 season there were 14 public hospitals, 13 attending adult and pediatric patients and one attending only pediatric patients. The hospitals participating in this sentinel system cover a population of 4,950,851, which represents 66.2% of the whole population7.In Catalonia, annual influenza vaccination is recommended to persons aged > 60 years, to pregnant women, and to patients with chronic medical conditions in whom influenza could have severe consequences. Antiviral treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) is administered only to hospitalized patients with severe presentation and to those in which individual assessment make it advisable because of high risk for severe complications8.Studies carried out in different geographical areas during the 2017–2018 influenza season showed increased severity in all age groups9,10,11,12,13. In Catalonia, according to the healthcare demand, the age-adjusted cumulative incidence rate in the 2017–2018 influenza season was 2295.26 per 100,000 habitants. Influenza B virus accounted for 63% of influenza viruses detected. The predominant lineage was Yamagata whereas the previous season was, with scarce circulation, Victoria lineage; H1N1 influenza A strains were similar to previous seasons, while a proportion of H3N2 influenza A circulating strains were different from the previous season. The difference in circulating influenza viruses, both AH3N2 and B, respect to the strains contained in the vaccine, could be responsible for a greater number of severe cases affecting specially the elderly14.The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with ICU admission and death in patients hospitalized with severe laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2017–2018 season.ResultsA total of 1306 cases of hospitalized severe influenza cases were included, 56.9% (743/1306) were male, the mean of age was 68.0 ± 20.7 and 34.3% (445/1299) had received the influenza vaccine. 518 were influenza A virus cases and 788 were influenza B virus cases; of the influenza A cases that were subtype, 101 were H1 and 80 were H3; no H5 was found. 175 patients (13.4%) died and 217 (16.6%) were admitted to the ICU (Fig. 1).Figure 1Flow chart of severe hospitalized influenza cases.Full size imageThere was no collinearity or interaction between variables.Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who died or survived are shown in Table 1. Age 65–74 and ≥ 75 years, having ≥ 2 comorbidities were positively associated with death and nosocomial infection (aOR 3.19; 95%CI 1.19–8.50, aOR 6.95, 95%CI 2.76–1.80, aOR 1.99; 95%CI 1.12–3.52 and aOR 1.91; 95%CI 1.16–3.17, respectively). NAI treatment, length of stay and pneumonia were negatively associated with death (aOR 0.23; 95%CI 0.14–0.38, aOR 0.51; 95%CI 0.35–0.74 and aOR 0.64; 95%CI 0.43–0.94, respectively). No coinfections with other influenza-type viruses were detected.Table 1 Factors associated with death in hospitalized severe influenza patients.Full size tableFactors associated with death according to patient groups are summarized in Fig. 2. The factors with the highest positive associations with death were chronic renal disease and chronic liver disease in the 50–64 years age group, chronic cardiovascular disease in the 65–74 years age group and having ≥ 2 comorbidities in the ≥ 75 years age group. Male sex was associated with death only in the 50–64 years age group.Figure 2Factors associated with death in hospitalized severe influenza patients according to age group, influenza type, patients admitted to ICU and patients with pneumonia. *Hemoglobinopathy, severe neuromuscular disease or cognitive dysfunction. COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, NAI: neuraminidase inhibitors.Full size imageIn influenza A virus cases, the factors positively associated with death were age ≥ 75 years and immune deficiency, while NAI treatment was negatively associated with death.In influenza B virus cases, factors positively associated with death were age ≥ 75 years, chronic liver disease, having ≥ 2 comorbidities and nosocomial infection. Length of stay and NAI treatment was negatively associated with death.In patients admitted to the ICU, the proportion of death was 24.9% (54/217) and factors positively associated with death were age ≥ 75 years, having ≥ 2 comorbidities and nosocomial infection.In patients who presented pneumonia, the proportion of death was 12.6% (105/831) and factors positively associated with death were ≥ 2 chronic medical conditions, age ≥ 75 years, chronic liver disease and nosocomial infection. Length of stay and NAI treatment was negatively associated with death.The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients admitted to the ICU or not are shown in Table 2. Age < 15 years, 65–74 years or ≥ 75 years were negatively associated with ICU admission (aOR 0.29; 95%CI 0.11–0.76, aOR 0.41; 95%CI 0.23–0.74 and aOR 0.30; 95%CI 0.17–0.53, respectively) as was pneumonia (aOR 0.61; 95%CI 0.41–0.89). NAI treatment and length of stay was positively associated with ICU admission (aOR 2.12; 95%CI 1.19–4.13 and aOR 6.54; 95%CI 4.17–10.24, respectively).Table 2 Factors associated with ICU admission in hospitalized severe influenza patients.Full size tableFactors associated with ICU admission according to patient subgroup are summarized in Fig. 3.

NAI: neuraminidase inhibitors.Full size imageIn influenza A virus cases, factors associated positively with ICU admission were morbid obesity and chronic liver disease. Factors negatively associated with ICU admission were the < 15 years and ≥ 75 years age groups.In influenza B virus cases, factors negatively associated were the 65–74 years and ≥ 75 years age groups.In patients with pneumonia, length of stay and NAI treatment was associated positively with ICU admission and factors negatively associated with ICU admission were the < 15 years, 65–74 years and ≥ 75 years age groups.DiscussionThe results of this study show that the proportion of death in hospitalized severe influenza cases was 13.4%, lower than the 18.8% found by Liu et al.15 in the 2016–2018 season in severe patients in Taiwan, but higher than the 9.2% found by Kolosova et al.16 in Russia in hospitalized severe patients in the 2017–2018 season, the 6.5% found in all hospitalized patients in China in the same 2017–2018 season10, and the 5.5% found by Natheglian et al. in hospitalized severe patients during 2015–2018 in Iran12.The risk of death increased in the 65–74 years and ≥ 75 years age groups, coinciding with the findings of most studies reviewed12,17,18,19,20,21,22,23, although some authors found no differences in mortality according to age24.Among the factors investigated, COPD was associated with death in the 15–49 years age group, coinciding with the results found by Walker et al. in a study carried out in New Zealand between 2012 and 2015 where the outcome did not distinguish between death and ICU admission25. Immunodeficiency was associated with death in the 15–49 years age group in influenza A and B virus cases and in all age groups in influenza A virus cases, and although we do not have the precise information, the association in the first age group was probably was associated with HIV infection, which has been described as a factor of severity for influenza1, especially for influenza A cases26,27. Czaja et al.28 in the United States during the 2010–2011 to 2014–2015 seasons found that, in hospitalized influenza cases, immunosuppression was also associated with death or transfer to a hospice.Male sex was only associated with death in the 50–64 years age group. Some authors have found male sex was associated with a higher risk of death12 but, coinciding with our results, Lina et al. in the United States in the 2017–2018 season found that the death was more frequent in males than females in the 50–64 years age group29. Zou et al.13 in a study carried out in influenza-related cases in China in the 2017–2018 season found an association between male sex and death in patients with influenza-related pneumonia, but we did not.As reported by other authors10,25,26,30, we found that chronic renal disease was associated with death, but only in the 50–64 years age group.Nosocomial infection was associated with death. A study carried out in France in 2016–2017 season also found that nosocomial influenza was associated with mortality31.Having received seasonal influenza vaccine was associated with a higher risk of death in the crude analysis but not in the adjusted analysis. This finding could be explained because vaccinated could attend to the hospital more frequently than do unvaccinated subjects as suggested by Casado et al.32 in a study carried out in older adults in 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 season. However, residual confounding by comorbid conditions could not be ruled out as suggested by other authors33 because patients with comorbidities (79% in our study) are more likely to access healthcare resources and subsequently have more opportunities to receive the influenza vaccine. On the other hand, as suggested by Gutiérrez-González et al.17 because only hospitalized severe cases are included in the study, the protection for fatal episodes might be underestimated.We should also highlight that influenza B virus was the most prevalent in the 2017–2018 influenza season in Catalonia and that the effectiveness of vaccination was only 14% (95%CI 0–47) against influenza B virus cases because the circulating lineage Yamagata was not included in vaccines used14.NAI treatment was a preventive factor against death in all patients considered globally, in the age groups studied, and in influenza A and B virus cases, as other authors have reported20. However, some authors34,35 found no association between NAI treatment and death. Groenveld et al., in a study carried out in the Netherlands in the 2013–2016 seasons, found that NAI did not avoid death during the hospital stay but did avoid a composite endpoint including 30-day mortality and ICU admission36.In patients with pneumonia, we also found that NAI treatment was a protective factor against death, without differences according to the influenza virus type. Chen et al., in a study carried out in influenza A-related pneumonia cases in China from 2013 to 2018, found that early NAI treatment was protective against death37 and that protection was higher in influenza B-related pneumonia cases38. Zou et al. found no association between NAI treatment and death and proposed that a double dose of oseltamivir should be administered in patients with pneumonia13.The proportion of hospitalized severe influenza cases admitted to the ICU was 16.6% (17.8% for influenza A cases and 15.9% for influenza B cases), figures close to the 15.4% (23% for influenza A cases and 12.7% for influenza B cases) obtained by Stahl et al.39 in Germany in the same influenza season, and the 13.4% for influenza A cases and 17.8% for influenza B cases obtained by Assaf-Casals et al.24 in Lebanon during 2008–2016. Other authors studying severe patients have found higher figures29, but the differences in criteria for hospitalization might, at least in part, explain the differences.The highest proportion of ICU admission was found in the 50–64 years age group, and declined thereafter, with the lowest proportion (10.4%) in the ≥ 75 years age group. This finding was also observed by Oliva et al. in a study carried out in hospitalized severe cases in Spain in the 2010–2011 to 2015–2016 seasons, who found that the 15–64 years age group had the highest proportion of ICU admission19. Beumer et al. found differences in ICU admission according to age: the highest proportion was in the 50–65 years age group and the proportion fell in patients aged ≥ 65 years30. A French study by Pivette et al. in 2012–2017 also found a reduction in ICU admissions in elderly patients with influenza40.Mazagatos et al.41 in a Spanish study carried out in the 2010–2011 to 2015–2016 seasons found that 38.9% of hospitalized pregnant women who presented severe influenza were admitted to the ICU, but only 7 pregnant women were included in our study with 2 (29%) requiring ICU admission, and therefore this finding cannot be evaluated. In a systematic review by Mertz et al.23 pregnancy as a risk factor was not well studied because of the 56 studies included in the revision only one study having data on this. Coinciding with Walker et al.25, ICU admission was associated with cardiovascular disease in patients aged 65–74 years. Our results and those of Beumer et al. in a study carried out in 2015–2016 in the Netherlands also show a positive association between cardiovascular disease and the risk of ICU admission30.We found that morbid obesity was not associated with ICU admission or death, these findings were also observed by Atamna el al. in the study carried out in Israel in 2017–2018 season42. In contrast with the results found by Segaloff et al. in a study carried out in Michigan in seasons 2012–2012 and 2012–2013 in adults43. Chronic vascular disease in the 65–74 years age group and morbid obesity in influenza A cases were associated with ICU admission, in contrast to Beumer et al., who found no association with obesity30.ICU admission was required in 18.1% of patients with influenza-related pneumonia, lower than the 22.4% obtained in Chinese studies by Chen et al. during 2013–201944 and Zou et al. in the 2027–2018 season13. As in all patients considered globally, we found that in patients with pneumonia ICU admission was negatively associated with older age.When death was the considered outcome, NAI treatment, whether administered in the first 48 h after symptom onset or > 48 h after symptom onset had a protective effect. However, NAI treatment administered > 48 h after symptom onset was associated with ICU admission, a result found in a previous study of including six influenza seasons45; this might be because the severity of patients candidates for ICU admission are treated with NAI if they had not been treated before.Influenza causes a range of outcomes in children, including severe disease, ICU admission and death3,9. The case fatality rates of influenza in children range between 0 and 4.9%6. In the present study, no deaths were registered in children and no differences in the severity, measured as ICU admission, was found between influenza A and B viruses, coinciding with the findings of other authors46,47.This study, like all observational studies, has strengths and limitations. The main strength is that there are few studies comparing specific outcomes of severity (death on the one hand and ICU admission on the other) and, therefore, our results may help to identify differences between the two outcomes. Another strength is that all cases were laboratory-confirmed and, therefore, the distribution of independent variables corresponded to real severe influenza cases.The first limitation is that hospitals participated voluntarily, which could lead to selection bias. However, because the hospitals participating in the surveillance system of severe cases cover more than 66% of the Catalan population, the proportion of patients living in municipalities of ≤ 10,000 inhabitants is 12.8%, similar to the total of Catalonia, where the proportion of the population living in municipalities of ≤ 10,000 inhabitants is 18.5% and we used a mixed-effect logistic regression model with hospitals as a random intercept, we believe the results maybe extensible to hospitalized severe cases in Catalonia. Another limitation is that we only studied one influenza season, when the inclusion of several seasons is recommended due to differences in circulating types and subtypes from one season to another. However, because the 2017–2018 influenza season showed high severity, determining the outcomes of severity in this specific season may be interest. A third limitation is that the small number of pregnant women and children did not permit any conclusions about these two key risk groups for influenza severity.The final adjusted model was constructed taking into account the propensity score built with variables that included the most important comorbidities, and it seems unlikely that the results suffered a large bias. Nevertheless, some residual confounding cannot be ruled out.In conclusion, our results support the need to investigate the worst outcomes in hospitalized severe cases of influenza, distinguishing between death and ICU admission. We found that older age was a risk factor for death but was negatively associated with ICU admission. By contrast, while NAI treatment both before and after 48 h of symptom onset prevented death, NAI treatment ≥ 48 h after symptom onset was more frequent in patients admitted to the ICU, probably reflecting medical attitudes to patients requiring ICU admission.Material and methodsStudy designAn observational, epidemiological case-to-case study was carried out in patients hospitalized due to severe acute influenza infection. A severe case of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was defined as a case requiring hospitalization due to pneumonia, septic shock, multi-organ failure, acute respiratory distress, death or any other severe condition including ICU admission, or who developed these clinical signs during hospitalization for other reasons8. The diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR and/or culture on nasopharyngeal swab samples.Respiratory tract samples were processed at each hospital laboratory within 24 h of receipt. A 300 μl aliquot was taken for total nucleic acid extraction and eluted in 25 μl of RNase-free elution buffer using the automatic QIAsymphony system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, two specific one-step multiplex real-time PCR using Stratagene Mx3000P QPCR Systems (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were carried out for typing A/B influenza virus (sensitivity was 10 and 103 copies/μl, respectively) and subtyping influenza A virus (sensitivity was 102, 103 and 10 copies/μl for H1, H3 and H5 RNA, respectively)48. For H1 positive detections to identify H1N1pdm09, specific in-house primers were used.Data collectedReported cases of severe laboratory-confirmed influenza requiring hospitalization in the 2017–2018 influenza season were included.For each reported case, trained interviewer collected the following variables: demographic data (age, sex, size of municipally), medical conditions (COPD, morbid obesity [BMI > 40 kg/m2 to classify obesity for adults and for children obesity is defined as a BMI at or above the 95th percentile for children and teens of the same age and sex], diabetes, chronic renal disease, immune deficiency [HIV infection or other], chronic cardiovascular disease, chronic liver disease, hemoglobinopathy, severe neuromuscular disease or cognitive dysfunction), and clinical data (date of symptom onset, type of virus [A or B], pneumonia, seasonal influenza vaccination status, antiviral treatment with NAI and its date, ICU admission and in-hospital mortality). Cases were considered vaccinated if they had received a dose of influenza vaccine ≥ 14 days before symptom onset. The primary source of information was the medical record.Statistical analysisWe assessed the associations between death or UCI admission and the independent variables (sociodemographic variables, virus type and clinical characteristics). Possible interactions between independent variables were analyzed by logistic regression. Independent variables were checked for collinearity using the variance inflation factor.Crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were constructed using a mixed-effects logistic regression model with the variable hospital as a random intercept. Adjusted OR (aOR) were calculated using propensity scores, which were estimated by logistic regression with age, sex, comorbidities, pneumonia, seasonal influenza vaccination, type of virus and NAI treatment as independent variables. The propensity score was used as a continuous covariate in the mixed-effects logistic regression model.The analysis was performed using the SPSS v.25 statistical package and R v3.5.0 statistical software (http://cran.r-project.org).Ethical considerationsData used in the analysis were collected under routine public health surveillance activities as part of the legislated mandate of the Health Department of Catalonia, the competent authority for the surveillance of communicable diseases, which is officially authorized to receive, treat and temporally store personal data on cases of infectious diseases49. All data were fully anonymized. All study activities formed part of public surveillance and were thus exempt from institutional board review of Health Department of Government of Catalonia and did not require informed consent.

View: Text | PDF Research Article Infectious disease Vaccines Influenza vaccination in the elderly boosts antibodies against conserved viral proteins and egg-produced glycans Text PDF Abstract Seasonal influenza vaccination elicits a diminished adaptive immune response in the elderly, and the mechanisms of immunosenescence are not fully understood. Using Ig-Seq, we found a marked increase with age in the prevalence of cross-reactive (CR) serum antibodies that recognize both the H1N1 (vaccine-H1) and H3N2 (vaccine-H3) components of an egg-produced split influenza vaccine. CR antibodies accounted for 73% ± 18% of the serum vaccine responses in a cohort of elderly donors, 65% ± 15% in late middle-aged donors, and only 13% ± 5% in persons under 35 years of age. The antibody response to non-HA antigens was boosted by vaccination. Recombinant expression of 19 vaccine-H1+H3 CR serum monoclonal antibodies (s-mAbs) revealed that they predominantly bound to non-HA influenza proteins. A sizable fraction of vaccine-H1+H3 CR s-mAbs recognized with high affinity the sulfated glycans, in particular sulfated type 2 N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1-4GalNAcβ), which is found on egg-produced proteins and thus unlikely to contribute to protection against influenza infection in humans. Antibodies against sulfated glycans in egg-produced vaccine had been identified in animals but were not previously characterized in humans. Collectively, our results provide a quantitative basis for how repeated exposure to split influenza vaccine correlates with unintended focusing of serum antibody responses to non-HA antigens that may result in suboptimal immunity against influenza.

We investigated the relationship between cellular immunity and the antibody response to inactivated influenza vaccines.Methods: 25 patients (age: 2-18 years) undergoing chemotherapy for different malignancies participated in our study. Flow cytometric detection of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations together with hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers were measured before and 21-28 days after vaccination. We examined the ratio and total numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, activated helper (CD3+CD4+CD25low), regulatory (CD3+CD4+CD25high), naive (CD3+CD45RA+) and memory (CD3+CD45RO+) T cells, CD56+NK, and CD3+CD56+ (NKT-like) cells. Relationships between specific antibody responses (seroprotection, seroconversion, geometric mean titer (GMT), geometric mean fold increase (GMFI)) and the ratios and counts of lymphocyte subpopulations were evaluated using one-way ANOVA and the paired sample t test after dichotomization according to age-related reference values.Results: Patients with CD4+ lymphocyte levels in the normal age-specific range showed significantly better response regarding postvaccination GMT elevation for H1N1 and H3N2 strains (97.52 vs. 19.2, p=0.019, 80 vs. 14.43, p=0.021, respectively). GMFI results were significant only against B strain (2.69-fold vs. 1.23-fold, p=0.046). Prevaccination CD3+CD56+ (NKT-like) cells above predicted values according to age showed significant associations both in postvaccination GMT elevation (H1N1: 75.11 vs. 14.14, p=0.010; H3N2: 62.18 vs. 11.22, p=0.012; B: 22.69 vs. 6.67, p=0.043) and GMFI against all three strains (H1N1: 3.76-fold vs. 1.06-fold, p=0.015; H3N2: 2.74-fold vs. 1, p=0.013; B: 2.57-fold vs. 1, p=0.008). By one-way ANOVA, we found a positive relation between absolute lymphocyte cell count above 1000/µl and the postvaccination GMT elevation against H3N2 (12.81 vs. 56.56, p=0.032), and GMFI regarding H1N1 (1.22-fold vs. 3.48-fold, p=0.044).Conclusions: In addition to verifying the predictive value of absolute lymphocyte count above 1000/µl, our results suggest an association between NKT-like cell counts and the specific antibody response against all three investigated influenza strains in highly immunosuppressed patients. Furthermore, prevaccination CD4+ lymphocyte levels in the normal age-specific range may influence seroresponse.IntroductionChemotherapy induced cytopenias cause prolonged immunosuppression in patients with malignancies resulting in increased susceptibility for pathogens. An annually recurring potential risk is infection with influenza. It can cause severe illness and complications as well as delays in treatment regimens thus threatening the outcome of cancer treatment (1, 2). The recommended vaccination offers the possibility to prevent infection and its complications (3).Furthermore, investigating the immune response and factors that might be associated with successful immunization of such an immunocompromised population gives us a unique opportunity to evaluate the underlying immunological mechanisms and find targets for vaccine improvement.In a previous study we evaluated the immune response and safety of concomitant trivalent-inactivated vaccine for seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2 and B), and monovalent-inactivated vaccine for the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus in children undergoing chemotherapy (4). In agreement with several other studies (5–9), we verified that a higher baseline absolute lymphocyte count may enhance the immune response to influenza vaccination. A remaining question is which specific lymphocyte subpopulation could be responsible for this enhancement.In recent years cellular, especially T cell responses gained increasing importance in influenza vaccine research and development (10–12). One such area of ongoing research are natural killer (NK) T cells, also called as NKT-like cells, a heterogeneous group of T lymphocytes that confer natural immunity. These cells have the phenotypic characteristics of both T cells and NK cells and function as a link between innate and adaptive immunity. NKT-like cells include a wide group of innate T lymphocyte populations, such as γδT cells, and CD1- and MR-1-restricted T cells which have an important immunoregulatory function. Unlike the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells, these cells possess a restricted repertoire of T cell receptors, perform rapid effector responses and recognize a limited selection of non-peptide molecules, presented by the MHC class I-like molecule CD1d. Upon activation, NKT cells rapidly release large quantities of multiple cytokines and chemokines capable of boosting adaptive immune responses. They are capable of stimulating a wide array of immune cells that enhance vaccine-mediated immune responses (13).Induction of NKT cells with a special adjuvant has resulted in improved immune responses in several animal models (14) of influenza vaccination. NKT cells show similarity in mammals so induction of these cells during vaccination might be promising in humans as well. Furthermore, based on animal investigations, some authors suggest that NKT cell induction might have a role also in the treatment of influenza infection (15).Every finding in humans that correlates with results of animal investigations supports a similar role of NKT cells in humans and leads us closer to improved prevention or treatment of influenza virus infection.In our study we investigated the relationship between cellular immunity and the response to influenza vaccines in children receiving chemotherapy with different types of malignancies.Materials and MethodsPatient CharacteristicsTwenty-five consecutively treated patients (11 males and 14 females) were enrolled in our study during the influenza season periods of 2016/2017 and 2017/2018. Median age was 6 years (range 2 to 18 years). The underlying diseases were hematologic malignancies in the majority of participants (19 patients), while the remaining 6 cases had various solid tumors. All patients had been receiving chemotherapy at the Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology of the University of Pécs within 1 month before vaccination, and all continued to receive scheduled chemotherapy afterwards. Nine patients were undergoing maintenance therapy and sixteen children were receiving intensive cytostatic treatment (Table 1).TABLE 1 Table 1 Patient characteristics.Exclusion criteria were the following: recent history of influenza vaccination, confirmed influenza infection prior to vaccination, history of egg allergy, administration of other vaccines during the study period. One patient was eventually excluded from the study due to lack of adherence to follow-up visits.Study Design, Vaccine and ScheduleThe protocol for vaccination was designed in accordance with the recommendations of the Infectology Department of the Hungarian National Healthcare Advisory Board, based on data received from the Hungarian National Center of Epidemiology (16, 17).The Institutional Review Board of the University of Pécs authorized the protocol for this study (3672.316-2954/2010). Sample collections were performed concurrently with the routine blood sampling involved in cancer treatment. Written consent was obtained from the parents of each child.In both seasons, a whole-virion, trivalent, inactivated, adjuvanted influenza vaccine (3Fluart - Fluart Innovative Vaccines Ltd., Budapest, Hungary) was in use for vaccination. Each preparation contained aluminium phosphate gel adjuvant and 6 µg haemagglutinin of each strain per 0.5 ml. Strains were selected according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization for the northern hemisphere for influenza vaccine composition for respective seasons: A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like, B/Brisbane/60/2008-like, A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like (A/California/7/2009, NYMC X-181) in 2016/2017 and A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like in 2017/2018.Fifteen patients were younger than 10 years old, and therefore received 0.25 ml of the vaccine, while ten participants received 0.5 ml of the vaccine.In patients receiving maintenance treatment, vaccine was given without discontinuation of therapy. During intensive treatment, vaccination was scheduled in all patients 2-3 days before the next cytostatic treatment according to the recommendations of the Hungarian National Healthcare Advisory Board.Sample Collection and Serological AnalysisBlood samples were taken from each participant before vaccination and 28 days afterwards, mostly via central venous catheter for measurements of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer, immunoglobulin level, white blood cell count and flow cytometric analysis.Three millilitres of serum were separated by centrifugation, then immediately frozen and stored at -80°C until the laboratory measurements on HI antibody titers were performed. Titers against the virus strains were measured by hemagglutination inhibition with chicken red blood cells following recommended procedures (18). All serologic tests were done at a single central laboratory (Department of Virology, National Center of Epidemiology, Budapest, Hungary). Each pair of sera were tested in complete duplicate series on the same day with the use of identical reagents.The geometric mean HI antibody titer (GMT), seroprotection (defined as a titer level of ≥1:40) rate, seroconversion (defined a ≥4-fold increase in titer from baseline or a postvaccination titer level of ≥1:40 if the baseline titer was undetectable) rate, and GMT fold increase (GMFI: GMT ratio of postvaccination titer to prevaccination titer) were calculated.Multiparametric Flow Cytometry Analysis of PhenotypesThe following anti-human monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD8-PE, anti-CD4-PerCP, anti-CD56-PECy5, anti-CD25-PE, anti-CD45RA-PE and anti-CD45RO-PerCP (all from BD Biosciences). The 50 µl blood sample (EDTA) was incubated with the appropriate antibody cocktails for 30 minutes on ice, washed twice in phosphate buffered saline and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde prior flow cytometric analysis using a FACSCalibur cytometer with CellQuestPro software. At least 10,000 cells were collected in the lymphocyte gate and analyzed. CD3+, CD4+, CD5+, CD8+ T cells, CD3+CD4+CD25- “resting Thelper cells”, CD3+CD4+CD25low “activated” and, CD3+CD4+CD25high “regulatory” T cells were detected and their absolute cell numbers were calculated. We followed naive CD3+CD45RA+ and CD3+CD45RO+ memory T cell percentages and absolute cell counts, CD3+CD56+ NKT-like and CD56+ NK cell ratio and absolute cell counts. CD3/CD45 positive cells were further analyzed for their CD4, CD8 and CD25 expression. Naive and memory T cells were detected with simultaneous CD3/CD45RA/CD45RO staining, NK cells and NKT cells were analyzed from the lymphocyte gate based on their CD3/CD56 positivity. For each of the gated cell populations the percentages of cells were analyzed. Gating strategies are presented in Figure 1.FIGURE 1 Figure 1 Gating strategies. At least 10,000 cells were collected in the lymphocyte gate and analyzed. CD3+, CD4+, CD5+, CD8+ T cells, CD3+CD4+CD25- “resting Thelper cells”, CD3+CD4+CD25low “activated” and, CD3+CD4+CD25high “regulatory” T cells were detected and their absolute cell numbers were calculated. We followed naive CD3+CD45RA+ and CD3+CD45RO+ memory T cell percentages and absolute cell counts, CD3+CD56+ NKT-like and CD56+ NK cell ratio and absolute cell counts. CD3/CD45 positive cells were further analyzed for their CD4, CD8 and CD25 expression. Naive and memory T cells were detected with simultaneous CD3/CD45RA/CD45RO staining, NK cells and NKT cells were analyzed from the lymphocyte gate based on their CD3/CD56 positivity. For each of the gated cell populations the percentages of cells were analyzed.Adverse Reactions and Medical ConditionsBaseline assessments on day 0 consisted of gathering demographic data, medical history and physical examination. We examined each patient on a weekly basis by physical and laboratory (complete blood count) examination during the follow-up period, until the final blood sampling was obtained for serologic study. Possible vaccine-related adverse events were monitored closely. On follow-up visits, standard medical history and medications administered since the last visit were summarized, and physical examination was performed prior to blood sample collection. Safety variables were recorded during follow-up visits for patient history and physical examination.Statistical AnalysisData were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and paired sample t test using the package SPSS 20.0. F-tests for main effects were obtained using one-way ANOVA (weighted method). For one-way ANOVA analyses we divided our sample of patients into two groups based on age-related reference values and where these were not available, statistically determined cut-off values for each cellular parameter to investigate whether a certain cell count or ratio might be related to better serologic response.We handled pre- and postvaccination HI titers in two ways.We analyzed GMT levels at pre- and postvaccination: due to skewed distributions, analyses were performed on the natural log of HI titer and arithmetic means were converted to GMT with exponential transformation.We calculated values of GMFI between pre- and postvaccination: as it was discussed earlier (19) that in a population which is not entirely seronegative before immunization, prevaccination HI titer levels have significant influence on postvaccination titers, we examined the ratio of post-/prevaccination GMTs.Due to the methodology of serologic analyses, negative specimens (undetectable titer levels) were assigned a nominal value of 5 for the purposes of statistical analysis. For each test, a p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.We analyzed day 0 results for the following parameters: absolute lymphocyte count, total CD3+ T, CD4+ Th and CD8+ Tc cell count, CD4/CD8 ratio, CD3+CD45RA+ naive and CD3+CD45RO+ memory T cell count and naive/memory T cell ratio. Furthermore, we followed Treg cell (CD3+CD4+CD25High) and activated Thelper (CD3+CD4+CD25Low) cell counts, CD3+CD4+CD25High/Low ratio, CD3+CD56+ NKT-like and CD56+ NK cell counts; and compared them with postvaccination HI titers (postvaccination GMT) or with the GMFI between day 0 and day 28. We conducted these studies (postvaccination GMT and GMFI) separately for each virus strain: H1N1pdm09-like, H3N2-like and B/Brisbane strain.ResultsAntibody ResponsesGMTs, seroprotection and seroconversion rates were calculated on day 0 and on day 28. GMTs of antibodies to different influenza virus strains are listed in Table 2. All postvaccination GMTs were higher than prevaccination GMTs, regarding H1N1, H3N2 and B/Brisbane strains, and examining GMFI, increases between them were significant. Seroprotection and seroconversion rates according to virus strains are shown in Table 3.TABLE 2 Table 2 GMT and GMFI values on day 0 (prevaccination) and day 21-28 (postvaccination) according to virus strains.TABLE 3 Table 3 Pre- and postvaccination rates for seroprotection† and seroconversion‡ by virus strains.Flow Cytometry Results According to Age-Related Reference ValuesAccording to the age-matched reference intervals provided by Huenecke et al. (20) we observed that in most cases, total lymphocyte count, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ counts were under the lower limit of age-related intervals. CD4/CD8 ratio was within the normal range in 52% of our patients. Interestingly, percentages of CD3CD25+ activated T cells and CD4CD25+ activated Th cells were in normal ranges in all of our patients. For certain subpopulations however, no age-dependent reference ranges were available. Since intervals were not available for CD3+CD56+ NKT cells, we used the predicted values and found that 50% of our patients had results under this cut-off value. Descriptive results are summarized in Table 4.TABLE 4 Table 4 Flow cytometry results describing the baseline cellular parameters (absolute counts and percentages) compared to age-related normal values.Relationship of Lymphocyte Subpopulations and the Immune ResponseSupplementary Table 1. shows the absolute cell numbers and percentages analyzed using flow cytometry and the ratios of certain cells. By assessing specific cell population counts, we examined the relations between lymphocyte subpopulations and their ratios and the outcome of vaccination. The associations of prevaccination T cells and GMT and GMFI by different strains is shown in Tables 5 and 6. As mentioned before, a p-value < 0.05 was considered significant for each test.TABLE 5 Table 5 Relations between different prevaccination cellular parameters and postvaccination GMT by virus strains. Significant results are written in bold.TABLE 6 Table 6 Relations between different prevaccination cellular parameters and GMFI by virus strains. Significant results are written in bold.By one-way ANOVA, we did not find a relation between age-related baseline absolute lymphocyte counts and postvaccination GMT and GMFI against the three influenza strains. However, after comparing the immune response of patients with absolute lymphocyte cell counts below or above 1000/µl, these results suggested a positive association between higher cell counts and vaccine response. We found a positive relation with the postvaccination GMT elevation against H3N2 (12.81 vs. 56.56), and GMFI regarding H1N1 (1.22-fold vs. 3.48-fold).Regarding CD4+ lymphocytes, we expected better immune responses in patients with CD4+ cell counts in the normal age-specific range and they showed significantly better results in postvaccination GMT elevation for H1N1 and H3N2 strains (97.52 vs. 19.2 and 80 vs. 14.43, respectively). However, GMFI results were significant only against B strain.Analyses of age-related predicted values of CD3+CD56+ cells showed significant relations both with postvaccination GMT elevation and GMFI against all three strains. Patients with CD3+CD56+ counts above the predicted threshold had better responses in GMT after vaccination (H1N1: 75.11 vs. 14.14; H3N2: 62.18 vs. 11.22; B: 22.69 vs. 6.67). GMFI results were significant regarding all strains as well (H1N1: 3.76-fold vs. 1.06-fold, H3N2: 2.74-fold vs. 1, B: 2.57-fold vs. 1).Considering that age-specific references were not available for all measured cellular parameters, we tried to establish cut-off values based on statistical methods.We compared the role of Treg cells and found that the ratio of regulatory/activated T cells (CD3+CD4+CD25High vs. CD3+CD4+CD25Low) above 10% suggested a negative association with postvaccination GMT results in H3N2 strain (42.02 vs. 10.72, respectively). Patients with an absolute Treg (CD3+CD4+CD25High) cell count <10/µl showed a tendency to have higher GMFI (2.46-fold vs. 1.16-fold) against H3N2 strain. The activated T cell (CD3+CD4+CD25Low) count did not show relations with postvaccination GMT or GMFI with any of the strains.Analyses of CD4/CD8 ratio, CD3+CD45RA+ naive and CD3+CD45RO+ memory T cell counts, naive/memory T cell ratio, CD3+, CD8+, and CD56+ NK cell counts did not show significant associations with immune response against any of the strains.Adverse ReactionsWe recorded no local adverse reactions (injection site induration, erythema, swelling or warmth). No medical intervention was necessary. No vaccine related serious adverse event was observed. There were no breakthrough influenza infections.DiscussionMyelosuppressive effects of therapeutic protocols are considerably diverse depending on the underlying malignancy and the cytotoxic agents administered. In hematological malignancies immunosuppressive effects persist during treatment and recovery can take more than 12 months after cessation of therapy. Acute lymphocytic leukemia patients have decreased lymphocyte counts in all major groups compromising both humoral and cellular immunity possibly affecting preexisting humoral protection resulting from childhood vaccinations or previous infections. Total leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were found to be comparable to healthy children after 1 year (21). However, flow cytometry investigations demonstrated that recovery of specific subsets might take much longer (22), CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ cells were affected most (23–25). Recovery of naive T cells to age-related normal levels was found to take 1-6 months (22, 26), which can be explained by the ability of the thymus to produce new naive cells in childhood.CD4+ cell counts were found to be persistently low in a long term investigation of pediatric ALL patients, with decreases both in CD3+CD45RO and CD3+CD45RA subsets (21, 26). Significant decrease in the ratio of CD4+ and CD8+ cells was reported in multiple studies during and after chemotherapy treatment (27). NK cells did not show significant differences after different time points of treatment completion (21).Solid tumor patients show much faster reconstitution of immune status. Lower immunoglobulin levels mostly recovered within the first six months. Severely decreased CD4+ T cell count resulting in lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio, persisted briefly after therapy compared to leukemia patients. Total T lymphocytes recovered within six to twelve months (28, 29). NK cells were found to be increased immediately after treatment and normalized within 6 months (28).As we expected, our patients had markedly lower cell counts in most measured subpopulations so we anticipated a modest immune response against influenza vaccination. A recently published multicenter immunogenicity trial with a trivalent influenza vaccine of the same manufacturer and composition as the one used in our study gave us the opportunity to compare our results to healthy children. In two age groups (3-11 years and 12-18 years) postvaccination seroprotection rates varied between 80-96.67% and seroconversion rates were between 58.33-70% (30). Although in our group of patients, postvaccination GMTs were significantly higher than prevaccination values against all three strains, considerably worse seroconversion and seroprotection results were consistent with reports in immunocompromised populations.Based on our previous results (4) and other reports on the predictive value of baseline lymphocyte counts (5, 8), we expected a positive association between the absolute lymphocyte count above 1000/µl on day 0 and HI titer changes independent of virus strains. We could reconfirm these results against H3N2 in GMT and H1N1 and B in GMFI. Analyses based on age-related normal values did not show significant associations with vaccine response.We expected to find a positive relation between higher CD4+ (Thelper) cell counts and the serosresponse. In healthy adults, the predictive role of absolute CD4+ T cell count has already been reported. Jürchott et al. (31) found that CD4+ T cell count along with other factors could predict seroprotection against pandemic influenza strain (A(H1N1)pdm09) with 89% accuracy. We found that baseline absolute CD4+ T cell count within the age-related interval showed a positive relation with both postvaccination GMT (H1N1, H3N2) and GMFI (B/Brisbane). Furthermore, this result seems to be consistent with findings in vaccine research regarding other immunocompromised populations such as HIV infected individuals, where the ability to mount a strong response is largely dependent on CD4+ cell count.The most noteworthy result we recognised was the positive association of day 0 CD3+CD56+ (NKT-like) cell count above the age-specific predicted values and both postvaccination GMT and GMFI. We observed the most predictive role of these cells for the seroresponse against all strains of influenza virus.According to Romero-Olmedo et al. (32), human peripheral blood CD3+CD56+ cells constitute a phenotypical continuum of different natural T cell subsets such as CD8+ or CD4-CD8- (double negative), γδ+ and MAIT cells. They demonstrated that both in healthy and allergic adults, CD3+CD56+ cells were actually part of all major T cell groups rather than a separate group.Expression of CD56 has been associated with cytotoxic and immunostimulatory properties (33) and has been found on several activated cell types that also show cytotoxic properties. This finding suggests that CD56 is more of a sign of activation than a characteristic phenotypical marker.However, we think that these results might have more importance in influenza vaccine research. CD3 and CD56 markers have been associated with NKT cells as well. Although the terminology of these cells is quite discordant (34), they are often referred to as NKT-like cells, a heterogeneous group of T cells that have been the target of extensive research regarding influenza vaccines. CD3+CD56+ (NKT-like) cells can carry out MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity and secrete many kinds of cytokines. They confer natural immunity and play a part in helping the differentiation of helper T cells.Several research groups have demonstrated that activation of NKT cells contribute to the humoral immune response to different microbes (35), however, most of these studies were conducted in animals. In connection with influenza vaccination, these studies demonstrated that use of glycolipid adjuvants (e.g. α-galactosylceramide) as NKT cell activators lead to better immunological response (36–38). Regarding recent investigations into the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, lower percentages of CD3+CD56+ (NKT-like) cells have been observed in COVID-19 subjects when compared to healthy controls. Further comparison of patients with severe and non-severe pneumonia showed significantly lower percentages in the former group of subjects (39).A possible theory is that the relationship between the immune response and the number of NKT-like cells in this immunosuppressed population might originate from their homing characteristics. Most of these cells migrate and reside to different tissues (40), therefore they might form a pool of mobile cells during chemotherapy. However there are only a few reports about findings that support this phenomenon (41, 42).We would like to further investigate and confirm our results by an extended, nationwide study of the connection between prevaccination lymphocyte subpopulations, especially NKT-like cells (with more detailed identification) and the outcome of influenza vaccination in children undergoing chemotherapy.As we expected, a modest immunogenicity was observed in our patients. These findings seemed to be in agreement with published reports.Our study has several limitations. The patient sample was considerably heterogeneous in respect of specific hemato-oncologic diseases and types of cytostatic treatment. Statistically the sample size was quite small and no control group was established. Consequently, our results should be treated with caution. Nevertheless, we tried to compensate it with sampling mostly those patients, who received parenteral cytostatic treatment. Additionally, we used a conventional p value of 0.05.ConclusionTo our knowledge, we revealed for the first time some possible connections between T-lymphocyte subpopulation counts at the time of vaccination and seroresponse to influenza vaccination in immunosuppressed patients. From a practical point of view, although in a small, but highly immunosuppressed study population our investigation suggests a possible positive association between NKT-like cells and postvaccination GMT and GMFI in all three strains following influenza vaccination.After verifying our results on a larger sample with a control group, it can outline a promising direction for research to further specify the associations of the previously mentioned cell populations and their ratios and serologic immunity. Our investigation highlights the need for age-specific reference ranges for T cell subpopulations. Moreover, should our results be verified, they could support the possible advantages of incorporating NKT cell-activating adjuvants into influenza vaccines.Data Availability StatementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics StatementThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Board of the University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary (3672.316-2954/2010).

Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images Life after the 1918 flu has lessons for our post-pandemic world By Kristen Rogers, CNN 9 minute read Updated 9:40 AM EDT, Mon June 28, 2021 Link Copied! CNN — A widespread sense that time has split into two – or pandemics creating a “before” and “after” – is an experience that’s associated with many traumatic events. That’s the reflection of Elizabeth Outka, a professor of English at the University of Richmond and author of “Viral Modernism: The Influenza Pandemic and Interwar Literature.” This social phenomenon is both psychologically and practically relevant, in that pandemics – including the 1918 influenza and Covid-19 pandemics – significantly affect how we assess and act on risk, or stay resilient, but also how we work, play and socialize. The startling and harrowing nature of the 1918 flu and its fatal consequences induced a sense of caution that, in some places, had permanent implications for how people would respond to disease outbreaks in later decades – such as using isolation and quarantine, according to a 2010 paper by Nancy Tomes, a distinguished professor of history at Stony Brook University. Similarly, as the Covid-19 pandemic fades, “some existing trends will remain,” said Jacqueline Gollan, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. For example, the recent expansion and use of online shopping, telehealth services, hybrid work models and technology that allows virtual gatherings will endure, Gollan said. And “given our recognition that global crises occur,” she added, “we’re likely to retain an inventory of cleaning supplies and personal protection materials. We are also likely to adopt habits that improve cleanliness to promote personal or group hygiene.” As the world gradually reopens in a patchwork of ways amid other crises – much like how states’ reopenings varied after the 1918 flu and World War I – we’ll be evaluating many of the lifestyle habits we’ve engaged in before and during the pandemic, said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. These are the changes that might stick around post-pandemic. How we greet people While public health officials discouraged people from unnecessary contact with others during the 1918 flu, some people broke the rules at the height of that pandemic – which meant that, afterward, continued compliance with safety precautions to prevent another outbreak didn’t last for everyone, according to Tomes’ research. As Covid-19 restrictions ease, some people, including infectious disease experts, have felt OK shaking hands again if others are cautious or fully vaccinated. But others didn’t like this social custom even before the pandemic, Wen said. Those who have been wanting to change things up may see now as the opportunity to do so. “I also hope there will be alternatives to handshakes as in, maybe instead of doing handshakes, we have the elbow bump or the namaste greeting as the baseline of a greeting, especially between strangers,” Wen said. Simply waving is another option that’s taken hold. Thinking twice about travel The aftermath of the 1918 flu didn’t keep everyone off of public transportation, but it did create some level of caution about how the virus could spread in such places. As late Canadian physician William Osler observed, the flu traveled only as fast as modern transportation, meaning “it was human bodies and not some ethereal atmospheric force that spread it,” Tomes wrote. Getting the masses to be safe after the 1918 flu was difficult, but minimizing contact via isolations and quarantines seemed “to offer the best chance we have of controlling the ravages of influenza,” wrote late bacteriologist Edwin O. Jordan in 1925. Depending on future rates of cases of coronavirus, flu or other viruses, when choosing travel destinations, people might have considerations they may not have contemplated in the past, Wen said. People ride the subway in New York City on May 26. Noam Galai/Getty Images Travelers’ recent decisions to drive to destinations close to home, rather than fly to faraway places, could indicate there are remaining concerns about Covid-19 risk, experts have said. “In the next few years,” Wen added, “we are going to see coronavirus rage in parts of the world that don’t have it well controlled.” Mask-wearing and other precautions “The influenza pandemic heightened a contrast between the safe home and the dangerous public space that had already become a familiar theme in the late 19th century,” Tomes wrote. The adoption of safety precautions such as coughing into handkerchiefs or avoiding crowds to try to manage the 1918 flu didn’t have a ubiquitously positive impact on individuals’ safety habits over the next decade, since some people abandoned such practices. However, some behaviors did influence how people and institutions responded to later disease outbreaks. An influenza warning notice by the Anti-Tuberculosis League, displays inside public transportation sometime between 1918 and 1920. Cincinnati Museum Center/Archive Photos/Getty Images When influenza broke out in 1928, for example, some colleges and universities immediately isolated people sick with flu, Tomes wrote. “By acting quickly, college authorities at the University of Oregon limited the spread of influenza to less than 15% of the student body.” Interwar educators, advertisers and public health officials “embraced the gospel of germs with great enthusiasm,” Tomes wrote. New health curricula in the 1920s introduced kindergarteners to handkerchiefs, while elementary school children learned versions of the “‘handkerchief drill,’ in which they sneezed into their hankies with military-style precision.” Promoting hygiene by invoking flu fears, some ads for mouthwash, cough drops and tonics reminded readers that “‘a cold may be something far more dangerous,’” Tomes wrote. Women were encouraged to learn the early signs of contagious diseases so they could remind their children and husbands about careful coughing and sneezing and get them to a doctor’s care as soon as possible. (Men being less disciplined about hygiene during the Covid-19 pandemic was a theme of the 1918 flu, too.) Schoolchildren gargle as a precaution against an influenza epidemic that happened in England sometime around 1935. Imagno/Hulton Archive/Getty Images After more than a year of wearing masks to keep ourselves and others safe during the Covid-19 pandemic, some experts foresee masks becoming a permanent part of our arsenal against coronavirus and other viruses or bacteria. “You’re sneezing a little bit, you don’t know whether it’s a cold or allergies – I could imagine people putting on masks in those circumstances or people putting on masks when they’re going traveling,” Wen said. Women in the workforce Flu deaths in 1918 and World War I created substantial workforce vacancies that “provided an opportunity for women to step into lines of work previously deemed inappropriate or too dangerous, such as the textile industry and manufacturing, science and research and even medical laboratory occupations,” wrote Lindsey Clark, an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, in a March 2021 paper. Although World War I made employers reconsider the jobs given to women, women often remained in traditionally feminine roles, like these women sewing fabric onto aircraft wings at an English factory in 1918. Elsewhere in this factory, however, women were beginning to work alongside men in jobs such as carpentry. English Heritage/Heritage Images/Getty Images These feats were catalysts for women gaining social and financial independence, and the right to vote in 1920. While the 1918 pandemic drew women into the workforce in different ways, reports have shown the Covid-19 pandemic forced more than 2.3 million women to give up their roles. “When schools and daycares shut down or moved to a virtual platform, women’s jobs were disproportionately affected because they are still the primary care givers in the home,” Clark wrote. “In one survey, 1 in 4 women who became unemployed during this pandemic did so due to lack of childcare – double the rate of men.” These disparities could urge employers and academia to consider alternatives, Clark added, such as flexible work schedules and virtual courses that would allow women more feasible access to higher education.

Jayme Gershen/Bloomberg/Getty Images Difficulty finding child care and jobs as the world reopens could cause challenging or insurmountable career setbacks and financial losses, CNN has previously reported. Some schools and child care facilities are still somewhat remote, operating on shorter schedules or fully booked, according to another recent CNN report – and some children’s exposure to Covid-19 at school has caused parents to have to temporarily telework again, causing friction between resuming business as normal and the lasting pandemic effects on the community side. Scientific progress In 1918, “the infrastructure of scientific research was a tiny fraction, infinitesimal compared to today,” said John M. Barry, author of “The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History.” “But the response of the scientific community was very solid today, that basically everybody dropped whatever they were doing and tried to work on the disease. Now, given the timeframe even today, we would not have developed the vaccine in time to do anything against that (1918) pandemic because it moved so quickly. And, of course, they did try to develop vaccines, but they didn’t know what the pathogen was.” The research that defined viruses came several years after the 1918 pandemic. The Covid-19 aftermath will bring “measurable changes” and scientific advances, Barry added, since academic silos have broken down in a good way, allowing interdisciplinary research, collaboration and creativity that have paid off in the fields of medicine, technology and more.

This data analysis infrastructure could be useful for endeavors such as mitigating potential future epidemics and studying how climate and seasonality might have contributed to coronavirus spread. Childhood changes After the Covid-19 pandemic shifted many children from in-person schooling to virtual learning, some parents have grown fond of homeschooling while others probably would rather never, ever attempt it again. “According to a survey by EdChoice, 64 percent of parents said their view of homeschooling has become more favorable as a result of the pandemic,” Joshua Coleman, a psychologist in private practice in Oakland, California, and a senior fellow with the Council on Contemporary Families, told CNN via email. “On the other hand, many of those who were forced into it said that it was incredibly hard and not something they wanted to repeat,” added Coleman, the author of “Rules of Estrangement: Why Adult Children Cut Ties & How to Heal the Conflict.” Hamza Haqqani, a then-second grader at Al-Huda Academy, participates in an e-learning class while at his home in Illinois on May 1, 2020. Scott Olson/Getty Images Regardless of whether parents continue to homeschool, their children could still take on extracurriculars without the commute. “Even though I’ve studied remote work and taught online classes, I’d always assumed that my kids’ oboe lessons and art classes would always be in person with remote instruction being a suboptimal modality for such classes,” said Ravi S. Gajendran, Florida International University’s chair of the global leadership and management department, and associate professor in the College of Business. “But I’ve been surprised at how close online classes are to the in-person experience and am more open as a consequence.” The future of work During the deadly second wave of the 1918 flu, a health committee recommended stores and factories stagger their business hours, and that people try to walk to work to prevent overcrowding on public transportation, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those suggestions don’t seem to have lasted long after that pandemic. In contrast, Covid-19 forced many businesses to close or go completely virtual, and one of the most significant areas in which we’ll likely see lasting, post-coronavirus pandemic changes is in how work is performed, Gajendran said. “Companies are likely to think of remote work as a business continuity mechanism, one that they can readily shift to if new variants of the coronavirus emerge that get past the protections the current vaccines afford,” Gajendran said via email. “This is also likely to make hybrid work a key part of how work is performed because it provides flexibility not only with dealing with the pandemic but also offers a way of keeping operations going during other emergencies such as natural disasters and terror attacks.” More of our daily lives – such as meetings, appointments, trainings and activities both inside and outside of work – might be conducted online, Gajendran said. “Offices are going to be redesigned with the assumption that a lot of work and collaboration is going to involve a higher proportion of online interactions than in the past.” Resulting changes, like fewer business lunches, could shuffle cities built on downtown, in-person work, Barry said. “I think the architecture may change and (have) more focus on ventilation in buildings. I hope they go back to the ability to open a window in an office building,” he added, laughing. “That would be nice.” CNN’s Rachel Trent and Anneken Tappe contributed to this story.

CloseInside the lungs, a new hope for protection a | EurekAlert! Advanced Search Home News Releases Multimedia Meetings Login Register News Release 2-Jul-2021 Inside the lungs, a new hope for protection against flu damage New experimental data pinpoints a molecular component responsible for modulating the damage the flu can wreck on the lungs Peer-Reviewed Publication Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia image: New hope to modulate the damage the flu wrecks on the lungs view more Credit: Joana Carvalho, IGC 2021 The seasonal flu kills up to 600 000 people a year worldwide and has a century-long history of pandemics. Examples include the Spanish flu in the late 1910's or the H1N1 in 2009, which together claimed more than 50 million lives. "The way the stage is set tells us that it is not a matter of if but rather of when there will be a next pandemic. And preparing ourselves for that demands intensive fundamental research and constant accumulation of knowledge about these viruses and the diseases they cause", says Maria João Amorim, IGC principal investigator and leader of the team that conducted the study. When a virus like influenza enters our lungs, it is quickly faced with cocktails of molecules that recognize it and alert the host of its presence. Signals flow back and activate the immune response, calling in an army of cells and inflammation sidekicks. Any exaggeration can destabilize the equilibrium needed to clear the virus and spare our tissues from damage. For most people, clearance arrives a few days after infection and leaves very few traces. But for some, influenza infection entails severe complications, resulting from an exacerbated response that damages the lungs. "We found that DAF, which stands for decay accelerating factor, aggravates influenza A infection and increases damage to the lungs in mice. This virulence mechanism of influenza, and the molecular regulation that underpins it, are new for us", Maria João Amorim reveals. DAF is a receptor found at the surface of most cells that functions to protect them from being attacked by one of our own immune surveillance systems--the complement. This system protects us against invading pathogens once it detects them in circulation, by inactivating the pathogen itself, or inside infected cells, by mounting a strategy to eliminate them. "But this can work as double-edged sword because if complement destroys cells from the host, there is the associated danger of provoking excessive self-injury by eliminating too many bystander cells and promoting inflammation. In fact, disease severity and mortality have been associated with both lack or excess of complement activation, which is tuned by regulators such as DAF", remarks Nuno Santos, first author of the study. Contrary to expectations, the team found that influenza A virus exploits DAF to potentiate complement activation as an immune evasion mechanism, increasing the recruitment of immune cells. "By doing so, it can exacerbate the immune response, and this is what damages the lungs. Remarkably, this occurs in a way that is independent of viral load, telling us that it directly affects resilience to infection", says Zoé Vaz da Silva, coauthor of the study. The role of DAF upon influenza infection can depend on how it interacts with some parts of the virus, leading to more or less aggravated responses. "The complement system is important, but not the only component that determines the outcome of the infection. These interactions have functional implications and are an unprecedented way of a virus, via altering a host protein from within the infected cell, to modulate the immune response. Studying this further in the future is crucial", Maria João Amorim says. ### This work highlights a novel immune evasion strategy by influenza A virus and stresses the importance of a balanced immune response to viral infections, which allows disease clearance without causing damage. Despite its intrinsic protective role, the immune system can be the cause of severe complications during influenza A infection.

CONTINUE READING ENJOY UNLIMITED ACCES TO C&EN Vaccines Bacterial protein could eliminate need for adjuvants in flu vaccines Nanoparticles made of a protein carrying a flu antigen increased survival of mice infected with two strains of influenza by Lakshmi Supriya, special to C&EN June 28, 2021 Advertisement Most Popular in Pharmaceuticals Drug companies are investing big in psychedelics, but can they engineer out the trip? Without these lipid shells, there would be no mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 Vilya designs new macrocyclic peptides Enlaza Therapeutics marries covalent and biologic drugs Empress Therapeutics mines microbial genomes for drugs Credit: ACS Nano BP26 proteins (green) from the Brucella bacterium are modified with an antigen consisting of a sequence of eight M2e influenza virus proteins (red). Sixteen of the modified proteins self-assemble into a nanobarrel structure (right) that could be used in a vaccine. Some commercial influenza vaccines contain adjuvants, components added to increase immune response and enhance the vaccines’ effectiveness. Although these adjuvants generally cause only mild side effects, if any, in rare cases they can trigger serious adverse effects such as inflammation and allergic reactions. Now, researchers report that a flu vaccine using a modified bacterial protein can stimulate a strong immune response without needing an adjuvant. Also, the vaccine candidate increased survival of mice infected with different flu viruses, opening up the possibility of using the protein in a universal flu vaccine, one that would not have to be reformulated each year to match the virus strains in circulation (ACS Nano 2021, DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.1c04078). Flu vaccines use a molecule from the surface of the virus, or antigen, to elicit an immune response. But the antigen by itself may not be enough to generate adequate response, thus requiring the addition of an adjuvant. To better mimic how the flu virus stimulates the immune system, researchers have made nanoparticles with antigens attached to their surface. “We searched pathogenic bacteria for a self-assembled protein nanoarchitecture that could serve as a new antigen-delivery vehicle,” says Sangyong Jon of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), who is a corresponding author of the new study. Previously, Ji-Joon Song of KAIST and colleagues reported that an outer membrane protein, BP26, from a Brucella bacterium can self-assemble into a barrel-like nanostructure made of 16 protein units (J. Mol. Biol. 2013, DOI: 10.1016/j.jmb.2013.01.015). The protein has also been found to stimulate a strong immune response in mice. So, Jon, Song, and their team connected BP26 protein units to their chosen antigen, a flu virus protein called M2e. The units then assembled themselves into a nanobarrel structure with M2e on the surface. M2e is present in most types of flu viruses and is conserved, meaning it doesn’t mutate much, increasing the possibility of using it in a potential universal flu vaccine. The team immunized mice with three doses of the nanobarrel particles and later infected the animals with an H1N1 influenza A strain. The mice had a 90% survival rate, whereas nonimmunized mice infected with H1N1 all died. The team also tested the vaccine candidate against a different strain of influenza A (H1N1pdm09), one that caused a 2009 pandemic. Immunized mice had a survival rate of 75% whereas all the nonvaccinated mice died. Adjuvants are needed when trying to use conserved regions of the flu virus to elicit an immune response, says Xavier Saelens of VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology, who studies flu viruses and was not involved in the study. “The approach with the nanocages is novel because it makes use of a very small VLP [virus-like particle].” Saelens adds that the researchers can produce the nanoparticles in Escherichia coli, a simple bacterium, “and thus, in principle, their vaccine is very cheap to produce.” Chemical & Engineering News ISSN 0009-2347 Copyright © 2024 American Chemical Society You might also like...

Here, we developed multi-clade VLPs expressing two HAs (a chimera of clade 2.3.2.1c and clade 2.3.4.4c HA) within a single vector. We then compared its protective efficacy with that of a monovalent VLP and evaluated its potency against each homologous strain. Chickens vaccinated with the multi-clade VLP shed less virus and were better protected against challenge than birds receiving monovalent vaccines. Single vaccination with a multi-clade VLP resulted in 100% survival, with no clinical symptoms and high levels of pre-challenge protective immunity (7.6–8.5 log2). Moreover, the multi-clade VLP showed high productivity (128–256 HAU) both in the laboratory and on a large scale, making it cheaper than whole inactivated vaccines produced in eggs. However, the PD50 (protective dose 50%) of the multi-clade VLP against clades 2.3.2.1c and 2.3.4.4c was < 50 PD50 (28 and 42 PD50, respectively), and effective antibody response was maintained for 2–3 months. This multi-clade VLP protects against both clades of HPAI viruses and can be produced in high amounts at low cost. Thus, the vaccine has potential as a pandemic preparedness vaccine.

Novel HPAI H5Nx viruses, including various NA, have emerged continuously due to extensive genetic reassortment activity; indeed, various clades have emerged due to genetic evolution and antigenic drift3,4,5. As a result, persistent HPAI outbreaks on poultry farms in many countries have been caused by mutated viruses, resulting in serious economic losses1. Moreover, various subtypes of HPAI have emerged simultaneously in countries such as China (H5N6, H5N1), Vietnam (H5N6, H5N1), and Taiwan (H5N2, H5N5), making it difficult to eradicate the virus6.Since the emergence of H5N1 on a poultry farm in 2003, H5 HPAI outbreaks have occurred continuously, and new influenza viruses and genotypes have been introduced into Korea7,8. Various clades of H5Nx, including H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8, have been identified9,10,11,12,13. In particular, outbreaks of HPAI subtypes H5N6 and H5N8 occurred simultaneously in 201714. During the unprecedented outbreaks of HPAI in 2016/2017, there has been increased demand for AIV vaccination by poultry producers and animal welfare organizations. Potential vaccines in the future should be considered with introduction of two or more viruses simultaneously around Korea.Vaccination policy may be a supportable measure for preventing HPAI when implemented properly and in conjunction with accurate epidemiologic investigation and control measures7,15. Until recently, most AI vaccines used or registered in the field were whole inactivated AI vaccines16. VLPs are a vaccine platform that can respond effectively to a wide range of infectious viruses17,18. A previous study examined the efficacy of VLP vaccines against multi-clade H5N12, whereas another showed that VLP displaying H5, H7, H9, and N1 protect chicken from infection by heterologous virus19. However, preparation of a multivalent vaccine against various HPAI viruses by mixing monovalent whole inactivated vaccines raises biosecurity concerns and is economically unfeasible20. Therefore, a vaccine based on VLP requires stronger product development through further studies examining multi-subunit, chimeric, and other types of VLPs; such studies should focus on delivery of sufficient amounts of VLP antigen because these vaccines will not be competitive in the market unless they are both productive and cost-effective21.Here, we constructed a single vector containing cassettes encoding multi-clade VLPs and then manufactured multi-clade VLPs as a vaccine capable of protecting against two separate clades of HPAI virus. We then compared its protective efficacy with that of a monovalent VLP and evaluated its potency against each homologous strain in specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken.ResultsExpression and preparation of monovalent and multi-clade VLPsMonovalent VLP_ES2, VLP_KA435, and VLP_KA435chi, and multi-clade VLP_ES2/KA435chi vaccines, were produced and secreted successfully from Sf9 cells. The HA titer of VLP_ES2 in the culture supernatant ranged from 128 to 256 HAU. However, the HA titer of VLP_KA435 was as low as 32–64 HAU. The titer of VLP _KA435chi ranged from 128 to 256 HAU. The titer of the multi-clade VLP_ES2/KA435chi was 128–256 HAU. After large-scale production, the titer of the multi-clade VLP was also 128–256 HAU per 25 L of medium (the same as lab-scale production) (Table 1). The multi-clade VLP was purified from the culture supernatant and examined by transmission electron microscopy and western blot (Fig. 1). Table 1 Expression and proliferation of VLPs.Full size tableFigure 1Transmission electron microscopy (EM) and Western blot analysis of multi-clade VLPs. Negative stain (1% uranyl acetate) EM image of multi-clade VLPs (Scale bar is 100 nm, red arrow indicates multi-clade VLP and blue arrow indicate baculoviral particle) (A). Blots were incubated with chicken anti-HA antiserum and goat ant-chicken IgG (HRP). HA and M specific bands were detected in preparations of multi clade VLP infected cells (B).Full size imageComparison of the efficacy between monovalent and multi-clade VLP vaccinationNext, we compared the protective efficacy of the monovalent and multi-clade VLP vaccines in SPF chickens infected with KA435/2.3.2.1c and ES2/2.3.4.4c. A 100% survival rate was observed in all groups of SPF chickens, except the group receiving the VLP_KA435 vaccine (90%), after challenge with homologous HPAI (Table 2). All SPF chickens vaccinated with VLPs had seroconverted before challenge, with a mean HI titer of 5.6–9.0 log2 against each antigen. SPF chickens vaccinated with the multi-clade VLP had a mean HI titer of 7.0–7.3 log2 against both antigens. In SN test, sera from the multi-clade VLP vaccinated chickens induced mean SN titer 72–524 (range from 20 to 1280) against both antigens before challenge, and sera from monovalent VLP vaccinated chickens induced mean SN titer 26 and 62 (range from 0 to 160) against each homologous antigen although they show no reaction in cross SN test. After challenge with KA435/2.3.2.1c and ES2/2.3.4.4c, all vaccinated chickens produced green stools and diarrhea, and some became lethargic. Virus shedding was detected from 1–5 dpi, with a viral titer of 101.3–102.2 TCID50/0.1 mL in OP swab samples and 101.6–102.0 TCID50/0.1 mL from 1 to 5 dpi in CL swab samples. In the multi-clade VLP vaccinated groups, virus shedding was detected at 1 dpi in an OP sample from one chicken, with viral titer of 101.3 TCID50/0.1 mL, after challenge with KA435/2.3.2.1c; no virus shedding was detected in birds challenged with ES2/2.3.4.4c. In the sham groups challenged with KA435/2.3.2.1c and ES2/2.3.4.4c, virus shedding was detected at 1 dpi in seven chickens, with a viral titer of 102.0–102.2 TCID50/0.1 mL only in the OP swab sample. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) at 1 dpi in the viral titers in OP swab samples from sham-vaccinated chickens and SPF chickens vaccinated with the multi-clade VLP vaccine against KA435/2.3.2.1c (Table 2).Table 2 Results among single and multivalent vaccinations against homologous and heterologous HPAI.Full size tablePotency and efficacy of the chimeric multi-clade VLP vaccination against each homologous challengeClinical protectionFor SPF chickens, vaccination with one dose conferred 100% clinical protection, with no clinical symptoms evident after challenge with KA435/2.3.2.1c and ES2/2.3.4.4c. However, the group vaccinated with one-tenth dose and then challenged with KA435/2.3.2.1c suffered 20% mortality by 6 dpi (Fig. 2A). Vaccination with one-hundredth dose resulted in even higher mortality (around 70%) at 6 dpi. Mortality in the group receiving one-hundredth dose of the multi-clade VLP vaccine and then challenged with KA435/2.3.2.1c was 100%, showing neurological signs and diarrhea; however, in the group challenged with ES2/2.3.4.4c, eight chickens died at 7–8 dpi post-challenge (Fig. 2B) after showing neurological signs and diarrhea. The mean time to death in one-hundredth dose vaccination groups challenged with either virus was 3.3–3.4 days. For sham-treated chickens, the mean time to death was 2.5–2.6 days.Figure 2Survival of vaccinated chickens challenged with each homologous HPAIV.

(B) ES2/2.3.4.4c.Full size imageClinical protection was also indicated by the vaccine potency (PD50) results22, with SPF chickens challenged with the KA435 or ES2 viruses showing potency values of 28 and 42 PD50, respectively (Table 3).Table 3 Results of vaccination with varying doses of multi-clade VLP against two homologous HPAI.Full size tableSerologyAll vaccinated groups showed detectable antibody titers against ES2 and KA435 antigens pre-challenge and post-challenge; these titers increased over time (Fig. 3). In vaccinated SPF chickens (one dose or one-tenth dose), all those receiving the multi-clade VLP vaccine seroconverted before challenge, with a mean tier of 7.2–7.8 and 3.9–4.7 log2 after one dose and one-tenth dose, respectively. After challenge, the antibody titer against ES2 and KA435 antigens increased to 7.9–8.5 log2 and 6.5–7.6 log2 in the one dose and one-tenth dose groups, respectively. Unlike the one dose- and one-tenth dose-vaccinated groups, the one-hundredth dose-vaccinated groups showed a weaker antibody response (1.0 log2) prior to challenge. Following challenge, the HI titer of surviving chickens challenged with ES2 had more various antibody responses, with HI titers around 6.0 log2 (Fig. 3B). None of the sham-vaccinated chickens had detectable HI antibodies before challenge (data not shown).Figure 3Serological responses in vaccinated and challenged chickens. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay titers in vaccinated chickens measured at different times post-vaccination and challenged with homologous virus. HI titers were assessed at 14 days post-vaccination (dpv), at 21 dpv, and at 14 days post-infection (dpi) with homologous virus. Chickens received one (1) dose, one-tenth (1/10) dose, or one-hundredth (1/100) dose. (A) Challenge with KA435/2.3.2.1c. (B) Challenge with ES2/2.3.4.4c. Individual data points are shown, along with mean and standard error.Full size imageVirus sheddingAs shown in Fig. 4, little virus shedding was observed from 3 to 7 dpi in SPF chickens vaccinated with one dose of the multi-clade VLP. However, virus shedding was detected from 3 to 7 dpi in SPF chickens vaccinated with one-tenth dose of the multi-clade VLP and challenged with either KA435/2.3.2.1c or ES2/2.3.4.4c. In SPF chickens vaccinated with one-hundredth dose, virus shedding was detected in surviving birds, with a viral titer of 101.7–102.8 TCID50/0.1 mL in OP swab samples from 3–5 dpi and 102.4–104.0 TCID50/0.1 mL in CL swab samples from 3 to 5 dpi. Most birds in the sham-vaccinated groups were not tested because they died prior to sampling (Fig. 4).Figure 4Virus shedding in oropharyngeal (OP) and cloacal (CL) swab samples after inoculation with homologous HPAIV. Titers of virus shed in OP and CL samples from chicken sham-vaccinated or inoculated with vaccines at one (1) dose, one-tenth (1/10) dose, or one-hundredth (1/100) dose; titers were measured at 3, 5, and 7 days post-infection (dpi) with each homologous H5 HPAIV. Viral titers are expressed as log10TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose)/0.1 mL, with error bars. (A) KA435/2.3.2.1c. (B) ES2/2.3.4.4c. The lower limit of detection was 1 log10TCID50/0.1 mL.Full size imageAntibody persistenceWe measured the mean HI titers against ES2 and KA435 antigens in SPF chickens and layer chickens inoculated with one dose of the multi-clade VLP vaccine. In SPF chickens vaccinated with the multi-clade VLP, HI titers against the KA435 antigen were 9.3 log2 and those against the ES2 antigen were 7.8 log2 at 3 wpv. The mean HI titers peaked between 3 wpv, and remained above 7 log2 to provide reduction in challenge virus replication and shedding23 by 12 wpv (KA435) and 16 wpv (ES2) (Fig. 5A). In layer chickens vaccinated with the multi-clade VLP, HI titers against the KA435 antigen were 7.4 log2, and those against the ES2 antigen were 8.6 log2 at 3 wpv. The mean HI titers peaked at 3 wpv, and remained above 7 log2 by 8 wpv (KA435) and 3 wpv (ES2). None of the chickens showed HI titers above 7 log2 at 24 wpv (Fig. 5B).Figure 5Antibody persistence following administration of one dose (512 HAU) of vaccine. (A) SPF chickens. (B) Layer chickens. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay titers were determined up to 24 weeks post-vaccination. Titers are expressed as log2 values. The horizontal dotted line indicates a HI titer of 7 log2, which is the standard threshold for preventing virus shedding.Full size imageDiscussionHere, we constructed a vector containing cassettes for multi-clade VLP into which two kinds of HA can be inserted. We then manufactured a multi-clade VLP vaccine by inserting the HA sequence of clade 2.3.2.1c(chimera) and 2.3.4.4c vaccine strains from the Korean AI national antigen bank. Finally, we compared the efficacy of monovalent and multi-clade VLP vaccines in SPF chickens challenged with homologous strains.Chickens vaccinated with the multi-clade VLP shed less virus and were better protected against challenge than chickens vaccinated with the monovalent vaccine. This is likely because multivalent vaccines trigger stronger cellular and humoral responses, thereby inhibiting viral replication more effectively than the monovalent VLP vaccines24,25. Moreover, one chicken vaccinated with the monovalent VLP_KA435chi died, despite showing a higher HI titer (9.0 log2) (Table 2); this may be because the HA2 of KA435 was substituted with the HA2 of Buan2, coupled with challenge with the more virulent 2.3.2.1c strain as reported previously26, and induction of lower SN titer which more closely related to the capability of antibodies controlling the replication of virus comparing HI titer27.For use in an antigen bank, an emergency vaccine should show a minimum 50 PD50 per dose, or antibody persistence above and HI of 1/128 HI for 6 months post-vaccination; in Korea, the guidelines are a minimum 80% protection from mortality and an HI titer of greater than 1/12814. In this study, the PD50 and antibody persistence of the multi-clade VLP did not meet these criteria or were lower than those of whole inactivated vaccinated chickens in comparison with the results of a previous study26. Whole inactivated vaccines induce a stronger immune response than subunit vaccines such as VLP vaccines28. Therefore, we believe that our results are due to the fact that the VLP vaccine is based on part (M and HA) of the virus. Indeed, other studies show that whole inactivated vaccines are more effective in potency tests than split, subunit vaccines and virosomes; also, whole inactivated vaccines have a significantly higher probability of inducing seroconversion than subunit vaccines29,30. Further study is needed on how multi-clade VLP increases protective efficacy comparing to whole inactivated vaccines.Our multi-subtype vector includes a cassette into which two full HAs are co-localized within one VLP structure2; we then ensured high protein expression (128–256 HAU) by producing a chimeric VLP under optimized cell culture conditions. Indeed, productivity in cell culture was equal to that after large-scale (25 L) production (Table 2), and higher than that after large-scale production reported by other studies (e.g., 16–128 HAU in Sf9 cells)2,31. This process enables cost savings of approximately 0.02 dollars per dose when compared with mixing two types (0.068 dollars per dose) of whole inactivated vaccine using the egg product system of the Korean AI national bank (data not shown). This means that the multi-clade VLP we developed in this study may be economically more viable than vaccines cultured in eggs. In addition, multi-clade VLPs effectively induce Th1 type immune responses, and plasma and memory B cells32. Only single vaccination of multi-clade VLP with a dose of 512 HAU showed immunogenicity, survival rate and reduction of virus shedding in similar to results boosting other VLP vaccination2,19,33.In conclusion, we constructed a single vector containing cassettes encoding multi-clade VLPs and produced a chimeric vaccine capable of protecting chickens against simultaneous challenge with clade 2.3.2.1c and 2.3.4.4c HPAIVs. Large amounts of vaccine were produced in cell culture, making the vaccine potentially cost-effective. However, the PD50 and antibody persistence were below national standards and lower than those of whole inactivated vaccines. Taken together, these results suggest that the multi-clade VLP vaccine is an economically effective vaccine that protects against infection by multiple HPAIVs.Materials and methodsCell and virusesSf9 insect cells (Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) and Trichoplusia ni (Tni) insect cells were maintained in suspension in SF-900 III SFM medium (Gibco) and ESF 921 (Expression system, Davis, CA, USA), respectively, at 27 °C. Three different H5 HPAIVs from the Korean national antigen bank14 were used as seed strains and challenge strains. A/duck/Korea/ES2/2016(H5N6, clade 2.3.4.4c)12, hereafter called ES2/2.3.4.4c, and A/broiler duck/Korea/Buan2/2014(H5N8, clade 2.3.4.4a)11, hereafter called Buan2/2.3.4.4a, were isolated from poultry farms in Korea; A/chicken/Vietnam/NCVD-KA435/13(H5N1, clade 2.3.2.1c)14, hereafter called KA435/2.3.2.1c, was kindly provided by the National Center for Veterinary Diagnostics in Vietnam. A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1), hereafter named PR8, was used for cloning of the M1 gene. Viruses were propagated for 60 h in 10-day-old embryonated eggs from SPF chickens.Cloning of HA and M genesViral RNA was extracted from ES2/2.3.4.4c, KA435/2.3.2.1c, Buan2/2.3.4.4a, and PR8 using RNeasy mini kit (Intron, Korea). To amplify DNA from extracted viral RNA, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using the RT kit (Intron) and specific primers containing restriction enzyme sequences. The following primer pairs were used for PCR amplification of modified HA genes with deletion of the polybasic amino acid region and the M1 gene: HA_ES2 (F) 5′-CGTGCGGGATCCATGGAGAAAATAGTGCTTCT-3′ and (R) 5′-AATAGGAAGCTTTTAAATGCAAATTCTTGCATT-3′; HA_KA435 (F) TGGACTACTAGTATGGAGAAGATCGTTCTTCT-3′ and (R) 5′-GAGTACGTCGACTTAAATGCAAATACGCACT-3′; M1_PR8 (F) CAATCGAGCATGCTCTCCCTCTTGAGCTTCCTA-3′ and (R) 5′-TGCCAGTCCCGGGATGAGTCTTCTAACCGAGGT-3′; HA1_KA435 (F) 5′-TGGACTACTAGTATGGAGAAGATCGTTCTTCT-3′ and (R) 5′-AGGAGTGGCGCCCCAAACAGTCCTCTTTTGCG-3′; HA2_Buan2 (F) 5′-TGTAAGCCTAGGATGGAGATAATTAAAATGAT-3′ and (R) 5′-AGCGGTCCTAGGATCAGATCCAGACATGATAA-3′. Amplified HA and M1 genes were cloned into the TA cloning vector pGEM®-T (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and each sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Construction of expression vectors and generation of recombinant baculovirusM1 of PR8 (M1_PR8) digested with SmaI/SphI and T4 DNA ligase (Takara, Japan) was used to ligate the resulting M1 DNA fragment into the SmaI/SphI-digested multi-cloning site (MCS) pFastBac™ dual vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) under the control of promotor10 (p10) (Fig. 6Aa). HA of ES2 (HA_ES2) and HA of KA435 (HA_KA435) were digested by BanH1/HindIII, and the resulting HA DNA fragments were each ligated into the BanH1/HindIII-digested polyhedron (PH) of the MCS pFastBac™ dual vector (Invitrogen) (Fig. 6Ab,Ac). To increase protein expression, HA_KA435 was constructed as a chimeric structure (HA_KA435chi). HA2 of KA435 and HA2 of Buan2 (HA_Buan2) were digested by KasI/HindIII, and HA2 of HA_KA435 was substituted with HA2 of HA_Buan2 (Fig. 6Ad). HA_KA435chi was digested by AvrII, and the resulting HA DNA fragment was ligated into the AvrII site of the pFastBac™ dual vector to generate a multi-clade VLP containing M1_PR8, HA_ES2, and HA_KA435chi (HA_ES2/KA435chi) (Fig. 6B).Figure 6Baculovirus construct for production of multi-clade VLPs. (A) (a) M1 of PR8 (M1_PR8) is inserted between restriction enzyme sites for SphI and SmaI, and the HAs of (b) ES2, (c) KA435 (HA_ES2 and HA_KA435), and (d) chimera of KA435 (HA_KA435chi) are inserted between restriction sites for BamHI and HindIII. (B) The M1 gene is under the control of the p10 promoter (PP10); the HA of ES2 (HA_ES2) is under the control of the polyhedron promoter (PPH); and the HA chimera of KA435 (HA_KA435chi), inserted into the AvrII restriction site, is under the control of the polyhedron promoter (PPH).Full size imageThe constructed pFastBac™ dual vector plasmids pHA_ES2, pHA_KA435, pHA_KA435chi, and pHA_ES2/KA435chi were transformed into DH10Bac™ competent cells (Invitrogen) to generate recombinant bacmids. Recombinant bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf9 cells seeded in 6-well plates (8 × 105 cells/well) using Cellfectin® Reagent (Invitrogen), resulting in the release of recombinant baculovirus (rBV) into the culture medium. At 72 h post-transfection, culture medium was harvested and inoculated into Sf9 cells to generate a high titer rBV stock. Titration of the baculovirus stock was performed in a plaque assay on Sf9 cells.Vaccine developmentTo express each monovalent VLP (VLP_ES2, VLP_KA435, and VLP_KA435chi) and multi-clade VLP (HA_ES2/KA435chi), Sf9 cells (2 × 106 cells/mL) were infected for 3 days with recombinant baculovirus expressing HA and M1 (for monovalent HA expression), or with two HAs and M1 (for multi-clade protein expression) at a multiplicity of infection of 1. The cultured medium containing VLPs was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g to remove cell debris. The culture supernatant was chemically treated with formalin (final concentration, 0.1%) to inactivate baculovirus. For large-scale production, Tni insect cells34 under optimized condition in similar with that of Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing VLPs. VLPs were harvested from the medium supernatant, purified on sucrose gradient and concentrated by pump system (100 kDa filtration) (Masterflex). VLP expression of influenza protein was confirmed by Coomassie staining of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, western blot carried out using chicken anti-HA antiserum and goat anti chicken IgG (HRP)(KPL) and by nucleotide sequence analysis and hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) tests against homologous antibody. Viral growth was tested in a hemagglutination activity (HA) assay, and titers were adjusted to yield 512 HA units per dose after emulsifying (30:70, w/w) in Montanide ISA VG70 oil adjuvant (SEPPIC, La Garenne-Colombes, France)35.Transmission electron microscopy of VLPsThe VLP suspension was placed on formvar-coated (copper 300 mash) grids, negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and dried by aspiration. The VLP particles were then examined under a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi7100FA, Tokyo, Japan).Efficacy of the monovalent and multi-clade VLP vaccinesTo compare the efficacy of the monovalent vaccines with that of the multi-clade VLP vaccine, 60 5-week-old SPF chickens were divided into six groups (10 chickens per group). The four groups used for vaccination comprised two groups of chickens receiving monovalent VLP vaccines (VLP_ES2 or VLP_KA435chi) and two groups receiving the multi-clade VLP (VLP_ES2/KA435chi) vaccine. All VLP vaccines were emulsified in Montanide ISA VG70 adjuvant and injected via the intramuscular route; each chicken received 0.5 mL. Another 20 SPF chickens were split into two sham groups and injected with an emulsified solution of PBS plus ISA VG70 in the same ratio as the VLP vaccines. Serum samples were collected from all chickens at weekly intervals post-vaccination and then at 14 days post infection (dpi). To determine the immunogenicity of the VLP vaccines, all sera were tested by HI test against homologous and heterologous, and Serum neutralizing antibody test (SN test) in Dermal Fibroblast 1 (DF1) cells, as described previously36. Three weeks after vaccination, two groups of vaccinated chickens were challenged with 0.1 mL ES2/2.3.4.4c and KA435/2.3.2.1c (106.0 EID50/0.1 mL). All birds were observed daily for 14 dpi to check mortality, clinical signs, and viral shedding. To determine viral shedding, oropharyngeal (OP) and cloacal (CL) swab samples were collected at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 dpi. Each OP or CL sample was suspended in 1 mL of maintenance medium containing an antibiotic–antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen). Samples were used to inoculate cultures of Dermal Fibroblast 1 (DF1) cells, and virus growth was determined by detection of cytopathic effects and measurement of HA activity. Virus titers were calculated as described elsewhere22. The limit of virus detection was < 1 log10 TCID50/0.1 mL. All experiments with live H5 virus were performed in biosafety level 3 facilities and in accordance with guidelines approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, Korea (approval number: 2019-492 and 2020-544). Our study is conducted in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines (https://arriveguidelines.org).Potency and efficacy of multi-clade VLP vaccination against each homologous challengeTo evaluate the potency (PD50, protective dose 50%) and efficacy of the multi-clade VLP vaccine, 40 6-week-old SPF chickens for each HA antigen (ES2/2.3.4.4c and KA435/2.3.2.1c) were divided into four groups (10 chickens per group): three immunization groups and one non-immunization (sham) group. Chickens were immunized intramuscularly with one dose, one-tenth (1/10) dose, or one-hundredth 1(1/100) dose of vaccine in Montanide ISA VG70. The sham group was inoculated with PBS in ISA VG70. At 3 weeks post-vaccination (wpv), chickens were challenged intranasally with 106 EID50 (in 0.1 mL) of a virus homologous to the vaccine strain. Post-challenge, chickens were monitored daily for clinical signs and mortality. The PD50 was calculated using mortality as the end point, as described previously22.Serology and antibody assaysTo determine the immunogenicity of the VLP vaccines, serum samples were collected from all chickens prior to vaccination and then at weekly intervals post-vaccination. Serum samples were also obtained from all living chickens at 14 days post-challenge. All sera were subjected to HI tests. The HI titer against clade 2.3.2.1c and clade 2.3.4.4c antigens was measured using OIE standard HI methods.Post-challenge virus sheddingOP and CL swabs were collected from animals in all groups at 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 dpi. Each sample was suspended in 1 mL of maintenance medium containing an antibiotic–antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen). Samples were treated and inoculated onto DF1 cells as mentioned above.Antibody persistenceTo determine the persistence of protection provided by the VLP vaccines, 10 6-week-old SPF chickens and 10 14-week-old unimmunized layer chickens (these chickens did not even have the H9N2 vaccine) from a poultry farm in Korea were immunized with a single dose. Blood samples were collected from all immunized chickens every month for 6 months post-vaccination.Statistical analysisData were analyzed using Prism version 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Comparison of serum titers between the groups was made using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Survival rates among groups were analyzed using the log-rank test. The statistical significance of differences between measurements was determined using Student’s t-test. A p-value < 0.05 was deemed significant.Ethical statementsAll experiments with live H5 virus were performed in biosafety level 3 facilities and in accordance with guidelines approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, Korea (approval number: 2019-492 and 2020-544).

After repeated lockdowns, long separations from friends and family and economic losses, Canadians are lining up overnight at pop-up clinics and crashing websites with their eagerness to book appointments. Canada is currently a global leader with over 75 per cent of the eligible population, as of June 25, having received their first dose. Click here for more articles in our series about vaccine confidence. Does this mean we can stop worrying about vaccine uptake? Experience from history suggests not. As historians Heather MacDougall and Laurence Monnais have argued, people do not get the recommended vaccines for a variety of reasons, including apathy. Another reason is misinformation, like the unfounded and discredited claim that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine can cause autism. Read more: Private messages contribute to the spread of COVID-19 conspiracies Some are not convinced that the disease in question will impact them or their families. Others are deterred by the difficulty of accessing the vaccine. More than a few are scared of needles. We have seen all of these factors play out in past epidemics. We examined the response to polio and the H1N1 vaccines in Canada. At the height of the epidemics, Canadians were keen to get vaccinated, but vaccine enthusiasm waned once the crisis had passed. The case of polio Parents were terrified by polio in the early decades of the 20th century. Usually striking in the otherwise carefree summer months, polio could leave children paralyzed. In some cases children were confined in iron lungs and in the very worst cases, death. The first trial of the Salk polio vaccine took place in the United States in 1954, using a vaccine produced in Toronto’s Connaught Laboratories. The vaccine proved highly effective. Other laboratories were licensed to product the vaccine, but one of them, the Cutter Laboratories, failed to properly de-activate the polio virus and 10 children died from polio. The U.S. halted the vaccination program on May 7, 1955. In Canada, a trial using the vaccine produced at the Connaught Laboratories continued. Health officials assured Canadians that the Connaught Laboratories product was safe and effective. By June 1956, 1.8 million Canadian children had been vaccinated. But this did not eradicate polio — there were significant epidemics in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A photo of a man in an iron lung from July 1957. (Library and Archives Canada), CC BY The Salk vaccine schedule required three separate doses, making it a challenge to complete the full course of vaccination. Many adults believed that polio only impacted children and were reluctant to take the vaccine. Only 10 per cent of Canadian adults had received the required three doses of the Salk vaccine by June of 1959, compared to a rate of 90 per cent among school-aged children. The year 1959 was one of the worst years for polio in Canada, with nearly 2,000 paralytic cases. In Montréal there were over 950 cases and 51 fatalities. Across Canada, more young adults died than children between the ages of five and 19, most of the cases occurring among those who had not been vaccinated. During the 1959 epidemic people swamped the vaccination clinics in Montréal. And three years later, following an outbreak in Hull, Que., residents came to the vaccination clinics in droves. Introduction of oral vaccine The introduction of the oral polio vaccine (Sabin vaccine) in 1961 led to an uptick in polio vaccinations. In just three months in 1962, over four million Canadians received the oral polio vaccine. Many adults who had resisted earlier appeals to get the Salk vaccine showed up to sip the tasteless Sabin vaccine, often served on a sugar cube. Newspapers raved that no needles were necessary. And by the 1970s, polio had all but disappeared in Canada. When the Salk vaccine came out, parents were very keen to have their children vaccinated, but young adults were not convinced that they were at risk and did not get vaccinated. Only after additional epidemics showed that that they too could die or be paralyzed by polio did adults turn up to get vaccinated. The vaccination effort was further aided by tasty Sabin vaccine. People lined up to get their H1N1 vaccination in Oct. 2009 in St. Eustache Que. Waiting times of seven hours were common as vaccination centres were overwhelmed by the demand. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz H1N1 vaccination campaign In spring of 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza virus began spreading in Mexico. The first cases were reported in Canada that April. In June, the World Health Organization declared H1N1 to be a global pandemic. Like the flu of 1918-19, which killed as many as 50 million people around the world, the 2009 flu had a disproportionate impact on younger people. That fall, vaccination clinics opened across Canada for priority groups. Early polls showed that only one-third of Canadians planned to get the H1N1 vaccine, which was on par with seasonal flu shot vaccination rates. Less than perfect efficacy rates of the seasonal flu shot did little to inspire the Canadian public to seek out the H1N1 vaccine. But four days after vaccination clinics opened in Ontario, a previously healthy boy in Toronto died. The tragic news stirred fear among Ontarians, prompting thousands to rush to clinics. Many waited in line for hours, while others were turned away. Vaccines became available to all Ontarians in November 2009, but by then, people’s fears had eased — it seemed that H1N1 was not as lethal as had originally been feared. Ultimately, between 40 and 45 per cent of the Canadian population was vaccinated against H1N1. Once again, vaccine enthusiasm was high in the middle of the crisis, but it diminished after the flu appeared to be less dangerous. Lessons for COVID-19 Polio and H1N1 reveal the complexities of vaccine enthusiasm. People rush to get vaccines when they perceive an immediate health risk to themselves or their family members. But without that fear, it is easier to delay or avoid getting vaccinated. Many Canadians know someone who has gotten sick from COVID-19 and many have lost friends and family members to the disease. It’s no wonder we are eager to get vaccinated. But enthusiasm may wane as case counts fall. If it proves that we need boosters, but case counts are low, will people make the same effort to get out to the vaccine clinics? The biggest challenge may be ensuring the continuing uptake of vaccines once the initial crisis has passed. In addition to measures to combat vaccine misinformation, public health authorities need to ensure that vaccines are readily available and convenient to access.

Spanish ‘Flu of 1918-19 led to high mortality in Mayo Asylum Many parallels with present day Covid pandemic Published: Sun 27 Jun 2021, 9:12 AM Last updated: Sun 27 Jun 2021, 9:13 AM DURING this current Covid-19 pandemic, it is not unexpected that we hear frequent reference to the Spanish or Great ‘Flu of 1918-19, given the many parallels that exist between the two outbreaks. The Spanish ‘Flu occurred towards the end of WWI and it is estimated to have been responsible for 50 million or more deaths worldwide, which was far more than resulted from the war itself. Ireland, like the rest of the world at that time, did not go untouched by that pandemic where it is estimated to have claimed over 20,000 lives. Review of contemporaneous records for that period show that the effects of the Spanish ‘Flu were keenly felt within the walls of the local Castlebar District Lunatic Asylum (DLA), later known as St. Mary’s Hospital and now home to the Headquarters of the Mayo Mental Health Service and the Galway Mayo Institute of Technology. By 1918, when influenza hit Co. Mayo, the Castlebar District Lunatic Asylum, which opened 155 years ago in April 1866, had been in existence for just over 50 years. Prior to then, people from Mayo who required treatment for a mental illness had been sent to the Ballinasloe Asylum. When it opened in 1866, it had accommodation for 260 patients. Over the years the numbers gradually increased and the building was expanded, initially by putting on a third storey and in 1902, after the opening of the asylum church, the original chapel was converted into accommodation for patients. Prior to 1918, there had been plans to convert part of the nearby prison into asylum accommodation but this plan never actually materialised. So, by 1918, when the ‘flu hit, there was accommodation for about 600 patients in a building which was clearly overcrowded and housed 800 patients. In recent times we have learned about the importance of social distancing, good hygiene, frequent hand washing, wearing of masks and good ventilation in combating the spread of Covid-19. We also know how it spreads more easily and had a devastating effect on some nursing homes, particularly where patients did not have access to single rooms. So, 100 years ago, when the ‘flu arrived in the Castlebar Asylum, where there was gross overcrowding, it is not difficult to understand how it easily spread. At that time, patients were accommodated in very large wards, with maybe up to 50 beds, in a facility designed for far less, not to mention the absence of single rooms, en-suites and with only limited bathing facilities. Besides the overcrowding, another factor, which although may not have directly led to the spread of the ‘flu but would certainly not have helped, were the unhygienic conditions that prevailed due to the unsatisfactory sewage disposal. This problem had existed for the previous three decades. Apparently, the sewage from Spencer Street flowed into the back of the asylum grounds and despite several representations made by the Board of Governors to the local Urban Council, requesting that this be corrected, the problem continued to exist well beyond 1918. However, despite these problems, it is worth noting that when the asylum was inspected only a few months earlier before the arrival of influenza, it was found to function well and the Report of the Inspectors mentioned “the general condition of the wards and dormitories throughout the asylum was most satisfactory” and “the health of the institution was excellent”. Yet, within a few months, the health of the patients had changed drastically. By mid-October 1918, just before the outbreak of the ‘flu, management had to resort to using turf as the fuel for the asylum as there was a serious shortage of coal. However, given that there was great difficulty sourcing a supply of turf locally, consideration was given to cutting back the heating, cooking and washing facilities which perhaps possibly contributed further to the misery of life in the asylum during the influenza outbreak. The devastating impact that the ‘flu had on both the patients and staff is well documented in the reports of Dr. Ellison, the doctor in charge, for the latter two months of 1918, to the Board of Governors, sometimes referred to as the Committee. In November, 1918, when reporting on the state of the asylum, he wrote, “This institution is at this moment, passing through a crisis without parallel in its history. “For the past ten days, Influenza in a most virulent and intensified form has stricken down the staff and patients. Up to this moment, close on one hundred male patients and about forty female patients have contracted the disease, while more than three fourths of staff are laid up and totally incapacitated from duty. “Fourteen male patients have so far lost their lives chiefly from the results of septic pneumonia and many others are dangerously ill. “With nearly one hundred and fifty persons ill and with less than one fourth of the staff available to look after them, not to mention the supervision of 800 inmates, the Committee will recognise the tremendous difficulties and dangers that have to be faced by the few who are left to do duty. “The working of the asylum has necessarily been completely disorganised, while the remaining members of the staff are exhausted and worn out.” Dr. Ellison’s account of staff shortages echoes what occurred during the current (Covid) pandemic when, in 2020, some nursing homes experienced staff shortages. Dr. Ellison attempted to employ temporary staff but reported “nurses are nowhere to be had… it is therefore quite impossible to give that care and attention to the sick that their condition so urgently calls for. “Those of the staff who have so far resisted the disease are making extraordinary and highly commendable efforts to carry out the impossible.” This is again somewhat similar to what happened a century later during this Covid-19 pandemic. By mid-December, 1918, Dr. Ellison reported on how matters had deteriorated even further. “Altogether over 200 patients were ill, of whom about forty died chiefly from pneumonia. Three female attendants died from this disease contracted in the asylum services. At one period, there were out of a total staff of 78 only 12 persons on duty….at one time only four members of the female staff out of a total of 27 were available for duty…these had to work by day and night to maintain even a semblance of supervision.” Similar to the proposals today to acknowledge and reward the efforts and hard work of frontline staff who worked tirelessly and at times risked their own life during this Covid-19, back in 1918 there was a proposal “to give each of the attendants a week’s holidays and also commend their services for special consideration”. The Board of Governors subsequently acknowledged their efforts and reference was made to “the real heroism on the part of staff” and they were rewarded with time off and monetary reward. It is interesting to note that by mid-January 1919, three months after the outbreak began, it was reported “the epidemic has now abated but has left its mark on many of those who survived”. Several members of the staff were still unable to return to duty, in consequence of the physical prostration which resulted from the illness. One wonders was this inability to return to work caused by the equivalent of Long Covid, the debilitating condition that we are learning more about today. Forty-seven patients, along with three members of staff, died from ‘flu during the last two weeks of November and early December 1918. Unlike this current pandemic, which has been harder on the elderly, those most adversely affected by Spanish ‘Flu worldwide were young and likewise those who died as a result of it in the Castlebar DLA during 1918 also tended to be young, the majority being in their 20s and 30s. Some had been in hospital for several years but others had only been admitted in the previous few months. It was particularly moving to find that two young brothers, both of whom had only been admitted earlier that year, died from the ‘flu within days of each other. One cannot begin to imagine what it was like for their devastated mother to get such news. Reports about the influenza were widely covered in newspapers of the time. One such report, in The Connaught Telegraph, on Saturday, December 7, 1918, mentioned how “in Castlebar it was very severe and as was to be expected the mortality in the asylum was great, but it has practically died out there”. Meanwhile, it is curious to note, “in the Castlebar Workhouse there is a large number of patients but the deaths have been comparatively small”. One wonders why there should have been more deaths in the asylum when compared with the equally overcrowded workhouse? It is also reported that “it (epidemic) is abating” even though at that time, patients in the asylum were still dying. One could question if this reflected a disconnect between what was happening in the asylum and the wider society. Three female staff in the asylum, referred to as Attendants, also lost their lives to influenza. At the December meeting of the Board of Governors, the three attendants who died were commended and as a gesture to show their work in the service was appreciated, it was mentioned that the cost of the coffins supplied in connection with the funerals of the three attendants be defrayed by the committee. The deaths of the three nurses, Ms. Katie Gavin, Ms. O’Beirne and Ms. Rainey, were reported in that same edition of The Connaught Telegraph while sadly there is no mention of any of the large number of patients who died. Neither do we have any records of their funerals nor where they were buried. We are aware that many patients, as was the custom at the time, were buried in unmarked graves in the asylum graveyard in Aglish. That same edition of The Connaught Telegraph showed the global impact of the influenza outbreak as it reported how it had sadly resulted in the death of three brothers from Castlebar who had emigrated to Philadelphia. Influenza was not mentioned in the minutes of the Board of Governors for February, 1919. However, it had raised its head again by March and on 21st, March, 1919, when a third wave occurred, it was reported “a few cases of influenza have occurred amongst the patients…the disease is of a milder type than was present during the November epidemic”. There were no deaths from influenza recorded during March. It is mentioned again three months later, in June 1919, when 15 patients as opposed to the usual 10 or so had died during the previous month. While there were no deaths directly recorded from Influenza, Dr. Ellison, referring to the previous month, remarked “the death rate was unusually high. Many of these were cases that failed to shake off the effects of the Influenza epidemic”. After June 1919, there was no further mention of that epidemic. So, in the same way as this current Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on our elderly population, particularly those in residential care, so too the Spanish ‘Flu similarly took its toll but on a younger group of patients in the Castlebar Asylum during the latter months of 1918. Yet, it is encouraging to note that after a few months, there is no further reference to the influenza epidemic in the asylum records. So, in terms of parallels, would that in the next few months, Covid-19 might mirror this pattern. (Article written and researched by the members of the St. Mary's Heritage Committee, June 2021). This memorial to the patients of St. Mary's Hospital who died from Spanish Flu was erected at their burial ground at Aglish, Castlebar, some years ago by members of the St. Mary's Heritage Committee.
