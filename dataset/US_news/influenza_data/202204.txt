This study aimed to identify key variables associated with strain-specific antibody responses in COPD patients and healthy older people. 76 COPD and 72 healthy participants were recruited from two Australian centres and inoculated with influenza vaccine. Serum strain-specific antibody titres were measured pre- and post-inoculation. Seroconversion rate was the primary endpoint. Antibody responses varied between vaccine strains. The highest rates of seroconversion were seen with novel strains (36–55%), with lesser responses to strains included in the vaccine in more than one consecutive year (27–33%). Vaccine responses were similar in COPD patients and healthy participants. Vaccine strain, hypertension and latitude were independent predictors of seroconversion. Our findings reassure that influenza vaccination is equally immunogenic in COPD patients and healthy older people; however, there is room for improvement. There may be a need to personalise the yearly influenza vaccine, including consideration of pre-existing antibody titres, in order to target gaps in individual antibody repertoires and improve protection.

COPD is the third leading cause of mortality worldwide2 with the global disease burden likely to increase substantially in coming years3,4. Common respiratory viruses such as rhinoviruses and influenza often trigger COPD exacerbations5,6, and can lead to secondary bacterial infections, hospitalisations and death7. Clinical guidelines recommend influenza vaccination as a priority for COPD patients and other high-risk populations including the elderly and immune compromised8. However, vaccine efficacy may be sub-optimal in these high-risk populations, either because of age-related immune dysfunction known as immunosenescence9,10,11,12, or because of disease-specific deficits in anti-viral immunity13,14.Vaccines act by inducing antibody production and long-lived memory B cells, however, influenza vaccine efficacy can be less than ideal15. Post-vaccination, influenza antibody titres decline relatively quickly, particularly in the elderly16,17, so annual vaccination is required. Additionally, the influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) and neuramidase surface proteins exhibit a high propensity for antigenic drift and evasion of host antibodies18, so vaccine formulations require updating annually. Strain selection for the vaccine each year is usually based on knowledge of strains circulating in the opposite hemisphere’s winter19.Recent systematic reviews have concluded that influenza vaccination is probably beneficial in COPD, though evidence gaps remain5, with relatively few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) directly assessing whether influenza vaccination reduces COPD exacerbations20. The largest RCT in the last 50 years was conducted in predominantly vaccine naïve participants. Though this study showed that influenza vaccination reduced COPD exacerbations relative to placebo, it is notable that the active intervention group received double the recommended vaccine dose21. In contrast, we previously reported that the humoral immune response to influenza vaccination may be sub-optimal in COPD13. There is considerable lack of knowledge regarding the immune response to influenza vaccine in COPD patients—whether the current vaccine strategy is sufficiently immunogenic and whether subgroups of patients fail to mount a robust antibody response. Addressing these knowledge gaps is necessary for developing better vaccine strategies for COPD patients and other at-risk populations.The aim of this study was to examine vaccine immunogenicity in COPD patients and age-matched healthy older people, in order to identify key variables associated with strain-specific antibody responses. The primary study endpoint was seroconversion, defined as ≥four-fold increase in haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titre at 28 days post-inoculation (p.i.). Seroprotection, (defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as an HI antibody titre ≥1:40) was a secondary endpoint. Notably, this study was not designed to assess whether vaccination reduces the incidence of influenza infections or COPD exacerbations.ResultsInfluenza vaccine formulations were based on Australian Government recommendations and differed slightly across the study years 2015-2017 (Table 1). The H1N1_A/CALIFORNIA/07/2009-like and B_PHUKET/3073/2013-like strains were components in the approved vaccine formulation in all three years of this study, enabling greater statistical power in assessing responses to these strains. A quadrivalent vaccine formulation in 2016 and 2017 added a second B strain (Brisbane/60/2008-like) to the previous trivalent vaccine. One strain differed each year, usually an H3N2 or H1N1 strain.Table 1 WHO-recommended southern-hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations for trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines for each vaccine year.Full size tableParticipant characteristicsParticipant demographics are shown in Table 2. The mean age of COPD participants was 3.8 years higher than that of healthy participants (p < 0.01), and just under 70% of COPD participants were male, whereas the healthy participants comprised similar numbers of females and males. Compared with healthy participants, COPD patients had significantly greater cumulative smoke exposure (pack years), were more likely to be current smokers, and more likely to report physician-diagnosed comorbidities, such as asthma and bronchiectasis. Over 90% of our study population received an influenza vaccine in at least one of the two years prior to enrolment. Population demographics were analogous across the Brisbane and Melbourne study sites (Supplementary Table 1).Table 2 Demographics and clinical characteristics of the study population: Comparative between COPD and older healthy participants.Full size tableNine subjects participated in the study in consecutive years (2015 and 2016), and another nine participated in both 2016 and 2017. No subjects participated in three consecutive years. Because the influenza vaccine formulation varies by year and because clinical characteristics may fluctuate over time, these ‘repeat participants’ were analysed as individual subjects within each participating year.Vaccine-induced antibody response vary by strainWe compared day 28 p.i. seroconversion rates for those strains included in the vaccine formulation in more than one consecutive year (hereafter referred to as ‘recurring strains’), contrasting this with vaccine strains that were ‘novel’ to a vaccine season (Fig. 1). Notably, a greater proportion of subjects seroconverted to novel strains in a particular year, compared with the recurring strains present in the vaccine formulation every year. For example, the recurring H1N1/California strain and both B vaccine strains of Brisbane and Phuket, elicited seroconversion in 27%, 32% and 31.9% of study participants respectively, whereas the novel strains used in each vaccine season (H3N2/Hong Kong, H1N1/Michigan and H3N2/Switzerland), elicited seroconversion in a larger proportion of study participants: 54%, 36% and 48%, respectively. These differences in seroconversion were statistically significant for H3N2/Hong Kong and H3N2/Switzerland, but not H1N1/Michigan.Fig. 1: Proportion of subjects that seroconverted (≥ 4-fold rise in Ab titre from D0).Data displayed as proportion ± standard error of fit. Red bars: recurring strains (present in vaccine ≥2 seasons), blue bars: novel strains in vaccine season. **significant difference (p < 0.001) to all recurring strains (H1N1/California, B/Phuket & B/Brisbane), #significant difference (p < 0.05) to recurring strain H1N1/California only. Significance between proportions calculated by Yates’ Chi-square test.Full size imageAlthough the magnitude of post-vaccine antibody response varies considerably between strains, all strains elicited a significantly higher post-vaccine geometric mean titre (GMT) than their corresponding pre-vaccine GMT (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the post-vaccine GMT for all strains increased above 1:40, demonstrating seroprotection. The high pre-vaccine GMT, seen in both B strains and the novel strain H3N2/Hong Kong, indicates that our cohort already exhibited strain-specific seroprotection prior to vaccination. Interestingly, the two novel H3N2 vaccine strains (H3N2/Hong Kong & H3N2/Switzerland) induced greater degrees of post-vaccine seroprotection, with H3N2/Hong Kong also eliciting a higher GMT, than the recurring strains (Fig. 2), signifying that these two novel vaccine strains were particularly efficacious.Fig. 2: Antibody response pre- (D0) and post- (D28) vaccine for each strain.Data is expressed as GMT ± 95% confidence intervals. Temporal differences for each strain are considered significant if confidence intervals (CI) do not overlap. Dotted horizontal line represents a GMT of 1:40, indicative of seroprotection. GMT: geometric mean titre.Full size imageComparative seroconversion and seroprotection ratesAntibody responses to the various vaccine strains were broadly similar in the COPD and healthy participants. Few differences are observed between COPD and healthy participants in either pre- or post-vaccine seroprotection, or in GMT (Table 3). Vaccine strain B/Phuket elicited a significantly higher seroconversion rate in COPD patients than in healthy participants (adjusted OR p = 0.038), and COPD patients had higher pre- and post-vaccine GMT to vaccine strain A/Hong Kong than healthy participants. These differences were not seen with the other strains.Table 3 Vaccine response pre- (D0) and post- (D28) vaccine: Seroprotection rate, Seroconversion rates, and GMT for each vaccine strain.Full size tableWe further assessed whether strain-specific antibody responses varied by study location (Supplementary Table 2). Melbourne participants tended to have higher post-vaccine seroprotection rates and GMT than Brisbane participants, though differences were only significant for the H1N1/California strain (p = 0.03, adjOR p = 0.029 and GMT p ≤ 0.001). The H1N1/California strain also elicited a significantly higher seroconversion rate (p = 0.19, adjOR p = 0.012) in Melbourne relative to Brisbane participants. Melbourne participants also had higher pre-vaccine seroprotection rates for the P/Phuket (p = 0.038) strain and higher pre-vaccine GMT for the H3N2/Hong Kong strain (p = 0.031).Antibody responses were largely similar in women and men (Supplementary Table 3). Pre-vaccination antibody titres to the H1N1/California strain were significantly lower in women than in men, but this difference was not statistically significant after vaccination.Regression analyses of antibody responsesMultiple logistic regression analyses indicated that vaccine year, vaccine strain, and study site were all independently associated with the ability to seroconvert at day 28 p.i. (Supplementary Table 4a). Of note, disease status (COPD or healthy) was not independently associated with seroconversion or post-vaccine seroprotection.Although vaccine strain and year were identified as factors independently associated with seroconversion and seroprotection (Supplementary Table 4a and b, respectively), analysis of the interaction between vaccine strain and year demonstrated that the variation from one year to another could largely be attributed to vaccine strain, with some strains exhibiting collinearity with year (Supplementary Table 9).Unadjusted univariate linear models suggest that the magnitude of the fold increase in post-vaccine antibody levels was negatively correlated with baseline antibody levels (p < 0.0001), and positively correlated with body mass index (BMI; p < 0.0001), (Supplementary Table 5). Contrary to expectations, current smoking and total pack years were not associated with seroconversion, whereas cumulative passive smoke exposure was positively associated with ability to seroconvert (Supplementary Table 6).We also assessed whether any self-reported comorbidities were associated with seroconversion or seroprotection including asthma, bronchiectasis, hypertension, high cholesterol, heart conditions and diabetes. generalised linear model (GLM) analysis indicated that hypertension was the only comorbidity associated with vaccine responses: those with hypertension showed a greater ability to seroconvert (p = 0.0491) than those without hypertension (Supplementary Table 7a). However, hypertension was not associated with post-vaccine seroprotection (Supplementary Table 7b).Participants from Melbourne were more likely to seroconvert than participants from Brisbane (p = 0.0178; Supplementary Table 4a) and had a greater likelihood of attaining seroprotection after vaccination (p = 0.0130) (Supplementary Table 4b). As noted above, Brisbane and Melbourne study participants had similar demographic and clinical features (Supplementary Table 1).Baseline neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil numbers in whole blood were significantly greater in COPD patients than in healthy participants (Supplementary Fig. 1). However, GLM analysis indicated that these leucocyte populations were not associated with seroconversion or seroprotection at D28 p.i. (Supplementary Table 8a and b, respectively).DiscussionWe examined immune responses to the seasonal influenza vaccine in COPD patients and healthy elderly people, most of whom had previously been vaccinated. The major finding to emerge was the extent to which vaccine strain was a key independent predictor of seroconversion. The greatest degrees of seroconversion were seen for novel vaccine strains, whereas lesser responses were seen with recurring vaccine strains. Contrary to our expectations, there was no evidence that COPD patients had sub-optimal vaccine responses relative to healthy older participants.We have shown that while many participants had high existing antibody titres, indicating they were already protected against certain strains, vaccinating with the same influenza strains in consecutive years failed to significantly augment the antibody response, whereas vaccinating with novel strains was more likely to induce the desired outcome of seroconversion. For example, while study participants showed pre-vaccination GMT at or above the level of protection (HI titre ≥ 40) for both B/ antigens, relatively few individuals seroconverted to these strains. In contrast, the novel H3N2 strains stimulated greater seroconversion rates relative to recurring strains. Similarly, a previous systematic review and meta-analysis has also shown that influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) can differ greatly by subtype22. Tsang et al.14 conducted a systems biological approach in healthy adults, in order to develop models that predict responses to influenza perturbation. They discovered that subjects with higher initial titres had lower fold changes at day 70 post-vaccine, also suggesting this inverse correlation may be due to, along with other factors, inhibitory responses in pre-immune subjects23. Although older adults in general conventionally respond poorly to influenza vaccines in comparison to younger adults24, our study demonstrated that older adults can be more responsive to influenza strains to which they have not been exposed to in preceding years. Others have observed similar trends in adults, whereby participants had relatively high pre-vaccination HI titres but lower rises in post-vaccination HI titres after repeated vaccination, compared with first-time vaccine recipients25. Andrew et al. proposed that pre-existing antibodies mask de novo antibody responses, and Huang et al. further suggested that pre-existing antigen-specific antibodies might mask viral epitopes and thereby reduce the magnitude of secondary antibody response to repeated influenza exposure25,26. Similarly, Nuñezet al. reported that the impact of pre-existing immunity on responses to influenza vaccination differed between older and younger subjects27. It is, however, recognised that older adults are more likely to have been previously exposed to influenza through contact with the virus or vaccination, which can provide a protective effect to influenza via broadly cross-reactive existing cellular immunity28,29,30.Greater than 90% of our study participants received the influenza vaccine in at least one of the two years prior to our study, and were thus an antigen-experienced population. Participants at this life stage are likely to have previously been exposed to a number of wild-type influenza viral infections, which are known to induce more sustained protection to specific strains than vaccination31 and may account for the high pre-vaccine HI levels observed in our study. Evidence from large datasets suggests that repeated vaccination does not impact on the ability of influenza vaccines to reduce hospitalisations due to influenza32. A meta-analysis of data from children and adults has also shown no support for a reduction in VE of two consecutive influenza vaccines, however, there is some evidence from this study that serial vaccination from greater than two consecutive seasons may have negative impact on protection33. Additionally, high pre-vaccine antibody levels have been shown to reduce the incidence of influenza infections in the elderly34.The COPD cohort in our study included more males, was slightly older, and had more current and prior smoke exposure than the healthy cohort. Despite the demographics not being completely matched between study groups, we observed no significant difference in HI titre, for any strain, between healthy and COPD groups. This is contrary to our previous pilot study, which found lower post-vaccine HI titres to H1N1 antigen in COPD patients compared to healthy participants35. The disparity in VE between these two studies may be due the small size of the pilot study, or a mismatch in vaccine antigens in some years, which would reduce ability to mount a suitable immune response in those years36. We have also shown herein that disease status (COPD or healthy), current smoking and comorbid disease (aside from hypertension), were not associated with the efficacy of the influenza vaccine, whether assessed by seroconversion or seroprotection. Other studies report similar findings: VE in one older population was not associated with comorbid disease36, while another study reported that VE in an elderly, vaccine-naïve population was not associated with COPD severity, age, gender and current smoking status21. Given our study population was restricted to a relatively narrow, older range, it is perhaps not surprising that we observed no association between VE and age.Interestingly, cumulative exposure to passive smoke was positively associated with ability to seroconvert which is unexpected, considering that current smoking and cumulative pack years were not associated with any outcome measures in this study. Further studies in larger cohorts are needed.Melbourne study participants were more likely to seroconvert than Brisbane study participants, with no demographic or clinical differences between participants from these two large Australian cities. One report suggested that influenza outbreaks are more intense in regions with small population sizes and higher humidity37, while others have shown various environmental factors including temperature, humidity and pollution influence the incidence of influenza38,39. Given the climatic differences between Brisbane (latitude 27.4° south: sub-tropical) and Melbourne (latitude 37.8° south: temperate), it is possible that differences in key environmental factors such as pollution, sunlight exposure and vitamin D status may impact individual immune response to vaccines40. These observations are interesting and warrant further investigations in larger cohorts.We acknowledge that our study has limitations. The choice of vaccine formulation in each year is regulated by the Australian government, making it difficult to compare specific vaccine strain responses across multiple years. Although we were able to compare longitudinal data for some strains, this was not possible for those strains occurring only in one vaccine season. Accordingly, our study may be slightly underpowered for evaluating these novel strains. We considered combining responses from different years for H1 strains and H3 strains, as per McElhaney et al.41 and Nunzi et al.42, however, we did not use this approach due to the clear variability in reactivity between strains. Circulating strains of influenza vary each year, making it difficult to interpret pre- and post-vaccine HI titres, particularly in regard to cross-reactivity between strains. Furthermore, relying on vaccine-induced antibody response as a correlate of protection against influenza disregards important changes in cellular immunity and enhanced vaccine-mediated protection against influenza in the elderly11,43. Data presented in this manuscript are not yet comprehensive enough to allow us to determine the mechanisms involved in such varied response to the chosen annual vaccine strains, yet we speculate that potential mechanisms such as accelerated immunosenescence play a critical role44. We continue to look at the underlying mechanisms contributing to poor influenza vaccine responsiveness, and are currently analysing additional data from this study, including strain-specific B cell induction. This is an area of current research in our laboratories. Our study was not powered to evaluate the longer-term benefits of influenza vaccination on COPD exacerbations, though it is important that future studies address this issue. Despite these limitations, our study provides important insights into influenza vaccine responses in healthy older and COPD populations over time, and how these differ for each vaccine antigen.In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, concern has been raised regarding the co-circulation of seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2, particularly in vulnerable populations. The overall risk to health and mortality is higher with SARS-CoV-2 than influenza, and it appears that co-infection elicits no worse symptoms than having SARS-CoV-2 alone45,46. A study conducted by the national Veterans Health Administration (USA) has, however, indicated the risks for exacerbations of asthma and COPD in this older population to be higher in patients hospitalised with influenza compared with SARS-CoV-246. As the simultaneous circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza strains continues to be a threat to health, it becomes more important for greater uptake of the annual influenza vaccine in these at-risk groups. The capacity to reduce hospitalisations due to COPD exacerbations and other influenza induced indications, alleviating services to better cope with COVID-19 complications, is not insignificant47,48.A central finding of this study is that previous exposure to a specific influenza strain limits the subsequent magnitude of response, or “boosting” ability, to that strain in ensuing seasonal vaccines. Based on seroprotection rates alone, the COPD patients and healthy older participants in our study may appear to be relatively well protected against influenza. However, the findings of Camilloni et al. sound a note of caution in this regard: High rates of infection were seen in an immunised elderly population exposed to mismatched influenza B viruses, even though vaccination had significantly boosted HI titres of cross-reactive antibodies49. Although participants in Camilloni et al.’s study were all residing in nursing homes and characteristically frail individuals with potential additional health impacts, concern regarding high rates of viral infection in individuals that still elicit reasonable antibody levels may be extrapolated to immunocompromised individuals such as those with COPD49. Furthermore, the rate of decline in antibody titres after vaccination remains troubling, particularly in the elderly where clinical protection is not likely to persist year-round50. Recent studies have demonstrated that antibody titres in the elderly are only elevated for 48-56 days after vaccination with the annual, trivalent, split-virus influenza vaccine, consisting of two A strains and one B strain, and may not be further increased by a second booster of this same vaccine21.In conclusion, while our findings provide reassurance that influenza vaccination is immunogenic in both COPD patients and healthy older people, there is clearly room for further improvement. Our findings raise the issue of whether the influenza vaccine should be personalised each year based on pre-existing antibody titres in order to target vaccine formulations to fill gaps in individual antibody repertoires. Moving towards a more individualised seasonal approach, instead of the current blanket recommendation across the population, might increase the efficacy of the influenza vaccine each year, and reduce the burden of influenza in vulnerable groups such as COPD patients. This approach warrants formal testing in well-designed clinical trials.MethodsStudy population, ethical and regulatory approvalsThis non-randomised, unblinded, observational study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki Principles and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Code of Practice. Ethical approval was granted from local ethics committees: Metro South Health Human Research Committee (approval number: HREC/09/QPAH/297) and The University of Queensland Human Ethics Research Office (approval number: 2011000502). All participants provided written informed consent prior to enrolment.Eligible participants aged at or greater than 50 years were recruited from hospitals in two large Australians cities (Brisbane and Melbourne) between 2015 and 2017. COPD patients had a current clinical diagnosis of mild-to-very-severe COPD, a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of <80% predicted, and an FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio <0.7, with no COPD exacerbations in the 28 days prior to enrolment, and stable medication use. Healthy participants were spouses or partners of COPD patients or were recruited through advertising. A standardised clinical questionnaire was used for screening and assessment. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are further detailed in the Supplementary Methods. Patients reporting additional physician-diagnosed pulmonary diseases were eligible for inclusion provided COPD was the principal pulmonary diagnosis. The consort diagram shows the numbers recruited, screened and enroled in the study (Fig. 3).Fig. 3: Consort diagram for the study “Using influenza vaccination to understand and improve immune responses to vaccination in patients with COPD and healthy older people (IVC)”.A flow diagram of the progress through the phases of a non-randomised, unblinded, observational study.Full size imageStudy designRecruitment occurred between February and May each study year, prior to the southern-hemisphere winter. Clinical assessment questionnaire, blood collection and spirometry were performed at the first clinic visit (day 0), prior to intramuscular administration of a single standard dose of the seasonal inactivated, trivalent or quadrivalent, split-virion influenza vaccine (FluQuadri™, Sanofi Pasteur). The vaccine consisted of 15 μg HA of each strain without adjuvant: Table 1 lists the vaccine composition in each year. Study participants returned for further blood collection 28 days p.i. to determine serum antibody levels. Further information regarding study design can be found in the Supplementary Methods.ImmunogenicityHaemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were performed against components of each vaccine strain, following pre-treatment of sera with receptor-destroying enzyme, as per methods described by the World Health Organization51, and outlined in the Supplementary Methods. Seroconversion was defined as fourfold increase in antibody HI titre above 1:40 post-influenza vaccination, also known to be associated with a reduced risk of influenza infection52. Seroprotection was defined as a HI titre ≥1:40, an antibody level traditionally correlated with reduced risk of influenza infection53,54. Blood collection and sample processing are described in the Supplementary Methods. Baseline whole blood leucocyte counts were measured as standard of care.Statistical analysisDescriptive statistics were calculated separately for each vaccine strain. Vaccine responses were described as seroconversion and seroprotection rates and as back-transformed GMT. Participants who did not supply blood samples at both baseline and 28 days p.i. were excluded from the analysis. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Clinical correlations, GLMs and regression models were generated using R (version 4.0.2, 2020, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform, Vienna, Austria). Graphs were generated in R and GraphPad Prism, version 8.4.2 (464), (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA, www.graphpad.com).Clinical study registrationThis study is registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), under the title “Using influenza vaccination to understand and improve immune responses to vaccination in patients with COPD and healthy older people.” Registration number: ACTRN: ACTRN12620000830998.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

CDC Update January 27, 2022—The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspective Service (APHIS) recently announced the first detections of Asian highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 viruses in wild birds in the United States since 2016. Wild birds can carry HPAI A(H5N1) bird flu without showing symptoms, but these viruses can cause illness and death in domestic poultry. Human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) bird flu are rare but can occur, usually after close contact with infected birds. CDC considers the health risk to the general public from these recent Asian HPAI A(H5N1) wild bird flu infections to be low at this time. On the animal health side, the U.S. Department of Interior and USDA are the lead federal departments for outbreak investigation and control in wild birds, and USDA APHIS is the lead agency for such activities in domestic birds. Since 2003, 19 countries have reported more than 860 total human infections with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses to the World Health Organization (WHO), with about 53 percent of those resulting in death. The most recent human infection with HPAI A(H5N1) was reported in the United Kingdom in January 2022 in association with exposure to domestically kept infected birds. No human infections associated with HPAI A(H5N1) viruses have ever been identified in the United States to date. Infected birds shed avian influenza virus in their saliva, mucous and feces. Human infections with bird flu viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. People with close or prolonged unprotected contact with infected birds or contaminated environments may be at greater risk of infection. Illnesses in humans from avian influenza virus infections have ranged in severity from mild to severe. The spread of avian influenza A viruses from one sick person to another is very rare, and when it has happened, it has not led to sustained spread among people. While CDC considers the current risk to the general public from these HPAI A(H5N1) detections in wild birds to be low, it is important to remember that risk depends on exposure, and people with more exposure may have a greater risk of infection. Guidance varies based on potential exposure. There is existing federal guidance around bird flu exposures for different groups of people, including hunters [297 KB, 2 pages], poultry producers and the general public, as well as health care providers. As a reminder, it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry in the United States. The proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165˚F kills bacteria and viruses, including HPAI viruses. CDC will provide updates on this situation as needed.

(photo credit: REUTERS/PETER NICHOLLS) Two additional wild birds have been found to be infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus in South and North Carolina, the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) announced on Tuesday.The two birds were found to be infected just days after a wild American wigeon was found to be infected with the virus in Colleton County, South Carolina, the first case of Eurasian H5 avian influenza in the US since 2016. Other variants of the bird flu have been detected in the US in recent years.APHIS added that it expects to find further cases among wild birds and advised people to avoid having direct contact with wild birds. The service urged farmers and hunters to practice good biosecurity to prevent the spread of the virus. The USDA added that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still considers the risk to the general public from the variant to be low. No human infections from the variant have occurred in the US.In the UK, one person was infected with the H5N1 variant earlier this month and has since recovered without experiencing severe illness. The patient had close contact with ducks. Workers in protective gear seen in Moshav Givat Yoav, in northern Israel, December 29, 2021, following an outbreak of the Avian influenza. (credit: MICHAEL GILADI/FLASH90)In China, a spike in the number of human infections caused by the H5N6 subvariant of the bird flu has been recorded in the past year. One new case of human infection was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) between January 14 to 20.According to the WHO, the rise in H5N6 cases may reflect the continued circulation of the virus in birds and enhanced surveillance due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The WHO added that the zoonotic threat remains elevated due to the spread of the viruses among birds, but that the overall pandemic risk associated with the strain of bird flu has not significantly changed. The increase in human infections caused by the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza is causing concern among experts, who say that a previously circulating strain appears to have changed and could be more infectious to people."The increase in human cases in China this year is of concern. It's a virus that causes high mortality," said Thijs Kuiken, professor of comparative pathology at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, to Reuters in October.A large number of bird flu outbreaks have been reported throughout Europe, Africa and Asia in recent weeks, mostly due to the H5N1 subtype, which comes from the H5 lineage, according to the World Organization for Animal Health. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now Over a million birds were found to be infected with the variant in Israel in recent months, although Israel's Agriculture Ministry declared in recent weeks that the outbreak is now under control.The OIE has urged countries to increase surveillance for HPAI outbreaks, as the virus has been reported in over 40 countries since July.The H5N1, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6 and H5N8 subtypes of HPAI are circulating in bird and poultry populations across the globe, sparking concern at OIE which called this an “unprecedented genetic variability of subtypes... creating an epidemiologically challenging landscape.” Earlier this month, OIE Director General Monique Eloit told Reuters that "this time the situation is more difficult and more risky because we see more variants emerge, which make them harder to follow.""Eventually the risk is that it mutates or that it mixes with a human flu virus that can be transmitted between humans then suddenly it takes on a new dimension," she added.Germany’s Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, told the German Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) that Europe is experiencing its “strongest avian flu epidemic ever.”The institute added that “there is no end in sight” as the virus spreads throughout the continent and around the world, with new cases reported on a daily basis.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags United States health flu Assuta Health bird flu Hot Opinion Dear Jared Kushner, the Jewish people need you By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

Jan. 7, 2022 Listen and subscribe to our podcast: Via Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher Entering the third year of a deadly pandemic may have some Minnesotans wondering how things could possibly be worse. The final months of 1918 provide a sobering answer. An influenza pandemic began ravaging the state in the fall of that year — ultimately killing more than 10,000 Minnesotans. Meanwhile, young men were being sent off to a bloody world war overseas and wildfires were destroying entire cities in northern Minnesota. Reader Sarah Rasmussen moved into a 1917 Minneapolis home just before COVID-19 and realized they were not the first family to endure a pandemic within its walls. She wondered what life was like for those people a century ago. "They may not have set up a small gym in the basement, but maybe they saw friends in the backyard," Rasmussen wrote in an e-mail. She sought answers about life in Minnesota during the 1918 pandemic — and how it compares to today — from Curious Minnesota, the Star Tribune's reporting project fueled by great reader questions. National Museum of Health and Medicine via Associated Press Influenza patients at Fort Riley in Kansas in 1918. The deadly disease that began killing thousands in 1918 likely originated in Kansas, based on modern research. It quickly earned the nickname "Spanish influenza" because Spain was a neutral country in World War I and did not censor reports about the illness. After cropping up in military camps, it spread quickly due to the proximity and movement of troops during the war, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By the fall, social activities in Minnesota ground to a halt much as they did in spring 2020. Some cities shut down schools and canceled large events. Police broke up crowds in local saloons. The University of Minnesota delayed opening for the fall semester. "All the towns and cities for miles around are closed — everything but the meat markets, grocery and dry good stores," a young woman, LaVerne Roquette, wrote to her boyfriend overseas in October 1918. "At some places people have to wear gauze masks when they appear on the streets. … The government has closed all schools, churches, theatres." "That was written 104 years ago, but could have been yesterday," said Curt Brown, author of "Minnesota 1918: When Flu, Fire and War Ravaged the State." A former Star Tribune reporter, Brown still writes a weekly history column for the newspaper. Not everyone appreciated the precautions. Hennepin County Library Nicollet Avenue at 7th Street in 1918. Dr. H.M. Bracken, executive officer of the state board of health, was vociferously opposed to the school and business closures in Minneapolis. "If you begin to close, where are you going to stop? When are you going to reopen and what do you accomplish by opening?" Bracken told the Minneapolis City Council in October 1918. "Thus far, St. Paul has seen fit to follow my advice." About 10 days later, citing a surge in cases, St. Paul followed Minneapolis in shuttering everything from churches and schools to soda fountains and bowling alleys. Even government agencies were sparring over the new rules. The Minneapolis School Board tried to defy the city Health Department's closure order. The health commissioner responded by ordering the chief of police to close all school buildings and arrest anyone who tried to interfere. The schools, which had opened for half a day, were quickly closed again. Poorly understood disease The differences between the two pandemics largely outweigh the similarities, however, starting with the basic standards of living at the time. Cars were still a luxury item and home electricity wasn't guaranteed — particularly in rural areas.

"No one had radios in their homes. … They weren't getting barraged with total case numbers and death counts on social media and TV and radio," Brown said. "It was more word of mouth." In Minneapolis, mail carriers and Boy Scouts were dispatched to homes and businesses to deliver placards and literature on the spread of influenza. Newspapers offered regular guidance, but there was limited understanding of the disease. "Scientifically, they didn't even know what the influenza virus was until 1933," Brown said. "They thought it was bacteria." The Minneapolis City Council ordered that the street commissioners "sprinkle and flush" the streets with water, because "the bacillus of Spanish influenza lurked in the dust of the streets," according to a Minneapolis Morning Tribune article from October 1918. PODCAST Listen: Which Indigenous tribes first called Minnesota home? The Curious Minnesota podcast talks with professor Anton Treuer about the ancient human history of Minnesota. Some advice is familiar today. The assistant dean of the University of Minnesota medical school, Dr. Richard Beard, said at the time that the disease passed through particles "distributed by mouth or nose spray." To set an example, the Minneapolis Health Department eliminated the use of shared drinking cups and towels — and banned sneezing in the workplace. The importance of fresh air was regularly stressed. Beard advised that people should open streetcar windows, work in ventilated offices, avoid crowded places and "sleep as nearly as possible out of doors." Hospitals overrun Within weeks of the first case reported in Minneapolis, hospitals were overrun. U.S. Surgeon General Rupert Blue chastised the general public for relying too heavily on modern medical care. "The present generation has been spoiled by having had expert medical and nursing care readily available," Blue said. "I believe the public generally ... has not interested itself sufficiently in studying the home care of the sick." Testing wasn't available and treatment options were limited to prevention. It would be several decades before an influenza vaccine was available. "There were no intensive care units or respirators," Brown said. "Death from disease was less of a mind-blow than it is today. I think they were used to people dying of diseases like diphtheria and smallpox." Hennepin County Library A section of the 1919 West High School yearbook dedicated to graduates killed in World War I featured some former students who had died after contracting influenza in the military. Nursing staffs were stretched thin by the double crises of flu and war. Ambulances and hospitals in many cities were dedicated almost entirely to flu patients. In early November 1918, half the nurses at the City Hospital (now HCMC) in Minneapolis were out sick with influenza, and substitutes were hard to find since many were helping the war effort or wildfire victims. Sailors from a naval training station in Illinois were called in to attend flu patients in Minneapolis. Another place flu found fertile ground to spread was in the temporary housing set up for evacuees of the wildfires in northern Minnesota, says Brown. Historic wildfires in 1918 decimated entire cities and burned people and animals alive. Those who escaped the fast-moving blazes were packed into cramped housing or crowded hospitals. 'Trifecta of woe' The flu lingered through 1919 and into 1920, though it claimed the majority of its victims at the end of 1918. As with our current pandemic, it came in waves that spurred lockdowns and subsequent re-openings. University of Minnesota Duluth, Kathryn A. Martin Library People — many of them wearing masks — attend a relief event at the Duluth Armory in 1918, following the northern Minnesota wildfires. When a shutdown was lifted in Minneapolis in November 1918, the Minneapolis Tribune reported that crowds quickly jammed movie theaters and dance halls. "The passing throngs ... hesitated, still uncertain as to whether or not one huge joke was in the process of being perpetrated, walked up to the cashier's cage, and then, satisfied that it was all true, entered joyously," the Tribune reported about a movie theater. Roughly 12,000 Minnesotans ultimately died from the illness, Brown said, which is slightly more than have died so far from COVID-19. But Minnesota's population was less than half its current size, so proportionately the death toll was much larger. And unlike other outbreaks, an unusual number of healthy young adults succumbed to the 1918 flu. "Then you throw on this huge forest fire in the fall and the guys serving in World War I," Brown said, "it was a trifecta of woe."

Serology is the scientific study of blood to look at the response of the immune system to vaccination or infections with pathogens, like flu viruses. CDC Influenza Division’s human serology work supports the following objectives: Improving assessment and selection of candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) for use in producing seasonal flu vaccines. Increasing scientific understanding of the characteristics of the immune response following flu vaccination that are associated with immune protection (also known as “correlates of protection.”) Determining population immunity against circulating human seasonal flu viruses. Identifying asymptomatic or mild flu infections and improving the assessment of flu disease burden. Determining population immunity against zoonotic (animal-origin) flu viruses with pandemic potential. Improving the assessment and selection of CVVs for use in producing pre-pandemic flu vaccines Human serology work to improve assessment and selection of CVVs for producing seasonal flu vaccines CDC’s Influenza Division now uses human serology data to improve the selection of candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) for use in producing seasonal flu vaccines. Flu viruses are always changing and many different flu viruses of various types and subtypes circulate around the world and cause seasonal flu epidemics. All flu viruses undergo small genetic changes over time, and these genetic changes can result in antigenic changes that allow a flu virus to evade a person’s existing immunity from prior flu infection or vaccination. More information is available at How the Flu Virus Can Change. This is one reason why the composition of flu vaccines must be reviewed and updated and new vaccines produced prior to each flu season. The selection of CVVs for producing seasonal flu vaccines is made months prior to the start of the flu season in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. Twice a year, the World Health Organization (WHO) organizes a consultation with the seven WHO Collaborating Centers, Essential Regulatory Laboratories, and representatives from key national laboratories and academia to review available data and make recommendations on the composition of flu vaccines for the coming season. These WHO consultations are called vaccine composition meetings (VCM). VCM occurs in February to recommend the composition of Northern Hemisphere flu vaccines and in September to recommend the composition of Southern Hemisphere flu vaccines. For more information, visit Selecting Viruses for the Seasonal Flu Vaccine. Seasonal flu vaccines are designed to include CVVs that protect against the three or four (depending on vaccine) major flu virus groups (known as types, subtypes, and lineages) that often co-circulate during flu seasons. All available flu vaccines in the United States are quadrivalent (four-component) flu vaccines this season. Quadrivalent flu vaccines contain a flu A(H1N1)pdm09 component, a flu A(H3N2) component, a flu B/Yamagata lineage component, and a flu B/Victoria lineage component. Trivalent (three-component) flu vaccines contain only one flu type B virus. Therefore, three or four candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) are chosen for use in flu vaccine production. Research indicates if the flu virus representing each vaccine component needs to be updated with a new CVV. Human serology data contributes to the selection of CVVs for flu vaccines. Human serology data is now included in the overall body of data that CDC collects to inform WHO’s Northern and Southern Hemisphere flu vaccine composition recommendations. To obtain this serology data, CDC works with partner organizations to collect blood samples from people who received flu vaccines. The blood samples are collected during the flu season, and this work begins shortly after flu vaccines becomes available. Blood samples are collected from people prior to vaccination and then again about three weeks to four weeks post-vaccination to allow time for their bodies to develop antibodies. Antibodies are proteins made by a person’s immune system in response to infections or vaccination that can protect against future infections. Following vaccination, a person’s antibodies will rise over time and generally peak around 3-4 weeks post-vaccination. Antibody levels from vaccination can wane over time, generally over the course of several months post-vaccination before leveling off. Although antibodies wane, this does not mean they drop to zero. For purposes of serologic testing and analysis, laboratory scientists will take the blood samples collected from people and prepare sera from them. Serum (its plural form is sera) is a fluid component of blood from which blood clotting elements are removed. Sera contain antibodies and are used in serology tests. Serology tests, also known as antibody tests, are conducted on a person’s blood serum to look for the presence of antibodies. CDC collects blood samples from people of all age groups and from different geographic areas both before and after flu vaccination. After this blood is collected, CDC prepares sera from these blood samples to enable analysis of antibodies against circulating flu viruses. Laboratory tests including the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI test) and microneutralization assay, are commonly used for serology testing. The goal is to measure how well the antibodies elicited from flu vaccination can recognize and neutralize the flu viruses in circulation. If the antibodies produced from vaccination effectively neutralize circulating flu viruses, then it is likely that the current flu vaccine’s composition is suitable for protecting people during that flu season. This means that the flu vaccine’s composition does not need to be updated. In contrast, if the antibodies produced from vaccination do not effectively neutralize currently circulating flu viruses, then it is likely that one or more of the components of the flu vaccine will need to be updated. All of CDC’s human serology data collection and analysis is completed prior to the WHO VCM in order to contribute to the flu vaccine composition recommendations. How human serology data differs from the ferret sera used traditionally Scientists have traditionally used sera produced by ferrets inoculated with specific flu viruses to assess the similarity (match) or differences (mismatch) between the CVVs chosen for use in flu vaccines and the flu viruses that are in circulation. By testing antibodies found in human sera after flu vaccination, scientists can better determine whether the human immune response to the vaccine will sufficiently target and neutralize circulating flu viruses. The human immune response to flu vaccination can be different to that of ferrets. Ferrets used for this kind of testing are naïve to flu, meaning that they have never been infected with a flu virus or been vaccinated against flu. In contrast, humans – particularly older children and adults – often have had previous flu vaccinations or flu infections. These prior flu infections or vaccinations are known to affect the way the human immune system responds to future flu vaccinations or flu virus infections. For example, sometimes only antibodies contained in human sera (as opposed to ferret sera) can detect the antigenic differences between flu viruses. Also, sometimes people may respond differently to flu vaccination based on their age, exposure history to flu, geographic location, immune status, and other host factors. As a result, CDC collects and tests sera from vaccinated people of all ages (from infants 6 months of age to adults ≥ 65 years) and from different geographic locations, both in the United States and around the world during each flu season. The collection and use of human serology data are critical to ensure that the CVVs used in seasonal flu vaccines can provide sufficient protection against circulating flu viruses each flu season. Timing of human serology data collection CDC collects human serology data year-round to inform the recommendations for the composition of seasonal flu vaccines. For WHO vaccine recommendations, there is only a short timeframe each season after flu vaccines become available during which CDC can collect and analyze the serology data prior to the WHO VCM. The WHO VCM takes place in February for the Northern Hemisphere and in September for the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, CDC must collect and analyze human serology data twice a year in advance of these meetings to support the flu vaccine composition recommendation for the coming season. Top of PageHuman serology work to better understand the correlates of protection One goal of CDC Influenza Division’s human serology work is to increase scientific understanding of the characteristics of the immune response following vaccination that are associated with immune protection, also known as the “correlates of protection.” As a part of this work, CDC Influenza Division conducts immunogenicity studies to compare the protective benefits provided by different flu vaccine platforms. For example, studies are conducted comparing standard egg-based flu vaccines to cell-based, recombinant, adjuvanted, and high dose flu vaccines that are currently licensed to use in the United States. CDC also compares the human antibody response across different age groups and in different populations, including those with different immune status (e.g., children, elderly, health care workers, pregnant women, and people with underlining conditions). This data helps CDC determine the most effective flu vaccination strategies for specific age groups or populations. Researching the causes of flu vaccine breakthrough infections Human serology is also useful for studying flu “breakthrough infections,” which are flu infections that occur in people who have been vaccinated. CDC researchers want to better understand the immunological factors that are associated with breakthrough infections. For example, scientists have traditionally measured the amount of antibodies that a person produces following flu vaccination by a laboratory test called the hemagglutination inhibition test (HI test). The HI test is used to determine how well antibodies developed against one flu virus prevent the binding of another flu virus to red blood cells. In doing so, the test can determine how antigenically similar the two viruses are to one another. HI test is often used as a surrogate of the neutralization test. More information about the HI test and how it is used to inform vaccine composition recommendations is available at Antigenic Characterization. Certain thresholds of HI antibody titers have been shown to be associated with a reduction in the risk of flu infection (immune protection). A titer is a laboratory unit of measurement for a specific amount of antibody in a serum. HI titers are often used to evaluate how well a flu vaccine works. However, recent data show that other immunological markers (for example, antibodies to the stalk region of the flu virus’ hemagglutinin (HA) surface proteins and antibodies to the virus’ neuraminidase (NA) surface proteins) may also contribute to immune protection. To better understand the causes of flu vaccine breakthrough infections, CDC scientists analyze the sera collected from people with “breakthrough” flu infections using a variety of additional laboratory tests. In addition to microneutralization assays, which measure antibodies that can neutralize an influenza virus’ ability to cause infection, there are assays to measure antibodies that work against the flu virus’ neuraminidase (NA) surface protein; assays to measure antibodies that target the stalk region of a flu virus’ hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein; and other assays needed to identify additional immunological markers that correlate with protective immunity. Data gathered using these tests have the potential to provide critical information that will improve understanding of the underlying immunological factors contributing to vaccine breakthrough infections. This information can in turn be used to inform the most effective vaccination strategies. Learning why vaccine effectiveness varies by flu season Another area of human serology research involves understanding why flu vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and differs between flu virus types and subtypes. Many factors can impact the effectiveness of flu vaccines in the population. One factor is the similarity (or match) between the characteristics of the flu vaccine and the flu viruses that are circulating and causing illness. For example, many flu vaccines are still produced in chicken eggs, and the egg-based vaccine manufacturing production process can introduce genetic changes in vaccine viruses that allow them to grow better in chicken eggs. Such changes, however, can alter the antigenic properties of viruses, making them less similar to the flu viruses in circulation. These antigenic differences can potentially reduce the flu vaccine’s effectiveness against circulating flu viruses. In addition, complex host immunological factors also can affect the protective immunity people receive from flu vaccination. For example, “immune priming” is a concept where the benefit a person gets from vaccination (or the robustness of a person’s immune response to vaccination) may be affected by previous flu vaccinations or infections that occurred earlier in that person’s life. Top of PageDetermining population immunity against circulating human seasonal flu viruses CDC Influenza Division also conducts human serology work to measure population immunity against circulating seasonal flu viruses. This is done using seroprevalence surveys. A seroprevalence survey is an investigation that uses serology tests (also known as antibody tests) to estimate the percentage of people in a population that have antibodies against a virus of interest, such as seasonal flu viruses circulating among people. The presence of these antibodies in blood is an indicator of previous infection or vaccination. Seroprevalence surveys can tell us how many people in a specific population have existing antibodies against a particular flu virus. The percentage of people in a population who have antibodies to a particular virus is called “seroprevalence.” Alternatively, such surveys can help determine what proportion of people in the population lack antibodies to emerging flu viruses, and therefore, are susceptible to infection with these viruses. CDC collaborates with partner organizations to collect blood samples from thousands of people of all age groups. Sera are collected from people living in diverse geographic locations across the United States so that the populations sampled are representative of the U.S. population. How assessments of population immunity help with improving flu vaccines Seroprevalence surveys can help CDC determine if the population surveyed is vulnerable to emerging flu viruses. This enables flu experts to determine whether the flu vaccine should be updated to protect against these flu viruses for the upcoming flu season. Flu experts choose vaccine viruses that provide broad protection against a range of flu viruses of the same flu type, subtype, or lineage. More information is available at types of flu viruses. Top of PageUsing serology to identify past evidence of flu infection. Seroprevalence surveys are useful for identifying past mild or asymptomatic flu infections (i.e., infections without symptoms of illness) in people who are no longer shedding virus. Such infections are often missed by traditional diagnostic tests. Identifying these types of infections is especially helpful during investigations of outbreaks caused by novel viruses. In addition, by capturing both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, human serology data can help health officials better estimate the true burden of disease to implement effective vaccination strategies in the population. Determining population immunity against zoonotic flu viruses with pandemic potential Just as CDC uses seroprevalence studies to assess population immunity against seasonal flu viruses, CDC also uses the same seroprevalence surveys to assess population immunity against zoonotic (animal-origin) flu viruses with pandemic potential. For example, CDC can test the human antibodies collected by seroprevalence surveys to determine if people of a particular age or from a particular geographic area are vulnerable to infection with flu viruses that originate from animals. Examples of flu viruses that originate from animals include avian flu (bird flu) viruses or swine flu viruses (which are called “variant” flu viruses when they infect people). When a brand-new virus from animals infects people (i.e., a novel virus), the risk of the virus causing a pandemic can be high if the virus is highly transmissible (i.e., spreads easily among people) and the human population has low or no pre-existing immunity against the virus. CDC closely monitors the emergence of novel flu viruses and assesses their pandemic risk using a tool called Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT). Population immunity is a critical factor in assessing the pandemic potential of emerging novel flu viruses. Improving the assessment and selection of CVVs for use in producing pre-pandemic flu vaccines By using human serology data to determine people’s susceptibility to zoonotic flu viruses with pandemic potential, CDC can prioritize the development of pre-pandemic vaccines that protect against these viruses. For pandemic preparedness, the U.S. government has established pandemic vaccine stockpiles. As new flu viruses with pandemic potential emerge, CDC scientists evaluate whether stockpiled pre-pandemic vaccines can offer protection against them. This work helps determine whether new pre-pandemic vaccines are needed, and it informs the selection of CVVs to protect against novel flu viruses with pandemic potential.

By Kristina Herndon, RN Updated on January 26, 2022 Medically reviewed by Elizabeth Molina Ortiz, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Uses for FluMist Before Taking Dosage Side Effects Warnings & Interactions Close FluMist is a nasal spray flu vaccine that can be used as an alternative to the flu shot in some people. Studies suggest that the two options offer a similar level of protection from flu. FluMist may be a good option for adults or adolescents who are averse to injections or when there is a shortage of the traditional flu vaccine. Joe Raedle / Getty Images News / Getty Images As opposed to injectable flu vaccines, which are made with inactivated (killed) viruses, FluMist is a live attenuated vaccine made with weakened live viruses. Because of this, it must not be used by people with compromised immune systems. Uses for FluMist FluMist is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in healthy, non-pregnant people between the ages of 2 and 49. Beginning in 2024, all flu vaccines, including FluMist, contain three strains of flu virus: two influenza A viruses and one influenza B virus. Previously, vaccines included four strains, but one of those is no longer in circulation. The specific variants chosen for each annual flu vaccine are based on surveillance from over 100 national influenza centers in over 100 countries. FluMist was first approved for use in 2003. However, it was found to be less effective than flu shots in children during the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 flu seasons, leading the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to temporarily drop its recommendation for the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons. After FluMist was reformulated in 2018, the CDC added it back to the line-up of recommended vaccines for the 2018-2019 flu season and those thereafter. Latest CDC Recommendations on Flu Vaccination Before Taking FluMist is an effective vaccine choice for some, but not all. The vaccine is contraindicated for use in people who have had a prior severe allergic reaction to FluMist or any of the components of the vaccine, including egg protein. FluMist should also not be given to the following groups: Children under 2 years Adults 50 and older Children 2 to 4 years who have asthma or experienced wheezing within the past 12 months Children 2 to 17 years who are taking aspirin or any salicylate-containing medication People with weakened immune systems People without a spleen or who have a non-functioning spleen Pregnant women People with an active cerebrospinal fluid leak into the mouth, nose, or ear, or from other places in the skull People with cochlear implants People who have recently taken flu antiviral drugs may need to delay vaccination for two to five days. FluMist should be used with caution in: People with asthma over 5 years of age People with chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, kidney disease, lung disease, and diabetes People who have had Guillain-Barré syndrome within six months of a previous dose of a flu vaccine Flu Vaccine Side Effects in People With Asthma Other Flu Vaccines FluMist is the only live attenuated flu vaccine, as well as the only nasal spray flu vaccine. There are other flu vaccines delivered by injection and available under the brand names: AfluriaFluarixFluadFlublok*Flucelvax*FluLavalFluzone *Not derived from chicken eggs and considered safe for use in people with egg allergy. If FluMist is not recommended, speak to your healthcare provider about which of these is. Dosage FluMist is a fine, dry powder delivered in a syringe-like sprayer. Each sprayer contains 0.2 milliliters (mL) of the vaccine, enough for a 0.1-mL dose in each nostril. The recommended dosage varies by age and flu vaccination history, and may include one or two doses of the vaccine. Age Status Doses Schedule 2 to 8 years Not previously vaccinated 2 Separate doses by at least one month 2 to 8 years Previously vaccinated 1 n/a 9 to 49 years n/a 1 n/a How to Administer FluMist is administered by a healthcare professional. One spray is given into each nostril with a brisk compression of the suppressor. You can breathe normally during the administration and do not have to sniff. What If I Sneeze After a Dose of FluMist? Not to worry. You can sneeze (or blow your nose) after receiving a dose of FluMist. There will still be enough of the vaccine in your nostrils to trigger a protective immune defense. Side Effects Side effects are common with all drugs and vaccines, and FluMist is no exception. Most are mild and transient and will usually resolve within a day. On very rare occasions, severe side effects may occur. Common According to pre-market clinical trials, FluMist was reported to cause the following side effects in 4% or more of users: Runny noseNasal congestionHeadacheLethargyirednessDecrease appetiteMuscle achesFever (usually mild) Most side effects were low-grade and resolved on their own without treatment. Common Side Effects of Flu Vaccines Severe Younger children are at an increased risk of wheezing after receiving FluMist. Although the majority of cases in premarket studies involved children under 2 years old, the risk of wheezing remained elevated up until age 5. Some cases required hospitalization. Allergic reactions to FluMist, while possible, are extremely rare. Those who may experience a reaction (including a severe whole-body allergy known as anaphylaxis) are people with a severe egg allergy. Even so, vaccine-induced anaphylaxis is rare. In the United States, only 33 cases of anaphylaxis were reported out of over 25 million doses of childhood vaccines delivered from 2009 to 2011, according to a 2016 review of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Which Vaccines Are Safe If You're Allergic to Eggs? Warnings and Interactions FluMist is avoided in children up to the age of 17 who take aspirin. There is concern that FluMist may trigger a potentially severe condition called Reye's syndrome in children recovering from viral infections. Aspirin should be avoided for four weeks following vaccination with FluMist in anyone under the age of 18. FluMist should also not be taken with antiviral drugs used to treat flu symptoms. There are four such drugs currently approved by the FDA: Rapivab (peramivir) Relenza (zanamivir) Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) In addition to not using flu antivirals 48 hours before vaccination with FluMist, continue avoiding these drugs for two weeks after vaccination to ensure optimal effectiveness.

Recent studies have highlighted the immune-protective potential of NA against influenza and defined anti-NA antibodies as an independent correlate of protection. Even though NA head domain changes at a slightly slower pace than hemagglutinin (HA), NA is still subject to antigenic drift, and therefore an NA-based influenza vaccine antigen may have to be updated regularly and thus repeatedly administered. NA is a tetrameric type II membrane protein, which readily dissociates into dimers and monomers when expressed in a soluble form. By using a tetramerizing zipper, such as the tetrabrachion (TB) from Staphylothermus marinus, it is possible to stabilize soluble NA in its active tetrameric conformation, an imperative for the optimal induction of protective NA inhibitory antibodies. The impact of repetitive immunizations with TB-stabilized antigens on the immunogenicity of soluble TB-stabilized NA is unknown. We demonstrate that TB is immunogenic in mice. Interestingly, preexisting anti-TB antibodies enhance the anti-NA antibody response induced by immunization with TB-stabilized NA. This immune-enhancing effect was transferable by serum and operated independently of activating Fcγ receptors. We also demonstrate that priming with TB-stabilized NA antigens, enhances the NA inhibitory antibody responses against a heterosubtypic TB-stabilized NA. These findings have implications for the clinical development of oligomeric vaccine antigens that are stabilized by a heterologous oligomerizing domain.

HA binds sialic acid, the receptor, on the surface of host cells whereas the catalytic activity of NA removes the receptor. The two proteins thus have complementary activities that have evolved into a functional balance that facilitates virus entry, budding, and potentially transmission1,2,3. Importantly, recent studies have highlighted that NA inhibitory (NAI) antibodies correlate with protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza4,5,6,7,8. Nevertheless, the presence of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibodies in circulation remains the primary correlate of protection9 and currently licensed influenza vaccines aim primarily to induce seroprotective HAI titers. Unlike a natural infection, split inactivated influenza vaccines poorly induce NA-reactive antibodies10,11. In general, antigenic drift in NA of human influenza A viruses is considered to proceed at a slower pace compared to HA12. However, besides antigenic drift in NA as determined by the presence of NAI antibodies, drift may also result from non-NAI antibodies that recognize the lateral side of NA which can protect through Fcγ receptor-mediated mechanisms13. To improve the generally poor anti-NA response induced by current influenza vaccines, it has been suggested that supplementation of inactivated influenza vaccines with stabilized NA could potentially further improve protection14,15.The production of stable, tetrameric NA is a critical requisite for its use as an immunogen that can induce NAI antibodies. Enzymatic activity of NA has been frequently assumed as an indication for its correct folding and oligomeric assembly. Influenza NA activity is only observed when the protein is assembled into a homo-tetramer16,17. It remains unclear why influenza NA is only active as a tetramer given that each protomer contains an active site. Possibly, contacts between NA protomers in the tetrameric assembly critically contribute to the stabilization of the catalytic site, as has been suggested by molecular dynamic simulations18. The tetrameric configuration of NA is promoted by the transmembrane domain19. Hence the production of stable, soluble tetrameric NA presents a challenge. This challenge has been addressed by fusing the NA head domain to a heterologous tetramerizing zipper such as the human vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) domain, a tetramerizing domain derived from the yeast general control transcription factor GCN4, or at tetramerizing domain derived from tetrabrachion (TB)20,21,22. TB is a tetramerizing domain derived from the surface layer protein of the thermophile Staphylothermus marinus and forms a highly stable, right-handed parallel coiled-coil, which provides higher stability than VASP or GCN4 domains when fused to soluble NA22,23,24. We previously reported that the TB domain can be used to generate soluble tetrameric NA that is enzymatically active and can induce protective NAI responses25. Furthermore, crystal structure analysis showed that the fusion of TB to an N9 NA head domain faithfully mimics the structure of the corresponding native NA head domain26.Although TB-stabilized NA, among other zippers, is being explored as an NAI antibody-inducing vaccine antigen, the immunogenicity of the TB and its impact on antigen immunogenicity upon repeated immunizations have not been evaluated. Evaluating the immunogenicity of TB is important since seasonal influenza vaccines are administered repeatedly during life. Here, we used TB fused to the domain III of human serum albumin (tetHSA) to induce preexisting anti-TB immune responses in mice. TB-primed mice were subsequently immunized with TB-NA antigen fusions derived from N1 or N2 NA. Data indicated that TB-specific serum IgG antibodies were readily induced by these fusion proteins. Interestingly, the presence of anti-TB IgG favored the NAI response elicited by subsequent immunization with TB-NA antigen. We also found that the enhanced NAI responses could be transferred by anti-TB IgG-containing immune serum yet was independent of activating Fcγ receptors.ResultsTetrabrachion is immunogenicWe generated three types of recombinant proteins to assess the potential immunogenicity of the non-NA components of the fusion proteins (Fig. 1a). First, we constructed recombinant TB-stabilized tetrameric N1 and N2 NA that was expressed in and purified from transiently transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. These NA constructs comprised the full-length (50 amino acid residues) coiled-coil domain of TB genetically fused to the head domain of NA derived from H1N1pdm A/Belgium/145-MA/2009 (Bel09) or H3N2 A/Texas/50/2012 (Tx12). In addition, the TB-NA expression constructs carried a CD5 signal sequence and an N-terminal His-tag that was used for purification of the soluble tetrameric NA constructs. Secondly, domain III of human serum albumin protein fused to TB (tetHSA) was designed and produced. Finally, an irrelevant His-tagged protein (irrHT; a single domain antibody directed against Junin virus) was used as a control to evaluate the potential immunogenicity of the His-tag (Fig. 1a). The enzymatic activity of the resulting tetNABel09 and tetNATx12 proteins was confirmed using fluorogenic 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) as a substrate, indicating that the proteins were correctly folded (Fig. 1b).Fig. 1: Tetrabrachion is immunogenic.a Schematic representation of the recombinant proteins that were used as immunogens. TB fusion proteins were constructed with the CD5 secretion signal, and the mature proteins contained a His-tag (HT), followed by a thrombin cleavage site (tCS), the TB coiled-coil domain (tet) followed by the head domain of Bel/09 NA (tetNABel09), the head domain of Tx12 (tetNATx12), or human serum albumin domain III (tetHSA). The irrelevant His-tagged (irrHT) protein is a single domain antibody (VHH) directed against Junin virus. b Specific activity of tetNA fusion proteins as determined in a MUNANA assay. c Mouse immunization scheme. Groups of 20 BALB/c mice received three immunizations at intervals of 2 weeks with either PBS, tetHSA, or irrHT (D0, D14, and D28). Six weeks after the first immunization groups of five mice were immunized with PBS, irrHT, tetNABel09, or tetNATx12, and this immunization was repeated 2 weeks later. Blood was collected 2 weeks after the prime, and prior to each subsequent immunization. d–f Serology. ELISA was performed using tetHSA captured in nickel-coated plates with sera isolated after the first, second, and third (d), the fourth (e), and fifth (f) immunization. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by Sidak’s multicomparison test, red horizontal bars represent means (*p < 0.05 and ****p < 0.0001). The dotted line in panels d–f represents the limit of detection, corresponding to the initial serum dilution used in the assay.Full size imageWe hypothesized that the TB domain would be immunogenic and, since seasonal influenza vaccines are administered repeatedly throughout life, preexisting immune responses against TB might affect the immunogenicity of a subsequently administered TB-stabilized NA. To evaluate this, BALB/c mice were first immunized three times with tetHSA, irrHT, or PBS. Two weeks after the third immunization, the mice received two additional immunizations with tetNABel09, tetNATx12, irrHT, or PBS as outlined in Fig. 1c. All immunizations were performed by intramuscular injection using AF03 as an adjuvant.Two weeks after the first tetHSA immunization, the majority of the mice had undetectable anti-tetHSA IgGs. However, after a second dose, all the tetHSA immunized mice had seroconverted and anti-tetHSA titers were boosted further after the third dose of this immunogen. As expected, anti-tetHSA serum IgG responses were undetectable in animals that received PBS (Fig. 1d). Serum from mice that had been immunized three times with irrHT did not show detectable antibodies against tetHSA, suggesting the absence of anti-His-tag antibodies (Fig. 1d). After the first immunization with tetNABel09 or tetNATx12, anti-tetHSA serum IgG titers increased further in mice that had been previously immunized with tetHSA but not anymore after the second immunization with TB-NA (fifth immunization in total) in those mice. Interestingly, anti-tetHSA IgG titers were also induced by immunization of PBS- or IrrHT-primed mice with tetNABel09 and tetNATx12 (Fig. 1e, f). These results suggest that the TB domain and/or the His-tag in TB-NA is immunogenic. However, immunization with tetNAs did not induce detectable IgG titers against the irrelevant His-tagged protein indicating that the His-tag in tetNA is poorly immunogenic in mice (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b).Preexisting anti-TB immune responses increase NAI responses induced by tetNA immunizationWe assessed the possible impact of preexisting anti-TB responses on subsequent immunization with TB-stabilized soluble N1 or N2 NA. Quantification of serum anti-tetNA IgGs by capture ELISA showed that mice that had been primed by immunization with tetHSA had higher anti-tetNA titers after the first immunization with tetNABel09 or tetNATx12 compared to the mice that had been primed with PBS or the irrelevant His-tagged protein (Fig. 2a, c). This difference was less apparent after the second dose of tetNA (Fig. 2b, d).Fig. 2: TetHSA priming is associated with an increased anti-NA response.TetNA-specific serum IgG titers were determined by ELISA with tetNATx12 (a, b) or tetNABel09 (c, d) captured in wells of Ni NTA coated plates. a Anti-tetNATx12 titers after the fourth and b fifth immunization.

The dotted line represents the limit of detection, corresponding to the initial serum dilution used in the assay.Full size imageTo assess whether the increased anti-TB-NA IgG titer that was observed in tetHSA-primed mice that had been boosted with TB-NA was not merely due to increased anti-TB responses, NAI titers in the different sera were determined. NAI assays were performed with sera collected after the fourth and fifth immunization using H6N1 and H6N2 reassortant viruses that carried homologous NA as targets in an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). After the first immunization with tetNA, the calculated NAI IC50 values for H6Nbel09 and H6Ntx12 were significantly higher in mice that had been pre-immunized with tetHSA compared to mice that had been primed with PBS or the irrelevant His-tagged protein (Fig. 3a, c). The increased serum NAI in tetHSA-primed mice was still observed after a second immunization with tetNABel01 but not with tetNATx12 (Fig. 3d, b, respectively). Interestingly, priming of mice with tetNABel09 (2x) followed by two booster immunizations with tetNATx12 or vice versa, also resulted in a significantly higher NAI titer compared to PBS-primed mice (Supplementary Fig. 2). These data suggest that preexisting antibodies directed against TB contribute to an increased immune response induced by a subsequent immunization with soluble tetNA.Fig. 3: Neuraminidase inhibition titers are increased in tetHSA-primed mice.NAI was determined in sera collected after the fourth (a, c) and fifth immunization (b, d). The reassortant viruses H6Ntx12 (a, b) and H6Nbel09 (c, d) were used as a source of NA in the ELLA. Data shows the IC50 values as determined by nonlinear regression analysis and plotted as the values of 1:x dilution resulting in 50% NA inhibition. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Sidak’s comparison test, bars represent means (*p = 0.03, ****p < 0.0001). The dotted line represents the limit of detection, corresponding to the initial serum dilution used in the assay.Full size imageThe immune-enhancing effect induced by tetHSA is transferable by serumTo test to which extent the increased immunogenicity of tetNABel09 in tetHSA-primed mice is dependent on the humoral response, serum obtained from tetHSA- or control-immunized mice was transferred to naïve animals one day prior to immunization with tetNABel09. This procedure was repeated two weeks later to recapitulate the active tetNA prime-boost immunization regimen described above (Fig. 4a). IgG1 was the predominant tetHSA-reactive IgG subclass in the transferred sera, followed by IgG2a and IgG3 whereas a low titer of IgM and no IgG2b was detectable (Supplementary Fig. 3). Mice that were pretreated with 10 or 100 µl of tetHSA serum given intraperitoneally responded with a significantly higher NAI IC50 titer after the first tetNA immunization when compared to mice that had received naive serum (Fig. 4b). A similar trend was observed following the second serum treatment followed by immunization, although a statistically significant difference was not obtained (Fig. 4c).Fig. 4: Passive transfer of tetHSA immune serum enhances NAI antibodies.a Immunization scheme. BALB/c mice received 100 or 10 µl of anti-tetHSA or naïve serum intraperitoneally on days 0 and 13 and were immunized the following day with tetNABel09 (+) or PBS control (−). Blood was sampled on days 13 and 28. b, c NAI against H6Nbel09 determined in sera collected 2 weeks after the first (b) and second immunization (c).

Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by Sidak’s comparison test, bars represents means (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001). The dotted line in panels b–g represents the limit of detection, corresponding to the initial serum dilution used in the assay.Full size imageThe tetHSA serum transfer followed by the first immunization with tetNABel09 induced higher, although not statistically significantly different, IgG titers against immobilized tetNABel09, compared to the response in control serum recipients (Fig. 4d). On day 28, 2 weeks after the second immunization with tetNABel09, the anti-tetNABel09 serum IgG titers were comparable in all four groups of mice (Fig. 4e). Anti-tetHSA titers were higher in the mice that received 100 µl of tetHSA serum 2 weeks after the first immunization with tetNABel09 (Fig. 4f). However, after the second tetNABel09 immunization the anti-tetHSA IgG titers were significantly lower in mice that had received anti-tetHSA serum prior to tetNABel09 immunization when compared to mice that had received sera from naïve mice (Fig. 4g). These data indicate that serum with anti-TB antibodies can promote NAI responses induced by tetNA whereas such antibodies, at the same time, are associated with a reduced anti-TB antibody response induced by a TB-carrying antigen.Increased tetNA immunogenicity by preexisting anti-TB antibodies does not rely on activating Fcγ receptorsAntibodies can form immune complexes that promote adaptive immune responses against the complexed antigen by the interaction of the Fc domain of these antibodies with activating Fcγ receptors such as Fcγ RI27. To evaluate the possible role of activating Fcγ receptors in the enhanced NAI response in the presence of preexisting anti-TB antibodies, Fcer1g−/− and wild-type (wt) BALB/c mice were immunized three times with tetHSA, followed by two immunizations with tetNABel09. In mice, Fcer1g, codes for the common γ-chain of the activating Fcγ receptors I, III, and IV28. There was no difference in the anti-tetHSA serum IgG response between wild-type and Fcer1g−/− mice (Fig. 5a). As before, tetHSA-primed wild-type mice displayed significantly higher serum NAI levels after the first immunization with tetNABel09 compared to the PBS-primed mice (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, this difference in NAI levels between PBS- and tetHSA-primed animals was even more pronounced in the Fcer1g−/− mice (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, this difference still reached statistical significance after a boost immunization with tetNABel09 of Fcer1g−/− mice and wt mice (Fig. 5c). We conclude that activating FcγR signaling in mice is not required for the immune-stimulating effect of preexisting anti-tetHSA immune responses against subsequent immunization with tetNA with a shared TB-based tetramerizing domain.Fig. 5: NAI responses are increased in TB-primed wild-type and Fcerg1−/− mice.a ELISA titers against tetHSA in sera isolated after three immunizations with PBS or tetHSA in wt and Fcer1g−/− mice. b, c NAI determined against H6Nbel09 in sera collected after the fourth (b) and fifth immunization (c).

Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Sidak’s comparison test, bars represent means (*p = 0.02, **p < 0.01, ***p = 0.0002, ****p < 0.0001). The data points are compiled from two independently performed experiments. The dotted line represents the limit of detection, corresponding to the initial serum dilution used in the assay.Full size imageDiscussionThe fusion of NA to the coiled-coil domain of TB was shown to stabilize the tetrameric head domain of NA, while allowing correct folding, and enabled the large-scale production and purification of homogenous, batch-to-batch consistent NA antigen. Here we showed that TB fused to the control protein HSA, NA from group 1 (tetNABel09) or group 2 (tetNATx12), is immunogenic in mice. Interestingly, preexisting anti-TB antibodies were associated with the induction of increased IgG and NAI titers after a subsequent immunization with tetNA. Such effect was observed when mice were primed with control tetHSA protein and also in a heterologous tetN1/N2 prime-boost regimen. Similar to the active immunization, the transfer of serum from mice immunized with tetHSA also resulted in increased IgG and NAI titers after subsequent tetNA immunization. This observation indicates that the enhanced immune response is mediated by anti-tetHSA antibodies but does not exclude a possible contribution of a helper T cell response directed against one or more T helper epitopes in the tetramerizing domain of tetrabrachion in the active immunization setting. Further, passive transfer of serum with anti-tetHSA IgG was associated with reduced anti-TB IgG induction after immunization with tetNABel09.The modulation of the humoral response by antibodies relies on different mechanisms that can either lead to suppression or enhancement of this response29. For example, a reduction of antibody induction has been previously described in the context of the anti-HA response, which was attributed to antigenic masking by the preexisting anti-HA antibodies30,31,32. Here, the small size of the TB domain (6 kDa) relative to NA (44 kDa) may facilitate antigenic masking by antibodies and the consequent suppression of the anti-TB response, which we observed in the passive transfer experiment (Fig. 4g)33. The reduced response was TB-specific, suggesting that anti-TB antibodies do not sterically interfere with the recognition of epitopes on the NA head domain. A reduced anti-TB response was not observed in the active immunization setting upon subsequent immunization with tetNA, suggesting that antigenic masking is not sufficient to modulate anti-TB IgGs. We speculate that this may be due to our experimental design that made use of three immunizations to saturate the humoral anti-TB response. Alternatively, T helper cells directed against the TB domain induced by active immunization may have contributed to antigen presentation in trans.In addition to the suppression of the anti-TB response in the serum transfer experiment, another important observation in our study is the enhancement of antibody responses against the TB-fused NA, which was observed after either active or passive immunization. Different Ab subclasses have been described as being able to mediate enhanced immune responses. The mechanism of enhancement may involve the recognition of antibody-antigen immune complexes by Fcγ receptors, complement receptors, or FcRn27,33,34. Previous studies using monoclonal antibodies complexed with antigens and knock-out mice have shown that Fcγ receptors are required for IgG1 and IgG2a-mediated enhancement of the immune response against the hapten trinitrophenyl27. IgG3 and IgGM have been described to promote the antibody response through a complement-dependent mechanism35. Here we show that the level of enhancement achieved after active tetHSA immunization in Fcer1g−/− mice, which lack functional FcγRI, FcγRIII, FcγRIV, and FcεRI, is even slightly higher than the immune-stimulating effect observed in the wild-type mice. This result indicates that FcγRI, FcγRIII, FcγRIV, and FcεRI, have no significant role or their contribution can be compensated by other mechanisms (e.g., complement- or FcRn-dependent). The complexity of polyclonal sera imposes limitations in the dissection of these mechanisms in our model. We hypothesize that preexisting anti-TB IgG3 can form immune complexes that favor the transport and availability of antigen in the lymphoid organs through follicular dendritic cells36. Such IgG3-mediated immune complexes could be formed with complement, and it has been reported that lack of C1q or C3 impairs the ability of IgG3 to enhance antibody responses in mice37.In summary, our results indicate no deleterious, but rather an immune-enhancing effect of repeated TB immunization for the generation of immune responses against TB-stabilized NA. Whether such an enhancing effect of repeat immunization of TB-stabilized tetrameric NA would also be apparent in a clinical setting remains to be determined.MethodsDesign and production of recombinant proteinsThe coding information for TB-NA and TB-HSA fusion proteins was cloned under the transcriptional control of the CMV promoter in the pCDNA3.4 plasmid with a CD5 secretion signal, an amino-terminal His-tag, and the thrombin cleavage signal followed by tetrabrachion-NA or tetrabrachion-HSA domain III. TB-NA and TB-HSA were expressed in a mammalian cell culture system as previously described with modifications38.The irrelevant His-tagged protein used is a single domain antibody directed against the Junín virus, which was produced in P. pastoris as described previously39. Briefly, 48 h after methanol induction, cells were pelleted and the growth medium was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (80% saturation). The insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000×g and the pellet was solubilized in 10 ml of HisTrap binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.4) before purification on a 1 ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare).Recombinant NA activity measurementThe enzymatic activity of tetNABel09 and tetNATx12 was determined with the fluorogenic small substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) as follows. Ten microliters of 1 mM of 4-MUNANA (Sigma cat # M8639) in 200 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 2 mM CaCl2 and 1% butanol was incubated with 40 µl of PBS solution containing 30, 15, 7.5, or 3.75 ng of tetNA. Conversion to 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) was monitored every 2 min for 1 h using BMG Fluostar OPTIMA reader (excitation at 365 nm and emission determined at 450 nm). A standard curve with 800 to 25 pmoles/well of 4-methylumbelliferyl (Sigma cat # M1508) was used to extrapolate the molar conversion of MUNANA per microgram of purified recombinant tetNABel09 and tetNATx12.Mouse immunization experimentsAll animal experiments were conducted according to the Belgian legislation (Belgian Law 14/08/1986 and Belgium Royal Decree 06/04/2010) and European legislation on protection of animals used for scientific purposes (EU directives 2010/63/EU and 86/609/EEC). Experimental protocols were all approved by the Ethics Committee of the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB), Ghent University, Faculty of Science (permit numbers EC016-059 and EC2019-035). Female BALB/c mice, aged 6–7 weeks, were purchased from Charles River (France) and Fcer1g−/− mice on the BALB/c background were from Taconic Biosciences. The animals were housed in a specified pathogen-free animal house with food and water ad libitum. Animals were immunized intramuscularly in the right quadriceps. Immunization was performed with 50 µl containing 1 µg of recombinant protein (tetHSA, tetNABel09, tetNATx12, or irrHT). All immunizations were adjuvanted with a 1:1 volume of AF03 (25 μl of antigen in PBS + 25 μl of AF03 per dose)40. In serum transfer experiments animals received 100 or 10 µl of PBS- or tetHSA immune serum, pooled from individual mice that had been immunized three times with tetHSA or PBS in the presence of AF03 adjuvant. Serum (100 or 10 µl adjusted with 90 µl PBS to 100 µl total volume) was injected intraperitoneally 1 day prior to tetNA immunization.Two weeks after each immunization, 75–150 µl of blood was collected by puncturing the lateral tail vein with a 23 G needle. The obtained blood samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to allow clotting, which was followed by centrifugation at 10,500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (the serum) was recovered and submitted to a second centrifugation at 10,500×g for 5 min. Cleared sera were stored at −20 °C before use in serological assays. Before terminal retro-orbital bleeding, animals were first humanely sacrificed with an anesthetic overdose of Nembutal (6 mg per mouse).ELISAAnti-tetNA and anti-tetHSA IgG levels in mouse sera were determined by capture ELISA using tetNABel09, tetNATx12 or tetHSA in PierceTM nickel-coated plates (cat. # 15442). To determine anti-irrHT serum IgG titers, irrHT was directly coated on MaxisorpTM plates (Thermofisher cat. # 44-2404-21). Recombinant proteins were diluted in DPBS (Life technologies cat. # 14040-182) (tetNA and irrHT was diluted to 0.5 µg/ml and tetHSA to 0.29 µg/ml). Then, 50 µl of the coating antigen solutions was added to each well and the plate was subsequently incubated at room temperature for 1 h on a shaking platform. The wells of the plates were then washed three times with PBS-T (Sigma cat. # P3563-10PAK) and blocked for 1 h with 1% BSA in DPBS. After blocking, the wells of the plates were washed once with PBS-T and incubated with a threefold serial dilution, starting at a 1/100 dilution, of serum in DPBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% tween20 for 2 h at room temperature on a shaking platform. The wells of the plates were then washed five times with PBS-T and incubated with a 1:4000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG-HRP, (GE healthcare cat. # NA931-1ml), anti-mouse IgG3-HRP (SouthernBiotech cat. # 1100-08), anti-mouse IgG2a-HRP (SouthernBiotech cat. #1080-05), anti-mouse IgG2b-HRP (SouthernBiotech cat. # 1090-05), anti-mouse IgG1-HRP (SouthernBiotech cat.#1070-01), or 1:5000 dilution of anti-mouse IgM-HRP (Bio-RAD STAR86), in PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween20. The 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidineTMB substrate (TMB) (BD cat. # 555214) was added after three washes with PBS-T and the reaction was stopped after 5 min by addition of 50 µl of 1 M H2SO4. The optical density (OD) in each well was determined at 450 nm and, as a reference, 655 nm using an iMark™ Microplate Absorbance Reader (Bio-rad). The end point titer was determined for each serum sample by scoring the dilution that resulted in an OD that was equal to or higher than two times the background OD obtained from the pre-immune control sera dilution series.Enzyme-linked lectin assay to determine neuraminidase inhibition titersFetuin (Sigma cat. # F3385) was diluted into coating buffer (KPL cat. # 50-84-01) to a concentration of 25 µg/ml and 50 µl was added to the wells of Nunc MaxiSorp™ plates (Thermofisher cat. # 44-2404-21), which were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The coated plates were then washed three times with PBS-T (Sigma cat. # P3563-10PAK) and incubated overnight with 60 μl of a 1/327 dilution of H6N1A/Belgium/145/2009 or 1/220 dilution of H6N2A/Texas/50/2012 and 60 µl of 2-fold serial dilution of serum, starting at a 1/20 dilution, in sample buffer (1X MES VWR cat. # AAJ61979-AP: 20 mM CaCl2, 1% BSA, 0.5% Tween20). These dilutions of the H6Nx viruses correspond to the 70% maximum activity of NA from the respective viruses as determined in the ELLA assay. Fetuin-coated plates were then washed three times with PBS-T and incubated for 1 h with a solution of PNA-HRP (cat. # L6135-1MG, Sigma) at 5 μg/ml in conjugate diluent (MES pH 6.5, 20 mM CaCl2, 1% BSA). The plates were washed three times with PBS-T, TMB substrate was added and then the plates were incubated for 5 min before the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 µl of 1 M H2SO4. The optical density was measured at 450 nm and as a reference 655 nm in an iMark™ Microplate Absorbance Reader (Bio-rad). Half maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC50) values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism software).Statistical analysisResults are presented as individual data points with the mean indicated. Quantitative variables were tested using one-way ANOVA and where significant differences were found, post hoc analysis using the Sidak test was performed. GraphPad Prism version 8.3.0 was used for analysis and statistical significance was considered when p < 0.05.Reporting SummaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

working together to better understand and treat the syndrome January 26, 2022 • By Sabrina Richards / Fred Hutch News Service Researchers around the world are working to get to the bottom of long COVID-19, in which symptoms like brain fog and fatigue linger long past a patient's acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Investigators at Fred Hutch and UW work together to tackle the challenges of the syndrome in an evolving pandemic. Stock photo courtesy of Getty Images Robin Macnofskyâs first symptoms, in April 2020, were so mild she didnât take a test for COVID-19, preferring to save it for someone who really needed it. A few weeks later her chest tightened and her temperature spiked. These ebbed, but an even stronger wave hit: a high fever and exhaustion that left her bedbound in a days-long âzombie sleep.â Macnofsky tested positive for COVID-19 (likely from remaining viral genetic material). Her symptoms endured. Previously a champion multi-tasker who could split her concentration in four directions, the then-59-year-old could no longer follow the plot of a TV episode or walk her dog. Her temperature waxed and waned. A realization dawned: The end was nowhere in sight, and no one could tell her why. Scientists studying the unfamiliar and unfurling COVID-19 pandemic also began to realize that for Macnofsky and many other COVID-19 patients, a long hospital stay or a short, mild illness were not the only outcomes. For some people, mild symptoms, quickly resolved, were just the beginning. Researchers worldwide, including many at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington, are working to understand long COVID-19, the long-lasting effects of COVID-19 infection that can affect adults, teens and children. Hutch and UW investigators are building on deep expertise in immunology and infectious diseases like HIV to figure out what causes long COVID-19, who is at risk, and how to treat it. To do so, theyâre tackling challenges that range from basic questions about how best to measure symptoms to uncovering the complex immunological interplay that may drive symptoms. âSomething is differentâ In March 2020, Julie Czartoski, a nurse practitioner working with Fred Hutch virology expert and Joel D. Meyers Endowed Chair holder Dr. Julie McElrath, helped McElrath quickly put together a study, the Seattle COVID Cohort Study, to look at COVID-19 in first responders and those infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. They wanted to know who was getting it, and how badly. Soon they opened the study to others in the community. Luckily, few participants who contracted the coronavirus had symptoms that warranted hospitalization. Most had relatively mild infections that cleared up quickly. But that wasnât the end. For many, symptoms persisted, even worsened. Participants reported lingering fevers, new joint pain, exhaustion and brain fog, among a grab bag of other symptoms. When an unexpected number of young, healthy firefighters reported atrial fibrillation â a rapid, abnormal heart rhythm â Czartoski knew something was up. âItâs not unheard of in young adults, but to have so many was weird,â she said. âI remember texting Julie McElrath and saying, âSomething is different, because these people are still sick.ââ Because of their fast action and prompt study enrollment, Czartoski and McElrath were early to recognize a truth that would eventually become clear to other scientists: COVID-19 can cast a long shadow. More research and resourcesÂ UW Medicine offers a Post-COVID-19 Rehabilitation and Recovery Clinic for people suffering from lingering symptoms. The NIH RECOVER Initiative is a nationwide study aimed at understanding and addressing long COVID-19. The Hutch's COVID-19 Clinical Research Center recently initiated the Seattle-area arm of a drug aimed at long COVID fatigue. Many of the people in McElrathâs study who reported lasting problems had experienced mild, almost cold-like infections with SARS-CoV-2. Very few had been hospitalized. It takes time to know for sure that a patient is suffering from long COVID-19. A week or two is not long enough to be sure their symptoms wonât clear up soon. Eventually, McElrath and her team found that about 30% of the coronavirus-positive participants in their study had lasting symptoms, or new symptoms attributed to COVID-19, that extended at least 60 days past their initial infection, Czartoski said. Long COVID-19 dogs some patients, like Macnofsky, much longer, and their symptoms can be severe. After two different week-long hospital stays, in which she underwent terrifying procedures to remove nearly a liter of fluid pressing on her heart and then her lungs, Macnofsky took a leave of absence from her career as a community organizer. By early 2022, she still rations her energy and has yet to regain her prior multi-tasking abilities. Time defines the syndrome and time challenges those suffering from it and the scientists working to untangle it. Also known as PASC, for post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, long COVID-19 refers to symptoms that endure long after someone has recovered from their initial coronavirus infection. (The term âsequelaeâ refers to a diseaseâs aftereffects.) Symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, fever, anxiety and depression. COVID-19 patients who were sick enough to need ICU care may also be dealing with post-ICU syndrome, and it's not yet clear how their experience will unfold differently from patients who were treated in the ICU for other causes. For a health problem as mysterious and as complex as long COVID-19, progress requires scientific teamwork. Thatâs why, in summer 2021, Dr. Rachel Bender Ignacio reached out to investigators across Fred Hutch and the University of Washington, inviting them to join a long COVID-19 working group to share challenges and solutions, and find collaborators to help investigate specific questions. As medical director of the Hutchâs COVID-19 Clinical Research Center, or CCRC, Bender Ignacio had a good sense of who at both institutions were treating or studying the syndrome. She was also hearing from CCRC trial participants who had transitioned from acute to long COVID-19 and wanted to know how scientists were addressing it. âI have my ear to the ground,â she said. Bender Ignacio felt that progress required stronger connections between clinicians and laboratory and translational scientists. Physicians needed a better understanding of the biological mechanisms driving long COVID-19 before they could move proposed treatments into clinical trials, and basic scientists could reveal those mechanisms but needed tissue samples and clinical insights from the people providing patient care. âBringing everyone together was the least I could do,â Bender Ignacio said. The working group she put together is an example of international and multidisciplinary efforts to tackle the challenges that vex investigators studying long COVID-19, including how to best classify and diagnose the syndrome, whatâs causing it, and how to treat it. The recently launched National Institutes of Health RECOVER initiative, aimed at understanding PASC, is giving the investigators in the field hope that standards may be forthcoming, said Dr. Eric Chow, a working group member and UW infectious diseases fellow who studies the damage that respiratory viruses can do outside the lungs. The researchers who joined Bender Ignacioâs collective span disciplines and body systems, including the brain, heart and lungs. They include researchers and clinicians at UW and Harborview Medical Center, which opened one of the nationâs earliest clinics devoted to helping long COVID-19 patients. The working group members bring expertise in long-term complications from viral infections like HIV and influenza, and know how viruses or the immune reaction to them can damage the body. SARS-CoV-2 may be wreaking the most havoc right now, but itâs not the only virus that can upend sufferersâ lives: Many, including Bender Ignacio, have spent their careers studying the long-term effects of HIV. Now the team is bringing their wide-ranging expertise to bear on the many questions of long-haul COVID-19, hoping to surmount its challenges and help patients. Learning on the fly Studying a little-understood problem in a rapidly shifting pandemic is incredibly challenging. At the beginning, scientists had no knowledge base to inform their data collection or study design. Every week or month brought new information that forced them to reassess the data they had already collected â and adjust their data-collection methods to incorporate new understanding. âItâs like building a boat while youâre sailing it,â said working group and CCRC member Dr. James Andrews, a University of Washington rheumatologist who studies how sepsis, particularly severe cases requiring hospitalization, can lead to long-term disability. The first challenge was realizing that a problem existed. Many of the long-haulers Czartoski interviewed for the Seattle COVID Cohort Study struggled to find help and even recognition of their symptoms, she said. âIn the beginning, a big part of my job was just listening,â Czartoski recalled. Study participants wept as they described to her their crushing fatigue and debilitating symptoms, and the struggle to get health care providers to understand that their vague-seeming complaints posed a real problem. Macnofsky, too, found it difficult to get help for her constant fever, headaches, fatigue and brain fog. In the beginning, no one knew what information would be important to understand why these patients were suffering and how to help. A snapshot of data âis one piece of the whole puzzle,â said Hutch statistician Dr. Zoe Moodie, who helps design and analyze HIV vaccine trials and develops statistical methods to analyze immunological data. âGenerally, the more pieces the better, and as time goes go on we learn which are the important pieces.â Czartoski tackled the problem by collecting everything she could: âSometimes [a symptom] didnât seem important, then a week later Iâd have five people reporting it.â And sometimes the information that most impacts a patientâs life can seem negligible when committed to paper, she said. One personâs loss of smell or taste may seem like small potatoes compared to othersâ chronic exhaustion and continual fevers. But such seemingly small symptoms can make life and some careers difficult: Firefighters smell phantom burning and parents who can no longer smell a dirty diaper. Once-favorite food now repells. âAnd [those symptoms] are really tough on quality of life,â Czartoski noted. Depression can set in, straining a personâs long-term relationships, affecting quality of life and for some, the ability to hold down a job. Initially, she had a limited systematized questionnaire, and took notes longhand while patients noted every symptom they could think of â whether they knew it related to their COVID-19 or not. As time passed, Czartoski and her colleagues were able to spot common symptoms that they added to an ever-expanding checklist. (Then, they had to get the checklist built into the study records system.) The working group members brainstorm statistical and analytical strategies that could help, and which take into account the fact that not everyoneâs data has been collected in the same way at the same time points during the course of their disease. Even now, their efforts to untangle long COVID-19 are hampered by what they didnât know six, 12, 18 months ago, Czartoski said. âResearchers will ask about blood drawn a year and a half ago: Were they taking Tylenol?â she said. âIt could change the immune response, but I donât know!â Fred Hutch HIV researchers Dr. Julie McElrath (left) and Dr. Rachel Bender Ignacio (right) are parlaying their expertise in viral infections and clinical trials to help patients suffering from long COVID-19.

Photos by Robert Hood / Hutch News Service Finding the right box Another major challenge that long COVID-19 researchers face is classification. Many studies are producing data on the syndrome, but if symptoms arenât collected and classified similarly, trying to compare different studies will be like comparing apples and oranges. Decisions about how to classify symptoms also affect how patients are grouped together and how the data is analyzed. One big concern: Should patients be grouped by symptom, or should symptoms be grouped by the organs they affect? Itâs a bit of a chicken-and-egg issue, but it gets into the problem of whatâs behind long COVID-19 to begin with, said Chow, who began treating Macnofsky after her hospital stay. (The two teamed up to tell Macnofskyâs story in a dual first-person essay published in the scientific journal Open Forum Infectious Diseases.) âFor example, what about fatigue? Do you group everyone with fatigue together? But what if one personâs fatigue is caused by damage to the nervous system, anotherâs by damage to their heart, and someone elseâs by lung damage,â said Chow, who at the start of the pandemic was part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team that went to New York state to confirmÂ COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Even in cases where itâs clear the immune system is at fault, fatigue may not have a single cause. Energy-sucking immune activation could explain one personâs fatigue, but post-infection autoimmunity, in which their own tissues are under attack, could be the reason behind anotherâs, Andrews said. Trying to find the biological similarities in data taken from these patients would be like trying to compare pages of text written in different languages: more likely to result in gibberish than to identify a helpful pattern. And sometimes, symptoms may not even be the result of a personâs coronavirus infection. Part of the problem is the often-vague, widely varying collection of symptoms, many of which long COVID-19 shares with other chronic health problems, such as autoimmune diseases or chronic fatigue syndrome. Autoimmune diseases often strike in young adulthood. For some people, SARS-CoV-2 infection and an autoimmune diagnosis are just two pieces of unrelated bad luck. âIn a longitudinal cohort like this, nothing is ever completely clean,â Czartoski said. Working group members share questions and strategies. Should they classify symptoms by severity score, or follow the CDCâs recommendations to classify symptoms by outcome measures in different areas? Members often draw on their or other membersâ expertise in different disciplines, such as adapting questionnaires used by neurologists to assess cognitive difficulties. Czartoski recommended a severity scale long used by HIV researchers to assess how symptoms impact patientsâ daily living. The team also grapples with the challenges of classifying symptoms that may seem focused on a specific organ system, but are actually emblematic of a body-wide problem. Researchers noted that some simplification needs to occur to make it possible to analyze the reams of data that can be collected. But sometimes itâs unclear whatâs causing someoneâs symptom â so researchers canât classify symptoms by underlying cause. What then? Members also keep an eye on trends in the wider scientific community to see if they can align with areas of growing consensus, the better to compare their results with other studies. Whoâs at risk for symptoms, and how long will they last? But sorting out the logistical challenges of classification is just the first step. Long COVID-19 researchers want to understand why symptoms develop and whoâs at risk. Why do some symptoms affect some patients but not others? Who will have a mild course, and who will suffer greatly? A deeper understanding, they hope, will shed light on why symptoms linger so long for some people, and how to predict how a patientâs experience will unfold. UW neurologist Dr. Payal Patel is focusing on the cognitive symptoms of PASC. âI want to know, what is the cause of the symptoms we see in PASC,â said Patel, who studies the continuing effects of infections of the central nervous system, including HIV. âWe know PASC affects different organ systems. Iâm trying to get a better clinical understanding of how it affects the brain.â Without this, itâs difficult to give worried patients a clear picture of what they can expect from long COVID. Patel wants to better understand how long such symptoms last, whoâs most at risk, and whatâs causing them. Is brain fog caused primarily by immune dysfunction? Or could the clotting problems associated with COVID-19 have damaged the cells lining blood vessels in the brain? Patel and a team of scientists have studies underway to answer these questions. This type of location-specific question can be very difficult to address, Chow noted. Itâs relatively easy to take blood samples and look at general patterns of immune cells or antibodies floating through the blood. But what about problems that are occurring at a hard-to-reach spot, like tiny blood vessels in the brain or lungs? Some working group members focus their research questions on specific areas of the body. With Patel, Andrews is trying to understand whoâs most at risk for cognitive and physical impairments after COVID. Some patientsâ fatigue is related to muscle wasting, known medically as sarcopenia, and Andrews wants to know whatâs behind that and whoâs at risk. Role of the immune system in long COVID-19 Since it became understood that an overactive immune response (known as a âcytokine stormâ) lurks behind some of COVID-19âs most dire complications, scientists have begun digging deeper into how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2. Macnofsky herself participated in a Benaroya Research Institute study looking at the immune response to the novel coronavirus. Bender Ignacio's working group is drawing on the Hutchâs longstanding expertise in immunology and infectious diseases and looking to the immune system for answers. âWeâre studying what natural infection looks like over time,â said Fred Hutch immunologist Dr. Maria Lemos, who studies immune responses in mucosal tissue like vaginal and nasal surfaces, where we first encounter many viruses. âPeople could have cold symptoms for nine days, then four moths later theyâre diagnosed with a lung condition or a heart condition.â To understand why, she and others on McElrathâs team are mapping the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection as it unfolds over months. With collaborators at Emory University in Atlanta, theyâre charting the rise and fall of antibodies against the virus and how different immune-cell populations grow, shrink and morph over time. By describing how these responses differ between people who did and did not develop long COVID-19, the researchers hope to identify key biomarkers, like specific inflammatory proteins, that help predict which patients will have persistent problems. Such biological predictors could help doctors intervene early, either to help connect patients with the right services to help them deal with symptoms, or (once scientists crack this problem) stave it off entirely. McElrathâs team, with collaborators at Emory University and the Seattle-basedÂ Allen Institute for Immunology, has revealed some tantalizing immunological patterns, Lemos said, which the group posted on the preprint server biorxiv.org. The immune trajectory in many long-haulers looks startlingly unlike that seen in people who recover quickly and permanently. âThe alarm system of the immune system doesnât get turned on as quickly in these people â but surprisingly it seems to remain on for way longer,â Lemos said. Theyâre currently putting together a paper for peer review at a scientific journal. On top of this project, Moodie is working with investigators the Allen Institute to identify immunological signatures, including cellular features like proteins and gene expression, that distinguish long COVID-19 from acute COVID-19. Some patients â including Macnofsky â report improvement of symptoms after vaccination for COVID-19, and Moodie and her collaborators want to understand how vaccination may help their bodies resolve their chronic, damaging immune responses. (Whether prior COVID-19 vaccination helps protect against developing long COVID-19 is still being explored. A recent study in The Lancet suggests that vaccinated people are less likely to have long-lasting symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection.) Robin Macnofsky in 2019, before COVID-19 (left).

Macnofsky said sheâs recently been helped by six months of weekly pulmonary rehab sessions. Itâs possible that early access to rehabilitative therapies could help prevent or alleviate severe long COVID-19 in others. It is taking time for scientists at the Hutch and elsewhere to get a clear enough picture of whatâs driving long COVID-19 to open clinical studies to address patientsâ problems, but a few have begun. The Seattle arm of aÂ multi-center, Phase 2 trialÂ of a drug calledÂ RSLV 132, is administered through the CCRC and headed by Andrews. (People interested in participating canÂ contact the CCRC.) Developed by biotech company Resolve Therapeutics, the drug has already shown promise against fatigue in people with autoimmune diseases like SjÃ¶gren syndrome, and scientists hope long COVID-19 patients will also benefit. âOne of the exciting things about this study is that itâs taking a targeted therapy approach to treating symptoms,â Andrews said. âItâs targeting the mechanism behind fatigue â chronic inflammation â to see if it helps.â In addition to testing whether RSLV 132 outperforms a placebo when it comes to alleviating fatigue in long COVID-19 patients, researchers will collect tissue samples that theyâll study to get a better picture of how it might be working (if it does), he said. If it turns out that some patients respond and some donât, such samples could also help investigators figure out why. And, if thereâs a similar biological process underpinning the fatigue seen in long COVID and other diseases and syndromes, the study could benefit a wide array of patients, Andrews said. Thatâs a hope that other members of the working group also harbor. One of the big questions, said Chow, is whether long COVID-19 patients are suffering from the same immunologic problems as patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune diseases, or other virus-associated chronic damage. Or is there something unique about the biology behind long COVID-19? Bender Ignacio sees potential for the close ties between the CCRC and the long COVID-19 working group to help fast-track promising treatments or treatment strategies that emerge from group membersâ projects. Â Working toward a more certain future One thing Chow hopes come from the studies is more predictability. Right now, clinicians struggle to determine whose symptoms will last, and whose will resolve. A better understanding of long COVID-19 subgroups will help clinicians guide patients toward the best therapies for them. Improving doctorsâ ability to diagnose and clinically characterize long COVID-19 will also help improve insurance reimbursement, he said. Right now, he stressed the need to recognize and validate what patients with long COVID-19 face. Macnofsky, who at one point couldnât take a phone call from a friend without falling back into a zombie sleep, feels fortunate. She joined Facebook groups organized by long COVID-19 sufferers, where many reported not just horrible symptoms but job loss and crushing debt. Macnofskyâs leave of absence from her career was fully supported â emotionally and financially â by her husband. Sheâs recovered enough now to step back into some job duties, though not at her previous level. But she knows other patients who continue to suffer, with no idea when â or if â their symptoms will ever improve. On top of everything else, her uncertain future is one of the biggest challenges Macnofsky faces Luckily, she said, her "keep calm and carry on" attitude (and compassionate family) are helping her ride her waves of symptoms. âThereâs a mental health component to being so ill,â Czartoski said. She still encourages patients to treat themselves gently and take it one day at a time. While most will improve with time, a few will worsen â and she still canât tell someone which patient theyâll be. The answer will only come with more data. âIâm still collecting everything I can,â Czartoski said.Â sabrina-richards Sabrina Richards, a staff writer at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, has written about scientific research and the environment for The Scientist and OnEarth Magazine.

Please also consider subscribing to WIREDIn the first days of the new year, on the marshy coastal edge of South Carolina’s Lowcountry, a hunter shot an American widgeon, a rusty-fronted duck with a pale beak and a brilliant green stripe. This was not a big deal; the state’s duck hunting season runs from Thanksgiving through the end of January. Neither was what happened next: Before taking it home, the hunter let a wildlife biologist affiliated with a government program swab the carcass for lab analysis.But what happened after that was a big deal indeed. After the sample went through its routine check at Clemson University, it made an unusual second stop at a federal lab halfway across the country, in Iowa. The news of what was in the sample percolated through a pyramid of agencies, and on January 14 the US Department of Agriculture revealed why it had attracted so much scrutiny: The South Carolina duck was carrying the Asian strain of H5N1 avian influenza, the first sighting of that pathogen in the continental US in years.But not the last. Just a few days later, the USDA disclosed that two more birds shot by hunters also carried the same pathogen: a teal, shot in the same South Carolina county, and a northern shoveler shot in the far northeast corner of North Carolina, about 400 miles away. The virus in all three was what is known as highly pathogenic—meaning it could cause fast-moving, fatal disease in other bird species, such as poultry, though it was not making the ducks ill.Three birds out of the millions that American hunters shoot each year might seem like nothing—but the findings have sent a ripple of disquiet through the community of scientists who monitor animal diseases. In 2015, that same strain of flu landed in the Midwest’s turkey industry and caused the largest animal-disease outbreak ever seen in the US, killing or causing the destruction of more than 50 million birds and costing the US economy more than $3 billion. Human-health experts are uneasy as well. Since 2003, that flu has sickened at least 863 people across the world and killed more than half of them. Other avian flu strains have made hundreds more people ill. Before Covid arrived, avian flu was considered the disease most likely to cause a transnational outbreak.It is far too soon to say whether the arrival of this virus in the US is a blip, an imminent danger to agriculture, or a zoonotic pathogen probing for a path to attack humanity. But it is a reminder that Covid is not the only disease with pandemic potential, and of how easy it is to lose focus when it comes to other possible threats. The possibility of a human- or animal-origin strain of flu swamping the world once seemed so imminent that back in 2005 the White House wrote a national strategy for it. But researchers say the surveillance schemes that would pick up its movement have since been allowed to drift.“In wildlife disease surveillance, we’re always chasing a crisis,” says David Stallknecht, director of the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, a research institute housed at the University of Georgia. “And as soon as the crisis is over, the interest goes down. It’s difficult to keep going long-term. People are here to do the work, but the money isn't there to support it.”Most PopularGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottSecurityInside the Massive Crime Industry That’s Hacking Billion-Dollar CompaniesBy Joseph CoxScienceInvasive Species Are Threatening the Quality of New York’s Tap WaterBy Lauren DalbanTo understand the importance of those three ducks and the virus they were carrying, we need to take a quick tour through Flu School. Lesson One: The flu virus family tree is vast and sprawling; it contains types—A, B, C, D—and subtypes, designated with Hs and Ns. (Those are short for proteins that let the virus infect cells.) Just within the As, there are almost 200 subtypes; a few affect humans, but almost all of them can infect birds.Lesson Two: For a long time, scientists thought humans were in little danger from all those other flu strains. That assumption was shattered in 1997, when an avian influenza, H5N1, jumped species in Hong Kong and infected 18 people, killing six of them. To shut it down, the local government slaughtered every chicken in the territory, denying the virus a host. That worked for a few years, but in 2003 H5N1 started to move across the world again, and it has been moving ever since.Lesson Three: Avian flu can be dangerous to people, but it threatens some birds too. Waterbirds, chiefly ducks, carry it without illness, but it makes chickens sick. Here again, there are subcategories: Avian flu can be low-pathogenic, meaning that it makes birds mildly ill and slows down egg production. Or it can be highly pathogenic, or high-path: a fast-moving infection so vicious that it can kill an entire flock in two days. (A prominent poultry researcher once called it “chicken Ebola.”)To sum all that up (there will not be a quiz): The flu found in the Carolinas is an H5N1, meaning it is of the subtype that normally infects birds but in the past has sickened people. It is a high-path variety, the kind that can wipe out domesticated flocks. It belongs to a strain related to that first species-crossing jump in 1997. And, to make matters worse, it represents just one instance of a remarkable amount of highly pathogenic H5N1 showing up in the world right now.Last year, the World Organization for Animal Health (known by its French acronym, OIE) estimated that between May 1 and November 1, 41 countries experienced outbreaks of highly pathogenic bird flu, with 16,000 isolations of the virus reported just in October. Fifteen countries also reported outbreaks between October and December.Most PopularGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottSecurityInside the Massive Crime Industry That’s Hacking Billion-Dollar CompaniesBy Joseph CoxScienceInvasive Species Are Threatening the Quality of New York’s Tap WaterBy Lauren DalbanOccasional isolations of avian flu in wild birds are not unusual, but last fall high-path H5N1 began erupting in the United Kingdom with extraordinary intensity. Since October and into this year, the virus has been found in wild species, including swans, geese, shorebirds, and birds of prey. But it has also invaded poultry farms, primarily in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. By January, more than 1 million chickens and other birds had been destroyed to stop it from spreading. In December, the UK’s chief veterinary officer called the occurrence of bird flu there “phenomenal,” saying the strain had spread to the largest number of farm properties ever seen.At almost the same moment, Dutch authorities were ordering the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of poultry on farms in the country. In the Czech Republic, more than 100,000 hens died of avian flu on an egg farm, and another 100,000 birds and about 1 million eggs were destroyed to stop the virus from spreading further. In France, farmers feared the virus would invade the duck-raising southwest, the home of foie gras. Last week, the agriculture ministry ordered 2.5 million birds killed. In Italy, more than 4 million poultry died or were slaughtered between October and December. And the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, the animal-disease research unit of the German government, said at the end of December that Europe was experiencing “the strongest avian influenza epidemic ever,” with cases reaching as far north as the Faroe Islands and as far south as Portugal.Those slaughter numbers should make the case that the flu is not only a threat to animal welfare, but an engine of economic damage as well. Rabobank, a financial services and analysis firm based in the Netherlands, has already predicted that these massive culls, layered on top of pandemic-fueled freight problems and rising feed costs, could inflate food prices this year.For the most part, birds stick to specific north-south migratory pathways and don’t fly laterally around the globe. So to scientists in North America, outbreaks of bird flu in Europe were a cause for worry, but not immediate alarm. But in December and again in January, high-path H5N1 was found in farms in Newfoundland, at the top of the migratory flyway that sweeps down the US coast. That is the same flyway that crosses over the Carolinas, where the virus-carrying ducks were caught—and also over the more than 1 billion chickens grown each year in Georgia, the most poultry-dense state in the US.Most PopularGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottSecurityInside the Massive Crime Industry That’s Hacking Billion-Dollar CompaniesBy Joseph CoxScienceInvasive Species Are Threatening the Quality of New York’s Tap WaterBy Lauren DalbanBecause this flu is highly pathogenic, the challenge is that there is no time for mitigation once it arrives in a flock. As Midwest turkey producers experienced in 2015, it blows up into a destructive epidemic overnight. That requires poultry farmers to harden their defenses now—and while that seems like an obvious task, it requires precision and cost in an industry that runs on thin margins and speed. Carol Cardona, a wildlife veterinarian and chair of avian health at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine, likens it to learning to live under Covid: Every daily action requires a calculation of risk and takes a little more patience than you can easily summon.“It’s the same for growing poultry,” she says. “How do we feed them without introducing a little bit of risk? How do we care for them? In normal times, when we don't have a threat, you can be more efficient in how you do things. But now things have to change. You have to be perfect all the time. That’s a lot of stress.”Scientists who monitor wildlife fret that there is something else going on in this wave of flu. Wild waterbirds are accidental transport vehicles for the virus, but rarely victims. They pick it up and transfer it to other birds in ponds and wetlands at the ends of their migration journeys and then carry it with them, unharmed, once they return to the skies. But in Israel, where more than a half-million poultry have died or been slaughtered, the first sign of trouble was a mass die-off of thousands of wild cranes in a wetland that lies directly under a migration route. The European Food Safety Authority has identified deaths from flu in at least 80 other species of wild birds, leaving scientists to wonder whether bird flu has evolved into a further threat.“The catastrophic issue economically is poultry,” Stallknecht says. “But we also have to be concerned with wildlife health. And there are some populations of shorebirds that are already not in good shape, so we need to be monitoring them also.”There’s also evidence these new waves of bird flu have been leaking into humans. In the first week of January, UK health authorities revealed that a man in Devon who kept ducks as pets had the country’s first-ever human case of H5N1 bird flu. The ducks were all slaughtered; the man was reported to be quarantined and surviving the infection but lonely and missing his birds. In November, the WHO said it has been monitoring a slow surge in human infections in China caused by a known but less common bird flu subtype, H5N6. By the end of 2021, there had been 26 people infected, one of whom died. And in February a year ago, the Russian government revealed that seven poultry farm workers fell ill (and recovered) from yet another subtype, H5N8.Most PopularGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottSecurityInside the Massive Crime Industry That’s Hacking Billion-Dollar CompaniesBy Joseph CoxScienceInvasive Species Are Threatening the Quality of New York’s Tap WaterBy Lauren DalbanOther bird-specific strains have been surging into humans as well. The Chinese government disclosed last June that a man who had no known contact with poultry developed an infection with a flu strain never before seen in humans, H10N3, and that he was hospitalized but recovered. Since 2013, China has recorded more than 1,600 human cases of yet another strain, H7N9.Though there have been notifications of those outbreaks—the regulations governing the WHO require countries to send immediate notification of high-path avian flu—they have not all included details about genetic sequences or spread. Researchers are hungry for answers. “The question is: What’s new?” says Daniel Lucey, an infectious-disease physician and senior scholar at Georgetown University’s ​​O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. “The quantity of outbreaks is massive, but has there been a change in qualitative risk? Have the sequences changed so the virus is more likely to infect humans? Can we document person-to-person spread?”A further concern lurks behind this bloom of bird flu. Until now, biologists have assumed the danger is seasonal, triggered by the movement of waterbirds as they migrate: If there are no visiting birds overhead, or on shores or in ponds, they can’t spread a virus to local birds or people. But researchers are beginning to wonder whether climate change is interfering with migration patterns. The typical pattern for bird flu infections has been for them to begin during the fall migrations and then continue through the winter and into spring. But in Germany last year, scientists were able to identify H5 viruses in wild birds throughout the summer, a first.It’s difficult for scientists to make the case for year-round surveillance and better financial support when they can’t say whether this wave of flu is a brief aberration or the first moments of a sustained emergency.

No, 'flurona' isn't real.Researchers have studied what happens when a human body is infected by two viruses, but it's not yet clear what happens to people who catch Covid and another contagion.Get more newsLiveonJan. 23, 2022, 9:30 AM UTC / Updated Jan. 24, 2022, 6:13 PM UTCBy Evan BushIt would have been hard to know in March 2020 that Covid-19 testing limitations in New York City would help lead doctors at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx to a fascinating surprise. Testing for Covid at the time was sluggish and expensive and in limited supply. Hospitals across the city were beginning to overfill. So doctors at the hospital often ordered several tests for patients, trying to identify — or eliminate from suspicion — other possible infections. First, they’d rule out influenza and RSV, common infections. Then, they’d test for Covid-19 and a slew of other viruses using the same sample at the same time. What they found was eye-opening. Over a month’s time, tests showed that nearly 5 percent of patients had not only Covid, but another viral respiratory infection, too. At first, doctors worried more for these patients, whose immune systems were fighting two battles at once. “What we found was actually that patients who had Covid plus another infection — they had lower rates of inflammation in their body and were less likely to be admitted to the hospital,” said Dr. Sarah Baron, a physician at the hospital who helped author a study in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy to describe the findings. Patients with more than one infection were actually faring better, their data suggest. The study is small and limited. It captures just 14 cases of simultaneous infection and left out influenza cases, and it prompts more questions than answers. But the research may offer an intriguing window into viral interference, when one virus suppresses the effects of another, and contribute to a growing body of evidence about how the phenomenon acts. Viruses can also enhance other infections and make people sicker, which has been documented in other studies of influenza and the common cold.Learning more about the complex interactions among viruses within the same host could help researchers better understand the complex patterns of epidemics.Masking, lockdowns and other restrictions slowed the spread of many common viruses. But as the world opens up and the omicron variant spreads rapidly, researchers are now positioned to untangle some of the mysteries of these interactions. Let’s clear the air: The word “flurona,” which has circulated on social media and refers to someone infected with both Covid and the flu, isn’t popular with scientists. “The contractions like ‘flurona,’ I think they’re very misleading to people. It presents the idea two viruses have somehow merged into one, which is not at all the case,” said Dr. Ellen Foxman, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine. “Somebody got a coinfection. People get coinfections all the time.”But these coinfections are rather interesting to researchers. When someone is infected with two viruses, there are three options for how it could play out. The interaction could cause little or no effect, researchers said. Or the viruses could attack simultaneously, causing more damage than they would on their own. Coinfection could “lead to increased viral replication and increased severity,” said Dr. Guy Boivin, a clinical virologist in Quebec City. Boivin co-authored a review of viral interference from Laval University that was published this month in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the journal of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.It’s a third option — which seems counterintuitive — that is perhaps most intriguing. If infections are closely spaced in time, it’s possible for one infection to block another, researchers say. Scientists think infection by the first virus puts your body’s immune system on heightened alert, triggering the secretion of a protein called interferon. This is an innate immune response that is generalized and doesn’t require prior memory of the viral invader.Once they’re secreted, interferon proteins begin a process that can prevent viruses from replicating, research suggests.“It will create a state where your antiviral response is turned on for days to probably a week,” Foxman said. When the timing is just right, the interferon response triggered by an initial infection could prevent a second virus from replicating, too.Some viruses can delay the interferon response; others seem to trigger it almost immediately. “What varies a lot from virus to virus is the magnitude and timing — how much a virus triggers interferon and how fast a virus triggers interferon,” Foxman said.Researchers have known about viral interference since the 1960s, when a Soviet group of scientists noticed that a live vaccine against polio and other enteroviruses also seemed to protect against unrelated viral respiratory diseases like influenza. Further research documented a variety of possible connections between one virus and another, some that were tested in animals or laboratory work and others that were observed in the patterns of disease outbreaks. Several research groups suspect that viral interference altered the timing of H1N1 influenza’s spread across Europe in the winter of 2009. Rhinovirus may have delayed the H1N1 pandemic in France by several weeks, one group reported. Other research found that outbreaks of influenza seemed to lower the odds of detecting RSV. Foxman’s research suggests that a recent common cold infection — from rhinoviruses — could stop replication of the virus that causes Covid-19. Rhinoviruses, which circulate widely, are relatively benign for most people and prompt a near-immediate interferon response, Foxman said. “Would you really want to cure the common cold? I’m not sure you would,” Foxman said. “You might be opening up the door for a worse virus that wants to occupy the same niche — your nose.” Foxman said no one should seek a cold infection to avoid Covid.But learning more about viral interference could help prepare for future pandemics. Further research into the patterns of disease could improve pandemic prediction models and help public health officials know when it’s time to introduce protective measures like masks, Boivin said. He also sees potential in developing therapeutics that use defective versions of viruses to prompt innate immune responses. Other researchers view those efforts with some skepticism, because interferon responses tend to be short and predicting when someone might be at risk for infection is difficult. “I’m not sure what practical application this would have as an antiviral,” said Susan Weiss, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania.Previous efforts to harness the power of the innate immune system haven’t worked out. In the 1980s, researchers became excited about using daily nasal sprays of interferon to prevent the common cold. But the side effects ended up being about as bad as the cold itself, Foxman said, noting that the innate immune system is a “double-edged sword” if it’s overstimulated. Masks, lockdowns and other preventive measures have stopped many viruses from circulating widely over the last 22 months. As those restrictions are loosened and the omicron variant spreads rapidly, the probability that someone will be infected with the virus that causes Covid and another virus at the same time is expected to increase, which makes it an interesting time for research. “In normal life, there’s quite a bit of respiratory virus circulation. I would expect we’re going to be seeing that soon,” Foxman said, adding that it’s a unique time to study viral interference. “Scientists are getting interested now. I think we’ll learn about this in the coming years.” It’s a difficult topic to study. People who are very sick might be more likely to seek or receive testing that identifies multiple infections. Cases in which one virus prevents another from replicating and causing severe illness will be harder to pick up. Some scientists have warned that as masks come off and social patterns go back to normal, other respiratory viruses could come roaring back. Foxman’s hypothesis is that as society opens up, the viral interference phenomenon could keep some of those simmering viruses from boiling up all at once. “Maybe that’s something we can think about when opening things up again as a mitigating factor for the population not to have too many things going around at once,” Foxman said. “It’s somewhat reassuring, in a way.” Evan BushEvan Bush is a science reporter for NBC News.

In the show, a flu with a 99% fatality rate and no incubation period wipes out the world. Could that really happen? By Nicole Karlis Senior Writer Published January 27, 2022 3:03PM (EST) Himesh Patel in "Station Eleven" (Ian Watson/HBO Max) -- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email In "Station Eleven," what's left of humanity exists in a post-apocalyptic world after a very deadly flu outbreak kills most humans 20 years prior to when the show begins. The HBO Max series is based on the 2014 novel of the same name by Emily St. John Mandel, written way back when COVID-19 was just a twinkle in a bat (or a pangolin's) bloodstream. Though it might feel a bit too close-to-home to watch mid-pandemic, the limited series does showcase some survival skills for a worst-case scenario of complete social collapse amid a pandemic. Plus, while there are some painful parallels between today's pandemic and "Station Eleven," there is relief in knowing that COVID-19 is nowhere near as socially destructive as the catastrophic flu of the book and TV show. Indeed, the fictional flu in "Station Eleven," which is dubbed the "Georgia flu," has a 99 percent fatality rate and thus offers its victims little hope of survival. Not only is it super-deadly, but the characters explain that it has "no incubation period," presumably meaning it starts spreading immediately after someone contracts it. On the show, people die within hours of showing symptoms — at their steering wheels, or while performing on stage, like one of the main characters, Arthur Leander. The rapid spread and high death rate results in a total collapse of civilization within months, as electricity, water and the internet cease to function. Those who do survive do so by luck or foresight — either because they had the resources to quarantine themselves for months in their homes, or because they were stranded at an airport and never left. Science fiction is meant to stretch what is feasibly possible, and "Station Eleven" is not highly fantastical sci-fi by any stretch of the imagination. But how much science is in this fictional world? In other words, could an influenza virus experience an antigenic drift (small mutation) that could match what's depicted in "Station Eleven?" "Scientists just always hesitate to say 'never' because that's such a large word, but essentially, never could we anticipate that there would be a pathogen that has characteristics, each of which are so extreme, that it's at the very end of what we think can happen on occasion," said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "It's never from an evolutionary perspective in the pathogen's interest to kill every human being or every animal that it infects, because very quickly it will run out of people to infect and that has no evolutionary advantage to the virus — because all of a sudden it will come to a dead end."

Indeed, it is generally understood among scientists that viruses usually evolve to become more transmissible — not more lethal. Schaffner pointed to the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 as an example. "You can have an extraordinarily contagious virus, we see that right now with COVID," Schaffner said, noting that COVID-19 is close to being the "most contagious virus ever studied." "But even so, it has limitations," he added. Leonard Mermel, a professor of medicine at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, agreed. "It would not make evolutionary sense for a pathogen to have 99% mortality towards its primary host," Mermel said. "If a pathogen killed just about all their hosts, it would be unlikely to pass on those genes, as the hosts would die and so would they." Mermel added that in the case of deadly flus, humans often aren't the primary host of many viral flu strains. "As is the case with avian (bird) flu infecting humans, mortality can be high — such as ~50% mortality with H5N1 infections in humans," Mermel said. RELATED: HBO Max's must-watch "Station Eleven" brings comfort and joy after the eerily familiar apocalypse And what about the fictional virus' lack of incubation time? Is it possible for a deadly flu to have no incubation time? "Well, if there's no incubation time, that means from the moment of exposure to the moment of developing symptoms, that would be very, very brief," Schaffner said. "Now one of the things that that would do for the virus, that's to the virus' disadvantages, is that would immediately make that person sick and not able to get around as frequently — therefore, it would make it harder for the virus to spread." Schaffner explained that COVID-19 and the flu usually are infectious for 24 hours or more before a person actually feels sick, allowing an infected person to move around and come into contact with people and spread the virus. Mermel agreed that the idea of no incubation period "does not make sense." "An infectious agent such as a respiratory virus like flu must be deposited on a mucous membrane (mouth, nose, eyes) and then invade a susceptible cell, utilize its genetic material to build many virions in that cell, then release those viruses to infect other cells, etc.," Mermel said. "So this takes time accounting for what we call an incubation period." Mermel said that the only way to avoid an incubation period from an infectious agent is via "toxin production." "Some forms of food poisoning such as from staph or bacillus cereus occur just hours after a contaminated meal due to the effect of the toxin rather than the bacteria infecting cells and reproducing and infecting others cells and so on," Mermel said. "However, toxin production to the best of my knowledge is not part of human viral infections." Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease doctor and professor of medicine at the University of California–San Francisco, agreed. "There is always an incubation period," Gandhi said. "I can't see this ever happening." In other words, doomsday preppers shouldn't see "Station Eleven's" Georgia flu as a prophecy. The fictitious flu virus fails the realism test.

The WHO cautioned against treating Covid-19 as flu. Getty Images Key Facts Dr. David Nabarro, the World Health Organization's special envoy for Covid-19, told the U.K.’s Sky News the virus is not like flu and should not be treated as such. England is dropping face mask and Covid passport requirements this week and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people "must learn to live with Covid in the same way we live with flu." Nabarro said the coronavirus is a new virus and we should treat it “as though it is full of surprises, very nasty and rather cunning.” The statement comes as governments around the world—including Spain, the U.K., Ireland and Japan—drop restrictions and begin treating Covid-19 as an endemic illness like the flu. However, from what people see and report to the WHO, Nabarro said it is “still a very, very dangerous virus” and criticized governments that suggest this has suddenly changed, adding that he wonders what the people making these optimistic predictions know that he and the rest of the WHO don’t. Nabarro said Covid-19 is particularly dangerous “for people who have not been vaccinated and who've not been exposed to it before,” and noted it can mutate into new variants. Key Background Controversial political leaders and commentators—including former President Donald Trump, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro and a string of Fox News pundits—have compared Covid-19 to the flu since it first started spreading, typically to downplay the severity of the coronavirus. While some symptoms are similar and both are respiratory illnesses, Covid-19 is often more severe and kills more than flu, the impact of which is also downplayed in comparisons. Seasonal influenza kills up to 650,000 people a year and there were three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, one of which killed an estimated 50 million people. High rates of omicron infections—which reached record levels in many countries—with relatively low levels of hospitalizations and deaths compared to previous variants, has revived the comparison, with leaders like Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez calling for a debate on whether Covid-19 should be treated as an endemic—a regular and more predictable illness—disease like flu. Sanchez confirmed reports his administration is drafting a new monitoring system where not every infection will be recorded and not everybody with symptoms will be tested. Spain’s policies are in line with reports from other countries in Europe like the U.K., but also in typically stricter regions like Asia, such as Japan. Crucial Quote Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House’s chief medical advisor, said the complete eradication—of Covid-19 is unlikely but it hopefully will settle and become one of the diseases we experience in a more manageable way like flu. "I think that's what most people feel when they talk about in endemicity, where it is integrated into the broad range of infectious diseases that we experience," he said last week. Smallpox is the only infectious disease that infects humans to have ever been eradicated Further Reading Fauci says COVID-19 won't go away like smallpox, but will more likely become endemic (NPR) Europe Kicks Off Some Of The World’s Most Sweeping Vaccine Mandates And Fines (Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Read hereThe best response was seen when an RNA vaccine was given as a booster after the standard schedule of Sinovac's CoronaVac LivemintUpdated24 Jan 2022, 07:33 PM ISTVials of Chinese Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccine against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pictured inside the production lab designated to manufacture the vaccine, in Constantine, Algeria . REUTERS/Ramzi Boudina/File Photo(REUTERS)A study has revealed that if a person is administered Covid-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca-Oxford, Pfizer-BioNTech or Johnson & Johnson as a booster dose, that is, after receiving the two doses of Covid inactivated virus vaccine from Sinovac, would significantly increase the number of antibodies in that person. The CoronaVac, also known as the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine, is an inactivated virus Covid-19 vaccine developed by the Chinese company Sinovac Biotech.The “mix-and-match" booster approach induced stronger antibody protection against both delta and omicron, compared with a third dose of Sinovac’s vaccine, known as CoronaVac, the study showed.Earlier World Health Organisation (WHO)' s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) had issued interim recommendations for the use of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine against Covid-19.The UN health agency had said, “To ensure equivalent or favourable immunogenicity or vaccine effectiveness either of the WHO EUL COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) or the WHO EUL COVID-19 vectored vaccines (AstraZeneca Vaxzevria/COVISHIELD or Janssen) can be used as a second dose following a first dose with the Sinovac vaccine dependant on product availability.”The best response was seen when an RNA vaccine was given as a booster after the standard schedule of Sinovac's CoronaVac, researchers from Oxford University said on Monday, adding that the responses were seen against the Delta and Omicron coronavirus variants too. On 22 January, a study by researchers from Brazil and the University of Oxford revealed that people who had two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine made by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. should get boosted with a different shot to amp up their protection against omicron.Booster shots are being administered to the most vulnerable groups around the world, as Omicron variant of coronavirus fuels the third Covid wave of the pandmeic bringing everything to a stand still.

Annual Survey Highlights Hot Topics for Facility Cleaning Managers News & Views 1/27/2022 Flu Rates Down Overall After Holiday Peak Sponsors On a bi-weekly basis, we report on the progression of the flu season, highlighting states that are a rising threat, ones that could be looming, or ones showing signs of improvement after a rough patch of case rates. With infection control being pivotal to reopening facilities and keeping schools open, it's important to keep tabs on not only COVID-19 activity, but influenza rates as well. Doing so gives facility managers the information they need to craft infection control policies for their particular situation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which provides updating information with their “Weekly U.S. Influenza Report” rates states on 6-tier scale: Very High, High, Moderate, Low, Minimal, and Insufficient data. After an unsurprising holiday peak in our most recent coverage showing results from Jan 1. (Week 52 of the Flu Season calendar), information collected on Jan. 15 (Week 2) shows considerable a drop off in the majority of formerly high-risk states. After a whopping nine jurisdictions classified as “Very High” at the beginning of January — North Dakota, New Mexico, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia, South Carolina, New York City, and New Jersey — only New Mexico remains in the top tier of activity levels. Several of those aforementioned jurisdictions now settle in at “High” (North Dakota, Georgia, Virginia, indicating a slow but promising trend in the right direction. \ New Jersey and New York in particular have made impressive progress over the month of January, settling in at “Moderate” and “Low” respectively. At the turn of the New Year, New Jersey had the highest levels of flu activity of all 55 jurisdictions. Regardless of current regional risk, a proactive approach to infection control works best. The promotion of handwashing, disinfecting high-touch surfaces frequently and correct product selection are all critical components.

Photograph by Mark Mirko | mmirko@courant.comExpandBy Alex Putterman and Hartford CourantUPDATED: January 28, 2022 at 10:55 PM ESTAfter recording almost no influenza activity last winter, Connecticut has seen a return of the flu in recent months, albeit in lower quantities than the state typically experienced before the COVID-19 pandemic.As of Jan. 8, the most recent date for which data is available, Connecticut had seen 76 hospitalizations and three deaths related to the flu this winter, up from 14 hospitalizations and one death during last year’s entire flu season. Though dwarfed by COVID-19, the flu is circulating once again, experts said.“The overwhelming infection that we’re still seeing is COVID, but we’re definitely seeing flu this year,” Dr. Jeannie Kenkare, chief medical officer at PhysicianOne Urgent Care, said Monday. “Last year we saw almost nothing, and this year we’re seeing quite a bit more flu.”That doesn’t mean, however, that Connecticut has experienced the “twindemic” of COVID-19 and flu that some officials warned about last fall.As of now, the state’s flu numbers this winter don’t come close to figures reported in pre-pandemic flu seasons. In 2018-19, for example, Connecticut recorded 3,506 flu-related hospitalizations and 88 deaths, according to the Department of Public Health, after 3,895 flu hospitalizations and 184 deaths the year before.“We’ve certainly had more [flu] compared to last year, but compared to a typical year it is still much, much, much lower,” Dr. Ulysses Wu, chief epidemiologist at Hartford HealthCare, said.Connecticut’s trends have followed those recorded nationally. A typical flu season, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates, results in anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 deaths in the U.S. After about 700 deaths last winter, the country has recorded between 1,100 and 3,200 so far this flu season, per the CDC.Experts say the fluctuation in flu transmission appears to be tied to human behavior. Last winter, when masks were required indoors across Connecticut and many businesses were forced to reduce capacity, the flu barely spread at all. This winter, with those restrictions gone but many residents still taking precautions, it has returned in small quantities. Connecticut has seen more flu cases this winter than last but not nearly as many as in previous flu seasons. Photograph by Mark Mirko | mmirko@courant.comDr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at Yale New Haven Hospital, noted that Connecticut had been on track for something like a typical flu season until COVID-19 cases began to spike in December due to the omicron variant and residents stepped up their safety measures.“In what we would expect right now to be the peak of flu season, we’re going down sharply,” Roberts said. “We were really on track to be a pretty severe flu season as recently as one month ago, and then when Connecticut locked down for omicron, that’s when we started to see these rates plummet, and now we’re one-tenth of what we were in 2019 for this week.”LifestyleRoberts said he expects flu cases to increase again once the current COVID-19 surge passes and precautions ease. It’s possible, he said, that flu could spike in February and March.Some experts say the near disappearance of flu during last winter and parts of this winter has changed how they view virus prevention more broadly. In the future, they say, they may suggest that those particularly vulnerable to the flu — such as older people and those with severe underlying conditions — to wear masks in high-risk settings during the winter.“The data is undeniable that masking, among other interventions we’ve done such as social distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings, has been remarkably effective at reducing not just COVID but all respiratory viruses,” Roberts said. “I’ve learned a lot about how these measures have been at reducing respiratory infection, and I think some of this should be continued post-pandemic.”Others aren’t sure much will change at all.Kenkare emphasized the importance of flu vaccination and said she hopes uptake will improve in future years but said otherwise she expects flu will return to its typical levels once the COVID-19 pandemic ends and residents return to their previous lifestyles.“Unfortunately, I think people’s behaviors are going to revert back to previous behaviors,” Kenkare said. “In a year, two years for now, I think people will be back to where we used to be, and hopefully we can actually get back to those types of things, but what comes with that is the normal course of infection.”Alex Putterman can be reached at aputterman@courant.com.

Email Address Follow Now Commentary How it ends? By craigmedred on January 26, 2022 • ( 38 Comments ) The history of the flu/American Journal of Public Health, Peter Doshi With the World Health Organization (WHO) on Sunday suggesting 60 percent of Europe could be infected with the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by March, it’s a good time to take a look back at the history of the flu and ask a few questions about masks. The past is rarely a perfect blueprint for the future, and a coronavirus such as SARS-CoV-2 is different from an influenza virus, but the past is often a prologue for the future and SARS-CoV-2 is to date tracking along the lines influenza followed in the wake of the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-19. But first a question about the masks and face coverings that a variety of countries around the globe, including the United States, have pushed as the life preservers of the COVID-19 pandemic driven by the constantly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus. The virus has now moved on from the more deadly Delta variant to the more contagious but less deadly Omicron variant, and this is one of several important points being made about the latter. “Because the proportion of cases that are asymptomatic or mild has increased compared with previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, the global infection-detection rate has declined globally from 20 percent to 5 percent,” The Lancet, a highly respected medical journal, reported last week. “Understanding the burden of omicron depends crucially on the proportion of asymptomatic infections. A systematic review based on previous SARS-CoV-2 variants suggested that 40 percent of infections were asymptomatic. Evidence suggests that the proportion of asymptomatic infections is much higher for Omicron, perhaps as high as 80 to 90 percent.” So if 60 percent of heavily masked Europe is going to be known to be infected by March, and if 80 or 90 percent of the rest of the population is likely to be infected but not know it because they have no symptoms, does that mean that without masks everyone in Europe would be infected? Because the numbers here work out to an infection rate of over 90 percent if these things are true. And The Lancet did more or less suggest just about everyone is going to get infected with or without masks and/or vaccines. “Surprisingly, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) models suggest that the transmission intensity of omicron is so high that policy actions – increasing mask use, expanding vaccination coverage in people who have not been vaccinated, or delivering third doses of COVID-19 vaccines — taken in the next weeks will have limited impact on the course of the omicron wave,” the Institute’s Christopher JL Murray wrote for the Lancet. “IHME estimates suggest that increasing use of masks to 80 percent of the population, for example, will only reduce cumulative infections over the next four months by 10 percent. Increasing COVID-19 vaccine boosters or vaccinating people who have not yet been vaccinated is unlikely to have any substantial impact on the omicron wave because by the time these interventions are scaled up the omicron wave will be largely over.” All of this comes at a time when the U.S. government’s response to the pandemic has been focused on efforts to force Americans to get vaccinated, boosted and masked. President Joe Biden last week trumpeted a plan to distribute 400 million, high-quality N95 masks for free, and CNN reported an “administration official” Monday said that “last week masks began shipping and arriving at pharmacies and grocers around (the) country. We expect that throughout the week the number of stores and N95s arriving to scale up significantly.” The story echoed the Centers for Disease Control position that “masking is a critical public health tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and it is important to remember that any mask is better than no mask.” People versus peoples There is some evidence to support the belief that masks offer some protection at the individual level, and N95s are the gold standard for masks. But the evidence that masks do much of anything at the population level remains thin due to a lack of research and testing. There are “models” suggesting great public benefits from masking, and for people who must use public transportation or work in closed spaces potentially full of SARS-CoV-2 pathogens, there are really no options other than masking to try to get some protection. The two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) done on masks, however, have shown little or no benefit, and testing of masks in mask-test dummies (more on this to follow) concluded masks could make things worse. You’ve likely read nothing about the latter study because it challenges the conventional wisdom. As to the RCTs – RCTs being the gold standard of medical testing – both attracted considerable attention along with debate as to their meaning. The first, in Denmark, concluded masks did nothing, but the authors conceded that because infections rates were low at the time the trial was conducted they couldn’t dismiss the possibility masks might help in some situations. The second, in Bangladesh, found an 11 percent reduction in infections in a masked population versus an unmasked one based on the infection of 7.63 percent of the people in the masked group and 8.6 percent of the peole in the control group. Some argued this showed masks of great benefit. Others argued the opposite. You can form your own opinion based on the numbers. Now, to the study of how masks actually work that got almost no media attention anywhere. It was conducted by engineers in India who did what engineers for General Motors did in the early 1970s to allow for the testing of seat belts, they created a crash-test dummy. Or, in this case, a mask-test dummy. They built a sprayer that could be adjusted to mimic “normal breathing, coughing (and) sneezing, and installed it in the head of a manikin, they reported. They then used the manikin “to replicate the spray similar to that of an actual cough or sneeze as explained before by matching the parameters like droplet size, velocity range, and spray size. The main objective is to check for the penetration characteristics and get comprehensive insights into the spray impingement and penetration phenomena. An actual spray is used for impingement in (the) current study instead of (a) single droplet, which has been investigated in our previous work.” Their study was published online at MedRxiv, the preprint server for health sciences, on Nov. 28. MedRxiv is not peer-reviewed. Much of the science surrounding the rapidly and steadily evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus has been published first there, and none of it has been peer-reviewed. Which MedRxiv studies attract media attention appear to some degree influenced by what is politically correct, and masks have become politically correct (PC). The Indian study was not PC. Very few health professionals have been willing to publicly question maskings. Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist for the Swedish public health authority was one of the few who did. In April 2020, he warned that masks could create a false sense of security. “It is very dangerous to try to believe that masks are a silver bullet,” he messaged the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only to be taken to task by Science magazine months later. Sweden’s “cumulative death rate since the beginning of the pandemic rivals that of the United States, with its shambolic response,” Berlin-based reporter Gretchen Vogel wrote there. “And the virus took a shocking toll on the most vulnerable.” Tegnell has admitted to a failure in protecting the elderly in Swedish care homes, but he has not wavered in his position on masking as generally unhelpful if not dangerous. And as of today, the death rate in Sweden since the start of the pandemic stands at 153 per 1`00,000, significantly lower than the U.S. at 266 per 100, according to the Worldometer tracker. Sweden is generally in line with the rest of Europe with death rates in Hungary (426/100,000), Poland (275/100,000), Belguim (247/100,000), Italy (239/100,000), the United Kingdom (225/100,000), Greece (220/100,000) Spain (197/100,000), France (196/1`00,00), Austria (154/100,000) and a few other countries higher, death rates in Switzerland (145/100,000) and Germany (140/100,000) near statistically the same; and the numbers in the Netherlands (123/100,000), Denmark (62/100,000) and Norway (which largely closed its borders but like Sweden did not widely mask at 29/100,000) and a few other countries lower. These wide differences between European countries mimic those in the U.S. states where there is a more than fourfold difference between the 361 per 100,000 dead in Mississippi and the 81 per 100,000 dead in Hawaii. A peer-reviewed study of death rates in 30 different industrialized countries published in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism last February concluded these big differences were best “explained by differences in obesity rates, population health, population densities, age demographics, delays in imposing national virus control measures, per capita gross domestic product and climate (in that order).” The national virus control measure that appears to have worked best is keeping people away from each other. Infection and death rates throughout the various waves of the pandemic have gone up as people started mingling and gone down when, worried about the spreading virus, they spent less time mingling. Social animals The mingle factor is a huge confounder in trying to find any effect as to mask as University of Vermont researchers who appeared of the opinion masks help. After studying them, however, they came to this conclusion: COVID-19 cases were not related to masks but to “the number of contacts with adults and seniors, particularly contacts with people who are themselves COVID-19 positive. The factors that predict contacts, in turn, are working environment, living environment and, disturbingly, regularly wearing a mask outside of work. This study reinforces the concerns about risks for persons who have high levels of public contact during the pandemic.” How could this be possible? Well, according to the engineers at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and a participating colleague at the University of California San Diego, it could be because masks don’t magically make SARS-CoV-2 viruses disappear. Now, admittedly these are engineers, and the “follow-the-science” preachers in the U.s. appear to think one should only listen to epidemiologists on the subject of SARS-CoV-2, interdisciplinary science apparently having gone out of vogue. Whatever the case, the engineers did build a model, masked it, pumped virus-size nanoparticles into the mask and discovered that the masks do a nice job of blocking the spittle that is a part of every human breath, but not the viruses contained in the spittle. “It is evident from the data that the droplets of different sizes atomize into even smaller daughter droplets, resulting in significant aerosolization,” they wrote. Aerosols are the itsy-bitsy particles that can stay suspended in the air for considerable lengths of time and thus cover considerable distances. To study what this means, the engineers put their mannikins face to face and let one cough on the other. After studying the results, they concluded that simple, single-layer masks are “not sufficient to reduce the risk of infection even if the single-layer masks are worn by both infected and susceptible person. Thus, the experiments clearly suggest the necessity of the need of multiple layers as well as social distancing in mitigating the spread of contagious respiratory diseases.” The masks did entrap some particles. Whether the entrapment was significant, the researchers said, requires more study. And they added that this aspect “mandates the necessity to follow proper disposal methods for handling face masks after utilization.” Anyone who has observed the behavior of masked humans these days knows how careless people have become in their handling of masks. Masks are often more for show than health. It wouldn’t be at all surprising if there is someone out there now who became infected by borrowing a mask from someone else so they could be appropriately “dressed” to rush into a store in communities where masking was mandated. Actually, it wouldn’t be surprising if any number of people ended up infected in this way. Meanwhile, you might have noticed people’s hands are all over their masks all the time, and afterward, their hands are all over other things. Given this, maybe it shouldn’t be a surprise that infections with the Omicron variant – which recent research discovered survives for a much longer than earlier variants on human hands and plastic – have exploded around the world. The study in India, it should be noted, was conducted before the even-more contagious Omicron variant emerged. And given that developing COVID-19 after exposure to any SARS-CoV-2 appears to be “dose-related,” as many things are, the infectiveness of Omicron might be an important element in its rapid spread. If it causes more disease at a lower dose, that change might well mask any progress masks were making in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 – if masks were making any progress. Be thankful then that Omicron appears less deadly than the SARS-CoV-2 variants that proceeded it. There is now worldwide agreement that is the case, but considerable debate about whether the next variants will be more or less virulent than Omicron, which is where the history of the flu becomes interesting. The forgotten epidemics The devastation of the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918-19 is hard to imagine even with what is going on today. In a peer-reviewed study of influenza from 1900 to 2018, published in Infectious Disease Modeling last June, University of Toronto (Canada) researcher Michele Campolieti put the U.S. death rate for that influenza outbreak at 589.6 per 100,000. That is more than twice the death rate in the U.S. for Covid-19as of today, according to the Worldometer tracker, and more than 60 percent higher than the 361.4 per 100,000 death rate in Mississippi, the state hardest hit by the current pandemic. Given the nightmare of the Spanish flu, the years that followed with flu death rates near 150 per 100,000 have been forgotten. Alaska’s present death rate of 142 per 100,000 would have been almost normal in those years. Campolieti’s data shows mortality pushing near to 150 deaths per 100,000 for four years in the 1920s, and it pushed near 125 per 100,000 again in 1935 but there was through all the waves that following 1918-19 a constant, downward trend. “…The mortality rates for influenza (including pneumonia) show a steady decline during the first half of the 20th century before leveling off in the 1950s,” she wrote, echoing the observations of MIT researcher Peter Doshi who in 2008 penned a history of the flu from 1900 to 2004 for the American Journal of Public Health. Doshi’s work reflected what a wildlife ecologist might describe as a species’ natural adaptation to a new pathogen. The average seasonal rate once near 100 deaths per 100,000 in the 1920s fell to an average “rate of 10.2 deaths per 100 000 population in the 1940s (and) to 0.56 per 100,000 by the 1990s,” he observed. From the 1920s on, he wrote, pandemic years – pandemic being defined by the arrival of a new virus and not the number of people dead – “do not stand out as exceptional outliers, nor were these pandemics visually discernable from nonpandemics in seasonal or monthly influenza mortality graphs. In fact, although nonpandemic influenza seasonal death rates never exceeded prior pandemic seasonal death rates, many nonpandemic seasons were more deadly than subsequent pandemics.” But there was that always trending downward in deaths despite annual ups and downs. Doshi attributed this to natural adaptations. “The overall decline in influenza-attributed mortality over the 20th century cannot be the result of influenza vaccination, because vaccination did not become available until the 1940s and was not widely used until the late 1980s,” he wrote. “This rapid decline, which commenced around the end of World War II, points to the possibility that social changes led to a change in the ecology of influenza viruses.” The death rate in these 60 years fell from the nearly 589 deaths per 100,000 during the Spanish flu to less than one per 100,000 by the start of the 1990s when doctors began to heavily push flu vaccines. “I found that declining mortality rates occurred simultaneously with expanded influenza vaccine coverage since 1980, especially for the elderly (65 years and older),” Doshi said. “However, recent research suggests that vaccination is an unlikely explanation of mortality trends. A 2005 US National Institutes of Health study of over 30 influenza seasons ‘could not correlate increasing vaccination coverage after 1980 with declining mortality rates in any age group.’ “Other research has reviewed available international studies of inactivated influenza vaccine effectiveness and efficacy. One study concluded that ‘evidence from systematic reviews shows that inactivated vaccines have little or no effect on the effects measured.’ Considered in light of the data presented here, these studies imply that other causes – such as an improvement in living conditions or naturally acquired immunity from similar strains of influenza virus – may have been partially responsible for the declining trends in recorded influenza mortality.” Or, there could be still other factors. Focusing too intently on vaccines, Doshi warned more than a decade ago, “risks overlooking other significant microbial and nonmicrobial host and environmental factors that influence the course of human disease. The severity and clinical expression of disease depend on a multiplicity of additional factors, such as the novelty of the pathogen to the host, age, cocirculating pathogens, living conditions, physiological status, and access to treatment.” Some of those factors – most notably a new novel pathogen in the form of SARS-CoV-2, an older population thanks to improvements in health care, higher density living conditions in some hard-hit places like New Jersey and declining physiological status – have now come back to boost the death rate in the Covid-19 pandemic, which has focused heavily on people with comorbidities and those of middle-age and older. As of Monday, Centers for Disease Control data showed that 98.82 percent of the more than 848,000 Americans whose deaths are blamed on Covid-19 were over the age of 40 and 88.75 percent of the deaths were among people over age 50. And the majority of these people were suffering with physiological weaknesses ranging from metabolic disease linked to obesity to high-blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and more before they were infected. The one thing that could be said at the start of the pandemic in early 2020 is even more true of the pandemic now: It is not killing the young and the fit; it is predominately killing the old and the weak. Which is, sadly, sort of how nature works no matter how humankind might like to believe that it’s moved beyond nature.

The news variant omicron wave is a disaster. Currently 500,000 thousand infected I believe. 1,000+ in critical condition. 600 more dead in last aprx 30 days . That rate is pretty extreme and its due Omicron. 30-50 dying each day in last aprx week . That rate is significant. Its as bad as before. Infection rates are worse. The vacines snd masks have not done the job. You were wrong in your suggestion that omicron wasn’t a problem regarding desth for Israelis. Aprx 7-8.% of total have now died in one month.

For people near death already, it sometimes doesn’t take much of a respiratory infection to push them over the edge as has long been the case with the flu in this country. Flu deaths are thought to be undercounted because, as one study put it, “many influenza-associated deaths occur one or two weeks after the initial infection (when viral shedding has ended), either because of secondary bacterial infections12–14 or because the influenza has exacerbated chronic illnesses (e.g., congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).” There seems little doubt that if past flu testing had been as extensive as present Covid-19 testing, we would have seen a lot more people dead of flu, especially old people given that past CDC reports have cataloged those at age 65 and older comprising 50 percent or more of the annual mortality. Based on what we have seen of Covid-19 to date, I would expect, though I don’t have that data handy, that old people comprised most of the deaths in that peak in Omicron mortality in Israel.

Steve-O says: January 31, 2022 at 3:50 pm Dpr, Instead of being busy taking laps and dancing on the graves of the dead, you should look to the data. The problem is, the data doesn’t support your narrative. At this point there’s enough information out there for anyone to find that shows those who become sick and dead are made up disproportionately of the unvaccinated, especially the old and unvaccinated. This is the case in Israel and it is the case here in Alaska. The Israel Health Ministry website breaks down the seriously ill and deaths by under 60 and over 60 and by vaccination status. In the last month, the data shows definitively that the unvaccinated, especially those over 60 make up a disproportionate number of the seriously ill and those who have died. https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general?utm_source=go.gov.il&utm_medium=referral Those who are over 60 and unvaccinated are not just more likely to get covid, but become seriously ill and they are more likely by a factor of 10:1 over the vaccinated. The unvaccinated are also more likely to die at a higher rate than the vaccinated. From the IHM website, in the last 30 days there have been 522 deaths 485 or 93% in those over 60. There were 37 death in those under 60 who, 26 (70%) were unvaccinated in a country that has a 65-67% vaccination rate. Just look at the data per 100,000 it’s amazing what vaccination status tells us about how a group above 60 will respond and how a group below 60 will respond. After reviewing this data I have absolutely no problem saying that vaccines are protecting people, it protects those under 60 from death and it protects people over 60 from becoming seriously ill and dying. If you think what we have now is a “frocking disaster”, just imagine what it would be like if we didn’t have vaccines available! Reply Dread Pirate Roberts says: January 31, 2022 at 4:49 pm Steve o , i know you love to argue so imagine what it would be like without these faulty vaccines- we would have kept our distance from one another and the pandemic would have come to an abrupt end ! But instead people think i have the vacine . Im good to party like aoc , tredeau , ect ect . The vacinated caused the biggest super spreading event. You bring a great point— the old and sick that are unvaccinated die easily. Ask yourself why didn’t they get the vaccine? Were thry to comprimised to get the vaccine? To risky for them ? Immune comprimised ect ? Also you no doubt are calling people without 2-3 boosters unvaccinated. Judt a possibility thought. As to your constant lies such such as me dancing on the dead – you are sick . I do no such thing and have the greatest compassion for those people. Steve – stop lying- stop twisting the facts . You are good at it but its a sick habit. Just stop . I didn’t dance on anyone! What little you are correct on gets lost when 50% of the time you spout twisted lies . Its disfunctional and dishonest steve.

Good job. But you ignored one significant confounder. If you look at vaccination rates in Israel, you might notice the number of unvaccinated climbs steadily (as does the death rate from age 60 through the 90+ group. There’s a reason for this. There are some people in that group too fragile to vaccinate and possibly, as the Norwegians found, so close to the end of life that vaccination would not be worth it: https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1372 Haaretz had a pretty good summary early in the month: “Overall in Israel, according to Health Ministry data, only 14 percent of Israelis over 20 are unvaccinated, yet they account for 45 percent of serious COVID cases. The numbers are even more clear when examining the use of life-saving measures such as ECMO machines and ventilators.” Clearly the vaccines help, but they didn’t help for the 55 percent who got vaccinated and still ended up with serious COVID. What really does seem to help in that regard is being young and fit, but I don’t want to get up on that soapbox again other than to say that years from now I’m confident that someone will do a study showing that if we’d try to get people healthier than this started we would have saved a shit load of lives. Now, for a lot of people, there is little choice but the vax for protection. Anyone who is over 50, fat and out of shape is just being foolish if they don’t get vaccinated. Steve-O says: January 31, 2022 at 7:14 pm Craig, I agree completely that being young and healthy is the way to go, the data is indisputable in this point. The elderly and infirm have been the largest percentage of those affected by this disease since the beginning. If you are young and healthy there is very slim chance of dying from covid. However if you are not young and healthy that does not necessarily hold true. For those of us in between, well I’ve known enough young and healthy people who have lost their sense of smell and taste, who have suffered from debilitating fatigue, who can’t remember shit because they have covid brain, and I’ve known young grossly obese and diabetic people who laughed off covid. Being old and healthy is certainly better than being old and unhealthy, just like being young and healthy is certainly better than being young and unhealthy, I know which one I’d choose given my druthers. Some people will learn from this pandemic, most sadly will not. Being healthy involves doing work like exercise and eating right to stay fit, washing your hands, staying home while sick…time and time again people demonstrate an inability to do these basic things. How many people do you know who still properly wash their hands, or stay home when sick, let alone put forth an effort to eat right or exercise? I am in no way saying the vaccines are the end all be all, but they do offer a very real and very measurable degree of protection especially for those who are unable to undue the ravages of time. I struggle to explain those who are outright denying these facts. Steve-O says: January 31, 2022 at 7:55 pm DPR, I don’t love to argue, I love to be right. When I am proven wrong I accept it and move on, thus becoming right…technically speaking I am never wrong. Whereas I might have been wrong previously, by accepting that fact I am no longer wrong.

A “pregnant man” emoji and “pregnant person” emoji are coming to Apple iPhones with its latest update, iOS 15.4 sparking controversy. Reply Steve-O says: January 26, 2022 at 8:03 pm Many countries around the world do not use the influenza vaccine the way we do here in the US, most in fact don’t. Influenza deaths in the US range between about 12,000 and 52,000 per year for the last decade in the US. In the UK where the influenza vaccine is restricted influenza deaths range between 10,000 and 30,000. The UK has about 20% of the population of the US, multiply the 10,000 to 30,000 number of deaths by 5 and you get 50,000 to 150,000 deaths per year…the influenza death rate in the UK is much higher than the rate in the US. They still use the influenza vaccine, but not as much as we do here. There are similar numbers across Europe, where influenza vaccination rates are much lower than in the US. It’s interesting that with covid we are seeing a death rate of 266/100,000 while in the aftermath of the Spanish Flu influenza death rates were 30-40/100,000 after having reached as high as 590/100,000 during the pandemic. If past is indeed prologue we have a decade or two of covid deaths that will be higher than what we’ve become accustomed to with influenza deaths over the last 30-40 years. As far as masks go, the N-95 should gave been the mask talked about in any mask conversation from day one. The cloth face coverings never offered protection, anyone who has ever had to wear an actual mask and paid attention to the reason why and protection offered by which specific mask chosen would have known that. I wore my N-95’s when I couldn’t control the situation or was in close contact with others, I will wear one when the situation arises still but I rarely need to. A mask is PPE, and PPE stands for Personal Protective Equipment it is designed to protect the person wearing it and must be worn correctly. Reply Bryan says: January 27, 2022 at 2:36 am But can and will you wear an oxygen restricting, Carbon Dioxide inducing N95 FOR 8-10hrs a day, every day? Steve, sorry I couldn’t respond to you on the other thread. Somehow I was restricted from posting. Reply Steve-O says: January 27, 2022 at 6:14 am Bryan, Is that a special kind of N-95? The typical N-95 doesn’t restrict Oxygen or induce carbon dioxide. I’ve worn P and N-100 for hours on end while working and they filter more particles than the N-95, I’ve worn N-95’s for hours on end while working. People do it everyday. The science behind how these masks work is pretty simple, we’ve been over it before, but basically an oxygen or carbon dioxide molecule passes effortlessly through an N-95 mask due to the size of the molecule and the filtering ability of the mask. As I previously said it’s like throwing a baseball through a 250 foot hole, how many baseballs do you think could fit through a 250 foot hole at a time? As long as you aren’t using them underwater an N-95’s does not restrict the flow of oxygen nor do they induce carbon dioxide. I have never been in a situation where I would have to wear a mask 8-10 hours a day, everyday uninterrupted. Bryan says: January 27, 2022 at 10:13 am Interesting thing Steve…Not joking..Was in the hospital and decided to do a little experiment. I had the oxygen meter on my finger and noticed without the mask my oxygen was 99-97. Put the mask over my nose and mouth and it dropped respectively to 96-94. So, around 3 points. That was a cheap cloth mask. Obviously just an observation. Maybe you are right and Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide just sail through. But, if that is the case what good is the mask at stopping the virus which is way smaller? Dread Pirate Roberts says: January 27, 2022 at 10:15 am Masking with cloth masks to k-95 masks and declaring them effective against covid-19 is peddling science fiction. They become ineffective rapidly, they make the moisture particles smaller so tgey become airborne longer . Yes they slow oxygen uptake from out of mask to lungs . They recycle the nasties. They don’t effectively seal around the face and allow easy viral intake. They are inadequate even for large particles. Just a joke against viruses. Use the right tools or keep your distance from people. The claim of those cheap masks is science fiction and our infection rates are higher than ever . Steve o you should stop promoting science fiction. The only thing crappy masks like that are good for is making others feel better. Which I respect and recommend but don’t use them in place of keeping your distance. Sick people using masks still spread disease. Healthy people breathing air from sick people despite masks still catch covid. We played the mask game . It didn’t solve the problem. The facts say they helped very little and may have given people false confidence making the problem worse. Steve-O says: January 27, 2022 at 12:10 pm Bryan, An oxygen molecule has a diameter of about 0.299 nanometers, a carbon dioxide molecule has a diameter of about 0.33 nanometers, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is about 100 nanometers. That means the SARS-CoV-2 virus is about 300 times the size of an oxygen or carbon dioxide molecule, it’s not just a little bigger, it’s a lot bigger. Add to that, as has been well established the virus travels on water droplets. Dread Pirate Roberts says: January 27, 2022 at 12:45 pm Dang it steve 0 , i just dont understand how you cant look at bigger picture. Look up popular mechanics article. It specifically says k-95 masks restrict oxygen 5%-20% which they say is significant for healthy people and worse for cardio compromised people. It’s common sense. Not rocket science. Apparently a solution is being developed. When I work hard with a k-95 mask it puts major stress on my system and still end up sucking bad particles from environment into my airways lungs nose ect. Yes a person at rest or mild activity Will barely notice the difference regarding oxygen. A healthy person that is . We all got that but who wants their oxygen restricted ? Raise your hand . Especially from a marginally effective tool . Imo use efforts that are significantly effective. Not just for virtue signaling. ( im heavily against masks because its one more method of government control that doesn’t solve the problem as is prooved by our on going undampened pandemic that chaotically enjoying itself among naive humans) Bryan says: January 27, 2022 at 12:46 pm Thank’s Steve, I stand corrected. “Various studies report different degrees of protection depending on how they were conducted and how data was collected, but a recent meta-analysis of multiple global studies found that masks are linked to a commanding 53% decrease in COVID-19 transmission when worn properly. An Arizona epidemiologist recently told me how N95 masks or surgical masks have proven to be especially effective. “Several studies have found that surgical masks are between 66% and 70% effective,” she said.” craigmedred – craigmedred.news is committed to Alaska-related news, commentary and entertainment. it is dedicated to the idea that if everyone is thinking alike, someone is not thinking. you can contact the editor directly at craigmedred@gmail.com. craigmedred says: January 27, 2022 at 1:10 pm and exactly how did they measure that, Bryan? link the study. i haven’t read this one, and some of them have been shit. did they put a bunch of people suffering from COVID-19 in an enclosed space for say 18 hours and measure the amount of SARS-CoV-2 in the air afterward?

Influenza death rates in the 1920s, the years that followed the Spanish flu pandemic, ranged from 100/100,000 to 150/100,000 per year – not 30-40/100,000 per year. They did not drop to the level you suggest until the 1940s. These are, of course, flu/pneumonia deaths but the CDC long considered the two so closely linked it historically tracked the data in this way. There has been debate about that – https://aspe.hhs.gov/cdc-influenza-deaths-request-correction-rfc. But it is what is and I’m not going to get into it here. What I am going to say, that if you don’t read the stories; I’m going to block your comments. I rarely do that, almost never in fact though there are plenty of people who write shit with which I strongly disagree personally. I have an extremely liberal view of what constitutes “fair comment.” Intentionally misrepresenting data does not fall within my view of “fair comment.” P.S. U.S. flu/pneumonia deaths average near 60,000 per year. https:/chstats.com/2020/03/09/flu-pneumonia-toll-in-the-u-s-57688-deaths-per-year/ The numbers are about 25,000 per year in the UK. https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutusransparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/20182019and2020ukdeathsduetofluandpneumonia Your math was good on the difference between the U.S. and UK populations. I commend you on that. How you correct this to compare the US and the UK is, however, about more than population numbers. It is also about demographics. UK residents are older, average life span 81.2, than US residents, average lifespan, 78.76; and the UK has a significantly greater number of people over age 75 – 27M for them, 20.6M for us when the numbers are adjusted for population differences. This is a huge confounder. As the CDC notes of influenza/pneumonia, “Death rates increased with age from 31.7 deaths per 100,000 population among adults aged 65–74 years, to 94.2 among adults aged 75–84 years, to 377.6 among those aged ≥85 years. Rates increased with age for both men and women, and in each age group the death rates were higher for men than for women.” https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6940a5.htm As should be obvious there, having a lot of people 75 or older can really up the death rate and if there are a lot 85 or older it can make the death rate explode into Covid-like numbers. Reply Bryan says: January 27, 2022 at 2:48 pm Craig, I am speaking of N-95 masks. Several studies have shown cloth masks provide little protection. Possibly 20%. Not trying to “misinform”. I honestly don’t know because there are so any lies for and against that it is hard to believe anything these days. Especially from something made in China.

It’s a confusing situation. There is a fair it of bad science out there and way too much “modeling.” If the pandemic has taught me anything about modeling, it is this: If you spin data with enough right presumptions and do enough math, you can, by God, “prove” pigs can fly. And of their own volition. Not in the cargo hold of an airplane on the way to the slaughterhouse. All of the studies concluding masks do anything significant are based on modeling or “population” studies, most of which cherry-pick data and ignore confounders. The best study was done before the pandemic in hospitals and concluded medical professionals were largely kidding themselves by thinking masks did much to prevent infections. That said, there are some valid reasons to believe N95s provide some layer of personal protection, and I’ve recommended them to everyone I know who is vulnerable. I’ve also offered those people the added advice that the best protection they can get is 1.) to stay away from other people as much as possible; and 2.) limit their time in closed spaces used by other people as much as possible. 1.) and 2.) are clearly more protective than masks. What N95s do to protect others, who knows. Whatever little that is, I’m pretty confident it could be wiped out in whole or in large part by how people handle the masks. I would note that at this time, a lot of staff from Providence Hospital – where people use PPT regularly and actually know how to use it professionally – are out sick. Israel, which did a superb job of containing SARS-CoV-2 in the first wave of the pandemic, was nicely masked and vaxxed when Omicron hit, and its infection numbers skyrocketed. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/israel/ humans have a really, really bad habit of thinking they can control nature when our abilities to do so remain rather limited. excuse my training in ecology and my long interest in evolution, but it seems increasingly to look like the pandemic is going to be governed more by natural selection than by anything we do. Omicron didn’t take over accidentally, though its first appearance was a biological accident. that’s what mutants are. it was a mutant. it was also a mutant that spread faster and didn’t kill as many of its hosts which made it much easier for it to spread faster. it’s now looking like it could be the new flu of the next generation, and i’m left wondering how under-reported the flu has been in this country through the length of my generation because of its lack of severity. i’ve several times had pretty good go-arounds with the flu, including one bought i thought might kill me. i’ve never reported a single flu infection to anyone. i’d guess most people haven’t. i’d expect that in those years when the flu killed tens of thousands of people, the numbers of flu infections were astronomical. but we didn’t have the data to show that and thus felt a lot safer. now we have the data and its scares the shit out of us, though not everyone acts like it. i say that because there’s one other thing i know. it would really help to reduce infections if people who knew they were sick stayed away from others until they got better. but that isn’t happening. i just read an article by someone who should know better and who shall remain nameless who recounted how he got sick with Omicron and how he decided it was safe to go out,even though he still wasn’t feeling well, because he was wearing a mask. this is magic-bullet thinking and magic bullets are not really. they are the stuff of myths. Dread Pirate Roberts says: January 27, 2022 at 3:46 pm Mr. Medred, I feel for you on the misrepresentation of data ! You put so much thankless effort into it and only get the abstract benefit of getting closer to the truth. Your site is a rare bird of sifting details to get closer to the truth. Rare . It is a site that allows expression regardless of how foolish. It is a site that is a breath of Liberty in a culture that is rapidly turning to authoritarianism or tyranny. Please give Steve o and all of us our chances to make mistakes. Learning is a strangely slow process. I understand the frustration of someone misrepresenting your hard work. Steve O often brings much to a conversation ( despite what I might say😉) please don’t consider banning him. If you must ban someone ban me . I provoked him into errors. Respectfully, DPR Steve-O says: January 27, 2022 at 4:25 pm Craig, My apologies on the numbers there, and I can assure you that I read the story and reread multiple parts. I messed up while editing my comment as I had more written and then deleted sections of it because it was getting to be too many numbers. You are correct that the death rate was much higher than 30-40/100,000 in the decade after the Spanish Flu whereas that 30-40/100,000 number represents during the initial roll out of the influenza vaccine…which was part of my comment that I deleted. The part that real messed me up was where does the 0.56/100,000 come from? When I deleted the parts of my comment I was trying to reconcile all that and the only thing I can figure is that is specifically those deaths that are known and verified to be caused specifically by the flu, which as you’ve pointed out isn’t how these numbers are recorded for better or worse. So I ended up cutting out a large part of that paragraph. I didn’t mean to mislead anyone and will try and make a more concerted effort not to cut out pertinent information next time. Everywhere I’ve read the number is still around 10-15/100,000, even the nchstat site you just posted says it’s 15-22/100,000. The CDC and numerous other sources say 12,000-52,000 deaths per year from influenza, depending upon the year https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html is it any wonder why there’s so much confusion? It’s your site and if you chose to ban me for whatever reason I can’t fault you for that, but it was a simply editing mistake on my part. Once again my apologies. craigmedred – craigmedred.news is committed to Alaska-related news, commentary and entertainment. it is dedicated to the idea that if everyone is thinking alike, someone is not thinking. you can contact the editor directly at craigmedred@gmail.com. craigmedred says: January 27, 2022 at 6:00 pm Steve-O: I don’t want to ban anybody. I want discussions at least generally based on fact. I also sympathize with any confusion anyone has. A lot of the historical data isn’t presented well. A lot of the data isn’t complete. Some of the science isn’t science at all but modeling. The whole damn picture can be confusing as hell. Dread Pirate Roberts says: January 28, 2022 at 7:41 am So true . Especially last paragraph. Variables make data so problematic! A person really has to think objectively without assuming a conclusion. Then doubt their own conclusion for fear of not recognizing a major confounder ! If people gave more credit to confounders our society could be more peaceful! You bring up Great points Craig! Steve-O says: January 28, 2022 at 10:28 am One of the things I always found ‘funny’ about the CDC guidelines for close contacts was that cloth face coverings/masks were never used as a way to guarantee people didn’t get covid. If you were wearing a cloth face covering/mask and had a close contact with someone that had covid the guidelines didn’t differentiate between someone wearing a cloth face covering/mask and someone not wearing a cloth face covering/mask. That should have raised alarm bells to people right there that cloth face coverings/masks were not the be all end all that some had made them out to be. Our former governor was spotted out and about in New York City a couple days after having tested positive for Covid and having had her trial postponed because of her positive test, there’s yet another person who certainly should have known better. Bryan says: January 28, 2022 at 1:06 pm Craig, ran across this from Is Israel. Interesting read on mask technology. I also went and looked at my mask box and on the side it said “NOT FOR MEDICAL USE”. I did see where Israel claims a 90% vaccination rate with skyrocketing infections. I can’t help but wonder are we dealing with mutations or is China releasing different viruses due to the greed and weakness in Washington? Is “Delta” a mutation of the “A” strain like they claimed it was? I don’t think so. Is Omicron a mutation of the “A” strain? I believe it holds different characteristics. We know it isn’t a mutation of the “Delta” strain because you can technically get both Delta and Omicron at the same time and some have. After personally returning from hell I believe these viruses (as I have said here for the last 2yrs) are being purposely released. China is making billions and China is saving billions by weeding out the sick and old. Washington grows rich from Big Pharma and Chinese money. Some in Washington would also like to see the population shrink to “save” the planet. In other words this is an orchestrated bioweapon as scary as that is. Damn scary I say. Follow the money falling out of the Washington elites pockets. https://m.jpost.com/health-science/israeli-mask-co-says-can-protect-wearers-against-delta-variant-673171 Steve-O says: January 28, 2022 at 3:07 pm Bryan, Just out of curiosity, where are you seeing Israel has a 90% vaccination rate? Everywhere I look, including the Israeli Health Ministry, it says it’s around 74% for at least a single dose and 65-67% for fully vaccinated. Bryan says: January 28, 2022 at 3:50 pm Steve-O, this is from Nov 2021. Cannot vouch for the source, but I have seen the 90% number elsewhere. I seem to be only able to post one link. https://www.citizensjournal.us/highly-vaccinated-israel-on-verge-of-an-emergency-as-alleged-covid-cases-spike/ Steve-O says: January 28, 2022 at 8:51 pm Bryan, I wonder if that 90% number is when it was reported that 90% of the eligible adult population was vaccinated. 1/3 of the Israeli population is under age 18. Palestinians make up about 20% of the population in Israel and as a group they are lagging in vaccination rates. This site shows the vaccinations rates in Israel https://ourworldindata.org/vaccination-israel-impact Bryan says: January 29, 2022 at 3:42 am Steve-O, that was kind of my point in all this. I see a 90% and you see a 57 or 70%. One cannot believe anything related to Covid.. There is too much money involved, too much corruption, and too much power and control to be gained over the subjects. There is false narratives to push. The line between dirty, lying cheats and the good guys is blurred. I don’t trust any of them. Especially when they/we know the origins of Covid-19 and are paid by the Chinese to lie about it and they do. Our own government has 2 options, fill their own greedy pockets with Chinese money or go to war with China. Considering China owns and supplies everything to us including masks and Covid tests war is clearly off the table. These same liars are saying we need to secure Ukraines border but ignore our own invasion.

Other viruses doctors are seeingSkip to main content HomeElection 2024Voter GuideNewsArgus911Business JournalSD PoliticsNational PoliticsUSA TODAYBrandon InfoDell Rapids InfoCareers Negative for COVID-19 but still sick? Here's what else is spreading around Sioux FallsAlfonzo Galvan | Sioux Falls Argus LeaderShow Caption Hide Caption COVID-19: Tips to find at-home testsStarting January 19, Americans will be able to have at-home COVID-19 tests shipped to their homes, for free.Staff Video, USA TODAYAmid the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in South Dakota and around the country, more people are calling and visiting their primary care providers, but the diagnosis isn't always the same.Doctors at Avera Health and Sanford Health told the Argus Leader this week that while they're still getting a lot of people visiting for COVID-19, there's other viruses causing people to get sick this time of year that the public should be aware of."There are multiple respiratory viruses that can cause similar upper respiratory and lower respiratory symptoms as COVID," said Jennifer Hsu, an infectious disease doctor at Sanford.What other viruses are causing illnesses in Sioux Falls?Hsu told the Argus Leader the top three most frequent viruses detected by the Sanford Sioux Falls Region Lab outside of COVID-19 were: Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, influenza A and human metapneumovirus.The top three viruses detected by Sanford have very similar symptoms to COVID-19, Hsu said. A runny nose, nasal sinus congestion, sore throat, cough, fever and body aches are all similar symptoms seen in COVID-19 and some of the other viruses going around Sioux Falls.Mark List, a family doctor for Avera, told the Argus Leader he's seen people go to his clinic who test negative for COVID-19 and the flu. Many of his patients just have the common cold or pneumonia. The South Dakota Department of Health doesn't track case numbers for viruses other than COVID-19 and the flu each year, according to its Communication Director, Daniel Bucheli.The latest data from the Department of Health has the flu "widespread" across South Dakota for the week ending Jan. 15. Since the start of the season the state's seen 5,755 cases of the flu.More: South Dakota reports its first influenza death of the 2021-2022 season"As with any other illness, we encourage residents to monitor symptoms and contact their medical providers, if symptoms or length of illness is longer than what they usually experience, for an examination appointment," Bucheli told the Argus Leader via email.List also noted flu season is nearing its peak while RSV season is about to kickoff. RSV cases will start picking up within the next two months, according to List."Even if you're COVID negative, it can still impact your health, right?," List said. "Pneumonia, influenza, those things have been around way before COVID started and can still really impact people's health."When should people go to the doctor?Both List and Hsu agreed that although a person may test negative for COVID-19 they should still check in with their doctors if they're experiencing symptoms, especially shortness of breath."Don't go to work, even if it's COVID negative. Don’t infect your coworkers, keep sick kids at home, keep them out of daycare, if they're having fevers," List said. "If they're having RSV like symptoms, don't expose other people."List also noted Avera is seeing a "short-run" of viral gastroenteritis in Sioux Falls. The viral infection in the GI tract causes nausea and vomiting, according to List.More: Stop visiting the ER for COVID tests, Sanford Health and Avera ask as hospitalizations increaseHow to avoid getting sick?Doctors are seeing families with small children contribute to the spread of viruses. Schools and daycares are common locations for outbreaks of things like RSV and the flu.Hsu told the Argus Leader prevention tactics are the same for any illness. Hand washing is key and wearing a high-quality and fitted face mask."Staying home if we're the ones who are sick so that we're not spreading our respiratory viruses, and then trying to minimize contact with large groups of people," Hsu said.If you get sick, over-the-counter medicines can help alleviate symptoms but should symptoms persist or get serious both List and Hsu recommend people contact their doctors. Is a flu shot still worth it?Flu season peaks in South Dakota around the third week of February each year but that doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't get your flu shot, according to Hsu."Most people have their maximal immune response to the vaccine within about 14 days and so we do see flu seasons that extend well into March and even in some years into April," Hsu said.Flu shots can be administered the same day as COVID shots, according to Hsu.More: Where to find COVID-19 at-home test kits and how to get reimbursed through your insuranceGot a story idea from your community?

Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform together with the Ministry of Health and Social Services on Thursday confirmed the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 strain in wild birds occurring along the coastal line of Walvis Bay and Swakopmund in Erongo region.The HPAI H5N1 is a zoonotic strain and can be transmitted to humans from infected birds, the two ministries said in a joint statement.Over 200 dead wild birds, mainly the Cape Cormorants were observed since Jan. 13 on Bird Island near Walvis Bay and around the Salt Company in Swakopmund.“The source of infection is believed to be the wild migratory birds and the HPAI H5N1 strain is being detected for the first time in the history of Namibia,” they added.The two ministries are jointly conducting disease outbreak investigations and instituted has asked poultry farmers and the general public to immediately report any suspicion of sick or dead domestic or wild birds along the entire Namibian Coastal Line to the nearest State Veterinary Office or other relevant government officials.“Movement of live domestic and wild birds from coastal areas of Erongo region is prohibited in exception of the imports and in-transit consignments originating from other countries,” the statement added.Furthermore, farmers and the general public have been urged to cooperate, support and comply with the control measures put in place to prevent the further spread of the avian influenza infection.To follow Daily News Egypt on WhatsApp press here To follow Daily News Egypt on Telegram press here You

The outbreak of Avian Influenza, also known as bird flu at the coastal towns of Swakopmund and Walvis Bay among aquatic birds have been confirmed over the weekend by the ministry of agriculture. The ministry also sent out a cautionary message to farmers around the country. Coastal residents are cautioned not to touch dead birds in any circumstances while health workers have been tasked to be on high alert not to miss people who might have caught the flu, amidst Covid-19, as symptoms may mimic each other. Agriculture spokesperson, Jona Musheko confirmed the outbreak of the virus to New Era, saying that the ministry has been doing testing and confirmation after several seabirds have been found dead along the coastline for the past weeks. “It was confirmed that it is Avian Influenza type A virus, but we still need to confirm with a second laboratory which strain it is. Either way, we must still take the same precautions,” Musheko said. Avian Influenza refers to the disease caused by infection with bird flu type A virus. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other birds and animal species. It does not normally infect humans, however, sporadic human infections with Avian flu have occurred in the past. Exposure to birds, bird faeces or areas that have been contaminated with bird saliva, mucous or droplets might cause infection. It is also possible to get it by breathing in dust that contains the virus. The directorate of veterinary services (DVS) in the ministry in a statement released over the weekend, indicated that since 13 January, they received reports about dead wild birds specifically Cape cormorants and pelicans on Bird Island and in areas around Salt Company. “ “Live birds were also observed showing clinical signs such as tremors, shivering, staggering movements and swollen heads. Some sick birds showed signs of tameness and reluctance to flee from humans. The source of the infection is suspected to be due to the wild migratory birds,” chief veterinary officer, Albertina Shilongo said in the statement. According to her, domesticated birds (chickens, turkeys, etc.) may become infected through direct contact with infected wild birds, other infected poultry, or through contact with surfaces that have been contaminated with the viruses. “Humans may be infected by flu as some Avian Influenza strains may infect humans. This can occur through the eyes, nose and mouth when handling and coming into close contact with infected poultry/birds, and/or through the handling and consumption of infected products. Further investigations are underway to establish whether the suspected HPAI virus strain can infect humans,” she explained. Meanwhile, the executive director from the health ministry, Ben Nangombe yesterday said there won’t be any immediate threat if the current Covid-19 measures are followed. “I think we are fortunate that we are fighting the Covid-19 virus currently and since it’s a flu and spread by way of droplets and so forth, let us continue wearing our masks and follow all precautionary measures set out by the agriculture ministry and the health ministry,” he said.
