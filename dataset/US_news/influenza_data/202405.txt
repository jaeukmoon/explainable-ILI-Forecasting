CDC Update January 31, 2024 – A new CDC co-authored study published in Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses describes findings from avian influenza A(H5) virus surveillance in live bird markets (LBMs) across Vietnam over a nearly six-year period (March 2017- September 2022). The study found almost 40% of samples taken from LBMs in Vietnam were positive for influenza A viruses with the prevalence of H5 bird flu increasing in 2022. Active surveillance (regular testing) was better at detection than passive surveillance (receiving reports), especially when poultry did not show signs of illness. This study underscores how LBM surveillance remains a vitally important activity for situational awareness around bird flu, bird flu mitigation, and pandemic preparedness activities. LBMs, where large numbers of live birds are bought or traded, are commonplace in many parts of the world, including Vietnam. LBMs are settings where many different avian influenza viruses can be found, and this raises the risk for human infections or new avian influenza viruses emerging through genetic reassortment (mixing of virus genes). For this study, two methods were used to capture the percent positivity and geographic distribution of avian influenza A(H5) detections: Passive surveillance of influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N6), and A(H5N8) where outbreaks were reported to the Vietnamese Department of Animal Health. Active surveillance of influenza A, A(H5), A(H5N1), A(H5N6), and A(H5N8) viruses where 30 poultry oropharyngeal swab specimens and five environmental samples were collected monthly at each LBM. From March 2017 to September 2022, 128,870 specimens were collected at 167 LBMs in 24 provinces. Almost 40% of pooled samples (samples pooled into groups of five) were positive for influenza A. Influenza A(H5) virus was detected in LBMs at least once in more than 90% of provinces and more than half of LBMs sampled in Vietnam. The prevalence of A(H5) in LBMs also increased during 2022 to 6%. During the same time period, there were 246 A(H5) outbreaks in poultry; most outbreaks were of influenza A(H5N6) followed by A(H5N1) and A(H5N8). Active surveillance captured more influenza A(H5) virus activity than what was passively reported through outbreaks. In addition to finding year-round circulation of A(H5) virus in poultry and LBM environmental samples in Vietnam, the study authors also found differences in geographic and annual temporal patterns of avian influenza: Influenza A(H5N1) and A(H5N6) viruses circulated across all sampled regions. Higher A(H5N1) positivity rates were observed in LBMs in the Southern region Higher A(H5N6) positivity rates were observed in LBMs in the Central region Influenza A(H5N8) virus was only detected in LBMs in the Northern and Southern areas. Influenza A(H5) positivity rate was higher in LBMs in the Southern provinces. (This may reflect the higher number of domestic ducks living in these areas.) These study findings further support the value of partnerships to enhance global influenza surveillance. The first collaboration between Vietnam's National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) and CDC began in 1999 with sero-epidemiology studies of H5 and H9 among poultry workers in LBMs in Hanoi, and this work built capacity at NIHE which was critical in the response to the SARS outbreak of 2003. From 2003 to 2022, 127 infections and 64 deaths with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5) viruses have been detected in people living in Vietnam. Since 2013, avian influenza surveillance has been conducted in provinces in Vietnam with active LBMs through a collaboration between the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Department of Animal Health (DAH), and CDC. The current risk to the U.S. public from HPAI A(H5) viruses in Vietnam remains low. However, because of the potential for influenza viruses to rapidly evolve and the wide global prevalence of HPAI A(H5) viruses in wild birds and poultry outbreaks, continued sporadic human infections are anticipated. Continued comprehensive surveillance of these viruses in LBMs and frequent risk assessments, are critical to a continuous public health risk assessment, along with ongoing preparedness efforts. Global influenza surveillance, both epidemiologic and virologic, is the foundation of influenza preparedness and response for influenza, including avian influenza.

Therefore, it is important to search for host antiviral proteins and elucidate their antiviral mechanisms for the development of potential treatments. As a part of human innate immunity, host restriction factors can inhibit the replication of viruses, among which SAM and HD domain containing deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase 1 (SAMHD1) can restrict the replication of viruses, such as HIV and enterovirus EV71. Viruses also developed countermeasures in the arms race with their hosts. There are few reports about whether SAMHD1 has a restriction effect on IAV.MethodsTo investigate the impact of IAV infection on SAMHD1 expression in A549 cells, we infected A549 cells with a varying multiplicity of infection (MOI) of IAV and collected cell samples at different time points for WB and RT-qPCR analysis to detect viral protein and SAMHD1 levels. The virus replication level in the cell culture supernatant was determined using TCID50 assay. Luciferase assay was used to reveal that H5N1 virus polymerase acidic protein (PA) affected the activity of the SAMHD1 promoter. To assess the antiviral capacity of SAMHD1, we generated a knockdown and overexpressed cell line for detecting H5N1 replication.ResultsIn this study, we observed that SAMHD1 can restrict the intracellular replication of H5N1 and that the H5N1 viral protein PA can downregulate the expression of SAMHD1 by affecting SAMHD1 transcriptional promoter activity. We also found that SAMHD1's ability to restrict H5N1 is related to phosphorylation at 592-tyrosine.ConclusionsIn conclusion, we found that SAMHD1 may affect the replication of IAVs as a host restriction factor and be countered by PA. Furthermore, SAMHD1 may be a potential target for developing antiviral drugs. BackgroundInfluenza viruses are divided into four subtypes: A, B, C and D. Influenza virus subtypes A, B, and C are capable of infecting humans, and the virus causing many times pandemics is IAV. It has caused many major pandemics, such as the 1918 “Spanish influenza” (H1N1) [1], 1957 “Asian influenza” (H2N2) [2,3,4], 1968 “Hong Kong influenza” (H3N2) [5, 6] and 2009 H1N1 influenza [7]. Together, it killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide [8, 9]. Currently, IAV still causes 10% of human infections and approximately half a million deaths each year [10].Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the main viral proteins that cause antigenic responses on the virus surface [11]. IAV is subtyped according to the antigenicity of the surface glycoproteins into 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes. It can form a variety of subtypes through antigenic drift and antigenic shift, among which H1N1 and H3N2 are circulating in the population, causing widespread transmission. Other viruses such as H5N1, H5N6, H6N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N7, H7N9, H9N2, H10N7, and H10N8 pose a potential risk to humans [12]. To date, all IAVs that cause pandemics are produced by genetic reassortment [13,14,15]. Among avian influenza virus (AIVs), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has the most serious impact on human health [16]. In 1997, H5N1 virus was first reported in Hong Kong, China, and caused acute pneumonia and death [17, 18]. In 2003, H5N1 reemerged in Asia, and by 2019, 861 patients had been diagnosed, of whom 455 patients had died [19]. In 2020, virus 2.3.4.4b, a branch of HPAI H5N1, was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). The virus originated from the previously circulating H5Nx virus and was a recombination of the H5N8 with the H1N1 and H3N8 subtypes of AIV [20]. This virus has resulted in many deaths in wild birds and poultry, which means that virus 2.3.4.4b is now widespread in the wild [21]. This indicates that H5N1 still poses a potential pandemic risk to animals and humans.After IAV enters cells, host cells recognize the virus through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which induce the secretion of cytokines such as type I interferon (IFN-I). IFN-I binds to IFN receptors to activate downstream signaling pathways. It leads to the transcription of hundreds of interferon stimulator genes (ISGs), which puts cells into an “antiviral state” and suppresses the replication and spread of viruses [22]. In contrast, IAV have also evolved several strategies to hinder IFN expression, thus successfully proliferating in cells [23]. During IAV replication in cells, nonstructural protein 1(NS1) and PA can inhibit the IFN signaling pathway, thus bypassing the antiviral activity of the host immune system, which is critical for IAV infection [24,25,26,27]. PA participates in the life cycle of IAV and is closely related to virulence. Its amino acid mutation can affect the virulence and pathogenicity of the virus [28]. Some cellular proteins can interact with PA and are required for viral replication, such as C14orf166 (chromosome 14 open reading frame 166, CLE) [29] and minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex [30]. However, some host proteins interacting with PA proteins to restrict virus replication have also been identified, such as HCLS1-associated protein X-1(HAX1) [31].Many host restriction factors can limit the replication of viruses, and some host restriction factors also belong to ISGs, such as ISG15 [32]. The expression of SAMHD1 in cells is also upregulated by IFN [33]. miR-181a, miR-155 and miR-30a downregulate SAMHD1 expression by binding to the 3’UTR [33, 34]. In contrast, SAMHD1 participates in the IFN pathway as a negative regulator [35]. SAMHD1 plays a key role in regulating the cell cycle, innate immune responses, and DNA damage repair. Mutation of the human SAMHD1 protein is associated with the autoimmune disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). When SAMHD1 has a loss-of-function mutation, the patient's main clinical symptom is increased production of IFN-I throughout the whole body [36]. SAMHD1 was identified as an inhibitor of HIV-1 in 2011 [37,38,39]. It is a 72 kDa protein that can be divided into four functional regions, namely, the nuclear localization sequence (NLS), the SAM region associated with tetramer formation, the HD region associated with enzyme activity, and the VPX binding region [40, 41]. SAMHD1 inhibits early-phase HIV-1 replication in dendritic and other myeloid cells by preventing viral cDNA synthesis via its negative regulatory effect on intercellular dNTP pools [42, 43]. Meanwhile, some reports suggest that the nuclease activity of SAMHD1 contributes to its antiviral activity by directly degrading HIV-1 RNA [44,45,46]. Furthermore, SAMHD1 has also been reported to regulate HIV-1 latency by suppressing HIV-1 long terminal repeats (LTR) activity [47]. In addition, there is growing evidence that SAMHD1 inhibits various viruses, including retroviruses and DNA viruses, by depleting the dNTP pool in cells [45, 48,49,50,51,52], making it insufficient to support viral DNA synthesis [53,54,55,56].Our previous studies have shown that SAMHD1 effectively inhibits the replication of RNA viruses such as Enterovirus 71 (EV71), while TRIM21, an E3 ligase, and IFN inducer, interacts specifically with and degrades SAMHD1 via the proteasome pathway [57]. Although SAMHD1 has a restriction effect on HIV and EV71, its restriction effect on IAV has not been reported, and whether IAV can overcome SAMHD1's antiviral effect to infect cells remains to be investigated. In this study, we describe the restriction effect of SAMHD1 on H5N1 and the mechanism by which H5N1 downregulates SAMHD1 via PA. These findings extend the study of the antiviral mechanism of SAMHD1 and contribute to the development of new antiviral strategies.Materials and methodsPlasmid constructionPLKO.1-shSAMHD1 was kindly provided by Professor Wenyan Zhang (Jilin University) [57]. SAMHD1 followed by a his/myc tag was inserted into BamHI/XhoI of pCDNA3.1. Whole mRNAs including cells mRNA and viral mRNA were extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse transcripted (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Interferon regulatory Factor 3(IRF3) and viral PA followed by a flag tag were amplified from viral mRNAs and inserted into BamHI/XhoI of pCDNA3.1. Mutations of SAMHD1-mychis were constructed on SAMHD1-mychis with primers listed in Table 1.Table 1 Primers used in this studyFull size tableStable silenced and overexpressed cell linesFor stable silenced cell lines, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with sh-SAMHD1-PLKO.1 or PLKO.1 plus RRE, REV, and VSV-G expression vectors by using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). For stable overexpressed cell lines, 293T cells were cotransfected with SAMHD1-PLVX or PLVX plus RRE, REV, and VSV-G expression vectors by using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). At 48 h after transfection, supernatants containing packaged lentivirus were harvested and used to infect A549 cells for 48 h. Puromycin (1.5 μg/ml for A549, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was then added to the culture to screen for stable cell lines.Cell culture and virusesHuman lung alveolar epithelial cells A549, HEK293T cells and MDCK cells were cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 1% penicillin‒streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Influenza virus A/environment/Qinghai/1/2008(H5N1) and H1N1 virus A/Beijing/05/2009 were grown in 8-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and titrated on MDCK cells.Transfection and infectionDNA transfections were conducted by Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For viral infection, briefly, A549 cells and 293T cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in a 12-well plate, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with IAVs at 37 °C for 1 h at the described MOI. The DMEM supplemented for virus infection contained 2% FBS and 2.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). During adsorption, the plate was gently agitated at 20-min intervals. Following adsorption, the virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 2% FCS, followed by incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for the indicated time points.TCID50First, 1.5 × 104 MDCK cells were seeded in a 96-well plate one day before infection. Twenty-four hours later, the virus was diluted to different dilutions with fresh serum-free DMEM containing 2.5% BSA. Then, MDCK cells were infected with the diluted virus for 1 h and gently agitated at 20-min intervals. Before and after infection, the inoculum was removed and washed once with PBS. The positive cytopathic effects correlating with the amount of virus were documented and used for calculating the virus titer according to Reed and Muench’s method. Each experimental condition was tested in triplicate.Immunoblotting (IB) and antibodiesTransfected or infected cells were harvested and boiled in 1X loading buffer (0.08 M Tris, pH 6.8, with 2.0% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 M dithiothreitol and 0.2% bromophenol blue) followed by separation on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane for Western blot analysis (Pall, catalog no. 66458). The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, followed by a corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA, USA) diluted 1:10,000. Proteins incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody were visualized using the ultra-sensitive ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Meilunbio, catalog no. MA0186).RNA extraction and RT‒qPCRTotal cell RNA was extracted from infected A549 or 293T cells with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Two micrograms of RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA using the GoScript™ Reverse Transcriptase System (Promega, A5004). RT‒qPCR was performed on an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) with the UltraSYBR Mixture (Cwbio, CW2601M) in a total volume of 20 μl per sample, containing 10 μl of 2 × mix, 1 μl of 5 μmol/L of each primer and 2 µg of cDNA template. The primers used in RT‒qPCR is presented in Table 1.Luciferase reporter assayHEK293T cells were plated in 12-well culture plates at 70–80% confluence and transfected with the indicated plasmids along with 0.02 µg pRL-TK as an internal reference control by Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and subjected to a luciferase assay.Statistical analysisThe detailed statistical analysis is described in the figure legends. All data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical comparisons between the two groups were made using Student’s t-test. Significant differences are indicated in the figures as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001. p values of less than 0.05 are considered to represent a statistically significant difference, ns stands for no significance.ResultsSAMHD1 expression was downregulated by H5N1 virus infectionIAV, like other viruses, needs to overcome host immunity to replicate in cells. It can hinder interferon production in a variety of ways. To investigate the interaction between IAV and SAMHD1, we infected A549 cells with H5N1 at a MOI of 0.5 and 1.5. The cells and culture supernatants were collected at different time points. The protein and RNA levels of the viral protein nucleoprotein (NP) increased significantly with time (Fig. 1A, B, D). The H5N1 titer of the cell culture supernatant also increased with time (Fig. 1C). The protein level of SAMHD1 increased slightly at 24 and 12 h after infection and then decreased (Fig. 1A, B). The RNA level of SAMHD1 in A549 cells also showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing after virus infection (Fig. 1E). Similar to the SAMHD1 protein level shown in the WB results, the decrease in SAMHD1 RNA was more significant at an MOI of 1.5 than at an MOI of 0.5 (Fig. 1E). In conclusion, the results suggest that H5N1 may downregulate SAMHD1 expression by affecting transcription stage. In addition to A549 cells, we also infected 293T cells with H5N1 and monitored the viral replication status and the amount of SAMHD1 at various time points. The results showed that the findings in 293T cells were similar to those in A549 (Fig. 2). However, although SAMHD1 in 293T cells was upregulated and then decreased after infection, the change was less significant than that in A549 cells (Fig. 2E).Fig. 1Changes in SAMHD1 protein levels and RNA levels in A549 cells infected with H5N1. A549 cells were infected with H5N1 at MOIs of 0.5 (A) and 1.5 (B), respectively. The cells and culture supernatants were harvested at the indicated time points. Immunoblotting (IB) analysis of H5N1 NP, M2, and SAMHD1 in cells was performed, with GAPDH as a loading control (A, B). The expression levels of SAMHD1 protein were quantified with ImageJ software to calculate the values relative to that for GAPDH. The infectious viral loads in the cell supernatants were determined by TCID50 analysis using 96-well plates (C). H5N1 NP (D) and SAMHD1 (E) RNA levels in cell lysates were detected by RT‒qPCR and normalized to GAPDH, and the RNA level in A549 cells at 0 h post infection was set as 1. Data are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. The results are representative of those from three independent repeats (mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, paired t test)Full size imageFig. 2Changes in SAMHD1 protein levels and RNA levels in 293T cells infected with H5N1. 293T cells were infected with H5N1 at MOIs of 0.5 (A) and 1.0 (B). The cells and culture supernatants were harvested at the indicated time points. Immunoblotting (IB) analysis of H5N1 NP and SAMHD1 in cells was performed, with GAPDH as a loading control (A, B). The expression levels of SAMHD1 protein were quantified as described before. The infectious viral loads in the cell supernatants were determined by TCID50 analysis using 96-well plates (C). H5N1 NP (D) and SAMHD1 (E) RNA levels in cell lysates were detected by RT‒qPCR and normalized to GAPDH, and the RNA level in A549 cells at 0 h post infection was set as 1. Data are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. The results are representative of those from three independent repeats (mean ± SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, paired t test)Full size imageThe downregulation of SAMHD1 expression was correlated with the MOI of H5N1To further confirm the above results and demonstrate the effects of different H5N1 MOIs on A549 cells, we infected A549 cells with H5N1 at MOIs of 0.2, 1.0, and 1.5 and analyzed the expression of SAMHD1 and NP at 48 h post-infection. We observed that the viral protein NP increased with the infection titer (Fig. 3A, C). The expression of SAMHD1 protein was significantly downregulated with increasing infection dose (Fig. 3A), suggesting that H5N1 virus infection can downregulate SAMHD1 expression in A549 cells, and as the infection titer increases, the amount of SAMHD1 protein in the cells decreases. However, after infecting cells with H5N1 at MOIs of 1.0 and 1.5, the amount of SAMHD1 mRNA did not decrease as significantly as the protein level (Fig. 3A, B), and the RNA levels of SAMHD1 in samples infected with H5N1 at MOIs of 1.0 and 1.5 were still higher than those uninfected after 48 h of infection (Fig. 3B), consistent with the results at the 48-h time point in Fig. 1E. This could be due to the protein expression of SAMHD1 being subject to posttranscriptional regulation. The results showed that H5N1 downregulates SAMHD1 at the protein and mRNA levels. Its downregulation ability was positively related to the MOI of the infected virus.Fig. 3Effect of H5N1 infection dose on SAMHD1 protein levels and RNA levels in A549 cells. A549 cells were infected with H5N1 at an MOI of 0.2, 1.0, or 1.5 (A). The cells were harvested at 48 h post infection. Immunoblotting (IB) analysis of H5N1 NP and SAMHD1 in cells was performed, with GAPDH as a loading control (A). The expression levels of SAMHD1 protein were quantified as described before. H5N1 NP (B) and SAMHD1 (C) RNA levels in cell lysates were detected by RT‒qPCR and normalized to GAPDH, and the RNA level in A549 cells at 0 h post infection was set as 1. Data are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. The results are representative of those from three independent repeats (mean ± SD, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, paired t test)Full size imageSAMHD1 expression was downregulated by H1N1 virus infectionThrough the above results, we found that H5N1 can down-regulate SAMHD1 expression and is correlated with the amount of virus. To see if other IAV have similar capabilities, we conducted a similar experiment with H1N1. we infected A549 cells with H1N1 at several MOIs and analyzed the expression of SAMHD1 (Fig. 4). At the same time, since the phosphorylation of SAMHD1 may affect its antiviral ability[58, 59], we also examined the effect of influenza virus infection on SAMHD1 phosphorylation (Figs. 4, 5). By examining the changes of SAMHD1 after H5N1 and H1N1 different MOI infection, we found that the down-regulation effect of IAV on SAMHD1 is broad spectrum. Both H5N1 and H1N1 can downregulate SAMHD1 expression. Phosphorylation levels were not significantly associated with IAV infection Fig 4 (A, B, D) , (Fig. 5A). The ability of H5N1 to down-regulate SAMHD1 appears to be more significant than H1N1. This may be related to the pathogenicity of the virus. We take H5N1 as the main research content in next study.Fig. 4Changes in SAMHD1 protein and RNA levels in A549 cells infected with H1N1. A549 cells were infected with H1N1 at MOIs of 0.5 (A) and 1.5 (B), respectively. The cells were harvested at the indicated time points.

To verify this conjecture, we first used inhibitors to check whether the H5N1 virus could degrade SAMHD1 at the protein level. Proteasome and lysosome pathways are the two main methods of protein degradation in cells. Since both the protein and mRNA of SAMHD1 may be downregulated by H5N1, we first treated A549 cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132, lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ), or 3-methyladenine (3-MA) to elucidate whether H5N1 downregulates SAMHD1 expression through the above protein degradation pathways. The inhibitors were added to infected or uninfected A549 cells, and SAMHD1 and NP protein levels were detected 24 h after infection. The results showed that H5N1 did not downregulate SAMHD1 expression through the above protein degradation pathway (Fig. 6A, B). The protein level of SAMHD1 can be regulated not only at the translation stage but also by promoter activity at the transcriptional stage. The viral protein PA has been reported to inhibit the activation of IRF3 [60], and IRF3 is one of the factors that regulate the activity of the SAMHD1 transcriptional promoter [61]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the viral protein PA can regulate the expression of SAMHD1 by affecting the activity of IRF3. For this purpose, SAMHD1 promoter luciferase activity was assessed in 293T cells transfected with SAMHD1-Luc, IRF3 and PA plasmids. The luciferase activity in cells was detected 24 h later. The results showed that transfection of PA protein significantly downregulated the promoter activity of SAMHD1 (Fig. 6C), which means that H5N1 protein PA affects the expression level of SAMHD1 protein by regulating its transcription process.Fig. 6Mechanism of H5N1 downregulation of SAMHD1 protein and RNA levels. A549 cells were infected with H5N1 at an MOI of 1.0 (A, B). A549 cells were treated with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 10 μM MG132, 50 μM CQ and 160 μM 3-MA for 12 h prior to harvest. and subjected to IB at 48 h post infection (A) or at the indicated time points (B) with GAPDH as a loading control.

To verify the hypothesis that SAMHD1 can restrict against H5N1 replication, SAMHD1 overexpression and knockdown A549 cell lines were constructed in this study and were infected with H5N1 at 0.3 MOI. Viral protein NP and SAMHD1 expression levels were detected at different time points. We observed that viral protein NP in SAMHD1 knockdown cells was significantly higher than that in control cells (Fig. 7A). The mRNA level of NP protein exhibited similarity to that of the protein and was significantly enhanced in SAMHD1 knockdown cells compared to control cells (Fig. 7B). By detecting the virus titer in the cell culture supernatant, we found that the virus titer in the supernatant of cells with SAMHD1 knocked down was significantly higher than that of control cells (Fig. 7C). Unlike SAMHD1 knocked down cells, in overexpressing SAMHD1 cell lines, viral protein NP and M2 is lower than that in control cells (Fig. 8A). The level of virus mRNA and the amount of virus in the culture supernatant in the overexpressing SAMHD1 cell lines were significantly reduced compared to the control cells (Fig. 8B, C), which indicated that H5N1 replication can be significantly inhibited by SAMHD1. The results show that SAMHD1 can inhibit the replication of H5N1 and may be a restriction factor of H5N1.Fig. 7H5N1 replication was enhanced in SAMHD1 knockdown cells. Stable A549 cell lines generated by transfecting control vector (PLKO.1) and sh-SAMHD1 constructs were infected with H5N1 at an MOI of 0.3 (A). The cells and culture supernatants were harvested at the indicated time points. Immunoblotting analysis of NP, M2 and SAMHD1-Flag in cells was performed with GAPDH as a loading control. Viral RNA in cell lysates was detected by RT‒qPCR and normalized to GAPDH, and the viral RNA level in A549 cells at 0 h post infection was set as 1 (B). Viral titers of H5N1 in the supernatants were measured by the cytopathic effect method (C). The results are representative of those from three independent repeats (mean ± SD, ns stands for no significance, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, paired t test)Full size imageFig. 8H5N1 replication was weakened in SAMHD1 overexpressed cells.

Immunoblotting analysis of NP, M2 and SAMHD1 in cells was performed with GAPDH as a loading control. Viral RNA in cell lysates was detected by RT‒qPCR and normalized to GAPDH, and the viral RNA level in A549 cells at 0 h post infection was set as 1 (B).

The results are representative of those from three independent repeats (mean ± SD, ns stands for no significance, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, paired t test).Full size imageSAMHD1 restriction was associated with phosphorylation at threonine 592SAMHD1 is a host restriction factor, and its function in restricting other reported viruses is related to phosphorylation at threonine 592 (T592). In HIV, the antiviral activity of SAMHD1 is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at the T592 residue [58]. For EV71, SAMHD1 phosphorylated at T592 loses the ability to restrict EV71 replication, which is similar to the restriction in HIV [59]. To investigate whether the anti-H5N1 capability of SAMHD1 is associated with the phosphorylation of tyrosine at position 592, we engineered A549 cells to stably express dephosphorylation mutants of SAMHD1 (T592A) and phosphomimetic mutants of SAMHD1 (T592D). Following this, we infected these cells with H5N1 and collected cell samples at various time points to assess virus replication (Fig. 9). To achieve a significant viral suppression effect, the infection MOI was set to 0.1. The results showed that dephosphorylation mutant T592A SAMHD1-expressing cells had stronger inhibition of H5N1 than the wild type, while the phosphorylated mutant T592D had weaker inhibition of H5N1 (Fig. 9). This means that SAMHD1's ability to inhibit H5N1 is related to phosphorylation at T592, which negatively regulates H5N1, similar to HIV-1 and EV71, which suggests that SAMHD1 may have the same mechanism to suppress the above three viruses.Fig. 9SAMHD1 restriction of H5N1 replication was associated with phosphorylation at T592. Stable A549 cell lines generated by transfecting PLVX-SAMHD1-FLAG, PLVX-SAMHD1-T592A-FLAG or PLVX-SAMHD1-T592D-FLAG plasmids were infected with H5N1 at an MOI of 0.1, and the cells were harvested at the indicated time points. Immunoblotting analysis of NP and SAMHD1-Flag in cells was performed with GAPDH as a loading controlFull size imageConclusion and discussionThe viral protein HA first binds to sialic acid (SA) on the surface of the respiratory epithelial cell membrane. AIVs prefer to bind to the SA linked to galactose in the form of alpha-2,3, while human IAVs (H1, H2, H3) prefer to bind to SA linked to galactose in the form of alpha-2,6 [62]. After IAV enters the susceptible cell, the conformation of the virus M2 protein changes, the cation channel opens, and the pH in the virus particle decreases, causing the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNP) to detach from M1 matrix protein (M1) and release into the cytoplasm [63, 64]. In vRNP, nucleoprotein (NP) binds to viral RNA, and the viral RNA polymerase complex binds to the end of viral RNA. Proteins in the vRNP complex are localized to the nucleus through Importinα and Importinβ mediated classical nuclear input pathways for replication and transcription [65, 66]. Viral mRNA is then exported to the cytoplasm, along with the expression of viral proteins. M1 proteins can bind to vRNA and NP proteins, facilitating the assembly of vRNP complexes [67]. The NS2 protein can form a chain structure with the M1 and vRNP complex to guide vRNP out of the nucleus. The exported vRNP complex will first accumulate in the microtubule tissue center of the cytoplasm and be transported to the plasma membrane through the circulating endosome. With the help of HA, NA, M2 and other proteins, infectious virions will be formed on the membrane and released out of the cell through budding [68].Many host restrictions have shown anti-influenza functions in several ways, such as virus entry (IFITM2, IFITM3) [69], genomic replication (OAS/RNaseL) [70], protein translation (PKR) [71, 72] and virus egress (BST-2) [73]. Our group has previously found that TIP60 can inhibit IAV replication through the TBK1-IRF3 pathway [74]. In this study, we found that SAMHD1 can restrict the replication of H5N1 and that H5N1 can downregulate the expression of SAMHD1, thus antagonizing the antiviral effect of host cells. First, we detected that the expression level of SAMHD1 increased slightly and then decreased in A549 cells infected with H5N1 and H1N1 Fig. 1 (A, B), Fig. 4, Fig. 5 , suggesting that SAMHD1 may be involved in the antiviral mechanism of host cells, and its downregulation may be due to the influence of IAVs infection. We then determined that SAMHD1 inhibits H5N1 replication and is a host restriction factor for IAV H5N1 by using SAMHD1 knockdown and overexpressed A549 cell lines (Figs. 7A, 8A). In these results, we also found an inconsistency between the protein level and mRNA level of SAMHD1. After H5N1 infection, the protein and mRNA levels of SAMDH1 first increased and then decreased. However, at 48 h, the protein level was significantly lower than that at 0 h, while the mRNA level at 48 h was not, which is inconsistent with the WB results. This may be because the expression level of SAMD1 protein is not only related to the mRNA level but also subject to posttranscriptional regulation, such as through the UTR. In 293T cells, the intracellular SMHD1 mRNA level at 48 h was significantly lower than that in uninfected cells. The reason for the different changes in SAMHD1 in the two types of cells is not clear, and it may be due to SAMHD in 293T cells mainly regulating the amount of SAMHD1 protein through changes in mRNA levels. Thus far, we have established the antiviral function of SAMHD1, but its specific antiviral mechanism is not clear. SAMHD1 may exert antiviral function directly or through the downstream pathway of SAMHD1, which may be one of the next research directions.Since PA protein can bind to IRF3 to inhibit its activity and IRF3 can upregulate SAMHD1 expression by increasing SAMHD1 promoter activity, we hypothesize that H5N1 virus PA protein downregulates SAMHD1 expression through a similar mechanism. This was demonstrated by the results that PA can downregulate the SAMHD1 transcription levels by downregulating IRF3 activity (Fig. 6C). SAMHD1 is phosphorylated at T592 by CDK/cyclin D/E in the G1-like phase [75]. We previously found that the T592D mutant, the SAMHD1 phosphorylation mimic, lost its EV71 restriction activity [57]. Therefore, we examined the effect of SAMHD1 phosphorylation at T592 on its antiviral ability and found that the ability of SAMHD1 to restrict IAV H5N1 is negatively regulated by T592 phosphorylation (Fig. 10), which may be one of the sites that regulate the antiviral ability of SAMHD1. SAMHD1 can inhibit the IFN-I pathway [35] and may play a role when IFN-I expression is too high. Therefore, the downregulation of SAMHD1 expression by PA can not only counter the antiviral effect of SAMHD1 but also affect the downregulation of IFN-I by SAMHD1 and its downstream pathway, which is believed to play an antiviral function and is produced after virus infection. To explore treatment against IAV, the strategy by which IAV regulates IFN deserves further study.Fig. 10Proposed inhibition mechanism of host SAMHD1 on H5N1 replication. PA dephosphorylates IRF3, resulting in decreased expression of SAMHD1, which is resistant to the antiviral effect of SAMHD1. The antiviral effect of SAMHD1 was negatively correlated with its phosphorylation. PA had no significant effect on the phosphorylation of SAMHD1Full size imageIn conclusion, following viral infection, the virion constituents, particularly viral nucleic acids, are sensed by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). These receptors use adaptor proteins to stimulate a signal transduction pathway that sequentially triggers the next molecule downstream in the pathway ultimately culminating in the phosphorylation activation of IRF3 and the expression of IFN and SAMHD1 genes. The PA protein will be able to dephosphorylate IRF3, thereby inactivating it and thus downregulating the subsequent expression of SAMHD1 (Fig. 10).

The cases are the first of 2024 and raise the country's number of cases since early 2023 to eight. Though officials haven't announced genetic sequencing results on the viruses that infected the two new patients, the rash of earlier cases was caused by clade 2.3.2.1c, an older H5N1 strain that has circulated in the region for more than a decade. The clade is different from the 2.3.4.4b clade that is currently circulating widely in wild birds and poultry, with sporadic detections in mammals and people. Cambodia reported its last human H5N1 cases—one of them fatal—in October. Of the 6 cases reported from Cambodia in 2023, 4 patient died and 2 survived after mild illnesses, according to background information from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Patients from different regions The ministry announced the first case on January 26 in a statement, which was translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary (AFD), an infectious disease news blog. The patient is a 3-year-old boy from Prey Veng province in the country's southeast who is currently hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU). Investigators found that, 10 days earlier, dead chickens were reported around the boy's home. Yesterday, the ministry announced a second case, which involves a 69-year-old man from Siem Reap province in the northwest who is also hospitalized and was admitted to the ICU, according to another official statement translated and posted by AFD. The ministry said the man raises 50 to 60 chickens at his home and that poultry deaths have been occurring over the past 2 weeks.

The study looked at people’s immune response to various flu vaccines to determine which vaccines induced the best antibody response to circulating influenza viruses. The findings of this study have potential implications for flu vaccination strategy and are part of an ongoing effort to develop better flu vaccines. For more than 70 years, most influenza (flu) vaccines have been produced by growing influenza viruses in chicken eggs. One drawback of this production method is that it often introduces changes to the viruses as they adapt to grow in eggs. These so-called “egg-adapted changes” can render the vaccine viruses significantly different from circulating “wild” flu viruses. As a result, egg-based vaccines can prompt a person’s immune system to direct antibodies at targets, or “epitopes,” on the vaccine viruses that are not found on circulating viruses. This could result in reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE). Research has shown this antibody response could be reinforced by repeated egg-based vaccination, which could contribute to further reductions in VE over time. Two non-egg-based flu vaccines—the recombinant flu vaccine and the cell culture-based flu vaccine—were introduced in the United States during the 2013-14 flu season. The study, which looked at data from a randomized clinical trial conducted during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2021 influenza seasons, compared antibody responses following vaccination with recombinant, cell culture-based, or standard egg-based influenza vaccines among 1,400 people. The results indicate that vaccination with recombinant influenza vaccine induced the most robust antibody responses against multiple vaccine viruses. They also indicate that repeated vaccination with non-egg-based flu vaccines could overcome the effect of prior repeated vaccination with egg-based vaccines. Redirecting the antibody responses away from egg-adapted epitopes resulted in higher antibody responses to cell-grown viruses that better represent circulating viruses. The findings could inform decision-making related to optimal vaccination strategies for people in different age groups and populations. For one, vaccination with non-egg-based flu vaccines could be especially beneficial for people who have been repeatedly vaccinated with egg-based vaccines. This could include health care personnel who have annual vaccination requirements and older adults, who tend to have been vaccinated more frequently than other groups of people. The study also adds to the evidence that when young children are first immunized against influenza, they may benefit from getting a non-egg-based vaccine, as a person’s first exposure to influenza virus can play a role in shaping their immune response to subsequent influenza virus infection or flu vaccinations. Currently, recombinant and cell-based flu vaccines are the only flu vaccines made without the use of eggs that are licensed for use in the United States. The flu viruses used in the cell-based vaccines are grown in cultured cells of mammalian origin. Recombinant flu vaccines do not require the use of a candidate vaccine virus (CVV) for production because they are created synthetically. Some observational studies have shown greater protection against flu among people who received cell-based inactivated influenza vaccines compared with those who received standard-dose egg-based vaccines. Nevertheless, egg-based vaccines remain the most widely available flu vaccines and are an important preventive tool. The benefits of vaccination with any flu vaccine, including egg-based flu vaccine, still far outweigh the potential risks of not getting vaccinated. Currently CDC does not have a preference for the use of any one flu vaccine over another except among people 65 years and older. When available, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends people 65 years and older get a high-dose, an adjuvanted, or a recombinant flu vaccine because a review of existing studies suggested that, in this age group, these vaccines are potentially more effective than standard-dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines.

NEJM Leveraging Modernization of the US Influenza Vaccine Manufacturing Base to Make Better Vaccines: A Work in Progress Initial efforts to build up domestic vaccine manufacturing started in 2004. HHS funded contracts to bolster supplies of embryonated eggs so they were available year-round and to develop a cell-based influenza vaccine with a provision to build a domestic facility for vaccine production. BARDA followed these contracts with additional cell-based influenza vaccine, adjuvant, recombinant influenza vaccine, and influenza vaccine production facility contracts. In parallel, the DoD funded the development of alternate platforms for influenza vaccine production. These efforts have resulted in the licensure of new cell-based, recombinant, and adjuvanted or dose-sparing influenza vaccines. While the use of non-egg-based vaccines is growing, the field effectiveness data in the years since their licensure suggest that we are still being served by mediocre vaccines. Vaccine Insights Development of Cross-Reactive Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine Candidates against Both Lineages of Influenza B Virus The urgent need for broadly protective influenza B virus vaccines is underscored by the significant burden in the human population and the relatively high mutation rate of these viruses. A reverse genetics (RG) system is required to rapidly update the antigenic composition of vaccines, as well as to design LAIVs with a broader spectrum of protection. Such a system has been developed for the Russian LAIVs only for type A strains, but not for influenza B viruses (IBV). Vaccines Editor Pick Influenza Vaccine Development Share.

References By Emily Cooke published 31 January 2024 Infectious-disease experts explain why it's never too late in the season to get a flu vaccine.

There's still a benefit to getting vaccinated late in flu season, if you missed the ideal time window in the fall. (Image credit: SDI Productions via Getty Images) Each year, as fall brings shorter, colder days to the Northern Hemisphere, we're reminded to get vaccinated against the flu, or influenza. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone over 6 months old receive a flu shot every year. But is there a time limit on getting your flu shot? While it's best to get vaccinated before the season kicks off in earnest, it's still beneficial to get one toward the end of the season, two infectious-disease experts told Live Science.Related: Never-before-seen antibodies can target many flu virusesNormally, flu vaccines become available in late summer. Specific groups, such as pregnant people in their third trimesters, might consider vaccination in the summer. But the CDC recommends that most eligible people get vaccinated in the fall, by the end of October, as this is when cases begin to rise. "In the U.S., we often say to get vaccinated around October, because that's when cases start going up and we know that the flu vaccine gives you good protection over a certain period of time," Dr. Sabrina Assoumou, an associate professor of medicine at Boston University and an attending physician at Boston Medical Center, told Live Science. But if you miss that time window for some reason, you should still get a flu shot."Flu season typically continues through March, and it generally takes about two weeks after getting a flu shot for immunity to start kicking in," Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told Live Science in an email. So, if you haven't been vaccinated yet, it still makes sense to do so through the end of February, and maybe even into early March, he said. There would also be "no harm" in getting vaccinated after March or April, considering that influenza viruses circulate all year round, Kuritzkes said. However, practically speaking, the risk of catching flu in the spring or summer is "so low" that healthcare professionals don't generally focus on vaccinations once flu season is over, he said. If you haven't gotten sick by January, it may be tempting to think, "Oh, the holidays are done; I've dodged a bullet," Assoumou said. However, cases can still be seen later in flu season, and the later you get vaccinated, the shorter your window of available protection for that particular flu season, Assoumou added. Notably, the peak of flu season has been difficult to predict in recent years due to COVID-19. Flu transmission most often peaks in February in the U.S. — but the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily disrupted the timing of this. For instance, in 2020, flu transmission reached historically low levels. Between 2021 and 2022, flu infections began to rise again, peaking in late December 2021 then again in April 2022, but transmission rates stayed high until mid-June. However, between 2022 and 2023, transmission peaked in late November and early December. This suggests that "we're moving back towards more typical patterns in terms of influenza epidemiology," Kuritzkes said. Therefore, getting a flu shot in the fall continues to make the most sense, he said. The flu vaccine protects against the strains of influenza virus (illustrated above) predicted to be most prevalent in a given season. (Image credit: KATERYNA KON/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)But what if you've already had the flu this season? Is it still worth getting vaccinated afterward?Although it may seem counterintuitive, experts say yes. That's because many strains of influenza circulate each year. These strains fall into two broad categories — influenza A and influenza B — that are responsible for seasonal epidemics of the disease. "For reasons we don't fully understand, in a typical year the majority of cases seen early in flu season tend to be influenza A, whereas cases due to influenza B are more common later in the season," in February and March, Kuritzkes said. "Therefore, an unvaccinated person who gets flu in December or January from one type of influenza could still be susceptible to catching flu again later in the season from the other type," he said. The annual flu vaccine is designed to provide protection against the major strains of influenza that are expected to circulate in that particular season. Flu vaccines in the U.S. are "quadrivalent," meaning they protect against four strains. And even if you still get the flu after being vaccinated, you're much less likely to develop a severe infection or to be hospitalized, Assoumou said. "The role of these vaccines is to convert a severe infection into a mild one," she said. RELATED STORIES—'Long flu' is real, and we've likely 'ignored it for a long time'—Can you catch a cold and the flu at the same time?—Could we ever eradicate the flu?People often forget just how deadly the flu can be, so it is really important that everyone gets vaccinated, Assoumou said. This is especially true for people who are at a heightened risk of flu complications, such as those who are pregnant, over age 65 or have underlying chronic health conditions, such as asthma or heart disease, according to the CDC. Getting the flu vaccine is the "best way to protect yourself and the community" regardless of when you receive it, Assoumou said.

A new study suggests how those viruses can infect other species’ cells. miljko/Getty Images Share this:EmailFacebookTwitterPinterestPocketRedditPrint By Tina Hesman Saey January 31, 2024 at 2:00 pm Bird flu viruses may pack a little taste of home to help them adapt to life in new hosts. Viruses usually infect only certain types of hosts. For instance, many viruses that infect humans don’t infect other animals. But influenza viruses often seem to jump from birds to other species. In 2009, the H1N1 “swine flu” made the leap from birds to pigs and then into people, setting off a pandemic (SN: 12/18/09). Even now, an outbreak of avian influenza is infecting and killing birds, sea mammals and some other animals around the world (SN: 1/25/24). No one knows whether that flu virus may eventually infect people and, if it does, whether it will have the ability to spread easily and cause a pandemic. Tell us about your Science News experience Help us improve by taking our 15-question reader survey. Take the survey now Despite plenty of instances of bird flu viruses infecting people, scientists weren’t sure exactly how the viruses overtake other species’ cells. A new study offers a clue about one of the first steps avian influenza viruses use to adapt to infect humans and other animals. Avian influenza viruses tuck proteins that aid replication into their viral particles, researchers at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Harbin and colleagues have discovered. The reproductive aids, called ANP32 proteins, may help flu viruses make the jump from birds to mammals, the researchers report January 31 in Science Advances. The finding may help researchers better understand and predict which flu viruses have the potential to cause a pandemic. When viruses infect a host, they “don’t carry everything with them that they need, and they just hijack things that are already inside the cell” to help them replicate, says Wendy Barclay, a molecular virologist at Imperial College London. Researchers knew that the viruses come equipped with basic replication machinery called polymerases. But that may not be enough to really establish an infection. The viruses need to hijack host proteins to help the invaders quickly make copies of themselves. That includes ANP32 proteins, which help bring together proteins that form the polymerase copy machines. “Today’s flu virus needs this help in order to replicate itself fast enough inside any host cell so that it doesn’t get clobbered by our immune response and shut down,” says Barclay, who was not involved in the work. The researchers examined avian influenza proteins inside mammalian cells under electron microscopes and found that some viral particles carried a little bit of bird ANP32 with them. The protein is probably attached to the viral polymerase and gets bundled into the viral particle along with the rest of the replication machinery, the researchers discovered. The stronger the attraction between the polymerase and ANP32 proteins, the more helper protein that gets incorporated into viruses. It has been a mystery how avian influenza viruses, which have different ANP32 proteins than mammals do, could grab onto and use the ANP32 proteins in human and and other mammalian cells. Researchers thought that perhaps some flu viruses already had mutations that would allow viral polymerases to interact with mammalian ANP32 proteins. But the new study suggests that by packing their own bird versions of the proteins, flu viruses don’t immediately need to grab host ANP32 proteins. Instead, the virus can use the avian ANP32 protein for one round of copies inside the human or other animal cell. “This initial foothold maybe allows the virus to just replicate enough to make a few mutations,” Barclay says. Some of those mutations may then allow the bird version of the polymerase to interact with mammalian ANP32 proteins. Viruses that carried the bird version of ANP32 were more likely to acquire such adaptive mutations when grown in human cells or in mice, the researchers found. “This explains how avian viruses, which shouldn’t be able to replicate in human cells, are in fact able to replicate and evolve to interact with human ANP32,” says Jacob Yount, a viral immunologist at the Ohio State University College of Medicine in Columbus who was not involved in the research. Sponsor Message If the findings hold up to further investigation, scientists may be able predict which viruses are more likely to cause a pandemic by looking at the strength of interaction between the viral polymerase and ANP32, Barclay says. “There may be some [bird flu viruses] that are much better at pulling the ANP from the chicken or the duck into the human cell than others,” she says. “Those may be the ones which come in and get the foothold and get going with their evolution process more easily than ones [that] perhaps have a weaker interaction.” Questions or comments on this article?

There’s also this virus going around that’s giving kids red, goopy eyes, with a cold. They’re coming in for coughing and have runny noses, and their eyes are really affected. They’re not really being admitted. We do supportive care: Motrin, Tylenol, lots of fluids. And we’re still seeing strep throat. We’re seeing flu, but more of these other three things. And not much COVID. There is still some RSV but definitely on the downtrend, probably for the last threeish weeks or so.”OAKLAND COUNTY – Influenza, Covid, pneumonia, RSV, hand foot & mouth disease, slip and fall injuriesDr. Steven McGraw -- Chair of Emergency Medicine, Ascension Providence Hospital, Southfield & Novi Campus“I’m still seeing patients with COVID-19 and Flu, and still finding most of the COVID cases are mild enough for the patients to go home. A few are being admitted for dehydration/Kidney disease but also some with respiratory symptoms. Strep and GI Viruses are remaining common, too.”Dr. Rena Daiza -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Bloomfield Twp.“This week we continue to see flu, RSV, COVID-19 and hand foot and mouth diseases. These illnesses can lead to sinus infections, asthma, pneumonia and COPD flare-ups. It is important for people to take preventative measures like practicing good hygiene, staying up to date on vaccinations, sleeping well, being physically active, managing stress, drinking plenty of fluids and eating nutritious foods.”Emergency Department, Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital“We are seeing falls, respiratory issues and abdominal pain as the main complaints this week.”Dr. Justin Skrzynski -- Hospitalist, Corewell Health William Beaumont University Hospital, Royal Oak“Right now, the hospital is seeing very high patient volumes, especially respiratory illnesses such as influenza, COVID and other pneumonias. Having good overall health keeps people out of the hospital and now is a good time to make sure you’re up to date on routine checkups and vaccinations.”Dr. David Donaldson -- Emergency Chief, Corewell Health Beaumont Hospital, Troy“We are still seeing lots of upper respiratory, viral illness. These are mostly mild, except in the elderly or those with preexisting lung disease, in which case we are seeing greater severity. We are also seeing a lot slip and falls, due to icy conditions and mostly minor injuries due to an increase in weather related automobile accidents.”WASHTENAW COUNTY – Influenza, Covid, upper respiratory infections, slip & fall injuries, stomach viruses, RSVDr. Marisa Louie -- Medical Director of Children’s Emergency Services, Michigan Medicine“We are seeing a lot of vomiting and diarrhea illnesses lately, plus continued influenza and RSV.”Dr. Brad Uren -- Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine“Still a lot of COVID and flu.

However, data suggests the virus may be on the retreat.As of Jan. 26, the only other states in the South reporting such levels of illness were South Carolina and Louisiana, the CDC reported. The rest of the region is reporting "high" activity levels, though Florida has been downgraded to "moderate" levels of flu spread.There have, so far, been 57 reported pediatric flu deaths this season, according to the CDC.All statewide data is preliminary. Ratings on activity levels are based on reports of influenza-like illnesses reported by health centers in given jurisdictions as compared to reports during non-flu season months.Key national flu findingsAccording to the CDC:Seasonal influenza activity remains elevated in most parts of the countryKey flu indicators have decreased or remained stable nationally for three weeks.The number of weekly flu hospital admissions has decreased for three consecutive weeks.There have been at least 18 million illnesses, 210,000 hospitalizations, and 13,000 deaths from flu so far this season.Tennessee flu cases remain high but are droppingAccording to the most recent information from the Tennessee Department of Health, the percentage of outpatient visits related to flu-like illnesses dropped from 11.1% to 9.5%. Even so, the percentage of laboratory-confirmed cases were up from 16.6% to 21.5%, the department reported on Jan. 13.Tennessee has reported two pediatric flu deaths this season.The statewide average is 9.5%, according to the department.

A December study published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences highlighted the researchers’ newest discovery: a site, or epitope, on the influenza virus molecule that could potentially allow scientists to target multiple strains of influenza with the same antibodies. “The problem is that the [current] vaccines aren’t particularly good,” said Garnett Kelsoe, James B. Duke distinguished professor of immunology at the School of Medicine and researcher on the project. “In fact, on average, their efficacy measured as protection against disease, not just infection, … is only about 50% over a 20-year average in Europe and the United States.” This inefficacy is largely due to the emergence of new strains each season, created by evolutionary pressures on the virus to mutate. Scientists participate in annual guesswork to predict the next dominant variant. Occasionally, Kelsoe said, they guess incorrectly. “You have to update the vaccine every few years and try to come up with a better match for future strains,” said Michael Moody, professor of pediatrics and immunology at the School of Medicine. “... [The] flu is going to diversify. We can try to deal with that diversity, or we can try to look at areas of the virus that are relatively constant and try to attack those.” Kelsoe and his team began their search in hopes of producing a vaccine that would have longer-lasting effects against a larger variety of influenza strains, reducing the need for a yearly shot. They searched for virus structures that are present in all flu viruses, instead of specific strains, as well as virus sites that cannot be easily changed. The newly discovered epitope is present in over 90% of all known virus molecules, making it an ideal candidate for vaccine targeting. If developed, a vaccine designed to detect this epitope in different flu variants could provide widespread protection and alleviate the scientific community of the uncertainty involved in predicting the newest strain. Kelsoe said that the vaccine would not completely stop the spread of the virus. Rather, it would allow small levels of transmission, producing only mild effects in the host. Allowing the virus to replicate would also reduce the evolutionary pressure that drives the emergence of new strains. “We would love a vaccine that completely prevented infection. That's not really what vaccines are designed to do,” Moody said. This research came amidst rising flu deaths in North Carolina and a 5-year low in flu vaccinations. The researchers hope that a longer-lasting flu vaccine, which would not require yearly shots, could encourage vaccine compliance. “A universal vaccine would be something that might cure, or at least help cure, vaccine hesitancy,” Kelsoe said. He explained that it would be easier to convince people to take a vaccine that was more effective and would last multiple years. Moody is more unsure. “I don’t know if getting a better vaccine will actually increase acceptance rates,” he said. “... There is a tremendous mistrust of experts now.” For Moody, the overarching goal is simple: to improve communication with the public about vaccines. So far, the research has only been tested in mice. After being infected with 10 to 20 times the ‘lethal’ dose of influenza virus, the mice who were introduced to the epitope-targeting antibodies survived with little to no change in weight. Those who were not part of the treatment group experienced significant weight loss, a key indicator of illness, and eventually died. The changes seem promising. Kelsoe hopes that a vaccine could be produced as soon as 3 to 4 years from now. “We know that the epitope is highly immunogenic — it would be a good vaccine candidate.” Moody asserted the importance of bringing the research to trials in primates, noting that sometimes “mice lie.” “Of course, what we all want is a one-shot vaccine that will protect you for the rest of your life against all flu strains and has no side effects,” he said. “But that’s not how the real world works, so we’re trying to use the tools we have to solve these problems.” Read more Duke students voting in Durham: Should they have a say on bond referenda? 5 interesting classes to consider during drop/add Duke hosts National Veterans Day commemoration ceremony Get The Chronicle straight to your inbox Signup for our weekly newsletter.

February 2nd, 2024 Respiratory illnesses are on the rise this winter season. But it can be difficult to determine whether your illness is RSV, the flu, or COVID-19. While taking a COVID-19 test is the only assured way to determine on your own if you have contracted that virus, being aware of their respective symptoms can help inform your treatment. In all cases, it is recommended that you rest, take time to recover at home, and wear a mask when around others to limit the spread of illness. "We may not be able to eliminate these illnesses altogether, but we certainly can take measures to mitigate them as cases of COVID-19, flu, and RSV go up," says Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center’s Chief Quality Officer Michael Calderwood, MD, MPH, a specialist in infectious diseases. "And doing what we can to prevent and keep them from getting worse and spreading is even more important as hospitals fill up and business and schools are impacted by increases in the community." The range of early symptoms While differences can seem subtle, some exist, and these can serve as signposts when you first become ill. "It can be hard to distinguish between illnesses caused by the different respiratory viruses, but generally speaking, the flu often comes on quickly, typically with fever, chills, body aches, fatigue, and a dry cough," says Calderwood. In contrast to the flu, RSV usually comes on gradually. "People often report congestion, such as a runny or stuffy nose, at times accompanied by sneezing," he says. "Wheezing (a high-pitched whistling with breathing) is also seen more often with RSV than with the other respiratory viruses." COVID-19 is different from flu or RSV in that it can appear in different forms. "While we see many of the same symptoms such as cough, fatigue, and headache, COVID-19 may also present with nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, or sudden loss of taste and/or smell. A sore throat also seems to be more common with COVID-19 than with flu or RSV," says Calderwood. When in doubt about what respiratory illness you might have, always test for COVID-19. To purchase a test, you can go to your local pharmacy. The federal government still offers free rapid COVID-19 tests through the mail. You can order 4 free tests at COVIDTests.gov and they will be delivered by the U.S. Postal Service. How to treat When these illnesses are not severe, rest, fluids, and good care can go a long way toward recovery, but keeping a close eye on the severity of any illness is important. Remember, too, that if you are concerned about how an illness is presenting, consult your doctor. For RSV For RSV, it is particularly important to closely monitor adults and children with certain existing medical problems—such as heart disease, cystic fibrosis, and certain lung diseases. The elderly have weaker immune systems overall, so keep a close eye on them. Babies in their first respiratory virus season can be particularly at risk with RSV, points out Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center Section Chief of General Pediatrics, Susanne Tanski, MD, MPH. That’s because not only do people get the sickest when first exposed to the respiratory illness, but a baby’s tiny airways can lead to more severe disease, she says. For flu Flu, like all illnesses, also should be monitored. The CDC, in its flu treatment recommendations, suggests that antiviral drugs may be a treatment option for some, particularly those at higher risk. Consult your doctor to find out if they are right for you. Antiviral drugs work best when started early, such as 1 to 2 days after your flu symptoms begin. People at higher risk of flu complications include young children, adults 65 years of age and older, pregnant people, and people with certain medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease. For COVID-19 The CDC offers guidelines on how to treat COVID-19 and says that most symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. The FDA also has authorized or approved several antiviral medications used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in people who are more likely to get very ill. Those more at risk include adults aged 50 or older, people who are unvaccinated or not up-to-date on their vaccines, and people with certain medical conditions. A healthcare provider will help decide which treatment is right for you. If you are taking other medications, check with your provider or pharmacist to make sure the COVID-19 treatments can be safely taken at the same time. Prevention All people, but especially those in high-risk categories, can take precautions to stave off illness by wearing masks, avoiding crowded places, and washing their hands. If you are sick, stay home and keep away from other people. Be sure to get your vaccines, too. The most recent COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax help lower chances of serious illness or hospitalization, including this season’s COVID-19 variant JN.1. If you already have had COVID-19 and are wondering if you need another vaccination, Calderwood provides these tips. The latest data on the protection that these new vaccines provide in the current respiratory virus season has just been published. As far as the flu, most people need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the season, ideally prior to November. However, says the CDC, vaccination should continue throughout the season as long as influenza viruses are circulating. To help prevent or minimize the effects of RSV, the CDC says adults 60 years of age and older have the option to receive a single dose of the RSV vaccine, based on discussions between the patient and their healthcare provider. It also recommends that pregnant women get a single dose of RSV vaccine between week 32 through week 36 of pregnancy. For those with babies under the age of 8 months, parents should ask their pediatrician about Nirsevimab, the new passive immunization that protects babies from severe RSV disease. Concludes Calderwood: "Staying up to date with your vaccines, taking measures to protect and care for yourself and your loved ones, and being aware if you are at higher risk of severe illness, all can go a long way toward mitigating their severity and keeping these illnesses from spreading further this winter season."

Christopher Michel/Flickr cc The samples that tested positive were from a gentoo penguin and two chicks found dead off the coast of the Falklands Islands, considered a subantarctic region that is off the southern tip of Argentina. According to the Falklands Islands government website, the gentoo penguins were found on the Sea Lion Islands and were among a group of about 35 adults and chicks that were found sick or dead. The Sea Lion Islands are the southernmost group of inhabited islands in the Falklands Islands archipelago. Suspected H5N1 in second penguin species The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, in its list of avian flu detections in the subantarctic and Antarctic regions, noted the confirmation in gentoo penguins. It also reported a suspected detection in king penguins from Fortuna Bay on the northeast coast of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The area is about 925 miles east of the Falklands Islands. Cases follow first detection in Antarctic sea mammals The suspected sample in the king penguins follows the recent detection of the virus elephant seals and fur seals from South Georgia an the South Sandwich Islands, which marked the first detection in mammals from the subantarctic region. Animal health groups have warned about the risk of further spread of H5N1 to Antarctica's wildlife, especially given that some species, including penguins, live in dense colonies. Excess death due to COVID in immunosuppressed populations varies News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 Katarzyna Bialasiewicz / iStock Immunosuppressed patient populations, including cancer patients and those with HIV, have different rates of excess mortality attributed to COVID-19, according to an analysis of 99 studies published in the Journal of Infection. The study, which attempted to standardize a method for categorizing the immunosuppressed as a clinical risk group, found that solid-organ transplant recipients and patients undergoing cancer treatment had a higher risk of mortality than COVID-19 patients with healthy immune systems. The 99 studies included in the analysis were published between 2020 and 2022 and included 1,542,097 and 56,248,181 unique immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients with COVID-19 infection, respectively. Solid-organ transplant patients most at risk The odds ratio (OR) for mortality for solid-organ transplant recipients compared to immunocompetent patients was 2.12 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50 to 2.99) and was 2.02 (95% CI, 1.69 to 2.42) for cancer patients. People with rheumatologic autoimmune diseases and HIV had an only slightly elevated mortality risk compared to immunocompetent patients (ORs, 1.28 and 1.20, respectively). The authors said the findings, "may prove beneficial for prioritising scarce medical resources including booster vaccine doses, novel therapeutics and passive forms of immunisation such as convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibody transfusion." Nontuberculous mycobacteria outbreak linked to Florida cosmetic surgery clinic News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Healthcare-Associated Infections A cluster of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) skin infections across nine states has been linked to cosmetic surgery procedures and gaps in infection control at a clinic in Florida, researchers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) reported last week in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. After a non-Florida resident was identified with an NTM infection following a cosmetic procedure at a south Florida surgical clinic in February 2023, the CDC and FDOH issued a national Epidemic Information Exchange notice in March 2023 to identify additional cases. The subsequent investigation identified an additional 15 NTM infections in patients from nine states who underwent procedures at the same clinic (clinic A). An additional four patients experienced signs and symptoms of post-surgical infection but lacked confirmatory lab results. The infections were caused by Mycbobacterium abscessus, a multidrug-resistant NTM known to cause skin and soft-tissue infections following cosmetic procedures. The 15 case-patients were all women in their early 30s whose symptoms began a median of 69 days after the procedure. Treatment required prolonged courses of oral and intravenous antibiotics. Gaps in infection control Clinic A was shut down, and although the source of the initial NTM infection was not identified, an infection control assessment at clinic B—which had the same surgeon, staff, and protocols as clinic A—by FDOH detected gaps in environmental cleaning practices, use of personal protective equipment, and surgical device disinfection. "FDOH will use these findings to develop additional training for cosmetic surgery clinic staff members statewide to help prevent future outbreaks in this setting," the authors wrote, adding that healthcare providers should be on the lookout for extrapulmonary NTM when evaluating patients for postsurgical infection after cosmetic procedures. CWD found in another Wyoming deer hunt area News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Chronic Wasting Disease Michael Matti / Flickr cc The Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) reports that chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been identified in a buck mule deer in Deer Hunt Area 90 for the first time.In a news release, WGFD said yesterday that the CWD case was confirmed in December.Deer Hunt Area 90 is in the Lander region and borders Deer Hunt Areas 36, 89, 97, 157, and 160, all of which have had CWD cases.CWD is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by infectious misfolded proteins called prions. While CWD is not yet known to infect humans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises hunters to not consume meat from any animal that is obviously ill or tests positive for the disease. Quick takes: RSV vaccine for younger adults, PAHO measles alert, Zimbabwe cholera vaccination News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Cholera Foodborne Disease Measles Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) The European Medicines Agency is reviewing GSK's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine Arexvy for use in adults ages 50 to 59 who are at increased risk of complications from the disease. In a statement, GSK said its submission follows positive phase 3 trial findings that evaluated the vaccine in the expanded age-group. Arexvy is already approved in multiple countries for use in adults ages 60 and older. In December, Japan's health ministry accepted the company's submission for expanded use in adults ages 50 to 59. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) yesterday issued an epidemiologic alert for measles, warning about ongoing challenges with suboptimal vaccine coverage, a global increase in cases, and recent reports of imported cases in Americas region countries. According to World Health Organization (WHO) data, measles cases globally in 2023 rose 64% over the previous year. Nations in the Americas that have reported cases already this year, mostly imported, include Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, the United States, and Peru. Zimbabwe has been battling a cholera outbreak since February 2023, and yesterday the country launched a cholera vaccine campaign with a goal of immunizing 2 million people, according to a media report. The health ministry will receive a total of 2.3 million oral cholera vaccine doses from the WHO and UNICEF and has already more than 892,000 doses. The campaign will focus on 29 of Zimbabwe's hardest-hit districts.

Scientists at the Center for Translational Antiviral Research in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State University investigated how differences in specific microbial species can influence outcomes of respiratory virus infections, which has previously not been well defined. They reported that the composition of microbiota in the gut influences how susceptible mice are to respiratory virus infections and the severity of these infections. Segmented filamentous bacteria A bacterial species found in the intestines, named segmented filamentous bacteria, protected mice against influenza virus infection when these bacteria were either naturally acquired or administered. Also, this protection applied to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The segmented filamentous bacteria needed basally resident alveolar macrophages to maintain this protection. Mice with discrete microbiome differences and mice differing in only the presence or absence of segmented filamentous bacteria were studied. Several days after infection, viral titers in the lung were measured. The researchers observed that they varied greatly depending on the microbiome of the different animal groups. Co-senior author of the study Dr Andrew Gewirtz, Regents’ Professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State, explained: “These findings uncover complex interactions that mechanistically link the intestinal microbiota with the functionality of basally resident alveolar macrophages and severity of respiratory virus infection.” Basally resident alveolar macrophages Basally resident alveolar macrophages were quickly depleted as respiratory virus infection progressed in segmented filamentous bacteria-negative mice. In segmented filamentous bacteria-colonised mice, basally resident alveolar macrophages were altered to resist influenza virus infection depletion and inflammatory signalling. These macrophages disabled the influenza virus, mostly by activating a part of the immune system called the complement system. Dr Richard Plemper, co-senior author of the study, Regents’ Professor and director of the Center for Translational Antiviral Research at Georgia State, commented: “We find it remarkable that the presence of a single common commensal bacterial species, amidst the thousands of different microbial species that inhabit the mouse gut, had such strong impacts in respiratory virus infection models and that such impacts were largely attributable to reprogramming of basally resident alveolar macrophages.” Dr Gewirtz added that the team think it is highly unlikely that segmented filamentous bacteria is the only gut microbe capable of impacting the phenotype of alveolar macrophages. He continued: “Rather, we hypothesise that gut microbiota composition broadly influences proneness to respiratory virus infection. Microbiota mediated programming of basally resident alveolar macrophages may not only influence the severity of acute respiratory virus infection but may also be a long-term post-respiratory virus infection health determinant.” Dr Plemper noted: “If applicable to human infections, these findings will have major implications for the future risk assessment of a patient to advance to severe disease.” The study was published in Cell Host & Microbe.

The flu, also known as H5N1, appeared in South America in 2022 and made its way to Patagonian Argentina by August 2023, resulting in extreme mortality among newborn elephant seals. This year, environmental groups are rushing to learn more about the disease and what can be done to prevent it from spreading to other parts of the ecosystem. “There’s no precedent for a mortality from a highly pathogenic avian influenza like this [in Patagonia],” said Julieta Campagna, who runs coastal protected area monitoring for the NGO Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Argentina. “When we first started recording cases, it was mostly seals. Then we started to worry what would happen to other species.” Cases were first detected in South American terns (Sterna hirundinacea) before moving onto sea lions (Otaria flavescens), fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) and southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). H5N1 is present in the provinces of Tierra del Fuego, Santa Cruz, Buenos Aires, Rio Negro and Chubut, according to Argentina’s National Food Safety and Quality Service. Many scientists were surprised that the disease jumped from birds to mammals, especially since seals don’t feed on terns. Dead elephant seals on a beach in Argentina. (Photo by Maxi Jonas/WCS) Elephant seals were hit the hardest. On the Valdés Peninsula in Chubut, the mortality rate of newborn elephant seals was believed to be as high as 96% last year, compared to 1% or less in 2022, according to a WCS report. A study published in the journal Marine Mammal Science in December and coauthored by Campagna estimated that 17,400 of the 18,000 elephant seal pups born last year died from Avian flu on the coasts of Chubut. Some adult seals were affected, as well. On one high-density part of the coast, 10 adult males and 36 females were found dead, whereas in previous years even one adult carcass was considered a “rare” event, according to the study. Especially concerning is the death of young female seals, Campagna said. Without them, reproduction rates could be low again this year — and possibly for years to come. “We don’t know what’s going to happen to the population,” she said. “For the elephant seal, with the decline that it had last year, with a season where there were basically no calves, that’s going to have an impact on the ecosystem in the long run.” Because the disease appears to be mutating quickly, scientists are also concerned about a second wave this year, as well as the possibility that it could jump to still more species. Orcas (Orcinus orca) seem like a likely candidate, Campagna said, because they feed on seals. Humans could also catch it if tourists crowd beaches and get too close to sick animals. Right now, there aren’t any confirmed cases in whales or humans in Argentina, according to Valeria Falabella, the director of coastal-marine conservation at WCS. But there are human cases in other parts of the world, including Chile. When animals contract avian flu, there isn’t much people can do except close the beach and leave them alone, Campagna said. There are no vaccines or medications. But WCS and other organizations — including the University of California, Davis — are analyzing samples taken during the worst of the outbreak to better understand how it mutated and spread in hopes of identifying new waves of infection. They’re also in communication with researchers in Chile, Peru, Brazil and Uruguay, where similar cases have been recorded, to understand the different mutations in the region. Until that happens, the most they can do is monitor population trends and hope for the best. “We have to keep monitoring the populations affected by this epidemic,” Campagna said. “It’s the only way to understand their ability to recover or not.” Citation: Campagna, C., Uhart, M., Falabella, V., Campagna, J., Zavattieri, V., Vanstreels, R.

This opens the way to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the replication of this virus with high pandemic potential.​ Published on 30 January 2024 Body textEvery year, the influenza virus infects between 2 and 6 million people in France. Other influenza viruses, that are very similar to the human influenza virus, cause epizootics that also threaten the human health, as they can cross the species barrier with new viral forms emerging. In particular, the avian influenza epizootic that has been raging in Europe since October 2021 is affecting domestic and wild birds with unprecedented virulence and contagiousness. Given this situation, the WHO has placed the various influenza virus strains under very close surveillance.Further upstream, scientists at Irig are seeking to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that enable the influenza virus to mutate or adapt to other species. The genome of this family of viruses is fragmented in eight single-stranded RNA molecules. Each RNA fragment is covered with multiple copies of the viral nucleoprotein, and both fragment ends interact with a viral RNA polymerase (involved in the virus proliferation). Each of these eight assemblies forms a ribonucleoprotein complex, with an extremely flexible and dynamic architecture. Until now, scientists have extracted ribonucleoprotein complexes directly from viruses in order to observe them by cryo-electron microscopy, but they have been unable to elucidate their detailed structures due to a lack of sufficient material and technical limitations.Production of analogues in vitroTo circumvent this difficulty, the scientists at Irig chose not to use viral extracts but instead to use their expertise in the expression and purification of viral nucleoproteins produced in vitro (recombinant). They developed a protocol to generate analogues of ribonucleoprotein complexes in vitro by self-assembly of nucleoproteins and small RNA probes. Thanks to this new approach, they were able to produce enough biological material to observe these complexes at high resolution.Using state-of-the-art equipment and a very large dataset, they were able to reconstruct an initial three-dimensional model at nanometric resolution, which they were then able to refine to a resolution of 0.5 nanometres (10-9 m).With a high-resolution 3D reconstruction of analogues of influenza ribonucleoprotein complexes, scientists can now describe the interactions between the nucleoproteins within them. These appear to be very similar to those observed in the 3D structures of smaller biological assemblies previously obtained by X-ray diffraction. More interestingly, the new reconstruction at sub-nanometric resolution reveals for the first time the arrangement of the RNA in the complexes. While the RNA appears to be involved in structuring the ribonucleoprotein complexes, it also appears to slide freely across the surface of the proteins, most likely to facilitate access to the RNA polymerase and thus enable replication of the virus.

Researchers from the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) discovered about 35 penguins dead on the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic on January 19. Ralph Vanstreels, a veterinarian working with SCAR, confirmed that samples from two of the dead penguins tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza virus. According to Falkland Islands government spokesperson Sally Heathmanas, as of 30 January, “there are over 200 chicks dead alongside a handful of adults.”Bird populations affected globallyThe incident underscores the vulnerability of gentoo penguins to the lethal disease that has affected bird populations globally. Despite the geographical distance between the Falkland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula – roughly 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) – gentoo penguins’ unlikely travel between these regions suggests a lower risk of the virus spreading to the southern continent. Bracing for a widespread outbreak However, Vanstreels, affiliated with the University of California-Davis, highlighted a critical concern. “The role that gentoo penguins could have, instead, is to serve as local reservoirs of infection,” he said.Further tests are pending for rockhopper penguins, with the Falkland Islands government bracing for a widespread outbreak. In South Georgia, Meagan Dewar, who leads SCAR’s Antarctic Wildlife Health Network, ruled out bird flu in king penguins after a comprehensive survey. Increasing concernThe densely packed penguin colonies in Antarctica and nearby islands could facilitate rapid virus transmission among individuals, causing significant concern among conservationists. Vanstreels expressed particular worry about other species, noting the larger number of elephant seals and fur seals succumbing to the bird flu in South Georgia and South America. “This is especially concerning because South Georgia is home to 95 percent of the world’s population of Antarctic fur seals,” he said, underscoring the dire implications for the species if the population collapses.H5N1 avian influenza virusThe H5N1 avian influenza virus, commonly known as bird flu, is a type of influenza virus that primarily affects birds, but can also infect humans and other animals. It is a highly pathogenic strain, meaning it has the potential to cause severe disease and high mortality rates in poultry. The virus is categorized under the type A influenza viruses, which are known for their ability to cause pandemics.Pandemic potential The H5N1 virus first gained attention in 1997 during an outbreak in Hong Kong, where it was transmitted from birds to humans, leading to six deaths. This was the first instance of a direct bird-to-human transmission of avian influenza, raising global concerns about its potential to cause a pandemic. Since then, outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza have been reported in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, affecting both wild birds and domestic poultry. Human cases of H5N1 infection are rare but can occur after direct or close contact with infected birds or contaminated environments. Human-to-human transmission is extremely rare.SymptomsInfection with H5N1 in humans can lead to severe respiratory illness and has a high mortality rate. Symptoms are similar to other types of flu and can include fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches, but can quickly progress to severe respiratory issues and pneumonia.Control and prevention Control and prevention measures for H5N1 avian influenza focus on reducing the risk of transmission from birds to humans. These measures include monitoring and surveillance of poultry farms, culling infected or exposed birds, vaccination of poultry, and implementing biosecurity practices. For humans, avoiding contact with infected birds, practicing good personal hygiene, and following travel advisories to areas with known outbreaks are recommended precautions.Ongoing research Research and development of vaccines for H5N1 are ongoing, with some vaccines available for use in poultry and others being developed for humans. However, the effectiveness of these vaccines can vary due to the virus’s ability to mutate rapidly, leading to new strains that vaccines may not protect against.Like what you read?

Hereâs what else you should know about the ever-circulating virus.1. The flu vaccine canât give you the flu.The vaccines contain a dead piece of the flu virus, and a dead virus canât infect you. There is a nasal vaccine that contains a live virus, but that particular vaccine is designed to seek and destroy the part of the virus that actually makes you sick.2. You can treat the flu.Up to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms, a doctor can prescribe antiviral medicine that will help. Itâs not going to get rid of the virus entirely, but it will lessen the time that youâre curled up on the couch, watching game shows and cursing life.3. The 1918-1920 flu outbreak is the best-known influenza pandemic.The flu ward at Walter Reed Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, circa World War I. / Heritage Images/GettyImagesThe so-called Spanish Flu killed between 40 million and 100 million people worldwide at the tail-end of World War I. It was so severe that it registered a Level 5 (the maximum) on the Pandemic Severity Scale. The mortality rate was, by some estimates, as high as 20 percent. People that got it and survived include Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Walt Disney, Mary Pickford, General John J. Pershing, and Woodrow Wilson.5. The flu can still be deadly.In the U.S. alone, the flu season results in 36,000-ish deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations. As if those facts werent painful enough, the seasonal flu costs Americans a collective $10 billion annually.6. British students come down with the âfreshers flu.âWhile we in the U.S. have âfreshman 15,â the Brits have âfreshers flu.â Up to 90 percent of people during their first few weeks at college end up getting sick, and whether itâs actually the flu or not (itâs often just a cold), the nickname has a nice ring to it.7. People who say they have the âstomach fluâ probably don't.âStomach fluâ is a nickname that came about because it makes you feel crappy in similar ways to the real flu. But if you have only a stomach ache without additional body aches or fever, you probably just have a gastrointestinal virus of some sort.8. You don't need to âstarve a fever.âA woman wears a âflu maskâ in the early 20th century. / Hulton Deutsch/GettyImagesThere isnât much truth in the old saying, âfeed a cold, starve a fever.â Fever is one of the main symptoms of the flu, and if you have one, you should increase your fluid intake. But thereâs no need to decrease the amount of food you eat. In fact, nibbling on healthy meals will help your body recover from the virus.9. The flu has been around for a long time.The Greek physician Hippocrates wrote of an illness with a description closely matching todayâs modern flu symptoms.10. The most recent flu pandemic was in 2009.The (H1N1)pdm09 flu virus emerged in April 2009, and because it was so different than earlier mutations of the H1N1 virus, few people under the age of 60 had immunity to it. The CDC estimates that between April 2009 and April 2010, there were about 61 million cases of (H1N1)pdm09 flu, about 274,000 hospitalizations, and more than 12,000 deaths in the U.S. alone.A version of this story was published in 2008; it has been updated for 2024.Related TagsWARFACTSSCIENCEFOODHEALTHMEDICINELISTSDISNEYHistoryGAMEHome / HEALTHABOUTCONTACT USNEWSLETTERSPRIVACY POLICYCOOKIE POLICYTERMS OF SERVICEACCESSIBILITY STATEMENTSITEMAPA-Z IndexCookie PreferencesÂ© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved38 cats died after eating bird-flu-tainted cat food in 2023 | PetfoodIndustryNews & NewslettersExpert InsightsPetfood ForumCareer CenterMagazineMoreSign InMarket Trends & ReportsNutritionSafety & QualityProductionPackagingSustainabilityRegionsPet Food MarketMarket Trends & ReportsTop Pet Food CompaniesTop Companies Data ReportsPet Food Company ProfilesPet Food Product DatabaseTopicsNutritionSafety & QualityProductionPackagingSustainabilityRegionsMarketing/BrandingLawsuitsExpert InsightsBlogs & ColumnsTrending: Pet Food PodcastMagazineWebinarsBrand InsightsWhite PapersCustom PublicationsResourcesSign InIndustry CalendarDirectory of SuppliersPetfood Industry Product PortfolioCareer CenterSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsFollow PetfoodIndustryFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconSign InFollow PetfoodIndustryFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconMarket Trends & ReportsNutritionSafety & QualityProductionPackagingSustainabilityRegionsTop Pet Food CompaniesPetfood ForumIndustry CalendarPet Food Product DatabaseDirectory of SuppliersMagazineSubscribeAdvertiseSafety & QualityPet Food Safety38 cats died after eating bird-flu-tainted cat food in 2023Considering the South Korean outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1), scientists made suggestions to avoid future disease spillover and reduce the potential for disease to spread to humans.Tim WallJanuary 30, 2024Andrea GantzThe SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes COVID-19 disease, seems to be zoonotic, meaning the virus moved into humans from wild animals. Diseases can also pass from wildlife to livestock, zoo animals and companion animals, including a small number of dogs and cats that caught COVID-19. This phenomenon of one non-human species passing a disease to another can be called spillover. Those animals don’t need to be in direct contact with each other for spillover to occur. On July 25 and 31 of last year, health officials confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) infections in two cat shelters in Seoul, South Korea. A team of researchers examined this outbreak and published a summary in Nature Communications, along with suggestions for controlling future cross-species disease transmission.“The influenza A(H5N1) outbreaks in the cat shelters in South Korea, along with an increasing number of reports of influenza A(H5N1) infection in mammals, suggest the need to enhance the effectiveness of infectious disease surveillance and prevention in any settings where a group of potentially susceptible animals are kept in close contact,” they wrote. “This is particularly important for groups of animals that typically are not covered by regulatory efforts aimed at maintaining or improving animal health and welfare standards. These animal groups could not only provide environments for cross-species viral transmission, promoting zoonotic risk, but could also serve as sentinels for detecting such events, thereby offering opportunities to assess and then mitigate such risk.”H5N1 avian flu can spread to and kill humans. Between 2003 and 2023, the World Health Organization received 882 reports of human infection with H5N1 bird flu in 23 countries. Of these, 461 cases were fatal. Interspecies transmission of diseases can be fatal for the animals as well.South Korean bird flu outbreak among shelter catsIn the case last year at one of the cat shelters in South Korea, 38 out of the 40 infected cats died within a month. The shelter cats had all been kept indoors, so it seemed unlikely that wild birds had spread the pathogen to the cats. Instead, the virus may have spread to the cats through their food. Investigators with South Korea’s Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) detected influenza A(H5N1) virus in cat food from one of the shelters. The cat foods were Balanced Duck and Balanced Chicken manufactured by Nature's Raw at its facility in Gimpo, west of Seoul. The Ministry stated that the company had failed to follow necessary sterilization steps since May 25 due to an equipment malfunction. MAFRA officials then ordered the recall of all cat food batches considered at risk of harboring the virus. Approximately 13,200 units had already been sold to 286 pet owners. However, these pet owners reported no signs of infection in their cats. The virus may have entered the cat food stream during an outbreak of the virus on South Korean poultry, including duck, farms that lasted until April 2023. While it seems likely that these farm infections may have been the source of the virus that infected the cats, the authors of the Nature paper noted that no conclusive evidence has been released by MAFRA. It is also unknown if the cats also spread the virus among each other, or if the disease always came from the cat food.No humans in contact with the cats have tested positive for avian influenza. Although cats can contract highly pathogenic avian influenza, epidemiologists believe cats are not a significant vector for the disease and do not play a major role in transmitting avian influenza to people or other animals.Avian influenza infection of catsAvian influenza or bird flu naturally spreads among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species, according to the World Health Organization. Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a subtype of the virus. It can cause severe illness and high mortality rates in domestic poultry and wild birds. The viruses can devastate poultry industries and have economic repercussions due to trade restrictions. Some varieties, including H5N1, can cross species barriers and may cause severe illnesses in mammals.In June, 2023, the IHR National Focal Point of Poland notified the World Health Organization of unusual deaths in cats across the country, suspected to be caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza. As of July 11, 47 samples had been tested from 46 cats and one captive caracal. Twenty-five samples tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza. Fourteen cats were euthanized. A further 11 died with the last death reported on June 30. Some cats developed severe symptoms, such as labored breathing, bloody diarrhea and neurological signs. Some of the cats deteriorated rapidly and died. In total, 20 cats had neurological signs, 19 had respiratory signs and 17 had both signs. Monitoring and controlling disease spillover among pet cats and dogsThe outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza among the shelter cats was a rarity. The fact that the cats were all in one place may have been a major reason why the disease was discovered as the culprit, the study authors wrote. In individual homes, a cat infected with avian flu might have been diagnosed as suffering from another more common disease. Multiple cats getting the same disease were more easily observed in a shelter. Likewise in a home, the virus wouldn’t have had the opportunity to spread among various animals, if that indeed happened.Considering the South Korean outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1), the scientists made suggestions to avoid future disease spillover and reduce zoonotic potential.1. Require pet shelters to systematically record adverse animal health events at individual animal and group levels. In outbreak situations, pet shelters should also record environmental factors (e.g. access to/from wildlife, and introduction of new animals) and husbandry conditions (e.g. food and water source). “In the event of cross-species viral transmission, this information will help to better understand the source of infection and thus inform the implementation of preventive and control measures,” the scientists wrote. “Such a recording practice appears to have been lacking in these particular settings, very much in contrast to conventional livestock farming where the recording is routinely practiced.2. Training shelter staff to report any unusual clinical signs or health trends among animals in the shelter. Animal health authorities need to precisely define reporting criteria and ensure shelter staff are familiar with those criteria.3. The potential for undercooked poultry to transmit avian influenza justifies prohibiting or limiting the feeding of uncooked meat to animals kept for non-conventional production purposes, such as pet shelters and fur farms, and those in non-agricultural settings. These restrictions could minimise the risk of cross-species transmission of influenza A(H5N1) virus and other viruses. 4. Continue discussing how to implement measures to prevent and control cross-species viral transmission. “It is crucial to involve all relevant stakeholders in this discussion, particularly the staff of the aforementioned animal settings, as their understanding of the implications of animal keeping for animal and human health might be less than amongst those involved in conventional livestock farming,” they wrote.RecommendedPet Food MarketNew Zealand pet food cannery expands into North AmericaPet Food NewsCompanions and Animals for Reform and Equity receives PetSmart grantRelated StoriesPet Food SafetyPurina PetCare refutes TikTok rumors about sick dogsPet Food SafetyLawsuit alleges Mid America Pet Food caused dog death, child illnessPet Food SafetyEmployee issues among top manufacturing safety concernsPet Food SafetyHill’s Pet Nutrition marks safety advancements with wet food plantMore in Pet Food SafetyEuropeIrish pet food facilities, renderers criticized by EU auditorsEU auditors called Irish facility inspectors unreliable and accused them of approving dirty and unhygienic conditions that breached food safety regulations.Pet Food PackagingSustainability a challenge, innovation an opportunity in pet food packagingUnsurprisingly, sustainability is still top-of-mind for the pet food packaging world, and innovation is a sought-after way of continuing to move forward.News HoundCould pet cats or dogs trigger an avian influenza pandemic?Proactive steps may help pet food companies mitigate the risk of avian influenza becoming the next pandemic.Pet Food SafetyBeyond policies and procedures: How to prevent pet food recallsYour employees are key to building a safety quality culture and maintaining pet food compliance.News HoundTransparency tames social media rumors for pet food brandsBy maintaining open lines of communication and demonstrating accountability, pet food manufacturers can mitigate the impact of rumors and improve their ability to identify and resolve real issues before they escalate into larger crises.News HoundKeep watching the SKUs!

Symptoms and treatment in humans and pets ByAditi Srivastava Jan 28, 2024 09:29 AM IST Share Via Copy Link Avian influenza, is a respiratory disease caused by a specific type of flu virus. It primarily affects birds but can also infect humans. A shiver of fear has swept across California as a new threat has emerged: avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu. This highly contagious viral disease, primarily affecting birds, has triggered an outbreak of unprecedented scale, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. Poultry farms are under lockdown, wild birds are falling from the sky, and anxieties are skyrocketing. Is this danger only for birds, or should humans and their pets worry too? What exactly is this avian flu, and what are the potential risks and treatments? The avian flu season traditionally begins each October as migratory birds shed infected droppings or saliva while leaving cool areas of the Northern Hemisphere.(AP) Also read: Avian flu wreaks havoc in California, poultry industry takes an existential hit What is Avian flu outbreak in California?Bird flu, also referred to as avian influenza, is a respiratory condition that is usually brought on by infection with a specific type of influenza (flu) virus. These influenza viruses are frequently seen in domestic poultry, including guinea hens, ducks, geese, and chickens. Although there is little chance of human infection, incidences of avian flu viruses have been reported, especially in people who often interact with poultry or wild birds. How Avian Influenza spreads to humansHuman infections with the avian flu virus have caused illnesses ranging in severity from mild cases with no symptoms to fatal cases of severe disease. As per the CDC, “Asian lineage H7N9 and highly pathogenic avian influenza Asian lineage H5N1 viruses have been responsible for most human illness from bird flu viruses worldwide to date.” Also read: White House sounds alarm over explicit AI-generated Taylor Swift photos, ‘Congress should take..’ Infected birds typically release the bird flu virus through their saliva, mucus, and feces. Human exposure can occur when the virus is present in the air (in droplets or potentially dust), and a person inhales it. Additionally, there is a risk of infection if a person touches a surface contaminated with the virus and then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose. Symptoms of Avian Flu in humansNo symptoms or mild illness:Eye redness (conjunctivitis)Mild flu-like upper respiratory symptomsMild to severe symptoms:Fever (temperature of 100ºF [37.8ºC] or greater) or feeling feverishCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesHeadachesFatigueShortness of breath or difficulty breathingLess common symptoms:DiarrheaNauseaVomitingSeizuresAvian flu in petsCertain bird flu viruses have the ability to infect and transmit to other animals. There have been instances where these viruses have been known to occasionally affect mammals that consume (presumably infected) birds or poultry. Avian Flu prevention and treatmentsAs a precaution, isolate yourself at home from other family members if you suspect infection or develop symptoms within 10 days of your last interaction with infected birds. Refrain from going to work or school until a flu test confirms the absence of the avian flu virus, and you have fully recovered. It is crucial to act responsibly and promptly report your symptoms and any recent exposure to infected or unwell birds to a healthcare provider, particularly if the illness involves respiratory symptoms. You will receive guidance on whether to stay at home or be hospitalized in isolation from other patients. Depending on the situation, you may be prescribed antiviral medication.

The deadly virus, first detected on the continent in October 2023, has decimated bird and mammal populations in recent months. — A deadly type of avian flu has begun spreading among Antarctic penguins for the first time, just four months after the virus was first detected on the continent. According to Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research’s (SCAR) data, 14 out of 35 cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus among gentoo penguins have so far been confirmed via PCR test, though Reuters on Wednesday reported that the government of the Falkland Islands, a subantarctic region off the southern tip of Argentina, has identified “over 200 dead chicks alongside a handful of adults” and was awaiting test results from rockhopper penguins as it prepared “for a large-scale outbreak.” Support Independent Climate JournalismHelp us continue providing unbiased, in-depth coverage on climate change.

The Falkland Islands located on the globe. Image: Wikimedia Commons Vanstreels’ theory was challenged by two animal health groups, which in an update issued on December 22, 2023, warned of further avian flu spread in the Antarctica region and said there is a “moderate likelihood” that the virus will reach Oceania – the only region in the world yet to detect any cases of the H5N1 clade. Migratory birds are believed to be the main vector of the deadly strain of avian influenza – or bird flu – that has spread out rapidly across the northern hemisphere in the past two years. Since January 2022, over 11,400 bird outbreaks – defined as “an occurrence of one or more cases in a group of animals with a defined epidemiologic relationship” – were identified across 84 member countries of the World Organisation for Animal Health, with France reporting the highest number. In the US alone between January 2022 and December 27, 2023, the virus was detected in more than 8,500 wild birds in 50 states or territories and more than 1,000 commercial and backyard flocks, affecting nearly 80 million birds. Unfortunately, it is not just birds that have been subjected to this virus. This strain, dubbed a “spillover event,” has affected many mammals including otters, farmed foxes and minks, domesticated cats and dogs, and sea lions – with 300 outbreaks globally recorded between May 2022 and December 27, 2023, and even humans – with 19 sporadic cases reported from eight countries in the same timeframe, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 2022-2023 detections of highly pathogenic avian flu in mammals.

While the high mortality rate of avian influenza is hugely alarming, the new strain of H5N1 has been classified as “low risk” as the genetic modification it would require to move between humans is quite substantial. Reassuringly, H5N1 has been around since 1996 and this specific genetic mutation has not yet happened. Featured image: South Georgia, South Atlantic Ocean.

The presence of segmented filamentous bacteria, a commensal microbe present in some mice, reprograms AM gene expression, increasing complement expression and phagocytosis, thereby enabling AM to engulf and destroy viral pathogens without inflammatory signaling. [Dr. Andrew Gewirtz]A study by researchers at Georgia State University Institute for Biomedical Sciences has shown that the composition of gut microbiota can influence both the susceptibility of mice to respiratory virus infections (RVIs) and the severity of these infections. The research showed that segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), a common bacterial species found in the mouse intestines, protected animals against influenza virus infection, whether these bacteria were naturally acquired or administered. SFB-related protection against viral infection was also observed against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The collective study results indicated that to retain their protective capacity, the segmented filamentous bacteria required the presence of basally resident alveolar macrophage (AM) immune cells in the lungs. AMs are among the first cells to encounter inhaled threats including respiratory viruses. The team said that if the results are found to be applicable to human infections, they could have significant implications for risk assessing whether patients might advance to severe disease following infection. Andrew Gewirtz, PhD, Regents’ Professor at the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State, and Richard Plemper, PhD, Regents’ Professor and director of the Center for Translational Antiviral Research at Georgia State, are co-senior authors of the team’s published paper in Cell Host & Microbe, which is titled, “Intestinal microbiota programming of alveolar macrophages influences severity of respiratory viral infection,” in which they concluded, “These findings uncover complex interactions that mechanistically link the intestinal microbiota with AM functionality and RVI severity.” Andrew Gewirtz, PhD, co-senior author of the study and Regents’ Professor at the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State University. [Georgia State University]Susceptibility to respiratory virus infections such as RSV, SARS-Cov-2, and influenza A viruses (IAVs) varies widely between individuals, and can range from asymptomatic to lung pathology and potentially death, the authors wrote. And while the scientists pointed out that there are likely many different, and complex factors involved in determining these differing responses to respiratory virus infection, “…we hypothesized that one important factor is gut microbiota composition, which is now appreciated to have broad influence over a range of chronic inflammatory diseases and the immune responses with which such diseases are associated.” To investigate this further in mice, the team looked more closely at whether differences in particular microbial species can impact outcomes of respiratory virus infections, and if so, how they might do so, which hasn’t been well defined previously. The scientists first studied mice raised with discrete microbiome differences and then subsequently studied mice mice differing in only the presence or absence of segmented filamentous bacteria. Viral titers in the lung were measured several days after infection and varied significantly depending on the nature of the microbiome of the different animal groups. The study found that in animals lacking segmented filamentous bacteria, basally resident alveolar macrophages were quickly depleted as influenza virus A infection progressed. However, in mice colonized with segmented filamentous bacteria, basally resident alveolar macrophages were altered to resist influenza virus infection depletion and inflammatory signaling. The basally resident alveolar macrophages disabled influenza virus, in large part by activating a component of the immune system referred to as the complement system. “AMs from SFB-colonized mice were not quiescent. Rather, they directly disabled IAV via enhanced complement production and phagocytosis,” the scientists stated. “We show herein that how AMs respond to respiratory viruses is dramatically altered by the composition of the intestinal microbiota,” they further commented. “Specifically, we report that colonization of the intestine by SFB, naturally acquired or exogenously administered, markedly attenuates IAV-induced AM pro-inflammatory gene expression while increasing ability of AMs to disable IAV.” Transfer of SFB-transformed AMs into SFB-free hosts recapitulated SFB-mediated protection against IAV in these animals. The authors acknowledged establishment of the general concept that microbiota composition in total can influence immune phenotype and proneness to infection. However, Plemper commented, “We find it remarkable that the presence of a single common commensal bacterial species, amidst the thousands of different microbial species that inhabit the mouse gut, had such strong impacts in respiratory virus infection models and that such impacts were largely attributable to reprogramming of basally resident alveolar macrophages. If applicable to human infections, these findings will have major implications for the future risk assessment of a patient to advance to severe disease.” The authors further pointed out, “The extent to which SFB is present in humans is not well defined, but it has been reported to be frequently present in children in some regions and was unequivocally shown to be present in some adult individuals.” Richard Plemper, PhD, co-senior author of the study, Regents’ Professor, and director of the Center for Translational Antiviral Research at Georgia State University. [Georgia State University]The authors pointed out that independent of a specific role for SFB, the findings “speak strongly” to the potential of gut microbiota to influence proneness to RVI, especially via programming of AMs. “Both AM pro-inflammatory gene expression and AM depletion are known to correlate with RVI severity in humans, but determinants of inter-individual heterogeneity in AM responses have not been defined.” They reason that it is “highly unlikely that SFB is the only gut microbe capable of impacting on AMs and susceptibility to RVI. “Rather, we posit that AMs are a key component of the gut-lung axis, wherein an individual’s microbiota in its entirety is a determinant of disease outcome following exposure to an array of respiratory viruses.” Gewitz added, “We find it highly unlikely that segmented filamentous bacteria is the only gut microbe capable of impacting the phenotype of alveolar macrophages, and consequently, proneness to respiratory virus infection. Rather, we hypothesize that gut microbiota composition broadly influences proneness to respiratory virus infection. Microbiota mediated programming of basally resident alveolar macrophages may not only influence the severity of acute respiratory virus infection, but may also be a long-term post-respiratory virus infection health determinant.” The authors further pointed out that deciphering how SFB impacts on lung AMs could potentially point to strategies for reducing disease burden caused by RVI. So, as well as mitigating primary RVI, AM persistence may help prevent secondary consequences of RVI, they suggested. “Many of the severe consequences of IAV infection in humans result from secondary bacterial infections, to which the lung is more permissive by loss of IAV-induced AM depletion.” NewsAlveolar macrophagesBacteriaGut floraInfluenza virusMiceRespiratory diseasesSARS-CoV-2 Share FacebookTwitterLinkedinReddItEmail Previous articleBone Marrow Cells Renew Functional Bladder Tissue in Animal ModelNext articleGene Replacement Therapy Halts Fatal Arrhythmogenic Condition in Mice Sophia Ktori Also of Interest Gut Microbiome Changes May Serve as Risk Factors for Rheumatoid Arthritis Ketogenic Diet Shapes Gut Microbiota to Protect from Autoimmunity in Mice Wet AMD Treatments Could Work Better If Both VEGF and ANGPTL4 Are Targeted Improving the Manufacture of mRNA Biologics Leveraging Flow Cytometry to Accelerate Research Using Humanized Immune System Mice Cancer Biomarker Potential "Seen" in Extracellular Vesicles Related Media Dr. Fauci Reflects on His 54 Year Career at the NIH Shehnaaz Suliman, MD, MPhil, Discusses Targeted Respiratory Therapies on "Close to the Edge" The First Computer-Generated Bacterial Genome Type O Blood from Any-Type Donors Smartplants Bacterial Snow Formation Related Content Gut Microbiome Changes May Serve as Risk Factors for Rheumatoid Arthritis Ketogenic Diet Shapes Gut Microbiota to Protect from Autoimmunity in Mice Wet AMD Treatments Could Work Better If Both VEGF and ANGPTL4 Are Targeted Improving the Manufacture of mRNA Biologics Read the Digital Edition ExploreAbout GEN Contact GEN GEN Staff Editorial Guidelines Reprints and Permissions Scientific Advisory Board AdvertiseMedia Kit and Planning Calendar Advertising Terms and Conditions ResourcesGet the GEN Magazine Get the GEN Email Newsletter Inside Precision Medicine Privacy Policy Copyright © 2024 Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News.

There is a rise of flu cases in the state, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.The 2023-24 flu season began Oct. 1. As of a Dec. 8 state health department report, more than 4,700 positive flu cases had been collected since then, with a seasonal positivity rate of 6.59% as of now. There’s concern about COVID-19 and RSV cases. Here’s what to be on the lookout for:The flu has a higher surge this seasonAccording to local health experts, Austin and Travis County is experiencing a rise in airborne illnesses due to unmasking and not being up to date with flu shots. The flu A strain is harming adults while flu B can be damaging to children. There is a spike in these cases because of holiday travel, said Dr. Angela Gibson, director of urgent care services and after-hours clinics for family medicine at Austin Regional Clinic. What can people do to protect themselves from COVID-19, RSV and flu?While these respiratory illnesses have similar symptoms, the timing of when they hit your system is key. Here are some signs to pay attention to according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Influenza, commonly known as the flu, can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Flu symptoms usually come on suddenly. People infected with RSV usually show symptoms within four to six days after getting infected.People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported — ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms can appear two to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms. The CDC recommends staying up to date on all your vaccinations and, if you're sick, remaining at home. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with others, such as kissing, shaking hands or sharing cups and eating utensils.What allergens are in the air?So-called cedar fever causes allergic reactions in many Central Texans. The tree pollen that causes it typically peaks in January to early February.Cedar fever is not really cedar-related and doesn’t typically come with a fever. the allergy is triggered when the male Ashe juniper trees spread their pollen to the female Ashe juniper trees. It causes symptoms like stuffy nose, coughing and itchy eyes. Unlike most allergies that hit in spring, cedar fever occurs in the winter months.Here's a look at the cedar levels in Texas as of now: Facebook Twitter EmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices© Copyright Gannett 2024All about Avian Flu outbreak that is devastating farms in the US - India Today India TodayAaj TakGNTTVLallantopBusiness TodayBanglaMalayalamNortheastBT BazaarHarper's BazaarSports TakCrime TakAstro TakGamingBrides TodayCosmopolitanKisan TakIshq FMIndia Today HindiReader’s DigestAaj Tak CampusIndia TodayAaj TakGNTTVLallantopBusiness TodayBanglaMalayalamNortheastBT BazaarHarper's BazaarSports TakMagazineLive TVSearchSEARCHSIGN INEdition ININUSHome TVLive TVPrimetimeElectionsMaharashtraJharkhandMagazineLatest EditionInsightBest CollegesLife+StyleIndiaSouthWorldBusinessAll SportsSports TodayWT20 World CupCricketFootballTennisTechnologyEntertainmentShowbuzzBollywoodHollywoodOTTLatest ReviewsNewspresso SpecialsPodcastsFirst Things FastSunday SpecialHistory of ItNewsMoDIUInteractivesOpinionGamesVideosShort VideosFact Check Other NewsEducationIt's ViralScienceHealthAutoLaw TodayEnvironmentCitiesWeatherWeb StoriesHoroscopesDownload AppFollow Us On: NewsHealthAll about Avian Flu outbreak that is devastating farms in the US All about Avian Flu outbreak that is devastating farms in the USThe Avian Flu outbreak has led to the destruction of over 1 million birds in the region, causing significant economic damage to farmers, workers, and customers alike.Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementAvian flu or bird flu is caused by the influenza A virus.

In Sonoma County, a state of emergency has been declared following the infection of Mike Weber's Sunrise Farms, where 5,50,000 egg-laying hens had to be culled to prevent further spread of the disease. advertisementThis outbreak has led to the destruction of over 1 million birds in the region, causing significant economic damage to farmers, workers, and customers alike.WHAT IS AVIAN FLU? Avian flu or bird flu is caused by the influenza A virus which usually birds contract, but it can infect humans too.This highly contagious viral disease is seen in domestic poultry including guinea hens, ducks, geese, and chickens. People can get this virus if they come in contact with a sick bird. SYMPTOMS OF AVIAN FLUAvian flu presents various symptoms in birds, including diarrhoea, breathing difficulties, swollen heads, and sudden death. Avian flu or bird flu is caused by the influenza A virus which usually birds contract, but it can infect humans too. (Photo: Getty Images) In humans, the symptoms can range from mild, such as cough, headache, sore throat, and fever, to severe conditions like pneumonia requiring hospitalisation. Other human symptoms include shortness of breath, chills, fatigue, congestion, muscle aches, and in some cases, conjunctivitis.Transmission of Avian Flu to HumansThe transmission of avian flu to humans typically occurs through direct contact with infected birds, contaminated surfaces, or bird droppings. It is unlikely for the virus to spread to people from consuming undercooked eggs or poultry. However, people who handle infected birds or come into contact with their environments are at higher risk.Preventive MeasuresTo prevent the spread of avian flu, experts recommend several measures: Properly handle and cook poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 73.8°C to kill viruses. Practice good hygiene, especially when handling raw poultry. Use separate utensils for cooked and raw meat. Avoid contact with live birds and poultry. Implement biosecurity measures, such as restricting access to poultry farms and disinfecting clothing and equipment. Treatment for Avian FluWhile there is no specific treatment for avian flu in birds, infected flocks are euthanised to contain the virus. For humans, antiviral medications such as oseltamivir may be prescribed to treat the infection. It is crucial for individuals who suspect they have been exposed to avian flu to seek medical attention promptly.Published By: Daphne ClarancePublished On: Jan 29, 2024ALSO READ | Unmasking loneliness: The silent epidemic sweeping India and the worldMust Watch Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchBJP's 'divisive politics' will not work in Maharashtra: Aaditya ThackerayHera Pheri reunion!

If confirmed, it will be the first of the species killed by the highly contagious H5N1 virus in the wild.Researchers have previously raised alarm about “one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times” if bird flu reached remote Antarctic penguin populations. The birds are currently clustering together for breeding season, meaning the disease could rip through entire colonies if it continues to spread through the region.King penguins are the world’s second-largest penguin, at about 3ft tall, and can live for more than 20 years in the wild. The suspected case was recorded on South Georgia island in the sub-Antarctic region, according to the latest update from the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (Scar). A gentoo penguin was also suspected to have died from H5N1 at the same location. “One fatal outbreak in a gentoo colony has been recorded, with the virus confirmed in at least two dead birds”.Quick GuideWhat is bird flu?ShowWhat is H5N1, the deadly strain of bird flu sweeping the world?The current outbreak of bird flu started in Europe in 2021. By September 2022, H5N1 had been recorded in 63 wild bird species across 37 countries, according to an avian influenza overview published by the European Food Safety Authority. It hits seabirds particularly hard because they sit so close together during the breeding season: some colonies experience losses of 50% to 60%.Then it crossed the Atlantic, with the first US case recorded in an American wigeon duck found in South Carolina in January 2022. By November it had reached South America. More than 40% of all Peruvian pelicans died over a period of a few weeks in early 2023.Working out how many wild birds have died is difficult because so many carcasses are never found or counted. Researchers say it may be in the millions.Does it affect other species?The H5N1 virus has multiple genes that can switch and evolve together to spread the virus quickly into a wide range of species. The death of an estimated 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru shows that this is a disease that also kills mammals en masse. Black bears, brown bears and polar bears have also been killed.How did it reach the Antarctic, and what will happen next?The spread of this disease is facilitated by the migration routes of wild birds. It took just three months to spread almost 4,000 miles down South America, and it was seen as inevitable it would at some point reach the Antarctic.It was first reported in the region in October 2023 among brown skua on Bird Island, off South Georgia. Since then it has spread into elephant seals, fur seals and kelp gulls. Most recently, it has been recorded in Antarctic penguin populations too.So far there are no recorded cases on the Antarctic mainland, although researchers expect that to happen in the coming months. This latest H5N1 virus is yet to be reported in Oceania.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Separately, one fatal outbreak in a gentoo colony has been recorded, with the virus confirmed in at least two dead birds on the Falkland Islands – 900 miles (1,500km) west of South Georgia – with more than 20 chicks either dead or also showing symptoms. Since H5N1 arrived in the Antarctic, there have been mass deaths of elephant seals as well as increased deaths of fur seals, kelp gulls and brown skua in the region.View image in fullscreenA scientist testing seals for bird flu on the island of South Georgia. The virus has been found in elephant and fur seals in the Antarctic region. Photograph: Dr Marco Falchieri/Apha/PAPrevious outbreaks in South Africa, Chile and Argentina show penguins are susceptible to the disease. Since it arrived in South America, more than 500,000 seabirds have died of it, with penguins, pelicans and boobies among those most heavily affected.Ed Hutchinson, a molecular virologist at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, said: “The arrival of this H5N1 virus in the Antarctic towards the end of last year rang alarm bells because of the risk it posed to wildlife in this fragile ecosystem. And while it is very sad to hear reports of penguins dying … it is unfortunately not at all surprising.”Mass deaths of elephant seals recorded as bird flu sweeps across the AntarcticRead moreDiana Bell, emeritus professor of conservation biology at the University of East Anglia, said she had feared something like this would happen. “I’m just devastated, really – as will everybody who cares about penguins and the Antarctic … Given their colonial social organisation, you’d just wonder how quickly it would go through the colonies.”So far, there are no recorded cases on the Antarctic mainland, according to Scar mapping data, but this could be because there are so few people present to record possible fatalities. Avian flu adds to the pressures already faced in these pristine polar ecosystems – a study in 2018 warned that the climate crisis and overfishing meant Antarctica’s king penguins “could disappear” by the end of the century.The disease is also ripping through wildlife populations in the Arctic. In December, it was confirmed that for the first time a polar bear had died of H5N1.

Kate Wieser/Getty ImagesAs COVID, influenza, RSV, and the common cold increase this time of year, it can be hard to decipher which is which.Cold-like symptoms are common for viruses.Experts share over-the-counter remedies for cold-like symptoms and when it’s time to see a doctor.With an increase in hospitalizations associated with COVID-19, the flu, and RSV, people may experience lingering cold-like symptoms due to these illnesses.“All of these respiratory viruses present in a similar fashion. It can be very hard to differentiate between any of them without testing. They can all be mistaken for one another; they can all be mistaken for the common cold,” Dr. Linda Yancey, infectious diseases specialist at Memorial Hermann Hospital, told Healthline.Because COVID-19, the common cold, and the flu have many similar symptoms, like runny noses, sore throats, coughs, fatigue, and muscle aches, Dr. Jay W. Lee, a member of the board of directors of the American Academy of Family Physicians, reiterated that it is common for people to confuse them.Lee explained some differences between each illness:Cold symptoms are generally milder than the flu and can develop slowly.Flu symptoms are typically more severe but include similar symptoms in addition to chills, sweat, and a fever.RSV may cause runny nose, cough, sneezing, reduced appetite, and, in young kids, irritability, lack of energy, and difficulty breathing.Loss of taste or smell are unique and more common with COVID-19.Unlike RSV and colds, the flu and COVID-19 may also bring on some gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.How long do cold-like symptoms last?Cold symptoms typically take one to three days to develop and can last up to 10 days.“I know it’s not ideal, but your body is working to fight off infection,” Lee told Healthline. “If you find yourself not getting enough rest or staying hydrated, cold symptoms can linger longer. Your body needs an ample amount of rest and fluids to fight off a cold or other infection.”Congestion and coughing can often persist once other symptoms like sore throat and runny nose have cleared up, added Yancey.If your symptoms last longer than two weeks, it’s time to see your doctor, who can diagnose your illness and determine whether there’s an underlying issue or if treatment is needed.“If a fever is persistent and greater than 102 or not responding to fever reducers, or a cough progresses to trouble breathing, make an appointment with your family doctor,” said Lee.He noted that people with chronic health conditions may find themselves more vulnerable to complications from colds and should talk with their doctor as soon as symptoms start or if they know they have been exposed to an illness.“We know it can be difficult to differentiate between a cold and other similar illnesses, but patients should monitor their symptoms and talk to their family doctor if they’re concerned or have questions,” said Lee.Why antibiotics don’t work on viruses like the common cold, flu, and RSVAntibiotics help to fight infections that are caused by bacteria (not viruses), such as strep throat, whooping cough, and urinary tract infections, by killing the bacteria or making it hard for it to grow and multiply, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Taking antibiotics for viral infections such as a cold or the flu does not make the infection go away, keep it from spreading, or make a person feel better.In fact, taking antibiotics for viruses can have the opposite effect on your health because taking antibiotics when they are not needed puts you at risk of getting a bacterial infection that is resistant to antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic resistance is one of the most urgent threats to the public’s health, according to the CDC.Treatments for flu, COVID-19, and RSVIn some cases, doctors may use the following treatments for each condition.FluIf given during the first few days that flu symptoms arise, antiviral treatment can help keep the symptoms from getting worse and shorten the time a person is sick with the flu. Common antiviral medications used for the flu include:oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu)zanamivir (Relenza)peramivir (Rapivab)baloxavir marboxil (Xoflu)COVID-19Depending on a person’s age, their medical history, and when they began having COVID-19 symptoms, they may be prescribed the following antiviral medications:nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (Paxlovid)remdesivir (Veklury)molnupiravir (Lagevrio)RSVBecause most RSV infections reside after a week or two, doctors don’t usually use antiviral medication. However, sometimes a person might need to be hospitalized due to breathing difficulties or being dehydrated.In these cases, oxygen, IV fluids or a breathing tube may be needed.Over-the-counter products that can help treat cold-like symptomsPseudoephedrine is a powerful decongestant that can help people feel better, according to Yancey.“It does not require a prescription but in many states, it is behind the counter. You have to ask for it at the pharmacy and they will have you sign for it,” she said.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can help manage the pain of a sore throat and headache, as well as reduce fever, said Yancey.For a sore throat, other over-the-counter remedies include throat sprays or lozenges, and to loosen mucus and moisten the tender skin inside your nose, Lee suggested saline nose drops. He recommended the following ways to ease cold, flu, and COVID-19 symptoms at home:Gargling with warm salt water a few times a day to help a sore throat feel betterDrinking plenty of fluids like water and clear soupsAvoiding caffeine and alcoholResting at home, especially while you have a fever“Don’t forget during the colder months, it’s especially important for patients to take precautions like washing their hands, staying away from others who are sick, staying home when ill, and getting vaccinated against the flu, COVID-19, and RSV, if eligible,” said Lee.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Cathy Cassata on February 1, 2024 — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJMore in Focus on RSV, Flu, and the Common ColdWhat to Know About Bronchiolitis vs. RSVUnderstanding the Similarities and Differences Between Rhinovirus and RSVExploring the Connections Between RSV and AsthmaWhat to know about Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) TestsView allRead this nextWhat to Know About RSV and PregnancyRSV is a common respiratory virus.

Opens in a new tab or window email article By Brett Moskowitz, MAReviewed by Joseph Yabes, MD In addition to older age, comorbidities are an important risk factor for hospitalization for adult patients who acquire respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). According to a newly published modelling study on RSV-associated hospitalization in adults with comorbidities, chronic respiratory and heart diseases, as well as diabetes, are among the comorbidities that have been shown in previous epidemiologic studies to be prevalent in patients hospitalized with RSV.1-4 In addition, chronic kidney diseases and cardiovascular diseases have been linked with RSV-associated severe illness and death.5-7 The Bottom LineIn this study, 7 different comorbidities were examined (asthma, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and stroke).The researchers concluded that individuals with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe RSV infection, with those with COPD, IHD, asthma, or CKD at higher risk."The findings of this study provide important evidence for identifying risk groups and assisting health authorities in RSV vaccination policymaking." -- Osei-Yeboah et al., Journal of Infectious Diseases, 2023In 2023, 2 RSV vaccines were approved for use in Europe by the European Medicines Agency,8,9 creating an opportunity to reduce the risk for RSV through vaccinations. However, according to the authors of a recent study, not enough is known about the impact of geographical diversity and the type of comorbidity on the risk of RSV-associated acute respiratory illness hospitalization, especially in Europe.10 This study, from Richard Osei-Yeboah, PhD, from the Centre for Global Health at the Usher Institute, and research fellow at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, and colleagues, researched RSV-related hospitalizations, with the goal of providing data to assist healthcare authorities in establishing applicable vaccination guidelines.10 The investigators in this retrospective study wanted to determine the number, rates, and risk of RSV-associated hospitalizations among Danish and Scottish adults aged 45 years and older who had at least 1 of 7 comorbidities (asthma, chronic kidney disease [CKD], chronic liver disease [CLD], chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder [COPD], diabetes, ischemic heart disease [IHD], and stroke) and were diagnosed with RSV during the pre-COVID-19 era (2010-2018). A regression modelling approach was used to select patients based on influenza vaccination recommendations and available data from national hospital registries and virological surveillance. There were separate models for each comorbidity in each country. In addition, the investigators performed subanalyses by age group (45-54 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, 75-84 years, and 85y+ years). Comparing adults with comorbidities to the overall population, the investigators estimated rate ratios (RRs) of RSV-associated hospitalization and 95% uncertainty ranges.10 Significant differences in annual RSV-respiratory tract infection (RTI) hospitalization rates existed based on the comorbidity involved. In the Danish cohort, rates ranged from 3.1 per 1000 adults with asthma up to 19.4 per 1000 among adults with CKD. In the Scottish cohort, those with CLD had an annual RSV-RTI hospitalization rate of 2.4 per 1000 compared to 9.0 per 1000 among adults with COPD. COPD, IHD, stroke, and diabetes all raised the risk of RSV hospitalization 2-4-fold in both Danish and Scottish cohorts. The risk was increased 1.5-3-fold in adults with asthma, and 3-7-fold for those with CKD. For patients aged 45-64 years with COPD, asthma, IHD or CKD, RSV hospitalization rates were higher compared with the overall population.10 Hospitalizations rates in both Scotland and Denmark rose significantly when looking at those in their 60s, 70s, and 80s, peaking in those 85 years and older. For those with COPD and asthma, these hospitalization rates rose even more dramatically. When comparing those 75 years and older to younger individuals, a 6-fold increase in hospitalization rates was observed in those with COPD and asthma. These increases in hospitalization rates for older patients were not as great when looking at other comorbidities.10 Several limitations and challenges existed in this study. First, the authors noted a difficulty with obtaining accurate data on comorbidities. They stated that some of the study population may have been at early stages of disease progression before RSV-related hospitalization. Therefore, some comorbidities may not have been captured. In addition, some assumptions were made with respect to RSV and influenza data. Finally, the researchers were not able to provide age-specific estimates for Scottish adults with CLD or Danish adults with CKD, due to lack of data. Overall, though, the researchers concluded that individuals with comorbidities are at increased risk of severe RSV infection. “Our results show that adults aged 65y+ with these comorbidities, and adults aged 45-64y with COPD, IHD, asthma, or CKD remain a high priority population to consider for RSV immunisation when RSV vaccines become available for use in adult population,” the study authors write. “The findings of this study provide important evidence for identifying risk groups and assisting health authorities in RSV vaccination policymaking.” Published: February 01, 2024 Brett Moskowitz, MA, writes about medicine and, in 2008, founded Bowery Consulting which specializes in the development of medical content for healthcare professionals.

Several dozen geese have died or fallen ill in Kingston, Ont., in recent days, and one expert says avian influenza is a prime suspect. (Dan Taekema/CBC)Social SharingA wildlife expert says it's likely an outbreak of avian influenza killed about 30 Canada geese in Kingston, Ont. this week.In a news release issued Friday, the city said it investigated "deceased and distressed Canada geese" found recently in Lake Ontario Park, just west of Kingston's downtown."Staff observed signs of sickness and the presence of approximately 30 dead birds," according to the release.Reports started coming in several days ago about dead geese, according to Paulanne Peters, a volunteer with Sandy Pines Wildlife Centre. Within the last two days, however, the number of dead geese has grown, Peters said."This has come on so quickly," she said. "In the past two days so far, we've only seen geese [affected]. We're hoping this is a very isolated incident."Canada geese gather at Lake Ontario Park in Kingston on Friday. About 30 geese have been reported to have died over the past few days. (Dan Taekema/CBC)Peters has been bringing the geese back to the centre where they're treated, but she says many have died in their care."It's difficult, because we know that when they go into Sandy Pines, they're not coming out," she said."There's lots of happy stories with Sandy Pines, for sure, but this is just one of those occasions where, you know, we're just trying to stop the suffering as quickly as possible."Test results within 2 weeks, says pathologistWhile the illness hasn't yet been confirmed, wildlife pathologist Brian Stevens says it's quite probable the birds were infected with avian influenza. "It's a high likelihood," said Stevens, who works for the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, which has been testing samples for Environment and Climate Change Canada. "Since we've had this highly pathogenic form of avian influenza here in North America, this is the typical event that we see." Avian flu found at western Quebec commercial poultry farm There are clear warning signs, he said, when spotting sick birds."They'll have symptoms consistent with neurological signs," he said. "Sometimes they will have seizures, sometimes they'll be stumbling to walk, shaking their head and just seem a little bit off."Stevens said he expects test results back within two weeks.He also warned that avian influenza can spread easily among birds and can be particularly concerning for poultry farms."If you do have poultry, make sure you have strong biosecurity because the virus ... can be extremely dangerous and cause mass mortality."Peters says the outbreak happened quickly, and that many of the infected geese have died in their care. (Dan Taekema/CBC)Be careful, city urgesWhile there are "rare occasions" of humans falling sick from avian influenza, the disease isn't a significant public health concern for healthy people who aren't in regular contact with infected birds, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.For birds that are ill, there's no treatment, the agency said.The City of Kingston is recommending anyone who comes across a sick or dead bird to report it to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative or the Sandy Pines Wildlife Centre.The city is asking residents not to handle sick, injured or dead birds, but if it's necessary, people should cover their hands with gloves or double plastic bags. They should avoid touching the bird's bodily fluids and wash thoroughly afterward, the city said.Pet owners are also being asked to keep their cats indoors and their dogs leashed.ABOUT THE AUTHORSam KonnertReporterSam Konnert is a reporter with CBC News in Ottawa.

Latest NHS figures show 2,226 beds were taken up by flu patients each day last week, up 70% in a month.But the number in hospital with Covid dipped slightly, and surveillance from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) showed rates were "broadly stable". The NHS said the data showed it was still "in the thick of a challenging winter"."Last week was evidence of why the NHS needed to grow its core bed numbers," said Prof Julian Redhead, NHS England's clinical director for urgent and emergency care. The NHS said this month that it had met its target to increase the number of core hospital beds in England by 5,000 to 99,864. But the latest data shows 96% of adult beds were still full last week, above the 85% level seen as safe by the World Health Organization. NHS performance figures also showed that 34% of hospital patients in England arriving by ambulance in the week to 18 January had to wait more than 30 minutes to be handed over to A&E doctors.That was up from 32% in the previous week, and the joint highest rate so far this winter.It comes as a number of hospitals, including Shrewsbury, Winchester and Stoke have declared critical incidents recently because of "sustained pressure" on services, allowing them to request assistance from neighbouring NHS trusts.

Eg âB1 1RFâ Last updated: Thursday 14 March About the data About the data Data for England is shown by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. Data for Wales and Scotland is shown by Health Board and in Northern Ireland by Health and Social Care Trust. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board and by Health and Social Care trust in Northern Ireland. Comparative data is shown for a previous year where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Earlier data is not available for all measures, so comparisons between years are not always possible. In England and Northern Ireland A&E attendances include all emergency departments in that trust or health board, not just major A&E departments. For example, those who attend minor injury units are included. In Wales the data include all emergency departments, but does not include patients kept in A&E by doctors under special circumstances, [more details here](https://www.bbc.co.ukews/uk-wales-67056279). In Scotland the data includes only major A&E departments. Each nation has different target times and definitions for some of the measures shown, therefore comparisons between them are not possible.

Flu and norovirus surgeThe latest figures show the winter flu season appears to have come later this year with the number needing hospital treatment continuing to rise.Common symptoms in adults include a sudden high temperature, aches, a dry cough and a sore throat. Some people also feel sick and report diarrhoea or stomach pain. The symptoms are similar in children, but they can also suffer from ear pain and appear less active.An average of 2,226 patients were in hospital each day last week with flu, including 84 in critical care beds, according to NHS England.The total is up 41% from 1,582 the previous week and up 70% from the start of the year.The NHS is urging those eligible for a free flu jab this winter,, external including all those over 65 years old, to continue to come forward. Another 688 hospital beds in England were filled last week by people with norovirus-like symptoms such as diarrhoea and sickness.The virus - known as the winter vomiting bug - spreads easily through contaminated surfaces or contact with an infected person. Covid hospitalisations dip slightlyThe number of people in hospital with Covid in England declined slightly, with an average of 3,701 beds occupied over the past week in large NHS trusts.Of that number, just over a quarter - or 1,013 - were being treated "primarily" for the virus, with the majority admitted to hospital for another health problem.A separate study from researchers at UKSHA, external suggested that the number of people testing positive for Covid in the community as a whole remained steady in the two weeks to 24 January.

News What’s Going Around: Flu, strep throat, pink eye by: Ali Lanyon Posted: Feb 1, 2024 / 04:19 AM EST Updated: Feb 1, 2024 / 05:07 AM EST by: Ali Lanyon Posted: Feb 1, 2024 / 04:19 AM EST Updated: Feb 1, 2024 / 05:07 AM EST SHARE The providers at UPMC Children’s Community Pediatrics in York and Spring Grove are seeing strep throat and flu this week. This week, pediatricians at Penn State Health Children’s Hospital are seeing a lot of the flu. They are also seeing cases of COVID and some RSV, as well as stomach bugs, colds and upper respiratory infections. Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health Physicians Roseville Pediatrics saw a lot of flu this week. They also saw a lot of fevers with flu-like symptoms and a high number of strep throat cases. There was an increase in various viral-related rashes, in addition to pink eye. Dr. Joan Thode offered the following advice about pink eye: “Conjunctivitis is the general term for inflammation of the outer clear layer of the surface of the eye. Crusting on the lashes or even some mucous in the eye does not mean an eye infection. Conjunctivitis causes the white part of the eyeballs to appear pink due to the dilation of the many tiny blood vessels. Some call this “bloodshot eyes,” but no matter how you describe the appearance of the eye, if the white parts are still white, the child does not have “pink eye.” Clear eyeballs and crusting on the lashes or some mucous at the inner corners of the eyes is often seen in infants and toddlers, though sometimes in older kids as well, in the context of a cold that causes the lining of the nose and sinuses to swell and impede the natural drainage pathway of the lubrication tears of the eyes. If the eyeballs are in fact pink or red, there can be a few causes: Bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently in only one eye and typically has thicker eye discharge. It can be painful or have a scratchy sensation when the child blinks. In babies, bacterial pink eye can frequently affect both eyes at the same time and should be evaluated for possible tear duct blockage. Bacterial pink eye is treated with eye drops by your child’s primary physician. Until treated, it is very contagious. Viral conjunctivitis frequently is seen in both eyes symmetrically. The discharge tends to be a bit thinner and waterier, though kids will frequently have crusting on their lashes after a period of sleep. Viral conjunctivitis is often seen in the second half of a virus and caused by the child rubbing their nose, then rubbing their eye, thus transferring the virus to the surface of the eye. Viral conjunctivitis will be killed off by the immune system at the same time it beats the virus elsewhere in the body. Antibiotic eye drops will not do anything to speed that process because they do not affect viruses. Unfortunately, viral conjunctivitis is also contagious by touch. Allergic conjunctivitis is a reaction to the pollen or other allergens in the air. This causes the immune cells to release histamine, which makes the eyes red, itchy, and watery. Itchy eyes are most likely allergic conjunctivitis. There is rarely thick eye drainage, though it is common for the eyes to tear a lot. The appropriate eye drops are anti-histamine rather than antibiotic, and these can be prescribed by your child’s primary physician. Reasons to see the doctor regardless of eye redness, but especially if there is conjunctivitis: thick drainage from the eye; pain with eye movement; eyelid swelling; pain with light/light sensitivity; symptoms that worsen over two to three days; eye redness with any recent eye trauma or suspected foreign body in the eye; changes in vision If you wipe away eye crust in the morning, revealing clear white eyeballs and none of the above listed symptoms, your kiddo is good to go about their normal day.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Email Facebook LinkedIn Twitter WhatsApp Reddit A worker moves crates of eggs at the Sunrise Farms processing plant in Petaluma, Calif., on Thursday, Jan. 11, 2024, which has seen an outbreak of avian flu in recent weeks. (AP Photo/Terry Chea) Since the latest bout of avian flu was first detected in a commercial poultry flock two years ago, nearly 82 million chickens, ducks and turkeys have been killed to limit the spread of the virus. That’s because whole flocks or slaughterhouse lots are killed when a single diseased bird is found, says Northeastern food policy safety expert Darin Detwiler. Within the last few weeks, a farm in California had to euthanize its 550,000 egg-laying hens when chickens tested positive for the avian flu, as reported by the Guardian and other news sources. Detwiler says he expects commercial flocks will remain at risk since the rising demand for poultry and the rise of industrial poultry farms create conditions conducive to the spread of avian influenza, a highly pathogenic disease. “It created this perfect storm,” says Detwiler, an associate teaching professor of food policy. “It’s just Russian roulette with a larger bull’s eye.” Darin Detwiler, associate teaching professor, is a national expert on food safety policy. He says the increased demand for poultry and growth of big farms creates conditions ripe for avian flu. Photo by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University Avian flu is not new — but huge farms are Avian flu, a specific strain of influenza adapted to birds, “is nothing new,” Detwiler says, adding that outbreaks between the 1950s and 1980s tended to be smaller and sporadic. Times have changed, and “what we have to realize is that the poultry population has grown,” Detwiler says. “The poultry population as a consumer food really grew in the 1990s. Therefore, bird populations grew radically and operations have become larger and larger.” He says 51 million poultry farm birds had to be “de-populated,” using the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s terminology, during the last big avian flu outbreak in 2014-15. The latest outbreak was detected by the USDA in a commercial poultry flock on Feb. 8, 2022.

RFK Jr says he wants to get rid of fluoride in water. What would that mean for our health? Since then, the USDA says, the virus has struck 1,084 commercial and backyard flocks in 47 states and led to the euthanization of nearly 81.74 million birds, mainly egg-laying chickens, broilers, turkeys and ducks. Inspection and slaughter One way USDA inspectors detect avian flu in poultry birds is to examine them just before slaughter for disease symptoms, including swelling, purple discoloration, paralysis or sickness, Detwiler says. The detection of one sick chicken results in the entire lot of chickens being slaughtered and buried or burned according to USDA regulations, Detwiler says. Chickens back on the farm where the sick one originated are also killed, he says. “In a large lot of chickens, if any one of them is found to show the symptoms of bird flu, they depopulate the entire flock.” “That’s pretty much the only way you can control the disease,” Detwiler says. “We’re talking about exposure, contamination, transmission of disease and control of the flock. “It’s not like the flu is getting worse,” he says. It’s just that the size and scope of poultry farming is growing so large that bigger and bigger flocks of birds are killed when infections are detected, Detwiler says. As farms grow, so does controversy The Business Research Company predicts that the demand for poultry will grow 6.9% from 2023 to 2024, due in part to people’s interest in healthy protein and to rising disposable incomes. Massive poultry farms are opening to meet rising demand, with big poultry now raising “more than a billion birds annually … in densely packed barns” in North Carolina, according to the Charlotte Observer. The growth of massive poultry operations has resulted in complaints by neighbors, environmentalists and even poultry farmers, most of whom contract with multi-billion dollar companies including Tyson Foods and Perdue Farms, “which control almost all aspects of production,” the Observer reported. Not a food-borne illness Sporadic cases of avian flu have occurred among people who handle birds, although there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The National Chicken Council says avian flu is not a food-borne illness, although people are encouraged to eat only properly cooked and handled poultry. The USDA says, “All poultry products for public consumption are inspected for signs of disease both before and after slaughter. The ‘inspected for wholesomeness by the U.S. Department of Agriculture seal ensures the poultry is free from visible signs of disease.’” Raw chicken is a culprit in salmonella but it could possibly pose a risk for avian flu as well, Detwiler says. He says the preemptive killing of “millions and millions” of birds shows that federal inspectors consider the risk of avian flu must be taken seriously. Professor tells the ‘dirty truth’ about food in Netflix documentary Vaccines — for chickens? Poultry farmers already are taking numerous steps to combat disease transmission, including having workers don hazmat-style suits, Detwiler says. Poultry companies are looking at other ways to minimize the costs associated with flock eradication due to disease detection, including using hormones to grow larger chicken breasts and growing poultry cells in the lab, he says. “I believe there’s work underway to find some kind of vaccine (for avian flu),” he says. “Then the goal would be to vaccinate chickens so that (flock eradication) doesn’t happen at all,” Detwiler says. “As of yet, it hasn’t happened.” In the meantime, the USDA says cooking eggs and poultry to the proper temperature, preventing cross-contamination, sanitizing cutting boards and washing hands with warm soap and water for at least 20 minutes after handling raw poultry and eggs will provide “protection against all avian influenza viruses” as well as salmonella and E. coli.

Read our privacy policyIt can be easy to conflate the common cold with the more serious flu when we're hiding under a duvet feeling worse for wear. But how can we actually tell the difference between the two?While a cold and the flu share several symptoms, there are clear ways of differentiating between them - and this can be vital when deciding how to treat your illness. From prevention to treatment, here’s everything you need to know about distinguishing between the prevalent winter illnesses:Symptoms: ColdBoth the cold and the flu are respiratory illnesses with very similar symptoms. However, these symptoms can be less severe if you’re suffering from the cold.“The common cold and flu are different conditions, but often share some of the same symptoms in the early stages, such as a headache, runny nose, or a sore throat,” says Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners.The first sign of a cold can appear in the form of a sore throat, the NHS says. This will typically be accompanied by a runny nose and slight congestion of the sinuses. You may then develop a cough after a few days, with children more likely to also experience a fever.While it isn’t pleasant to experience symptoms of a cold, you may still feel as though you’re well enough to carry on with normal everyday activities such as going to work. Symptoms: FluThe symptoms of the flu run pretty much along the same lines as the cold, although they may be more acute and materialise rapidly. “The difference is that flu is potentially much more serious, particularly for children and the elderly, and tends to leave people feeling unwell for much longer, sometimes taking a week or two to fully recover,” Professor Stokes-Lampard explains.Additional symptoms that people may experience when suffering from the flu include a fever, headaches, achy muscles, an upset stomach and nausea. If you’re experiencing the flu, then you’re far more likely to feel overly fatigued and unable to continue with your everyday routine as usual.Prevention: Coldopen image in galleryThe NHS recommends that you wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly (Getty Images)Colds spread extremely easily, especially when you spend a lot of time in close proximity with other people. This can be particularly relevant if you work in an open-plan office or if you take public transport to work. Germs that are spread from coughs or sneezes can survive for up to 24 hours, which is why taking some simple precautionary measures could do you and those around you a whole lot of good.The NHS recommends that you wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly and avoid sharing items such as towels or cups with people who may be infected.If you’re in the early stages of a cold, make sure you use tissues when you cough or sneeze and then discard them in a bin as soon as possible. Also wash your hands regularly to avoid spreading the germs. Prevention: FluTo safeguard yourself from the flu, Vicks advises that you boost your immune system by sticking to a regular bedtime and keeping yourself fit and healthy.Due to the unpredictable nature of the flu, having the flu jab is also a wise course of action if you’re more vulnerable to the illness than others. Those who are deemed as being high-risk, including people who are over 65, pregnant or have a serious health condition, are eligible for a free flu vaccine through the NHS.The flu jab will provide you with greater protection from the various strains of the flu that spread on an annual basis. Longevity: Coldopen image in galleryOne of the symptoms of a cold is a high temperature (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Symptoms of a cold such as a high temperature and fatigue don’t usually last longer than seven to 10 days in adults and older children, the NHS explains.For children under the age of five, colds can last for up to 10 to 14 days.While you may start to feel better a week or so after contracting a cold, you may still experience coughing and a buildup of mucus for around two to three weeks.As long as you have any symptoms of a cold, whether it’s the slightest cough or occasional sneeze, you will still pose the risk of infecting others with the virus. Longevity: FluIf you have the flu, your symptoms may start to abate after a week, although the NHS states that you might still feel weakened for a longer period of time. While you may make a full recovery in the space of a week or two, catching the flu could lead to a variety of other health problems if you’re particularly susceptible to infection.Consequences: ColdThe common cold does not usually lead to other serious health conditions. However, symptoms of a bacterial infection can sometimes be mistaken for those of a cold, in which case you could be at risk of further illness.These bacterial infections include conditions such as bronchitis and sinusitis.Consequences: FluThose who are classified as being high-risk may find themselves more prone to developing severe illnesses following a bout of flu. While it is unlikely that a cold will manifest into pneumonia, bacterial infections or hospitalisation, this is a greater possibility for people with the flu than those suffering from a cold, as explained by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Treatment: Coldopen image in galleryYou can buy over-the-counter cough or cold medicines or pain relief from your local pharmacy to ease your symptoms (Getty Images)If you catch a cold, you’ll ordinarily be capable of treating yourself with a few simple measures. “While the common cold and the flu can be very unpleasant, they are unfortunately the result of viruses, which means they have no cure and patients are usually better off treating them at home with simple self-care remedies,” Professor Stokes-Lampard outlines.The NHS has advised that anyone with a cold has plenty of rest, keeps themselves warm and drinks lots of fluids to avoid dehydration. You can also buy over-the-counter cough or cold medicines or pain relief from your local pharmacy to ease your symptoms and ensure your comfort. If you have a cough, drinking hot lemon with honey can have the same effect at soothing your throat as cough medicines, the NHS states.Treatment: FluAs with the cold, flu symptoms can often be treated from home by having lots of rest and taking medicine such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower your temperature.According to the NHS, GPs won’t recommend you take antibiotics for flu as contrary to popular belief, they don’t speed up your recovery."Antibiotics are medicines used to treat infections caused by bacteria. Antibiotics don't work against infections caused by viruses, such as colds and flu," writes the Health Service Executive of Ireland."So there's no point taking antibiotics to treat a cold or flu, and no point asking your doctor to prescribe them for a cold or flu."Your local pharmacist can provide you with any additional advice on flu treatment should you need it.If you're suffering from the flu, Professor Stokes-Lampard advises taking some time to consider whether or not you need to visit a doctor or can be treated from home.“We encourage patients who are ill to think hard about whether they do need to see a GP – not just in terms of reducing pressures on the NHS, but to minimise the possibility of passing viruses, such as flu, to other people, particularly in at-risk groups, such as those with long-term conditions or pregnant women," the professor says.If your flu symptoms don’t improve after seven days, then the NHS recommends arranging an appointment with your GP.More aboutFluColdCommon coldIllnessWinterJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesCommentsMost PopularPopular videosSponsored FeaturesGet in touchContact usOur ProductsSubscribeRegisterNewslettersToday’s EditionInstall our appArchiveOther publicationsInternational editionsIndependent en EspañolIndependent ArabiaIndependent TurkishIndependent PersianIndependent UrduThe StandardExtrasAdvisorPuzzlesAll topicsBetting OffersVoucher codesCompetitions and offersIndependent AdvertisingIndependent IgniteSyndicationWorking at The IndependentLegalCode of conduct and complaintsContributorsCookie policyPrivacy policyUser policiesModern Slavery StatementThank you for registeringPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged inPair of Wildlife Diseases Detected in Montana Birds Front PageAll StoriesAboutSubmissions & AdvertisingStaff & BoardRipple EffectAnnual ReportSupport UsContactAbout MojoStaff & BoardRipple EffectsArticle Submissions & AdvertisingAnnual Report Back to StoriesNEWS: In ShortFebruary 2, 2024Pair of Wildlife Diseases Detected in Montana BirdsRecent avian flu and pigeon paramyxovirus detections prompt FWP to issue statementby Julia BartonSupport UsGet NewsletterEurasian collared doves and mourning doves, like this pictured here incubating eggs, are susceptible to the disease pigeon paramyxovirus, or PPMV, which killed as many as 70 wild doves near Belgrade, Montana, in the last two months of 2023. Photo by Evan Davis/NPSby Julia Barton Multiple groups of up to 70 wild doves were found dead near Belgrade, Montana, in the final two months of 2023. The culprit: pigeon paramyxovirus, often referred to as PPMV. It’s one of two avian diseases recently recorded in the state, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. FWP responded to reports by residents where groups of doves were found dead, and disease testing revealed positive results for PPMV, FWP’s Morgan Jacobsen told Mountain Journal. PPMV typically impacts doves and pigeons alone, and the strain detected in Montana rarely infects mammals, according to a January 8 FWP press release. Additionally, there have been no recorded cases of the strain causing diseases in U.S. poultry. “Monitoring these diseases helps keep track of prevalence and distribution,” Jacobsen said, explaining that FWP monitors for a variety of wildlife diseases year round, including chronic wasting disease in ungulates. “[Monitoring] can help us better understand how wildlife can be affected over time and space.” The other avian disease found in the state since 2022—highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI—is extremely infectious and fatal to poultry and some species of wild birds. Although cases are currently low in Montana, the spread is cyclical and often spikes during spring and fall migration, Jacobsen explained. While cases in Montana are currently low, avian influenza, or HPAI—is highly infectious and fatal to poultry and some species of wild birds. “With avian flu, there are fairly broad impacts because it affects multiple species,” Jacobsen said. “In terms of population-level impacts, I think the long-term prognosis is unclear. We haven’t seen any significant die-offs, but that’s something that we’re watching closely when we get these surges of cases.” Among the impacted species are various iconic wild birds of the region, including the bald eagle, great horned owl, great blue heron and trumpeter swan. Three grizzly bears, a handful of skunks and a single mountain lion are among the mammals that have been infected in the state with HPAI since it was first documented in 2022, according to a Dec. 11 FWP dataset. The diseases are not isolated to Montana and many other U.S. states are experiencing the spread of both HPAI and PPMV. Jacobsen said Montana is “in the loop” with monitoring and research efforts occurring in other areas of the country to help guide state action. The risk of transmission to humans for both diseases is low, however FWP recommends taking precautions when handling birds that may appear to be sick or have already died. Hunters are advised to avoid harvesting birds that appear ill in order to avoid unnecessary risk. “If a bird has trouble moving, that's an indicator that the bird may be sick or injured,” Jacobsen said, noting that lack of mobility and lethargy are the telltale signs of illness. While transmission probability to pets is low, Jacobsen said owners can protect their pets by limiting their exposure to both wild birds and domestic poultry. State officials will determine where disease testing is warranted to continue monitoring the spread of HPAI and PPMV. Jacobsen encouraged Montanans to call their local FWP office if they come across sick or dead birds, and to notify the Montana Department of Livestock at (406) 444-2976 if they suspect an outbreak of HPAI in domestic animals or poultry.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Mountain Journal is the only nonprofit, public-interest journalism organization of its kind dedicated to covering the wildlife and wild lands of Greater Yellowstone.

Photo: iStockHimanshu NitnawarePublished on: 30 Jan 2024, 10:09 amCopiedWeeks after scientists suspected and confirmed deaths of elephant and fur seals due to bird flu in the British Overseas Territory (BOT) of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands near Antarctica, there are now reports of at least three penguin deaths from the region.A King penguin death was recorded on South Georgia island, according to the latest update from the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR). A gentoo penguin was also suspected to have died from H5N1 at the same location.Another gentoo penguin is confirmed to have died of bird flu on Sea Lion island in the Falklands, another BOT near South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.The death of the gentoo penguin in the Falklands was reported on January 19, while the king penguin death in South Georgia was reported on January 10.Over 20 penguin chicks are reportedly dead or showing symptoms of the disease, according to SCAR.Avian Influenza is a highly contagious viral disease which has swept populations of birds and mammals across the world. Since 2021, its variant known as HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has been dominated and caused outbreaks, leading to the deaths of millions of birds in the United Kingdom, South America, Europe and South Africa.In October 2023, bird flu arrived in the sub-Antarctic region after travelling from South America through sea birds. It infected elephant and fur seals, brown skua and kelp gulls among others, resulting in mass infection and mortality.At least 20,000 sea lions have reportedly died due to the disease in Chile and Peru alone. Over 500,000 seabirds — including penguins, pelicans and others — have died of the disease.Read First cases of avian flu found in Antarctic region In a first, a polar bear has died of avian flu in the Arctic, confirms Alaska In December 2023, the first death of a polar bear due to avian flu was reported from the Arctic.The cases caused fear among the scientific community, who warned of the disease reaching penguin colonies located in the remote parts of Antarctica.Speaking with The Guardian, Norman Ratcliffe, a seabird ecologist with the British Antarctic Survey, said about 98 per cent of the global population of fur seals was found in South Georgia. The region hosted “globally important populations of elephant and fur seals [and these] populations are now at risk from large declines”, he added.A risk assessment conducted by researchers warned about the virus ripping across densely populated colonies of penguins by the austral (southern) spring that may lead to “one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times”.So far, no suspected or confirmed case of infection has been reported from mainland Antarctica, according to SCAR.WorldSouth AmericaH5N1 virusAntarcticabird flu h5n1H5N1PenguinShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

Request Media Kit Login More HealthNews January 31, 2024 First cell-based flu vaccine available on the National Immunisation Program CSL Seqirus has confirmed that its cell-based influenza vaccine, Flucelvax® QUAD [quadrivalent influenza vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated, prepared in cell cultures)], will be available on the National Immunisation Program (NIP) for the 2024 Australian influenza season. Flucelvax QUAD is the first and only cell-based influenza vaccine available in Australia and will be reimbursed for people at higher risk of complications from flu, including: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples aged 5 to 64 years pregnant women people aged 5 to 64 years with co-existing medical conditions, including: cardiac disease chronic respiratory conditions chronic neurological conditions immunocompromising conditions diabetes and other metabolic disorders chronic renal failure functional or anatomical asplenia long-term aspirin therapy in children aged 5 to 10 years.1 Cell-based vaccines like Flucelvax QUAD are designed to be a close match to the strains selected by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as likely to be prevalent for the upcoming flu season. As a cell-based vaccine, Flucelvax QUAD is not affected by egg adapted vaccine virus mismatch seen in some flu seasons, which may bring potential clinical advantages.5 According to a recent study, cell-based flu vaccines demonstrated between 10 and 15% greater relative effectiveness in preventing test-confirmed influenza among people aged four to 64 years of age, across three recent seasons in the United States (2017/18 – 2019/20) compared to traditional egg-based vaccines.4 Cell-based vaccines allow Australia to be less reliant on traditional egg-based influenza vaccines and the intensive manufacturing processes they utilise.1 Influenza is a serious disease and continues to return to pre-COVID levels of circulation. In 2023 there were more than 252,000 influenza cases and 3,696 hospitalisations reported across Australia.6 Modelling suggests the true burden of flu may be higher than reported.7 According to infectious diseases expert, Professor Robert Booy, access to Flucelvax QUAD via the National Immunisation Program for the upcoming flu season is welcome news for healthcare professionals and their eligible patients. “Seasonal circulation of influenza is expected to continue, which means vulnerable groups remain at high risk of infection and potentially life-threatening complications. “Being able to offer a cell-based influenza vaccine to vulnerable patients on the NIP gives us an important option for protection against the virus, which ultimately enables more Australians to be prepared for flu season,” commented Professor Booy. “Those considered most vulnerable include people aged 65+, children under five, pregnant women, Indigenous Australians and people aged five to 64 with co-existing medical conditions. In 2023, approximately 25% of the population aged five to 64 years were vaccinated against influenza.6 With coverage like that, there’s certainly a strong chance that many vulnerable Australian’s are not getting vaccinated against influenza.” Results from the 2023 Australian Attitudes to Influenza Index, commissioned by CSL Seqirus, indicated that healthcare professionals are highly respected providers of influenza information, with seven in 10 (70%) Australians trusting healthcare professionals to provide them with information about influenza.8 Importantly, among Australians who didn’t intend to get vaccinated against influenza in 2023, 15% said they would be encouraged to get an influenza vaccination if their GP or pharmacist recommended it.8 “With the data indicating an ongoing trend for Australians to get vaccinated for influenza,8 healthcare professionals are best placed to educate individuals about the vaccine choices available and what is best for them and their family,” stated Professor Booy. Dr Julianne Bayliss, Vaccines Medical Director at CSL Seqirus says influenza vaccination is incredibly important to help take pressure off the healthcare system. “As an Australian company, we’re proud to make this cell-based flu vaccine available to help protect the most vulnerable people in our community and reduce pressure on our health system,” said Dr Bayliss. “Flucelvax QUAD is also available for Australians who do not qualify for influenza vaccination via the NIP. With 58% of Australians not aware of what flu vaccine options were available to them in 2023,8 GPs, nurses and pharmacists are best placed to discuss prevention options to help Australians make informed decisions about what suits their individual needs.” Flucelvax QUAD will be produced in Australia from 2027 when CSL Seqirus’ world-class, cell-based vaccine manufacturing facility comes online in Tullamarine, Melbourne. CSL Seqirus’ adjuvanted influenza vaccine, Fluad Quad®, will also be available on the NIP for Australians aged 65 and over in 2024. Afluria Quad® will no longer be available on the NIP.

Trends of the week COVID-19: stabilisation in the number of cases and light decrease in the positivity rate of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): increase in the number of RSV cases. Influenza: increase in the number of influenza cases. COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 From 22 to 28 January 2024 (week 4), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 increased to 156 cases, compared to 153 cases the previous week (+2%). The positivity rate fell to 6,5% compared to 7,4% the previous week. The viral concentration detected in wastewater is decreasing. [1] These indicators suggest that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has stabilised. The latest sequencing data available show a preponderance of the JN.1 variant since week 47/2023 [2]. Influenza For the week of 22 to 28 January 2024 (week 4), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories increased to 988 cases compared to 703 cases in the previous week, presenting an increase of 41%. These data largely coincide with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates high circulation of the influenza virus [2]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 22 to 28 January 2024 (week 4), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals reported by laboratories rose to 26 cases, compared with 15 the previous week, presenting an increase of 73%. The peak of the epidemic this season was reached in week 50, from 11 to 17 December 2023.

While Canadians learned a lot about how to protect themselves from illness over the course of the pandemic, new information released by health care practitioners can help inform decisions, from the availability of flu shots to any changes in COVID protocols.We’ll be publishing an update on respiratory virus season each week. Looking for more information on the topic you don’t see here? E-mail audience@globeandmail.com to see if we can help you.Open this photo in gallery:According to new public health agency data, flu season may be on the way out.Kosamtu/iStockPhoto / Getty ImagesThe latest newsThe BC Centre for Disease Control on Friday reported another influenza-related death of a child, the fourth so far this season. Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry said earlier in January that the first three children to die had both influenza and secondary bacterial infections and had not received flu shots. Still, the number of pediatric flu deaths in the province is in line with previous seasons. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has not released figures for pediatric flu deaths nationwide.As January draws to a close, the worst of the flu season may be behind us. The share of influenza tests that came back positive fell to 11.1 per cent in the week ended Jan. 20, the most recent for which figures have been published. That’s similar to the week before and down significantly from 18.7 per cent in the last week of December. The vast majority of lab-confirmed cases have been influenza A. Canada often experiences a second flu peak later in the season fuelled by influenza B.Flu shotsPublic health officials across the country say it’s not too late to get vaccinated against influenza. Find out about clinics and availability for each province and territory here:Newfoundland; Prince Edward Island; Nova Scotia; New Brunswick; Quebec; Ontario; Manitoba; Saskatchewan; Alberta; British Columbia; Yukon; Northwest Territories; NunavutFlu outlook in CanadaAll of the indicators PHAC uses to track the flu are at or below expected levels for this point in the season, according to the latest FluWatch report.In the week ended Jan. 20, provinces reported 82 flu-related hospital admissions, 10 ICU admissions and fewer than five deaths linked to the flu. Influenza A continues to dominate, with 96 per cent of flu-related hospital admissions caused by the H1N1 subtype. Seniors and children under the age of five have the highest cumulative hospitalization rates over the course of the season.COVID boostersThe three authorized vaccines, manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax, protect against the XBB.1.5 subvariant of COVID-19 and should provide good protection against related families, including the JN.1 subvariant, which now accounts for about two-thirds of cases in Canada. The reformulated mRNA shots from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are approved for anyone six months and older. Novavax’s shot is approved for those 12 and older.COVID-19 vaccine information for the provinces and territories can be found here:Newfoundland; Prince Edward Island; Nova Scotia; New Brunswick; Quebec; Ontario; Manitoba; Saskatchewan; Alberta; British Columbia; Yukon; Northwest Territories; NunavutHospitalization for COVIDAlthough the situation varies from province to province, COVID-19 activity levels are stable or decreasing in most of Canada. Nationally, the share of lab tests coming back positive has decreased over the past month. The number of hospital beds occupied by patients with COVID dropped slightly in the week ended Jan. 23, to 3,939 from 4,062 the week before. The number of patients with COVID in ICUs was nearly unchanged.Current health guidance for COVIDSymptoms of COVID-19 can vary but generally include sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, new or worsening cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, feeling feverish, chills, fatigue or weakness, muscle or body aches, new loss of smell or taste, headache, abdominal pain and diarrhea. According to Health Canada, you may start experiencing symptoms anywhere from one to 14 days after exposure. Typically, symptoms appear three to seven days after exposure.Health Canada advises following the testing guidelines provided by your local public health authority if you have symptoms or have been exposed to a person with COVID-19. If you test positive, immediately isolate yourself from others, including those in your household, and follow the advice of your local public health authority on isolation requirements.How to protect yourself and your loved ones from respiratory virusesRespiratory viruses are spread from person to person or through contact with contaminated surfaces, so it’s important to protect against both forms of transmission. Health Canada recommends wearing a medical mask or respirator, washing your hands regularly or using hand sanitizer, covering your coughs and sneezes and cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces and objects.

By ZACHARY WHALEN February 1, 2024 Chief Campus Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said the current influenza outbreak at the University will likely pass in the next two weeks. (Amanda Chou / Daily Trojan) While the current outbreak of the flu at USC will likely pass within the next two weeks, Student Health is beginning to see cases of a different influenza strain — which can be contracted immediately after the first — circulating on campus, Chief Campus Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a briefing with the Daily Trojan Wednesday morning. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put California at “high” risk for influenza activity, and the latest report from the California Department of Public Health reports that the percentage of patients with influenza-like symptoms is 1% higher than baseline levels.

USC implemented a mandate during the coronavirus pandemic in order to avoid overloading the Los Angeles healthcare system with both coronavirus and flu cases, but dropped the requirement for the 2022-23 academic year because flu mandates were not standard at other universities. In the absence of public health crises such as the coronavirus pandemic, Van Orman said USC is selective in setting vaccine requirements and balances the most important vaccines with the willingness of students to comply with mandates. “We tried to pick vaccine requirements based on community protection, and for things like measles, the community protection is very high,” Van Orman said. “[The flu vaccine] protects the community, it more protects the individual to get the vaccine, and … the [flu’s] risk to the individual is a lot lower, particularly for students, than with the other things that we have vaccine requirements on.” Van Orman said this is now more difficult than ever with current public sentiment. According to the CDC, 7.33 million fewer doses of the flu vaccine were administered this year compared to the 2023 season. Student Health will begin offering free sexually transmitted infection testing to students not on the Student Health Insurance Plan starting Feb. 10. The week will also offer information about wellness resources on campus. STI testing will not appear on students’ insurance bills and will extend through the month. In the weeks following the closure of the CVS Pharmacy within USC Village, Student Health continues to recommend that students visit the CVS Pharmacy on Figueroa Street to get their prescriptions filled. Van Orman said the USC Health Center Pharmacy next to Engemann Student Health Center is also a good option, and Student Health was working with USC Pharmacy to make it more accessible to students. “We’re really trying to raise awareness of the [Health Center Pharmacy],” Van Orman said. “There is a challenge that the [Health Center Pharmacy] isn’t open on weekends, and we know for some students that that can be a barrier. We’re continuing to work with USC Pharmacy, and they are evaluating their options.” Van Orman said the wastewater testing program at USC continues to be effective at alerting Student Health of the presence of virus outbreaks on campus, including the most recent flu outbreak and outbreaks of COVID-19. Student Health continues to use the data to monitor the virus. The University also began testing the wastewater for norovirus during the pandemic. If there were to be an outbreak of norovirus on campus, Student Health would leverage the wastewater testing system for a fast “enhanced cleaning” protocol developed alongside USC Housing. “We had [the program] in place prior to the wastewater testing, but we used to have to wait until we got a bunch of reports that people were having symptoms, and oftentimes by the time you are able to get the clinical reports … it’s almost over,” Van Orman said. “The idea is that we would be able to implement the cleaning before we had reduced the number of cases.” DONATION PLUG – PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH Thank you for reading the Daily Trojan. We are the only independent newspaper here at USC, run at every level by students. That means we aren’t tied down by any other interests but those of readers like you: the students, faculty, staff and South Central residents that together make up the USC community. Independence is a double-edged sword: We have a unique lens into the University’s actions and policies, and can hold powerful figures accountable when others cannot. But that also means our budget is severely limited. We’re already spread thin as we compensate the writers, photographers, artists, designers and editors whose incredible work you see in our daily paper; as we work to revamp and expand our digital presence, we now have additional staff making podcasts, videos, webpages, our first ever magazine and social media content, who are at risk of being unable to receive the support they deserve. We are therefore indebted to readers like you, who, by supporting us, help keep our paper daily (we are the only remaining college paper on the West Coast that prints every single weekday), independent, free and widely accessible. Please consider supporting us. Even $1 goes a long way in supporting our work; if you are able, you can also support us with monthly, or even annual, donations. Thank you.

Some patients continue to cough for two to three months despite infection clearance. There is uncertainty surrounding the cause, suggesting a potential link to how more than one virus may be in circulation and affecting individuals."Dr Shende said individuals without a history of allergic cough were now reporting persistent coughing episodes following viral infections."Despite trying various remedies, finding a resolution remains elusive," he said.Dr Sanjay Pujari, director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, said, "If the infection is Covid, it's a hypothesis that many were immune naive earlier. But now, past exposure or vaccination could be causing immune response to kick in early. So, symptoms like cough are more immune-driven rather than virus-induced."He said this could result in a prolonged cough, as the immune system's inflammation was taking time to resolve and varied from one person to another.Family physician Dr Hillary Rodrigues said, "The cough is normally dry and gets worse while lying down. It is more pronounced at night and early morning. One of the reasons could be the increasing levels of pollutio. Smog is toxic to the lungs. Other reasons could be the extreme difference in day and night temperatures. Many asthmatic and senior citizens come up with severe cough, respiratory distress and wheezing."Dr Rodrigues' recommendations include keeping bedroom windows closed at night, practising steam inhalation and avoiding outdoor activities during the late night or early morning hours. "Moreover, maintaining good hydration and steering clear of sour foods have proven effective in resolving chronic cough issues. In the face of these challenges, one must also stay warm and consider using a mask to protect against airborne pollutants," he said.Dr Rahul Kendre, lung transplant physician and interventional pulmonologist at DPU Super Specialty Hospital, Pimpri, said, "To avoid this, influenza vaccination should be annually taken prior to the start of the winter season. People should follow cough etiquettes and use masks regularly."About the AuthorNeha MadaanNeha Madaan is a senior feature writer at The Times of India, Pune.

The business supplies meat under the brand Yorkshire Ducks and Geese.On Wednesday, at Beverley Magistrates' Court, Mathison pleaded guilty to four offences relating to the outbreak.He also pleaded guilty to failing to comply with Food Safety & Hygiene Regulations (England) 2013 by operating as a slaughterhouse without the necessary approval. What is bird flu and what's behind the outbreak? The offences relating to the outbreak included:Failing to keep ducks, within an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone, housed in a suitable building so as to prevent ingress from wild birdsFailing to keep records of all duck deaths as per an order by the Minister of StateFailing to comply with a Restriction Notice by removing poultry meat from the premisesFailing to comply with a Restriction Notice by removing old insulation from the premisesThe court heard that government officials visited the farm on 12 April 2023 to investigate a possible bird flu outbreak.It was confirmed the disease was present in the duck flock the following day, the court heard. Investigations by East Riding of Yorkshire Council later found slaughtering and meat production activities had expanded beyond the permitted limit, which required FSA approval.After sentencing, Angela Dearing, the council's director of housing, transportation and public protection, said: "It is highly likely this avian influenza outbreak would not have happened if compulsory housing measures to ensure separation from wild birds had been complied with. "It is fortunate the outbreak did not spread further when the disease control restrictions were breached."Ms Dearing said in addition to "catastrophic consequences" for Mathison's business, the measures required to control the outbreak and prevent its spread had "significantly impacted on other local livestock keepers".In addition to the fines, Mathison was ordered to pay Â£6,000 costs and a Â£2,000 victim surcharge. He was given 12 months to pay.Correction: An earlier version of this article contained incorrect information provided by Beverley Magistrates' Court, which has since been amended.Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, external, X (formerly Twitter), external, and Instagram, external.

Rahul MUpdated: Tuesday, January 30, 2024, 09:57 PM IST Penguins | Representational Image | Pexels The first deaths due to bird flu in the penguin population in Antarctica has have been reported. One king penguin is suspected to have died due to the highly contagious H5N1 virus or bird flu on South Georgia island in the Antarctic region. The second case is related to the death of a gentoo penguin. In addition to suspected cases, one confirmed case of a gentoo penguin dying due to bird flu has also been recorded in the continent. The Antarctic mainland has so far not reported cases of bird flu in pinguins. Following the first deaths of penguins in Antarctica due to bird flu, experts have warned of possible major H5N1 outbreak in the penguin population in Antarctica. "The arrival of this H5N1 virus in the Antarctic towards the end of last year rang alarm bells because of the risk it posed to wildlife in this fragile ecosystem," Ed Hutchinson, a molecular virologist at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, told a UK-based publication.Diana Bell, emeritus professor of conservation biology at the University of East Anglia, warned of quick spread of the virus, adding that she had feared something like this would happen. "I am just devastated, really – as will everybody who cares about penguins and the Antarctic … Given their colonial social organisation, you’d just wonder how quickly it would go through the colonies," she was quoted as saying.

Some strains of the virus such as H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6, have raised concern because they can rarely infect humans too. Bird Flu In Antarctica:The arrival of bird flu in Antarctica in late 2023 has raised major concerns for the continent's fragile ecosystem. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain H5N1 was first detected in a brown skua on Bird Island, part of the South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, in October 2023. Since then, the virus has spread to other seabird species and even infected marine mammals like elephant seals.

We look at the state of this year’s flu season. The 2024 winter flu season began earlier than in recent years and has been at epidemic level in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region since December. Doctors at the time expressed their concern at the low numbers of people getting their flu vaccinations, despite a high profile campaign and free injections for at-risk people. Map of the flu epidemic in France Pic: Visactu / The Connexion 91% of people not vaccinated Public health authority Santé Publique France noted that 91% of people consulting for flu symptoms were not vaccinated against the flu viruses in circulation. People who are immunocompromised, over 65, pregnant, overweight or are in contact with vulnerable people are urged to get a free vaccination, if they do not already have one. The free vaccination campaign has been extended until February 29. Even if you are in an ‘at-risk’ category, you can still get a vaccination, although you may have to buy the vaccine (€6 to €12 depending on the brand). You can ask a doctor, pharmacist, nurse or midwife to administer it. The price of a vaccination for people not targeted by the winter flu campaign is: Ad In a pharmacy: €7.50 By a nurse: €7.56 By a doctor: €8.50 (the €25 consultation is reimbursed 70% for vaccinations) By a midwife: €8.50 Read more: Why might I be asked to wear a mask on French public transport?

This innovative technique, tested successfully in mice, offers a potential game-changer in the fight against not only COVID-19 but also other challenging viruses like HIV and influenza.MIT Professor Mark Bathe, along with Harvard Medical School’s Daniel Lingwood and Aaron Schmidt, spearheads this transformative research, which has significant implications for future vaccine development. The project was funded by major organizations, including the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Fast Grants program.Other senior authors of the study published in Nature Communications include lead authors Eike-Christian Wamhoff, Larance Ronsard, Jared Feldman, Grant Knappe, and Blake Hauser.A Potential Solution for Challenging VirusesImmunology has focused on peptide vaccines because of their potent humoral immune response and ability to replicate the structure of the virus. Unfortunately, earlier attempts to use protein scaffolds frequently resulted in unneeded immune responses that took focus away from the target antigen. The MIT researchers found that their DNA scaffold, unlike protein scaffolds, did not induce distracting immune responses.“DNA, we found in this work, does not elicit antibodies that may distract away from the protein of interest,” explains Professor Bathe. “Your immune system is being fully trained by that target antigen, and that’s what you want – for your immune system to be laser-focused on the antigen of interest.”The study suggests that this approach, which strongly stimulates B cells responsible for antibody production, could simplify the development of vaccines against viruses notoriously challenging to target, such as HIV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Unlike T-cell-based immunity triggered by other vaccines, the B cells activated by this DNA scaffold approach can persist for decades, providing long-term protection.Daniel Lingwood, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, emphasizes the potential of this technique in overcoming conventional vaccine limitations. “This idea of decoupling the response against the target antigen from the platform itself is a potentially powerful immunological trick,” Lingwood notes.DNA Origami: Precision in Vaccine DesignMIT’s innovative approach involves using DNA origami, providing precise control over the synthetic DNA’s structure. In a 2020 study, the researchers demonstrated the efficacy of a DNA scaffold carrying 30 copies of an HIV antigen in generating a strong antibody response. The structure closely mimics nano-sized viruses, displaying multiple copies of viral proteins on their surfaces.When testing the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in mice, the researchers observed high levels of antibodies to the spike protein while avoiding immune responses to the DNA scaffold itself. In contrast, a vaccine based on a traditional protein scaffold generated antibodies against both the scaffold protein and SARS-CoV-2, complicating repeated usage.“The DNA nanoparticle itself is immunologically silent,” remarks Lingwood. This silence minimizes off-target effects and holds promise for developing a vaccine inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies against various SARS-CoV-2 variants.Nevertheless, in the future, the researchers are exploring whether a DNA scaffold with multiple viral antigens attached could induce broadly neutralizing antibodies against not only SARS-CoV-2 but also related viruses within the sarbeco subgenus, including those responsible for SARS and MERS.FacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedinReddIt The LatestiPhone 17: Apple’s Thinnest iPhone Yet, with Single Camera & ProMotion Microsoft is replacing Mail and Calendar with Outlook by the End of 2024 Create Stunning Videos with Google Vids: The AI Video Tool for Seamless Collaboration Partner With UsDigital advertising offers a way for your business to reach out and make much-needed connections with your audience in a meaningful way.
