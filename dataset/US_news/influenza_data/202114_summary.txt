1. Influenza viruses cause annual epidemics and occasional pandemics of respiratory tract infections in humans.
2. The novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and has caused a pandemic.
3. Both viral and host factors determine the extent and severity of virus-induced lung damage.
4. The host's response to viral infection is necessary for viral clearance but may also contribute to severe disease phenotypes.
5. Tissue repair mechanisms are required for recovery from infection, but dysregulated repair responses may lead to chronic lung dysfunction.
6. Understanding the mechanisms of immunopathology and tissue repair following viral lower respiratory tract infection can inform treatment options.
7. Influenza virus infection has been well-characterized in terms of pathogenesis, host response, and repair mechanisms.
8. Information about SARS-CoV-2 and its disease manifestations in humans is still being learned, but there are similarities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.
9. Influenza viruses are classified into four genera (IAV, IBV, ICV, and IDV), with IAVs and IBVs being of main concern for human health.
10. Influenza viruses are constantly evolving within animal reservoirs, such as avian species.
