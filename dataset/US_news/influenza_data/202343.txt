A taxonomy can help organize and map information to support identification of infodemic insights. Public health taxonomies for social listening have been developed and implemented by WHO for COVID-19 and for mpox.Now, in-line with the new WHO Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) initiative that focuses on pathogens transmitted via respiratory means, a new taxonomy has been developed for social listening on Respiratory Pathogens on Respiratory Pathogens. This taxonomy takes a broad view, encompassing viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens across the five taxonomy topic areas of the cause, illness, intervention, treatments and information. The new report details the development of the taxonomy and provides advice for analysts looking to incorporate it into their work.This taxonomy adds to other recent tools produced by the WHO infodemic management team to support pandemic planning including OpenWHO training modules modules on taxonomy development and other infodemic topics, the WHO/UNICEF How to build an infodemic insights report in 6 steps report, and a new respiratory pathogen portal on WHO Early AI-Powered Social Listening Tool (EARS) platform.The WHO EARS platform was launched in December 2020 to help to understand public concern during the pandemic. The platform uses a public health taxonomy to categorise content from online sources such as social media, news articles and blogs, and presents it in real-time. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, over 100 million posts were analysed, allowing infodemic managers, health authorities and analysts insight into public conversation's, concerns and misinformation to help inform the response.The new respiratory pathogen taxonomy has been integrated into WHO EARS and a pilot is being trialled with 30 countries and 17 languages. The public facing dashboard allows all users to see where conversations are escalating, what people are talking publicly about the most, and if there are information voids or gender differences in conversations. A new social indicators panel tracks social change and provides indication of how conversations may be changing. A comprehensive back-end with increased functionality is available for use by regional and country WHO teams to inform and guide their Infodemic response.The pivot of the WHO EARS platform from COVID-19 to respiratory pathogens demonstrates the ability of this innovative platform to continue to support social listening across different areas of pandemic and infodemic preparedness. Ongoing testing and iterations on the platform, including review of countries and languages, will ensure the approach remains relevant and useful.

Based on previous seasons’ data, 2022-2023 was considered a high-severity influenza season for children and adolescents under the age of 18, according to the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.Researchers explained that the CDC annually assesses the severity of each influenza season based on previous seasons, estimating the numbers and rates of influenza-associated medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States. Consequently, the researchers’ report compared the impact of the 2022-2023 influenza season on children and adolescents to that of the 2016-2017 season through the 2021-2022 season; they excluded data from the 2020-2021 season as it was during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with minimal influenza activity. To examine these areas, the CDC utilized 3 indicators:The percentage of all outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) obtained from the US Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance NetworkThe rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization, which were estimated through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET)Death registry data from the National Vital Statistics System were used to calculate the percentage of all deaths due to influenzaThe researchers explained that, for each severity indicator, they calculated the 50th, 90th, and 98th intensity thresholds (ITs) based on the mean of peak weekly values in previous seasons. They added that seasonal severity is classified as low if at least 2 of 3 indicators peak below IT50. On the other hand, it is classified as moderate, high, or very high if at least 2 of 3 indicators peak above IT50, IT90, or IT98, respectively.Flu shotImage credit: xtock - stock.adobe.comFrom this study, the researchers classified the 2022-2203 influenza season for children and adolescents as high severity because the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for ILI, the influenza-associated hospitalization rate, and the percentage of deaths due to influenza all peaked between IT90 and IT98. Overall, rates of influenza-associated medical visits and hospitalizations among children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years were higher during 2022-2023 than any season since 2016-2017.Between October 1, 2022, and April 30, 2023, FluSurv-NET identified 2762 influenza-associated hospitalizations of patients younger than 18 years, 2108 of which they sampled. Similar to recent seasons, the researchers found the median (IQR) age of patients hospitalized to be 5 (2-9) years, 57.4% were male, and 50.5% had an underlying condition, the most common being asthma, obesity, and neurologic disorders. Notably, more than half of the 2022-2023 season’s total pediatric hospitalizations occurred between October and November 2022.The researchers hypothesized that the high hospitalization rates during the 2022-2023 season occurred due to early influenza circulation before many patients had been vaccinated. Of those hospitalized that had data within FluSurv-NET, 18.3% received an influenza vaccine; this was much lower than other seasons where 35.8% to 41.8% of hospitalized patients were vaccinated. Additionally, of the symptomatic hospitalized patients, 64.9% received influenza antiviral treatment, which was lower than in prepandemic influenza seasons (80.8%-87.1%).They also acknowledged their study’s limitations, one being that they based the severity assessments and incidence estimation adjustments for the frequency of influenza testing and other ratios on previous seasons’ data. Because of this, the data may not reflect current testing practices or care-seeking behaviors. Another limitation mentioned was that FluSurv-NET only covers approximately 9.0% of the US population, meaning that the characteristics of hospitalized children and adolescents may not be generalizable to all US pediatric hospitalizations.Despite these limitations, the researchers noted that the study still demonstrated the high severity of the 2022-2023 influenza season among children and adolescents, as influenza-associated medical visits and hospitalizations met or exceeded those of previous seasons.“Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of children and adolescents receiving a seasonal influenza vaccination, ideally by the end of October, and prompt influenza antiviral treatment for those who are hospitalized,” the authors wrote.ReferenceWhite EB, O’Halloran A, Sundaresan D, et al.

Bryant, MD, FAAPInfluenza (the flu) can be deadly for older adults. But did you know that the flu can be very serious for babies and young children? Last flu season was off to an early start. In October 2022, flu hospitalization rates were the highest in 10 years for children under age 4 years and older adults. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages as many children as possible to get a flu vaccine every year. Babies and children can get other recommended immunizations when they get their flu shot. Fortunately, parents and caregivers have immune-boosting tools to keep babies healthy. Influenza may be spreading in many areas, but it is not too late to get a flu shot. We do not know how long or severe this influenza season will be. Read on for ways to prevent flu from spreading to infants and young children.Are babies and young children at higher risk from the flu?Yes. Because of their age, even healthy babies and young children are at higher risk of getting very sick from the flu. Here's what we know:Kids younger than age 2 years are at highest risk.Infants younger than age 6 months have the highest rates of hospitalization and death. They are too young to be vaccinated. Healthy children age 2 years to 5 years are more likely to be taken to a doctor, an urgent care center or the emergency room because of flu, compared to older healthy kids. Parents also should keep in mind: Your baby's immune system is still developing. This can put them at higher risk of infection from viruses like flu or make it harder to respond to infections.Your young child may not have been exposed to influenza viruses. Because the past two flu seasons were mild, some young children might not have immunity to influenza.Does my baby need two doses of the flu shot?Maybe. Two doses are needed if your child is age 6 months to 8 years and: it is the first time they are being vaccinated against influenza or they have only received one dose of flu vaccine ever before July 1, 2023. The doses are given four weeks apart. After the first dose, the immune system gets ready to respond to influenza. Young children may not have a high level of immune protection yet. After the second dose, they have a higher level of immune protection. Just one dose is needed each year after that.Two weeks after they receive all recommended doses of flu vaccine, their immune system will be fully ready to respond. The next time your child is exposed to influenza, they will be better prepared to avoid getting very sick. Babies can get the flu shot at any point in the flu season. Sooner is better, especially the first time they get the vaccine or if they only had one dose ever.Do breastfed babies need a flu shot? Yes. Flu vaccines are recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding people and their babies age 6 months and older. Getting a flu shot while pregnant or breastfeeding helps your baby boost their immune system. Antibodies against flu are passed to your baby in the womb or through breastmilk.Once babies are 6 months or older, being vaccinated enhances their immunity. Household members benefit from immune-boosting protection of the influenza vaccine, too. They will be less likely to expose babies to the flu. It's like having a cocoon around the baby to protect them if they are too young to be vaccinated. When should I call the pediatrician about my baby's flu symptoms?If your baby or young child has emergency warning signs of flu, seek medical care for them right away. Young children or those with underlying medical conditions are at a higher risk of complications from the flu. Your pediatrician can help determine if they need flu antiviral drugs. Flu antiviral drugs work best when they are started within 48 hours of the start of symptoms. However, they can be started later in children who are severely ill or at high risk. Parents and their pediatrician should discuss the risks and benefits of antiviral medication. Any child who has worsening flu symptoms should be examined by a health care provider. Keep in mind that:Children who develop breathing difficulties may need to be treated with oxygen or require other respiratory support. Vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration. When this happens, they may need extra fluids given through an intravenous catheter. Antibiotics do not treat the flu. However, your child may need them if they develop an ear infection, bacterial pneumonia or other problem. Antiviral drugs prescribed to treat COVID-19 do not work to treat flu. Only flu antiviral drugs work to treat flu. What should parents of young children do if they get sick with influenza?Parents or caregivers who develop flu symptoms should call their health care provider to determine whether they need antiviral medicine. Ideally, sick caregivers should arrange for another healthy adult in the home to care for their baby or young child. If no other caregiver is available, wear a face mask when holding, feeding or providing care to help prevent the spread of virus. RememberThe flu virus is common. It is also not predictable. Most people who get the flu are sick for at least a week. Some people get much sicker, and even healthy young children may get very sick. For children who are at least 6 months of age, influenza vaccine is the best way to avoid serious illness.

Following reports of several potentially symptomatic birds and unexplained mortality, British Antarctic Survey (BAS) staff on Bird Island took samples for testing. The swabs were returned to the UK and tested by the Animal and Plant Health Agency laboratories in Weybridge, where they returned positive results for HPAI H5N1. Natural pathways are the primary means of spread of HPAI and it is likely that the spread of the disease was caused by the return of birds from their migration to South America, where there are a high number of HPAI cases. BAS and Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) remain vigilant for further cases and science and visitor programmes are currently continuing under enhanced biosecurity measures. BAS is working in close partnership with the GSGSSI, guided by their tiered response plan to monitor and manage the outbreak. The most recent version of these protocols can be found in the GSGSSI Biosecurity Handbook. Brown skua (Catharacta antarctica) on Bird Island, South Georgia (Richard Phillips) BAS operates two research stations on South Georgia, including one at Bird Island where the confirmed cases were identified. As result of the confirmed cases of HPAI, the majority of field work involving animal handling has been suspended. Biosecurity measures continue, including the enhanced cleaning of clothing and field equipment, and observation of areas of high wildlife density. Key elements of the wider science programme at Bird Island continue under caution, including long-term monitoring of marine predators such as wandering, black-browed and grey-headed albatrosses, northern and southern giant petrels, macaroni penguins, and gentoo penguins. These observations make Bird Island one of the most closely monitored seabird colonies in the world, equipping scientists and conservationists with indicators of change for species. It is not possible to forecast the impacts of HPAI across South Georgia, given that the patterns of transmission and mortality in Europe and the Americas space has been highly variable. GSGSSI and BAS will continue to work together to monitor the impact of the wildlife at Bird Island, and the potential spread to other areas. Background on Avian influenza Avian influenza is a viral disease that primarily affects birds. Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses are common in wild birds and often cause no signs of disease. However, some strains of the virus including H5 and H7 are highly pathogenic in domestic poultry and can cause high mortality if they escape into wild bird populations. These are known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The current outbreak of H5N1 HPAI began in 2022 and has resulted in the death of high numbers of seabirds in the Northern Hemisphere, the south of Africa and around the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and throughout South America. Whilst predominantly still a virus that affects birds, during the current outbreak some mammals have been infected. Often this is due to predators and scavengers consuming infected birds or carcasses, but cases have also been noted in some marine mammals where this mode of transmission would not apply. Although primarily a virus that is spread among birds, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has noted that whilst the number of cases in humans is extremely rare, the increasing number of detections of the current H5N1 strain among mammals raises concerns that the virus might adapt to infect humans more easily. The primary means of spread of HPAI is though natural pathways and he confirmed presence of the disease on the South American continent made it highly probably that the disease would arrive in South Georgia in the 23/24 season. In readiness the Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) updated its guidance on HPAI risk and response in the Territory. These included enhanced biosecurity procedures and mitigation measures to be put in place for different groups/activities depending on the HPAI risk at each visitor landing or science site. Whilst the source of the disease on Bird Island is not certain, it is likely that it was introduced via skuas returning from their migration in Argentina where there are known to be a high number of cases. The presence of HPAI could have serious implications for the Territories abundant seabird colonies and GSGSSI and British Antarctic Survey are working in partnerships to monitor the ongoing impacts.

A pharmacist prepares to administer a shot of Covid-19 vaccine Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel/AP CNN — Vaccines for Covid-19 and influenza may slightly increase the risk of strokes caused by blood clots in the brains of seniors, particularly when the two vaccines are given at the same time and when they are given to adults who are age 85 and older, according to a new study. The safety signal was detected by experts at the US Food and Drug Administration who analyzed data from Medicare claims. It is the second study to find an elevated risk of stroke for seniors after Covid-19 and flu vaccinations given together. The US Centers for Disease Control and FDA issued a public communication in January explaining that one of their near real-time vaccine safety monitoring studies — called the Vaccine Safety Datalink — had picked up a small and uncertain risk of stroke for older adults who received a dose of Pfizer’s bivalent Covid-19 vaccine and a high-dose or adjuvanted flu shot on the same day. That study triggered the FDA’s broader look at strokes after vaccination noted in the medical records of seniors on Medicare. That said, the risk identified in the FDA’s study appears to be very small — roughly 3 strokes or transient ischemic attacks for every 100,000 doses given — and the study found it may be primarily driven by the high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines, which are specially designed to rev up the immune system so it mounts a stronger response to the shot. Pfizer_Updated_COVID_Vaccine_for_Ages_5_to_11_Single-Dose_Vial Pfizer Inc. When to get the new Covid-19 vaccine to maximize your protection In additional analysis of the Medicare claims data, the FDA researchers found a very slightly increased risk of stroke in adults ages 65 and older who’d only gotten a high dose flu shot. In absolute terms, the extra risk from high-dose flu shots amounted to 1-2 strokes for every 100,000 doses. “The absolute risk is miniscule,” said Dr. Steve Nissen, a cardiologist and researcher at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. “I mean it is trivial in comparison to the risk for people over 85 of dying from Covid.” At least five other recent studies — many launched to try to tease out this link, have not found any additional risk of stroke after vaccination for Covid-19, influenza or both. “Available data do not provide clear and consistent evidence of a safety problem for ischemic stroke with bivalent mRNA Covid-19 vaccines when given alone or given simultaneously with influenza vaccines,” said Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, director of the Immunization Safety Office at the CDC in a public presentation of the data on Wednesday to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Researchers say they are continuing to probe the possible link, but in the meantime, they say everyone should still get vaccinated since any tiny increase in risk of a stroke after vaccination is dwarfed by the increased risk of stroke or other serious outcomes following either a flu or Covid-19 infection. Video Ad Feedback 'Body aches, fever': Doctor distinguishes difference between Covid and flu 01:49 - Source: CNN “The risk of serious disease associated with both influenza and Covid for the population at highest risk, which is of course, older persons, is so much greater than the potential increased risk associated with a vaccine,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. “That’s a hard equation for the average person to do,” Schaffner said. Spread out your shots? Schaffner said people who are worried could consider getting each shot at different times rather than together. “That’s a reasonable thing to do,” he said. Schaffner, who is in his mid-80s, said he got both his Covid and flu vaccines at the same time, in the same arm, and had very little reaction afterwards. A few weeks ago, however, Dr. Peter Marks, head of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said he was planning to get his Covid-19 vaccine first, followed by his influenza vaccine about two weeks later. “If you want to minimize the chance of interactions and minimize confusing the side effects from one with another, you wait about two weeks between the vaccines,” Marks said on an FDA stakeholder call in September. Other experts said they hoped the information wouldn’t confuse people or deter them from getting their vaccines, since the benefits of getting them still greatly outweigh the risks. “The bottom line is that these are small signals. We’re not entirely sure whether they are valid, and they certainly do not lead themselves to any change in the recommendations for people getting either Covid or influenza vaccines at the present time,” Schaffner said.

Getting vaccinated now can help For the study, FDA investigators looked at the medical claims of more than 5.3 million adults ages 65 and older who were enrolled in Medicare and received a bivalent Covid-19 vaccine made by Pfizer or Moderna. They saw no increased risk of stroke in the overall group after Covid-19 vaccination. When they looked at adults ages 85 and older, they found an elevated risk of strokes caused by blood clots in those who’d had Pfizer vaccines, but not in those who got Moderna shots. Seniors age 65 and older who got a bivalent vaccine and high-dose or adjuvanted flu shot at the same time also had an increased risk of blood clots in their brains. The study is observational, meaning it can only show associations, it can’t prove cause and effect. It was also posted as a preprint ahead of peer review by outside experts and publication in a medical journal. Study sees link to seizures in young kids A separate FDA investigation of more than 4 million records from three large commercial insurance databases, found a very small and tenuous link between seizures in children between the ages of 2 and 5 and Covid-19 vaccination. Children this age appeared to be slightly more likely to have seizures after Covid-19 vaccination compared with background seizure rates in the general population in 2020 — a year when infectious diseases were lower in kids because of masks and social distancing. The signal disappeared, however, when researchers compared it with background rates of seizures reported in US children in 2022, a year when infections in kids rebounded. That study was also posted as a preprint. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team. The study authors said their findings should be interpreted with caution, since most were associated with fevers, which are common in kids. Vaccination can also cause kids to run fevers. They said they hoped their findings would be investigated in a more robust epidemiological study. About 4% of children experience seizures triggered by fevers, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Dr. Phillip Yang, a cardiologist at Stanford Health Care, said the findings didn’t look particularly concerning. “It’s not unusual after Covid vaccine that we have little bit of a fever that could trigger a seizure, and kids who are more susceptible to it. So again, it’s not a surprising finding,” Yang said.

Bird flu last year cost U.S. poultry producers nearly 59 million birds across 47 states, including egg-laying chickens and turkeys and chickens raised for meat, making it the country's deadliest outbreak ever, according to USDA figures. The outbreak caused spikes in egg and turkey prices for consumers and cost the government over $660 million.Iowa was the hardest-hit state last year, with nearly 16 million birds lost, but there hadn't been a case reported in the state since March. Iowa's department reported Friday that one commercial turkey facility of about 50,000 birds in Buena Vista County was affected. Another facility of about 47,500 turkeys in neighboring Pocahontas County was confirmed Monday.In Guthrie County, about 50 backyard birds were also infected, the department said.Before last week, the only reports of bird flu in recent months in the U.S. were sporadic appearances in backyard flocks or among wild birds such as ducks, geese and eagles. While wild birds often show no symptoms of avian influenza, infections in them are a concern to the poultry industry as migration season gets underway. Migrating birds can spread the disease to vulnerable commercial flocks.Bird flu infections are relatively rare in humans and aren't considered a food safety risk. But as it hits other species, including some mammals, scientists fear the virus could evolve to spread more easily among people. Earlier this month, South Africa culled about 7.5 million chickens in an effort to contain dozens of outbreaks of two separate strains of avian influenza, the government and national poultry association said. And Cambodia has reported three human deaths from bird flu this year.

Scientists tested different combo vaccine candidates in healthy adults ages 18 to 64 against a licensed flu vaccine and the companies' earlier bivalent (two-strain) COVID vaccine, with both vaccines given at the same visit. Lead formulations of the combo vaccines prompted robust immune responses against influenza A, influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The safety results for the combo vaccines were similar to the vaccine against COVID. Based on the findings, the companies said they would advance the lead formulations to a phase 3 trial in the months ahead. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given the company fast-track designation for the new vaccine. Annaliesa Anderson, PhD, Pfizer’s senior vice president and head of vaccine development, said in a statement that the companies are encouraged by the early trial results, which will appear in a peer-reviewed journal soon. “This vaccine has the potential to lessen the impact of two respiratory diseases with a single injection and may simplify immunization practices for providers, patients, and healthcare systems all over the world,” she said. Earlier this month, Moderna reported promising findings from an early clinical trial of its mRNA combo vaccine against flu and COVID. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant more common, tied to more severe outcomes than flu, RSV News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 Patrik Slezak / iStock SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infections were more common and linked to more severe outcomes than influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in emergency department (ED) patients in Sweden, especially among those unvaccinated against COVID-19. The findings were published yesterday in Clinical Infectious Diseases. Karolinska Institutet researchers assessed rates of 30-day all-cause death, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission of adults seen in six EDs in Stockholm County for Omicron, flu, or RSV infection in 2021-2022 and 2015-2019. Of 6,385 patients in 2021-2022, 76% were infected with Omicron, 17% had flu, and 7% had RSV. In total, 22.1% of Omicron patients were unvaccinated against COVID-19 before their ED visit, while 75% had received at least two doses. Lower odds of death after COVID vaccination Thirty-day death rates were 7.9% in the Omicron group, 2.5% in flu patients, and 6.0% in the RSV group. Omicron patients' adjusted death odds ratio (OR) was 2.36 compared with flu and 1.42 compared with RSV. Stronger links were seen in unvaccinated Omicron patients relative to flu (OR, 5.51) and RSV (OR, 3.29). Death rates at 30 days were 15% among Omicron patients aged 75 years or older, compared with 8% in the 2021-2022 flu group, 12% in the 2021-2022 RSV cohort, 7% among 5,709 prepandemic flu patients, and 9% among 955 prepandemic RSV patients. Among Omicron patients who received at least two COVID-19 vaccine doses, the OR for death was 2.00 compared with flu and 1.20 compared with RSV. This underscores the need for public health strategies for managing and mitigating the impact of Omicron and other viral respiratory infections, with continued assessments of their comparative severity. Ninety-day mortality was 11% among Omicron patients, 3.7% in 2021-2022 flu patients, 8.7% in 2021-2022 RSV patients, 5.1% in the prepandemic flu group, and 9.6% in prepandemic RSV patients. In 2021-2022, 30-day mortality was 2.6% for influenza A patients; none of the 17 influenza B patients died. From 2015 to 2019, 30-day mortality was 3.2% in influenza A patients and 3.8% in influenza B patients. "This underscores the need for public health strategies for managing and mitigating the impact of Omicron and other viral respiratory infections, with continued assessments of their comparative severity," the authors wrote. Quick takes: Slight US flu rise, more global polio, avian flu strikes more US poultry News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Influenza, General Polio Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) US flu indicators showed more slight rises last week, though levels are still below baselines, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its latest update. The percentage of outpatient visits for flulike illnesses increased slightly, to 2.5%, but is still below the 2.9% baseline. Increases in hospitalizations were noted in six regions, but with levels stable in the Midwest, Northwest, and Northeast. Test positivity increased in the South and West, with influenza A making up 71.6% samples at clinical labs, mostly the 2009 H1N1 strain. Four countries reported more polio cases this week, including Pakistan, which reported another wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case, bringing its total for the year to four, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative said in its latest weekly update. Three African nations reported more vaccine-derived cases, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Madagascar, with more circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases, and Kenya, with another circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case. Highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks struck more commercial turkey farms in four states—California, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa—according to the latest notifications from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Also, more outbreaks in backyard flocks were reported in Iowa, Oregon, and Minnesota. The events are part of an increase in avian flu activity that began in early October. In international developments, Bulgaria reported two H5N1 outbreaks on large poultry farms, Romania reported a detection involving backyard birds, and Mexico reported the virus in a healthy wild duck from a wetland in Jalisco state that was tested as part of surveillance, according to notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH).

October 23, 2023 As flu season approaches, getting a flu shot and timing it right will help protect you and your loved ones from a potentially serious illness.Each year, about 8% of the U.S. population contracts the flu. While most cases are moderate, the flu can lead to hospitalization and even death.“Each flu season is different, but in a typical flu season, millions get the flu, hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized, and thousands to tens of thousands die from flu-related causes,” says pharmacist Matthew Burdett, PharmD. “Getting vaccinated is the best means of protection.”Why an annual shot?The flu vaccine is designed to protect against the strains of influenza virus that are most likely to circulate in a season. Yearly vaccination is needed for the best protection.“The influenza viruses are constantly changing and mutating, so each year the flu vaccine is updated to include four strains that are most likely to be circulating that year,” Dr. Burdett explains. “Also, a person’s immune protection declines over time, so annual vaccination is needed for optimal protection.”Who is most impacted by the flu?While it is recommended that everyone aged 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine, certain populations are at a higher risk of developing severe complications. These individuals should prioritize getting vaccinated to protect themselves and minimize the impact of the flu on their health.1. Adults aged 65 and older: Older adults have a higher risk of flu-related complications due to age-related changes in their immune system.2. Individuals with certain health conditions: People with chronic illnesses such as asthma, heart disease, diabetes and kidney disease are more susceptible to severe complications from the flu.3. Pregnant women: While pregnant, women experience changes in their immune system that make them more vulnerable to respiratory infections like the flu.4. Young children: Children under the age of 5, especially those under 2 years old, are at a higher risk of developing complications from the flu.5. Those with immunocompromising conditions: Individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those undergoing cancer treatment or with HIV/AIDS, have a weaker ability to fight off infections like the flu.Ideal timing for a flu shotTiming plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of the flu shot. While the influenza viruses spread year-round, they historically peak between December and March, with February being the most common month for peak activity.“Because it takes up to two weeks to build immunity from the vaccine, it’s usually best to get flu vaccines in September and October,” Dr. Burdett says. “If you missed that window, you can still protect yourself against flu outbreaks, particularly in years with a later peak.”Other considerationsFor those over age 65, a high-dose flu vaccine can produce a stronger immune response. Data shows that standard-dose flu shot does not work as well in adults over age 65.Additionally, Dr. Burdett says some data suggests using a high-dose flu shot in immunocompromised patients, even when they are younger than 65 years old, elicits stronger immune responses.“There can sometimes be insurance issues because it’s outside the normal indications, and not all pharmacies can administer a high-dose shot to those under 65,” he says. “So, it would be best to get in a clinic or have a prescription with a note on the prescription sent to the pharmacy.”Still need your flu shot?The flu shot can be administered by your primary care doctor at your next appointment or at your local pharmacy.

CDC is working to increase flu vaccination rates by using proven strategies to raise awareness of how serious flu can be and break down barriers to vaccination. The Vital Signs report looked at flu hospitalization rates from 2009–2022 and flu vaccination coverage from 2010–2022 by race and ethnicity, from two data sources, the Influenza-Associated Hospitalization Network (FluSurv-NET) and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Flu vaccines are the best way to protect against flu and its potentially serious complications. Improving access to and trust in flu vaccines among people is critical to help reduce inequities." Debra Houry, M.D., M.P.H. CDC Acting Principal Deputy Director Flu vaccination coverage has been consistently lower among Black, Hispanic, and AI/AN adults since 2010. During the 2021–2022 season, flu vaccination coverage was 54% among White and Asian adults, 42% among Black adults, 38% among Hispanic adults, and 41% among AI/AN adults. Black, Hispanic, and AI/AN adults were hospitalized with flu at higher rates than White adults during most seasons from 2009 to 2022.* Compared to White adults, hospitalization rates were nearly: Related StoriesVALANX Biotech and Fina Biosolutions Introduce ClickCRM for Rapid Conjugate Vaccine DevelopmentRecruitment underway for a clinical trial testing new vaccine against respiratory virusesResearch suggests no need for yellow fever vaccine booster after initial dose 80% higher among Black adults, 30% higher among AI/AN adults, and 20% higher among Hispanic adults. There are many reasons for disparities in severe outcomes of flu, including lack of access to health care and insurance, missed opportunities to vaccinate, and misinformation and distrust that contribute to lower levels of confidence in vaccines. People from certain racial and ethnic minority groups have higher rates of asthma, diabetes, obesity, and other chronic conditions. These increase the risk for serious flu complications. Racism and prejudice also are known to worsen inequalities. Over the past two years, CDC began programs to address barriers to flu vaccination and raise awareness about its importance, specifically among people from racial and ethnic minority groups. These include the Partnering for Vaccine Equity (P4VE) program and a targeted, national flu vaccination campaign. These programs use proven actions to help increase vaccination among people from racial and ethnic minority communities. Health care providers, state and federal officials, and individuals can work together to fight flu by taking steps to increase vaccine uptake in everyone, including people from racial and ethnic minority groups. Health care providers can strongly recommend flu vaccination to patients and make culturally appropriate vaccine recommendations. This could include using materials with images representative of those in the community, providing information that is transparent and promotes the benefits of and reasons for vaccination, addressing community-specific concerns and misinformation, such as vaccine side effects or risk, and using the predominant language spoken in the community, such as Spanish. State and local governments should identify and remove barriers to vaccination and work with community organizations to increase access and convenience.Partnering with trusted messengers and promoting culturally relevant messages can build trust and confidence in vaccines and advance equity. Everyone should get vaccinated against flu today and encourage others in their community to get a flu vaccine for the best protection against flu this fall and winter.

Welcome to the cold and flu season. Following two mild flu seasons due to COVID-19 lockdowns, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considered the U.S. 2022–23 influenza season moderately severe, with an estimate of at least 31 million symptomatic illnesses, 14 million medical visits, 360,000 hospitalizations, and 21,000 deaths caused by influenza virus infection. The rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations was similar to hospitalization rates of four pre-COVID-19 seasons (2014–15, 2016–17, 2018–19, and 2019–20) and higher than all but one remaining season (2017–18) since the 2010–11 season. The number of death certificates with influenza listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death during the 2022–23 season (9,697) was above the average number of influenza-coded deaths (8,530) during the five seasons preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (2015–16 through 2019–20) and three to 10 times higher than the number of influenza-coded deaths during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains to be seen whether the 2023–24 flu season will be mild or severe. The best plan of action is to adhere to your facility’s cleaning practices and protocols, and encourage your employees and building occupants to receive their flu vaccinations. Two infection control experts, Jordan Bastian, a senior infection preventionist with CloroxPro’s Clinical and Scientific Affairs team, and Jason Welch, a formulating chemist with Spartan Chemical Co., weigh in with their advice on preparing for the current flu season, and dealing with other common winter illnesses. Facilities overrun with germs Bastian and Welch listed rhinovirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and strep throat as the most common winter illnesses, with the addition of COVID-19 in recent years. “Winter illness spikes for a few reasons but mainly because cold temperatures force people indoors for large gatherings,” said Welch. He explained that reduced airflow in buildings due to closed windows and doors can keep germs trapped inside. “As activities and gatherings move inside, this creates an ideal environment for bacteria and viruses to spread on surfaces in shared spaces,” added Bastian. “More time inside means more of a chance for these germs to cause illness.” As people gather in facilities with reduced airflow, viruses and bacteria easily spread from person to person through respiratory droplets, contaminated surfaces, and the air. “When someone coughs, sneezes, or talks, germs spread and many end up on nearby surfaces,” said Bastian. “As we spend more time inside and touch hot-spot items like doorknobs, light switches, chairs, and tables, we’re more likely to come in contact with germs and also contribute to their spread.” Welch stressed that it isn’t necessarily the winter season that is responsible for the spread of germs, but rather the indoor conditions. “Germs spread in the same way, no matter what time of year it is,” he said. “They can be airborne, foodborne, and waterborne, and [spread] from potentially contaminated surfaces.” Cleaning practices to the rescue Bastian suggested that facilities take a three-step approach in their plan to prevent the spread of bacteria and viruses via contaminated surfaces: Ensure effective and efficient cleaning and disinfecting protocols are in place, including clear directions for who cleans and disinfects which spaces, at what time, and with what products. Make the most of your disinfectants by implementing a targeted approach. “I recommend doing this by focusing daily cleaning and disinfection efforts on high-touch surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks,” Bastain said. “Also focus on high-traffic areas—for example, classrooms, restrooms, break rooms, and frequently-used conference rooms.” Choose the right disinfectant for each space, making sure your selection includes products that are registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to kill pathogens of concern. “I also recommend products that are ready-to-use as they eliminate the dilution step, making disinfecting more efficient, which is especially important in resource-constrained environments,” said Bastian. In busy public places, Welch recommends focusing on increased cleaning instead of disinfection. His reasoning is that disinfection only works in a controlled environment when the disinfectant is allowed to remain on the surface for the contact (also known as dwell) time listed on the product label. Following the recommended contact time is not always practical in a busy setting. Instead, frequent, quick cleanings will help remove germs on surfaces that are quickly re-contaminated. “Keep adequate stock of cleaners that are suited for the surfaces being cleaned,” Welch said. “Most importantly [have] a well-trained staff [that knows] how to properly clean the facility.” Clearing the air In addition to focusing on surface pathogens, Welch and Bastian advised facilities to consider strategies to prevent the airborne spread of germs. Bastian recommends that facility managers encourage respiratory etiquette, such as coughing and sneezing into a tissue or your elbow. Both stressed the importance of frequent handwashing and the use of hand sanitizer. “Keep soap and paper towel dispensers filled,” Welch said. Don’t overlook your facility’s HVAC systems. “The best thing a facility can do is make sure their HVAC systems are up to date with maintenance and are turning over a proper air exchange,” Welch said. The CDC recommends aiming for five or more air changes per hour (ACH). This can be achieved through a combination of air exchange through a central ventilation system, natural ventilation, and additional devices that provide equivalent ACH to existing ventilation. Year-round protocols As we enter flu and cold season, the experts agree that, ideally, facilities should not need to ramp up their cleaning and disinfection efforts. “During flu season, times of increased illness, or during outbreaks, it is best to rely on your disinfection plan versus closing the facility or implementing extra cleaning and disinfection procedures,” said Bastian. “If you are using products effective in killing the virus or bacteria of concern, routine cleaning and disinfecting protocols should be sufficient.” “Germ don’t take vacations,” said Welch. “Facilities should have a solid cleaning and maintenance program year-round. Think about a kitchen; should the kitchen relax its sanitation procedures because it’s a certain time of year? I hope not!” Bastian said facility mangers can monitor the number of influenza cases in their area by reading updates from their local health departments along with the CDC’s flu activity and surveillance report, FluView, which it updates every week during flu season. Another CDC resource is the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System, NREVSS, a laboratory-based system that monitors circulation patterns of RSV, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), respiratory adenoviruses, human coronavirus, rotavirus, and norovirus. Facility managers can use the information in these reports to ensure they have cleaning products on hand that are effective against the pathogens responsible for the illnesses in their area, Bastian said. They can also keep watch for illnesses among building residents and employees, who ideally have paid sick leave. Welch offered common-sense, yet often ignored, advice: “If you’re sick, stay home!” Posted On October 27, 2023 Kathleen Misovic Managing Editor for CMM Kathleen Misovic is managing editor for CMM.

Bird flu hits Antarctic region for first time Scientists have expressed concerns that the outbreak could spread to Antarctica and devastate penguin and seal populations. By TZVI JOFFRE OCTOBER 24, 2023 04:40 Two Brown Skuas and a wary Gentoo Penguin at Godthul, South Georgia, British Overseas Territories, UK. (photo credit: Liam Quinn/Wikimedia Commons) Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (bird flu) was detected in brown skua birds on Bird Island on Sunday, marking the first cases of the virus detected in the Antarctic region and raising concerns of potential harm to penguin and seal populations.Bird Island, located about 1,700 km off the southern tip of Argentina, is part of the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The island is also claimed by Argentina as part of the Tierra del Fuego Province.The British Antarctic Survey stated that it took samples from some birds on the island after reports of potentially symptomatic birds and unexplained mortality. The samples were sent to the UK’s Animal and Plant Health Agency where they tested positive for bird flu. The British Antarctic Survey did not say what subtype of the virus the birds were infected with, although it did note that the birds were likely infected by birds who had returned from their migration to South America.A large number of bird flu outbreaks have been reported in Europe and the Americas, including in South America. The main subtype circulating is the H5N1 subtype, although an outbreak of H7N6 was also recently reported in South Africa. Test tubes labelled ''Bird Flu'' and eggs are seen in this picture illustration, January 14, 2023. (credit: REUTERS/DADO RUVIC/ILLUSTRATION)The British Antarctic Survey operates two research stations in South Georgia, including one on Bird Island. Research teams at the island have begun taking precautionary measures and have suspended the majority of field work involving animal handling. The teams are also conducting enhanced cleaning of clothing and field equipment and observing areas of high wildlife density.“It is not possible to forecast the impacts of HPAI across South Georgia, given that the patterns of transmission and mortality in Europe and the Americas space has been highly variable. GSGSSI and BAS will continue to work together to monitor the impact of the wildlife at Bird Island, and the potential spread to other areas,” said the British Antarctic Survey. Bird flu could devastate penguins and seals in AntarcticaIn September, scientists expressed concerns that the outbreak could spread to Antarctica and devastate penguin and seal populations.Dr Jane Rumble, OBE, told The Telegraph at the time that “It could be absolutely devastating. We’re saying when, not if.”“Animals tend to concentrate together. Some sites will have gentoo penguins, chinstrap penguins, elephant seals, fur seals, and they’re all basically together,” added Rumble, explaining that the dense colonies could help the virus spread. “Their natural predators are in the water, so they don’t avoid each other on land.” Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now Since 2021, Europe and the Americas have been suffering from a nearly continuous outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza which has been described as "the largest-ever" outbreak on the three continents. The virus has affected tens of millions of birds and thousands of mammals across the world.Amid the continuing global outbreak, a number of outbreaks have been reported in Israel.The first outbreak of the season was reported at a petting zoo including over 200 peacocks, geese, ducks, guinea fowls, chickens, doves, and parakeets in Sde Ya'akov in northern Israel. Since then, two additional cases have been reported, including an outbreak at a chicken coop containing 20,000 birds at Allonim in northern Israel, not far from Sde Ya’akov. The second case was reported on October 10, when a black stork was found to be infected at Ein HaMifratz between Haifa and Acre.Before the outbreak in Sde Ya’akov, the last case of bird flu reported in Israel was in April, when an Armenian gull was found dead at the Habonim Beach Nature Reserve, north of Zichron Ya'akov.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags Israel United Kingdom antarctica Virus bird flu Hot Opinion Change the climate: Israel’s environmental potential at COP29 and regional impact By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

Pfizer and other vaccine makers like Moderna and Novavax believe combination shots will simplify the process for people to protect themselves against respiratory viruses that typically surge around the same time of the year.In this articleBNTXPFEFollow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNTCFOTO | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesPfizer on Thursday said its combination vaccine candidates targeting Covid and the flu will move to a final-stage trial in the coming months after showing positive initial results in an early to mid-stage study.That moves the pharmaceutical giant and its German partner BioNTech one step closer to winning a potential regulatory approval for a combination shot for Covid and the flu. Earlier this year, Pfizer said it hopes to launch a vaccine targeting those two respiratory viruses in 2024 or later.Pfizer and other vaccine makers like Moderna and Novavax believe combination shots will simplify the process for people to protect themselves against respiratory viruses that typically surge around the same time of the year."This vaccine has the potential to lessen the impact of two respiratory diseases with a single injection and may simplify immunization practices," Annaliesa Anderson, Pfizer's head of vaccine research and development, said in a release. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said during an investor call earlier this month that he believes the convenience offered by combination vaccines will "unlock a significant potential by improving the vaccination rates." Covid vaccine rates in the U.S. were bleak last year, and could look the same this year.The trial measured the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Pfizer's combination vaccine candidates among adults ages 18 to 64. The trial also compared the combination vaccines to a licensed influenza vaccine and Pfizer's bivalent Covid shot, which targets the omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5 and the original strain of the virus. The results showed that "lead" formulations of Pfizer's combination vaccine demonstrated robust immune responses to influenza A, influenza B and Covid strains, according to Pfizer. The safety profiles of the combination vaccine candidates were also consistent with the company's Covid vaccine.Pfizer and BioNTech are also developing a vaccine that targets both Covid and RSV. Meanwhile, both Moderna and Novavax are developing their own combination shots.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

The first cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza have been confirmed in skua populations in Antarctica. Kneonlight/iStockphoto/Getty Images CNN — The first cases of bird flu have been detected in seabirds in the Antarctic, according to the British Antarctic Survey, raising fears the disease will spread rapidly through dense colonies of birds and mammals. “Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has been confirmed in brown skua populations on Bird Island, South Georgia – the first known cases in the Antarctic region,” the British Antarctic Survey said in a statement Monday. South Georgia is part of the British overseas territory east of South America’s tip and just above Antarctica’s main landmass. The British Antarctic Survey believes the birds carried the disease on their return from migration to South America. In August this year, OFFLU – an open network of global avian influenza experts – warned of a “substantial risk” of a southward spread of the HPAI H5 virus from South America, where it was first detected in October 2022. In a report published August 23, OFFLU warned that the disease could reach Antarctica and its offshore islands “due to the spring migration of wild birds from South America to breeding sites in the Antarctic.” It pointed to “immense” negative impact on the Antarctic wild birds and mammal population due to “their likely susceptibility to mortality from this virus, and their occurrence in dense colonies of up to thousands of pinnipeds and hundreds of thousands of birds, allowing efficient virus transmission.” Bird flu is caused by infections that occur naturally among wild aquatic birds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infected birds can transmit the virus to other animals through their saliva and other bodily discharges. Antarctica and its offshore islands are home to “more than 100 million breeding birds, six species of pinnipeds and 17 species of cetaceans,” according to OFFLU, which warns of the possibility of “efficient virus transmission” in the region. One of the key objectives of OFFLU, which was founded jointly in 2005 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Organisation for Animal Health, is to gather data on the viruses and analyze disease patterns. The British Antarctic Survey, which is responsible for the UK’s national scientific activities in Antarctica, operates two research stations on South Georgia, including one at Bird Island where the confirmed cases were identified. These unprecedented cases come as several countries have experienced record outbreaks of bird flu this year. In Japan, just under 10 million birds were killed to limit the spread of the disease, putting strain on the supply of poultry and sending the price of eggs soaring.

WHO/Europe recently launched a seasonal campaign to protect populations and health systems against the cumulative impact of these circulating viruses. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is now one of several circulating respiratory viruses, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and continues to present a serious public health risk. WHO/Europe is implementing a transition plan that includes several shifts and expansions in the approach to collaborative surveillance for COVID-19, influenza and other respiratory infections. Changes in testing, genomic characterization and reporting across many countries mean that reported data on COVID-19 cases need to be interpreted with caution. Indicators from a range of established systems such as sentinel surveillance in primary and secondary care, and novel systems such as wastewater monitoring, provide a better understanding of the intensity of transmission, disease severity and viral evolution of these viruses. Additionally, systems measuring intensive care unit occupancy, hospital bed occupancy and excess all-cause mortality across age groups will support country planning and estimates of the burden of disease. As part of this change, WHO/Europe has made several changes to its respiratory virus surveillance and data reporting systems. Reflecting some of these changes, WHO/Europe and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have launched the weekly European Respiratory Virus Surveillance Summary (ERVISS). The new online platform displays integrated surveillance data for influenza, COVID-19 and RSV in the WHO European Region, including the European Union/European Economic Area. ERVISS will also contribute to the new WHO/Europe COVID-19 Information and Data Hub, a comprehensive resource that provides links to the most current health information, datasets and products related to COVID-19. Dr Richard Pebody, WHO/Europe’s Programme Area Manager for Infectious Hazard Management, explained the move. “We have been working for some time with Member States as they move their respiratory surveillance systems from pandemic mode to a more routine, sustainable, integrated approach, combining COVID-19 with other respiratory viruses. Together with ECDC support, we have provided guidance to Member States across the Region on what those national surveillance systems should look like.” Dr Pebody continued, “This will help countries to better implement those public health and social measures which are common to some of these viruses, plan hospital bed capacity and implement vaccine programmes more holistically.” He added, “Surveillance systems at a national level should be focused on well designed, representative national sentinel monitoring in primary and secondary care, but should also include a mosaic of complementary data systems to ensure a full and integrated virologic and epidemiologic picture. Pre-pandemic, only influenza was vaccine-preventable, but surveillance is even more important now, to monitor activity for planning coronavirus vaccines and soon-to-be-introduced RSV vaccines.” The ERVISS system objectives are to: monitor the intensity, geographical spread and temporal patterns of influenza, COVID-19 and other respiratory virus infections to inform optimal mitigation measures; keep track of severity and risk factors for severe disease, and assess the impact on health-care systems of these infections to inform mitigation measures; observe changes and characteristics of circulating and emerging respiratory viruses, particularly virological changes in influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, to inform the development of treatments, drugs and vaccines; and replace 3 existing regional products: Flu News Europe, the WHO/Europe Weekly COVID-19 Surveillance Bulletin, and the COVID-19 Situation in the WHO European Region dashboard. The Information and Data Hub will also include WHO/Europe’s Public Health and Social Measures Monitoring platform and the WHO/Europe COVID-19 Vaccine Programme Monitor, as well as databases on COVID-19-related health information that will continue to be accessible for historical reference. These systems are critical to ensuring that respiratory viruses are monitored optimally and together to guide timely, appropriate, holistic control and prevention measures. They will also be key in the detection and monitoring of future pandemics. Dr Catherine Smallwood, WHO/Europe’s COVID-19 Incident Manager, said, “The COVID-19 Situation in the WHO European Region dashboard played a pivotal role in providing essential information during the early stages of the pandemic. However, the landscape of this has now shifted, and so have data needs. This is why the creation of the new Information and Data Hub is so important. This will be developed and expanded to cover future health threats.” Related COVID-19 Information and Data HubEuropean Respiratory Virus Surveillance Summary (ERVISS) News With the international public health emergency ending, WHO/Europe launches its transition plan for COVID-19 12 June 2023 Events Keeping safe from COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) this autumn and winter.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been confirmed in brown skua populations on Bird Island. (Image credit: Richard Phillips) Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), a particularly lethal form of bird flu, has been detected in birds in Antarctica for the first time.Researchers with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) made the discovery after investigating reports of illness and unexplained deaths among seabirds on Bird Island, an island in the South Atlantic off the northwest tip of South Georgia that houses a BAS research station. To find out what was sickening the animals, the researchers took clinical samples from the birds there and sent these off for analysis. Swabs from brown skuas (Stercorarius antarcticus) revealed the animals had a type of bird flu called HPAI H5N1, according to a statement released Monday (Oct. 23)."Whilst the source of the disease on Bird Island is not certain, it is likely that it was introduced via skuas returning from their migration in Argentina where there are known to be a high number of cases," the BAS statement noted. An ongoing H5N1 outbreak that began in 2022 has killed seabirds around the world, and the infection has also spilled over to mammals, the statement added.H5N1 primarily infects domestic birds, including chickens and turkeys, and various wild birds, such as ducks and geese. In 2022, it drove devastating outbreaks on U.S. bird farms. It sometimes infects mammals, including cats, mink, foxes, seals and sea lions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). On rare occasions, people can catch H5N1, the CDC considers it a low risk to public health because it's never been found to spread between people.Related: Ultra-rare, deep-diving whale dies on New England beach with possible case of bird fluA number of brown skuas have caught H5N1, raising concerns that the infection could continue to spread among the birds and then on to additional animals. (Image credit: Richard Phillips)The new cases of H5N1 detected among Bird Island skuas raise concerns for local wildlife."There are species on some of the Antarctic islands and sub-Antarctic islands that are unique to those islands, and only occur in small numbers, in hundreds or thousands," Thijs Kuiken, a veterinary pathologist at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, told New Scientist. "If the virus reaches those populations, they are in threat of extinction."Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Slow-breeding birds such as penguins and albatrosses could also face major losses, he noted. If, say, 50% to 70% of a breeding colony dies off, "it will take years, if not decades, for these populations to return to their previous levels," he said.RELATED STORIES—UK's first human case of H5N1 avian flu detected in man with pet ducks—50 amazing facts about Antarctica—Hidden, never-before-seen penguin colony spotted from spaceIn August, Kuiken and other avian flu experts warned that H5N1 would likely soon spread to the Antarctic region from South America, and now their prediction has seemingly come true. Because the region has never seen an outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu, scientists fear the isolated wildlife there may be hit particularly hard, The New York Times reported in August. (Other types of bird flu have sickened birds in Antarctica before, but not HPAI.)So far, at least 30 birds on Bird Island have been killed by H5N1, BAS staff told New Scientist.

Video Ad Feedback Don't believe this about the flu 01:21 - Source: CNN CNN — While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older should receive the annual flu vaccine, most people haven’t – at least not yet. Only 22.7% of adults and 20.8% of children have gotten the flu shot this fall, according to CDC data from October 14. Why is it important for everyone eligible to receive the flu shot? How effective is it? Do people who have had the flu before still need a shot? Why is it necessary every year? When is the best time to get it? And what else should people do to stay healthy as the weather gets colder? To help us with these questions, I spoke with our CNN Wellness medical expert, Dr. Leana Wen. Dr. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner. CNN: Is it too late to get the flu shot? Dr. Leana Wen: Not at all. Flu season has not peaked yet. Pharmacies and many doctors’ offices will offer the flu shot, so call ahead and schedule your shot. Many pharmacies don’t require appointments, but some might. If you have a doctor’s appointment coming up, you could probably get your shot then, although you should confirm that they have the flu shot available. Your place of work or local health department might offer shots, too. It’s fine to receive the flu vaccine from any of these place — just don’t delay getting it. Sicked Asian woman measuring her body temperature while having a video conference with the doctor. Luke Chan/E+/Getty Images How do you know if you are still contagious after an illness? A doctor explains CNN: Is there any advantage to waiting until later, when flu season does peak? Wen: You should not wait. It’s best to receive the vaccine before the peak of flu season, which usually occurs between December and March. The flu is already circulating, though, and you could get infected ahead of peak season. If you receive the vaccine now, it will last through this year’s flu season. CNN: Why is it important for everyone who is eligible to receive the flu shot? Wen: The flu can be dangerous, and the flu vaccine has two important positive effects. The first is to reduce the chance of severe illness. According to studies cited by the CDC, vaccinated patients had a 26% lower risk of intensive care unit admission and a 31% lower risk of death from the flu compared to unvaccinated individuals. In the 2019-2020 year, the flu vaccine prevented an estimated 105,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations. The second reason to get the flu vaccine is to reduce infection. Each year, the exact effectiveness depends on how well the vaccine developed matches the strains in circulation, but it’s generally 40% to 60%. That’s significant on both a personal and individual level. Being sick with the flu, even if it doesn’t result in hospitalization, can be miserable. People can have fever, fatigue, achiness and cough for a week or longer. Kids can miss school and adults miss work and other responsibilities. I get the flu vaccine every year, and I make sure that my husband and two children do too, because we want to reduce the possibility of illness due to flu. In addition, being vaccinated helps to reduce the risk of infecting others around us, which is crucial to me as a healthcare provider who takes care of vulnerable patients. Young woman suffering from cold sebra/Adobe Stock Scientists finally know why people get more colds and flu in winter CNN: Do people who have had the flu before still need a shot? Wen: If you had flu in years past, then yes, you do still need to receive the flu vaccine this year. The immunity you developed before wanes. Also, many people might say that they’ve had the “flu” when they really had a cold or another viral infection. I hear from my patients that they don’t need the flu vaccine this year because they’ve already had “the flu” but they never actually tested positive for influenza. Having another virus does not protect you against influenza, and you still need to get the flu shot. CNN: Why is a flu shot necessary every year? Wen: The flu shot is recommended on an annual basis for two reasons. First, waning immunity means that the protection from last year’s flu shot won’t carry you through this year’s flu season. Second, the strains of the flu in circulating vary. Every year, the shot is targeted to the strains that are predicted to be most dominant. CNN: When is the best time to get the shot? Wen: Late September to early October is ideal. This is before peak flu season, and the effectiveness will last through the winter. CNN: What else should people do to stay healthy as the weather gets colder? Wen: Be sure to also get your updated Covid-19 vaccine. This could be done at the same time as you get the flu shot. If you are 60 and older, speak with your healthcare provider about getting the new RSV vaccine. Bandage after applying vaccine andreswd/E+/Getty Images Why people who qualify should get the RSV vaccine CNN: Is there anything else people should consider besides shots? Wen: Good hand hygiene is important. Wash your hands often. Use hand sanitizer after touching commonly used public surfaces like door handles and elevator buttons. Some individuals may choose to mask when in indoor crowded settings. Now is also a good time to optimize your overall health. Get your annual checkup. Make sure your other chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, are under control. And get plenty of sleep, eat nutritious foods, and aim to reduce your stress.

The test swabs were processed by the UK’s Animal and Plant Health Agency laboratories before returning the results the researchers had already feared.While HPAI has mostly been in the headlines around the globe for its impact on commercial poultry production, migratory birds pose the biggest threat to spreading the virus around the globe and creating opportunities for it to evolve and spill over into other groups such as mammals.The gull-like Antarctic brown skua most likely contracted HPAI in Argentina, which is along their migratory route through South America, where there have been significant outbreaks in wild birds and also seals.Naturally, the BAS – which has a research station on Bird Island – has suspended field work that involves animal handling, and is closely monitoring other seabird colonies.While scientists cannot be certain HPAI hadn’t already arrived in Antarctica, it’s notoriously difficult to monitor in wild bird populations. Bird Island was a likely contender for where it would appear, however; the seabird colonies on the three-mile (4.8-km ) long stretch of land are some of the most closely monitored populations in the world.The island is an important base for scientific research, as it’s home to 50,000 breeding pairs of penguins, 650,000 pairs of fur seals, as well as large, diverse populations of seabirds. The island is free of rats, which encourages small burrowing birds to use the island as a breeding haven, but it’s also a refuge for a large number of endangered species. As such, the spread of HPAI across the small island could have devastating consequences.It’s also devastating news for the brown skua population, with recent research suggesting the predatory species, which feeds on other seabirds, has undergone a 47% decline in the last five years, with the cause largely unknown but most likely nest predation, kleptoparasitism and prey competition.The current outbreak of HPAI – H5N1 – which began gathering speed in late 2021, has likely killed millions of wild birds, but the nature of monitoring transmission means official numbers are just the tip of the iceberg.While still a virus primarily spread among birds, spillover into mammals such as seals, minks and other wildlife – and when transmission did not occur through scavengers eating infected carcasses – there’s ongoing cause for concern.Essentially now a panzootic, a non-human pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has flagged that an increasing number of mammalian infections poses a risk to humans."With the information available so far, the virus does not appear to be able to transmit from one person to another easily, but vigilance is needed to identify any evolution in the virus that can change that,” said Dr Sylvie Briand, Director of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention, WHO.Source: British Antarctic Survey Tags Infectious DiseasesBritish Antarctic Surveyavian-influenzaBirdsEpidemiologyVirusInfluenza Facebook Twitter Flipboard LinkedIn No comments Bronwyn Thompson Bronwyn has always loved words and animals, and she has the journalism and zoology degrees to prove it.

These are the first identified cases of avian influenza in the Antarctic. Researchers have previously expressed concern about the devastating impact an outbreak could have on many wildlife species in the Antarctic. Government and research teams in the area are taking action to monitor and limit the disease's spread, including putting most animal handling work on hold. Avian influenza, or bird flu, has been around for a long time. But HPAI H5N1 has one recently emerged as a highly pathogenic strain, becoming a subject of global concern over its high mortality rates. Potentially symptomatic birds and unexplained deaths were reported to the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), so staff on Bird Island collected samples for analysis, and HPAI H5N1 was detected.Brown skua (Catharacta antarctica) on Bird Island, South Georgia. (Richard Phillips)Since the current outbreak of H5N1 HPAI began, huge numbers of seabirds have died throughout North and South America, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as in the southern part of Africa. Numerous species of seabirds, penguins, and other birds live in the Antarctic, many of which are not found anywhere else on Earth. These birds are frequently densely populated, and have limited natural immunity to avian influenza due to a lack of historical exposure, making them extremely vulnerable to infection. Earlier this month, Antarctic research teams announced they were implementing extra measures like protective clothing and masks when working close to seabirds to avoid transmitting the highly contagious virus to wildlife themselves. Infected birds' droppings, feathers, and respiratory secretions spread avian influenza so the virus could quickly travel from Bird Island to the rest of the Antarctic region, resulting in widespread outbreaks and massive bird deaths. Despite being primarily a virus of avian hosts, the current outbreak has also affected mammals in both land and sea environments. A risk assessment published in September by the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network indicates skuas, gulls, fur seals, and sea lions are most at risk of HPAI infection. Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) on Bird Island are already facing population decline due to lack of food that appears to result from rising sea temperatures.Antarctic fur seal pups (Arctocephalus gazella) on Bird Island. (Adam Bradley)The return of birds from their migration to South America, where there are a large number of HPAI cases, is likely what carried the virus to Bird Island. Large outbreaks have been reported in both Chile and Peru since HPAI arrived in South America, and it has spread over 6,000 kilometers in as little as three months, following the Pacific coast of South America to its southernmost tip off Tierra del Fuego. More than 20,000 sea lions and over half a million seabirds have died in Peru and Chile alone as a result of HPAI H5N1. This virus has recently spread to the Atlantic coast of Argentina, with cases discovered in sea lions all the way from Tierra del Fuego to Buenos Aires. Although waterfowl, gulls, and shorebirds play a central role in the avian influenza viral cycle in the wild, the virus appears to be easily transmitted between different species of birds. Whether or not the virus is harmful to them depends on the virus strain and the bird species. Because of their ability to fly great distances – migratory birds can easily spread viruses between countries. One way the virus spreads is when farm birds come into direct contact with wild birds, which can lead to healthy birds being culled to contain an outbreak. And infections in poultry are often associated with cases appearing in humans. Human infections from bird flu viruses are extremely uncommon, though the World Health Organization (WHO) states, "Studies are underway to identify any changes in the virus that may help the virus to spread more easily among mammals, including humans." Authorities are monitoring the outbreaks closely and providing advice and updates. The CDC explains, "the current risk to the public from HPAI H5N1 viruses remains low." More than 898 human infections with HPAI H5N1 have been recorded since 1997, sometimes causing severe illness and death. That doesn't mean HPAI H5N1 can spread among us from a human case.Viruses are complex, and as the WHO reports, "sustained human-to-human transmission of the viruses from these cases is currently considered unlikely."

The full impact of the virus’s arrival is not yet known, but scientists are raising concerns about possible “catastrophic breeding failure” of the region’s fragile wildlife populations.The virus was found in populations of a scavenging bird called brown skua on Bird Island, which is part of the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. These migratory birds probably brought it with them from South America where bird flu is widespread and has already killed an estimated 500,000 seabirds and 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru alone.The current outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1 – which started in 2021 – is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds. Researchers have long been concerned about its potential impact on Antarctic wildlife, because many species are found nowhere else in the world, and are not known to have been exposed to bird flu viruses before.Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) took swabs of the birds when they found unexplained mortality and sent them for testing in the UK.Ashley Bennison, the BAS science manager for Bird Island, said: “This is a particularly sad event to confirm. We will continue to monitor the species on the island as best as we can and keep the science going, but we are unsure of the full impact at the moment.”Bird Island is considered one of the planet’s richest wildlife sites, home to many endangered bird species as well as 50,000 pairs of breeding penguins and 65,000 pairs of fur seals. The island lies just off the north-west tip of South Georgia, about 600 miles south-east of the Falkland Islands.Wild birds gain immunity to avian flu in ‘encouraging sign’ amid deadly outbreakRead moreA risk assessment on the impacts of bird flu reaching the continent, published by Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, said fur seals, sea lions, skuas and gulls were the most at risk, followed by penguins, birds of prey, sheathbills and giant petrels.Dr Meagan Dewar, the chair of the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network – who was the lead author of the report – said that the disease could result in “catastrophic breeding failure” in the region, with a “devastating impact on many wildlife species”.The report states that “ongoing disease surveillance programmes should be established to identify new and emerging pathogens”.H5N1 spread almost 4,000 miles down South America in the space of three months, facilitated by migration routes of wild birds. The fact it had already spread down South America made it likely it would arrive in South Georgia at some point, researchers say.As a result of the positive tests on Bird Island, most field work that involves animal handling has been suspended. Staff will have to be extra vigilant about ensuring they have clean clothing and field equipment.The news follows recent research that showed some seabirds in the UK – where the outbreak was first reported – are starting to show immunity to H5N1.Explore more on these topicsBird fluThe age of extinctionAntarcticaBirdsAnimalsWildlifeHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyAntarctic temperatures rise 10C above average in near record heatwave1 Aug 2024Scientists discover hidden landscape ‘frozen in time’ under Antarctic ice24 Oct 2023Science Weekly‘We’ve lost control’: what happens when the west Antarctic ice sheet melts? – podcast24 Oct 2023Antarctica has lost 7.5tn tonnes of ice since 1997, scientists find12 Oct 2023Antarctic sea ice shrinks to lowest annual maximum level on record, data shows26 Sept 2023Australian government backflips on cancellation of Antarctica penguin surveys8 Sept 2023Fears over Antarctic sea ice as yearly ozone layer hole forms ‘very early’8 Aug 2023Small wonder: brothers launch model boats to circumnavigate Antarctica17 Jul 2023‘Extreme situation’: Antarctic sea ice hits record low15 Feb 2023‘Polar Preet’ aims to become first woman to trek solo across Antarctica16 Jul 2022Most viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

AstraZeneca image of FluMist. AstraZeneca CNN — Sicked Asian woman measuring her body temperature while having a video conference with the doctor. Luke Chan/E+/Getty Images How do you know if you are still contagious after an illness? A doctor explains The US Food and Drug Administration is reviewing an application for the nasal spray flu vaccine FluMist to be able to be self-administered at home, drugmaker AstraZeneca said Tuesday. The vaccine, the only nasal spray option against flu, has been on the market in the United States since 2003. AstraZeneca has asked the FDA to allow adults ages 18 to 49 to be able to give themselves the vaccine, or to give it to children as young as age 2, citing a “usability study” showing people can do it properly without a health care provider present. If approved, it would be the first flu vaccine cleared for self-administration. Patients would still need to go through an online pharmacy system to order the vaccine, which would then be shipped to their home in temperature-controlled packaging, AstraZeneca’s Dr. Lisa Glasser told CNN. The hope is that a self-administered flu vaccine option could increase uptake; while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends everyone age 6 months and older get a seasonal flu vaccine every year, fewer than half of Americans get vaccinated. “One of the things we’ve learned from the pandemic is that actually people can do things for themselves, they can take maybe more responsibility for their own health care in their own hands than perhaps we realized or even thought possible,” Glasser, AstraZeneca’s head of US medical affairs, vaccines and immune therapies, said in an interview. During the Covid-19 pandemic, she noted, “we put nasal swab tests in people’s hands and they used them successfully.” The FDA is expected to make a decision about whether to clear FluMist for self-administration in the first three months of next year, AstraZeneca said. If the FDA OKs the change, AstraZeneca said FluMist would be available for self-administration in the 2024-2025 flu season. It would still be available through traditional channels as well, administered at the doctor’s office or pharmacy, Glasser said. Young woman suffering from cold sebra/Adobe Stock Scientists finally know why people get more colds and flu in winter Physicians welcomed the news a flu vaccine could become more accessible, but didn’t expect a potential approval for self-administration would change vaccination rates significantly. “If this would increase compliance, that would be fantastic,” Dr. Aaron Glatt, chief of infectious diseases and hospital epidemiologist at Mount Sinai South Nassau, told CNN. Documentation would be crucial, though, said Glatt, also a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America — so that patients don’t accidentally get the vaccine more than once, or say they received it without actually having had it. Glasser said AstraZeneca will provide a way to make documentation “practical and helpful for not only for the patient, or the person, but also for their health care professionals,” though she said it was too early to provide details. The online ordering system will also provide a way to ensure the vaccine isn’t used by people who shouldn’t take it, Glasser said. The CDC notes FluMist is not indicated for anyone with a weakened immune system and only for people ages 2 to 49. FluMist uses a live, weakened version of the influenza virus to provide protection against the flu, while injectable versions use different technology — either killed viruses or proteins to train the immune system to fight off the virus. AstraZeneca says FluMist has shown to be as effective as other flu vaccines.

Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown School of Public Health and the former White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said a self-administered flu vaccine option could be even more accessible if it were available to buy on pharmacy shelves, rather than through a gatekeeper. But he noted as many as 10 to 15% of people may be needle-phobic and hesitant to get vaccines, so increasing ways to access a needle-free version could boost uptake. If the FDA clears the change, he said, “I think the impact is going to be modest.” But he said he hoped it to would lead to increased awareness, potentially through more marketing from AstraZeneca, or more research into additional intranasal vaccines that are easier to get. “I see this as a relatively positive step.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)The British historical drama program Downton Abbey has captivated audiences all over the world with its stories of the trials and tribulations of an aristocratic family, their servants, and the fate of their eponymous estate. Many of those stories, rooted in relationships and melodrama, transcend the boundaries of time. But the show also contains dozens of references to real-life events, from the sinking of the Titanic setting the plot in motion to a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it reference to the infamous Charles Ponzi, of the original Ponzi scheme. Read on to find out about seven real moments in history that Downton dealt with—briefly or at length.Reader beware: spoilers ahead.The Spanish Fluinfluenza pandemic of 1918–19: temporary hospitalA temporary hospital in Camp Funston, Kansas, during the 1918–19 influenza pandemic.Courtesy of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, D.CFans of Downton’s dramatic Mary-and-Matthew saga will no doubt remember the tragic death of sweet Lavinia Swire, who basically gave up the ghost to avoid an awkward love triangle. What you might not know is that Lavinia fell victim to a notorious illness—the “Spanish flu” pandemic of 1918–19. That outbreak was not your average bug. It was one of the most lethal in human history. Some researchers estimate that it killed up to 50 million people. Lady Grantham was really lucky to have made it out of that episode alive.BloomersbloomersA Currier & Ives rendition of the bloomer costume influenced by Amelia Jenks Bloomer.Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. (digital. id. cph 3b49861)Impossible to overlook are Downton’s amazing period costumes. In season one, Lady Sybil causes a kerfuffle when she debuts a new outfit that includes bloomers, or “Turkish trousers”—a major step toward wearing the pants in the family. Although that semi-scandal takes place in 1913, bloomers were in fact popularized circa the 1850s in the United States. Usually worn under skirts, bloomers provided freedom of movement that women in that time period seldom had, allowing women to participate in sports and ride bicycles without worrying about indecent exposure. The symbolic nature of wearing bloomers furthered women’s rights movements, especially in the U.S.The SketchFictional Lady Edith falls in love with the equally fictional Michael Gregson, a magazine editor, after he invites her to write a column for him in his publication, The Sketch. What fans might not know, however, is that The Sketch was a real magazine. It was published in the U.K. from 1893 until 1959. As Downton depicts, much of the magazine’s content focused on high society and aristocracy, and the writing staff did indeed include several women. Notably, The Sketch was the first magazine to publish the short stories of the inimitable Agatha Christie.EclampsiaChildbirth is dangerous, even with today’s medical advancements. It was even worse 100 years ago, when Lady Sybil tragically fell victim to eclampsia and left her husband widowed with a newborn. Eclampsia and its more-common precursor, preeclampsia, were known to even the ancient Greeks and still killed thousands of women in Sybil’s time. However, unlike the doctors in Downton, doctors in the early 20th century did administer medication to control seizures, which might have been able to save Sybil’s life. Nowadays doctors and midwives measure pregnant patients’ blood pressure and test their urine to diagnose and treat preeclampsia before it can become eclampsia, and many more women are saved. But preeclampsia and eclampsia aren’t just history. They are still problems for some eight million women globally every year and too often still result in maternal death. Auguste EscoffierEscoffierH. Roger-ViolletIn season four, footman Alfred Nugent embraces his love of the culinary arts and applies to a cooking program at the swanky Ritz Hotel. Savvy viewers may note that this program is in honor of the chef Auguste Escoffier, better known as the “king of chefs and chef of kings” or the father of modern French cuisine. Escoffier gained fame while working at hotels in London, although not at the Ritz. He was known for his cookbooks and for his use of seasonal ingredients as well as his organizational skills in high-volume (and high-profile) kitchens. Escoffier worked as a chef for more than six decades—an impressive tenure even today. During that time he created the dish “peach Melba” in honor of the famous singer Nellie Melba, who makes an appearance on Downton in the same season.Beer Hall PutschBeer Hall PutschNazi paramilitary troops participating in the Beer Hall Putsch, November 9, 1923.Bundesarchiv, Bild 146-2007-0003 / CC-BY-SAWho can forget the overwhelming suspense about the fate of poor Michael Gregson? Would he ever get to meet his illegitimate child? Alas, Gregson was killed in an encounter with a man who needs no introduction, Adolf Hitler. The event described in Downton was an actual scuffle called the Beer Hall Putsch (Bierkeller Putsch), in which Hitler and his Nazi Party followers forced their way into a political meeting in a beer hall in Munich and attempted to stage a coup. Unfortunately, the event was somewhat of a debutante ball for Hitler, who was at that time not very well known. He made front-page headlines, was sentenced to prison, and sat down to write Mein Kampf. After he was released from prison, Hitler went about gaining power through legitimate means instead.The King’s SpeechGeorge VGeorge V broadcasting a Christmas greeting to the British Empire from the royal mansion in Sandringham, Norfolk, England, 1935.Hulton Royals Collection—Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesIn season five, the ever-fashionable Lady Rose convinces Lord Grantham to buy a wireless radio, patented in the late 1800s and popularized in the early 1900s by Guglielmo Marconi. Lord Grantham is swayed only when he learns that King George V will be giving a broadcast speech at the opening of the British Empire Exhibition in April 1924. That was a real event and indeed the first time many British citizens—and others across the globe—got to hear the voice of the monarch. Although perhaps now not as famous as the speech reenacted by Colin Firth in the Academy Award-winning film The King’s Speech, fans of that film may recognize the venue as the site of the future George VI’s painfully halting embarrassment at the beginning of the movie, which happened there in 1925.

The vaccine contains four influenza virus strains and is recommended for individuals above the age of 2. It aims to provide superior protection against influenza and enhance vaccination rates by offering a more comfortable and accessible option. The vaccine is currently available in private markets in India. Serum Institute of India. File photo PUNE: City-based Mylab and Serum Institute of India (SII) have launched Nasovac S4, Indiaâs first needle-free nasal influenza vaccine.The vaccine will be available through a network of healthcare providers and clinics across India. Nasovac S4 is a live quadrivalent influenza vaccine containing four influenza vaccine virus strains, aligning with WHO recommendations.A statement issued by Mylab Discovery Solutions said that the vaccine includes two influenza Type A virus strains (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and two influenza Type B virus strains (Victoria and Yamagata lineage).Indicated for individuals above the age of 2, Nasovac S4 actively immunizes against influenza caused by these virus strains. This nasal spray flu vaccine initiates action in the nasal passages, stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies against influenza infection. A single intranasal dose of Nasovac S4 is recommended for people above two years of age.The statement further added that the conventional method of administering influenza vaccines through injections can often deter individuals, especially children, and those with trypanophobia (fear of needles). Influenza remains a highly contagious respiratory infection with the potential for severe complications, particularly during seasonal outbreaks. Vaccination stands as the primary defence against influenza, and Nasovac S4 not only offers superior protection but also strives to enhance vaccination rates by providing a more comfortable and accessible option.The vaccine is currently available in the private markets and only in India. Speaking at the launch of the vaccine, Hasmukh Rawal, managing director of Mylab Discovery Solutions, said, âWith exclusive distribution and marketing partnership between Mylab and SII, we aim to provide comprehensive protection against a wide range of influenza strains.âDr Rajeev Dhere, executive director, Serum Institute of India, and virologist, said, âThis vaccine is different from the currently available vaccines since it is nasal and needle-free. It has a two-pronged approach as it works at the respiratory tract and in the blood. It works right at the systemic level and on the local level as well, where the infection can occur, at the nose, and in case any virus enters the system it provides protection there as well. It provides protection against all four variants of influenza.âWe also published the following articles recentlyVaccine that offers protection against three deadly coronavirus types has shown promise in mouse trialsResearchers at Duke Human Vaccine Institute have developed a vaccine that protects against three different fatal coronaviruses, potentially allowing for pan-coronavirus immunization. The vaccine, tested on mice, successfully protected against SARS-CoV-1, MERS coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The vaccine consists of a single nanoparticle loaded with a key fragment from each of the coronaviruses. The researchers plan to conduct human tests next year with a version that targets different SARS-CoV-2 strains. The development of a universal coronavirus vaccine is considered a global health priority.Scientists infect volunteers with Zika in hunt for vaccines, treatmentsResearchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health have successfully infected human volunteers with the Zika virus in a controlled study. The study, deemed safe and scientifically important by regulators, aims to learn more about the disease and develop vaccines and treatments. Zika, a viral infection spread by mosquitoes, can be dangerous for pregnant women and foetuses, causing birth defects. With no vaccines or treatments available, the study is seen as a crucial step in combating the virus. The next step is to evaluate the virus in male volunteers to understand how long it remains infectious in semen.This World Polio Day, let us not be complacent in the maintenance of a polio-free environment: Preeti Futnani, General Manager, Vaccines, Sanofi (India)India successfully eliminated polio and received Polio-free certification from the World Health Organization in 2014. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed challenges to maintaining high immunization coverage rates. While access to polio vaccines has improved, there are still millions of unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children globally. India has shown improvement in routine immunization coverage rates, but it is crucial to prevent any backsliding on childhood vaccinations, including polio vaccination. Strategies such as nationwide immunization days and recommended vaccine schedules are important to sustain India's polio-free status and protect children from the disease.About the AuthorSteffy ThevarSteffy Thevar is a Pune-based senior correspondent working for the Times of India.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved Cold & Flu Treatment Prescription Medications for Colds or Flu By Naveed Saleh, MD, MS Updated on October 23, 2023 Medically reviewed by Mary Choy, PharmD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Antibiotics Antihistamines/Decongestants Antivirals Cough Medicines Decongestants Nasal Sprays Close Most people don't need prescription medicine to treat the common cold or influenza. The first line of treatment for these viral infections is self-care: fluids, rest, and over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Severe upper respiratory tract symptoms, though, may benefit from prescription drugs. Antiviral medications can help to shorten the duration and reduce symptoms of the flu and COVID-19, for example. Antibiotics may be needed to treat a bacterial infection. Other prescription cold medicines include antihistamines, cough medicines, and nasal sprays. This article discusses prescription cold medicine and other treatments for upper respiratory tract infections. Hero Images / Getty Images When to See a Doctor for a Cold or Flu Antibiotics The common cold, influenza, and COVID-19 are viral infections and cannot be treated with antibiotics. However, sometimes what you think is a cold can be a bacterial infection. A respiratory virus can set the stage for a secondary bacterial infection. Bacterial infections require treatment with antibiotics. Bacterial infections that may affect the upper respiratory tract include acute otitis media, bronchitis, epiglottitis, pneumonia, and strep throat. If you have one of those infections, your healthcare provider may prescribe the following antibiotics: AmoxicillinAugmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate)CefdinirCefpodoximeClindamycinDaxbia (cephalexin)DoxycyclineCephalexinPenicillinSuprax (cefixime) Zithromax (azithromycin) Why You Don't Need Antibiotics for a Cold or the Flu Antihistamines Antihistamines work by blocking the release of histamine, a natural substance our bodies release when exposed to allergens. Antihistamines are also used to treat cold symptoms. Antihistamines are widely available over the counter and included in combination cold medicine. Sometimes, your doctor may prescribe an antihistamine to relieve cold and flu symptoms. Prescription antihistamines include: Atarax (hydroxyzine)Cyproheptadine (generic only, formerly Periactin) Karbinal ER (carbinoxamine)Ryvent (carbinoxamine)Vistaril (hydroxyzine) These are all first-generation antihistamines, which commonly cause drowsiness. They are similar to OTC drugs Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and Triaminic (chlorpheniramine) and may help you sleep when you're stuffed up. Newer antihistamines like Claritin (loratadine) and Zyrtec (cetirizine) do not cause drowsiness and are better for daytime use. These second-generation antihistamines are available without a prescription. Do Antihistamines Relieve Cold and Flu Symptoms? Most cold and flu medicines contain antihistamines. However, there isn't a lot of evidence to support their use. A 2015 study found antihistamines may ease cold symptoms on the first or second day. After that, though, antihistamines do not appear to offer any benefits for cold and flu symptoms. Should You Take Allergy Medications for a Cold? Antivirals Antivirals are medications that specifically target viruses in an effort to prevent them from reproducing. Your healthcare provider may prescribe antiviral medications if you have influenza or COVID-19. Antivirals can help shorten the duration of a viral illness, reduce symptoms, and prevent complications. They are most effective when taken within 48 hours of symptom onset. Antivirals approved to treat influenza include: Oseltamivir (generic) Rapivab (peramivir) Relenza (zanamivir) Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) Antivirals approved to treat COVID-19 include: Lagevrio (molnupiravir)Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir)Veklury (remdesivir) While anyone can be prescribed antivirals, they are especially important for people at high risk of complications. This includes people who are older, immunocompromised, obese, or have other comorbidities. Cough Medicines Coughing is a common (and often annoying) symptom of respiratory infections. It is your body's natural way of clearing your airways and preventing pneumonia. As such, it is not necessary to treat a cough unless it disrupts your ability to sleep or work. Cough medicines come in two forms: Cough suppressants, like OTC dextromethorphan, help to quiet a cough.Expectorants, like OTC guaifenesin, break up chest congestion, allowing you to cough it up. If OTC cough medicines do not relieve your cough, your healthcare provider may prescribe something stronger, such as: An albuterol inhaler like Proventil or ProAir to treat a wheezing coughBalminil DM (dextromethorphan)Tessalon (benzonatate), a non-narcotic cough suppressant (not safe for children younger than 10) Other prescription cough medicines contain opioids. Codeine and hydrocodone treat severe coughs by preventing the brain from triggering the cough reflex. They are often used in combination with antihistamines and decongestants. Prescription cough medications that contain either codeine or hydrocodone include: Codeine/phenylephrine/promethazine (generic) Codeine/promethazine (generic)Hydrocodone/homatropine (generic)Tuxarin ER (codeine/chlorpheniramine)Tuzistra XR (codeine/chlorpheniramine)Vituz (hydrocodone/ chlorpheniramine)Zutripro (hydrocodone/chlorpheniramine/pseudoephedrine) Cough medicines that contain codeine or hydrocodone should only be used for short-term treatment of a severe cough. They are not approved for use in children and should not be used during breastfeeding. Misuse of narcotic cough suppressants can lead to addiction, overdose, or death. The Dangers of Prescription Cough Medicine Decongestants Decongestants work to ease cold and flu symptoms by causing blood vessels to constrict. This helps dry up a runny nose and relieve a stuffed-up nose. Decongestants are sold over the counter as Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) and Sudafed PE (phenylephrine) and are found in combination cold medicines. They are often taken along with antihistamines or cough suppressants to relieve cold symptoms. There are currently no prescription decongestants on the market in the United States. Pseudoephedrine-containing products are sold "behind the counter" because they can be used to make methamphetamine drugs. As a result, many cold medicines contain phenylephrine instead. However, a Food and Drug Administration panel has concluded that phenylephrine isn't effective as a decongestant when taken orally. Decongestants should not be given to children under 6. For children ages 6 to 12, check with their healthcare provider first. What Are Decongestants? Nasal Sprays Nasal sprays are an effective way to deliver medication to the source of your cold symptoms. Medications in nasal sprays include corticosteroids, antihistamines, and decongestants. OTC nasal sprays can often help treat congestion and a runny nose from a viral respiratory infection. These include: Afrin (oxymetazoline)Astepro (azelastine)Flonase (fluticasone)Nasacort (triamcinolone)NasalCrom (cromolyn sodium)Neo-Synephrine (phenylephrine)Rhinocort (budesonide) If OTC nasal sprays do not bring relief, your healthcare provider may prescribe a combination nasal spray, such as: Dymista (azelastine/fluticasone) Patanase (0lopatadine)Ryaltris (olopatadine/mometasone)Q-Nasl (beclomethasone diproprionateZetonna (ciclesonide) Using Nasal Steroids Summary The common cold and flu can often be treated at home with rest, plenty of fluids, and OTC medications. Sometimes, however, what you think is a cold, flu, or viral infection is more serious and requires prescription medications. If you suspect you have the flu or COVID, ask your healthcare provider if prescription antiviral medications may be right for you. These often need to be started within the first two days of symptoms. Other prescription medications used to treat colds and upper respiratory symptoms include antibiotics (for bacterial infections), antihistamines, cough medicine, and nasal sprays. If you are concerned a cough is something more serious than a common cold virus or your cold symptoms are worsening, see your healthcare provider. You may need a prescription to help you feel better.

Photo: Jelly Tse“I would ask Hongkongers to be extremely careful for the coming winter since it will be the first one where people are not required to wear masks,” Ko told a television programme, referring to the city dropping its face covering mandate on March 1.“People, children in particular, will be more vulnerable as they have not been exposed to any major flu virus in the past three years.”The authority chief said he expected the number of infections to reach a high level, given physical contact between people had increased, adding the city saw a similar surge in cases in the summer after social-distancing curbs were lifted.Hong Kong girl, 5, dies from flu complications“So I would urge Hongkongers to get vaccinated as soon as possible since the jab usually takes several weeks to take effect,” Ko said, adding the period before the beginning of the winter season was a “golden time” for residents to get inoculated.The Centre for Health Protection, which falls under the Department of Health, on Saturday said it was investigating the case of the 16-year-old boy, who remained in serious condition. The patient was healthy in the past and had no travel history during the incubation period.He developed a runny nose last Thursday and was found unconscious on Saturday. He was sent to Tuen Mun Hospital where he was found to have a fever and suffered convulsions.The Centre for Health Protection is investigating two cases of severe influenza A in Hong Kong teenagers.

The clinical diagnosis was paediatric influenza infection complicated with encephalopathy,” the centre said.The centre was also investigating a case of a 15-year-old girl with severe flu. She had been in good health and had no travel history during the incubation period before testing positive for influenza A (H3).She experienced fever and a sore throat on Saturday and was admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital on the same day.Hong Kong pandemic adviser warns of peak in Covid-19 cases soonThe centre said the clinical diagnosis was paediatric influenza infection complicated with shock, but her condition had improved and she remained stable after treatment.“Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even healthy persons. Seasonal influenza vaccination is one of the most effective means to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications, as well as reducing influenza-related hospitalisation and death,” a centre spokesman said.A person infected with both the flu and Covid at the same time could develop more serious symptoms and face a higher risk of death, he said, urging children and the elderly in community or residential care homes in particular to get vaccinated against both infections as soon as possible.The Hospital Authority’s efforts to retain talent in public healthcare has stabilised the turnover rate and increased the number of medical workers. Photo: Xiaomei ChenAuthority chief Ko said the summer flu season had subsided from its peak, alleviating some of the pressure on the public healthcare system.The overall occupancy rate at public hospitals had decreased to about 90 per cent, but some hospitals had recorded a relatively high number of patient visits during different times of the day, he added.He also said the authority’s efforts to retain talent in public healthcare, such as through raising salaries and improving the work environment, had stabilised its turnover rate and led to an increase in the number of medical workers.But Ko stopped short of revealing how many workers were needed to plug the shortage of personnel.Sign up for the YP Teachers NewsletterGet updates for teachers sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicyCommentSign up for YP WeeklyGet updates sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicySign up for YP WeeklyGet updates sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy Policydiscovernewslifestyleentertainmentadviceyour voicevideoscmp.comLearnreportTEAM YPjournalism resourceslatest reportslearnlearning resourcescollege & uni lifecareer adviceeventssparkStoriesWorksheetstrending topicsHKDSE - Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary EducationHealth and fitnessEnvironmentalLivingRelationshipsStudent lifeCareersEnglish exercisesVideo gamesK-popMental healthCelebritiesMedia literacye-paperYP is a unit of South China Morning Post.SCMPVisit scmp.comAbout UsContact UsWrite for UsPrivacy PolicyTerms & Conditions© 2024 South China Morning Post Publisher Ltd.

The association is more profound when the shots are given at the same time, and in those aged 85 and older. A team at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluated data from Medicare claims to come up with the conclusion. In January, the FDA and the US Centers for Disease Control announced that their safety monitoring study — the Vaccine Safety Datalink — detected a small and uncertain stroke risk in older adults who got a Pfizer COVID-19 shot and a flu shot in the same day. The FDA said the risk is small, and is about three strokes or transient ischemic attacks per every 100,000 doses given. The mechanism behind the increased risk may be the high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines, because they’re made to trigger the immune system so it responds better to the shot. There’s also a slightly higher risk of stroke in people 65 and up who receive a high-dose flu vaccine, Medicare claims data revealed. That equates to about one or two strokes for every 100,000 flu shots. “The absolute risk is miniscule,” Steve Nissen, MD, a cardiologist and researcher at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, said. “I mean it is trivial in comparison to the risk for people over 85 of dying from COVID.” Other research hasn’t found a higher risk for stroke after receiving a COVID-19 shot, flu shot, or both. “Available data do not provide clear and consistent evidence of a safety problem for ischemic stroke with bivalent mRNA Covid-19 vaccines when given alone or given simultaneously with influenza vaccines,” said Tom Shimabukuro, MD, director of the CDC’s Immunization Safety Office. People should still get vaccinated, researchers say. William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said spreading out vaccines is the “reasonable thing to do.” In September, experts said that getting the vaccines at the same time was safe and effective.

Read our privacy policyJapan is observing a serious shortage of generic flu medicine amid the spread of influenza and Covid-19, finds a report.The number of flu cases per medical institution in Japan exceeded the warning level earlier this week, reported The Japan Times.The health ministry, which collects flu reports from about 5,000 medical institutions nationwide, predicted a possibility of a major flu outbreak within a month.With the announcement on Sunday, the ministry is now scrambling to sort out structural issues affecting the drug industry that has led to a shortage of generic medication in the country.The country has shut down 10 generic drugmakers since 2021 due to quality issues, said the ministry, according to The Japan Times. The Covid pandemic and the spread of influenza further led to a shortage of supply, reported the outlet.RecommendedJapan's Kishida plans an income tax cut for households and corporate tax breaksSouth Korea, US and Japan hold first-ever trilateral aerial exercise in face of North Korean threatsSpain's royals honor Asturias prize winners, including Meryl Streep and Haruki MurakamiThe supply of cough medications has gone down by 15 per cent, said the ministry. This comes as the country increased the warning level for flu and closed or partially closed a total of 1,772 schools.The spread of flu in the season is also a cause of concern because it usually spreads in winter.“Several factors are believed to have played a role in the current spread of the flu, including a decline in immunity as (the flu) had not spread for a long time, and an increase in travel between Japan and overseas,” a health ministry official was quoted as saying by the outlet.The official advised residents to continue efforts to prevent infection as they did for Covid.More aboutCovidInfluenzaCOVID-19FluJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesCommentsMost PopularPopular videosSponsored FeaturesGet in touchContact usOur ProductsSubscribeRegisterNewslettersToday’s EditionInstall our appArchiveOther publicationsInternational editionsIndependent en EspañolIndependent ArabiaIndependent TurkishIndependent PersianIndependent UrduThe StandardExtrasAdvisorPuzzlesAll topicsBetting OffersVoucher codesCompetitions and offersIndependent AdvertisingIndependent IgniteSyndicationWorking at The IndependentLegalCode of conduct and complaintsContributorsCookie policyPrivacy policyUser policiesModern Slavery StatementThank you for registeringPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged inFirst cases of avian flu found in Antarctic region डाउन टू अर्थPrint EditionSubscribeHealthAgricultureWaterWasteClimateAirAfricaData CentreVideoGalleryYoung EnvironmentalistBookshopNewslettersSubscribeHealthAgricultureWaterWasteClimateAirAfricaData CentreVideoGalleryYoung EnvironmentalistBookshopNewsletters Wildlife & BiodiversityFirst cases of avian flu found in Antarctic regionResearchers identify species and areas most vulnerable to spread of infectionA skua, a predatory seabird of the Antarctic region. They have been primarily affected by the bird flu outbreak. Photo: iStockHimanshu NitnawarePublished on: 27 Oct 2023, 6:08 amCopiedScientists have detected the presence of avian flu for the first time in the Antarctic region, raising concerns for remote populations of penguins and seals.The findings by researchers from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) followed reports of several “potentially symptomatic birds and unexplained mortality” and further tests confirmed the presence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influence (HPAI).The HPAI was detected in brown skua (a predatory seabird) populations on Bird Island, South Georgia, making it the first known case in the Antarctic region.The researchers, in their findings presented in Biological Risk Assessment of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in the Southern Ocean, said the malaise had possibly reached the region from South America.Based on trends observed in Europe, North America and South Africa, scientists fear HPAI may lead to a decline in the breeding populations of vulnerable fragile wildlife residing in the region.The viral disease HPIA or avian influenza, especially the H5 and H7 strains, mostly affects birds. These strains are highly pathogenic and have been reported in domestic poultry, resulting in high mortality if they manage to reach wild bird populations.The virus is known to spread among birds and mammals due to predators and scavengers feeding on infected birds. In recent cases, marine mammals have also been found to be infected.The ongoing outbreak of HPAI H5N1 was first reported in 2022. The scientists stated in the report that in July 2022, outbreaks were reported in the Northern Hemisphere’s wildlife, especially seabirds. This heightened fears that the pestilence might spread to Southern Ocean seabird populations as well.In 2022 and 2023, HPAI H5N1 spread rapidly in South America. Fears regarding southern birds came true when a team from the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network investigated and found the infection had spread in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic region.Last year, the virus spread along the Pacific coast of South America, affecting populations in Peru and Chile. It travelled 6,000 kilometres towards the continent’s southernmost tip — Tierra del Fuego — in three months, impacting 500,000 seabirds. It also caused significant outbreaks in marine mammals, leading to the deaths of 20,000 South American sea lions.A press statement by BAS stated: BAS and Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) remain vigilant for further cases and science and visitor programmes are currently continuing under enhanced biosecurity measures. It added that BAS is working in close partnership with the GSGSSI, guided by their tiered response plan to monitor and manage the outbreak.According to the researchers’ risk assessment, the most threatened avian group are gulls and skuas. They are followed by birds of prey such as hawks and caracaras, terns and shorebirds.Among marine mammals, fur seals and sea lions are reportedly most vulnerable, followed by southern elephant seals and dolphins.The researchers also found that, “sub-Antarctic slands between southernmost tip of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula with the Falkland Islands are at most risk.” The risks are significantly high due to the presence of other vulnerable wildlife groups.WorldSouth AmericaAvian Flubird fluAntarcticaBirdsAvian flu outbreakAntarcticFalkland Islandfalkland islandsShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

Indo-Asian News Service Follow on Twitter | Published: 24th October 2023 7:38 pm IST Representative image New Delhi: The World Health Organization (WHO) recently advised a reversion to trivalent (three-strain) influenza vaccines for the 2024 southern hemisphere influenza season that typically begins in April. This will likely reshape the global influenza vaccine market for the upcoming seasons, according to a report. The WHO recommendations came amid the influenza season that is underway in the northern hemisphere when vaccination campaigns are in full force. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) has delivered its fastest ever rollout of influenza vaccine, with a record 10 million people already vaccinated with quadrivalent (four-strain) vaccines such as AstraZeneca’s Fluenz Tetra and Viatris’ Influvac Tetra. The WHO recommendations for the northern hemisphere is expected to follow suit. “The WHO is expected to make the same trivalent composition recommendation for the upcoming influenza seasons in the northern hemisphere. The earliest we can expect to see this changed recommendation would be February 2024, in preparation for the 2024-2025 northern hemisphere influenza season,” Stephanie Kurdach, Infectious Disease Analyst at GlobalData, a data and analytics company, said in a statement. The recommendation to upgrade trivalent vaccines, which provide protection against two strains of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and one strain of influenza B, to quadrivalent vaccines, which also incorporate a second influenza B strain, coincided with the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere influenza season and the 2013 southern hemisphere influenza season. However, one decade later, the WHO is recommending the removal of the B/Yamagata lineage antigen from quadrivalent vaccines, with every effort made to exclude this component as soon as possible, as there have been no confirmed detections of circulating B/Yamagata lineage viruses after March 2020. “When the actual composition of vaccines will revert to trivalent formulations remains another question. This is no small undertaking for vaccine manufacturers. Estimated transition timelines are expected to vary and could take up to 36-48 months,” Kurdach said. In a recent meeting held by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), concerns were cited regarding the proposed composition change included regulatory challenges, manufacturing challenges, and the risk of re-emergence of the B/Yamagata virus lineage. In addition to the challenges faced by the currently marketed influenza vaccines, the proposed composition change will also affect the seasonal influenza vaccine development pipeline. According to GlobalData, the seasonal influenza vaccine pipeline consists of 153 products in active development, and 53 vaccines currently in Phases I-III. Of these, only one is denoted as a trivalent vaccine — The Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals’ IVACFLU-S. IVACFLU-S has been licensed in Vietnam since 2019 but is undergoing additional clinical testing to expand the approved patient populations. “There is still much uncertainty surrounding the exact course of action needed for vaccine manufacturers to transition and supply trivalent vaccines. Nonetheless, these updated recommendations provide plenty of opportunity for current and future market leaders to re-shape the global influenza vaccine market,” Kurdach said.

PatumbonPublished on: Oct 24, 2023, 5:02 pmCopiedREPORTED cases of dengue, influenza-like illness, and other diseases have increased in the Province of Davao de Oro based on their Provincial Health Office (PHO)- Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Unit. In their weekly status of notifiable diseases under category two from January to September 2023, the number of dengue cases has increased from 118 in weeks one to four, to 421 in weeks 35 to 39. All in all the number of dengue cases has already reached 1,962.Similarly, the distribution of influenza-like illness cases has fluctuated from 225 cases in week one to four, to 180 cases in weeks 35 to 39 with a total number of 1,690 total number cases.In the Facebook post of the Municipal Health Office (MHO) of Mawab, Davao de Oro, they conducted a dengue risk evaluation by going door to door, inspecting houses for potential breeding spots and hiding places of Aedes Aegypti or mosquitoes carrying dengue virus last October 19, 2023. They also conducted a Dengue Awareness Campaign to increase the level of awareness of their constituents. Other diseases on the list are acute watery diarrhea with 1,353 cases and 124 cases of acute bloody diarrhea. The patients afflicted with typhoid or paratyphoid fever have also seen a slight increase in the number of cases with only two in weeks one to four, to 38 cases in weeks 35 to 39 with a total of 119. The number of cases of acute viral hepatitis is 104, while there are 27 cases of leptospirosis, 12 cases of pertussis, and 830 cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). “The PHO authorities, in collaboration with the Municipal Health Offices (MHOs), have teamed closely to prevent the diseases mentioned above in the future. They are also urging the constituents to adopt preventive measures with the goal of promoting a healthy Davao de Oro,” the Province of Davao de Oro wrote in its caption.Meanwhile, PHO Disease Surveillance Coordinator Ma. Dizerine Mae M. Rolida told SunStar Davao in a phone interview on Tuesday afternoon, October 24, 2023 that they are constantly monitoring the number of cases of these diseases in the province and that they advise every resident of Davao de Oro to always listen to the person of higher authorities, especially in updates regarding diseases.“Better nga maminaw gyud ta sa mga higher authorities na mas nakahibalo gani unya dili ta maminaw sa storya sa uban, mao man gyud na ang makadala ug kahadlok. Mas preferred na maminaw tas mga right persons katung naay enough na knowledge (It is better to listen to people in higher authorities that know the situation and to not listen to stories by unreliable individuals because usually, that insinuates fear in the heart of the people. It is much preferred that we listen to the right person who has enough knowledge),” Rolida said.

If you have not had a flu vaccination yet this year, it is a good time to visit your GP or pharmacist to get a shot. While the period of peak influenza circulation is typically June to September in most parts of Australia, influenza can spread all year round. And there is often an uptick in late spring. This year, as covid social distancing measures and precautions have lapsed, there looks to be a resurgence of respiratory illnesses such as flu, RSV, and HMPV. If you had your flu vaccination from mid-April onwards this year you will likely still have immunity, but if you are concerned it is a good idea to talk with your GP. Why should you get a flu vaccine? People living with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing serious complications, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and ear infections, from a bout of the flu as diabetes can impair your immune system. Statistics show that when you have diabetes, you are three times more likely to be hospitalised from the flu and its complications than other people. An illness such as flu can also affect your blood glucose levels and diabetes management. Although illnesses such as the flu generally tend to raise blood glucose levels, sometimes you may become so unwell that you don’t feel like eating and a reduced appetite can cause blood glucose levels to fall. It is important to follow the sick day guidelines if you become ill.

The launch is part of its campaign to promote vaccination and infection prevention under the slogan Stop the Spread, aimed at raising awareness about the importance of preventive vaccinations and their vital role in improving community health. Through this programme, the centre aims to educate about the importance of choosing influenza vaccination for prevention, identifying affected cases and analysing the viral pattern of the disease. This contributes to identifying main strains and taking appropriate preventive measures. The programme reflects the emirate's efforts to provide suitable vaccinations for citizens and residents, enhance effective health prevention and combat infectious diseases. Her Excellency Dr. Farida Al Hosany, The Executive Director of the Infectious Diseases Sector at Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre, said: “This programme aims to provide the community with the necessary knowledge and culture to maintain public health and raise awareness about correct practices that prevent infection. The seasonal influenza programme is a significant addition to the efforts of the Abu Dhabi Public Health Centre in the field of awareness and preventive healthcare. The centre is committed to collaborating with strategic partners to reduce potential complications related to infectious diseases by emphasising the importance of preventive measures, especially as we approach the influenza season. “The centre hopes to enhance vaccination and prevention levels throughout the community, protecting vulnerable people and contributing to public health and general wellbeing in the emirates.” Everyone aged 6 months and above is eligible to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine for free. The vaccine is highly recommended especially among high-risk individuals more susceptible to the disease such as healthcare workers, children younger than 5 years, school-aged children aged between 5-18 years, pregnant women, adults aged 65 years old and above, people with chronic conditions, Hajj and Umra pilgrims as well as smokers. Currently, the flu vaccination is available at 111 health centres including 15 pharmacies, aiming to facilitate the patient experience and provide easy access to the best therapeutic and preventative healthcare services. Recognised as one of the most effective methods of preventing seasonal influenza, vaccines protect against common types of influenza viruses and their components are updated annually to ensure their ability to provide the necessary immunity. The Stop the Spread programme includes three more upcoming awareness campaigns for vaccination, foodborne illnesses and antimicrobials, providing the general public with the knowledge and motivation to make informed decisions on the benefits of preventative care and be part of the drive to protect society.
