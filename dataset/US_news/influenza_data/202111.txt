Deep characterization of these bnAbs and polyclonal sera provides pivotal understanding for influenza immunity and informs effective vaccine design. However, conventional virus neutralization assays require high-containment laboratories and are difficult to standardize and roboticize. Here, we build a panel of engineered influenza viruses carrying a reporter gene to replace an essential viral gene, and develop an assay using the panel for in-depth profiling of neutralizing antibodies. Replication of these viruses is restricted to cells expressing the missing viral gene, allowing it to be manipulated in a biosafety level 2 environment. We generate the neutralization profile of 24 bnAbs using a 55-virus panel encompassing the near-complete diversity of human H1N1 and H3N2, as well as pandemic subtype viruses. Our system offers in-depth profiling of influenza immunity, including the antibodies against the hemagglutinin stem, a major target of universal influenza vaccines.

In addition, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses cause sporadic outbreaks in humans with a high mortality rate, posing potential risk of human adaptation and are considered pandemic threats1. Viral glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) is required for viral entry into the host cell through binding to sialic acid moieties on glycoproteins or glycolipids and mediates fusion of the viral membrane with host endosomal membranes. Another viral glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) cleaves sialic acid and promotes the release of progeny viruses from infected cells. Neutralizing antibodies are primarily directed against HA and can compete for receptor binding, inhibit the membrane fusion machinery, or cause virus aggregation. Antibodies to NA can sometimes have neutralizing activity but are thought to primarily limit virus egress by inhibiting enzymatic activity and release of virus thereby inhibiting viral spread. Based on the genetic and antigenic properties of HA and NA, influenza A viruses are divided into groups 1 and 2, each of which have several subtypes defined primarily by HA. To date, there are 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes identified and characterized2. Currently, strains of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A as well as influenza B viruses co-circulate in humans. In addition, several other subtypes of animal influenza viruses (e.g., H5N1, H6N1, H7N9, H9N2, and H10N8) can also infect humans and occasionally result in mortality. In contrast to influenza A viruses, which have an extensive zoonotic reservoir, influenza B viruses are isolated almost exclusively from humans with a more limited evolutionary history and have diverged into only two genetically and antigenically distinct lineages (Victoria- and Yamagata-like lineages)3.The discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) capable of neutralizing multiple influenza virus subtypes in humans opens an opportunity for developing a universal influenza vaccine, which elicits such antibodies4,5,6. Many of these antibodies target conserved epitopes in the HA stem and neutralize virus by inhibiting the viral fusion machinery, therefore, the activity is not detectable by traditional hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, which measures the ability of antibody to inhibit virus–receptor interaction. Several less broad bnAbs recognize the receptor-binding site (RBS) in the HA head, hence exhibiting HAI activity7. Since most universal influenza vaccine candidates aim to induce protective levels of such bnAb response6,8, comprehensive analysis of the neutralization breadth and potency regardless of HAI activity is crucial to accelerate the efforts to develop effective universal influenza vaccines. The influenza microneutralization (MN) assay has been the most commonly used method to measure neutralizing activity of antibodies against influenza virus9. In this assay, virus replication is measured by either detecting viral nucleoprotein (NP) with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), titrating hemagglutination, or scoring cytopathic effects. Plaque-reduction neutralization assay is also commonly used for influenza and other viruses. These approaches are labor-intensive, not easily scalable, and the handling of live viruses of animal origin requires high-containment laboratories. There is also significant performance variability between laboratories due to multi-step signal amplification or reliance on subjective scoring. Given these inevitable limitations of the current MN assay, there is a need to transform the MN assay to be safe, high throughput, robust, easy to standardize, and automation compatible10.The use of reporter viruses for developing standardized high-throughput neutralization assays has greatly advanced our ability to measure and characterize antibody responses induced by infection and/or vaccination11,12,13. While HA/NA pseudotyped reporter lentiviruses have been constructed for influenza and utilized effectively for measuring neutralizing activity14, they are often criticized for not recapitulating some of the key aspects of influenza viruses, such as viral morphology and HA spike density15,16. Therefore, building influenza viruses with a reporter feature is an attractive alternative. Among several approaches to produce influenza reporter viruses, a replication-competent reporter virus can be developed by fusing a reporter gene to a viral gene (e.g., PA or NS)17. This new virus remains as virulent as the parental virus in animals, making it suitable for viral pathogenesis studies, yet still subject to biosafety precautions. In contrast, single-cycle infectious or replication-restricted reporter (R3) influenza viruses can be generated by replacing one of the viral essential genes (e.g., PB1 or HA) with a reporter gene17,18,19,20. Thereby these R3 viruses are capable of replicating only in cells complementing the deleted viral gene product in trans, making it safe to handle in low-containment laboratories.In the present study, we developed a comprehensive panel of R3 viruses to enable high-throughput and in-depth influenza virus neutralization profiling. We generated a neutralization matrix of 24 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and 55 R3 viruses spanning 6 subtypes of influenza virus and compared the R3 virus-based assay with the gold-standard ELISA-based MN assay9. The reporter virus assay provides a more robust method for probing the breadth of anti-influenza immunity needed for developing universal influenza vaccines.ResultsGeneration of R3∆PB1 virusesThe influenza virus has a segmented genome, which allows its rapid and relatively easy genetic manipulation. Each segment consists of either one or two protein-coding sequences flanked by short noncoding regions (NCRs). The genome packaging signal sequences are located at both 3′- and 5′-termini of each segment encompassing the entire NCRs and part of the adjacent protein-coding sequence. Genome packaging sequences are unique to each segment and required for an efficient incorporation of each viral RNA molecule into the virion. The PB1 segment encodes two proteins: PB1, the main component of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and PB1-F2, translated from the +2 frame and not required for virus replication21. The protein-coding sequence of PB1 (A/WSN/1933, H1N1) has 2,274 nucleotides and is flanked by 24 bases at the 3′- and 43 bases at 5′-termini. In addition to the NCRs, genome packaging signals of the PB1 segment comprise 120 bases of the coding region at both 3′- and 5′-termini18,22 (Supplementary Fig. 1).To build R3 influenza viruses, we altered the PB1 segment by removing the PB1 coding sequence not required for genome packaging and replacing it with the reporter encoding fluorescent protein tdKatushka223. To prevent translation of alternative transcripts from PB1 segments, we mutated potential initiation codons (ATGs) found between the 3′ end and the reporter open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 1a). PB1 is essential for virus replication therefore, R3 influenza viruses in which PB1 was removed (R3∆PB1) can be propagated only in cells expressing the PB1 in trans (Fig. 1b, c). Thus, we used MDCK-SIAT1 cells, which constitutively express human β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (SIAT1)24 to prepare a cell line constitutively expressing PB1 of A/WSN/1933 by transfecting a plasmid encoding a puromycin-resistance gene, PB1, and a self-cleaving peptide derived from Thosea asigna virus 2A (T2A) in between the two genes. The R3∆PB1 virus was rescued by reverse genetics using 8 plasmids encoding HA and NA of wild-type H1N1 or H3N2 influenza A viruses; PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS of A/WSN/1933; and another encoding the reporter. To validate the use of R3∆PB1 viruses for influenza neutralization assays, we also rescued replication-competent H1N1 and H3N2 parental viruses, which possess HA and NA of wild-type viruses and the internal genes including PB1 of A/WSN/1933, and propagated in MDCK-SIAT1 cells (Fig. 1b, c).Fig. 1: Development of replication-restricted reporter (R3) ∆PB1 influenza A virus.a Design of engineered PB1 segment encoding fluorescence reporter tdKatushka2. b, c Rescue of parental wild-type molecular clone (b) and R3∆PB1 (c) viruses using reverse genetics of eight plasmid system with HA and NA segments of virus of interest and internal gene segments of A/WSN/1933. PB1 segment of A/WSN/1933 is used to rescue molecularly cloned parental viruses, while engineered PB1 segment is used for R3∆PB1 influenza viruses. R3∆PB1 influenza viruses require cells expressing PB1 in trans for rescue and propagation.

Electron microscopic experiment was performed once and representative image of each virus is shown.Full size imageTo examine the morphology of R3∆PB1 virus (A/Michigan/45/2015, H1N1), we performed negative stain electron microscopy and found that there was no visible difference in size and spike density between R3∆PB1 and the corresponding wild-type molecularly cloned parental viruses, indicating that the R3∆PB1 virus remains morphologically indistinguishable from its parental virus (Fig. 1d). Virus growth kinetics of the R3∆PB1 (A/Michigan/45/2015) and its parental viruses in MDCK SIAT1 and PB1-expressing MDCK-SIAT1 cells confirmed that the R3∆PB1 virus replicates only in PB1-expressing cells, whereas parental virus replicates similarly in MDCK-SIAT1 cells with or without PB1 expression (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that the R3∆PB1 viruses are replication-incompetent in cells lacking PB1 expression but they replicate comparably in PB1-expressing cells to corresponding parental viruses carrying PB1 with identical HA and NA.Influenza virus neutralization assay using R3 virusWe tested whether the R3∆PB1 viruses can be used in an influenza virus neutralization assay. To do so, neutralization assays were carried out utilizing both R3∆PB1 and parental viruses with matched HA and NA, where we compared the inhibitory concentration of a set of mAbs. To verify the reporter-based readout, the R3∆PB1 virus-infected cells were detected either by ELISA with anti-NP antibody or by fluorescence using an automated image-based plate reader at 24 h post infection. We measured neutralizing activity (80% inhibitory concentration, IC80) detected by both ELISA- and fluorescent reporter-based readouts for several mAbs against a total of 8 R3∆PB1 viruses (4 H1N1 and 4 H3N2 viruses) and found a strong positive correlation (Pearson r = 0.94, p < 0.001) between the two IC80 datasets, demonstrating that the fluorescent reporter-based readout yields comparable neutralization results to conventional ELISA-based detection method (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3).Fig. 2: Assessment of R3∆PB1 virus for neutralization assay.a Correlation between fluorescence- and ELISA-based readouts.

Colors indicate different viruses. Circles and squares represent H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, respectively. Dashed lines indicate upper and lower limits of detection. Pearson r correlation coefficient and two-tailed p values for each analysis are shown above each graph. Neutralization assays were performed at least twice and representative data are plotted.Full size imageTo assess the R3∆PB1 viruses with the MN assay format, we next determined neutralizing IC80 for 6 mAbs against matched pairs of R3∆PB1 and parental viruses (4 H1N1 and 3 H3N2 viruses). Cells infected with R3∆PB1 viruses were detected by fluorescence, while cells infected with parental viruses were detected by ELISA. The positive correlation (Pearson r = 0.87, p < 0.001) between neutralization IC80 of mAbs against R3∆PB1 and parental viruses shows that R3∆PB1 viruses retained the neutralization sensitivity of parental viruses with matched HA and NA (Fig. 2b). In conclusion, our results indicate that the neutralization assay using R3∆PB1 viruses with fluorescence-based readout can be used as high-throughput, safe, and reliable measurement of virus-neutralizing activity.Building a comprehensive panel of R3 virusesWe aimed to build a comprehensive panel of R3∆PB1 viruses spanning the entire antigenic evolution of human H1N1 and H3N2 subtype viruses. We selected representative influenza strains based on phylogenetic analysis of HA sequences deposited in public databases, literatures on genetic and antigenic evolution of human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses, and vaccine strains utilized since 1930s23,25,26,27,28.H1N1 subtype virus was introduced into the human population in 1918 and circulated until it was replaced by H2N2 virus in 1957. H1N1 virus re-emerged in 1977 and circulated until 2009. During this period, H1N1 viruses evolved significantly through genetic drift into multiple clades with distinct genetic and antigenic properties27,29,30,31. To capture the antigenic variations of these viruses, we chose 7 matched HA and NA sequences from viruses circulating between 1933 and 1957 and 13 HA and NA sequences from viruses circulating between 1977 and 2009. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus acquired sustained human-to-human transmission and rapidly and completely replaced the pre-pandemic H1N1 virus. Since its emergence, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus has accumulated several amino acid substitutions linked to changes in antigenicity32. Therefore, we included 3 HA and NA sequences from viruses isolated between 2009 and 2015 and HA and NA sequences of swine-origin A/New Jersey/8/1976 (H1N1), which caused an isolated outbreak in 1976 in the United States. In summary, our H1N1 panel consists of 19 pre-pandemic strains, 3 pandemic strains, and 1 swine-origin H1N1 strain (Fig. 3a). Of note, our panel of H1N1 viruses includes genetically similar viruses to all World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended H1N1 vaccine strains between 1977 and 2015 (fludb.org/brc/vaccineRecommend.spg?decorator=influenza), antigenically representative viruses circulating in humans in the 1940s31, or representatives of the major HA and NA lineages of seasonal H1N1 viruses30.Fig. 3: Phylogenetic and protein surface conservation analysis of HA of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses used in the study.a, b Phylogenetic tree of 24 H1 (a) and 26 H3 (b) HA sequences used in the R3 panel. The tree was generated by NJ method and rooted with A/South Carolina/1/1918 (a) (not used in the study) or with A/Aichi/2/1968 (b). Distance scale bar indicates 1% difference in nucleotide identity. c, d Protein surface conservation of H1 (c) and H3 (d) HA used in the R3 panel and a larger non-redundant representative dataset. Amino acid conservation at each residue was calculated and scored by using the Consurf server (https://consurf.tau.ac.il/) and rendered on the structure of A/California/07/2009 (PDB: 3LZG) (c) and A/Victoria/361/2011 (PDB:4WE8) (d). Conservation at each position was scored 1–9 (lowest to highest) and colored according to the conservation score on one protomer of HA trimer. Two other HA protomers are colored in gray.Full size imageH3N2 subtype virus has been circulating in humans since its emergence in 1968. Comprehensive genetic and antigenic analysis of human H3N2 viruses groups them into 14 distinct antigenic clusters21,26,28,33, and hence, we include several representatives from each antigenic cluster in our panel. Sporadic outbreaks with swine H3N2 variant (H3N2v) have also been described in humans34. Therefore, we included the swine-origin H3N2v strain, A/Indiana/10/2011. As a result, our H3N2 panel includes 25 human H3N2 strains and 1 H3N2v strain (Fig. 3b).When we calculate the conservation of solvent-exposed surface among H1 and H3 HAs included in our panel, we notice that the head region of HA of both H1 and H3 is substantially more variable while the stem region is mostly conserved as expected (Fig. 3c, d). The degree of surface conservation reflects that of much larger datasets of H1 and H3 HAs (Fig. 3c, d), suggesting that the selected HA sequences in our R3 virus panel capture the HA diversity of human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses.Generation of R3∆HA viruses with highly pathogenic influenza virus sequencesWorking with highly pathogenic influenza viruses (e.g., H5N1, H7N9, 1918 H1N1) or influenza lineages disappeared from human population (e.g., H2N2) requires high containment laboratories. Although R3∆PB1 viruses have limited capacity to replicate due to the requirement of PB1 complementation, they retain the ability to reassort the HA segment with wild-type influenza viruses. To prevent this event, we evaluated alternative approaches less susceptible to reassortment and generated reporter viruses expressing HA and NA of viruses with pandemic potential19,35.First, we developed influenza viruses, unable to reassort HA segments, by making “rewired” R3∆PB1 viruses (R4∆PB1) as previously described35. For this purpose, two segments of influenza genome were altered: the PB1 segment was modified to encode HA, and the HA segment was modified to encode the tdKatushka2 reporter. Using these altered PB1 and HA segments and reverse genetics, we were able to rescue R4∆PB1 A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2) virus in PB1-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). By measuring neutralizing IC80 of 15 mAbs for both R3∆PB1 and R4∆PB1, we found a strong positive correlation (Pearson r = 0.94, p < 0.001) between IC80 neutralizing activity against the two viruses, demonstrating that these viruses have equivalent neutralization sensitivities (Supplementary Fig. 4d). Moreover, we found that the R4∆PB1 A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2) virus did not reassort its HA segment with A/Solomon Islands/03/2006 (H1N1) when the two viruses were co-infected and propagated on PB1-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. 4e). Although these results show that R4∆PB1 viruses can be safely rescued and used for high-throughput neutralization assay, further work is required to optimize the rescue and the propagation of R4∆PB1 to be a practical and deployable process for producing reporter viruses.Next, we explored an alternative approach to rescue R3 viruses unable to reassort the HA segment by replacing the HA coding sequence with the reporter gene (R3∆HA). In this configuration, the virus lacks a functional HA segment and is unable to reassort the segment with other viruses (Fig. 4a–c), and it will be able to replicate only in HA-expressing cells19. To assess R3∆HA viruses for the reporter neutralization assay, we generated R3∆HA A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2) virus to compare the neutralization IC80 of several mAbs against both R3∆PB1 and R3∆HA viruses. There was a positive correlation between neutralization IC80 determined with these viruses (Pearson r = 0.90, p < 0.001), although we noticed slight differences in sensitivity to neutralization when testing anti-stem antibodies against R3∆PB1 and R3∆HA viruses (Fig. 4d). Using this approach, we prepared 6 R3∆HA viruses (i.e., 2 H5N1 of clade 1, A/Vietnam/1203/2004, and clade 2.1.3, A/Indonesia/05/2005, 2 genetically and antigenically related H7N9, A/Anhui/01/2013 and A/Shanghai/02/2013, 1 H2N2, A/Singapore/1/1957, and 1 H10N8, A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346-2/2013) in addition to the 49 R3∆PB1 virus panel36,37.Fig. 4: Development of R3∆HA influenza viruses.a Design of HA segment used to rescue R3∆HA virus. b R3∆HA virus requires cells expressing HA protein in trans for rescue and propagation. c Non-viable reassortment between R3∆HA and wild-type influenza viruses.

Correlation between neutralization titers of 15 monoclonal antibodies against R3∆PB1 and R3∆HA of A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 H3N2 is shown. Each square indicates titers (IC80 µg ml−1) of a single monoclonal antibody against R3∆HA (y-axis) and matched R3∆PB1 viruses (x-axis). Dashed lines indicate upper and lower limits of detection. Neutralization assays were performed at least twice and representative data are plotted.Full size imageCharacterizing influenza responses in serum samples from human vaccinees using R3 virusesTo assess neutralization activity in polyclonal sera using R3 viruses, we measured the neutralization titers in samples collected in the Phase I human clinical trials of experimental H5N1 and H7N9 vaccines conducted by the Vaccine Research Center in 2011 and 2015, respectively (NCT01086657 and NCT02206464, respectively). Briefly, healthy adult volunteers were immunized with DNA encoding H5 (A/Indonesia/05/2005) or H5N1 monovalent influenza vaccine (MIV), or DNA encoding H7 (A/Shanghai/02/2013) HA, H7N9 MIV, or combinations of H7 DNA and H7N9 MIV followed by a boost with H5N1 MIV or H7N9 MIV, respectively38,39. Neutralization titers were measured at the time of vaccination (week 0) and 2 weeks post-boost against vaccine-matched strain (i.e., H5N1 A/Indonesia/05/2005 or H7N9 A/Shanghai/02/2013 R3∆HA), two H1N1 R3∆PB1 (A/Michigan/45/2015 and A/New Caledonia/20/1999), and two H3N2 R3∆PB1 (A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 and A/Shangdong/9/1983) viruses. For individuals vaccinated with the H5 prime-boost regimen38, we found that neutralization titers against the vaccine strain H5N1 A/Indonesia/05/2005 increased at 2 weeks post-boost from a baseline reciprocal IC80 GMT of 727.8 [range 206.6–1603.5] to a final reciprocal IC80 GMT of 33,014.2 [range 3235.7–223,905.4] (p < 0.0001). We also observed a significant increase (p = 0.0003) in the reciprocal IC80 titers against H1N1 A/Michigan/45/2015 virus (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Similarly, for individuals vaccinated with the H7 prime-boost regimen39, we found that titers against H7N9 A/Shanghai/02/2013 virus had increased significantly upon vaccination (from a baseline reciprocal IC80 GMT of 246.9 [range <40–1192.1] to 3134 [range 765.2–31,285.8] (p = 0.0013). Of note, the H7 prime-boost regimen did not increase significantly neutralization titers against two H1N1 nor two H3N2 viruses tested in any of these individuals (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Together, these results establish that the neutralization assay using R3 viruses can be used to measure the influenza virus-neutralizing activities in human polyclonal sera.Measurement of the viral inhibitory activity of anti-NA antibodies using R3 influenza virusTo assess the viral inhibitory activity of anti-NA antibodies, we adapted our assay using the R3 viruses by adding a thixotropic overlay and quantifying the virus-infected area (i.e., fluorescent plaques). Broadly cross-protective anti-NA mAb 1G0140 and murine anti-NA mAb CD641 inhibited virus propagation in a concentration-dependent manner while non-targeting mAb D25 (anti-respiratory syncytial virus)42 had no effect on propagation of R3∆PB1 A/California/07/2009 H1N1 viruses (Supplementary Fig. 6). These results suggest that our fluorescent plaque-reduction assay with influenza R3 viruses allows live, high-throughput measurement of viral inhibitory activities targeting NA and will facilitate the characterization of novel vaccine candidates and mAbs with anti-NA responses.Profiling of influenza neutralizing mAbs with a 55-virus panelUsing our comprehensive panel of R3 influenza viruses spanning 6 different influenza A subtypes, we profiled the neutralization breadth and potency of a total of 24 human mAbs. Thirteen of them were isolated at the Vaccine Research Center from peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected as part of the H5N1 or H7N9 vaccine clinical trials39,43,44,45, while 11 other antibodies were previously described elsewhere46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55. Among 24 antibodies, 18 antibodies recognize epitopes on the conserved HA stem region and 6 antibodies (i.e., CH65, 5J8, C05, F045-092, F005-126, and 310-33-1F04) bind within the HA head region. HA stem-binding 315-53-1A07 which did not neutralize any of the viruses was included in our panel. Of note, neutralization IC80 values of the mAbs did not change drastically between 18 and 24 h after infection while the virus-infected cells dramatically increased during this time period (Supplementary Fig. 7), providing a reasonable flexibility for assay operation and fluorescent readout. We generated a matrix of neutralizing profiles for 24 antibodies against 55 R3 viruses consisting of 1320 data points and analyzed the matrix by hierarchical clustering (Fig. 5). Despite the fact that there is no associated information about viruses in the input dataset, the profile matrix segregates not only groups of viruses but also virus subtypes into defined clusters (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the hierarchical clustering groups several antibodies according to their immunogenetic composition or convergent antibody class44,56,57. For example, MEDI8852 is clustered with 2 other antibodies (315-53-1F12 and 315-53-1B06) and all the three antibodies belong to the VH6-1 + DH3-3 convergent multi-donor class57, while CR9114 is clustered with CR6261 and 315-02-1H01, which all shares VH1-69. The latter case is particularly noteworthy as CR9114 has much broader neutralizing capacity than the other two, yet clustered with the stereotypical group 1-specific VH1-69 antibodies CR6261 and 315-02-1H01 (Fig. 5).Fig. 5: In-depth neutralization profiling of influenza monoclonal antibodies.Heatmap of neutralization titers (IC80 μg ml−1) of 24 monoclonal antibodies against a panel of 55 R3 influenza A viruses. Virus subtypes are color-coded and indicated at the bottom of the heatmap. Open and closed circles indicate specificity of monoclonal antibodies and are shown on the right of the heatmap (open, HA head-; closed, HA stem-directed). Convergent classes of bnAbs with specific gene signatures are indicated on the left of the heatmap as triangles (gray, VH1-69; black, VH6-1 + DH3-3; open, VH1-18 QxxV). Heatmap and unsupervised clustering was made with the ClustVis server (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/clustvis/). Note: H1N1 and H3N2 viruses are R3∆PB1 and all other viral subtypes are R3∆HA viruses. Neutralization assays were performed at least twice and representative data are plotted.Full size imageDeep characterization of neutralizing profiles also predicts the developmental pathway for each bnAb. The convergent multi-donor bnAbs in VH1-18 QXXV class (i.e., 315-09-1B12 and CT149) neutralize many group 2 viruses while having very limited breadth against group 1 viruses (Fig. 5). This confirms previous findings in which the unmutated common ancestor (UCA) of this class of bnAbs engages only group 2 HAs and acquires group 1 reactivity through somatic hypermutation57. Conversely, the VH6-1 + DH3-3 class bnAbs (i.e., MEDI8852, 315-53-1F12, and 315-53-1B06) possess higher neutralization potency against group 1 viruses than group 2 viruses (Fig. 5), and this is consistent with the preferential engagement of group 1 HAs to the UCAs of this class57. This deep neutralization profiling dataset also allows us to generate neutralization breadth–potency curves at relatively high resolution (Fig. 6). Previous studies used a dataset generated by pseudotyped lentiviral neutralization assays with 15–17 selected HA–NA sequences45,57 and provided a limited understanding of neutralization breadth both because of the relatively small number of strains and the hypersensitivity of the pseudotyped lentivirus assay format. By determining the neutralization profiles using our comprehensive R3 virus panel, we found two antibodies (MEDI8852 and FI6v3) that were capable of neutralizing all 55 viruses (Fig. 6). The other two VH6-1 + DH3-3 class mAbs, 315-53-1F12 and 315-53-1B06, neutralized 52 (94.5%) and 54 (98.2%) of 55 viruses, respectively. Although CR9114 neutralized 48 out of 55 viruses (87.3%) its breadth–potency plot demonstrated a biphasic curve, highlighting the preferential neutralization of group 1 viruses (the first phase) and lower potency against group 2 viruses (the second phase) by this antibody (Fig. 6). The RBS-directed antibody C05 showed limited neutralization breadth (32.7%) yet was extremely potent (Fig. 6).Fig. 6: Neutralization breadth-potency analysis of broadly cross-reactive stem-directed antibodies and highly potent receptor-binding site antibody.Neutralization titers (IC80 µg ml−1) against a panel of 55 R3 viruses were used to generate the breadth-potency plot for each antibody. Geometric mean IC80 concentration (GMC) of each antibody was calculated only for the viruses neutralized by given antibody and indicated as a vertical dashed line on each graph. Shaded areas correspond to the number of viruses neutralized by given antibody. Both the number of viruses neutralized out of 55 R3 viruses and neutralization coverage (%) are indicated on each graph.Full size imageOverall, the neutralization profiling performed with the reporter influenza virus assay provides less biased breadth and potency information than the pseudotyped lentivirus assay or highly variable traditional MN assay. High-resolution information may also help predict the class and the origin of antibodies with particular neutralization signatures.DiscussionCurrent influenza vaccines are imperfect and there is a large room to improve their efficacy, consistency, and breadth. Historically, efficacy has been associated with serum HAI activity58,59 and the HAI assay was developed as a surrogate for virus neutralization60,61. To improve current vaccines and to develop new vaccine concepts that will have broader and more durable efficacy, accurate measurement of neutralizing activity across a broad range of influenza viruses is critical. The HAI assay is a surrogate only for neutralization directed at the RBS on HA, therefore neutralization targeting the HA stem or other relatively conserved sites on HA and NA will not correlate with HAI. In addition, some new drifted seasonal strains of influenza and subtypes with pandemic potential do not always have predictable hemagglutination properties. Therefore, to encompass the variety of HA and NA strains and the antibodies induced by diverse vaccine approaches, emphasis on a reproducible and authentic measurement of virus-neutralizing activity is needed.Unlike the HAI assay that measures the antibody’s ability to block receptor binding of viral HA, plaque reduction62 and MN63 assays can capture neutralizing antibodies that block any virus replication step, including attachment, internalization, pH-induced conformational change of HA, membrane fusion, and virus egress. Despite efforts initiated by WHO, execution of influenza neutralization assays is still not standardized, leading to significant variability among results reported by different laboratories9,63. Development of a large panel of representative influenza viruses and significant improvement of assay throughput and safety are highly anticipated in the field and will enable deep characterization and systematic comparisons of influenza virus-neutralizing antibody responses. The virus panel combined with serum and mAb standards will allow normalization across assay platforms and facilitate the evaluation of universal influenza vaccine candidates. In the present study, we address these outstanding needs by building an engineered influenza reporter virus-based neutralization assay coupled with high-throughput image-based readout in a biosafety level 2 setting. Our panel consists of 55 reporter viruses capturing almost the entire antigenic evolution of human H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes as well as historical human H2N2 and three other subtypes circulating at the human–animal interface. Moreover, we were able to rescue and propagate R3 chimeric influenza viruses encoding the HA and NA of influenza B using the internal genes of A/WSN/1933 influenza A virus. R3∆PB1 chimeric influenza A/B viruses can replicate only in cells expressing influenza A PB1 in trans. This approach to rescue viruses expressing HA and NA of influenza B viruses was described in several previous reports64,65,66, and it was shown that chimeric influenza A/B viruses have similar growth profiles as wild-type influenza B viruses66. Although none of the 24 antibodies included in our study neutralized these R3∆PB1 chimeric influenza A/B viruses, we have successfully utilized these viruses in neutralization assays to assess anti-influenza B virus-neutralizing antibody responses elicited by experimental vaccines67.Direct detection of fluorescent reporter allowed us to measure virus replication in live cells without additional signal amplifications unlike ELISA- or hemagglutination-based readout. Image-based readout was chosen to further facilitate fast and precise data acquisition and analysis. In contrast to ELISA-based assays, in which the signal is measured for the entire well after a series of signal amplification steps, image-based detection provides higher signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range, and precision at single-cell resolution. The R3 virus neutralization assays can be readily automated to minimize hands-on time and human errors. It is also worth noting that the fluorescent image-based readout makes the assay more cost-effective compared with other assays such as ELISA- and luciferase-based assays. By using R3 viruses, we can detect virus-inhibitory activity of both anti-HA and anti-NA antibodies by counting number of fluorescent cells or measuring size of fluorescent plaques in a safe and high-throughput manner.Recent attempted improvements of the WHO-recommended ELISA-based MN assay protocol68,69,70 underscore the need for the development of more reliable assays. As noted, previous reports have described the potential utility of R3∆PB118 and R3∆HA19,20 influenza viruses in neutralization assays. However, these efforts did not lead to widespread adoption and the development of standardized influenza neutralization assays due to the small number of available reporter viruses, impediments to access essential reagents (e.g., influenza reverse genetics plasmids and stable cell lines), and lack of comprehensive validation. We found that the antigenicity and neutralization sensitivity of R3∆PB1 is similar to that of authentic influenza viruses, while R3∆HA viruses appeared to be slightly more sensitive to neutralization than R3∆PB1. This is likely due to less efficient HA incorporation into R3∆HA viruses19,20 and represents a common feature of R3∆HA viruses. Although we noticed that the neutralization sensitivity of R4∆PB1 closely matched that of R3∆PB1 implying their potential superiority for building viruses that are unlikely to reassort, additional optimization of R4∆PB1 virus is necessary to become a practical alternative due to its poor rescue efficiency. Although the use of R3 (and R4) viruses offers further advancements in the assay throughput, safety, and precision, this approach has its own limitations. Since the reporter segment is not required for viral replication, it is inevitable that after extensive virus passage, the reporter segment may accumulate mutations made by the error-prone viral RNA polymerase, which in turn, will diminish reporter gene activity and/or expression. However, it is possible to prepare virus stocks relatively quickly with five or less passages, and we confirm that these stocks retain an active reporter gene expression. Additionally, genomic stability of R3 influenza viruses can be improved by utilizing the variant PB1 polymerase with lower error rates as reported recently71 and designing R3 viruses capable of replicating only when the engineered genomic segment is functional, such as inducible gene-expression systems.As we continue to expand our collection of viruses and neutralizing antibodies, we will be able to perform neutralization fingerprint analysis72 to provide a better understanding of the relationships between fine epitope specificity and neutralization breadth and potency and allow computational predictions of the epitope-specific contributions of polyclonal serum antibodies to overall neutralizing activity. This type of analysis will foster the immune monitoring of antibody responses elicited by universal influenza vaccine candidates, particularly those targeting the conserved HA stem supersite73,74,75. By describing our methods and depositing sequences required to generate R3 viruses, we provide the basis for implementing this technology for the strains reported here as well as for future emerging viruses. We anticipate that our assay will foster rapid discovery and characterization of influenza bnAbs as well as virus-inhibitory antibodies and facilitate efficient evaluation of vaccine-elicited antibody responses for accelerating the efforts to develop universal influenza vaccines.MethodsPlasmidsTo prepare influenza reverse genetics plasmids for rescue of influenza A H1N1 or H3N2 viruses described in this study, HA and NA coding sequences were retrieved from Genbank; NCRs of A/WSN/1933 for H1N1 or A/Netherlands/009/2010 for H3N2 viruses were added at both ends. Full-length HA and NA sequences were cloned into a dual promoter influenza reverse genetics plasmid previously described76. To rescue influenza viruses, dual promoter plasmids encoding internal genes of A/WSN/1933 (pHW181-PB2, pHW182-PB1, pHW183-PA, pHW185-NP, pHW187-M, pHW188-NS) were used76. To prepare PB1 reporter segment used to rescue R3 viruses, the sequence containing the PB1 genome packaging signals of A/WSN/193322 and mKate2 or tdKatushka2 reporter coding region23 (Addgene Cat No. 56049) was synthesized and cloned using BsmBI (New England Biolabs) restriction sites into the dual promoter influenza reverse genetics plasmid. Similarly, HA reporter segment was synthesized with HA genome packaging signals of A/Puerto Rico/193419 flanking the tdKatushka2 reporter sequence and cloned into the dual promoter influenza reverse genetics plasmid using BsmBI restriction sites. To prepare the influenza reverse genetics plasmid using chicken beta-actin CAG pol-II promoter (Addgene Cat No. 41583), an insert comprising human pol-I promoter and mouse pol-I terminator sequences in negative orientation flanking two BsmBI restriction sites was cloned using KpnI and XhoI restriction sites. Then full-length of influenza genes of high-yield A/Puerto Rico/8/193477 were cloned into BsmBI restriction sites. To prepare plasmids for stable cell line development, sequences of Streptomyces puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (PAC), which confers resistance to puromycin, followed by self-cleaving peptide of Thosea asigna virus 2A (T2A) and coding region of influenza A PB1, which has PB1-F2 transcript unmodified, or HA genes were synthesized and cloned into pCAGGS plasmid (Addgene Cat No. 41583) using KpnI and XhoI restriction sites. All plasmids were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.CellsTo propagate influenza viruses, MDCK-SIAT1 cells (Millipore Sigma) were used. Cells were maintained with complete media comprising Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium high glucose (DMEM; ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products), 100 units ml−1 penicillin (ThermoFisher), 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin (ThermoFisher), and geneticin (1 mg ml−1) (ThermoFisher). To develop constitutively PB1- or HA-expressing MDCK-SIAT1 cells, one plasmid encoding both puromycin resistance and influenza genes was transfected into MDCK-SIAT1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher). Two days post transfection, cells were transferred from 6-well plates into 10-cm dishes containing DMEM media with 10% bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products), penicillin, streptomycin, geneticin, and puromycin (0.25 μg ml−1; ThermoFisher) for selection. Medium was changed every 48 h. Clonal selection was performed using 8 or 10 mm cloning cylinders (Fisher Scientific) about 2 weeks after the transfection. Clonal cell lines were screened using a reporter virus prepared on a polyclonal cell line. To rescue influenza viruses, Flp-In 293 cells (ThermoFisher) were transfected as described below.Reverse genetics of influenza virusesFor molecular clone influenza viruses, an eight-plasmid approach in which each influenza segment is inserted between pol-II (positive orientation) and pol-I (negative orientation) promoters was used to rescue parental molecular clone viruses. Briefly, Flp-In 293 cells were transfected with dual promoter plasmids encoding each influenza segment of A/WSN/1933 (obtained from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital) and a CMV-driven plasmid expressing human transmembrane serine protease 2 (hTMPRSS2). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 in 6-well plates coated with D-lysine. Three days post infection, TPCK-treated trypsin (0.5 μg ml−1, Sigma) was added to the transfected cells for 2–4 h. Supernatant was harvested, cleared by centrifugation (200 × g, 10 min), and used for propagation in MDCK-SIAT1 cells by limiting dilution. For virus propagation, the inoculum was prepared in virus growth medium comprising of OptiMEM (ThermoFisher) supplemented with TPCK-treated trypsin at 1 μg ml−1. MDCK-SIAT1 flasks containing cells at ~80% confluence were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with the inoculum at 37 °C for virus adsorption. After 1 h, the inoculum was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and virus growth media was added to the cells. The infected cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 2 days, supernatant was harvested when cytopathic effect reached 40–60%, cleared by centrifugation (200 × g, 10 min), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. For influenza HA and NA sequencing, viral RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Influenza viral RNA was amplified using the Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) and HA- and NA-specific primers tagged with M13 sequences. Each amplicon was sequenced with M13 primers in both directions. Primer sequences are available upon request. Sequences were analyzed using Sequencer 5.4 (Gene Codes).For R3∆PB1 influenza viruses, Flp-In 293 cells were transfected with eight dual promoter influenza reverse genetics plasmids (the PB1 reporter segment plasmid replaced the plasmid encoding PB1 of A/WSN/1933) together with pol-II-driven expression plasmid encoding PB1 of A/WSN/1933 and hTMPRSS2. Rescued viruses were propagated in MDCK-SIAT1 cells constitutively expressing PB1 of A/WSN/1933 in the presence of TPCK-treated trypsin (1 μg ml−1). Virus stocks were stored at −80 °C.For replication-restricted rewired ∆PB1 influenza viruses, Flp-In 293 (ThermoFisher) cells were transfected with eight dual promoter influenza reverse genetics plasmids (PB1 segment comprises PB1 genome packaging signals flanking the coding region of an HA segment in which the HA genome packaging signals have been destroyed by introducing silent mutations, while the HA segment of R4∆PB1 contains the reporter gene flanked by intact HA genomic packaging signals) together with pol-II-driven expression plasmid encoding PB1 of A/WSN/1933 and hTMPRSS2. Rescued viruses were propagated as described above.For R3∆HA influenza genes, Flp-In 293 cells were transfected with eight influenza reverse genetics plasmids encoding sequences of high-yield A/Puerto Rico/8/1936 (HA segment was replaced with HA reporter segment described above), pol-II-driven HA and hTMPRSS2 expressing plasmids. Viruses were propagated in MDCK-SIAT1 cells constitutively expressing influenza HA gene in the presence of TPCK-treated trypsin (1 μg ml−1). Virus stocks were stored at –80 °CPhylogenetic and evolution-based conservation analyses of influenza HANucleotide sequences of mature H1 HA (N = 25) and H3 HA (N = 26) proteins were aligned using Muscle algorithm found in Bioedit v7.2.5. Phylogenetic trees were generated using neighbor-joined methods and Kimura 2-parameter substitution model as implemented in MEGA v10. Evolution-based conservation analyses of amino acid residues in the extracellular region of H1 and H3 HA proteins was done using Consurf (http://consurf.tau.ac.il) and visualized on the atomic structures of HA proteins of A/California/07/2009 (PDB ID: 3LZG) and A/Victoria/361/2011 (PDB ID: 4WE8). To evaluate the conservation of each amino acid of H3 HA proteins isolated from influenza viruses circulating in humans, full-length H3 HA sequences of human H3N2 viruses were obtained from the GISAID database (http://platform.gisaid.org). Alignment of nucleotide sequences was performed using MAFFT v7 server-based algorithm using default settings (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/large.html). After removal of redundant sequences and sequences with gaps or degenerate nucleotide bases, we obtained a dataset of 16,893 unique sequences. Due to the large size of this sequence dataset, we clustered sequences (CD-HIT EST at http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit-web-server/cgi-bin/index.cgi?cmd=cd-hit-est) with identity >99.6% and choose a representative sequence from each cluster. The final dataset used to estimate evolution-based conservation of amino acid residues in human H3 HA proteins had 3408 sequences. Similarly, an alignment of 1222 H1 HA of H1N1 viruses circulating in humans between 1918 and 2019 sequences was used to evaluate the conservation of each amino acid of this protein.Virus titration and neutralizationFor molecular clones, ELISA-based influenza MN assay was performed following WHO-recommended protocol. Briefly, influenza viruses were titrated in MDCK-SIAT1 cells plated in 96-well plates at 50,000 cells ml−1 24 h before infection. Virus dilutions were prepared using OptiMEM supplemented with TPCK-treated trypsin (1 µg ml−1). Infected cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 18 h, cells were fixed with 80% cold acetone and air dried. Virus replication was detected by biotin-conjugated antibodies to influenza virus nucleoprotein (MAB8257B and MAB8258B, Millipore Sigma) and was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and SureBlue TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (KPL). Absorbance was read at 450 nm (A450) and 650 nm (A650) with the SpectraMax Paradigm microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The A650 was used to subtract plate background. Half-maximal tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) titer was calculated using Reed–Muench method. Neutralization assays were performed using 100–200 TCID50 units of virus and 4-fold antibody dilutions made in OptiMEM supplemented with TPCK-treated trypsin. Virus and antibody were mixed in equal volumes and incubated 1 h at 37 °C prior to adding to substrate MDCK-SIAT1 cells. Control wells of virus alone (VC) and diluent alone (CC) were included on each plate. Fifty microliters of antibody–virus mixture were then added to wells of pre-washed cells in duplicate and the plates were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Infected cells were detected as described above. The percent neutralization was calculated by constraining the VC control as 0% and the CC control as 100% and plotted against antibody concentration. A curve fit was generated by a four-parameter nonlinear fit model in Prism (GraphPad). The 80% (IC80) inhibitory concentrations were obtained from the curve fit for each antibody.Titer of R3∆PB1 or R3∆HA viruses was measured in PB1-expressing MDCK-SIAT1 cells plated in 96-well black plates with transparent bottom (Greiner) at 18 h post infection and counting fluorescent foci using Celigo Image Cytometer (Nexcelom) with customized red channel to enhance detection of mKate2dKatushka2 reporter (EX 540/80 nm, DIC 593 nm and EM 593/LP nm). In Celigo operation and analysis software v4.1, Target 1 protocol was used to detect and count fluorescent foci. Titer was expressed as fluorescent foci per ml. For each neutralization reaction, virus dilution that resulted in cca. 1000 (500–4000) fluorescent foci per well at 18 h post infection was used. Neutralization assays using R3 viruses performed to compare the fluorescence- and ELISA-based assays were done in 96-well black transparent bottom plates. Cells were plated 24 h before the experiment. Neutralization reaction was done as described above. R3 influenza neutralization assay was optimized to be performed in 384-well plate format. PB1-expressing MDCK-SIAT1 cells were washed twice with PBS, re-suspended in OptiMEM, and plated 2 h before the assay in 384-well plates at 150,000 cells ml−1 (20 µl per well). Twenty-five microliters of each neutralization mixture consisted of 2 μg ml−1 TPCK-treated trypsin and equal parts of virus and 4-fold serial dilutions of antibodies were transferred to wells in quadruplicate. Control wells of virus alone (VC) and diluent alone (CC) were included on each plate. Fluorescent foci were counted at 18–24 h post infection using a Celigo instrument. Neutralization titers were calculated using Prism as described above.Detailed protocols are provided as Supplementary Notes 1 and 2.Antibody preparationSequences of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains were synthesized and cloned into human IgG1 as previously described49. The expression vectors were transiently transfected into Expi293F (ThermoFisher) using ExpiFectamine 293 transfection reagents (ThermoFisher). mAbs were purified using sepharose Protein-A (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer’s instructions.Negative stain EMVirus preparations were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with fixative containing 4% glutaraldehyde and 0.2 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7. A drop of the fixed sample was placed on a carbon-coated, glow-discharged copper grid for about 30 s. The drop was then removed using filter paper, and the grid was washed with three drops of buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7, and 150 mM NaCl, followed by negative staining with 0.75% uranyl formate. Imaging was performed using a ThermoFisher Talos F200C electron microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with a Ceta camera.Statistics and reproducibilityAll statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism software. Specific tests used to determine statistical significance are indicated in the “Methods” section and corresponding figure legends. Probability values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Here we apply electron cryotomography and subtomogram averaging to describe the structural basis for hexagonal lattice formation by HEF on the viral surface. The conformation of the glycoprotein in situ is distinct from the structure of the isolated trimeric ectodomain, showing that a splaying of the membrane distal domains is required to mediate contacts that form the lattice. The splaying of these domains is also coupled to changes in the structure of the stem region which is involved in membrane fusion, thereby linking HEF’s membrane fusion conformation with its assembly on the virus surface. The glycoprotein lattice can form independent of other virion components but we show a major role for the matrix layer in particle formation.

Infection typically causes a mild upper-respiratory tract illness that can progress to severe disease of the lower respiratory tract, particularly in young children1,2,3. The lipid-enveloped influenza C virus infects cells by binding receptors on the cell surface and enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Following fusion of the viral membrane with the endosome membrane, the viral genome can enter the cytoplasm. During assembly, it acquires an envelope and surface proteins by budding through host cell membranes. Influenza C contains seven negative−sense genomic segments encoding seven structural proteins and two non-structural proteins. It encodes a single envelope glycoprotein, the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion factor (HEF) which is a multifunctional protein that mediates receptor binding, receptor destruction, and membrane fusion4,5,6,7. In contrast, influenza A and B have eight genomic segments and encode two surface glycoproteins with receptor binding and membrane fusion mediated by the haemagglutinin (HA) and receptor destruction by the neuraminidase (NA). HEF is therefore unique amongst the ortho- and paramyxovirus glycoproteins in mediating all three functions. Another unique feature is that the single HEF protein forms a hexagonal lattice on the surface of the virion which may play a role in assembly8,9. Lattices persist as glycoprotein networks when proteolytically released from virus8,10 suggesting that they are mediated by glycoprotein interactions and glycoprotein contacts are observed in low-resolution negative stain reconstructions9. Lattices are observed on both spherical and filamentous particles, but the filamentous morphology is a property associated with the M1 protein which forms a layer beneath the membrane11,12.Proteolytic cleavage of the HEF0 precursor, producing disulfide-linked subunits HEF1 and HEF2, is required for membrane fusion activity that is activated when the virus encounters low pH during host cell entry through the endosomal pathway4. HEF2 is anchored in the viral membrane by a C-terminal transmembrane region and contains an N-terminal hydrophobic fusion peptide. The X-ray crystal structure of the bromelain-released trimeric ectodomain of HEF showed that each HEF monomer consists of three functional domains13. HEF1 forms a receptor-binding domain (R) that recognizes receptors containing 9-O-acetyl sialic acid and an esterase domain (E) that functions as a receptor-destroying 9-O-acetylesterase. In addition, N-terminal and C-terminal segments of HEF1 combine with HEF2 to form the membrane fusion domain (F) (Supplementary Fig. 1).Knowledge of the structural organization of the influenza C virus envelope is required to understand how HEF performs its multiple functions in the context of the virus and how HEF plays a role in virus self-assembly. Here we apply electron cryo-tomography to study the influenza C virus envelope and subtomogram averaging to the HEF glycoprotein, revealing the in situ conformation of the protein in the virus surface lattice. The conformation has implications for structural re-arrangements of the HEF protein that mediate membrane fusion. In addition, the matrix layer formed by the M1 protein and associated with the inside of the virus envelope plays a role in determining particle morphology and genome packaging.ResultsElectron cryotomography of influenza C virusWe purified viral particles and recorded cryo-EM images and electron cryo-tomograms of vitrified virions (Fig. 1a–e, Supplementary Fig. 2). The particles are pleomorphic and contain both spherical and filamentous particles of varying size covered by extended areas of the HEF glycoprotein organized in open hexagonal lattices, as previously described9. Analysis of tomograms in 3D reveals that spherical particles can be further classified by the presence (Fig. 1a, b) or absence (Fig. 1c) of a dense matrix layer in the virus interior adjacent to the inner membrane leaflet. Spherical particles with a matrix layer also contain a dense packing of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) that package the genome in their interior. By contrast, spherical particles without a matrix layer have relatively empty interiors that lack RNPs but may contain small vesicles or cytoskeletal material. These empty particles suggest that the HEF glycoprotein layer on the membrane is sufficient for the budding of virus-like particles, in agreement with observations by electron microscopy of plastic sections of the plasma membrane of infected cells showing clustered surface projections and particles without RNP assemblies10.Fig. 1: Electron cryotomography of influenza C virus.a A central section through spherical virions with a matrix layer. Visible are the outer glycoprotein layer on the virus surface, the electron-dense matrix layer that appears continuous with the inner membrane leaflet, and ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) in the interior. b The same virions as in panel a in a tomogram section showing the hexagonal organization of the glycoprotein layer on the virus surface. c A central section through particles lacking a matrix layer. The glycoprotein layer is visible but the matrix layer is absent beneath the bilayer and the interior is less electron-dense and lacks compact RNPs. These particles also exemplify the size variation in the particles without a matrix layer (See also Supplementary Fig. 2). d, e A filamentous particle is shown in a central section (d) or a section through the surface (e) showing the hexagonal organization of the glycoprotein layer. Each image in a-e shows a sum of 20 tomogram slices corresponding to a projected volume ~9 nm thick and are at the same scale. Tomograms were recorded (as described in Supplementary Table 1) from a single preparation of the virus. f Helical reconstruction from 2D images of a single filamentous virion at 32 Å resolution. The ~76 nm thick filament shows the hexagonal lattice covering the surface.Full size imageDespite their similarity, we found a different size distribution for spherical particles with or without a matrix. We measured the maximum and minimum (in-plane) diameter of spherical-type viral particles from 31 tomograms (n = 220, Supplementary Fig. 3) and found particles with a matrix layer are more homogeneous, having a slightly smaller mean diameter and a much smaller variance (88.2 nm (STD 5.4) compared to 97.7 nm (STD 30.6)). The matrix layer is thus associated with and may impart a more defined size and curvature of the virus particles. Alternatively, because the matrix layer may be the point of attachment of the RNP assembly, the size of the packaged RNP assembly may also determine virion size and morphology.Filamentous particles of varying diameter sometimes packaged RNPs at one end, but always contained a cylindrical matrix layer, usually surrounding a largely empty interior, suggesting a structural role for the matrix layer. The hexagonal glycoprotein lattice displayed in some cases a helical organization, but with varying symmetry between different particles. We obtained a low-resolution map (~32 Å) from several images of a single filament recorded at different defocus values showing the open hexagonal lattice (Fig. 1f) formed by HEF trimers.In situ structure of HEF by subtomogram averagingTo obtain more detailed structural information of the glycoproteins without dependence on long-range order in filaments, we applied subtomogram averaging to glycoproteins on spherical virus particles. We picked and averaged subtomograms of the envelope from spherical virus particles with a matrix, revealing the 150 Å long trimeric HEF (Fig. 2a) at 9.2 Å resolution (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 1). The map shows clear density for the central and outer alpha-helices in the membrane-proximal HEF2 stem region, but the membrane distal HEF1, which is mostly beta-sheet, has fewer resolved secondary structural features. Local resolution estimation indicates that the HEF2 stem region is generally better resolved, suggesting some flexibility in the HEF1 membrane distal region (Supplementary Fig. 5). Also visible in the map is the density for neighboring HEF’s at contact points on the HEF1 head region.Fig. 2: In situ structure of a HEF trimer based on subtomogram averaging.a Side (left) and a top view (right) of a map (9.2 Å resolution, Supplementary Fig. 4) obtained by averaging subvolumes containing HEF from the membrane of influenza C virions possessing a matrix layer.

The interhelical loop between the HEF2 central helix and outer helices is shown, as well as the β-sheet it forms with HEF1. e A top view down the trimeric axis of the HEF map as described for panel b. The two arrows indicate the direction of displacement of the top of the central helix and the interhelical loop of HEF2 when comparing the crystal structure to the fitted model. See also Supplementary Movie 1.Full size imageA comparison between the newly obtained map and the crystal structure of the trimeric ectodomain of HEF reveals a dramatic difference in the overall conformation of the molecule (Fig. 2b). The map and the X-ray model show good agreement in much of the stem region but the maps diverge in the head region where HEF1 domains are splayed out. We applied flexible fitting of the X-ray model to obtain a model for the in situ structure of HEF (Fig. 2b, c). Comparison14 of the in situ model with the X-ray model shows points of flexion in both HEF1 (residues 33–34 and 408–409) and HEF2 (residues 65–69 and 99–100). A model with a similar agreement to the map may be obtained by fitting each X-ray model monomer as 4 rigid bodies identified by the points of flexion. The resulting models have better agreement with the map as measured by cross-correlation and map-model Fourier Shell Correlation (cc score of 0.93, map-to-model FSC of 10.9 Å at 0.5, Supplementary Fig. 6). The HEF1 head region in isolation (residues 41 to 371 of HEF1) behaves as a rigid body and itself does not undergo any significant conformational changes in our fitted model compared to the X-ray structure (1.0 Å2 RMSD). The HEF1 head region rotates 20° clockwise (viewed toward the HEF2 stem) and its center of mass is displaced ~7 Å further away from the three-fold axis toward the peripheral density of the nearest neighboring trimer (Supplementary Video 1).The large movement of the HEF1 head region is accompanied by changes in the organization of the long trimeric α-helices that form the central architecture of HEF2 (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. 7). Similar to influenza A HA, HEF2 has long central alpha-helices along the three-fold axis and smaller N-terminal alpha helices connected by an interhelical loop and preceded by the N-terminal fusion peptide (Supplementary Fig. 1). However, the central helices of HEF2 in the X-ray structure interact closely in the middle but diverge from the trimer axis at the top (interhelix distance ~24 Å) where the interhelical loops interpose between them (Fig. 2c, e). Each interhelical loop of HEF2 also participates as an antiparallel strand in a four-stranded β-sheet that includes part of the esterase domain (HEF1 residues 378–398) (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 1). In the outward position of HEF1 observed in the in situ structure, the HEF2 interhelical loop remains associated with the HEF1 beta-sheet and no longer interposes between long helices (Fig. 2d, e) allowing the tops of the central helices to associate along the trimer axis (interhelix distance ~12 Å) (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Movie 1). The central helices in the in situ structure thus make interactions that are required to form an extended coiled-coil intermediate at low pH as observed for influenza A HA15,16.In the in situ structure, we identify prominent elongated densities on the surface for carbohydrates at N-linked glycosylation sites N12 and N381 of HEF1 and N106 of HEF2 (Supplementary Fig. 8) that further validate the fitted model. In addition, we can tentatively assign density to N157 of HEF2. Approximately nineteen amino acids (residues 166–184) beyond the C-terminus of our fitted model make the connection to the transmembrane region. In this membrane-proximal region, we observe a bifurcation of the map density (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 8) and therefore require a higher resolution map in this region to interpret how the attachment to the membrane is made. Though the bottom part of HEF2 is similar in both the X-ray and in situ structures (Supplementary Fig. 7) and differences in the membrane distal parts reflect a clear hinge point 75 Å from the membrane, we cannot exclude that differences in the ectodomain structures result from the attachment of the transmembrane anchor in the viral envelope. For influenza A HA, the ectodomain is connected to the membrane by flexible linkers and the structure of the ectodomain is unchanged by the transmembrane anchor17.HEF forms a hexagonal lattice via HEF1–HEF1 contactsIn the map of the HEF trimer in the hexagonal lattice, density for neighboring trimers was also evident. To further investigate the contacts involved in forming the hexagonal lattice, we applied subtomogram averaging on interfacing dimers of HEF trimers and obtained a 10.7 Å map (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 4) showing two well-resolved HEF trimers and contact points between HEF1 domains at their periphery. The in situ model obtained for the single HEF trimer fits well into the density of the two contacting HEF trimers when placed as rigid bodies (cc score of 0.92, map-to-model FSC of 13.6 Å at 0.5, Fig. 3b).Fig. 3: The HEF1-HEF1 dimer interface is the basis for lattice contacts between HEF trimers.a Side (left) and a top view (right) of a map (10.2 Å resolution, Supplementary Fig. 4) obtained by subtomogram averaging of two interfacing HEF trimers.

Three polypeptide segments that are proximal in the dimer interface and may form homotypic contacts (HEF1 R domain loop 161–168) and heterotypic contacts (HEF1 R domain loop 208–214 and HEF1 E domain 101–106) are shown in gold. Potential homotypic contacts (containing atoms within 6 Å) between HEF1 R domain loops 161–168 include Leu164 (100% conserved) and Thr167 (99.7% conserved). Heterotypic contacts (containing atoms within 6 Å) occur between HEF1 R domain loop residues Gly211 and Thr212 (both 100% conserved) and HEF1 E residues Tyr101 (100%), Leu102 (100%), and Gln104 (100%), as well as Arg81 (99.4%), part of an additional highly conserved esterase segment. Conservation is based on NCBI non-redundant sequences for influenza C HEF. Panel d shows the view of the interface on one monomer after segmentation. Ligands (yellow) identify the receptor binding and enzyme active sites in b–d.Full size imageThe in situ “open” conformation of HEF appears to be stabilized by HEF1-HEF1 interactions and the splaying of the membrane distal regions is required to mediate the contacts. We identify polypeptide segments in HEF that are proximal at the interface (Fig. 3c, d). While the esterase domain is at the most peripheral position in the X-ray ectodomain structure, the conformation observed here additionally brings the receptor-binding domains into proximity. The model for HEF interactions shows that the receptor binding sites and the esterase active sites are exposed within the lattice, with the receptor-binding site being closer to the apex. Antigenic epitopes identified by antibody escape mutants are predicted to be mostly exposed in the lattice, but antigenic sites A-3 (HEF1 residue 164) and A-4 (HEF1 residue 212) are located at interfaces between trimers in the lattice where binding may potentially disrupt lattice contacts18,19. The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) occurs as a dimer on the surface of some beta coronaviruses and is structurally homologous to the R and E domains of HEF (25% sequence identity)20. We note that the HEF1-HEF1 interface between trimers in influenza C is different from the dimeric interface observed for the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE)20.We also applied subtomogram averaging to spherical virions lacking a matrix layer and reconstructed maps of a single trimer and a dimer of trimers (Supplementary Fig. 9) to 10.0 Å and 11.3 Å resolution, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4). The maps show that HEF adopts the same open conformation as we observed on spherical virions with a matrix layer and the in situ models of HEF fit well into the trimer map (CC score of 0.91, map-to-model FSC is 12.1 Å at 0.5). The model of a dimer of trimers also fits the map well (CC score of 0.95, map-to-model FSC is 12.9 Å at 0.5) with minor differences in density at the trimer interface. The HEF glycoproteins thus form the same lattice structure independent of the matrix layer and in absence of other virion components.Plasticity of the HEF latticeSubtomogram averaging of a filamentous particle was used to reconstruct a region of the HEF lattice (26 Å, Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 4) showing that HEF adopts the same in situ conformation. We fit several HEF trimer models into the density on the cylindrical surface (Fig. 4b). As shown in sections through the map, the curvature on the membrane is greater on the filament than on the spherical particles and also depends on direction (Fig. 4c). The HEF trimers make dimer interactions with a relative angle between trimer axes of 11.9 and 15.9 degrees. While the cylindrical shape of the filament may largely be determined by the matrix layer, HEF can form lateral contacts at different membrane curvatures. In spherical particles with and without a matrix, the relative trimer angle between trimer axes is 9.5 and 7.1 degrees, respectively, the latter due to the slightly lower radius of curvature of the particles. The observed flexibility at the hinge regions of HEF1 may be a mechanism to adjust the dimeric contacts to different curvatures, though higher resolution analysis is required to understand the different contacts.Fig. 4: Plasticity of the HEF surface lattice.a Two views of a map obtained by subtomogram averaging of a region of a filamentous virion (26 Å resolution, Supplementary Fig. 4). Scalebar 50 Å. b Trimer models fit into the map in a. c Cross-sections through maps obtained by subtomogram averaging showing HEF interface on the membrane with different curvatures. Panels i and ii show sections through the filament map in panel a at lines ci and cii, respectively. Panels iii and iv show dimers of trimers calculated for virions with (iii) and without (iv) a matrix layer visible beneath the bilayer. Angles between HEF 3-fold axes are indicated.Full size imageDiscussionOur structural analysis of HEF by subtomogram averaging reveals the in situ conformation of the glycoprotein on the virus surface. The dramatic splaying of the membrane distal HEF1 creates HEF1-HEF1 dimeric contacts between trimers that are the structural basis for the hexagonal surface lattice. The same HEF conformation and lattice are observed on particles where HEF is present without the matrix layer and internal assembly of RNPs. We conclude that hexagonal lattice formation on the membrane is mediated by glycoprotein interactions and is not dependent on interactions between other virion components. The HEF lattice is plastic and accommodates a range of curvatures which may be important in driving assembly during the budding of the virus.Secondly, though HEF lattices may form independently of the matrix layer, the matrix layer has an important role in virus particle assembly. The presence of the matrix layer influences the particle curvature and morphology as shown for the different particle types studied here. This is consistent with observations that single amino acid substitutions in M1 influence the formation of a filamentous particle type21 (“cords”) that typically lack RNP assemblies12. It is thus likely that interactions between the matrix and the envelope, as well as the attachment of the RNP assembly to the matrix layer, determine the uniformity of spherical particle sizes and shapes.The conformation of HEF on the virus surface has features important to the mechanism of membrane fusion. The re-positioning of the membrane distal domains of HEF1, which is the basis of the lattice contacts, is coupled to a structural change in HEF2 that brings the top of the long, central helices closer along the trimer axis. The in situ arrangement may facilitate the N-terminal extension of a HEF2 coiled-coil at the pH of membrane fusion. In addition, the splaying of the head domains creates an open cavity along the trimer axis that exposes HEF2 (Fig. 5) and is sufficiently wide to accommodate a HEF2 extended intermediate similar to that described for influenza A HA that moves the fusion peptide toward the target membrane16,22. Indeed, a separation of the membrane distal domains has been noted as a requirement for membrane fusion23 in influenza A HA and is observed by cryo-EM in structural transitions in HA at low pH before the formation of an extended intermediate16. Thus, the open HEF conformation in the surface lattice resembles an early dilated HA fusion intermediate and may similarly facilitate the low-pH transition and interaction with the target membrane. Lattice disassembly, observed following incubation of influenza C virus at low pH5, is likely to be a requirement for subsequent steps in membrane fusion where several HEF molecules bring the membranes together.Fig. 5: In situ structure of HEF has implications for structural rearrangements that mediate membrane fusion.a Closed conformation of ectodomain X-ray structure (pdb id: 1FLC). b In situ structure shows splaying of the membrane distal domains of HEF1 (blue/cyan) with an open cavity on the trimer axis revealing the HEF2 subunit (red). c Influenza A HA (pdbid: 6Y5K) extended intermediate shows that membrane distal HA1 subunits (blue/cyan) are displaced outward with the extended coiled-coil of the HA2 subunit (red) projecting between them. The top row shows a side view, the bottom row shows a view along the trimer axis looking toward the membrane.Full size imageHEF is also present as the single surface glycoprotein on the orthomyxovirus influenza D (55% sequence identity)24 and is reported to form a hexagonal lattice on the virus surface25. The crystal structure of the HEF ectodomain from influenza D shows the same closed HEF conformation observed for influenza C. The closed conformation of HEF may be functionally important and may stabilize the pre-fusion state before HEF is integrated into the lattice. A function of HEF that may be essential before virus assembly is complete is the receptor-destroying esterase activity. The esterase activity is present on the assembled virus7 and may play a role in virus entry but is essential for hydrolyzing receptors on the cell surface and on virus glycoproteins to facilitate virus release from the cell surface during budding26. Mobility of HEF may be important for the esterase active site to reach and hydrolyze receptor molecules before HEF becomes constrained in the surface lattice and primed for the structural re-arrangements associated with membrane fusion. Our structural analysis of HEF on the virions shows the structural basis for lattice formation by HEF and that HEF functions involved in virus entry may be linked to HEF’s conformation in the lattice.MethodsVirus growth, purification, and vitrificationInfluenza C/Johannesburg/1/1966 strain was cultured in MDCK cells. Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMED media supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin in T175 triple-stacked flasks. Cells were washed in PBS and then infected in serum-free DMEM media supplemented with 0.02 M HEPES (pH 7.5), 2.5 μg/ml trypsin, and virus seed. The infection took place at 33 °C for 48 h. The cell supernatant was initially clarified by centrifugation at 650 × g in a benchtop centrifuge followed by ultracentrifugation at ~100,000 × g at 4 °C to pellet the virus. The virus was resuspended in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 10 mM CaCl2 (TBS-Ca). The resuspended virus was either prepared for microscopy by plunge freezing (for 2D imaging of filamentous particles) or further purified by ultracentrifugation through a discontinuous 30–60% sucrose gradient at ~100,000 × g at 4 °C. The 30–60% interface was collected and diluted in TBS-Ca and finally pelleted again by ultracentrifugation at ~100,000 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in TBS-Ca. The virus was prepared for cryo-EM by vitrification using the Vitrobot™ (Mark III) on Quantifoil R 2/4 holey carbon grids with a 100 × 400 mesh that were glow-discharged in the presence of amylamine. The sample was mixed with 10 nm colloidal gold particles as fiducial markers prior to vitrification.Electron microscopy, image processing, and tomogram reconstructionData collection parameters and refinement statistics can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Cryomicrographs for helical reconstruction were collected on a Tecnai Spirit transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI) operated at 120 keV and equipped with an Eagle 4k detector (FEI) at a pixel size of 3.6 Å/pixel. Tilt series for tomographic reconstruction and subtomogram averaging were collected on a Titan Krios TEM (Thermo Fisher) using the Tomography software (Thermo Fisher) for automation. The microscope was fitted with a Gatan GIF Quantum energy filter operating in zero-loss mode with a slit width of 20 eV and a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan) operated in counting mode. Bi-directional tomographic tilt series were collected from 0° to +54° and −3° to −54° (or −42°) at a 3° interval in movie mode at a pixel size of 2.2 Å/pixel. Four frames were collected per tilt with a dose of 1.57 e−/Å2 per tilt, giving a total accumulated dose of 58.1 e−/Å2 (or 51.8 e−/Å2) for each tilt series. Movie frames were motion-corrected and dose weighted using alignframes from the IMOD package27,28. Tilt series were aligned using Etomo from the IMOD package27,28, the contrast transfer function (CTF) was estimated using CTFFIND429 and tomograms were CTF corrected and reconstructed using novaCTF30.Helical reconstructionA single filamentous virion was imaged at three different defoci on a Technai Spirit TEM (see above). Iterative helical reconstruction31 was performed using SPIDER32 where parameters for the helical rise (42.12 Å), turn (−18.53°), and symmetry (C7) were obtained. Further helical processing33 was performed in RELION 3.034 where the filament was boxed, extracted and initial 2D averages were obtained. Further 3D real-space helical classification and refinement finally produced a structure of the hexagonal HEF lattice at ~32 Å resolution. The images were CTF corrected using CTFFIND429.Subtomogram averaging (STA)Tomograms containing viral particles decorated with glycoproteins were selected for STA. Spherical particles were grouped and processed separately based on the presence or absence of a matrix layer. Dynamo35 was used to pick coordinates of HEF on each viral particle surface by generating random seeds at either a 30 or 40 Å interval. 3D particles were extracted with trimvol from the IMOD package27,28. All subsequent steps were performed using RELION 3.034. Initial processing was performed on tomograms that were binned by a factor of 2. Extracted particles were normalized before an initial round of 3D refinement with a cylindrical mask. Here a starting model was used that was generated from the crystal structure of the trimer (PDBID: 1FLC) using pdb2mrc from EMAN236 and low pass filtered to 60 Å. Particles were then subject to a 3D classification using initially C1 or C3 symmetry and subsequently C3 symmetry. The resulting classes were only selected for further refinement when a clear elongated structure was observed, which was in all cases either one or two classes. Overlapping particles were removed and remaining particles were split into two different subsets where subtomograms from the same tomograms were grouped together to avoid aligning systematic noise. These two subsets were then used for a gold-standard 3D refinement and post-processing using a mask generated from a low pass filtered and segmented structure of the HEF from the previous 3D classification using Chimera37. Refined particles were then re-extracted from un-binned tomograms and subject to 3D classification, overlapping particle removal, regrouping, a gold standard refinement, and post-processing using C3 symmetry. The masks that were used for 3D classification, refinement, and post-processing of the un-binned maps were generated from a segmented structure (program Chimera37) of the HEF from a 3D classification that was low pass filtered and extended (at least eight pixels) and further given a soft edge (eight pixels) using the program relion_mask_create. In the cases of dimers of HEF trimers, a starting model was generated by using the calculated map of the single trimer to orient two crystal structure models of the HEF relative to each other by using the location of neighboring trimers which are visible in the single trimer map. These two models were then converted to a density map and low pass filtered to 60 Å. 3D classification, overlapping particle removal, regrouping, a gold standard refinement, and post-processing were performed using C2 symmetry with masks created as described above.An initial 3D map generated de novo in Relion using stochastic gradient decent and subsequently refined showed the same features as refinements starting from the low-pass filtered X-ray model. In addition, a single filamentous virion was processed independently for the structure presented in Fig. 4a using a starting model of four trimers and later a mask containing 6 trimers.Viral particle measurementThe diameter of 220 viral particles from 31 tomograms was measured in IMOD28. Two measurements were taken from each particle, the maximum and minimum diameter in a horizontal plane. 136 particles with a matrix layer and 84 particles without a matrix layer were measured and the data were analyzed and plotted with the Seaborn package in Python. A Welch T-test and Levene’s test were performed with the SciPy package in Python and used to compare the mean and the distribution, respectively, of the particle populations.Flexible fitting of HEF crystal structure into EM densityThe Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting (MDFF) tool38, a part of the VMD 1.9.3 package39, was used to generate a fitted model from the HEF crystal structure13 using the STA map of HEF from virions containing a matrix layer. All calculations were performed with NAMD 2.1340 using the CHARMM36 force field41. Simulations were performed in an explicit solvent with 0.1 mM NaCl, a Langevin piston algorithm was used to maintain constant pressure at 1.01325 bar and at a temperature of 293 K. Periodic boundary conditions and grid spacing of 3 Å were used. Non-bonded interactions were calculated every 2 fs and full electrostatics every 4 fs. Symmetry restraints were applied to the trimeric structure, glycans were restrained as rigid bodies and additionally, secondary structure, hydrogen bonds, cis-peptides, and chiral centers were restrained. A scaling force of 0.3 kcal/mol was applied to the density map. The simulations were run for 5 ns and cross-correlation scores were used to assess the fitting. Glycans were rebuilt post flexible fitting using Coot42 and the final structure was subject to one round of energy minimization with MDFF. DynDom was used to analyze and identify the hinge region in the fitted model. Results similar to the MDFF model were obtained using a rigid body fitted model consisting of two rigid bodies: (1) HEF1 residues 35–407 and HEF2 residues 70–98 (2) HEF1 residues 1–32 and 410–427 and HEF2 residues 6–64 and 101–160. Map-to-model FSC curves were computed using the Phenix package43. The local resolution of the map of the HEF trimer from spherical particles with a matrix layer was calculated using cryoSPARC44.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Facebook Linkedin Threads Whatsapp Reddit Email Page link Regular monitoring of wild aquatic birds and the wild bird-poultry-wetland interface is essential to understanding avian influenza viruses’ prevalence.Proactively enhancing monitoring of wild bird and animal disease in the environment can serve as an early warning system of change/arrival of potential diseases.According to a 2020 study, there was evidence of interaction between poultry and wild waterfowl concerning H5N1 outbreaks in India.See All Key Ideas As avian flu swept through India towards the end of 2020 and early 2021, states scrambled to step up vigil and measures to control the spread of the disease. The 2020/2021 outbreak, marked by the significant involvement and mortality of wild birds, has spotlighted the need for proactive monitoring of animal disease in the environment, conserving unprotected wetland habitats to curb disease spread, and addressing knowledge gaps like the wild waterfowl–poultry interface. Avian Influenza (AI) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects both domestic and wild birds. AI occurs worldwide, and different strains are more prevalent in certain areas of the world than others. According to the World Organisation for Animal Health, wild aquatic birds, such as geese, shorebirds, and wild ducks, are the natural reservoirs of influenza A viruses. AI viruses are broadly classified as low pathogenic AI (LPAI) and highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) viruses, based on their pathogenicity. The latest bird flu outbreak in poultry and wild birds spanned 14 Indian states / Union Territories from Jammu and Kashmir in the north to Kerala in the south. Haryana, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Kerala were particularly severely affected. The latest outbreak involved highly pathogenic viral strains H5N1 and H5N8, according to the Indian government. “Avian influenza and other zoonotic diseases are in the environment, and as human activities encroach natural habitats and environments used by wild species, the risk of transmission increases. We have reached a stage where we must proactively enhance monitoring of wild bird and animal disease in our environment to act as an early warning system of change/arrival of potential diseases,” Taej Mundkur, International Waterbird Census Coordinator and Senior Technical Officer, Wetlands International (The Netherlands), told Mongabay-India. “Such a surveillance programme should be developed through organising year-round passive and active surveillance at a network of locations across the country. This will allow us to be better prepared and respond when a new pathogen or new strain of a known pathogen arrives,” said Mundkur, adding that the One Health framework, in its broadest sense, aims to improve the health of humans, agriculture, and wildlife/environment and recognises this web of interconnections and interactions across our planet earth. Chart from Farah Ishtiaq. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the Convention on Migratory Species and the Scientific Task Force on Avian Influenza and Migratory Birds have provided valuable international guidance on responses/actions to avian influenza in the wild birds-wetland interface, adds Mundkur. They include ensuring that there is no consideration of killing wild birds, spraying toxic products, or negatively affecting wetland habitats as disease control measures, guidance on disease control measures are relevant for both Ramsar sites and all other protected and unprotected wetlands and increasing biosecurity of wetland site. India has emerged as a global hotspot for HPAI H5N1, while also providing critical wintering habitat for many species of migratory waterfowl and year-round habitat for several resident waterfowl species. The country lies at the heart of Central Asian Flyway (CAF), which spans 30 countries and covers 279 populations of 182 migratory waterbird species that rely on wetlands along the flyway, including the Pong Dam wetlands (Pong Lake Wildlife Sanctuary), a Ramsar site, where large scale mortalities of long-distance migratory birds such as bar-headed geese, first alerted biologists in December 2020. Reports of deaths of over 2000 birds at Pong Lake in Himachal Pradesh were followed by alerts of peacock mortalities in Maharashtra, deaths of lapwings near Kharo Dam in Gujarat’s Junagadh district, and jungle crows in Uttarakhand. Upon confirmation of the avian flu outbreak, a total of 4,49,271 poultry birds were culled till February 12, 2021, to control the disease spread, as per the National Action Plan for Prevention, Control, and Containment of Avian Influenza. India’s poultry sector is valued at about Rs. 80,000 crore and employs over 10 lakh farmers. A flock of waterbirds in an urban wetland.

Addressing knowledge gaps Knowledge gaps remain in the nature of the wild waterfowl–poultry interface and the sharing of diverse wetland habitat among these birds. Evolutionary ecologist Farah Ishtiaq underscored the need for a well-designed study to screen poultry and domestic waterfowl for low pathogenic viruses. “We lack such data,” Ishtiaq told Mongabay-India. “High species diversity and low water temperature are known to enhance virus survival in certain parts of the world. However, in the Indian context, poultry plays a huge role in circulating the virus throughout the year. Therefore, there have been reports of outbreaks in nonseason time as well,” added Ishtiaq, senior scientist at Tata Institute for Genetics and Society. She stressed on rapid testing for confirming the cause of death of wild birds. “Viruses are very sensitive to temperature and RNA degrades really fast with an increase in temperature. We need a simplified system to screen such samples in real-time as the cases are reported to ascertain the cause and viral strain,” said Ishtiaq. According to landscape epidemiologist Michael Walsh, co-author of a 2020 study that systematically investigated the extent of the interface between wild waterfowl and poultry and its influence on the risk of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in India, there was evidence of interaction between poultry and wild waterfowl concerning H5N1 outbreaks. The sharing of water resources in wetland habitat is fundamental to understanding the wild waterfowl–poultry interface and the avian influenza virus, subtype H5N1. This virus infects, and is shed by, the intestinal tract of both waterfowl and poultry and thus the water bodies used by these birds can serve as a common vehicle for waterborne transmission in processes of both spillover and spillback. Chart from Walsh, Michael G. et.al, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) Landscape Suitability Varies by Wetland Habitats and the Degree of Interface between Wild Waterfowl and Poultry in India (mdpi, 2020). “Our results showed that outbreak risk did increase with increasing poultry density, which is in line with previous studies. However, what we also showed (and what previous studies have not explored) is that when you consider the landscapes where these poultry are held, outbreak risk was actually highest among low-density poultry holdings where poultry were in prime wild waterfowl habitat. Conversely, outbreak risk was higher among high-density poultry holdings only when those holdings were in areas where the poultry were least likely to come into contact with wild waterfowl,” Walsh, at the University of Sydney, told Mongabay-India. The study also found that H5N1 outbreak occurrence was higher with greater proximity specifically to lakes, rivers, and coastal wetlands. These findings provide specific points in the landscape that may be good targets for interrupting the cycling of avian influenza viruses, for example, by blocking the mixed-use of surface water by domestic poultry and wild waterfowl. While the emphasis should be on monitoring multiple waterbird sites of local, national, and international importance, surveillance is complicated by the nature of the poultry-wildbird-wetlands interface. “The story is not simple; domestic birds in an infected area are interacting with wild birds and some of these birds may be resident or migratory; the environment can be infected so you have these interactions happening in an area where there is an infection,” explained Mundkur. “As poultry themselves don’t fly around, the virus can be carried in the trade of poultry/poultry products, pet birds, and in equipment (fomites) between farms and from the farms to wetlands and to markets. Once the virus is introduced into a wetland, it can infect migratory or domestic birds, and from where the virus can move to another area through local movements of these birds. This may then reinfect poultry or resident birds. Additionally, the virus may be picked up by predatory birds or raptors if they feed on dead or dying infected wild birds or poultry.” There are many different peculiarities in dealing with the virus, and understanding the situation in an area is particularly important, he observed. Farah Ishtiaq adds that unprotected wetlands are under constant pressure from urbanisation and pollution. With the loss of habitat and increase in poultry, the wildbird and poultry buffer has reduced and increased interaction and exchange of viruses – not just spillover but probably spillback from poultry as well, she said. Kamal Saini, an assistant zoologist at Zoological Survey of India’s High Altitude Regional Centre at Solan, Himachal Pradesh, was part of the team that did an initial survey of Pong Dam wetlands in January following reports of mass death of migratory birds. He observed dead bar-headed geese, pochards, pin-tail, black stilt, sand plovers, mallard, spot-billed duck, coot, common teal, lapwing, among others at Pong. “We saw the bar-headed geese trying to approach the land from the water, fall, squirm for a few minutes, and then drop dead. This was before avian influenza was confirmed. The forest department had put in place restrictions. After the birds die, their carcasses are attacked by predators like stray dogs, black kites, and tawny eagles; they may carry the virus to distant wild and domesticated animals,” Saini told Mongabay-India. So it remains a challenge for the department to bury the carcass before these predators attack them. “Additionally, the bar-headed geese that are unable to reach the bank, and die on the water may pose another threat to humans through consumption of affected fish,” he said. Saini observed that every year thousands of winter migratory birds, such as the bar-headed goose, make a pit stop at Pong Dam and other wetlands on their journey from Central Asia, Tibet, Russia, Siberia, Mongolia and any changes in habitat quality can push them to look for alternative habitats. Bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) is a long-distance migrant to the Indian subcontinent, with its major population breeding in China. There is a small breeding population in Ladakh, Mongolia, and Kyrgyzstan. Migrating bar-headed geese have been reported from many protected and non-protected wetlands of Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Maharashtra. “This year their stoppages at Sukhna lake in Chandigarh were reduced, but they were seen in good numbers in small ponds in Haryana which means that protecting habitat quality even in these small water bodies is critical,” said Saini. Researchers at Bangor University collaborating with a large international team of researchers, reported in 2011 that bar-headed geese can fly up to 6,000 m in only 8 hours while passing over the Himalayan mountain range – a similar intense climb could kill a human without lengthy acclimatisation. “When the birds arrive here they are subjected to fatigue following their long flight and they are more susceptible to the infection,” suspects Bivash Pandav, director, Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), adding that the poultry and piggeries are the most susceptible to the virus. “Most of these wetlands where you see migratory birds are unprotected sites, so involving communities in wetland management is essential,” Pandav told Mongabay-India. Pandav reiterates regular health monitoring and sampling of wild birds in selected wetland spots to get a sense of the disease prevalence and the strains. “Otherwise, we try to do all this when the mortalities occur. At BNHS, we have been capturing and ringing birds in different parts of the country. But we are trying to incorporate the disease monitoring component into our ringing programme. We are looking for financial support for the analysis of the samples,” added Pandav. Banner image:Bar-headed goose in flight over Basai Wetland near Gurugram, Haryana. Photo by T. R.

Under the expanded partnership, CEPI will invest an additional $4.8m to fund the production of clinical trial materials, and the investigation of mucosal immune responses during a Phase 1 trial of the vaccine candidate, which is being supported by the Government of Hong Kong.CEPI recently launched a five-year plan to tackle epidemics and pandemics, which includes an urgent programme of vaccine R&D to strengthen our defences against COVID-19. The focused R&D agenda aims to optimize our current vaccines, address variants of concern, and develop next-generation COVID-19 vaccines which are differentiated from those already in advanced development, and could therefore help to fight COVID-19 in the longer term. This expanded partnership with HKU is the second of CEPI's next-generation vaccine investments, which are designed to develop vaccines that are easier to deliver, and address the needs of a diverse range of populations and settings.The HKU vaccine has several potential advantages which make it a suitable candidate for such CEPI investment. It is unique in the CEPI portfolio in that is delivered intranasally, which could potentially reduce transmission of the virus by stimulating a mucosal response in vaccinated people. In addition, it should be possible to scale production of this vaccine candidate to hundreds of millions of doses. The vaccine platform has the further advantage that it can be easily and rapidly adapted to target emerging variants of COVID-19.It is remarkable that in such a short space of time the world already has multiple safe and effective vaccines which are being rolled out to protect people against COVID-19. But we must also plan for the longer-term management of this virus by continuing to invest in vaccine R&D. I am pleased to expand our partnership with the University of Hong Kong which will further explore the potential of this promising vaccine candidate â the only intranasal COVID-19 vaccine in CEPI's portfolio.Dr. Richard HatchettChief Executive Officer, CEPII am thankful for the continued support from CEPI on our vaccine research. The University of Hong Kong has outstanding researchers in emerging infectious diseases and has made significant contributions in the response to the emergence of COVID-19.I am hopeful that the unique nasal spray COVID-19 vaccine being developed will contribute to the ultimate control of the disease.Professor Xiang ZhangPresident of The University of Hong KongEquitable access to vaccines key to ending the pandemicCEPI and HKU are committed to global equitable access of COVID-19 vaccines and have agreed that this vaccine candidate will be made available to the COVAX Facility for procurement and allocation, if it is proven to be safe and effective. The COVAX Facility aims to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, at all levels of development, that wish to participate. To date, COVAX has delivered vaccines to 50 countries, with the aim of distributing 2 billion doses globally in 2021.University of Hong Kong live-attenuated influenza vaccine platformResearchers at the University of Hong Kong have created a vaccine candidate using a weakened version of the influenza virus and have adapted it to express the surface protein of the COVID-19 virus. This approach has previously been used to develop preclinical vaccine candidates against MERS.âENDSâ About CEPICEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations, launched at Davos in 2017, to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. CEPI has moved with great urgency and in coordination with WHO in response to the emergence of COVID-19. CEPI has initiated 12 partnerships to develop vaccines against the novel coronavirus. The programmes will leverage rapid response platforms already supported by CEPI as well as new partnerships. The aim is to advance COVID-19 vaccine candidates into clinical testing as quickly as possible.Before the emergence of COVID-19 CEPI's priority diseases included Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever virus and Chikungunya virus. CEPI also invested in platform technologies that can be used for rapid vaccine and immunoprophylactic development against unknown pathogens (Disease X).Follow our news page for the latest updates.

We report on the findings of a clinical study in healthy adults designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three dose levels of recombinant influenza vaccine derived from highly pathogenic A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (H7N9) virus adjuvanted with AS03 or MF59 oil-in water emulsions. Most of the six study groups meet the FDA CBER-specified vaccine licensure criterion of 70% seroprotection rate (SPR) for hemagglutination inhibition antibodies to the homologous virus. A substantial proportion of subjects show high cross-reactivity to antigenically distinct heterologous A(H7N9) viruses from the first epidemic wave of 2013. These results provide critical information to develop a pandemic response strategy and support regulatory requirements for vaccination under Emergency Use Authorization.

Since then, influenza A(H7N9) virus was found to be circulating in poultry in China, and until 2017, human epidemics have been reported annually between fall and early spring3. During the fifth epidemic in the winter of 2016–2017, an unprecedented number of human influenza A(H7N9) cases were identified. Genetic and antigenic analyses indicated that more than 90% of the circulating H7N9 viruses belonged to a new group designated Yangtze River Delta lineage, antigenically distinct from the previously dominant Pearl River Delta lineage4. The new group had reduced cross-reactivity with antibodies raised to existing candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) made in 2013, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to update the pandemic influenza vaccine recommendations5. Although the influenza A(H7N9) viruses that emerged in 2013 were characterized by having low pathogenicity in chickens (low pathogenic avian influenza or LPAI), some of the Yangtze River Delta lineage viruses emerging in late 2016 were highly pathogenic for poultry (highly pathogenic avian influenza; HPAI) and caused several human infections3,6. Furthermore, mutations in some A(H7N9) viruses detected in humans resulted in reduced susceptibility to influenza antiviral drugs, increasing the potential public health impact of these viruses7. Consequently, global health authorities convened by the WHO recommended development of CVVs based on a LPAI A/Hong Kong/125/2017-like virus and a HPAI A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016-like virus5, hereafter referred to as A/HK/2017 and A/GD/2016, respectively.The United States (US) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) continuously monitors pandemic risk and prepares to respond to the threat of novel influenza virus outbreaks in the US. To this end, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), has established and maintains the National Pre-Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) comprising adjuvants and pre-pandemic bulk antigens from avian influenza viruses determined to pose a significant risk for a pandemic. In addition, to shorten timelines to make influenza vaccines available to immunize the US population, HHS has supported expansion of domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity, including the use of adjuvanted vaccines, and the licensure of pre-pandemic and seasonal egg-based, cell-based, and recombinant influenza vaccines. While egg- and cell-based novel influenza vaccine antigens have been clinically evaluated with adjuvants AS03 and MF59 to support their deployment for pandemic mitigation under Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17, safety and dose-sparing evidence of these adjuvants with recombinant H7 hemagglutinin (HA) antigens is lacking. The present study closed this gap by evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of adjuvanted influenza H7 vaccine derived from A/GD/2016 utilizing recombinant protein technology that can be used to respond quickly to a pandemic influenza virus. By formulating the recombinant protein vaccine with adjuvants from the NPIVS, the results from this study provide critical insights for the US Government to develop a response strategy for a pandemic emergency.ResultsStudy populationA total of 366 subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to each treatment group (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Subjects received two doses of monovalent recombinant influenza H7 vaccine derived from A/GD/2016 at three antigen dose levels (3.75, 7.5, and 15 µg) adjuvanted with AS03 or MF59 administered 28 days apart. The mean subject age was 35.9 years (range: 18–49 years), 55.2% female (range: 48.4–61.7%), 79.5% white (range: 70.0–86.9%), and 16.4% Black or African American (range: 8.2–28.3%). Treatment compliance was high for both vaccine administrations. All subjects who received at least one vaccine dose were considered part of the safety population, while 339 subjects who received both vaccine doses and completed the primary immunogenicity endpoint at day 50, comprised the immunogenicity per protocol population.Fig. 1: Subject enrollment and randomization are shown by treatment group.The Safety Population consisted of all subjects who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of vaccine. The immunogenicity per protocol population (IPPP) included subjects who received two full doses of randomized vaccine, had valid hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) results at the day 50 visit (primary immunogenicity endpoint), and had no major protocol deviations that might impact the assessment of immunogenicity.Full size imageTable 1 Safety population demographics.Full size tableSafety and tolerabilityThe adjuvanted recombinant H7 vaccines were well-tolerated regardless of antigen dose (Fig. 2 and Table 2), and there was no evidence of increased frequencies of subjects experiencing adverse events (AEs) with increasing dose. In general, the frequencies and distribution of local and systemic AEs were similar between adjuvants. Most solicited local and systemic AEs were considered mild to moderate severity. The most common solicited AE for local reactogenicity was injection site pain (Fig. 2). There were no AEs of special interest or potentially immune-mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs) reported. There were no serious AEs (SAEs) related to vaccination as defined by 21 CFR 312.32(a), and there were no AEs or SAEs that led to study withdrawal. Finally, no significant differences were observed in changes from baseline for clinical laboratory results or vital signs for any of the study groups (data not shown).Fig. 2: Frequency of adverse events by vaccine received.Solicited local reactions at the injection site included pain, induration, and erythema.

The primary immunogenicity objective of the study was to determine seroprotection rates (SPRs) in healthy adults following two doses of adjuvanted recombinant H7 vaccine based on serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers on day 50, defined as an HAI antibody titer ≥1:40 against two representative A(H7N9) influenza viruses which emerged during the fifth epidemic and co-circulated in China: the HPAI A/GD/2016 virus used in the vaccine and LPAI A/HK/2017 virus.In subjects receiving recombinant H7 + AS03, seroprotection was achieved against the homologous vaccine virus (A/GD/2016) in 94.6%, 98.1%, and 100% of subjects receiving a 3.75, 7.5, and 15 µg dose, respectively, with an overall SPR of 97.6% (95% CI: 93.9–99.3%) (Fig. 3a). recombinant H7 + MF59 elicited seroprotection against the vaccine virus in 81.0%, 82.5%, or 82.8% of subjects receiving a 3.75, 7.5, or 15 µg dose, respectively, with an overall SPR of 82.1% (95% CI: 75.5–87.5%) (Fig. 3b). The lower bounds of the 95% CI around the SPR were ≥70% (the FDA SPR criterion for licensure of pandemic influenza vaccines18) in all groups except the 3.75 µg + MF59 group, in which the lower bound of the 95% CI around the SPR was 68.6%. Seroprotection was also observed against the antigenically related A/HK/2017 (H7N9) virus in 85.7%, 96.3%, or 98.2% of subjects receiving recombinant H7 + AS03 at a 3.75, 7.5, or 15 µg dose, respectively, with an overall SPR of 93.4% (95% CI: 88.5–96.6%) and in 63.8%, 61.4%, or 81.0% of subjects receiving a 3.75, 7.5, or 15 µg dose recombinant H7 + MF59, respectively, with an overall SPR of 68.8% (95% CI: 61.3–75.6%) (Fig. 3a, b; green bars).Fig. 3: Seroprotection rates (SPRs) to homologous and heterologous H7N9 influenza viruses.Recombinant H7 vaccination adjuvanted with AS03 (a) or MF59 (b) at 3.75, 7.5, and 15â€‰µg HA doses induced seroprotection on day 50 to homologous A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (H7N9) and heterologous A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (H7N9) fifth epidemic viruses and heterologous A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) first epidemic virus. Data are shown as the proportion of subjects achieving a serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titer of at least 1:40 against the antigen as measured by HAI antibody titers (SPR, seroprotection rate, and 95% CI; vertical bars).Full size imageNotably, adjuvanted recombinant H7 elicited strong cross-reactive antibody responses measured by HAI to the antigenically distant A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) heterologous virus, hereafter referred to as A/SH/2013, from the first epidemic wave. Recombinant H7 + AS03 at a 3.75, 7.5, or 15 µg dose induced seroprotection at day 50 in 76.8%, 79.6%, or 89.3% of subjects, respectively (overall SPR 81.9%, 95% CI: 75.2–87.5%) and in 25.9%, 38.6%, or 44.8% of subjects receiving recombinant H7 + MF59 at a 3.75, 7.5, or 15 µg dose (overall SPR 36.4%, 95% CI: 29.2–44.1%) (Fig. 3a, b; blue bars).As expected, HAI and microneutralization (MN) geometric mean titers (GMTs) against both the A/GD/2016 and A/HK/2017 strains peaked by day 50 but still remained above baseline 6 months later (day 212) for each study group, regardless of antigen dose (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. S1). A modest response to antigen dose escalation was observed, with greater antibody titers corresponding to higher antigen doses. Reverse cumulative percentages for serum HAI titers achieved at day 50 following adjuvanted recombinant H7 vaccination show that antigen dose likely enhances HAI and neutralizing antibody responses within the confines of the quantification limits for the respective assays (Fig. 5a, b; Table 3). Similar trends were observed with MN titers, and MN antibody GMTs correlated closely with HAI antibody GMTs (Supplementary Fig. S1; data not shown). The HAI titers against each of the two fifth epidemic H7N9 strains tested were highly correlated (r = 0.88 or 0.90; p < 0.001) (Fig. 6a, b).Fig. 4: Adjuvanted recombinant H7 at 3.75, 7.5, and 15 µg doses elicits robust antibody responses in all study groups.Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses to homologous A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (H7N9) and heterologous A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (H7N9) fifth epidemic viruses as well as heterologous A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) first epidemic virus (days 1 and 50 only) following AS03-adjuvanted recombinant H7 (a) and MF59-adjuvanted recombinant H7 (b) vaccination.

More recently, the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan was updated to establish delivery of first doses of pandemic vaccine within 12 weeks of a pandemic declaration22. Because recombinant influenza vaccines can proceed on virus sequence alone and do not require prior biosafety assessment and WHO distribution of a candidate vaccine virus to begin manufacturing23,24, the platform is expected to accelerate the time to release of product and thus be critical for a timely and effective pandemic response.Following the first A(H7N9) epidemic in early 2013, clinical studies were quickly launched and showed that two doses of adjuvanted, inactivated egg- or cell-based A/SH/2013 (H7N9) vaccines induced HAI and neutralizing antibody titers to homologous antigen12,14,17. In particular, subjects achieved SPRs of 91%, 81%, and 84% and HAI antibody GMTs of 107.1, 80.9, and 103.4 following two doses of AS03-adjuvanted A/SH/2013 (H7N9) vaccine at doses of 3.75, 7.5, and 15 µg of HA, respectively12. Two doses of MF59-adjuvanted A/SH/2013 vaccine elicited seroprotection in 59%, 58%, and 47% of subjects and HAI antibody GMTs of 33.0, 33.8, and 25.3 at doses of 3.75, 7.5, and 15µg of HA, respectively14. Similar responses were observed in subjects administered two doses of MF59-adjuvanted egg- or cell-based A/SH/2013 (H7N9) vaccine12,17.Since A(H7N9) influenza emerged in February 2013, the WHO has confirmed 1568 cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) as of June 18, 202025. The A(H7N9) epidemic in 2016–2017 in China was unprecedented, with a total of 758 cases and 288 deaths reported26. This, combined with the acquisition of HPAI properties, identification of travel-related cases outside China, the potential loss of protection by the A/SH/2013 (H7N9) vaccine in the US NPIVS, and a high frequency of viruses with reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors (~10%) provided a strong driving force to strengthen the US National preparedness position. Thus, BARDA initiated development and production of new H7N9 influenza vaccine antigens in different manufacturing platforms (egg-based, cell-based, and recombinant) taking into consideration the vaccine composition recommendations of WHO. The HPAI A/GD/2016 H7N9 virus was selected to produce vaccine antigen using the Flublok manufacturing process licensed in the US, by Protein Sciences Corporation.Early antigenic analyses of fifth wave A(H7N9) influenza viruses published by the WHO indicated that the HAI titers of ferret antisera to the A/SH/2013 were substantially lower than the homologous titers5. In contrast, ferret antisera to the newly designated fifth wave CVVs, especially to the HPAI A/GD/2016 virus, were broadly reactive with all contemporary H7N9 viruses, including LPAI and HPAI viruses collected in 2016–2017 from humans and birds. These studies in ferrets led us to expect that recombinant H7 vaccine produced from the HPAI virus sequence would elicit highly cross-reactive antibody responses to a majority of the fifth epidemic emergent viruses in subjects who receive two doses with adjuvant. Furthermore, vaccine formulation with adjuvant may be able to overcome significant antigenic distance as the viruses evolve in subsequent years. In the absence of such viruses, antigenically distant ancestor viruses can be used for this purpose in assays; i.e., viruses that circulated during the first H7N9 epidemics in 2013. Indeed, strong cross-reactive antibody responses were observed to the antigenically distant A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) first epidemic strain suggesting that antibodies elicited by this adjuvanted vaccine may provide adequate protection for viruses evolving antigenically in the coming years. In agreement with these findings, three of six groups achieved seroprotection against the heterologous but antigenically related A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (H7N9) from the fifth epidemic wave. Furthermore, SPRs persisted near or above 70% at 3 months and remained above baseline at 6 months post-vaccination. The cross-reactive immune responses observed here and in other studies27,28,29,30 underscore the importance of continual testing of vaccines for candidate influenza viruses with high risk of pandemic potential. Sera obtained from vaccines that administered the A/SH/2013 (H7N9) antigen did not highly cross-react to fifth epidemic H7N9 viruses (Levine et al., 2017, personal communication), however in this study we show that subjects receiving Recombinant H7 had relatively high cross-reactive antibody responses to the only distantly antigenically related A/SH/2013 (H7N9). This one-way loss of reactivity is not completely understood, but the purity of the recombinant vaccine antigen may have a role. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has several vaccine studies in progress using egg-based H7N9 vaccine derived from the LPAI A/HK/2017 virus, and cross-reactivity data generated will be used to better inform the choice of antigen. More studies are certainly needed and may include vaccines manufactured using multiple platforms, e.g., recombinant, cell-based, and/or egg-based antigens.Taken together, recombinant H7 was safe and well-tolerated, with AEs reported being expected reactions to influenza vaccination, and the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant H7 is comparable to that of the H7N9 vaccines produced in eggs or cells in response to the emergence of these viruses in 2013. While the NPIVS has an important role in a pandemic influenza preparedness and response, it is not the sole solution due to the ever-present antigenic evolution of influenza viruses. Therefore, the US must continue to develop more effective seasonal influenza vaccines and maintain sustainable domestic manufacturing capacity to rapidly produce, release, and deliver several hundred million doses of strain-matched influenza virus vaccines and dose-sparing adjuvant during a pandemic response. In addition, all efforts must continue to develop a universal influenza vaccine with broad and long-lasting immunity to protect from seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses.MethodsStudy designThis was a double-blind, randomized, Phase 2 clinical study (Clinical Trials.gov identifier: NCT03283319; registration date: September 12, 2017) that assessed the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of monovalent influenza recombinant H7 vaccine at three antigen dose levels (3.75, 7.5, and 15 µg) adjuvanted with AS03 or MF59 administered 28 days apart. This study was conducted in healthy male and non-pregnant female adults aged 18–49 years. It was conducted at four clinical research sites in the US between October 2017 and November 2018 in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable regulations. All study-related documents were approved by FDA, BARDA, and an institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from all enrolled subjects.Study vaccineThe vaccine used in this study was recombinant H7, a monovalent H7N9 recombinant HA derived from A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (H7N9) HPAI virus, manufactured under a licensed process in the baculovirus expression vector system by Protein Sciences Corporation (Meriden, CT)31. AS03 adjuvant (GlaxoSmithKline, GSK) and MF59 adjuvant (Seqirus) were provided by the BARDA-managed NPIVS. Vaccines and adjuvants used in this study passed all release tests and met all specifications for both drug substance and final formulated drug product, and data were submitted, reviewed, and are on file as part of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application to FDA for this study. Subjects were randomized to receive one of three antigen dose levels (3.75, 7.5, or 15 μg) mixed 1:1 with adjuvant at the time of vaccination and administered intramuscularly (IM) as a 0.5 mL dose.Safety assessmentThe primary safety endpoints were solicited local or systemic reactogenicity symptoms that occurred within 8 days of each vaccine administration. These reactogenicity symptoms consisted of the following: solicited local reactions at the injection site (erythemaedness, induration/swelling, and pain) and solicited systemic reactions (fever, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and chills). The AEs grading scale followed guidelines established by the Division of AIDS, NIH (i.e., mild, Grade 1; moderate, Grade 2; severe, Grades 3, 4, and 5)32.Secondary safety assessments included unsolicited AEs from the time of the first vaccination through 21 days after the second vaccination. Additionally, venous blood samples for routine clinical laboratory safety evaluations were obtained at screening and 8 days after each of the two vaccinations. Secondary safety assessments included serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended adverse events (MAAEs), and PIMMCs through 13 months following the first vaccine administration.Immunogenicity assessmentSerum was collected prior to vaccination on day 1 and on days 29 (prior to second dose), 50, 121, and 212. HAI and MN assays were performed by Southern Research (Birmingham, AL) using Good Laboratory Practice as previously reported16 against antigenic variants including reassortant homologous A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016xPR8 (CBER-RG7C, H7N9, FDA, Silver Spring, MD) or heterologous A/Hong Kong/125/2017xPR8 (IDCDC-RG56B, H7N9, CDC, Atlanta, GA), and A/Shanghai/02/2013xPR8 (IDCDC-RG32A, H7N9, CDC). The HAI and MN assays were qualified prior to immunogenicity assessment to determine the limit of detection (LOD) and to define the lowest (lower limit of quantitation, LLOQ) and highest (upper limit of quantitation, ULOQ) amount of analyte that could be measured with acceptable precision and accuracy (Table 3). Together, the ULOQ and LLOQ define the range of quantification for the respective assays, and results outside these ranges may be uncertain. Positive controls in the serological assays included ferret antisera to A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016xPR8 (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; Lot # G.21021), A/Hong Kong/125/2017xPR8 (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital; Lot # 633551), and A/Shanghai/02/2013xPR8 (Lot # 61968307) (International Reagent Resource, Manassas, VA). Human serum (Aldrich-Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was included as a negative control in the assays. Briefly, sera were adsorbed with horse red blood cells (HRBCs, Lampire Biological Laboratories, Pipersville, PA) and tested for non-specific agglutination. Agglutinated or partially agglutinated samples underwent RBC adsorption a second time. HRBC-adsorbed serum samples were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDEII, Denka-Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) to inactivate non-specific serum inhibitors. Serial, 2-fold dilutions of the HRBC-adsorbed and heat-inactivated serum were incubated with 4 hemagglutination units of the appropriate influenza virus to allow antigen–antibody binding. An equal volume of 0.5% HRBCs was added to each well. HAI titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited hemagglutination. Sera tested for MN activity were heat-inactivated to remove non-specific inhibitors. Serial, 2-fold dilutions of inactivated serum were incubated with 100 TCID50/50 µl to allow for antigen–antibody binding. MDCK cells (1.5 × 104 cells; London cell line; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were added to each well and incubated overnight. Cells were fixed in 80% acetone-PBS. ELISAs were performed to determine HA-specific IgG endpoint titers, and MN titers were defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that gave 50% neutralization.Statistical analysisSPRs were defined as the proportion of subjects achieving a serum HAI antibody titer ≥40 against homologous antigen, and the 95% exact confidence intervals were determined for each individual group. GMTs and back-transformed 95% CIs based on the t distribution were summarized. The reverse cumulative distribution of GMTs were also plotted. In addition, antibody titers against different virus strains were presented as a scatterplot with a regression line on the log scale, along with the Pearson correlation coefficient and corresponding p-value. For all titer analyses, titer values marked as above the upper LOD were imputed as the upper LOD and titer values marked as below the lower LOD were imputed for titer analyses as half of the lower LOD.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Pharmacists and staff working inside the Winn-Dixie pharmacy on Thursday, Feb. 11, 2021 in Apollo Beach. [ LUIS SANTANA | Times ]By News Service of FloridaPublished March 16, 2021|Updated March 16, 2021TALLAHASSEE — A House health care panel Tuesday approved a proposal that would allow pharmacists to vaccinate children, but only after lawmakers agreed to limit the types of vaccines that could be administered.While the House Professions & Public Health Subcommittee narrowed the bill to only allow pharmacists to administer influenza vaccines to children ages 7 and older, a statewide pediatric medicine association continued to oppose the measure.“We don’t love it, but it’s much better than the underlying bill,” said Doug Bell, a lobbyist for the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.The initial version of the bill, filed by Rep. Juan Alfonso Fernandez-Barquin, R-Miami, would have authorized pharmacists to provide various vaccines to children ages 3 and older. That would have included vaccines needed for school, unless parents seek exemptions, including measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, and meningococcal disease.“There are many children, that’s the only time that they get to see the pediatrician,” Bell told members of the panel. “And that’s the opportunity for the pediatrician to do the well-child exam, behavioral health evaluations, growth and development, child abuse and neglect evaluations.”Florida currently allows pharmacists to administer vaccines to adults, but not children.The Florida Retail Federation, a statewide business group that represents retail pharmacies, preferred the original version of the bill. Jake Farmer, a lobbyist for the group, said Florida pharmacists have been vaccinating children ages 3 and older during the COVID-19 pandemic after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services gave authorization as part of the public health emergency.“Right now, as we sit in this room, Florida pharmacists are able, and are giving, vaccines to individuals 3 and older,” Farmer said. “Our pharmacists, along with Florida retailers, have continued to step up to provide this access to health care, and we appreciate the bill.”With former House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes, making the issue a priority, the Legislature last year broadly expanded pharmacists’ scope of practice, allowing them to enter into collaborative agreements with physicians to treat certain chronic conditions. The 2020 law also allows pharmacists to test and treat patients for influenza, streptococcus, lice, skin conditions and minor, uncomplicated infections. Pharmacists need to have written protocol agreements with physicians to begin testing and treating for those conditions. But the 2020 law didn’t allow pharmacists to vaccinate children.Rep. Tyler Sirois, a Merritt Island Republican who serves on the Professions & Public Health Subcommittee, said he considers the new bill a continuation of last year’s efforts to increase access to affordable health care and make pharmacists part of the state’s front-line workforce.“I think that is going to be important as Florida continues to grow both in age and population,” Sirois said.Similarly, Rep. Michele Rayner, D-St. Petersburg, said she knows pharmacists who have been working in medically underserved and minority communities during the pandemic.“I would love to see this bill even at maybe a later date next session go a little bit further,” Rayner said.In addition to authorizing pharmacists to vaccinate children ages 7 and older, the bill would authorize pharmacists and registered pharmacy interns who have protocol agreements with supervising physicians to administer any vaccines recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or vaccines licensed for use on adults by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The bill also would authorize the state Board of Pharmacy to authorize by rule any additional vaccinations the Food and Drug Administration may approve for use on adults. Current law limits which vaccines pharmacists can administer to adults to a 2015 list approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bill cleared the House panel in a 17-1 vote with Rep Kelly Skidmore, D-Boca Raton, casting the lone dissenting vote.Skidmore said she worried that what is now a narrow approval for influenza vaccinations would eventually be expanded “to everything else.”“I just think a lot of the bills we heard in this committee continue to put something in between a person and their doctor, a patient and their doctor, making the decisions,” Skidmore said. “I have major concerns about children being vaccinated by pharmacists and pharmacy interns.”• • •Tampa Bay Times Florida Legislature coverageGet updates via text message: ConText, our free text messaging service about politics news, brings you the latest from this year's Florida legislative session.Sign up for our newsletter: Get Capitol Buzz, a special bonus edition of The Buzz with Steve Contorno, each Saturday while the Legislature is meeting.We’re working hard to bring you the latest news from the state’s legislative session.

HPAIV detection from feathers had been evaluated for H5N1 or H7N1 HPAIVs. It was suggested that viral RNA loads could be equivalent or higher in samples of immature feather compared to tracheal (TS) or cloacal swabs (CS). We investigated the suitability of feathers for the detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 HPAIV in ducks and geese field samples. In the six H5N8 positive flocks that were included in this study, TS, CS and immature wing feathers were taken from at least 10 birds. Molecular loads were then estimated using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) targetting H5 and M genes. In all flocks, viral loads were at least equivalent between feather and swab samples and in most cases up to 103 higher in feathers. Bayesian modelling confirmed that, in infected poultry, RT-qPCR was much more likely to be positive when applied on a feather sample only (estimated sensitivity between 0.89 and 0.96 depending on the positivity threshold) than on a combination of a tracheal and a cloacal swab (estimated sensitivity between 0.45 and 0.68 depending on the positivity threshold). Viral tropism and lesions in feathers were evaluated by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Epithelial necrosis of immature feathers and follicles was observed concurrently with positive viral antigen detection and leukocytic infiltration of pulp. Accurate detection of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAIVs in feather samples were finally confirmed with experimental H5N8 infection on 10-week-old mule ducks, as viral loads at 3, 5 and 7 days post-infection were higher in feathers than in tracheal or cloacal swabs. However, feather samples were associated with lower viral loads than tracheal swabs at day 1, suggesting better detectability of the virus in feathers in the later course of infection. These results, based on both field cases and experimental infections, suggest that feather samples should be included in the toolbox of samples for detection of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI viruses, at least in ducks and geese.

Wild birds are considered as the natural reservoir that contributes to the spread of the disease, generating occasionally panzootic with massive death of wild and domestic birds and significant economic losses2,3.During winter 2016–2017, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N8, belonging to A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 clade 2.3.4.4b lineage, caused epidemic outbreaks in Europe4. France was the most affected country with more than 6 million culled birds and 484 outbreaks. Free-range foie gras ducks were particularly affected, representing more than 80% of outbreaks5. Epidemiological studies pointed out that poor biosecurity practices, interactions with wild birds and transportation of ducks could have contributed to the spread of the virus within this livestock sector5,6,7,8,9.Classical recommendation for the surveillance of influenza involves the collection of tracheal or oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs on live and dead birds. Samples can be processed individually or pooled to detect Influenza A specific nucleic acid signature, by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), followed by pathotyping for cleavage site identification10,11.Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) differ from low pathogenic AIVs (LPAIVs) by the mutational acquisition of multibasic haemagglutinin cleavage site, that shifts mucosal epitheliotropism to tissue pantropism, leading to systemic diseases with high mortality in gallinaceous species3,12. Since HPAIVs display tissue pantropism, it implies that they could spread in feathers. Accurate detection of HPAIVs from feather samples has been demonstrated for HP Asian H5N1 and H7N1 viruses. These few studies suggest that viral loads detected in immature feathers are equivalent or even higher than those detected on either tracheal or cloacal swabs13,14,15,16,17,18. These results were also confirmed on carcasses of dead birds and detached feathers, suggesting better preservation of viral particles in feathers than in viscera15,19. However, almost all these studies were carried out in the context of experimental infections. Combining different approaches, we investigated the suitability of feather samples from both field and experimental infections to detect clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 HPAIV in ducks.MethodsField cases samplingSix flocks were included in the study based on sudden onset of nervous signs and mortality. These flocks have been tested positive for M and H5 AI genes by RT-qPCR10. Finally, all these flocks were confirmed positive for 2.3.4.4 H5N8 HPAIV between January and March 2017 by the French National Laboratory for Avian Influenza and Newcastle disease, using the official procedures10. They included 4 mule duck flocks (5 to 13 weeks of age), 1 Pekin duck flock (8 weeks of age) and 1 flock of geese (8 weeks of age). In each flock, at least 10 non-clinically affected birds were randomly taken and sampled using tracheal (TS) and cloacal swabs (CS), as well as immature wing feathers (remiges). Mature wing feathers were also collected on geese flock. Skin samples with feathers were harvested following necropsy of clinically-affected ducks (n = 11) and geese (n = 4) and fixed in 10% buffered formalin to investigate viral tropism and feather lesions. On-farm investigations and collection of samples were performed in strict compliance with regulation and biosecurity procedures, with the authorization and supervision of official veterinary services and before implementation of sanitary culling and destruction of carcasses.Animal experimentFor the experiment, twenty 10-week-old mule ducks, clinically healthy and AIV negative, were included in the study, in a BSL3 laboratory with negative pressure isolators, absolute air filtration and more than 2 m2 surface per isolator. Animals were randomly split into four groups to represent the different modalities of transmission. In the first isolator, five ducks were inoculated at day 0 with 106 EID50 H5N8 (A/duck/France/171201g/2017(H5N8)) through choanal instillation (Infected group) with additional 5 non-infected ducks (contact group). Five non-infected ducks were put in an isolator receiving air from the infected group isolator (aerosol group). Five additional non-infected ducks were housed in another isolator into a fully closed system (control group). During the seven following days, ducks were fed and had access to water ad libitum. For each animal, tracheal swabs (TS), cloacal swabs (CS), feather pulp (FP) and blood were sampled at days 0 to check negativity (all samples) and then from day 1 to day 7.Viral isolation and amplificationTo obtain a viral stock for experimental infections, viral isolation and amplification were conducted on feather pulp of an infected mule duck of flock 2 with the highest Cq value on RT-qPCR. For viral isolation, feather pulp was placed in 500 µL of 1X PBS and vortexed for 30 s. Then 150 µL of supernatant at the dilution 1:100 in PBS with penicillin and streptomycin 4X were inoculated to 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs (INRAE PFIE, Nouzilly, France). Eggs were kept at 37 °C in a humidity chamber during 48 h and then placed at 4 °C overnight. Allantoic liquids were harvested and titrated by hemagglutination assay with fresh and washed chicken red blood cells.For viral amplification, a similar passage on embryonated eggs was done on allantoic liquid with the highest hemagglutination assay titer. Embryonated chicken eggs were inoculated with 100 µL of a 1:100 dilution in PBS with penicillin and streptomycin 2X. The viral stock was then aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C. In parallel, the titer of this viral stock was also determined by Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID50) method on MDCK cells and calculated by the Spearman & Kärber algorithm20. All these steps were processed in a BSL3 lab in strict compliance with biosafety procedures. Sequences of amplified A/duck/France/171201g/2017(H5N8) virus, first isolated from a mule duck feather, were deposited on GenBank database under MK208604-MK208610 accession numbers.Histopathology and immunohistochemistryFormalin-fixed cutaneous tissues were routinely processed in paraffin blocks, sectioned at 4 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for microscopic examination. A diagram representing histological structures of avian feathered skin is provided in supplementary data (Suppl. Fig. S1). The number of follicular sections examined per skin section was 8 in average for ducks (n = 11 birds) and 4 for geese (n = 4 birds). Immunostainings were performed on paraffin-embedded skin sections with a monoclonal mouse antibody against Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) (Argene, Sherley, USA, 11–030). Immunohistochemical reaction included an antigen retrieval with pronase 0,05% 10 min at 37 °C, a peroxidase blocking step 5 min at room temperature (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark, S2023) and saturation of non-specific binding sites with normal goat serum (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark, X0907) 25 min at room temperature, before overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-NP antibody at the dilution 1:50. The immunohistochemical staining was revealed with a biotinylated polyclonal goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark, LSAB2 system-HRP, K0675) and the aminoethylcarbazole chromogen of the HRP (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark, AEC + Substrate-Chromogen, K3469). Negative controls included sections incubated either without specific primary antibody or with another monoclonal antibody of the same isotype (IgG2). Histopathological analyses were carried out by three veterinary pathologists certified by the European College of Veterinary Pathologists (ECVP).RNA extraction and RT-qPCRAll samples were processed in BSL3 laboratory until lysis in strict compliance with biosafety procedures. Swabs were placed in 500 µL of 1X PBS and vortexed for 30 s. Feather pulp was stored in 500 µL of 1X PBS and then vortexed for 30 s before RNA extraction. For experimental infected group, additional 30–60 mg feather pulp were concurrently incubated in 200 µL PBS 1X containing 0,8 µg/µL of proteinase K (Thermo fisher #EO0492) for 20 min at 37 °C to compare RNA extraction yields with and without proteinase K. For all sample types, RNA was extracted from 140 µL of supernatant with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen #52906) and then kept at − 80 °C.RT-qPCR was performed on 2 µL RNA using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad #172–5125). M and H5 genes were targeted with M52C / M253R primers for M gene21, and H5_HP_EA_F2 (5′-TCCTTGCAACAGGACTAAG-3′) / H5_HP_EA_R (5′-GTCTACCATTCCYTGCCA-3′)22. Absolute quantification was performed with a plasmid range from 102 to 107 copieseaction (2 µL). RT-qPCR reaction and results interpretation were performed on a LightCycler 96 instrument (Roche).Droplet digital PCRFor cDNA synthesis, 5 µL of RNA extracted from swabs and feather pulp (from field cases flock 2) were processed according to the instructions of the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific #15255146). As negative controls, 5 μL of Milli-Q water was processed in parallel. A 2 μL aliquot of the cDNA from the reverse transcription step of samples and controls were used for PCR amplification with the QX200 ddPCR EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad 1864033) and M and H5 primers previously described. ddPCR were processed according to the instruction for QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad) established by the Transcriptomic platform from Genotoul (Get-Santé INSERM I2MC Toulouse). Analyses were performed with the dedicated software Quantsoft (Bio-Rad).Bayesian data analysisTo estimate the sensitivity and the specificity of detection in the three different sample types (cloacal swab, tracheal swab and feather pulp) at the individual level, we used a latent class modelling approach embedded in a Bayesian framework. This type of analysis has been extensively used to model cross-detection of individuals whose true epidemiological status (infected or not) is assessed using imperfect diagnostic tests of unknown sensitivity and specificity23. To do so, we defined five thresholds of test positivity (5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 copies of RNA/μL), and derived the observed frequency of the 23 = 8 different combinations of individual test results for each threshold. The combination of test results was assumed to be distributed according to a multinomial distribution of parameters n = 61 birds and eight probabilities, expressed as a combination of seven parameters to be estimated, i.e. the proportion of infected birds in the sample and the sensitivity and specificity of detection in the three different sample types. The sensitivity and specificity parameters were assumed to be threshold-specific (leading to 30 parameters, 6 for each of the five thresholds of positivity) while the proportion of infected birds was considered the same irrespective of the threshold. The value of the 31 parameters was estimated in a Bayesian framework. We allocated uniform prior distributions for the proportion of infected birds and all sensitivity parameters. All specificity parameters were assigned an informative beta prior distribution to reflect that we were 97.5% and 50% confident that the true value of the specificity parameters were greater than 0.8 and 0.98, respectively.Approval for animal experimentsThis study was carried out in compliance with European animal welfare regulation. The protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee “Comité d’éthique en Science et Santé Animales—115”, protocol number 13205-2018012311319709.ResultsIntegument lesions and virus detection of field cases in H5N8-infected ducks and geeseDuck skin sections consisted of a mixture of immature and mature feathers, whereas geese presented a majority of immature feathers. Lesions were observed in immature feathers in 91% of ducks and 50% of affected geese (Table 1, Fig. 1A). Mature feathers were within normal limits for all subjects. In ducks, lesions were consistent with focal to extensive necrosis of feather (64%) and follicular (73%) epidermis in association with leukocytic infiltration of feather pulp (91%), including predominantly lymphocytes and plasma cells, and fewer macrophages and heterophils. Necrosis was predominant in the outer (corneal) layer and could be observed from early to late stage of feather epithelium differentiation, including early and late barb ridges and marginal plates (Fig. 1B). Variable amount of leukocytic infiltration including lymphocytes, plasma cells and heterophils were observed in the follicular dermis in 73% of ducks. In geese, lesions were less frequent: half of the subjects presented leukocytic infiltration of pulp and necrosis of feather epidermis (50%) and one subject presented epidermal focal necrosis in follicular epidermis (25%).Table 1 Proportion of naturally H5N8-infected ducks and geese with histopathological lesions and positive viral detection in immature and mature feathers.Full size tableFigure 1Lesion and viral detection in immature and mature feathers of naturally H5N8-infected ducks and geese.

(B) Growing and differentiating feather epidermis, duck infected with H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4b. (B1) At early stage of differentiation, feather epidermis is stratified. Necrosis is visible at the outer (corneal) layer (arrow) with viral antigen colocalization. (B2) At the stage of early differentiation, necrosis and single-cell necrosis/apoptosis can be seen within marginal plates and barb ridges (arrowhead) and with viral antigen colocalization. (B3) At the stage of cornication, keratinized barbs and barbules are disrupted and intermixed with necrotic cells and debris (asterisk) with viral antigen colocalization.Full size imageIn immature feathers, viral antigen was detected in all ducks and geese samples, mainly in feather and follicular epidermis. Viral antigen immunostaining was patchy to diffuse in distribution and severely intense in the outer (corneal) layer epidermis and necrotic areas (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, viral antigen was commonly detected at all levels of feather epithelial differentiation in ducks and geese, including barb ridges, marginal plate, barbs and barbules (Fig. 1B). In mature feathers, 91% of ducks presented immunostaining of follicular epidermis (corneal layer) without associated lesions (Fig. 1A). In ducks, viral antigens were occasionally detected in mesenchymal cell in feather pulp (64%) and follicular dermis (73%).In all six duck flocks included in the study, RNA loads of HPAIV in feather pulp were at least equivalent and in most cases up to 103 higher than those detected in either TS or CS (Fig. 2). Incubation of swabs with proteinase K was assessed on a few samples and did not result in a significant increase in detectability (Suppl. Fig. S2). For a given positivity threshold, feather pulp tested positive much more frequently than TS or CS (Suppl. Table T1). A latent class modelling approach was used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of RNA detection in each sample type (feather pulp, CS and TS). Irrespective of the threshold of positivity (5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 copies of RNA/μL), the sensitivity of RNA detection by RT-qPCR in feather pulp of infected birds was much higher than in TS or CS, while the specificity did not substantially drop (Fig. 3). As an example, for a positivity threshold of 10 copies of RNA/mL, the sensitivity of the detection in feather pulp was estimated at 0.96 (95% credible interval (95% CI) 0.86–1.00), while the sensitivity of detection in tracheal swabs and cloacal swabs were estimated at 0.46 (95% CI 0.32–0.60) and 0.31 (95% CI 0.19–0.45), respectively.Figure 2Viral RNA loads in feathers (F), tracheal swabs (TS) and cloacal swabs (CS) in 6 naturally infected flocks with H5N8 HPAIV. Mule ducks (4 flocks, n = 10 birds per flock), pekin ducks (1 flock, n = 11) and geese (1 flock, n = 10). Results are expressed as log10 viral RNA copies/µL.Full size imageFigure 3Estimated sensitivity (left panel) and specificity (right panel) of the three different sample types (feather sample, tracheal swab and oropharyngeal swab) for 5 different thresholds of positivity (5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 copies of RNA/µL).Full size imageAs shown in Table 2, testing one sample of feather pulp was even shown to be more sensitive (Se = 0.96 (95% CI 0.86–1.00)) than the classical sampling recommendation, involving the combination of one tracheal swab and one cloacal swab (Se = 0.63 (95% CI 0.51–0.75) for a positivity threshold of 10 RNA copies/mL). To further confirm the quantitation in tissues, a Droplet Digital PCR assay, using the same primer set, was implemented on a subset of samples. This assay showed a substantial correlation with RT-qPCR data and confirmed significant viral loads in feathers (Suppl. Fig. S3).Table 2 Comparison of the detectability of the infection for each threshold of positivity between a sampling strategy involving one feather only and a sampling strategy involving a tracheal swab and an oropharyngeal swab (in which case an animal tested positive is defined by a positive result for at least one of the two swabs).Full size tableDynamics of HPAIV detection in feathers and swabs in experimentally infected ducksExperimental infection resulted in totally asymptomatic infections in all birds, despite viral RNA detection in swabs and feathers starting from day 1 post-infection (Fig. 4) and RT-qPCR Ct values as low as 16 in some birds at peak of infection (data not shown). Control birds remained virus negative throughout the study. Three direct contact ducks became positive in tracheal swabs as early as day 1 post-infection and by day 3 post-infection, they were all positive in all sample types. Regarding birds connected through aerosols, some became positive at day 3 post-infection, with two positive feather samples, five positive tracheal swabs and three positive cloacal swabs, and they were all positive in all sample types by day 5 post-infection. Viral loads were always substantially higher in tracheal than cloacal swabs. For feather samples, viral loads were equivalent or substantially higher than tracheal and cloacal swabs at day 3, 5 and 7 post-infection, but not at day 1 post-infection when compared with tracheal swabs of infected and contact groups (Fig. 4). The peak of viral excretion occurred between day 3 and 5 post-infection and the relative viral loads in feathers increased, becoming obviously higher than tracheal and even more, cloacal swabs from day 5 post-infection until the end of the course of infection (Fig. 4).Figure 4Viral RNA loads in experimentally H5N8-infected 10-week-old mule ducks.Virus loads in feathers (F), tracheal swabs (TS) or cloacal swabs (CS) were determined from day 1 to day 7 post-infection for infected (pink), contact (yellow) and aerosol (blue) groups. Absolute quantification was performed by RT-qPCR targeting the viral M gene from extracted RNAs in parallel with an M gene plasmid range. Each dot represents an individual value and horizontal bars correspond to means. limit of detection for each experiment.Full size imageDiscussionThe present study investigated the suitability of HPAIV H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4b viral detection in feathers with histopathological correlates in ducks and geese. Previous studies focused on the pathology and detectability of H5N1 and H7N1 HPAIVs in the integument after experimental infections of ducks, chicken and geese13,14,15,16,17,18,19. To the best of our knowledge, the present data provide new insights about HPAIV detection in feather for H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4b through both naturally occurring field cases and experimental challenges.Our data support previous findings that HPAIVs can replicate in feathers and induce feather folliculitis. Ducks presented epithelial necrotizing folliculitis in immature (growing) feathers, with concurrent viral antigenic detection. This lesional pattern supports a strong tropism for feather and follicular epidermis, corneal outer layers in particular, confirming previous descriptions24,25,26. In 91% of ducks, a marked leukocytic, lymphoplasmacytic rich, infiltration was observed in the feather pulp, which contrasts with previous experimental infections of ducks with Indonesian strain of H5N1, where no inflammatory lesions were found in association with epithelial necrosis24. Viral detection in leukocytes was uncommon, more frequent in mesenchymal stromal cells of dermal structures as previously reported25. In geese, no major lesion pattern dominated and half of the subjects had feathers within normal limits.Interestingly, cell death with concomitant viral antigens could be detected at different stages of feather epithelial differentiation, from the early stage up to cornifying barbs, barbules of ducks and geese. Because viral replication seems to occur into feather structures intended to be external, these data suggest that growth and differentiation of feathers epidermis could be a source of viral production for pantropic H5N8 Clade 2.3.4.4b and could potentially carry and disseminate viral particles. The role of feathers in environmental dissemination of avian influenza viruses has been suggested, including in wild waterfowl19,27. Viral infectivity and RNA detectability in feathers detached from bodies has been experimentally investigated in ducks and revealed that HPAIV (H5N1) can longer persist compared to drinking water and feces, for 160 days at 4 °C and 15 days at 20 °C19. Additionally, a study conducted on wild waterbirds has suggested that preen oil increases AIVs survivability on feathers and can act as protection for viral particles27. Altogether, these data indicate that feathers could be a source of environmental contamination. It would be interesting to compare feather infectivity potential between species, since we can presumably predict higher infectivity for species showing an epitheliotropic viral expression in feather compared to chicken where viral expression is endotheliotropic and restricted to the dermal pulp, confined in the calamus. Further studies are needed to confirm this significance of feathers in the epidemiology of avian influenza.Viral loads and tropism may vary greatly during the course of infection in a same bird, which could impact greatly the efficiency of different samples15. In our field investigations, flocks were sampled at day 1 to 7 after the onset of clinical signs and/or mortality, as notified by the farmer or the attending veterinarian. In all batches, viral loads in feathers were higher than in swabs, regardless of this estimated stage of infection. In controlled conditions, as during our experimental infection, viral loads in feathers increased during infection, suggesting that feathers may not be the most relevant samples at the very early stage of the infection (day 1 post-infection).Classical recommendation for the surveillance of influenza involves the collection of tracheal or oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs on live and dead birds10,11. According to our results, the sensitivity of combining one tracheal and one cloacal swab to test for the presence of viral RNA in an infected duck would be 0.63 (0.51–0.75) for a positivity threshold of 10 copies/mL. It is striking that only one feather pulp sample outperform the classical sample recommendation, as its sensitivity was estimated at 0.96 (0.86–1.00). Moreover, feathers are easy to collect, transport and treat for molecular analyses. The much higher sensitivity of detection in feather pulp suggests that feather samples could be diluted without decreasing the overall sensitivity at the flock level, and therefore that they could be pooled further, which would reduce the costs of analysis at the flock scale and improve the overall economic efficiency of surveillance. Combined with swabs in a sampling strategy, feathers would also provide supplementary information about invasiveness of the virus. In a previous experimental study conducted on european quails, H5N1 and H7N1 HPAIVs inoculation resulted in viral RNA detection in feathers from day 1 up to day 6 and day 12, respectively. In contrast, H7N2 LPAIV detection remained negative during all the experiment from 1 to 15 days post-infection28. Assuming that AIV spread in feather is the result of viremia and systemic infection, feather folliculitis in combination with positive viral detection could presumably reflect the tissue pantropism of a virus strain and suggest infection by a HPAIV. Further investigations are needed to investigate feather infection as a signature of HPAIVs, including variations between strains.Clinical expression of HPAI in ducks is poor, as evidenced on the field and in experimental infections29. Our experiment confirmed that ducks may excrete huge loads of virus for days, contaminate very efficiently the rest of the flock without expressing clinical signs. This poor clinical expression in ducks stresses, even more, the pivotal importance of an optimized surveillance strategy, based on intensive testing, at least before farm-to-farm transportation of ducks.These data, based on a selection of both field and experimental cases of H5N8-infected ducks and geese, suggest that feather samples should be included in the toolbox of samples for detection of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI viruses, at least in ducks. Further investigations are needed in experimental settings and on a wide range of HPAIVs to ascertain the relevance of their insertion in the diagnostic protocols of HPAI surveillance.

(Supplied by Mooney's Bay Pharmasave )Social SharingIf you're having trouble remembering the last time you had a cold or flu, you're likely not alone, as pharmacies in Ottawa are reporting a significant drop in sales of medications for these usually common ailments since the start of the pandemic."The demand is really low," said Ahmed Ibrahim, pharmacist and owner of Mooney's Bay Pharmasave. "Sales of cold and flu meds at my store have decreased from previous years, probably by about 50 per cent."Randy Little, co-owner of both the Green Street and Fallowfield Pharmasaves in Barrhaven, said he hasn't seen anything like this in his 20 years as a pharmacist. "The situation is certainly precedent setting," he said. "It's been up and down. At the beginning of the pandemic, I think there were a fair number of patients stockpiling somewhat, but in a good way, in case they had [cold and flu] symptoms."Little suspects measures to prevent COVID-19 spread may have something to do with the seeming drop in the number of flus and colds."People just simply aren't congregating as they normally would be," he said, so "prime conditions for either the cold or flu virus to transmit, those situations aren't as prevalent right now, so perhaps we're seeing a bit less incidence of both flus and colds because of some of those factors." So what happens to all the unsold flu and cold medications that could expire before they leave store shelves? "It depends on each manufacturer and their return policy," said Ibrahim. "Some accept returns and pay you some of the costs, not the full amount. Some don't offer anything and in those situations, we safely discard the medication and lose the money."Impact could be felt next flu seasonThe observations of pharmacists match the numbers Earl Brown, emeritus professor of virology at the University of Ottawa, has been tracking.Brown said data collected by physicians as part of the Canada-wide Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network shows only 60 positive cases of influenza this season, compared to an average of 32,000 positives."Influenza season didn't show up this year," said Brown. "We're all doing distancing, handwashing and mask wearing, and that is very effective protection against catching respiratory infections."'We're all doing distancing, handwashing and mask wearing, and that is very effective protection against catching respiratory infections,' says Dr. Earl Brown, emeritus professor of virology at the University of Ottawa. (Jean Delisle/CBC)According to the federal government's FluWatch website, the number of people who chose to receive the influenza vaccine this season was similar to previous seasons. This year's drastic drop in positive cases could have an impact on next year's cold and flu season."The level of antibodies on average in people will drop somewhat," said Brown. "That means in general we may be a little more susceptible to colds next year. It's not going to be cataclysmic, but you'll expect the population to be a little bit less protected by our antibodies and therefore a little more susceptible to respiratory infections.While there's been a significant drop in sales of cold and flu meds, Little said he has noticed sales are up in another area."We've seen an increase in sales of eye drops, typically the ones used as lubricants," he said, adding this is likely from people spending more time indoors staring at computer and TV screens.Pharmacist Randy Little says he's noticed a boost in demand for eye drops during the pandemic.

COVID-19 has a similar pattern of infection, clinical symptoms, and chest imaging findings to influenza pneumonia. In this retrospective study, we analysed clinical and chest CT data of 24 patients with COVID-19 and 79 patients with influenza pneumonia. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the temperature, systolic pressure, cough and sputum production could distinguish COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the clinical features are 0.783 and 0.747, and the AUC value is 0.819. Univariate analysis demonstrates that nine CT features, central–peripheral distribution, superior–inferior distribution, anterior–posterior distribution, patches of GGO, GGO nodule, vascular enlargement in GGO, air bronchogram, bronchiectasis within focus, interlobular septal thickening, could distinguish COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the CT features are 0.750 and 0.962, and the AUC value is 0.927. Finally, a multivariate logistic regression model combined the variables from the clinical variables and CT features models was made. The combined model contained six features: systolic blood pressure, sputum production, vascular enlargement in the GGO, GGO nodule, central–peripheral distribution and bronchiectasis within focus. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the combined features are 0.87 and 0.96, and the AUC value is 0.961. In conclusion, some CT features or clinical variables can differentiate COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. Moreover, CT features combined with clinical variables had higher diagnostic performance.

The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by this pathogen coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and SARS-CoV-2 infection has since reached pandemic status worldwide. According to the latest statistics from the WHO, it brings the global cumulative numbers to 108.2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, and over 2.3 million death cases since the start of the pandemic1.In winter, influenza is more common than COVID-19. Influenza is a mild-to-severe, contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza viruses. Serious outcomes include hospitalization or death, and the elderly, the young, and people with poor health conditions are at a high risk of these complications. The most common form of influenza is seasonal influenza. The two main types of seasonal influenza virus, A and B, are routinely spread among humans and are responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics each year. Influenza accounts for thousands of deaths and hospital admissions annually in the USA, with an even greater impact in developing countries2,3,4,5. COVID-19 and seasonal influenza pneumonia are similar in terms of transmission and symptoms. In both cases, the primary modes of transmission are droplets and contact transmission. Fever, chills, headache, myalgia, malaise, and anorexia accompanied by respiratory symptoms, including nonproductive cough and sore throat, are the main symptoms of both6,7,8. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a highly recommended diagnostic technique. However, some studies have indicated that PCR results are susceptible to false negatives from several factors9,10,11.Some studies have shown that GGO, consolidation with air bronchogram, interlobular septal thickening, centrilobular nodules, and reticular opacities were the main CT manifestations of influenza pneumonia12,13,14. Many studies have revealed the CT features of COVID-19, such as GGO, vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening15,16. COVID-19 is also a viral pneumonia, and its CT features overlap with those of other viral pneumonias12. Recently, studies have compared the differences in chest CT findings between COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia17,18. Their study showed that some CT features of COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia were different. However, their study has some shortcomings, such as less clinical variables, no further analysis of which features have differential diagnostic performance, and no comprehensive analysis of CT features combined with clinical variables.This study aimed to investigate the differential diagnosis between influenza pneumonia and COVID-19 based on CT features combined with clinical variables.Materials and methodsPatientsThis retrospective study was approved and the requirement for informed consent was waived by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The study follows the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki with voluntary participation. The data are analyzed and handled in an anonymous format. We adhere to relevant guidelines and regulations in all experiments.COVID-19 group: we reviewed the records of consecutive patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR assay at our hospital from January 21st, 2020 to February 9th, 2020. Inclusion criteria were availability of complete data from CT examinations; complete medical record; and no coinfection; and absence of other lung diseases, tumor, hypertension, diabetes.Seasonal influenza pneumonia group: we reviewed the records of consecutive patients with influenza virus pneumonia (types A and B) confirmed by nucleic acid testing at our hospital from January 21st, 2020 to February 9th, 2020. Inclusion criteria were the same as those for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.The clinical variables included sex, age, exposure history (Wuhan travel history or close contact with confirmed patients with COVID-19), smokers, alcoholics, days from illness onset, temperature, respiratory rate, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, oxygen saturation, and symptoms (fever, rigor, chills, cough, sputum production, chest, tightness, dyspnea, sore throat, fatigue, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea).CT image acquisitionChest CT was performed on a 128-slice CT scanner (Revolution CT Scanner; GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) dedicated only to patients with COVID-19. The CT protocol was: tube voltage, 120 kV (automatic adjustment); tube current, 200–500 mAs; rotation time, 0.5 s; section thickness, 0.625 mm; collimation, 0.625 mm; pitch, 1; matrix, 512 × 512; and inspiration breath hold.Patients with seasonal influenza pneumonia were imaged by a 128-slice CT scanner (Somatom Definition AS + CT scanner; Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany). The CT protocol was: tube voltage, 120 kV; tube current, 110 mAs (automatic adjustment); rotation time, 0.5 s; section thickness, 0.75 mm; collimation, 0.6 mm; pitch, 1; matrix, 512 × 512; and inspiration breath hold.All scans were obtained with the patient in the supine position during end-inspiration without intravenous contrast material. Reconstruction was performed with a bone algorithm with a thickness of 1 mm and an interval of 1 mm. The following windows were used: a mediastinal window with a window width of 350 HU and a window level of 40 HU and a lung window with a width of 1800 HU and a level of − 400 HU.CT image reviewAll CT images were reviewed by two fellowship-trained cardiothoracic radiologists with approximately 10 years of experience each. Each radiologist was blinded to laboratory assay results and demographic information including date of CT examination and patient name. Images were reviewed independently, and final decisions were reached by consensus. Disagreements were resolved by a third fellowship-trained cardiothoracic radiologist with 15 years of experience.The distribution of lung abnormalities was recorded as: (a) left, right or bilateral lung; (b) predominantly subpleural (involving the peripheral 1/3 of the lung), hilar (involving around the hilum), and random (without predilection for subpleural or around hilum); (c) predominantly superior (superior to the bifurcation of trachea), inferior (inferior to the bifurcation of trachea), and random (without predilection for superior or inferior); (d) predominantly anterior (anterior to the horizontal line across the axillary midline), posterior (posterior to the horizontal line across the axillary midline), and random (without predilection for anterior or posterior); (e) presented as a solitary lesion. Numbers of involved lobes and segments of lungs were recorded also.The CT findings included ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, bronchiolectasis, interlobular septal thickening, and lymphadenopathy. Other abnormalities were noted; for example, cavitation, air bronchogram, reticulation, calcification, subpleural curvilinear line, halo sign, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and pericardial effusion.Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Student’s t-tests or Mann–Whitney U were used to compare two groups according to the data distribution. Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used for the two categorizable comparison. In addition, variables for which more than 30% of values were missing were not included in logistic regression analysis. Firstly, univariate logistic analysis was used for the selection of these variables, and then, those significantly variable in univariate analysis were used for further multivariate logistic analysis by using a stepwise method. For all variables, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated, and, then, diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were determined. A two-tailed p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.IRB statementThis retrospective study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The requirement for informed consent was waived, given the retrospective nature of the study.ResultsThe clinical variablesTwenty-four patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 41 years; 13 men) and 79 patients with influenza pneumonia (mean age, 41 years; 50 men) were enrolled in the study. They were all newly diagnosed patients. The onset time is about 1 week. There were significant differences in exposure history, temperature, respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure between the two groups, but no differences in other variables (Table 1). The temperature and respiratory rate of patients with influenza pneumonia were higher than patients with COVID-19, while the systolic blood pressure was lower than patients with COVID-19.Table 1 The clinical variables in 79 patients with influenza pneumonia and 24 with COVID-19.Full size tableInitial chest CT featuresAll 24 patients with COVID-19 had abnormal findings on initial chest CT. Of the 79 patients with influenza pneumonia, 64 had abnormal initial chest CT images and 15 had normal images. There were significant differences in central–peripheral distribution, superior–inferior distribution, anterior–posterior distribution, number of involved lobes, patches of GGO, GGO nodule, vascular enlargement in GGO, air bronchogram, bronchiolectasis within lesion, and interlobular septal thickening between the two groups, but no differences in other CT features (Table 2).Table 2 Initial chest CT features in 79 patients with influenza pneumonia and 24 with COVID-19.Full size tableOverall, lung lesions in patients with COVID-19 were most likely to appear in the subpleural, inferior, and posterior lung fields, whereas those in patients with influenza are mostly randomly distributed, without obvious regional distribution characteristics. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to have isolated lesions than were patients with influenza. The following CT features were more prevalent in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with influenza (Figs. 1, 2, 3): patches of GGO, GGO nodule, vascular enlargement, air bronchogram, bronchiolectasis, and crazy-paving pattern. Interlobular septal thickening in patients with COVID-19 was more likely to appear within the GGO lesions, whereas in patients with influenza, it was more likely to appear outside the GGO lesions.Figure 1CT image of a 66-year-old man with COVID-19 infection, presenting fever with cough for 7 days, shows multiple GGOs in bilateral lung, mainly distributedin the subpleural areas, with reticular pattern (interlobular septal thickening).Full size imageFigure 2(a, b) A 33-year-old woman with COVID-19 infection, living in Wuhan, presented with fever, rhinocleisis, and dry cough.

Univariate analysis demonstrated that the temperature (OR: 1.581, 95% CI 1.017–2.460), systolic pressure (OR: 1.033, 95% CI 1.003–1.064), cough (OR: 4.582, 95% CI 1.697–12.370) and sputum production (OR: 13.588, 95% CI 2.978–61.997) could distinguish COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the clinical features were 0.783 and 0.747, and the AUC value was 0.819 (Fig. 4).Table 3 Univariate and multivariate analysis of clinical features and CT features for distinguishing COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia.Full size tableFigure 4The performance characteristics of the logistic regression models for diagnosing patients with COVID-19 infection. Orange line, the model based on clinical variables; green line, the model based on CT features; purple line, the combined model with both clinical variables and CT features.Full size imageThen, univariate analysis for the CT features was used for the further screening, and the variables including central–peripheral distribution (OR: 3.103, 95% CI 1.798–5.355), superior–inferior distribution (OR: 2.121, 95% CI 1.107–4.065), anterior–posterior distribution (OR: 2.804, 95% CI 1.373–5.730), patches of GGO (OR: 5.972, 95% CI 1.870–19.075), GGO nodule (OR: 3.046, 95% CI 1.100–8.432), vascular enlargement in GGO (OR: 20.571, 95% CI 6.514–64.966), air bronchogram (OR: 4.917, 95% CI 1.865–12.965), bronchiectasis within focus (OR: 5.973, 95% CI 2.226–16.031), interlobular septal thickening (OR: 2.403, 95% CI 1.362–4.241). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the CT features were 0.750 and 0.962, and the AUC value was 0.927 (Fig. 4).Finally, a multivariate logistic regression model combined the variables from the clinical features and CT features models. The combined model contained six features: systolic blood pressure (OR: 1.043, 95% CI 1.003–1.083), sputum production (OR: 11.525, 95% CI 2.109–62.981), vascular enlargement in the GGO (OR: 237.61, 95% CI 6.784–8322.545), GGO nodule (OR: 9.243, 95% CI 1.256–67.995), and central-peripheral distribution (OR: 8.371, 95% CI 2.287–30.645) and bronchiectasis within focus (OR: 100.120, 95% CI 1.311–7529.702). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the combined features were 0.87 and 0.96, and the AUC value was 0.961 (Fig. 4).DiscussionInfluenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection cause similar clinical symptoms, and both can cause viral pneumonia. RT-PCR is the most convenient and accurate method to identify the two respiratory viruses. However, there is a possibility of false negative in RT-PCR detection for various reasons, such as non-standard specimen collection. However, the chest CT findings of viral pneumonia are similar and overlapping, which is not enough to accurately distinguish the two kinds of viral pneumonia12.Exposure history is very important, and there have been a lot of studies that have emphasized this issue7,19,20,21,22. In our study, all 24 patients with COVID-19 had exposure, whereas all 79 patients with influenza pneumonia had no exposure. However, since the time of the case reviewed was the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic, Chengdu is more than 1000 km away from Wuhan, and the government implemented strict measures to restrict the movement of people, we believe that the exposure history of the cases in this study may have a serious bias. Based on this, this study did not consider the factor of exposure history when constructing the diagnostic model.So far, many virological, pathogenesis, pathological and pathophysiological studies have gradually lifted the veil of COVID-19 for us23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33, and may also explain the differences in clinical and CT features between influenza pneumonia and COVID-19 showed by our study.Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been established as the functional host receptor for SARS-CoV-228,29,30,31. ACE2 is abundantly expressed in a variety of cells residing in many different human organs. ACE2 is a pivotal counter-regulatory enzyme to ACE by the breakdown of angiotensin II, the central player in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and the main substrate of ACE228,29,30,31. In this study, systolic blood pressure was higher in patients with COVID-19 than in those with influenza pneumonia. We speculate that the reason is that ACE2 cannot bind to the substrate Ang II due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may accompany the virus to enter the cell interior, resulting in increased blood pressure and vasoconstriction.Since mucus is a fundamental mechanism to defense against allergens and pathogens, its production increases in the respiratory tract in nearly every instance of airway inflammation. The cytokine storm in COVID-19 is particularly potent for the build-up of mucus due to the onset of several inflammatory cascades associated with mucus production34. Patients with COVID-19 had less sputum than patients with influenza pneumonia. This was caused by the pathological changes of COVID-19. In the lungs of COVID-19, terminal bronchi were obstructed by bronchial exudate, viscous secretions, and inflammatory exudate23,24,25,26,27. Such pathological changes rarely occur in influenza pneumonia.The most obvious manifestation of COVID-19 in the lungs is the diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), with its congestion, proliferation and organising phases paradoxically juxtaposed, giving a picture of ‘temporal heterogeneity’32,35,36. The pathological changes in this stage include dilation and congestion of alveolar septal capillaries, exudate in alveolar cavity, and interstitial edema in interlobular septum. And vascular features were distinctive of COVID-19 and consisted of severe endothelial injury, widespread thrombosis with microangiopathy, alveolar capillary microthrombi, and neoangiogenesis37. This leads to patches of GGO, GGO nodule, vascular enlargement in GGO, air bronchogram, bronchiectasis within focus, and interlobular septal thickening on chest CT images of COVID-19.The SARS-CoV-2 virus, with a diameter of 60–140 nm19, can easily reach the periphery of the lung and, as does SARS, bind to ACE2 receptors in the bronchioles, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli. This binding explains why the lesions associated with COVID-19 are mainly distributed in the periphery of the lung at least at the beginning of the infection. In contrast, the α2,6-linked sialic acid-bearing receptors, to which human influenza viruses preferentially bind, are abundant in the upper and lower respiratory tract of humans, particularly in tracheobronchial epithelium and type I alveolar cells38. Therefore, the influenza pneumonia lesions were not distributed mainly in the peripheral lung but in the central or the whole lung.Several studies have compared the differences in CT features between influenza pneumonia and COVID-1917,18. But their results were not entirely satisfactory. Although there were not many cases in our study, we have observed many clinical variables and CT indicators and carried out regression analysis, and the results have high diagnostic performance, especially the integrated model combining CT features and clinical variables.There are some limitations to our research. Our study was a single-center study. Not all patients were followed up to full recovery because some were later referred to infectious disease hospitals in our area. Pediatric, pregnant, and perinatal cases were not included because our hospital does not have a pediatric or an obstetrics and gynecology department. The small sample prevented validating the combined model. Therefore, we cannot be completely confident in the diagnostic performance of this model but hope to include more COVID-19 cases in the future. We plan to conduct a prospective, multicenter study, including more cases, to further determine the differences between COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia.In conclusion, some CT features or clinical variables can differentiate COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. Moreover, CT features combined with clinical variables had higher diagnostic performance. ReferencesWHO.

In early 2013, novel H7N9 influenza viruses emerged in China that caused about 1600 human cases of infection with a high associated case fatality rate. In this study, two H7N9 split virion vaccines with or without AS03 adjuvant were tested in the naive ferret model. Serological analyses demonstrated that homologous hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization antibody titers were detectable in the ferrets after the first immunization with the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines that were further boosted by the second immunization. In addition, heterologous antibody titers against older H7 subtype viruses of the North American lineage (H7N7, H7N3) and newer H7 subtype viruses of the Eurasian lineage (H7N9) were detected in the animals receiving the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines. Animals receiving two immunizations of the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines were protected from weight loss and fever in the homologous challenge study and had no detectable virus in throat or lung samples. In addition, microscopic examination post-challenge showed animals immunized with the AS03-adjuvanted vaccines had the least signs of lung injury and inflammation, consistent with the greater relative efficacy of the adjuvanted vaccines. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 vaccines elicited high levels of homologous and heterologous antibodies and protected against H7N9 virus damage post-challenge.

In addition to seasonally occurring human infections, zoonotic infections caused by avian influenza A viruses are a major public health concern and pose a pandemic threat. In 2013, an avian H7N9 virus strain emerged in China that caused hundreds of human infections. From 2013 to 2017, the H7N9 virus led to annual epidemics. During these five waves of epidemics ~1600 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, coupled with a case fatality rate of almost 40%2. Human infections with H7N9 viruses occurred each year and the viruses gained virulence markers that potentially enhance the risk for humans and may have increased their spread into the human population, making this virus a notable pandemic threat3,4. During the fifth wave of H7N9 epidemics the virus split into two phylogenetically distinct lineages, the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta clades5. Ferret antisera raised against existing candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) showed reduced cross-reactivity against these novel H7N9 viruses6. In addition, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N9 viruses emerged that featured a polybasic cleavage site in the hemagglutinin (HA) and were lethal for poultry7,8. However, no community transmission has been reported and infections occurred almost exclusively after exposure to infected poultry. Nevertheless, the large number of human cases increased the likelihood of genetic reassortment of H7N9 viruses with human seasonal influenza viruses, which could lead to sustained human-to-human transmission9. In China, cases of people co-infected with both H7N9 and seasonal influenza virus strains have been reported during the period of overlapping seasonal and H7N9 epidemics10. In addition, an avian H7N2 virus caused an outbreak in cats in an animal shelter in New York that led to one human case11.Humans are immunologically naive to H7 subtype viruses and possess little to no pre-existing, humoral immunity12. Currently, there is no licensed H7N9 vaccine available and people infected with H7N9 viruses are only treated therapeutically with neuraminidase inhibitors. However, H7N9 is quickly acquiring resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors13 which is leading to an unreliable public health strategy to combat this virus. To provide more effective protection, vaccines are urgently needed. A phase I/II trial investigating a pre-pandemic H7N9 vaccine, that is also being evaluated in the present study, showed promising results in eliciting robust immune responses in healthy adults, but it is unknown if this vaccine can induce cross-reactive antibody responses against recent fifth wave H7N9 viruses and elicit protective efficacy upon live virus challenge14. In this study, H7N9 split virion vaccines, produced at two different GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) production sites (Quebec (Q) and Dresden (D)), are being evaluated. In context of pandemic preparedness, testing of vaccines produced in different regions of world is of importance and contributes to global preparedness efforts.Ferrets are highly susceptible to influenza virus infection, show clinical symptoms similar to humans and are the preferred animal model to provide evidence of efficacy of influenza virus vaccines especially against highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses15,16. Previous preclinical studies in the ferret model have shown that protective immune responses against homologous and heterologous infection with H5N1 viruses can be induced with low doses of H5N1 inactivated split virion vaccines adjuvanted with AS03 (an adjuvant system containing α-tocopherol and squalene in an oil-in-water emulsion). The use of AS03 adjuvant reduced the required dose of HA antigen and resulted in higher and cross-protective immune responses15,17. An AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 split virus vaccine (produced at the GSK Quebec site) has been licensed by FDA for human use, however, there is no FDA approved H7N9 vaccine available yet.The present study was designed to evaluate the potential of AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013 vaccines to induce humoral immunity to a panel of H7 viruses and protection against vaccine-homologous challenge with wild-type H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013 virus in the naive ferret model.ResultsImmunization with AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 split virion vaccines induced homologous and heterologous antibody responsesFemale ferrets (n = 8 per group) were immunized with non-adjuvanted standard-dose H7N9 vaccines or AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 vaccines twice 21 days apart. Blood for serological testing was taken before the first immunization and after the first (prime) and second (booster) immunizations. The experimental overview, vaccination groups, and virus strains used for vaccination, serological testing, and virus challenge are shown in Fig. 1. The antigenic relationship between the vaccine strain virus and the virus strains used for testing is shown in Supplementary Table 1.Fig. 1: Immunization overview and phylogenetic tree.a Experimental overview. Ferrets were immunized on day 0 and day 21 with AS03-adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted H7N9 split virion vaccines. The placebo group received PBS. The animals were bled for serology on days 0, 21, and 49. On day 49, the animals were challenged with a wild-type H7N9 virus. b Treatment groups. The five different treatment groups are shown. Two groups (n = 8/group) were immunized twice with non-adjuvanted standard-dose Q-H7N9 or D-H7N9 vaccine, respectively. Two groups (n = 8/group) were immunized twice with AS03-adjuvanted half-dose Q-H7N9 or D-H7N9 vaccine, respectively, and eight animals were injected with PBS. c Phylogenetic tree. North American lineage and Eurasian lineage H7 HAs are shown with H3 HA (A/Hong Kong/4801/2014) as an outgroup. The vaccine strain H7 HA is indicated with a pink closed circle, the H7 strains used for serological testing (HI, VN, ELISA) are highlighted with stars and the H7N9 challenge virus is marked with a square. The scale bar (0.06) indicates the percent difference based on amino acid sequences.Full size imageFunctional antibody titers specific for H7 HA were determined in hemagglutination inhibition (HI; Fig. 2) and virus neutralization assays (VN; Fig. 3) against the homologous H7N9 vaccine strain and antigenically heterologous H7N7 and H7N3 viruses, which circulated prior to the strain selected for the vaccines. On the day of the first immunization (day 0), all ferrets were HI-negative with titers of 5 against the tested viruses. All animals in the non-adjuvanted standard-dose HA groups had non-detectable HI titers after the first immunization at day 21 against the four viruses tested (Fig. 2). After the second vaccination, some animals had detectable HI titers against homologous H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus with a reciprocal geometric mean titer (GMT) of 7 in the Q-H7N9 and 12 in the D-H7N9 group. Three animals had detectable HI titers against H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013, but no HI-active antibodies were induced in the non-adjuvanted standard-dose HA groups against heterologous H7N7 and H7N3 viruses, except for one animal against H7N3 virus after two immunizations in the non-adjuvanted D-H7N9 group (Fig. 2c, d).Fig. 2: Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against homologous H7N9 viruses and heterologous H7N3 and H7N7 viruses.HI titers against H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013 (a), H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013 (b), H7N7 A/Netherlands/219/2003 (c), and H7N3 A/mallard/Netherlands/12/2000 (d) are shown on the y-axis. The dashed gray line indicates an HI titer of 1:40. The x-axis shows the timepoints (day 0, 21, 49) and the treatment groups are indicated. The dashed gray line at an HI titer of 1:10 represents the limit of detection.Full size imageFig. 3: Microneutralization titers (VN) against homologous H7N9 viruses and heterologous H7N3 and H7N7 viruses.VN titers against H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013 (a), H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013 (b), H7N7 A/Netherlands/219/2003 (c), and H7N3 A/mallard/Netherlands/12/2000 (d) are shown on the y-axis. The x-axis shows the timepoints (day 0, 21, 49) and the treatment groups are indicated. The dashed gray lines represent the limit of detection.Full size imageIn contrast, almost all ferrets primed with the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose HA vaccines seroconverted (as defined by a reciprocal HI titer of 40 or higher) against homologous H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013 and A/Anhui/1/2013 virus. Notably, six animals (2/8 in Q-H7N9 and in 4/8 D-H7N9 AS03-adjuvanted half-dose HA group) seroconverted against heterologous H7N3 virus after a single immunization, whereas only five ferrets (1 in Q-H7N9 and 4 in D-H7N9) had a rise in HI antibodies against H7N7 virus. These titers were strongly boosted after the second immunization, reaching high reciprocal GMTs of 666 (Q-H7N9) and 788 (D-H7N9) against A/Shanghai/2/2013 and 629 (Q-H7N9) and 635 (D-H7N9) against A/Anhui/1/2013 H7N9 virus at day 49 post-second immunization (Fig. 2a, b). All animals showed an increase in HI titer against heterologous H7N7 virus, with all but three animals (2 in Q-H7N9 and 1 in D-H7N9 group) seroconverting at day 49 (reciprocal GMT of 51 in Q-H7N9 and 95 in D-H7N9 group). Sera tested against heterologous H7N3 virus showed that all animals seroconverted, resulting in reciprocal GMTs of 157 and 167 for Q-H7N9 and D-H7N9, respectively. Serum samples from the animals receiving PBS placebo were HI-negative against all viruses at all timepoints (Fig. 2a–d).Next, virus-neutralizing (VN) responses against the same viruses were measured (Fig. 3). A priming immunization with non-adjuvanted standard-dose HA vaccines did not induce VN responses against the viruses, but after a booster immunization, VN responses could be detected against homologous H7N9 viruses in a few ferrets (Fig. 3a, b) with reciprocal GMTs of ~10 (both A/Shanghai/2/2013 and A/Anhui/1/2013). Similar to the HI responses, a priming immunization with AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 vaccines induced a rise in VN antibodies against H7N9 viruses in all ferrets. These titers increased after the booster immunization, reaching reciprocal GMTs of 731 and 534 for A/Shanghai/2/2013 and A/Anhui/1/2013, respectively, in the animals receiving Q-H7N9. Immunization with AS03-adjuvanted half-dose D-H7N9 boosted the titers to reciprocal GMTs of 608 (A/Shanghai/2/2013) and 622 (A/Anhui/1/2013). None of the PBS placebo-treated ferrets had detectable VN titers. Heterologous neutralizing antibody responses were weaker, resulting in reciprocal GMTs of 51 (Q-H7N9) and 88 (D-H7N9) against H7N7 (A/Netherlands/219/2003) and 203 (Q-H7N9) and 245 (D-H7N9) against H7N7 (A/mallard/Netherlands/12/2000) in the group receiving the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 vaccines twice (Fig. 3c, d).These results support and highlight the beneficial effects of adding the AS03 adjuvant to the H7N9 vaccines in order to increase the immunogenicity of an H7 HA vaccine antigen, to increase the breadth of the functional antibody response, and to enable an antigen-sparing vaccine approach.Immunization with AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 split virion vaccines induced antibodies reactive toward fifth wave H7N9 viruses and a North American lineage H7N2 virusCross-reactive antibody responses were further investigated in the ferrets receiving the adjuvanted vaccines (half-dose HA + AS03) (Fig. 4). For the HI and VN assays, two fifth wave H7N9 viruses, including one representative virus from each of the new fifth wave clade (Pearl River Delta clade, Yangtze River Delta clade), and a feline H7N2 virus were used6,11. These viruses circulated more recently than the virus strain used in the vaccine and are antigenically distinct from the vaccine strain virus (Supplementary Table 1). In addition, the feline virus is from a different genetic HA lineage than the vaccine strain. All animals receiving the AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 vaccines developed HI and VN antibody titers against fifth wave H7 viruses (Fig. 4a, b, d, e). At day 49, the animals receiving the Q-H7N9 vaccine developed a reciprocal HI GMT of 80 and a reciprocal VN GMT of 293 against A/Hunan/02285/2017 (Yangtze River Delta clade) as well as a reciprocal HI GMT of 269 and a reciprocal VN GMT of 761 against A/Hong Kong/2014/2017 (Pearl River Delta clade). The ferrets vaccinated with the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose D-H7N9 vaccine developed similar reciprocal HI GMTs of 87 and reciprocal VN GMT of 349 against A/Hunan/02285/2017 and reciprocal HI GMT of 226 and reciprocal VN GMT of 640 against A/Hong Kong/2014/2017.Fig. 4: Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization titers (VN) against fifth wave H7N9 viruses and a North American lineage H7N2 virus.The HI titers against H7N1 A/Hunan/02285/2017 (a), H7N1 A/Hong Kong/2014/2017 (b), and H7N2 A/feline/New York/16-040082/2016 (c) are plotted on the y-axis. The dashed gray line represents an HI titer of 1:40. The x-axis shows the timepoints (day 0, 49) and the treatment groups are indicated. VN responses against the same viruses are shown in d–f. The y-axis shows the VN titer, the timepoints (day 0, 49) and treatment groups are indicated. The dashed gray line at an HI or VN titer of 1:10 indicates the limit of detection.Full size imageTo test if immunization with a Eurasian lineage H7N9 virus vaccine can also induce antibodies cross-reactive toward a North American lineage H7 virus, we tested a feline H7N2 virus in HI and VN assays (Fig. 4c, f). Immunization with AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 vaccines induced low HI titers with a reciprocal GMT of 15 (Q-H7N9) and 22 (D-H7N9) against H7N2 A/feline/New York/16-040082/2016, but higher reciprocal VN GMTs of 247 (Q-H7N9) and 320 (D-H7N9) against H7N2 A/feline/New York/16-040082/2016, indicating that H7 cross-neutralizing antibodies were generated. Interestingly, we found a larger difference between HI and VN titers for the feline virus, whereas the HI and VN titers for the other viruses tested were rather similar, which might be attributable to different affinities of the viruses to the red blood cells used in this assay.To investigate cross-reactive antibody responses in more detail, IgG binding antibodies were measured by ELISA in the animals immunized with AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 split virion vaccines, which showed robust binding against all tested HAs from the panel of H7 viruses (Supplementary Fig. 1).Immunized ferrets were protected against H7N9 virus challengeTo investigate the protective efficacy of the H7N9 split virion vaccines, the animals were challenged with a sub-lethal dose of wild-type H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013) virus on day 49. The body temperatures were monitored continuously, and nose and throat swabs were collected daily. Body weights were recorded at challenge and on the day of scheduled euthanasia (day 5 post-challenge). The lungs and nasal turbinates were also harvested on the day of scheduled euthanasia (Fig. 5a). The animals receiving the non-adjuvanted Q-H7N9 or D-H7N9 vaccines (standard dose) showed a high mean body temperature starting from 24 to 48 h after challenge (Fig. 5b). In the AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 groups (half-dose) the ferrets showed a slightly elevated mean body temperature after challenge but did not develop fever. The animals in the PBS group had high mean body temperature and fever starting around 24 h after challenge.Fig. 5: Challenge experiment overview, morbidity, and viral titers.a Experimental overview. On day 0 (day 49 post-prime) ferret body temperatures and body weights were measured, and throat and nose swabs taken. The body temperatures were monitored continuously with a 10 min interval until the scheduled day of euthanasia (day 5 post-challenge) and nose and throat swabs were collected daily. On day 5 the body weights were recorded, and the animals were euthanized. Nasal turbinates and lungs were collected for virus quantification and histopathology. b Temperature curves. Body temperature curves (in °C) starting three days before virus challenge until the day of euthanasia (day 5 post-challenge) are shown for the animals receiving non-adjuvanted standard-dose H7N9 split virion vaccines (open circles, open squares), AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 split virion vaccines (closed circle, closed squares) or PBS (open triangle). The geometric mean of the body temperature of the ferrets per group and geometric standard deviation are shown. c Body weight loss. The body weight at the day of challenge (day 0) and day of euthanasia (day 5) were recorded and the weight loss (in %) plotted on the y-axis. The half-dose, standard dose, and PBS groups were compared in a one-way ANOVA Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, *P < 0.0332, ****P < 0.0001. d Throat swab curves. Quantification of viral RNA by PCR expressed as CDU/mL is depicted for the five different groups (day 0–day 5). The geometric mean of the CDU/mL and geometric standard deviation are shown. e Lung viral load. Lung viral titers recorded as CDU/g lung tissue is plotted on the y-axis. All samples with a value smaller than the value indicated by the dashed gray line fall below the limit of detection.Full size imageThe animals receiving the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 vaccines were protected against morbidity in terms of little to no body weight loss post-challenge with a mean body weight loss of 1% (Q-H7N9) or 3% (D-H7N9). Significantly higher body weight loss was observed in ferrets receiving non-adjuvanted standard-dose vaccines (9% mean body weight loss, both Q- and D-H7N9) or PBS placebo (13% mean body weight loss) (Fig. 5c).To investigate viral replication in the upper respiratory tract, nose and throat swabs were collected daily post-challenge and levels of virus shedding measured by PCR and/or virus titration on MDCK cells. The ferrets immunized with non-adjuvanted standard-dose H7N9 vaccines or injected with PBS placebo showed high levels of viral RNA in the throat after challenge, whereas immunization with the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 vaccines reduced the amount of detectable viral RNA in the throat region by at least 100-fold (Fig. 5d). Samples that had detectable viral RNA were further tested by performing virus titration on MDCK cells (Supplementary Fig. 2) and similar results were obtained. No detectable viral RNA was measured in the nose swabs in any of the groups (Supplementary Fig. 3), except in one animal in both the non-adjuvanted H7N9 standard-dose HA group (Q-H7N9) and in one control (PBS placebo) animal.On day 5 post-challenge, the animals were euthanized, and lung and nasal turbinates were collected to determine viral load. All but two animals (6/8) in the non-adjuvanted standard-dose Q-H7N9 group had replication-competent virus in lung tissues with a geometric mean of 126 TCID50/g lung tissue and all animals (8/8) in the non-adjuvanted standard-dose D-H7N9 group had detectable virus with a GM of 972 TCID50/g (Supplementary Fig 4). Ferrets immunized with AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 vaccines had no detectable replication-competent virus in the lung and only four animals (2 in Q-H7N9 group, 2 in D-H7N9) had detectable levels of viral RNA in the lung (Fig. 5e). The viral load in the animals receiving PBS placebo was about twenty times higher (GMT of 1.41 × 108 CDU/g) than animals receiving the standard-dose vaccines (Fig. 5e). Virus titration of the nasal turbinates further confirmed the protective effect of the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose vaccines (Supplementary Fig 5). None of the ferrets in the groups that received the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose vaccines had detectable virus in the nasal turbinates.These data taken together demonstrate that immunization with AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 split virion vaccines confer H7 cross-reactive antibody responses and protective immunity against wild-type H7N9 virus infection in the ferret model.Histopathological analysis of respiratory tract tissues post-virus challengeThe effect of live virus challenge on the immunized animals was investigated in more detail by performing gross and histopathological evaluation on the trachea and lungs. There was no evidence from the post-mortem examination that the H7N9 influenza virus challenge was confounded by any other infecting microorganisms or underlying disease that was present at the start of the study or acquired during the course of the study.The intratracheal challenge of ferrets with H7N9 influenza virus led to rhinitis across the treatment groups, although approximately one-third of the animals in the study had no rhinitis at all. On average, animals from one of the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose vaccine groups (D-H7N9) and animals from the PBS placebo group were most severely affected (Table 1). Therefore, the severity of the rhinitis did not correlate well with treatment assignment, and the immunological significance of upper respiratory tract histopathology such as that seen in the nasal turbinates is not well understood in context of the vaccine modality described in this study using a stringent model of lower respiratory tract infection following intratracheal challenge.Table 1 Macroscopic and microscopic lung examination at scheduled euthanasia five days post-H7N9 virus challengea.Full size tableThe intratracheal challenge of ferrets with H7N9 influenza virus resulted in alveolitis/alveolar damage, alveolar edema, and hemorrhage that ranged from mild to severe. The animals that received the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose vaccines were least affected in this location (Table 1). Conversely, the animals that received the non-adjuvanted standard-dose vaccines and the PBS placebo animals all had severe histopathological scores in the alveoli (Table 1). For other parameters assessed such as percent affected lung tissue based on gross visual inspection and relative lung weights, as well as additional histopathological parameters such as bronchitis/bronchiolitis and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, a very similar pattern was observed in that the severity index correlated well with treatment assignments and the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 vaccines achieved the best outcomes (Table 1).In summary, the histopathological observations in affected pulmonary tissues of ferrets following intratracheal challenge of wild-type H7N9 influenza virus (A/Anhui/1/2013) seen in the current study are consistent with those reported previously in the setup of this preclinical model18. In addition, the animals that received the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose vaccines (Table 1) had the best histopathological outcomes which further demonstrated a beneficial AS03 adjuvant effect.DiscussionAvian influenza A viruses are a major public health threat. Spillover events of animal viruses into the human population have the potential to cause epidemics or, in the worst case, pandemics19. In 2013, an avian influenza H7N9 virus emerged in China that caused five consecutive, annual waves of infections8,20. The virus caused infections in humans that had close contact with infected animals, but it did not gain the ability for sustained human-to-human transmission. Nevertheless, vaccines against the H7N9 virus are urgently needed as countermeasures against possible outbreaks and for pandemic preparedness3. Humans have no pre-existing, humoral immunity to H7 subtype viruses and it has become clear in earlier studies that an effective adjuvant and/or two-dose vaccination are necessary to achieve protective antibody levels21,22,23.In the present study, AS03-adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted H7N9 inactivated split virion vaccines administered twice (second injection administered 3 weeks after first injection) were evaluated in the naive ferret model and the protective efficacy tested in a non-lethal challenge study. The present study demonstrated that a half-dose of H7N9 inactivated split virion vaccines induced a potent humoral immune response in ferrets when formulated with an effective adjuvant such as AS03. A standard dose of non-adjuvanted vaccines was unable to induce a high percentage of HI seroconversion, highlighting the benefit of the adjuvant. These findings are consistent with results reported in preclinical studies testing an AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 split virion vaccine in ferrets. The addition of the AS03 adjuvant allowed for dose-sparing and elicited robust antibody responses15,17.Furthermore, two administrations of AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 vaccines induced cross-reactive antibodies that inhibit hemagglutination by Eurasian lineage H7 viruses (H7N7, H7N3) and neutralized the same viruses in vitro. In addition, vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose vaccines elicited HI and neutralizing antibodies that reacted against fifth wave H7N9 viruses as well as a feline H7N2 virus of the North American lineage. These results indicate that an AS03-adjuvanted HA vaccine antigen derived from a first wave virus can induce cross-reactive antibodies reacting to more recent fifth wave viruses as well as to other H7 viruses. This cross-reactivity is likely based on conserved shared epitopes, either on the H7 HA head or HA stalk domain, that are not subjected to immune pressure23,24. During the fifth epidemic wave, H7N9 viruses showed more genetic diversity, but recent structural studies report that fifth wave H7 HAs have similar overall structures as compared to a first wave H7 HA. However, based on several amino acid changes in antigenic site A of LPAI H7 HA and the occurrence of HPAI viruses with changes in HA antigenic sites A, C, and D, new candidate vaccine viruses have been proposed to cover these changes25.A previously established low pathogenic avian influenza A H7N9 virus challenge model in ferrets was adapted and employed to test the protective efficacy of the H7N9 split virion vaccine18. The viral challenge experiment demonstrated that the adjuvanted vaccines can suppress fever, minimize body weight loss, and reduce the viral load in throat swabs and lungs (Fig. 5). A more detailed histopathological examination of various tissues showed that the AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 vaccines provided superior protection against lung tissue injury subsequent to viral challenge further demonstrating the beneficial AS03 adjuvant effect (Table 1). In addition, the AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 vaccines reduced viral titers in the upper respiratory tract (throat and nose) which can lead to reduced viral transmission.Other H7N9 vaccine candidates have been tested in preclinical studies and have shown to be immunogenic and protective in animal models. These vaccines include H7N9 split vaccines using different adjuvants like SWE (an oil-in-water adjuvant)26 and MF5927,28 or non-adjuvanted split vaccines29. Other approaches are based on live attenuated virus vaccines30,31, recombinant H7 HA formulations32, or mRNA33,34. The AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 split virion vaccines described in this report compare favorably or, in some cases, out-perform these other vaccine candidates. Favorable results in preclinical studies led to the initiation of human clinical trials testing these pre-pandemic H7N9 split vaccines in human adults14 and are an important component of pandemic preparedness efforts. The present study provides important data that demonstrates induction of cross-reactive antibody responses upon vaccination, which was not investigated and shown prior. These results inform pandemic preparedness strategies moving forward and could help advance other vaccine candidates into clinical trials and provides promising data to continue clinical development.In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that H7N9 split virion vaccines adjuvanted with AS03 induced broad and potent antibody responses in naive ferrets and protected against homologous viral challenge with low pathogenic H7N9 virus. These preclinical results together with previously reported phase I/II results support the advanced clinical development of the AS03-adjuvanted H7N9 split virion vaccines.MethodsVaccines and AS03 adjuvant systemThe investigational monovalent H7N9 egg-derived, inactivated, detergent-split virion vaccines used in this study were manufactured from A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9)-PR8-IDCDC-RG32A reassortant vaccine virus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) using reverse genetics; the virus contains the HA and NA genes of low pathogenic avian A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) virus plus six genes from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus. The sequence is based on a virus initially isolated from a patient with fatal disease. The vaccine was manufactured at two different GSK production sites, Quebec (Q-H7N9) and Dresden (D-H7N9). The Q-H7N9 vaccine was manufactured at GSK, Sainte-Foy, Québec, Canada, using the FluLaval Quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine process, whereas the D-H7N9 vaccine was manufactured at GSK, Dresden, Germany, using the Fluarix Quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine process slightly modified. The Q-H7N9 vaccine was further developed and tested in a human clinical trial14. Both vaccines were used for the ferret immunizations as final bulk material manufactured under good manufacturing practice (GMP). AS0335 was manufactured under good manufacturing practice (GMP) by GSK. AS03 is an Adjuvant System containing α-tocopherol and squalene in an oil-in-water emulsion (11.86 mg α-tocopherol). The AS03 used for the study described herein is the equivalent of the adult human dose. The detergent-split virion vaccines were ad-mixed with the AS03 by gentle inversion preceding each immunization.The standard-dose non-adjuvanted vaccine formulation consisted of a target dose of 15 µg HA, whereas the half-dose adjuvanted formulations consisted of a target dose of 7.5 µg HA mixed at a 1:1 ratio with AS03 adjuvant containing 47.44 mg/ml α-tocopherol. Standard and half-dose formulations refer to standard or half doses of split virion influenza vaccines typically given to human adults. The HA content for formulation was measured by single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) assay. The antigen dose for the Q-H7N9 vaccines were less than the initially intended concentrations of 15 and 7.5 µg HA because the SRID assay used to measure the antigen concentration overestimated the antigen concentration in relation to later available reagents provided by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). The adjusted vaccine doses for the Q-H7N9 vaccines based on revised SRID values were 10.5 µg HA in the non-adjuvanted standard-dose vaccine and 5.25 µg HA in the half-dose adjuvanted vaccine. Both vaccine formulations contained 0.001% thimerosal. Sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Viroclinics Biosciences B.V.) was given to the placebo group. The vaccine formulations were prepared on the day of administration (day 0 and day 21).Animals and husbandryThe animal study was carried out in the central animal facilities of The Netherlands Vaccine Institute (NVI; Bilthoven, The Netherlands). The NVI is approved for animal work under local legislation; Dutch Animal Experimentation Act, 1977 (Wet op de dierproeven, 1977), which is the Dutch equivalent to the European Council Directive 86/609 EEG. The protocol was licensed under protocol number 201300081 by the animal ethics committee. The study was conducted in accordance with the GSK Policy on the Care, Welfare, and Treatment of Laboratory Animals and it was reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the NVI.The ferrets were serologically tested for Aleutian disease using counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) and were confirmed seronegative for circulating H1N1 and H3N2 virus as well as H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013) virus in hemagglutination inhibition assays. Only animals that were found seronegative for Aleutian disease and influenza viruses were used for the current study. The animals were housed in normal cages in groups of eight animals during the acclimation phase and immunization phase, and they were transferred to glovebox isolator cages on the day of the challenge. The animals had free access to food and water. For all experimental manipulations, the ferrets were anesthetized by intramuscular injection with ketamine or a mixture of ketamine and medetomidine.Ferret vaccination and intratracheal challengeEight female ferrets were used per vaccine or PBS placebo group. Animals were immunized on days 0 and 21 with non-adjuvanted standard-dose H7N9 split virion Q-H7N9 or D-H7N9 vaccine, AS03-adjuvanted half-dose H7N9 split virion Q-H7N9 or D-H7N9, or PBS placebo. On days 0, 21, and 49, 2.5 mL of blood was collected from the jugular vein in clot tubes from anesthetized animals. The tubes were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, serum was collected, and stored at −80 °C until used for serology. The immunization scheme and overview of the study groups can be seen in Fig. 1a, b. Body weight was monitored on days 0, 21, 49, and 54. On day 49, the animals were challenged intratracheally with 105.5 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) wild-type H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013) virus under biosafety level 3 containment as previously established18. Throat and nose swabs were taken on days 49 through 54, inclusive. Body temperatures were monitored continuously with a 10 min interval by means of an implanted recorder (Star-Oddi, Gardabaer, Iceland). The recorder was implanted into the peritoneal cavity 36 days prior the first immunization. The animals were euthanized on day 54 and lung tissue and nasal turbinates collected for viral load determination and histopathology.Cells, proteins, and virusesMadin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and human embryonic kidney (293T) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic mix (100 U/mL of penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin; Gibco) and fetal bovine serum (FBS, 10%; HyClone). BTI-TN5B1-4 (Trichoplusia ni) cells were grown in serum-free SFX medium (HyClone), containing antibiotics (100 U/mL of penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin; Gibco).The recombinant proteins, including H7 from A/Anhui/1/2013, H7 from A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016, H7 from A/Hunan/02285/2017, H7 from A/Hong Kong/2014/2017, and H7 from A/feline/New York/16-040082/2016 were produced in the baculovirus expression vector system as previously described36,37. The polybasic cleavage site of the highly pathogenic avian isolate A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 was removed, resulting in a low pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 cleavage site and increased protein stability.The H7 low pathogenic virus variants were rescued in a A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) background by reverse genetics techniques as previously described38. Briefly, the H7 HA segment of A/Hong Kong/2014/2017 and A/Hunan/02285/2017 were combined, respectively, with the seven other genomic influenza A segments of PR8, resulting in 7:1 reassortants. The H7 HA and N2 NA segment of A/feline/New York/16-040082/2016 were combined with the six internal segments of PR8, resulting in 6:2 virus variants. The HA and NA cDNA was synthetically produced (Thermo Fisher), and all virus reassortants were sequenced to confirm the genotype. The viruses were grown in 8–10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories) at 37 °C for 48 h and the allantoic fluid was harvested.The wild-type influenza H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013 virus isolate used for the challenge phase was passaged three times in embryonated chicken eggs and once in MDCK cells. The virus is based on an isolate from a fatal human case in China and was kindly provided by the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework18.Viruses and proteins used in serological assays in this study are indicated in the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1c.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Microtiter plates (96-well, Thermo Fisher) were coated with recombinant H7 HA proteins at a concentration of 2 µg/mL diluted in coating buffer (SeraCare) at 4 °C overnight. The following day, the plates were washed three times with PBS (Gibco) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked with 220 µL of blocking solution (PBS-T supplemented with 3% goat serum (Life Technologies) and 0.5% milk powder (American Bio) for 1 h at room temperature. Ferret serum samples were diluted to an initial starting concentration of 1:100, serially diluted 1:2 in blocking solution, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with PBS-T and 50 µL anti-ferret IgG (goat anti-ferret IgG (gamma chain-specific) horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate, Alpha Diagnostics, #70530) per well was added. The 96-well plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed four times with PBS-T, and developed with 100 µL/well of SigmaFast o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD; Sigma). To stop the reaction, 50 µL/well 3 M hydrochloric acid (Thermo Fisher) was added and the plates were read at 490 nm with a microtiter plate reader (BioTek). The data were analyzed in Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism Version 8. The cutoff value was defined as the average of all blank wells plus three times the standard deviation of the blanks. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated based on the cutoff value.Hemagglutination inhibitionHemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers against H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013, H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013, H7N7 A/Netherlands/219/2003, and H7N3 A/mallard/Netherlands/12/2000 were determined at Viroclinics as described previoulsy39. In brief, after treatment with cholera filtrate (receptor destroying enzyme, RDE) and heat-inactivation at 56 °C, the sera were tested for the presence of anti-HA antibodies. For this purpose, 1% turkey erythrocytes were used and four HA-units of the different H7 influenza strains. Titers of 1:5 were assigned to HI-negative samples to facilitate data analysis and data representation.Serum antibody titers against the fifth wave viruses (A/Hunan/02285/2017, A/Hong Kong/2014/2017) and H7N2 (A/feline/New York/16-040082/2016) were measured in a slightly modified HI assay at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The ferret sera were treated with RDE (Denka Seiken) to remove nonspecific inhibition of hemagglutination. In brief, for 25 µL sera 75 µL RDE was added and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 75 µL sodium citrate (2.5%) and incubation at 56 °C for 1 h. The sera were diluted with 75 µL PBS, resulting in an overall dilution of 1:10 (limit of detection of the assay). The pre-diluted sera were serially diluted 1:2 in v-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher). The viruses (A/Hunan/02285/2017, A/feline/New York/16-040082/2016, A/Hong Kong/2014/2017) were diluted to 8 hemagglutination units (HAU)/50 µL in PBS and 25 µL/well of virus was added to the serially diluted sera in the v-bottom plates (Sigma). The plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature on a shaker. Chicken red blood cells (RBCs, Lampire Biologicals) were diluted to a concentration of 0.5% in PBS and 50 µL/well were added to the sera/virus mixture. The plates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, the results recorded in Microsoft Excel and analyzed in GraphPad Prism Version 8. The HI titer was defined as the last dilution in which hemagglutination does not occur. Negative samples (hemagglutination at all dilutions) were assigned a value of 5 (half of the limit of detection) for GMT calculation and data representation.MicroneutralizationVirus neutralization (VN) titers against H7N9 (A/Shanghai/2/2013 and A/Anhui/1/2013), H7N7, and H7N3 were measured at Viroclinics as described previously39. In brief, sera were tested after heat-inactivation at 56 °C for 30 min for the presence of VN antibodies using a microneutralization assay with ~100× TCID50 of the different H7 influenza strains. Neutralization titers were calculated as the dilution giving 50% neutralization and expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution. Samples below the limit of detection were assigned a value of 8 for GMT calculations and data representation.The more recently circulating H7 viruses were tested in a modified microneutralization assay at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. MDCK cells (100 µL/well) were seeded at a concentration of 1.6 × 105 cells/mL complete DMEM in 96-well tissue culture plates (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Ferret sera were RDE-treated as described above, resulting in an initial dilution of 1:10 (limit of detection). The pre-diluted sera were serially diluted 1:2 in UltraMDCK media (Lonza), containing tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (infection media; Sigma) at a concentration of 1 μg/mL, in 96-well culture plates. The viruses were diluted to a concentration of 100-TCID50, added to the serially diluted sera, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature on a shaker. The MDCK cells were washed with 220 µL PBS/well and 100 µL/well of the virus/sera mixture was added to the cells. The plates were incubated for 72 h at 33 °C. Chicken RBCs were diluted to a concentration of 0.5% in PBS and 50 µL of cell supernatant was transferred to v-bottom plates (Sigma). RBCs (50 µL/well) were added to the v-bottom plates and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The neutralization titer was defined as the last dilution in which hemagglutination does not occur. Negative samples were assigned a value of 5 (half of the limit of detection) for GMT calculation and data representation. The results were recorded in Microsoft Excel and analyzed in GraphPad Prism Version 8.Virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract and viral load in tissuesLevels of viral RNA (from infectious and non-infectious virus) were determined by means of influenza virus A matrix gene-specific TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and levels of infectious (replication-competent) virus were determined by virus titration on MDCK cells. Virus RNA load and infectious virus titer in the upper respiratory tract (URT) were expressed as Control Dilution Units (CDU)/mL and TCID50/mL, respectively. CDU were determined from a standard curve produced from a stock virus with a known titer which was serially diluted in a 10-fold dilution series, with each dilution undergoing nucleic acid extraction and Taqman PCR amplification in the same manner as test samples. The undiluted virus (virus stock) had a titer of 8.5 log10 TCID50/mL, was diluted from 100 to 10−8 (in 10-fold dilution steps) and tested in triplicate in the PCR resulting in a slope of the standard curve of 3.49 and intercept of 40.84. On the basis of the standard curve, the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of PCR was determined to be 0.8 log10 CDU/mL. Samples below the LLOQ are shown as <0.8 log10 CDU/mL. All samples that gave a Ct value were analyzed by virus titration. Virus titration was performed on a newly thawed aliquot as described elsewhere40. The LLOQ of virus titration was 0.8 log10 TCID50/mL. Samples below this cutoff value were scored as <0.8 log10 TCID50/mL. Virus RNA load and infectious virus titer in tissues were expressed as log10 CDU/gram of tissue and log10 TCID50/g of tissue, respectively. All tissue samples were analyzed by TaqMan PCR and virus titration. The LLOQ of each lung and turbinate sample varied according to the individual tissue weight.Gross and histopathological evaluationAt the time of scheduled euthanasia on day 54, a complete macroscopic gross-pathological assessment of all organ systems was performed, and all abnormalities were noted. All trachea and lung lobes were visually inspected and weighed, and any abnormal lesions were noted and described. The nasal turbinates and left lung with trachea of each animal were collected and these tissues were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin for histopathological examination. Following fixation, tissue sections were embedded in paraffin blocks for processing, micro-sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological examination by light microscopy. The following histopathological abnormalities were noted when present in the nasal turbinates or the lungs: severity of inflammatory cell infiltration, congestion, damage, edema, hemorrhage, hyperplasia/inflammation. All personnel performing the analyses in which interpretation of data was required were unaware of the study treatment assignments, and specimens were masked by allocating a unique sample number to each sample collected.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
