CDC analyzes data on influenza viruses and associated morbidity and mortality each influenza (flu) season. This data helps identify the vaccine viruses to be included in the new annual Northern Hemisphere flu vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee reviewed and evaluated the data on the 2022–2023 flu season and the performance of the 2022-2023 flu vaccines to determine the composition of the 2023–2024 U.S. flu vaccines. Executive summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza viruses and associated morbidity and mortality in the United States. Influenza activity in the United States during the 2022–2023 season (October 2, 2022–September 9, 2023) was moderately severe and was characterized by activity that returned to pre-COVID-19 levels but occurred earlier than is usual. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses were the predominant virus subtype circulating during the single wave of activity that peaked in late November and early December; however, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B/Victoria viruses also were reported. This report describes the extent and timing of influenza activity in the United States during the 2022–2023 influenza season (October 2, 2022–September 9, 2023) as reported to CDC by clinical and public health laboratories, outpatient providers, emergency departments, hospitals, vital statistics offices, and public health departments. It also includes the composition of the Northern Hemisphere 2023–2024 influenza vaccines and a brief update on influenza activity occurring during the summer of 2023 in the Southern Hemisphere. Virologic surveillance U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating laboratories and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratories, which include both clinical and public health laboratories throughout the United States, contribute to virologic surveillance for influenza1. During the 2022–2023 influenza season, the included clinical laboratories tested 4,023,390 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses using clinical diagnostic tests. Among these, 358,781 (8.9%) specimens tested positive, including 349,050 (97.3%) for influenza A and 9,731 (2.7%) for influenza B viruses. The percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza each week ranged from 0.7% to 26.3% and peaked during the week ending December 10, 2022 (week 49) (Figure 1). Public health laboratories tested 283,440 specimens and reported 30,993 positive specimens, with 29,552 (95.4%) positive for influenza A and 1,441 (4.6%) positive for influenza B viruses. Among 25,160 seasonal influenza A viruses that were subtyped, 7,465 (29.7%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 17,695 (70.3%) were influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Influenza B lineage information was available for 1,168 (81.1%) influenza B viruses, with all of them belonging to the Victoria lineage. No influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses were identified. The 2022–2023 influenza season was characterized by an early increase in seasonal influenza activity, with activity increasing nationally early in October 2022 and peaking in early December 2022 (Figure 1). Based on the percentage of specimens testing positive in clinical laboratories, all 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions experienced a single wave of influenza activity that peaked between early November and mid-December: HHS Region 4 (Southeast) peaked in early November; Regions 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10 (New England, New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico, Mid-Atlantic, West Coast, and Pacific Northwest) peaked in late November; Regions 6 and 7 (South Central and Central) peaked in early December; and regions 5 and 8 (Midwest and Mountain) peaked in mid-December 2022. Figure 1. Influenza Positive Test Results Reported by Clinical Laboratories to CDC, National Summary by MMWR week and Influenza Season — United States, 2017–18 to 2022–23 Seasons Influenza Positive Test Results Reported by Clinical Laboratories to CDC, National Summary by MMWR week and Influenza Season—United States, 2017–18 to 2022–2023 Seasons Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant virus during the 2022–2023 influenza season as a whole and for each week from early October through the end of January. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B/Victoria viruses circulated at lower levels during the season; however, during the weeks of low virus circulation since February, A(H1N1)pdm09 or B viruses were identified more frequently than A(H3N2) viruses. Since mid-June, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been the predominant virus (Figure 2). Among the influenza A viruses that were subtyped, influenza A(H3N2) viruses were the most common virus among all age groups; comprising 70.8% of influenza A(H3N2) viruses identified in persons aged 0–4 years, 74.5% in 5–24 years, 61.1% in 25–64 years, and 67.9% in those aged 65 years or older. While A(H3N2) viruses were more common among all age groups, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses accounted for more than one third (38.9%) of the influenza A detections in persons 25 to 64 years old. Figure 2. Influenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC by U.S. Public Health Laboratories, National Summary, October 2, 2022 – September 9, 2023 Influenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC by U.S. Public Health Laboratories, National Summary, October 2, 2022–September 9, 2023 Virus characterization & antiviral susceptibility Genetic characterization of the viruses circulating during this time period was conducted using next generation sequencing, and the genomic data were analyzed and submitted to publicly accessible databases (GenBank and EpiFlu). Phylogenies of representative subsets of genetic data from CDC and other submitters can be visualized in real time at Next Strains. To evaluate whether genetic changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) of circulating viruses affected antigenicity, antigenic characterizations were conducted using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays (A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses) or neutralization-based HINT (A(H3N2) viruses) and post-infection ferret antisera raised to reference viruses representing the 2022–2023 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses. Both assays determine how well antibodies raised to the vaccine reference viruses recognize or bind to circulating viruses. HINT measures how well antibodies neutralize or block virus infection of a cell whereas the HI assay measures how well antibodies inhibit the binding between the HA of the virus and the sialic acid receptors on the surface of red blood cells. CDC genetically characterized 3,370 viruses (2,923 influenza A and 432 influenza B) collected in the United States during October 2, 2022–September 9, 2023, and antigenically characterized viruses representing various genetic clades. Overall, the vaccine antigens for each of the three major groups of the influenza viruses circulating in people (i.e., A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B/Victoria) elicited antibodies that reacted well with most of the co-circulating viruses during this period. Detailed characterization data for each group are below. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Phylogenetic analysis of the HA demonstrated that all viruses tested belonged to the 6B.1A.5a lineage and were classified in 3 clades. Clade 5a.1 represented less than 1% (n=6), 19% (n=244) were clade 5a.2a, and 80% (n=1,025) were 5a.2a.1. Nearly all (99%, n=432) of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized were well recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer by HI) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/588/2019-like reference viruses which represent the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. Nearly all (99%, n=410) of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized were well recognized by ferret antisera to egg-grown A/Victoria/2570/2019-like reference viruses which represent the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for egg-based influenza vaccines. Influenza A(H3N2) All 1,663 genetically characterized A(H3N2) viruses belonged to one of the subclades of the 3C.2a1b.2a.2 clade, with the majority (70%, n=1,162) belonging to the 2b subclade. Antigenic analysis showed that 346 (93%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer by HI or HINT) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses that represent the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. Fewer A(H3N2) viruses (66%, n=176) were well recognized by ferret antisera raised to the egg-grown A/Darwin/9/2021-like reference viruses that represent the A(H3N2) component for egg-based influenza vaccines. Influenza B All influenza B viruses for which characterization was possible belonged to the B/Victoria-lineage. Infections with B/Yamagata viruses have not been identified globally since March of 2020. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes showed that 99% (n=426) belonged to clade V1A.3a.2 and 1% (n=6) were clade V1A.3. Antigenic analysis showed that 98% (n=154) were well recognized by both ferret antisera to cell-grown and egg-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses that represent the B/Victoria-lineage component for the cell- and recombinant-based and egg-based influenza vaccines. CDC also assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral medications. Between October 2, 2022 and September 9, 2023, a total of 3,344 viruses collected in the United States were genetically characterized for susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors, and a subset of 369 (11%) were tested phenotypically. All genetically characterized viruses lacked known mutations associated with resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors, except one A(H1N1)pdm09 virus that had an NA-S247G amino acid substitution and one A(H1N1)pdm09 virus that had a mix of amino acids (H and Y) at position 275 of the NA. All viruses tested phenotypically showed normal inhibition by neuraminidase inhibitors, except the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus with NA-S247G that displayed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus with mix NA-H275H/Y that displayed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. A total of 3,213 viruses were genetically characterized for susceptibility to the polymerase acidic (PA) cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir, and a subset of 372 (11.6%) were tested phenotypically. One A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had a PA-E199G amino acid substitution, which conferred reduced baloxavir susceptibility, and all remaining tested viruses were susceptible to baloxavir. Table 1.

The A(H3N2), B/Victoria lineage and B/Yamagata lineage components are unchanged from the 2022–2023 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. Both the egg-based and cell- or recombinant-based vaccines had a change in the A(H1N1)pdm09 component. In the egg-based vaccine it was changed to an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus and in cell- or recombinant-based vaccines it was changed to an A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus23. The genetic clade and subclade for the recommended vaccine viruses were 5a.2a.1 for A(H1N1)pdm09, 3C.2a1b.2a.2 for A(H3N2), V1A.3a.2 for B/Victoria, and Y3 for B/Yamagata. Table 2.

From October 2, 2022, through September 9, 2023, three novel influenza A viruses were detected in persons and reported to CDC (Figure 3). All three were variant viruses (i.e., a swine influenza virus identified in a human and designated with a "v"). One influenza A(H3N2)v virus was identified in New Mexico in October 2022; two variant viruses were identified in Michigan in July 2023 (one A(H1N2)v virus and one A(H3)v virus). All three viruses were detected in children younger than 18 years, and all three patients had swine exposure prior to illness onset. No person-to-person transmission of variant influenza A viruses associated with these patients was identified. CDC continues to monitor highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses in wild birds and poultry in the United States. An updated technical report summarizing the current state of HPAI A(H5N1) virus, published on July 7, 2023, detailed virus activity and actions CDC and the U.S. Government are taking in response to the virus.4 Despite continued identification of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses in birds and mammals, no avian influenza viruses were detected in humans in the United States during the 2022–2023 season. Figure 3. Novel Influenza A Virus Cases by Season— United States, 2010-11 to 2022-23 Seasons U.S. novel influenza A virus cases 2010–2011 to 2022–2023 Outpatient respiratory illness surveillance Information on outpatient visits to health care providers for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness ([ILI], fever plus cough or sore throat) is collected through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet).1 Nationally, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for ILI recorded in ILINet was at or above the national baseline of 2.5% for 21 consecutive weeks from October 2022 to March 2023 and peaked at 7.5% during the week ending November 26, 2022 (week 47) (Figure 4). This was the earliest peak activity associated with seasonal influenza recorded in ILINet since the system began in 1997. ILI activity peaked in all 10 HHS Regions during the week ending November 26, 2022 (week 47), but the number of weeks of elevated activity (weeks above the region-specific baseline) varied. Region 9 (West Coast) had ILI activity above baseline for 34 weeks while the remaining 9 HHS Regions were above baseline for 21 weeks or less. Multiple respiratory viruses cocirculated during the 2022–2023 season and the contribution of influenza viruses to ILI likely varied by week and location. ILI activity during the 2022–2023 season returned to levels that were more similar to those seen before the COVID-19 pandemic which may be attributed to respiratory virus circulation and healthcare seeking behavior that was more similar to pre-COVID seasons than what occurred during the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 seasons. Figure 4. Percentage of Outpatient Visits for Respiratory Illness as Reported by ILINet, National Summary by Season — United States, 2017–2018 to 2022–2023 Seasons *Effective October 3, 2021 (week 40), the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes “without a known cause other than influenza." About 70% of ILINet providers report total number of patient visits, as well as ILI visits, by age group, allowing the calculation of percentage of visits for ILI by age group. Both pediatric age groups (0–4 years and 5–24 years) had a higher percentage of visits for ILI compared to the adult age groups throughout the season. Peak activity among the pediatric population occurred during the week ending November 26, 2022 (week 47) (17.4% among 0–4 years and 12.7% among 5–24 years). ILI activity among adults peaked during the week ending December 3, 2022 (week 48) and ranged from 6.1% among those 25–49 years to 3.0% among those ≥65 years. Figure 5. Percentage of Outpatient Visits by Age Group for Respiratory Illness as Reported by ILINet—United States, October 2, 2022–September 9, 2023 U.S. percentage of outpatient visits by age group October 2, 2022–September 9, 2023 ILINet data are used to produce weekly jurisdiction and core-based statistical area (CBSA)-level measures of ILI activity. From the 2008–2009 season through the 2018–2019 season ILI activity categories ranged from minimal to high; during the 2019–2020 season the very high category was added1. For the weeks ending November 26, 2022–December 31, 2022 (weeks 47–52), more than 70% of the 56 jurisdictions experienced high or very high ILI activity each week, with the highest number (46; 82.1%) occurring during the week ending November 26, 2022 (week 47). During the previous two influenza seasons (2021–2022 and 2020–2021), the peak number of jurisdictions experiencing high or very high ILI activity during a single week was 3 (5.5%); however, among the three seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic, the peak number of jurisdictions experiencing high or very high activity during a single week ranged from 33 (60.0%) during the 2018–2019 season to 47 (85.5%) during the 2019–2020 season. Long-term care facility (LTCF) surveillance LTCFs (e.g., nursing homes/skilled nursing, long-term care for the developmentally disabled, and assisted living facilities) from all 50 states and U.S. territories report data on influenza virus infections among residents through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Long-term Care Facility Component1. During the 2022–2023 season, the weekly percentage of facilities reporting at least one influenza-positive test result among residents ranged from 0.2% to 6.9% nationally and peaked during the week ending December 10, 2023 (week 49). HHS Regions 2–10 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, South Central, Central, Mountain, West Coast, and Pacific Northwest) experienced peak activity during the week ending December 10, 2023 (week 49), while Region 1 (New England) peaked during the week ending December 31, 2023 (week 52). This season's activity was higher and peaked earlier compared to the 2021–2022 season when activity peaked at 1.4% during early January (Figure 6). Figure 6. Percent of Long-Term Care Facilities with at Least One Influenza Positive Test Among Residents, Reported to the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) — United States, 2021–2022 to 2022–2023* Seasons *Data collection for the 2022–2023 influenza season ended the week ending June 10, 2023 (week 23). Hospitalization surveillance CDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections through two surveillance systems: the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), which covers approximately 9% of the U.S. population, and NHSN Hospitalization Surveillance (previously referred to as HHS Protect Hospitalization Surveillance), which consists of reports from all hospitals across the country1. During October 1, 2022–April 30, 2023, the last day of FluSurv-NET active monitoring during the 2022–2023 season, a total of 18,269 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites. Hospitalization rates peaked nationally during the week ending December 3, 2022 (week 48), at 8.7 per 100,000 population. This is the third highest weekly rate observed during all seasons going back to 2010–2011; this follows the 2017–2018 season, which peaked at 10.2 per 100,000 during the week ending January 6, 2018 (week 1) and the 2014–2015 season which peaked at 9.0 per 100,000 during the week ending December 27, 2014 (week 52). Figure 7. Weekly Rate of Laboratory Confirmed Influenza Hospitalizations—United States, 2014–2015 to 2022–2023** Laboratory confirmed influenza hospitalizations 2014–2015 to 2022–2023 The overall cumulative hospitalization rate for the 2022–2023 was 62.4 per 100,000 population. The 2022–2023 season’s cumulative hospitalization rate was similar to hospitalization rates for 4 prior seasons (the 2014–2015, 2016–2017, 2018–2019, and 2019–2020 seasons) and was higher than hospitalization rates for all other seasons since 2010, except the 2017–2018 season. Figure 8. Cumulative Rate of Laboratory Confirmed Hospitalizations — United States, 2014–2015 to 2022–2023** U.S. cumulative rate of laboratory confirmed hospitalizations 2014–2015 to 2022–2023 When examining rates by age, the highest rate of hospitalization per 100,000 population was among adults aged ≥65 years (187.3), followed by children aged 0–4 years (80.6), adults aged 50–64 years (67.9), children and adolescents aged 5–17 years (29.5), and was lowest among adults aged 18–49 years (27.2). Most (95.6%) influenza-related hospitalizations were associated with influenza A viruses, and 75.1% of those subtyped were A(H3N2)] viruses. When examining rates by race and ethnicity, the highest rate of hospitalization per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons (89.3), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (85.6), Hispanic/Latino persons (57.7), non-Hispanic White persons (55.8), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander persons (28.6). Among 5,390 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 96.8% had at least one reported underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and obesity. Among 1,572 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15–49 years) with information on pregnancy status, 36.0% were pregnant. Among hospitalized children and adolescents with information about underlying conditions, 66.1% reported at least one underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported were asthma, neurologic disease, and obesity. Between October 2, 2022, and September 9, 2023, 226,517 influenza associated hospitalizations were reported to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance Component (previously referred to as HHS Protect Hospitalization Surveillance), with a cumulative rate of 66.0 per 100,000 population for the season. Hospitalizations began to increase in early October, peaking nationally during the week ending December 3, 2022 (week 48) at 26,221 hospitalizations (7.6 per 100,000 population) and declined to interseasonal levels by the end of January 2023. Trends of influenza hospitalizations at the regional level were similar to the national trend with activity in HHS Regions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 (Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, South Central, Central and West Coast) peaking during early December 2022, Regions 1, 2, and 10 (New England, New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico, and Pacific Northwest) peaking in mid-December, and Region 8 (Mountain) peaking in late December. The regions with the highest cumulative hospitalization rates for the season were Region 6 (South Central) at 87.7 per 100,000 population, Region 7 (Central) at 79.9 per 100,000 population, and Region 10 (Pacific Northwest) at 77.3 per 100,000 population. The region with the lowest cumulative hospitalization rate was Region 8 (Mountain), at 44.6 per 100,000 population. This season's peak was earlier and higher than what was reported during the 2021–2022 season. Figure 9. Number of New Influenza Hospital Admissions Reported to the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hospitalization Surveillance Component (previously referred to as HHS Protect Hospitalization Surveillance), National Summary, 2021–2022 to 2022–2023 Seasons Number of new influenza hospital admissions reported 2021–2022 to 2022–2023 seasons Mortality surveillance According to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Surveillance System1 as of September 14, 2023, during October 2, 2022–September 9, 2023, the weekly percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) peaked at 12.7% during the week ending January 7, 2023 (week 1). Of note, the percentage of deaths due to PIC was below the epidemic threshold for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic during the week ending June 17, 2023 (week 24) and dropped below the epidemic threshold again during the weeks ending July 1, 2023, and July 22, 2023 (weeks 26 and 29) (Figure 10). Of the 241,969 PIC deaths reported between October 2, 2022–September 9, 2023, 82,786 (34.2%) had COVID-19 listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death, and 9,697 (4.0%) listed influenza, indicating that PIC–associated mortality during the 2022–2023 season was still due primarily to COVID-19 and not influenza1. The highest weekly count of deaths due to influenza was 1,048 (1.6% of all deaths), occurring the week ending December 17, 2022 (week 50) (Figure 11). Figure 10.

Influenza Mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, 2018–2019 to 2022–2023 Seasons Influenza mortality 2018–2019 to 2022–2023 seasons CDC monitors influenza-associated deaths in children younger than 18 years of age through the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System1. During October 2, 2022–September 9, 2023, a total of 174 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to CDC (Figure 9); this is the third largest number of pediatric deaths reported during a seasonal influenza epidemic (2019–2020 [199 deaths], 2017–2018 [188 deaths]) since reporting began during the 2004–2005 season. This season, 163 of the reported deaths were associated with influenza A viruses and 11 were associated with influenza B viruses. Of 88 influenza A viruses with a reported subtype, 68 (77%) were influenza A (H3N2), 19 (22%) were influenza A (H1N1), and one (1%) was a coinfection with influenza A (H1N1) and influenza A (H3N2). All three influenza B deaths with a reported lineage were caused by influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses. No pediatric deaths associated with influenza B/Yamagata have been reported since the 2017–2018 season. The mean age at death was 7 years (range = 3 weeks–17 years). Of 172 children and adolescents with known location of death, 80 (47%) died after hospital admission; 59 (34%) died in an emergency room; and 33 (19%) died outside a hospital setting. Among the 164 children and adolescents with a known medical history, 73 (45%) had at least one underlying medical condition associated with higher risk for developing serious influenza-related complications. Among the 131 children and adolescents who were eligible for influenza vaccination (age ≥6 months at date of illness onset) and for whom vaccination status was known, 109 (83%) were not fully vaccinated.

However, CDC uses a mathematical model to estimate the number of influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths that occur each season5. Preliminary in-season estimates of influenza burden in the United States for the 2022–2023 season are that influenza virus infection resulted in 31 million symptomatic illnesses, 14 million medical visits, 360,000 hospitalizations, and 21,000 deaths. Preliminary end of season burden estimates for the 2022–2023 season will be available in October 2023. Influenza activity in the southern hemisphere Influenza activity in the Southern Hemisphere typically occurs between April and September and can last into October or November. In the Northern Hemisphere, the influenza season can begin as early as October and can last as late as April or May. According to data collected and submitted by countries to the World Health Organization's FluNet system6, influenza activity in the Southern Hemisphere is ongoing as of August 2023, with influenza A viruses being reported most often and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 being the predominant subtype. Some South American countries experienced early or high levels of influenza activity compared to their historic trends. For example, activity in Chile began earlier than historic trends, while activity in Paraguay ended earlier than usual, and activity in Bolivia was both higher and earlier compared to historic data. South Africa, one of the few Southern Hemisphere countries with predominantly influenza A(H3N2) virus activity, experienced a high percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza but a moderate level of influenza-related hospitalizations compared to historic trends7. Activity in South Africa declined earlier than what has been seen historically. Similar to South Africa, influenza activity in Australia decreased earlier during the 2023 season as compared to historic trends. Of note, Mexico, located in the Northern Hemisphere, traditionally experiences peak influenza circulation during the October–March season but had atypically high influenza activity during the Southern Hemisphere season and saw primarily influenza B/Victoria virus circulation. In the tropical countries of Bangladesh and Thailand, the 2023 influenza season began later than previous seasons and activity is still above epidemic thresholds. Discussion The 2022–2023 influenza season in the United States is considered moderately severe with an estimate of at least 31 million symptomatic illnesses, 14 million medical visits, 360,000 hospitalizations, and 21,000 deaths caused by influenza virus infection. The predominant influenza virus throughout the 2022–2023 influenza season was influenza A(H3N2); however, as activity declined, A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Victoria viruses began circulating at higher proportions than A(H3N2) viruses. Most influenza viruses tested were in the same genetic subclade as, and antigenically similar to, the vaccine reference viruses included in the season's influenza vaccine. All the influenza viruses collected and tested for antiviral resistance by CDC since October 2, 2022, were susceptible to zanamivir, and peramivir and the majority (>99%) were susceptible to oseltamivir and baloxivir. This season marked a return to influenza activity at levels more similar to those seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The peak percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza (26.3%) as reported to CDC from clinical laboratories nationally was similar to the average peak percentage positive (26.5%) during the five influenza seasons (2015–2016 through 2019–2020) immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, the cumulative rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations as reported in FluSurv-NET this season was similar to hospitalization rates for 4 pre-COVID seasons (2014–2015, 2016–2017, 2018–2019, and 2019–2020 seasons) and higher than all but one remaining season (2017–18 season) since the 2010–11 season. Mortality attributed to influenza also returned to levels more similar to what was seen before the COVID-19 pandemic. As of September 14, 2023, the number of death certificates with influenza listed as an underlying or contributing cause of death during the 2022–2023 season (9,697) was above the average number of influenza coded deaths (8,530) during the five seasons preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (2015–2016 through 2019–2020) and 3 to 10 times higher than the number of influenza coded deaths during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of pediatric deaths reported this season (174) was above the average reported number of deaths each season (147) for the five seasons preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. Although influenza activity in the United States returned to levels similar to pre-COVID-19 influenza seasons, timing of activity occurred earlier than usual. During the 2022–2023 season, activity peaked nationally between late November and early December (depending on the indicator) which is at least three weeks before the earliest recorded seasonal peak going back to the 1997–1998 season and two months before the most common month for peak influenza activity (February). Influenza activity returned to interseasonal levels in February 2023, and no significant second wave of activity was reported. While not always a predictor of the subsequent Northern Hemisphere influenza season, Southern Hemisphere activity in the summer is often considered when planning for what could be expected. However, due to continued varied influenza activity among Southern Hemisphere countries, different influenza viruses predominating in different parts of the world, and the possibility of variations in population immunity between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, Southern Hemisphere activity cannot be used to definitively predict the timing or intensity of influenza activity in the United States this fall and winter. Though influenza activity has remained low in the summer, maintaining vigilance for influenza virus infections in the United States year-round is important. Sporadic seasonal influenza virus infections and novel influenza A infections associated with exposure to swine during animal exhibitions often are reported during the summer months8. While the number of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus among birds has been low in this summer it is important that providers and persons with exposure to sick or infected birds remain attentive to any new symptoms that could be consistent with influenza virus infection4. Patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should isolate at home away from household members and not go to work or school until they are proven not to be infected or have recovered from their illness. Specimens from patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should be collected and referred to state public health departments for testing and treatment with influenza antiviral medications should be initiated immediately. While we do not know exactly what the coming influenza season will look like, influenza results in a significant public health burden in the United States every winter. For persons aged ≥6 months, receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences. There are also everyday preventive actions, including avoiding close contact with people who are sick, limiting contact with others if you are sick, and covering your coughs and sneezes, that can help reduce the spread of influenza. Influenza antiviral drugs are another way to minimize the impact of influenza this coming season. CDC recommends initiating influenza antiviral drug treatment as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at increased risk for influenza-associated complications9. Four influenza antiviral drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration are currently recommended for use in the United States. Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly. Additional information regarding influenza viruses, surveillance, vaccines, antiviral medications, and novel influenza A infections in humans is available online.

Understanding host proteins essential for IAV infection can identify targets for alternative host-directed therapies (HDTs). Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry and global phosphoproteomic and protein abundance analyses using three IAV strains (pH1N1, H3N2, H5N1) in three human cell types (A549, NHBE, THP-1), we map 332 IAV-human protein-protein interactions and identify 13 IAV-modulated kinases. Whole exome sequencing of patients who experienced severe influenza reveals several genes, including scaffold protein AHNAK, with predicted loss-of-function variants that are also identified in our proteomic analyses. Of our identified host factors, 54 significantly alter IAV infection upon siRNA knockdown, and two factors, AHNAK and coatomer subunit COPB1, are also essential for productive infection by SARS-CoV-2. Finally, 16 compounds targeting our identified host factors suppress IAV replication, with two targeting CDK2 and FLT3 showing pan-antiviral activity across influenza and coronavirus families. This study provides a comprehensive network model of IAV infection in human cells, identifying functional host targets for pan-viral HDT.

Annually in the U.S., the economic burden from IAV is estimated at a total of $11.2 billion1, with 3–11% of the population experiencing flu symptoms2. Symptoms of acute infection include cough, runny nose, fatigue and fever. Disease may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome or influenza-associated pneumonia in highly susceptible populations, resulting in hospitalization and/or death. IAV circulates yearly as seasonal infections, and zoonotic introduction of new IAV strains can result in a pandemic. For example, influenza A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (pH1N1)-like viruses, the causative agents of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, infected an estimated 11–21% of the world’s population in the first year of circulation3 and caused 200,000 deaths worldwide4, including many young healthy adults who lacked pre-existing immunity. In comparison, influenza A/Wyoming/03/2003 H3N2 (H3N2), a strain from the 2003–2004 flu season that originally entered the human population in 1968, has average transmissibility but causes increased disease severity5. Together, pH1N1-like and H3N2 subtypes are the predominant IAV strains that circulate each season and are targeted each year by vaccination. Not all zoonotic transmissions result in sustained human-human transmission. For example, influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 (H5N1) is an avian-derived strain from a 2003–2004 outbreak that caused a small-scale epidemic of human infections after zoonotic transmission from birds, and resulted in severe respiratory disease and >50% mortality rate6. While human-to-human transmission is rare, previous studies showed a handful of mutations in H5N1 impart airborne transmissibility in ferrets7,8, suggesting that H5N1 could mutate to gain transmissibility between mammals and may represent a future risk for pandemic influenza among humans.Due to antigenic drift, antigenic shift and zoonotic transmission, distinct strains of IAV novel to the human population emerge that have altered transmissibility, pathogenicity and pandemic potential9,10. This genetic diversity poses challenges to preventative care and antiviral treatment. Vaccines are developed and administered each year, but have limited and variable effectiveness11. There are three classes of approved antiviral therapeutics that target IAV proteins, however increasing prevalence of drug resistance mutations have limited their effectiveness, particularly against seasonal IAV strains12,13,14. Moreover, antiviral treatment necessitates very early administration after first symptoms to demonstrate some benefit. IAV’s annual burden, potential for future global pandemics and resistance to current treatments highlight a continued need for developing new therapeutics effective against multiple IAV strains.Host-directed therapies (HDTs) offer an alternative therapeutic approach by targeting host factors essential to virus replication rather than directly targeting viral-encoded factors. Thus, HDTs largely side-step the challenge of developed drug resistance and have the potential for pan-viral efficacy, as many diverse viruses utilize the same host pathways15,16,17. Proteomic approaches that identify virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and virus-induced changes in host signaling pathways can pinpoint key host linchpins essential to virus propagation18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33. Global IAV-human PPI networks previously generated with lab-adapted IAV strains in immortalized cell lines and in yeast offer good foundations for identifying essential host proteins for IAV infection24,28,29,30,34. However, the overlap between these studies is limited, and most studies relied on cell models that do not represent physiological targets of IAV infection. Combining proteomics with other global approaches such as functional genomics and chemoinformatics can yield actionable HDT targets21,35. We and others have demonstrated the utility of a cross-discipline, integrative approach for generating comprehensive models of host reprogramming by a variety of other viral pathogens, and have used these models to identify promising drug candidates18,19,20,22,23,36,37.IAV co-circulates with other respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 that continues to be a global human health emergency. More transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have continued to emerge, many of which have carried resistance mutations to different monoclonal antibody therapeutics38,39,40,41,42. It is predicted that SARS-CoV-2 will become endemic and may require regular administration of reformulated vaccine boosters, similar to IAV43. Currently, infection by either virus is treated separately by pharmacological or antibody-based antiviral therapeutics approved for clinical use against either SARS-CoV-2 or IAV. Targeting human proteins essential for infection by both viruses could provide pan-respiratory virus HDT.Here, we employ an integrative systems biology approach to identify human proteins essential for replication across three strains of IAV and SARS-CoV-2. Using affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), we identify 332 IAV-human PPIs of pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 IAV in three cell types that represent primary and secondary targets of infection. Global proteomic profiling of IAV-infected cells reveals changes in human protein abundance and phosphorylation sites, as well as 13 kinases with changing activity in IAV infection. Whole exome sequencing (WES) data of IAV-infected patients identifies a number of genes with putative loss-of-function (pLOF) variants, including structural scaffold protein AHNAK, that are associated with severe influenza disease and significantly change in our cellular proteomic data. In addition, we perform functional genomic screening of host targets identified in our proteomic dataset and discover 54 human genes that regulate IAV infection, two of which are also important for SARS-CoV-2 replication (AHNAK and COPB1). Lastly, we test 37 host protein-targeting compounds from our proteomic data and from previously published SARS-CoV-2 phosphorylation data19 against pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 IAV, and find 16 compounds that suppress replication of multiple IAV strains, 5 of which also show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, these represent promising antiviral gene targets and potential compounds for future pan-respiratory virus HDT.ResultsAP-MS Identifies 332 pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 IAV-Human PPIsWe employed a two-pronged proteomics approach and patient exome sequencing to characterize pan-IAV-human protein interactions and identify putative targets for functional genetic and pharmacological testing (Supplementary Fig. 1). We first performed AP-MS to map PPI networks for pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 IAV in A549, NHBE and differentiated THP-1 cells (Fig. 1A). We codon-optimized and cloned 13 2X-Strep-tagged virus proteins (PB2, PB1, N40, PB1-F2, PA, PA-X, HA, NP, NA, M1, M2, NS1, NEP) across the three IAV strains (pH1N1, H3N2, H5N1) (Supplementary Fig. 2A). All 13 proteins are encoded by pH1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 except PB1-F2, which contains a premature stop codon in the pH1N1 viral genome and is not expressed44,45. For each cell type after lentiviral transduction, three replicates were treated with universal type I interferon to stimulate an antiviral-like state, and three replicates remained untreated. There were little discernible differences in observed PPIs between interferon-treated and untreated samples, therefore samples were combined totaling six biological replicates (see Methods for details). Eight IAV proteins from all three strains were stably expressed in all three cell types, and all 13 proteins were expressed in at least one cell type for at least one strain, totaling 677 AP-MS samples collected across three IAV strains from three cell types (Supplementary Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. 3). Data searched by MaxQuant46 and scored by Mass Spectrometry Interaction Statistics (MiST)47 identified 332 total high-confidence PPIs across all strains and human cell types, mapping to a total of 214 human prey proteins (Supplementary Data 1).Fig. 1: AP-MS identifies 332 pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 IAV-human PPIs.A AP-MS experiment design. 13 2X-Strep-tagged proteins from pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 IAV were individually transduced by lentivirus to generate stable A549, NHBE and THP-1 cell lines. A549 and NHBE cells were cultured as polyclonal pools. THP-1 cells were cultured as monoclonal isolates and subsequently treated with Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) to induce differentiation into a macrophage-like state. All cells were treated with doxycycline to induce IAV protein expression for 24 hours and subsequently lysed. Affinity-purified IAV proteins and co-purified human proteins were identified by MS and scored to assign interaction confidence. B Venn diagram of unique IAV-human PPIs identified in each cell type. The total 332 high-confidence PPIs were unified across virus strains, resulting in 257 unique PPIs by cell type and 29 PPIs that are shared in at least two of the three cell types (grey shading). C Bar graph of the unique IAV-human PPIs identified for each IAV protein and strain. PPI numbers reported are unified across cell types. D Identification correlation matrix comparing the human interacting proteins identified by AP-MS in this study with other published studies that used AP-MS with affinity-tagged IAV proteins exogenously expressed in cell lines28,30, AP-MS in the context of virus infection24,29, and an orthologous yeast two-hybrid approach34. E Comparison of shared protein interactions (PPI similarity) by Jaccard index against IAV protein sequence similarity. PPIs reported are unified across cell types. F Heatmap of gene ontology (GO) molecular function enrichments among the human interacting proteins of indicated IAV proteins, unified across all strains and cell types and clustered by correlation of enrichment profiles. GO terms were curated from the top 3 non-redundant terms with at least 2 genes for at least one IAV protein. Increasing shading intensity reflects increasing significance of the enrichment term. Number of proteins per enriched cluster are shown in white if significant (adjusted p-value < 0.002; one-sided Fisher’s exact test), and grey if not significant (adjusted p-value > 0.002; one-sided Fisher’s exact test).Full size imageTaking the union of all PPIs across the three strains, we identified 111 PPIs from A549 cells, 89 PPIs from NHBE cells and 57 PPIs from differentiated THP-1 cells (Fig. 1B). 29/257 PPIs are shared by at least two of the three cell types, indicating that using multiple cell types substantially expanded the number of PPIs captured to give a comprehensive snapshot of IAV-human interactions. Taking the union of all PPIs across the three cell types, we identified 77 PPIs with pH1N1 among 8 IAV proteins, 77 PPIs with H3N2 among 10 IAV proteins and 142 PPIs with H5N1 among 11 IAV proteins (Fig. 1C). For all three virus strains, NA was expressed at low levels in A549 cells, and not expressed in NHBE or THP-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3), therefore no protein interactions passed scoring thresholds. In comparison to a yeast two-hybrid study34, we observed higher similarity by odds ratio between our study and others that performed AP-MS with exogenously expressed IAV proteins24,28,29,30 (Fig. 1D). In total, we discovered 44 novel interactors of IAV that were not found by these previous studies (Supplementary Data 1).We found a positive correlation between protein sequence similarity and PPI similarity (Fig. 1E), and observed that homologous and non-homologous IAV proteins with high sequence similarity share PPIs, highlighting protein sequence as a driving factor in determining these interactions (Supplementary Fig. 2C, D). For example, N40 is a N-terminal truncation product alternatively translated from the RNA segment encoding PB1, missing only 39 amino acids of PB148. PB1 and N40 share four unique PPIs (36.4% of total unique PB1 PPIs and 50% of total unique N40 PPIs). The functional significance of overlapping PPIs with PB1 is unknown as N40’s function is less understood. Between strains, IAV NP has the highest number of shared PPIs (Supplementary Fig. 2E), potentially due to high sequence conservation of NP (Supplementary Fig. 2C)49,50, and NP’s conserved role in viral RNA binding, transcription, trafficking and packaging. pH1N1 NP shares 18 PPIs (85.7% of its total PPIs), H3N2 NP shares 19 PPIs (95% of its total PPIs), and H5N1 NP shares 17 PPIs (56.6% of its total PPIs). Overlap between both homologous and non-homologous IAV proteins is increased when comparing biological pathways among PPIs (Supplementary Fig. 2F). This suggests that while IAV proteins of the different virus strains may target different specific human proteins, they co-opt similar processes or pathways. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the PPIs for each IAV protein identified molecular functions previously associated with given IAV proteins (Fig. 1F, Supplementary Data 1). For example, NS1 interactors are enriched for double-stranded RNA binding proteins, consistent with reports showing that NS1 binds double-stranded RNA to abrogate cellular double-stranded RNA signaling pathways51,52. NEP interactors are enriched for actin filament binding, which may expand on NEP’s known role in nuclear export of viral RNA53 and could indicate a novel function for NEP in post-export association with and trafficking of viral RNA along cytoskeleton filaments54. Enrichment terms also characterize IAV proteins of unknown function, such as heat shock protein binding and chaperone binding for N40, which may indicate a novel role for N40 in protein translation and/or stability. PB2 and HA have no significant enrichments that passed our thresholds, due to the small number of PPIs (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Data 1). However, M1, which also has a small number of PPIs, showed significant enrichment in PPIs with translational elongation factor activity. M1 known functions include facilitating nuclear export and trafficking of viral RNA55,56; it is unclear if these PPIs are involved in this activity or indicate an independent, novel function for M1.IAV PPI networks from three cell types identify strain-specific and pan-IAV-human interactionsThe collective 332 high-confidence PPIs include interactions between: 108 human proteins and nine IAV proteins in A549 cells; 88 human proteins and eight IAV proteins in NHBE cells; and 56 human proteins and eight IAV proteins in THP-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4). Interactions shared across multiple cell types include cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPSF) complex members that interact with NS1 in all three cell types, spliceosome components that interact with NP in NHBE and THP-1 cells, and mitochondrial ribosome subunits that interact with NP in NHBE and THP-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4). These complexes have known roles in IAV infection, such as NS1 interacting with the CPSF complex to post-transcriptionally dampen host mRNA expression and innate immune response57,58. While the majority of the IAV-human PPIs appear cell type-specific, it should be noted that some viral proteins did not express consistently in all cell types (Supplementary Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. 3), and some high-confidence PPIs identified in one cell type were also identified in other cell types but below our stringent scoring thresholds (Supplementary Data 1).Noting the small PPI overlap between cell types (Fig. 1B), we reasoned the three cell types collectively provide a representative snapshot of IAV-human interactions. We therefore took the union of all PPIs across the three cell-type specific networks to generate one unified interactome to visualize pan-IAV and strain-specific interactions between 214 human proteins and 12 IAV proteins (Fig. 2). Interactions shared by all three strains are represented by tricolored nodes and include proteins involved in: the spliceosome (NP, 11 interactors), CDC5L complex (M2, 3 interactors), mitochondrial ribosome (NP, 17 interactors), 60 S ribosome (PA, 3 interactors), nuclear transport (M2, 10 interactors), macroautophagy (M2 and PB1-F2, 2 interactors), and proton transport (M2, 2 interactors) (Fig. 2). These pan-IAV PPIs may indicate high functional importance for infection, and their corresponding biological processes are consistent with known essential roles of the interacting IAV proteins in viral genome replication and translation (NP, PA) and viral assembly or entry and budding (M2)59. The interactome also highlights strain-specific PPIs represented by nodes with one or two colors, which are most noticeable among NS1, PA-X and PB1-F2, viral proteins largely involved in host response (Fig. 2). These may represent unique co-opting of host protein complexes by each strain. For example, NS1 interactions are predominantly identified with pH1N1 and H3N2, including four PI3K signaling components, consistent with prior data showing that NS1 activates PI3K signaling during infection to modulate host apoptotic response60,61. While H5N1 NS1 sufficiently expressed in THP-1 cells, H5N1 NS1 had low expression by Western blot in A549 and NHBE cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). Consequently, most interactions for H5N1 NS1 did not pass stringent scoring thresholds (Supplementary Data 1), with the exception of PIK3R2. Likewise, H3N2 PB1-F2 interactions are largely involved in protein chaperone activity, while H5N1 PB1-F2 interactions are part of the S100A10-Annexin 2 protein complex that has roles in membrane trafficking, connecting cytoskeletal components to the cell membrane, and cell adhesion62. It is unknown if the PB1-F2 interactions identified in our network contribute to its known activities in apoptosis, innate immune response, and IAV virulence63,64,65, or suggest potential novel cellular roles.Fig. 2: IAV PPI networks from three cell types identify strain-specific and pan-IAV-human interactions.High-confidence IAV-human PPIs between 12 IAV proteins (grey diamonds) and 214 human proteins (circular nodes) identified from three IAV strains unified across the three cell types. Human protein nodes are split into three sections and colored by the IAV strain for which the interaction was identified: pH1N1 (blue), H3N2 (green) and H5N1 (purple). Color shading is proportional to MiST PPI confidence score (scale at bottom; not identified represented by white color), enabling visualization of high-confidence interactions that scored above our MiST score thresholds and interactions with additional IAV strain(s) detected in our AP-MS data that fell below our MiST score thresholds. For PPIs that are shared between multiple IAV proteins or cell types, the maximum MiST score from either IAV protein or cell type is reported in the network for each strain. IAV-human PPIs are depicted (dark grey lines), and human-human PPIs are identified (light grey lines) as curated in the CORUM130 database. Human protein complexes (yellow halo) are labeled as described in CORUM130, and biological processes (pink halo) are labeled as described by GO terms.Full size imageSome IAV-interacting host proteins in our network have been previously reported (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Data 1), which lends confidence to our network. For example, vacuolar ATPase catalytic subunit component ATP6V1A is functionally important for IAV entry66,67. In our study, ATP6V1A interacts with M2 from all three IAV strains in all three cell types (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 4). ATP6V1A had the highest MiST interaction confidence score with H5N1 M2 in all three cell types (Supplementary Data 1), therefore we validated this interaction by endogenous reciprocal IP in H5N1-infected A549 cells. Using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) MS, we show that H5N1 M2 pulls down with ATP6V1A and is enriched (log2 fold change 1.2) compared to an IgG control pulldown in H5N1-infected A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B, Supplementary Data 1). In addition to known interactions, our IAV-host network also identified novel PPIs, such as NEP interactors involved in cytoskeletal regulation and RNA binding, including structural scaffold protein AHNAK (Fig. 2). AHNAK interacts with H5N1 NEP in NHBE cells (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Data 1), and reciprocal pulldown of endogenous AHNAK in H5N1-infected NHBE cells co-purified NEP with an enrichment of log2 fold change 2 compared to an IgG1 control pulldown in H5N1-infected NHBE cells (Supplementary Fig. 5C, D, Supplementary Data 1). We also demonstrate that AHNAK and NEP both localize to the cytoplasm in IAV-infected NHBE cells (Supplementary Fig. 5E). While HA is reported to interact with CANX for proper HA folding and processing at the ER24,68, three HA PPIs with ER protein quality control machinery in our network (ERLEC1, SEL1L, P4HB) are novel and may identify additional human proteins involved in HA folding and processing. These are specific to H3N2 HA and A549 cells in our network (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Data 1), but it should be noted that pH1N1 HA did not express in A549 and HA from all strains did not express in NHBE or THP-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). Lastly, we identified eight high-confidence human protein interactors of N40, including six that are involved in protein quality control machinery, indicating a potential novel cellular role for under-characterized N40 in modulating human and/or viral protein expression. Collectively, the interactome highlights the rich biology of human proteins and pathways targeted by three strains of IAV.Global proteomic profiling highlights 13 modulated kinases in IAV infectionIn an orthogonal proteomic approach, we performed global protein abundance and phosphorylation profiling on pH1N1, H3N2 or H5N1 IAV-infected primary NHBE and differentiated THP-1 cells at four time points post-infection to identify IAV-modulated host signaling pathways (Fig. 3A). MS data searched by MaxQuant46 and quantified by MSstats69 identified hundreds of significant protein abundance changes and site-specific phosphorylation events that occur over the time course of infection for each IAV strain in each cell type (Fig. 3B, C, Supplementary Data 2). We detected increasing IAV NP abundance across the collected time points, indicating productive infection, though this rise varied slightly by strain (Fig. 3D). Not all time points passed MS quality control (e.g. 12 hours in THP-1 cells), and we therefore selected a single time point representing peak IAV infection for all subsequent analyses where NP abundance reached comparable high levels across the strains (Fig. 3D). Moderate overlap in phosphorylation events was observed between the three strains, with the seasonal circulating IAV strains (pH1N1 and H3N2) sharing a larger overlap with each other than with avian-derived H5N1 (Supplementary Fig. 5F). Proteins with increased phosphorylation in at least one site across all strains were functionally enriched in RNA splicing and processing, cellular and nuclear membranes, regulation of gene silencing, and innate immune response (Supplementary Fig. 5G, Supplementary Data 2), consistent with IAV co-opting host RNA machinery to splice and translate viral RNA, IAV entry and exit, viral-induced gene silencing by blocking nuclear export of host mRNA, and cellular detection and response to virus59,70.Fig. 3: Global proteomic profiling highlights 13 modulated kinases in IAV infection.A Experimental design workflow for global proteomic profiling of protein abundance (AB) and phosphorylation (PH) changes in NHBE and PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells infected in biological duplicate with pH1N1, H3N2 or H5N1 IAV (MOI 2, four time points post-infection with time-matched mocks). B–D AB data are not available (N/A) for pH1N1 and H3N2 IAV at the 12-hour time point in THP-1 cells, as these samples did not pass MS quality control. Bar chart plotting the total number of (B) proteins from the AB dataset and (C) phosphorylation sites from the PH dataset quantified at each time point (light red=significantly increased; light blue=significantly decreased; dark red=only detected in IAV infection; dark blue=only detected in mock infection; grey=no significant change). D Log2 intensity of IAV NP AB detected over the time course of pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 IAV infection in NHBE and THP-1 cells. E–G All represented data corresponds to 18 hours (pH1N1, H3N2) and 12 hours (H5N1) post-IAV infection. E Correlation of the PH and AB data for all peptides where significant changes in both protein PH and AB could be measured (green=PH-AB change in the same direction; yellow=PH-AB change in the opposite direction; grey=no significant AB changes). Correlation data is represented as a total across all virus strains and cell types. F Heatmap of predicted kinase activity (kinase Z score) with FDR < 0.05 from IAV-infected NHBE and THP-1 cells (red=increased activity; blue=decreased activity; grey=not detected). G IAV-human PPI map of 10 IAV proteins (grey diamonds) interacting with 45 human proteins (small white circles) that possess significantly changing phosphorylation sites (adjusted p-value < 0.05; two-sided t-test). Significantly changing phosphorylation sites (emanating large circular nodes) are stratified by IAV strain (pie sections) and colored by the maximum log2 fold change (log2FC) (IAV/mock; red=increase, blue=decrease, grey=not detected). Phosphorylation sites detected across multiple cell lines are represented by the maximum absolute value, non-infinite fold change.Full size imageSince protein phosphorylation changes reflect changes in kinase activities, we next leveraged our phosphoproteomic data to predict kinases with altered activity during IAV infection. We observed a weak correlation between protein and phosphorylation site abundance changes, suggesting that the observed phosphorylation changes are largely not driven or biased by changes in protein abundance (Fig. 3E, Supplementary Fig. 5H). Using a comprehensive catalog to map kinase-substrate relationships71 with substrate proteins identified in our phosphorylation data and in-house scoring criteria to increase confidence of kinase activity annotations (Methods), we identified 13 kinases with activity changes during IAV infection (Fig. 3F, Supplementary Data 2). In NHBE and THP-1 cells, five mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members (MAP2K3, MAP2K6, MAPKAPK2, MAPKAPK3, MAPKAPK5) showed decreased activity or no significant change during pH1N1 infection, and increased activity during H3N2 and H5N1 infection (Fig. 3F). This may be directly related to the differential capacity of NS1 from different strains to activate JNK and PI3K signaling72. This trend is also observed for two ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6K) family members (RPS6KB1, RPS6KB2) (Fig. 3F), although the functional significance is unclear. In THP-1 cells, one member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase family (PRKDC) showed increased activity during pH1N1 and H3N2 infection, and no significant change during H5N1 infection (Fig. 3F). This may indicate a macrophage-specific response via PRKDC with the predominant human-infecting IAV strains. Collectively, these predictions identify differential kinase activity patterns during infection, and may be indicative of the different IAV strain pathogenicities and host responses.Overlaying PPI and phosphoproteomics results identified 45 human proteins with IAV-modulated phosphorylation sites that interact with at least one IAV protein (Fig. 3G). For some PPIs, the phosphoregulation pattern is consistent across all three strains and may represent pan-IAV functionality in infection and host response. For example, CANX, an H3N2 HA interactor, was downregulated in phosphorylation at Serine 583 (S583) by all three IAV strains in both THP-1 and NHBE cells. SRSF2, a pH1N1 PA-X interactor, was universally upregulated at S208 by all three IAV strains. For other PPIs, phosphorylation is differentially regulated by IAV strain and may represent strain-specific regulation of protein activity or localization. One example is CPSF4, a well-known NS1 interactor that blocks nuclear export of host pre-mRNA and post-transcriptionally inhibits the production of interferon-stimulated genes as part of NS1-mediated host cell shutoff57,58,73,74. Here, CPSF4 S200 phosphorylation was regulated in a strain-specific manner, with decreased phosphorylation during pH1N1 and H3N2 infection and increased phosphorylation during H5N1 infection (Fig. 3G). Strain-specific differences in the functionality of CPSF4-NS1 interaction have been reported, namely pH1N1 NS1 is unable to block mRNA export and stimulate mRNA translation as efficiently as H5N1 subtype virus73,74. While most PPIs were mapped with one or two IAV-modulated phosphorylation sites, five PPIs had four or more IAV-regulated phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3G). These include DNA damage-sensing kinase PRKDC, an M2 PPI that was upregulated in activity during infection (Fig. 3F) and had five upregulated phosphorylation sites upon pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 infection (Fig. 3G); and AHNAK, a large (~700 kDa) scaffold protein and an NEP PPI that had 11 IAV-modulated phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3G). The additional layer of phosphoregulation during IAV infection for IAV-human PPIs, including PRKDC and AHNAK, may highlight increased functional importance of the interaction in infection.Patient exome sequencing identifies gene variants encoding proteins that are regulated in AB and PH during IAV infectionTo investigate the clinical implications of our proteomic datasets, we explored the correlation between proteins we found to be regulated in cell models of IAV infection and patient responses to IAV. To this end, we obtained de-identified human blood samples following informed consent from individuals at five eMERGE study sites. We used principal components analysis (PCA) to characterize the genetic ancestry of the study population and identified 495 individuals of genetically-identified European Ancestry, of whom 161 were hospitalized with severe influenza infection and 334 served as outpatient controls (Fig. 4A). We used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes as the phenotypic trait for the analysis. Whole exome sequencing of the 495 participants achieved 97% coverage of targeted bases at a depth of ≥ 20x. In total across all participants, we identified 3,621,267 variants in 22 million base pairs across the coding regions of 22,621 genes, of which 90% were rare variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) < 1%). There was no evidence of site-specific effects or other systematic biases in the analysis of the filtered data.Fig. 4: Patient exome sequencing identifies gene variants encoding proteins that are regulated in AB and PH during IAV infection.A Schematic representation of sample collection and data analysis for identifying genes with pLOF variants associated with severe influenza disease from an influenza patient cohort.

H Multiple sequence alignment sequence LOGO (S210P/Q, middle) for phosphorylation disruption mutations in AHNAK created with WebLogo version 2.8.2148 using motifs identified by pLOF analysis as likely to be loss of phosphorylation.Full size imageIn order to investigate whether proteins from our proteomics study impinged on genes with variants associated with severe influenza disease, we searched for predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) variants in our proteomic datasets. We focused on pLOF variants as these are not only easier to predict75,76,77, but have more understandable molecular consequences than gain-of-function or synonymous mutations. We identified 196,832 total variants in genes corresponding to the 3658 AB, 3656 PH, and 214 PPI proteins that we detected in our proteomic datasets (Supplementary Data 3). Variants were classified as pLOF if identified as nonsynonymous exonic, frameshift substitution or stop gain/loss (MAF < 1%), and predicted deleterious from any of six annotation algorithms (Supplementary Data 3). In total, 2808 AB genes, 3092 PH genes, and 177 PPI genes had pLOF variants, however, since the power to detect singletons is limited by their low frequency, we used a gene-based collapsing method by which rare mutations are considered jointly for association analysis78. After gene-based collapsing, 1082 AB genes, 2336 PH genes, and 118 PPI genes were tested for association with severe influenza disease (Fig. 4B). We identified 24 AB, 49 PH and 5 PPI significant severe disease-associated genes with pLOF variants (FDR < 0.05) (Supplementary Data 3). For further analyses between genes with pLOF variants and our proteomic dataset, we considered 95 AB, 161 PH and 7 PPI genes as moderately significant genes with pLOF variants associated with severe disease (FDR < 0.1) to include more genes with smaller effects (Fig. 4B–D). Looking at the overlap of our proteomic and patient datasets, we found 23 AB and 52 PH genes with pLOF variants to be significantly regulated during IAV infection (Fig. 4C, E, F). From the list of phosphorylation sites identified in our proteomic data, we also identified pLOF nonsynonymous mutations at predicted phospho-serine, phospho-threonine, and phospho-tyrosine sites for each of the AB, PH and PPI datasets (Supplementary Data 3). We identified phospho-variants in 75 AB genes, 146 PH genes and 6 PPI genes (Supplementary Data 3).At the convergence of our proteomic and pLOF analyses are 44 proteins with pLOF variants that were detected in all three proteomic datasets: AB, PH, and PPI (Fig. 4D). Focusing on these proteomically detected genes with pLOF variants and looking at the average of the severe influenza disease association FDR across the three dataset tests, we find two surpassing our significance threshold (FDR < 0.1): AHNAK and SEL1L. SEL1L interacts with H3N2 HA, and while detected in both AB and PH datasets, it is not significantly regulated during IAV infection at the protein level. In contrast, we find that AHNAK, a H5N1 NEP interactor, is significantly downregulated in protein AB by all three IAV strains in both NHBE and THP1 cells (Fig. 4E), and has significant changes in phosphorylation at a number of phosphorylation sites in at least one cell type by at least one IAV strain (Fig. 4F). Looking at all AHNAK predicted phosphorylation sites, as well as all of the significantly regulated phosphorylation sites in our dataset (including infinite quantification values) (Fig. 4G), we found serine position 210 contained phosphorylation disruption mutations of serine to proline or glutamine (S210P/Q) that was significantly associated with severe disease (FDR < 0.05) (Fig. 4H, Supplementary Data 3). Interestingly, AHNAK phosphorylation at S210 was also regulated during infection of Calu-3 cells with early-lineage or Alpha variant SARS-CoV-279,80. Together, our data pinpoints how molecular regulation of AHNAK in response to infection could be reflective of the systemic effect of AHNAK as it relates to disease severity in the host.siRNA knockdown identifies 54 pro-viral and antiviral factors of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infectionTo functionally validate PPI and kinase factors in IAV infection, we adapted an arrayed siRNA screening approach81 in A549 cells to identify host proteins whose knockdown suppressed infection (pro-viral factors) or enhanced infection (antiviral factors) (Fig. 5A). A total of 290 genes were knocked down in biological duplicate, and include: (1) 212/214 IAV interacting proteins that were targetable by siRNA; and (2) a panel of 64 kinases (including 12 kinases from Fig. 3F) and 14 phosphorylated proteins (Supplementary Data 4). Knockdown cells were immunostained for IAV NP and quantified by flow cytometry for percent NP-positive (%NP + ) cells as a readout for percent IAV infection (Supplementary Fig. 6A). We then calculated the log2 fold change in %NP-positive (NP + ) cells of experimental siRNA against the mean of multiple non-targeting (NT) control siRNA. To assess if siRNA knockdown affected viability, we performed cell viability staining which showed siRNA knockdown cells were above 92% viable (Supplementary Data 4). Since siRNA knockdown alone did not meaningfully reduce cell viability, we next asked if cell viability resulting from the combination of siRNA knockdown and IAV infection biased observed changes in IAV infection. Increased or decreased IAV infection was not correlated with increased or decreased viability of cells with siRNA knockdown and IAV infection (Fig. 5B), therefore no gene knockdowns were removed from analysis due to toxicity. The two replicates showed a good correlation (R2 = 0.78) for log2 fold change in IAV infection (Fig. 5C). As expected, NT control siRNA did not affect IAV infection (black dots, Fig. 5C), and IAV NP-targeting siRNA inhibited IAV infection (green dots, Fig. 5C).Fig. 5: siRNA knockdown identifies 54 pro-viral and antiviral factors of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection.A Arrayed siRNA screen approach in A549 cells reverse-transfected in n = 2 biologically independent samples with gene-targeting, non-targeting (NT) or IAV NP-targeting siRNA, and infected with Influenza A/WSN/1933 H1N1 (MOI 0.1, 24 hours). Cell viability (live-cell staining) and percent IAV infection (%NP-positive (%NP + ) cells; immunostaining for IAV NP) were quantified by flow cytometry. Correlation plots comparing: B the cell viability against IAV infection for each siRNA from each biological duplicate; or C the variation in IAV infection between the biological duplicates. Log2FC was calculated by normalizing %viable or %NP+ cells for each siRNA against the mean of multiple replicate-matched NT siRNA (siRNA/mean NT) (green dots=IAV NP-targeting siRNA, black dots=NT siRNA, grey dots=experimental gene-targeting siRNA). Distribution of log2FC in IAV infection for (D) 212 PPI targets and (E) 78 PH targets, plotted as the mean of n = 2 biologically independent samples per target. The log2FC in IAV infection was calculated for each siRNA against the mean replicate-matched NT siRNA (blue dots=pro-viral factors (mean log2FC < -2), red dots=antiviral factors (mean log2FC > 2), grey dots=no/weak phenotype; green dot=IAV NP-targeting siRNA; black dot=NT siRNA; error bars represent standard deviation). F Distribution of log2FC in SARS-CoV-2 infection for 44 IAV PPI targets plotted as the median of six replicates (n = 2 biologically independent samples, each in n = 3 technical replicates) per target. The log2FC in SARS-CoV-2 infection was calculated for each siRNA against a replicate-matched NT siRNA (blue dots=pro-viral factors (median log2FC < -2), red dots=antiviral factors (median log2FC > 2), grey dots=no/weak phenotype; green dot=ACE2-targeting siRNA; black dot=NT siRNA; error bars represent median absolute deviations (MAD)). G Bar chart of pro-viral and antiviral factors for IAV and SARS-CoV-2 screens plotted as the mean log2FC in IAV infection (data re-plotted from D and E; error bars represent standard deviation) and the median log2FC in SARS-CoV-2 infection (data re-plotted from F; error bars represent MAD).Full size imageWe classified pro-viral and antiviral factors using a threshold log2 fold change of ≤ -2 or ≥ 2, respectively, for the IAV PPI and PH screens (Fig. 5D, E, Supplementary Data 4). Using this cutoff for the PPI screen, we classified 44 genes as regulators of IAV infection, of which 37 were pro-viral and 7 were antiviral factors (Fig. 5D). These 44 functional proteins interact with 12 IAV proteins, corresponding to at least one functional interaction per IAV protein. In comparison to previous genome-wide siRNA knockdown studies66,82,83,84, we identified 37 novel human proteins that functionally affect IAV infection. Whereas the referenced genome-wide screens reported a < 2% hit rate for identifying genes that functionally affect IAV infection, our AP-MS-based strategy achieved a higher hit rate (20.6%) for identifying functional nodes. This is consistent with previous findings that genetic screens based on PPI data show ten-fold higher hit rates for identifying functional factors of infection by IAV and other viruses30,85. From the PH targets, 10 were classified as pro-viral factors and include two IAV-regulated phosphoproteins and eight kinases (Fig. 5E, Supplementary Data 4). Collectively among both screens, 47 host factors that regulated IAV infection are pro-viral, highlighting the strength of proteomics-based technologies in identifying human protein nodes critical to infection.SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory RNA virus that infects similar cell types as IAV and may target similar host proteins for infection, therefore we endeavored to identify human proteins essential for both viruses. We knocked down the 54 functional IAV host factors identified above and challenged these cells with SARS-CoV-2. Cells were assessed for viability with siRNA knockdown by cytotox staining and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1 for 72 hours, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was quantified by RT-qPCR against viral N protein. Cell viability staining showed siRNA knockdown cells had a median cell viability ranging 94.3-99.1% of all siRNA knockdown cells across the replicates (Supplementary Data 4). We calculated the log2 fold change of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in knockdown cells for experimental siRNA against replicate-matched NT siRNA, and classified pro-viral and antiviral factors using a threshold of median log2 fold change ≤ -2 or ≥ 2, respectively. This identified three IAV PPI factors that regulated SARS-CoV-2 infection: COPB1, AHNAK and RUVBL2 (Fig. 5F, Supplementary Data 4). While we report these three proteins as IAV PPIs, to our knowledge, none are previously reported as PPIs with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. AHNAK was profiled as an RNA binding protein whose RNA binding kinetics peak early in SARS-CoV-2 infection86. No siRNA knockdowns from the PH dataset passed our log2 fold change thresholding criteria for SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 6B), however, 7 out of 10 PH targets mildly decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection with significance (p-value < 0.02) (Supplementary Data 4). Collectively, we classified 54 regulators of IAV infection, three of which act as pan-respiratory virus regulators of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 5G).Host-directed compounds targeting IAV and SARS-CoV-2 host factors identify inhibitors of pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 IAV infectionTo identify potential HDT against IAV infection, we screened compounds targeting a subset of the 44 siRNA-validated pro-viral and antiviral PPI factors and 13 kinases with IAV-modulated activity changes (Fig. 6A). 20 host proteins were targetable by at least one compound, and include 8 PPIs (targeted by total 16 compounds) and 12 kinases (targeted by total 15 compounds), with two host proteins identified as both PPIs and kinases (total 29 unique compounds). Overlaying our phosphorylation data of IAV infection in human NHBE and THP-1 cells with phosphorylation data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells19 and human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells79, we noted eleven shared kinases (Supplementary Fig. 6C) with similar predicted kinase activity profiles upon infection by both IAV (Supplementary Data 2) and SARS-CoV-219,79 (Supplementary Fig. 6D). For example, MAPK signaling members (MAP2K3, MAP2K6, MAPKAPK3, MAPKAPK5, MAPKAPK2, MAPK13) and RPS6K signaling members (RPS6KB1 and RPS6B2) showed increased activity, and CDK2 showed deceased activity (Supplementary Fig. 6D). Therefore, we leveraged known kinase-targeting SARS-CoV-2 antiviral compounds19 and additionally tested these for potential dual activity against IAV (Fig. 6A). A total of 37 unique host-directed compounds were screened against pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 IAV infection in A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. 7, Supplementary Data 5). In total, we identified 16 compounds with antiviral activity against at least one IAV strain, with 7 compounds showing pan-IAV antiviral activity (Supplementary Data 5).Fig. 6: Host-directed compounds targeting IAV and SARS-CoV-2 host factors identify inhibitors of pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 IAV infection.A Compounds targeting eight IAV PPI factors and 12 IAV-modulated kinases were manually curated by literature search and selected based on target specificity and drug availability. 8 kinase-targeting compounds with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-219 were included. In total, 37 unique compounds were screened against pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 IAV infection. Compounds with selectivity index (SI) [CC50/IC50] > 2 were classified as having antiviral activity (Supplementary Data 5, see also Source Data). B–K A549 cells were pre-treated with compound at the indicated doses (2 hr) and infected with pH1N1 (MOI 0.5), H3N2 (MOI 0.5) or H5N1 (MOI 0.05) IAV for 24 hr. Percent IAV-infected cells were quantified by immunostaining for IAV NP followed by high throughput imaging (blue line=pH1N1; green line=H3N2; purple line=H5N1). Percent alive cells were quantified by MTT assay in uninfected A549 cells (black line). Data points represent the mean across n = 3 biologically independent samples. Schematics mark the target with corresponding PPI or PH dataset and IAV strain, and the corresponding compound (at left). Compounds are annotated with IC50 values for IAV strains in which SI > 2. Error bars represent standard error of mean (SEM). B–D Dose-response curves for M2 PPI-targeting compounds, including: ATP6V1A-targeting compound bafilomycin A1; ABCC1-targeting compound daunorubicin; and PRKDC-targeting compound NU7441. PRKDC is also a kinase identified in the IAV PH data. E Dose-response curve for HA PPI P4HB-targeting compound PACMA31. F–G Dose-response curves for PH kinase-targeting compounds, including: CDK2-targeting compound dinaciclib; and ULK1-targeting compound MRT68921. H Dose-response curves for members of the MAPK pathway (pathway schematic at left), including MAP2K3, MAP2K6, MAPK13 and MAPKAPK2, each annotated with corresponding compounds. PF-3644022 was not tested against pH1N1. I–K Dose-response curves for SARS-CoV-2-mined antiviral compounds targeting three kinase pathways: FLT3 and AXL targeted by gilteritinib; PI3KCA and PI3KCD targeted by pictilisib; and AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3 (pan-AKT) targeted by MK-2206. SARS-CoV-2 IC50 values are included as previously reported19, where SARS-CoV-2 infection was quantified by RT-qPCR of SARS-CoV-2 N protein in compound-treated A549-ACE2 cells.Full size imageFour compounds targeting four PPIs show antiviral activity against at least two IAV strains (Fig. 6B–E). Bafilomycin A1 which targets M2 PPI V-ATPase subunit ATP6V1A, daunorubicin which inhibits M2 PPI ATP-binding cassette subfamily member ABCC1, and PACMA31 which targets HA PPI protein disulfide-isomerase P4HB showed potent pan-IAV antiviral activity (Fig. 6B, C, E). Bafilomycin A1 has also been reported to inhibit IAV infection with PR8 H1N1 in A549 cells87. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) inhibitor NU7441 targeting M2 PPI DNA-PK PRKDC suppressed pH1N1 and H3N2 infection but not H5N1 infection (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, this strain specificity is also reflected in the phosphoproteomic data, as PRKDC showed increased kinase activity in pH1N1 and H3N2 infection but not H5N1 infection (Fig. 3F). To our knowledge, daunorubicin (ABCC1) and NU7441 (PRKDC) are novel inhibitors of IAV infection.In addition to the PRKDC kinase inhibitor, we found inhibitors of five additional kinases showed antiviral activity against IAV (Fig. 6F–H, Supplementary Data 5). Dinaciclib, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2, showed potent antiviral activity against all three strains (Fig. 6F). A previous study reported dinaciclib antiviral activity with H7N9 IAV88, further supporting broad spectrum potency. MRT68921, an inhibitor of autophagy-activating kinase ULK1, showed antiviral activity against H3N2 and H5N1 (SI > 2), and decreased pH1N1 infection (SI < 2) (Fig. 6G, Supplementary Data 5). ULK1 in complex with other proteins activates mTOR-dependent autophagy89, a pathway that is necessary for IAV infection90. To our knowledge, MRT68921 is a novel antiviral for IAV, likely acting through ULK1 inhibition to downregulate autophagy and suppress infection. Additionally, three inhibitors of four members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway showed antiviral activity (Fig. 6H). Lestaurtinib, which targets MAP2K3 and MAP2K6, showed antiviral activity against pH1N1 and H5N1 (SI > 2), and decreased H3N2 infection (SI < 2) (Fig. 6H). Interestingly, while MAP2K3 and MAP2K6 show increased predicted kinase activity in H3N2 and H5N1 IAV infection but not pH1N1 IAV infection (Fig. 3F), Lestaurtinib inhibits pH1N1 IAV infection (Fig. 6H). MAPK-13-IN-1, which targets MAPK13 (p38δ), showed broad spectrum activity with some differences in potency between the three IAV strains (Fig. 6H). Although SI values for MAPK-13-IN-1 could not be quantitatively calculated based on the concentrations we used, the lack of toxicity at the tested concentrations indicates SI is likely to be above 2 (Supplementary Data 5). PF-3644022, which targets MAPKAPK2, showed antiviral activity against H5N1, though was not tested against pH1N1 (Fig. 6H). Taken together, these three MAPK-targeting compounds suggest the MAPK signaling pathway may be essential for multiple strains of IAV infection and targetable for host-directed antiviral therapy.Three out of the eight SARS-CoV−2 antiviral compounds showed antiviral activity against at least two strains of IAV (Fig. 6I–K). Gilteritinib, which targets AXL kinase functioning upstream of p38, MAP2K3 and MAP2K6, showed antiviral activity against the three IAV strains tested (Fig. 6I). While inhibitors against MAP2K3 and MAP2K6 (lestaurtinib) and MAPK13 (p38δ) (MAPK13-IN-1) showed antiviral activity against multiple IAV strains (Fig. 6H), two SARS-CoV-2 antiviral p38 inhibitors had no effect on IAV infection (ralimetinib targeting MAPK14 (p38α) and MAPK11 (p38β); ARRY-797 targeting MAPK14 (p38α)) (Supplementary Fig. 7, Supplementary Data 5). This suggests that IAV and SARS-CoV-2 converge on upstream kinases in the MAPK pathway, and that their kinase signaling activity is essential for infection. Pictilisib targeting PIK3CA and PIK3CD also showed broad spectrum antiviral activity with strain-specific differences in potency (Fig. 6J). SI values for pictilisib could not be quantitatively calculated based on the concentrations we used, however the lack of toxicity indicates SI is likely to be above 2 (Supplementary Data 5). Previous findings that other PIK3CA-targeting compounds inhibit infection by two different IAV strains support PIK3CA as a targetable node for IAV treatment91. PIK3CA has been shown to act through PR8 H1N1 IAV protein NS161, and we identified PIK3CA as an interactor of pH1N1 NS1 (Fig. 2), but how PIK3CA regulates H3N2 and H5N1 infection is unclear. MK-2206, which targets the AKT kinases (AKT1, AKT2, AKT3), showed strong antiviral activity against H5N1 and moderate antiviral activity against pH1N1 (Fig. 6K). AKT signaling may be a unique host signaling pathway more heavily utilized by H5N1 avian-derived IAV strain. In addition to gilteritinib, pictilisib and MK-2206, pan-IAV compounds dinaciclib (targeting CDK2) (Fig. 6F) and MAPK13-IN-1 (targeting MAPK13) (Fig. 6H) are reported to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-219, representing a total of five compounds with pan-antiviral activity across IAV and SARS-CoV−2.DiscussionThis study represents an integrative systems biology approach that unifies cellular proteomic data with patient genomic data to generate a comprehensive network model of IAV infection. By studying functional host factors of circulating or zoonotic IAV strains, we identified essential, druggable host targets that may serve as potential treatment strategy alternatives to increasingly obsolete classes of IAV protein-targeting drugs. Using a two-pronged proteomic approach, we interrogated three different IAV strains (pH1N1, H3N2, and H5N1) in multiple cells types of infection (primary bronchial epithelial, lung epithelial and myeloid cell lines) and identified novel strain-specific and pan-IAV PPIs and IAV-modulated host kinase pathways. Combining the cellular proteomic data with whole exome sequencing data from an influenza patient cohort, we pinpointed a number of potential molecular regulators of host response and determinants of disease outcome. By functional genetic screening, we found 54 human genes that map back to 44 PPI factors and 10 PH factors act as pro-viral and antiviral factors in IAV infection. Three of these IAV host factors also regulate infection by SARS-CoV-2, acting as pro-viral (COPB1, AHNAK) or antiviral (RUVBL2) factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Screening compounds that target IAV-interacting and IAV-modulated proteins identified 16 compounds that suppress replication of at least one strain of IAV, with seven compounds exhibiting pan-IAV activity and five compounds inhibiting multiple strains of IAV and SARS-CoV-2. While our study focused on identifying promising antiviral targets for potential pan-viral HDT in future influenza and COVID-19 treatments, we recognize there is more to be mined from our data, especially in teasing apart strain- or cell-type specific interactions and their consequence on different disease prognoses or outcomes.Three human protein interactors of two IAV proteins targeted in antiviral drug development (M2, HA) show promising evidence as broad spectrum HDT targets. These three host proteins functionally affect IAV infection (Fig. 5G), and compounds targeting these three host factors show pan-IAV antiviral activity: daunorubicin targeting ABCC1 (M2 interactor); NU7441 targeting PRKDC (M2 interactor and IAV-modulated kinase); and PACMA31 targeting P4HB (HA interactor) (Fig. 6C–E). M2 is the IAV protein target of amantadine and rimantadine inhibitors, two classes of antivirals approved for clinical use that are now obsolete for IAV treatment due to virus resistance, particularly among 2009 pH1N1-like and H3N2 seasonal strains92,93. HA is one of the IAV proteins responsible for host cell entry by binding to sialic acid on epithelium cells, and is an attractive but challenging target for antiviral therapeutics due to high antigenic drift and shift94,95. There are no HA-targeting drugs currently available for clinical use. Recent antiviral strategies instead target human sialic acid to block HA binding and IAV entry. For example, sialic acid inhibitors were recently shown to target HA and have antiviral efficacy96. Antiviral compound Fludase (DAS181), a bacteria-derived sialidase fusion protein that cleaves sialic acid from epithelium cell surface to prevent IAV entry97, enrolled its first patient in a Phase III clinical trial in 2019 and is moving towards FDA approval and clinical use. Fludase is a promising example of a host-directed strategy to successfully treat IAV infection. Here, we identified three host-directed pre-clinical and FDA-approved compounds that target two functional IAV M2 PPIs and one HA PPI, all of which have antiviral activity against pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 IAV infection. None of these compounds are currently in clinical trials or approved for use in treating influenza. Collectively, these three compounds represent potential alternative, host-directed targets for treating influenza disease. As with all host-directed therapies, the potential toxicity associated with their use needs to be carefully addressed.IAV co-circulates seasonally with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens, which presents a significant challenge for public health. In cell models and in mice, IAV infection led to increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, increased SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, and resulted in more severe lung damage, morbidity and mortality98,99. This observation is specific to IAV in comparison to co-infection with other respiratory viruses98. IAV and SARS-CoV-2 present similar respiratory disease symptoms, and current antiviral treatment is specific to either virus. Here, we have taken a novel approach that combines genetic and pharmacological screening to identify host node vulnerabilities of both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 for potential pan-respiratory virus HDT. We challenged the 54 functional IAV PPI and PH factors by siRNA knockdown against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and identified two human genes, COPB1 and AHNAK, that act as pro-viral factors in both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 5G). A third gene, HNRNPUL2, acts as a pro-viral factor in IAV infection (Fig. 5G) and falls just below our log2 fold change cutoffs as a pro-viral factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Supplementary Data 4). While we report these factors as IAV-human PPIs (M2-COPB1, NEP-AHNAK), to our knowledge, neither are reported as SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs. COPB1, a subunit of the coatomer complex I (COPI) that is associated with non-clathrin coated vesicles and involved in endosomal transport, is essential for IAV infection in other siRNA-based studies82,83,100, although to our knowledge its interaction with IAV M2 is novel. COPB1 was also shown to be required for infection of other RNA viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus101, and the secretory pathway was shown to promote SARS-CoV viral RNA replication and synthesis102. COPB1 and its role in endosomal transport may facilitate essential steps in viral RNA synthesis and trafficking or viral assembly for IAV and SARS-CoV-2. HNRNPUL2 interacts with IAV NP in our study, and is reported to interact with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein103. IAV NP and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins share functional similarities; both proteins are viral RNA (vRNA)-binding proteins involved in encapsidation of vRNA and formation of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), vRNP trafficking, and virus replication59,104. NP and N proteins are abundantly expressed during infection, and evolutionarily conserved among related influenza viruses and coronaviruses, respectively, which make them attractive broad spectrum drug or vaccine targets104,105,106,107. HNRNPUL2, a predominantly nuclear protein with RNA binding activity whose cellular function is under-characterized, likely facilitates NP and N in essential vRNA replication or vRNP trafficking functions. While we report these three factors as promising candidates for pan-viral HDT, future work is needed to determine the specific mechanisms by which these proteins affect IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection.Out of eight compounds that show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-219 and that target kinase pathways detected in our IAV phosphorylation data, three compounds show antiviral activity against at least two IAV strains: gilteritinib, pictilisib and MK-2206 (Fig. 6I–K). As mentioned above, two additional compounds identified from our IAV PH data, dinaciclib and MAPK13-IN-1, show antiviral activity against all three strains of IAV in our study (Fig. 6F,H), and act also as antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 as reported in a previous study19. In total, five compounds from our study show antiviral activity against multiple strains of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. This highlights the power of leveraging and mining orthogonal phosphoproteomic analyses of infection by different respiratory viruses to identify novel pan-viral HDT. These five compounds target kinases of diverse pathways, and include FLT3/AXL (gilteritinib), MAPK (MAPK13-IN-1), PI3K (pictilisib), AKT (MK-2206) and CDK (dinaciclib) signaling pathways (Supplementary Data 5). None of these compounds are currently in clinical trials for influenza or COVID-19. While our results with pictilisib (targeting PI3KCA, PI3KCD) and MK-2206 (targeting AKT1, AKT2, AKT3) are novel for IAV, other PI3K and AKT signaling inhibitors are in clinical trials for influenza108. Collectively, these findings represent novel potential pan-respiratory antiviral HDT.Several protein targets are identified by multiple orthogonal data in this study and warrant further investigation. One example is AHNAK, a large, ~700 kDa structural scaffold protein that interacts with H5N1 NEP above our PPI scoring thresholds, and with pH1N1 and H3N2 NEP below our thresholds (Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 1), indicating the interaction may not be strain-specific. In our network, the AHNAK-NEP interaction is specific to NHBE cells (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Data 1) and could be a result of cell type-specificities, but may also result from experimental or protein expression and purification differences of NEP in the other cell types (Supplementary Fig. 3). Reciprocal pulldown of endogenous AHNAK co-purified H5N1 NEP in H5N1-infected NHBE cells, and both AHNAK and NEP are localized to the cytoplasm of NHBE cells during productive H5N1 IAV infection (Supplementary Fig. 5C–E). AHNAK has 11 sites that are differentially regulated in phosphorylation with pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 infection, with about half of the sites universally up- or downregulated and half of the sites regulated in strain-specific patterns (Fig. 3G). Interestingly, AHNAK is identified as a significant gene with pLOF variants associated with patients who experienced severe influenza disease (Fig. 4D), regulated in protein AB and PH during cellular IAV infection (Fig. 4E, F), and contained phosphorylation disruption mutations at site serine 210 significantly associated with severe influenza disease (Fig. 4H), indicating AHNAK may play an important role in disease outcome. AHNAK is also a pan-respiratory virus gene target, as its knockdown decreases both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 5G). AHNAK’s role in IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown, but may be tied to viral RNA export and/or virus budding. Calcium-dependent cell-cell contact formation has been shown to trigger AHNAK’s phosphorylation by protein kinase B and relocalization outside the nucleus109, localization to the plasma membrane and complex formation with S100A10-Annexin 2 complex110. AHNAK has been proposed to coordinate cytoskeleton and membrane architecture changes together with S100A10-Annexin 2 complex110,111,112. This function is important in pathogen infection with bacterium Salmonella, where AHNAK is recruited to membrane ruffles and is required for infection112. IAV NEP facilitates export of viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm53,113, and facilitates virus formation and budding at the plasma membrane through its interaction with a membrane-embedded F-type proton-translocating ATPase114. AHNAK and IAV NEP may coordinate cellular cytoskeletal and membrane remodeling for vRNP export and trafficking or IAV assembly and budding at the membrane. We found five additional human proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation interact with NEP (Fig. 2), and NEP PPIs are enriched in actin binding (Fig. 1F), which support this model. To date, no published studies show AHNAK as an interactor of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, however AHNAK was profiled as an RNA binding protein whose RNA binding kinetics peak early in SARS-CoV-2 infection86. Our study uniquely identifies AHNAK as essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection, perhaps through AHNAK’s interaction with viral RNA that may play a critical role in viral RNA production, trafficking or assembly during infection.In summary, this study highlights the unique strength of an integrative systems biology approach to generate multi-dimensional data profiling IAV, and identify functional and druggable human proteins essential for IAV infection. By utilizing AP-MS, global proteomics, patient exome sequencing, functional genetics and pharmacological screening, we identify human gene targets and compounds that can be a starting point to develop potential pan-IAV and pan-respiratory viral HDT (Figs. 5G and 6B–K). We hope the highly collaborative approach to data-driven target identification for host-directed therapies presented here can be employed to find additional pan-viral therapies and mechanisms beyond IAV and SARS-CoV-2 for other infectious diseases.MethodsIAV-human PPI AP-MS methodsIAV strep-tagged plasmid and lentivirus constructionThe coding sequences of 12 virus proteins for A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (does not express PB1-F244,45), 13 virus proteins for A/Wyoming/03/2003 H3N2 and 13 virus proteins for A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 were cloned into a previously described pcDNA4/TO backbone vector47. IAV proteins were cloned with either an N-terminal 2X-Strep tag (PB1-F2, NA, M1, M2, NS1, NEP), C-terminal 2X-Strep tag (PB2, PB1, N40, PA, PA-X, NP) or internal 2X-Strep tag (HA). The location for 2X-Strep tag insertion was informed by previously published studies. The 2X-Strep tag was inserted internally into the HA sequence at an insertion permissive site as previously described115. The 2X-Strep tag was cloned at the C-terminus of PB1, PB2, N40, PA-X and NP based on successful published functional studies conducted with these proteins tagged at the same position116,117. For all other constructs, the 2X-Strep tag was cloned at the N-terminus, as this site was previously used to characterize the M1, M2, NS1 and NEP proteins113,118,119, and N-terminal fusions are often used to generate recombinant NA120. DNA and amino acid sequences for all 2X-Strep-tagged IAV proteins, and 2X-Strep-tagged eGFP and empty vector control proteins, are reported in Supplementary Data 1.Tagged gene sequences of all IAV proteins were first cloned from the pcDNA4/TO vector into a pLVX-TetOne-Puro doxycycline-inducible backbone vector (Takara, 631847) via Gibson Assembly. Gene inserts derived from PCR amplifications of pcDNA4/TO clones were designed with 15-30 base pairs of overlap with the backbone vector. Seven IAV proteins (PB1, PB1-F2, N40, NA, NS1, NEP, HA) had insufficient expression for AP-MS by this method. To improve protein expression, for these seven IAV proteins from all three strains, gene blocks of tagged constructs were instead codon-optimized using an online codon-optimization tool (Integrated DNA Technologies [IDT]) and synthesized (IDT), and subsequently cloned via Gibson Assembly into the pLVX-TetOne-Puro backbone vector. Gibson Assembly was performed as previously described121. Briefly, a 5X ISO Buffer was prepared with 3 mL 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 µL 2 M MgCl2, 240 µL 100 mM dNTP mix (25 mM each of dGTP, dCTP, dATP, dTTP), 300 µL 1 M DTT, 1.5 g PEG-8000, 600 µL 50 mM NAD 3x (NEB, 9007 S), and dH2O to 6 mL final volume. 5X ISO Buffer was stored at −20 °C in 320 µL aliquots. A Gibson Assembly master mix was prepared by combining 320 µL of 5X ISO Buffer with 0.64 µL 10 U/µL T5 Exonuclease (NEB, M0363S), 20 µL 2 U/µL Phusion Polymerase (NEB, M0530S), 160 µL 40 U/µL Taq DNA ligase (NEB, M0208L), and water to 1.2 mL final volume. Gibson Assembly mastermix was stored at -20 °C in 15 µL aliquots. The pLVX-TetOne-Puro backbone was linearized with restriction enzymes BamHI-HF (NEB, R3136S) and EcoRI-HF (NEB, R3101S) in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Gibson Assembly reactions were then performed by combining 20 ng of linearized backbone with the insert gene of interest in a 1:2 molar ratio in 15 µL of Gibson master mix plus water to a final volume of 20 µL. Reaction mixtures were then incubated for 30 minutes at 50 °C.pLVX-TetOne-Puro PA-X-encoding constructs were additionally cloned to include a D108A point mutation in the catalytic RNA endonuclease domain of PA-X. Catalytic IAV PA-X caused cell toxicity; therefore, we cloned a D108A substitution previously shown to inactivate endonuclease activity122,123. Briefly, D108A mutagenesis was performed by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent, 200518) on pLVX-TetOne-Puro PA-X constructs following manufacturer’s protocol adapted with Velocity enzyme (BioLine, BIO-21099) under the following conditions in a Bio-Rad C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler: 98 °C for 30 seconds - 2 minutes, 18 cycles of 98 °C for 30 seconds followed by 55 °C for 1 minute and 72 °C for 5-10 minutes, and final extension at 72 °C for 3 minutes. pLVX pH1N1 PA-X D108A 2X-Strep and pLVX H5N1 PA-X D108A 2X-Strep were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis alone. H3N2 PA-X D108A 2X-Strep was subjected to mutagenesis as described above, amplified by PCR with Phusion enzyme (NEB, M0530L), and cloned into empty pLVX-TetOne-Puro vector by InFusion cloning (Takara, 638911) following manufacturer recommendations.Stable IAV protein-expressing cell line generation and cultureA549 cells (ATCC, CCL-185) were cultured in T175 flasks (Fisher, 12-556-011) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM with L-glutamine without sodium pyruvate (Fisher, MT 10-017-CV), 10% FBS (Life Technologies, A3160502) and 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep) (Fisher, MT 30-002-CI). NHBE cells (Lonza, CC-2541) were cultured in collagen I-coated T175 flasks (Fisher, 356487) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Bronchial Epithelial Basal Medium (BEBM) (Lonza, CC-3171) with nine supplemental singlequots from the Bronchial Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (BEGM) kit (Lonza, CC-4175). THP-1 cells (ATCC, TIB-202) were cultured in T175 flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 with L-glutamine (Fisher, MT10040CV) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES (Fisher, SH3023701), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Fisher, MT 25-000-CI) and 1X Pen/Strep.For transduction of A549 and NHBE, cells were seeded in appropriate growth media at 5 × 105 cells per T75 flask (A549) or approximately 2 million cells per collagen I-coated T175 flask (NHBE), transduced with 250–500 µL lentivirus containing the IAV transgene of interest, and returned to incubate at 37 °C for 48 hours. Media was subsequently removed and replaced with appropriate cell growth media supplemented with 1 µg/mL puromycin (A549) or 0.5 µg/mL puromycin (NHBE) for transgene selection. Cells were expanded in selection media as polyclonal pools for four days (A549) or 48 hours (NHBE), to nearly 100% confluence. Cells were then split 1:6 and seeded in six replicates in selection media, equating to about 2 million cells per 15 cm dish (A549) (Fisher, 430599) or collagen I-coated 15 cm dish (NHBE) (Fisher, 08-774-9), and allowed to incubate for further expansion and transgene expression. Transgene expression was induced at three days (A549) and five days (NHBE) after seeding cells into 15 cm format.For transduction of THP-1, cells were seeded in 2 mL appropriate growth media at 1 million cells per well in a 6-well plate (Fisher, 08-772-1B). Cells were transfected in 6-well plate format with 25 µL lentivirus containing the IAV transgene of interest and returned to incubate at 37 °C for 48 hours. Cells containing the transgene were selected by incubation with growth media supplemented with 0.75 µg/mL puromycin for 72 hours. For subsequent monoclonal selection, cells were serially diluted to 150 cells/mL in growth media supplemented with 0.25 µg/mL puromycin, diluted again 1:40 in selection media and plated into 96-well flat-bottom plates (Fisher, 08-772-2 C). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3-4 weeks in selection media to allow single cell colony outgrowth. 12 colonies per transgene were selected, expanded for roughly 12 days in selection media into 24-well plates, and screened for inducible, sufficient transgene expression by doxycycline treatment (below) followed by immunoblot. Four successful monoclonal isolates per transgene were expanded in selection media into T175 flasks to a density of 1 × 106 cells/mL in a final volume of 100 mL. Following monoclonal expansion, cells were differentiated into a macrophage-like state with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Fisher, BP685-1). Briefly, 25 million THP-1 cells from each of the four monoclonal pools were plated in growth media supplemented with 0.25 µg/mL puromycin and 30 nM PMA in four 15 cm dishes, two dishes per replicate. THP-1 cells were PMA-differentiated for 48 hours before transgene expression was induced. Each monoclonal isolate serves as a replicate for THP-1.To induce transgene (IAV protein) expression in A549, NHBE and THP-1, cells were treated with doxycycline (Fisher, AAJ6057914) at final concentration 2 µg/mL for a total of 24 hours. 12 hours after doxycycline treatment, one set of replicates was treated with universal type I interferon (PBL Assay Science, 11200-2) at final concentration 1000 U/mL for 12 hours to stimulate an antiviral-like state, and one set of replicates remained untreated. There were few discernible differences in observed PPIs between treated and untreated replicate sets, therefore replicate sets were combined totaling six biological replicates (A549 and NHBE) or eight biological replicates (THP-1) to increase statistical power. To achieve sufficiently high protein levels of PB1-F2 in all cell types, PB1-F2-expressing cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Sigma-Aldrich, 474790) at final concentration 5 µM at 12 hours after doxycycline treatment for 12 hours before harvest and affinity purification.PPI sample harvest and affinity purificationTo harvest 2X-Strep-tagged IAV protein- and control-expressing A549 and NHBE cells, cells were washed in 10 mL 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Fisher, MT21031CV) and detached from plates by cell scraper (Fisher, 50-809-263) in 10 mL 1X PBS followed by a 4 mL wash for a 14 mL final cell suspension per replicate. THP-1 cells were washed in 10 mL 1X PBS and detached by cell scraper in 10 mL 1X PBS, and two dishes per replicate were combined. Each dish was then washed with an additional 5 mL per plate for a final combined 30 mL cell suspension per replicate. Cells were pelleted at 2000 rpm, 4 °C for 5 minutes, supernatant was aspirated, and pellets were resuspended in 1 mL cold lysis buffer (Immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer pH 7.4 at 4 °C (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (Fisher, MT-46034CI)) supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P40 substitute (NP40) (United States Biological, 9036-19-5), cOmplete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche, 11836153001) and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor (Roche, 04906837001)). Samples were transferred to 1.5 mL epitubes (Fisher, 05-408-129) and rotated at 4 °C for 30 minutes. Samples were subsequently frozen at −80 °C for a minimum of 30 minutes, or until affinity purification.Affinity purification was performed against the 2X-Strep tag with 50% suspension Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads (IBA, 2-1201-010). 20 µL bead volume (40 µL 50% slurry) per sample was washed in IP buffer pH 7.4 at 4 °C, pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspended in 640 µL cold IP buffer per sample (total 660 µL bead suspension). 660 µL bead suspension was then transferred to one 2 mL dolphin tube per sample (VWR, 53550-148). During this time, samples were thawed at room temperature for 20-30 minutes, and clarified by centrifugation at 3500 × g, 4 °C for 20 minutes to pellet debris. 50 μl lysate (input) was reserved for immunoblotting. 950 µL remaining lysate per sample was transferred to the corresponding 2 mL dolphin tube containing Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads and incubated for 4 hours at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were subsequently pelleted at 2000 rpm, 4 °C for 4 minutes, and washed twice in 1 mL cold wash buffer (IP buffer pH 7.4 at 4 °C with 0.05% NP40) and twice in 1 mL cold IP buffer (no NP40) by inverting 15 times and pelleting again 2000 rpm, 4 °C for 4 minutes. After the final wash, beads were resuspended in 450 µL cold IP buffer, transferred to lo-bind 0.6 mL epitubes (Axygen, MCT-060-L-C) with wide-orifice tips (Rainin, 17007099) and pelleted at 2000 rpm, 4 °C for 4 minutes. Supernatant was aspirated by 1 mL syringe (BD Biosciences, 309628) and 27-G needle (BD Biosciences, 309659), and beads were immediately processed for on-bead digestion.ImmunoblottingTo verify transgene expression in THP-1 monoclonal isolates, 500 µL suspensions of doxycycline-induced cells from a 24-well plate were transferred to 1.5 mL epitubes and pelleted at 8000 rpm for 2 minutes. Supernatant was removed, and cells were washed with 500 µL 1X PBS, pelleted again and resuspended in 100 µL 2.5X reducing sample buffer (31.2 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.83% beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.0126% bromophenol blue). Cell samples were vortexed, boiled at 98 °C for 30 minutes, vortexed again and cooled to room temperature before storage at −20 °C. Verification of transgene expression in A549 and NHBE cells was done at the time of affinity purification. To prepare affinity purification samples for immunoblot, 50 µL input was combined with 50 µL 2.5X reducing sample buffer, vortexed, boiled at 98 °C for 30 minutes, vortexed again and cooled to room temperature before storage at −20 °C.For immunoblotting, samples were thawed at room temperature, and 10 µL was loaded into each well of a 26-well 4–20% Criterion™ TGX™ Gel (Bio-Rad, 567-1094). Gels were run at 90 volts for 30 minutes followed by 150 volts for 50 minutes. The samples were then transferred at 0.25 amps for 1 hour to a PVDF Membrane (Bio-Rad, 1620177). Following protein transfer, membranes were blocked in 4% milk in PBST for 1 hour at room temperature, and then incubated with 1:1000 mouse anti-STREP (Qiagen, 34850) or 1:5000 mouse anti-GAPDH (GAPDH-71.1) (Sigma, G8795) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times in PBST for 5 minutes each, and then incubated with 1:5000 goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody (Bio-Rad, 170-6516) for 1 hour at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times and stained with Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (ThermoFisher, 32106). Exposures of the blots were taken with autoradiography film (Thomas Scientific, XC59X), and developed with a medical film processor (Konica Minolta Medical & Graphic, SRX-101A). Film was scanned at 300 pixels/inch (Epson Perfection V550 Photo) and stored as 8 bit grayscale TIFF files. Immunoblotting was performed separately for each IAV protein in each cell type as samples were generated; however, homologous IAV proteins from all three strains within one cell type were processed concurrently. TIFF files from all IAV proteins and all cell types were collated for publication (Supplementary Fig. 3), with the following modifications: brightness via the levels adjustment tool in Photoshop applied equally across each independent film scan to normalize background across different film, and image scaling and perspective editing via the perspective warp tool in Photoshop to horizontally align samples.On-bead digestion and peptide desaltingBead-bound proteins were reduced and alkylated by incubation in one bead volume equivalent of reduction/alkylation buffer (2 M urea, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM Dithiothreitol [DTT] (Sigma, D5545), 3 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma, I1149) in HPLC-grade water (Fisher Chemical, W7-4)) for 45 minutes in the dark with gentle agitation to ensure bead suspension. Iodoacetamide was quenched with an additional 3 mM DTT. Bead-bound proteins were then digested by incubation with 750 ng sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, V5111) per 10 µL bead volume, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Resulting in-solution peptides were extracted from beads by gel-loading tips (Fisher, 02-707-81) into a fresh 0.6 mL lo-bind epitube for each sample and acidified by addition of HPLC-grade formic acid (FA) (Fisher Chemical, A117-50) to final concentration 1%.Acidified peptides were desalted for MS analysis using HPLC-grade reagents and OMIX C18 10 µL tips (Agilent Technologies, A5700310K) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, OMIX tips were conditioned with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA and equilibrated with two washes of 0.1% FA. Peptides were bound to C18 zip-tip by repeated rinsing. Polymer-bound peptides were washed three times with 0.1% FA and eluted in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA. A second elution in 90% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA was performed to increase peptide recovery. Peptides were dried by speedvac vacuum centrifugation (CentriVap Concentrator with CentriVap Cold Trap, Labconco) and stored at −20 °C until MS analysis.PPI MS data acquisition and analysisDigested, desalted and dried peptides were dissolved in 12 µL 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA. 2 µL of each sample were injected in technical singlet for LC-MS/MS analysis onto an Easy-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced with an Orbitrap Elite Hybrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, peptides were separated on a 75 μm x 25 cm fused silica IntegraFrit capillary packed with 1.9 μm Reprosil-Pur C18 AQ reversed-phase resin (Dr. Maisch GMBH, r119.aq) over a 120-minute gradient at a flow rate of 300 nL/minute as described in Supplementary Data 6. Buffer A consisted of 0.1% FA in water, and buffer B was 0.1% FA in acetonitrile. For each cycle, one full MS scan in the Orbitrap (150–1500 m/z, at 120,000 resolution with an AGC target of 1 × 106 and maximum injection time of 100 milliseconds) was followed by 20 data-dependent MS/MS scans acquired in the linear ion trap (AGC target 3 × 104, maximum injection time of 50 milliseconds, fragmented by normalized collision energy at 35%). Target ions already acquired in MS/MS scans were dynamically excluded for 20 seconds (tolerance of 10 ppm). Detailed MS acquisition parameters are reported in Supplementary Data 6.Raw MS files from IAV proteins from all strains and control protein samples were grouped separately by cell line and searched simultaneously within each group using MaxQuant (version 1.6.2.10)46. 6 replicates were searched for each IAV protein and control protein in A549 and NHBE MaxQuant groups; 7–8 replicates were searched for each IAV protein and control protein in THP-1 MaxQuant group. MS/MS spectra were searched against the human proteome (SwissProt human canonical sequences, downloaded 09 October 2018), IAV protein sequences and the eGFP sequence. Trypsin (KR | P) was selected to allow up to two missed cleavages. Variable modifications were assigned for: methionine oxidation and N-terminal protein acetylation. One static modification was assigned for carbamidomethyl cysteine. Label free quantitation (LFQ) was enabled. All other MaxQuant settings were left at the default.MaxQuant-analyzed data were then scored using the MiST algorithm47 that assigns quantitative interaction confidence scores based on specificity, abundance and reproducibility, following previous guidelines124 using spectral counts as the quantifying feature. To enable robust scoring, we excluded samples with low spectral counts and low or no IAV protein identification, and those with less than two replicates. Following these quality control filtering steps, 590 samples across 14 baits (12 IAV proteins and 2 control proteins) remained for analysis. We ran the MiST algorithm applying a weight set of specificity S = 50%, reproducibility R = 45% and abundance A = 5%. To identify high-confidence PPIs, we applied a set of stringent scoring criteria: (1) MiST score > 0.6; (2) the interaction is absent in eGFP and empty-vector control samples; and (3) at least 4/6 replicates have a spectral count > 0. IAV M2 protein in A549 cells and IAV NP protein in NHBE cells retained a disproportionately large number of interactions, therefore we applied more stringent scoring criteria to these two specific samples: (1) MiST score > 0.75; (2) the interaction is absent in eGFP and empty-vector control samples; (3) at least 5/6 replicates have a spectral count > 0; and (4) average spectral count > 3. Interactions that fall above these cutoffs represent the final high-confidence PPI list, and contain a total of 126 interactions in A549 (top 4% of interactions), 130 interactions in NHBE (top 9% of interactions), and 76 interactions in THP-1 (top 5% of interactions) (Supplementary Data 1). This list was used for further bioinformatic analyses and validation.Validation of IAV-human PPIs M2-ATP6V1A and NEP-AHNAK in IAV-infected cellsVirusesIAV isolate A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 HALo was rescued by reverse genetics from available sequences and engineered to contain a deletion in the HA polybasic cleavage site125, allowing its use in Biosafety Level 2+ facilities. All IAV viruses were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories) following methods previously described126. Virus stocks were titrated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC, CCL-34) by plaque assay. All IAV infections were performed according to institutional Biosafety Level 2+ biosafety procedures at the J. David Gladstone Institutes.Cell infections and harvest for reciprocal IPs, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence (IF)For reciprocal IPs, A549 and NHBE cells were cultured as described above (IAV-Human PPI AP-MS Methods). One 15 cm dish was seeded for each IP from both mock and H5N1 infection conditions in A549 cells (ATP6V1A or IgG baits) or NHBE cells (AHNAK or IgG1 baits). A549 cells were seeded at 5 × 106 million cells per 15 cm tissue culture dish (Thermo Fisher, 130183), cultured in DMEM media with 10% FBS and 1X Pen/Strep, and expanded to roughly 2 × 107 cells at time of infection. NHBE cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells per collagen I-coated 15 cm dish (Corning, 354551), cultured in BEBM media with nine BEGM supplemental singlequots, and expanded to 7 × 106 cells at time of infection. For IAV infections, cell growth media was removed, and A549 or NHBE cells were infected with A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 HALo at MOI 0.5 in 10 mL 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (GoldBio, A-420-100) in 1X PBS per plate, or mock-infected with 10 mL 0.5% BSA in 1X PBS per plate. Cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and rocked by hand every 10 minutes, after which inoculum was removed and replaced with 25 mL DMEM with 0.1% FBS, 0.3% BSA and 0.5 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, T8802) per plate (A549 cells) or 27 mL BEBM growth media with 0.25 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin per plate (NHBE cells). Cells were returned to incubate at 37 °C and harvested at 24 hours post-infection. Briefly, media was removed, and cells were detached from plates by cell scraper in 10 mL cold 1X PBS and collected in 15 mL Falcon tubes (Fisher, 14-959-53 A). Cells were pelleted at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 °C (A549 cells), or 400 × g for 3 minutes at 4 °C (NHBE cells). The supernatant was removed, and pellets were stored on ice. 10 mL cold 1X PBS was added to the original 15 cm plates for a second cell scraping, collected and used to resuspend and wash existing cell pellets. 100 μL aliquots were removed and combined with 100 μL 2% formaldehyde (Sigma, F8775-500ML) in 1X PBS in a 96-well U-bottom plate (Fisher 08-772-17) for flow cytometry. Cells were pelleted again as described above, washed a second time in 10 mL cold 1X PBS, and pelleted again, after which supernatant was removed. Cell pellets were frozen at −80 °C overnight, and subsequently thawed on ice in 1 mL cold lysis buffer (recipe described above in IAV-Human PPI AP-MS Methods). Samples were transferred to lo-bind 1.5 mL epitubes (Fisher, 022431081) and rotated end-over-end at 4 °C for 30 minutes. Samples were subsequently frozen at −80 °C overnight until reciprocal IP.For IF, NHBE cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells per well in collagen I-coated 24-well plates (Corning, 354408) and cultured as described above in BEBM media with nine BEGM supplemental singlequots. For IAV and mock infections, cell growth media was removed and replaced with 400 μL per well A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 HALo at MOI 0.5 in 0.5% BSA in 1X PBS, or 400 μL per well 0.5% BSA in 1X PBS. Cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and rocked by hand every 10 minutes. After virus adsorption, inoculum was removed and replaced with 400 μL per well BEBM growth media with 0.25 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin. At 24 hours post-infection, media was removed, and cells were washed in 300 μL 1X PBS and fixed to the collagen I-coated 24-well plate in 300 μL 4% formaldehyde in 1X PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature. Fixative was removed, cells were washed again in 300 μL 1X PBS and then permeabilized with 300 μL 0.1% TritonX (Sigma, T8787) in 1X PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature. TritonX solution was removed, and the fixed, permeabilized cells were stored in 1 mL 1X PBS at 4 °C, with the plate sealed by parafilm and wrapped in aluminum foil, until IF.Reciprocal IPs against ATP6V1A and AHNAKCell lysates were thawed on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 20 minutes at 4 °C. 50 μL of clarified lysate was reserved as input aliquots for each sample and subjected to Bradford assay for total protein quantification and targeted MS analysis for endogenous protein and IAV protein quantification. Total protein in each sample was quantified by Bradford Reagent (Sigma, B6916) following manufacturer instructions on a SpectraMax iD3 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) with acquisition at 595 nm using manufacturer software SoftMax Pro (version 7.1) (Molecular Devices). For targeted MS analysis, roughly 25–50 μg protein from the input samples was reduced in 4 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (Thermo Fisher, 20491) for 20 minutes at room temperature, alkylated in 10 mM iodoacetamide for 20 minutes at room temperature in the dark, and quenched in 10 mM DTT at room temperature for 5 minutes. Reduced and alkylated input samples were then subjected to methanol chloroform precipitation. Briefly, 1 part sample was combined and vortexed sequentially with 4 parts methanol, 1 part chloroform and 3 parts water for phase separation. Samples were spun in a bench-top centrifuge (Centrifuge 5424 R, Eppendorf) for 2 minutes at 14,000 × g, after which the upper phase was discarded. 4 parts methanol was added and vortexed with the interphase and lower phase, samples were centrifuged for 8 minutes at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was discarded. The protein pellet was washed three times in 1 mL 80% ice cold acetone with centrifugation for 8 minutes at 14,000 × g after each wash. Precipitated proteins were air dried, resuspended in 8 M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in HPLC-grade water, diluted 5-fold in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in HPLC-grade water, and digested with sequencing-grade trypsin at a 1:100 (enzyme:protein w-w) ratio overnight at 37 °C in a thermomixer (Thermomixer C, Eppendorf) at 500 rpm. After digestion, peptides were acidified by addition of HPLC-grade FA to final concentration 1% before desalting.For endogenous IPs, 950 μL-1 mL of clarified lysate (roughly 0.8–1.6 mg total protein) from A549 cells was combined with 1:100 (antibody:lysate v-v) anti-ATP6V1A rabbit monoclonal (EPR19270) antibody (Abcam, ab199326) or 1:200 (antibody:lysate v-v) rabbit IgG control antibody (Proteintech, 501003118) in a 1.5 mL lo-bind epitube. 950 μL-1 mL of clarified lysate (roughly 0.3-0.5 mg total protein) from NHBE cells was combined with 1:100 (antibody:lysate v-v) anti-AHNAK mouse monoclonal (EM-09) antibody (Thermo Fisher, MA1-10050) or 1:200 (antibody:lysate v-v) mouse IgG1 isotype control (MOPC-21) antibody (Thermo Fisher, MA1-10407) in a 1.5 mL lo-bind epitube. Lysate-primary antibody mixtures were incubated for 16 hours at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Purification was performed with 50 μL per sample Pierce Protein A + G magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher, 88802). Beads were washed four times with 1 mL cold lysis buffer (recipe described above in IAV-Human PPI AP-MS Methods) by repeated bead binding to a DynaMag-2 magnetic tube rack (Thermo Fisher, 12321D) for 1-2 minutes, removing supernatant, and resuspending beads thoroughly using wide orifice tips. 50 μL washed beads were incubated with the lysate-primary antibody mixture for 2 hours at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Samples were then briefly spun down and washed two times in 1 mL cold wash buffer (IP buffer pH 7.4 at 4 °C with 0.05% NP40) and two times in 1 mL cold IP buffer (no NP40) by repeated bead binding to a DynaMag-2 magnetic tube rack described above. On-bead reduction, alkylation and digestion with sequencing-grade trypsin was performed as described above (IAV-Human PPI AP-MS Methods). Resulting digested, in-solution peptides were extracted from the beads and acidified by addition of HPLC-grade FA to final concentration 1% before desalting, as described above (IAV-Human PPI AP-MS Methods).For all input and reciprocal IP samples, peptides were desalted by OMIX C18 100 μL tips (Agilent, A57003100K) and dried down by vacuum centrifugation as described above (IAV-Human PPI AP-MS Methods). Digested, desalted and dried peptides were resuspended in 10 μL (input samples) or 12 μL (IP samples) of 3% acetonitrile, 2% FA for targeted MS acquisition.Targeted MS data acquisition and analysisTargeted MS relied on first queuing data-dependent acquisition (DDA) runs on all reciprocal IP samples to select peptides for parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) acquisition and analysis. PRM was subsequently performed for all input and reciprocal IP samples. DDA data and PRM data were acquired on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced with an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Detailed PRM LC and MS acquisition parameters are reported in Supplementary Data 6.For DDA-based acquisition, 1 μL of each reciprocal IP sample (A549 cells) or 2 μL of each reciprocal IP sample (NHBE cells) was separated on a PepSep C18 column (15 cm × 150 μm, 1.9 μm particle size) (Bruker, 1893471) over the course of a 60-minute data acquisition. Buffer A consisted of 0.1% FA in water, and buffer B was 0.1% FA in 80% acetonitrile. Spectra were acquired continuously in a data-dependent manner. One full scan in the Orbitrap (at 240,000 resolution in profile mode with an AGC target of 1 × 106 and maximum injection time of 50 milliseconds) was followed by as many MS/MS scans as could be acquired on the N most abundant ions in 1 second in the ion trap (rapid scan type, HCD collision energy of 32%, AGC target of 3 × 104, maximum injection time of 18 milliseconds). Singly and unassigned charge states were rejected. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a repeat count of 2, an exclusion duration of 20 seconds, and an exclusion mass width of ±10 ppm. Raw files were searched using MaxQuant (version 1.6.3.3)46 in two search groups: (1) ATP6V1A and IgG baits from mock-infected and H5N1-infected A549 cells; and (2) AHNAK and IgG1 baits from mock-infected and H5N1-infected NHBE cells. MS/MS spectra were searched against the human proteome (SwissProt human canonical sequences, downloaded 09 October 2018), IAV protein sequences and the eGFP sequence. Trypsin (KR | P) was selected to allow up to two missed cleavages. Variable modifications were assigned for: methionine oxidation and N-terminal protein acetylation. One static modification was assigned for carbamidomethyl cysteine. Label free quantitation (LFQ) was enabled. All other MaxQuant settings were left at default. The msms.txt results from the DDA-based MaxQuant searches were then imported into Skyline127 (version 21.2.0.536 dbaf6ccd2) to select peptides for PRM acquisition and analysis. In the ATP6V1A purification experiment, 8 peptides for ATP6V1A and 2 peptides for M2 were employed. In the AHNAK purification experiment, 6 peptides from AHNAK and 3 peptides from NEP were utilized.For PRM-based acquisition, 1 μL of each ATP6V1A or IgG reciprocal IP sample (A549 cells), 2 μL of each AHNAK or IgG1 reciprocal IP sample (NHBE cells), or 1 μL of each input sample (NHBE and A549 cells) were separated on the same PepSep column described above using a similar gradient to the bait-matched DDA runs over a 60-minute data acquisition (Supplementary Data 6). The acquisition was performed in parallel reaction monitoring mode, using a time-window scheduling of 4 minutes per peptide, 0.9 m/z isolation window, 60,000 resolution (400 m/z), HCD peptide fragmentation (normalized collision energy of 33%), and AGC target of 1 × 107. The injection time was set to “dynamic”, with 9 points per peak as the target number of points. Detailed MS acquisition parameters are reported in Supplementary Data 6.Following PRM acquisition, PRM data was extracted in Skyline127 (version 21.2.0.536 dbaf6ccd2) with the following settings: MS/MS filtering was set to targeted using Orbitrap as the mass analyzer (60,000 resolution, high selectivity extraction), and MS1 filtering was disabled. A minimum of 6 and a maximum of 30 transitions from the library were allowed. After manual peak integration and removal of interfering transitions, the quantification per fragment was exported. Fragments having m/z < precursors or signal/background ratio less than 5 were removed to ensure robust quantitative accuracy. The transitions per peptides were summed and then the average across all peptides for a specific protein were used for quantification. For fold change calculations, the data was log2-transformed and the ratio of the IgG H5N1-infected A549 cell sample, or IgG1 H5N1-infected NHBE cell sample, was used to derive M2 enrichment from ATP6V1A-bait samples, or NEP enrichment from AHNAK-bait samples, respectively (Supplementary Data 1).IAV infection staining and flow cytometryWhole, intact A549 or NHBE cells harvested and reserved from the 15 cm reciprocal IP plates were immunostained for IAV NP protein and quantified by flow cytometry to determine percent cells infected with IAV. To remove and exchange buffers between incubations and washes, cells were pelleted in 96-well U-bottom plates at 800 × g for 3 minutes. Fixed cells were pelleted and incubated in 100 μL block and permeabilization buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% saponin (Sigma, 47036-50G-F) in 1X PBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were pelleted and incubated with 100 μL 1:1000 mouse anti-Influenza A nucleoprotein [HT103] antibody (Kerafast, EMS010) in block and permeabilization buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were pelleted, washed once with 200 μL wash buffer (1% BSA in 1X PBS) and incubated in 100 μL 1:1000 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) Alexa Fluor Plus 488 (Fisher, A32723) in block and permeabilization buffer for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. Cells were washed twice with 200 μL wash buffer and fixed in 150 μL 1% formaldehyde in 1X PBS. Samples were run in 96-well format on an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher) with accompanying Attune NxT Software (version 3.2.0). Voltages were set at: (1) forward scatter 80 and side scatter voltage at 275 (R1, A549 singlet cells); and (2) forward scatter 120 and side scatter 280 (NHBE cells). In both experiments, Alexa Fluor Plus 488 signal was quantified by blue laser 1 at voltage 205 (percent NP + ). 100 μL of cells were acquisitioned and all events recorded at 1000 μL/min. Final cell gating and quantification of %NP+ cells (percent IAV infectivity) was performed with FlowJo software (version 10.7.1). %NP+ cells (percent IAV infection) are reported in technical singlet (Supplementary Fig. 5B,D).IF staining against AHNAK and IAV NEP and microscopyFixed, permeabilized cells in 24-well plate format were blocked in 300 μL 1% BSA in 1X PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature with gentle rocking, and then incubated in 300 μL 1:500 anti-AHNAK mouse monoclonal (EM-09) (Thermo Fisher, MA1-10050) and 1:500 anti-influenza A NS2 (NEP) rabbit polyclonal (Thermo Fisher, PA5-32234) primary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA in 1X PBS at 4 °C overnight with gentle rocking. The next day, cells were washed three times in 1X PBS for 5 minutes each wash with gentle rocking, and then incubated in 300 μL 1:1000 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher, A32727) and 1:1000 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher, A32733) secondary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA in 1X PBS for 1 hour at room temperature, with the plate wrapped in aluminum foil to protect against light exposure and gentle rocking. Cells were then washed three times as previously described with the plate wrapped in aluminum foil. Cells were finally stained in 300 μL 1:2000 Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (Invitrogen, H3570) for 30 minutes at room temperature, with the plate wrapped in aluminum foil and gentle rocking. Cells were washed three times as previously described with the plate wrapped in aluminum foil, and suspended in 300 μL 1X PBS. The stained 24-well plate was sealed by parafilm and stored at 4 °C wrapped in aluminum foil until microscopy.For microscopy, cells were imaged directly in multi-well format in the 24-well collagen I-coated plate in which they were cultured, infected, fixed and stained. Images were acquired using MetaXpress 6 software on an ImageXpress Micro Confocal High-Content Screening System (Molecular Devices) using the included 10X Plan Apo 0.45 NA objective and 60 μm pinhole spinning disk. Image overlays and montages were formatted with Molecular Devices MetaXpress Imaging and Analysis software suite (version 6.7.2.290). Additional formatting of scale bars and figure panels was performed in Adobe Photoshop (version 23.0.2) and Illustrator (version 26.0.1), respectively.Global abundance and phosphorylation profiling methodsVirusesIAV isolates A/California/04/2009 H1N1 and A/Wyoming/03/2003 H3N2 were obtained through BEI Resources (NIAID, NIH). A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 HALo was generated as described above (Validation of IAV-Human PPIs M2-ATP6V1A and NEP-AHNAK in IAV-Infected Cells Methods). All IAV viruses were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories) following methods previously described126. Virus stocks were titrated in MDCK cells by plaque assay. All infections with live IAV were performed in accordance with institutional Biosafety Level 2+ biosafety procedures at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the J. David Gladstone Institutes.Cell infections for global proteomic analysisNHBE cells were seeded at 1 × 107 cells per collagen I-coated 15 cm dish and cultured in BEBM media with nine BEGM supplemental singlequots (described above). THP-1 cells were expanded in suspension in T75 flasks at a density of 2 × 105–8 × 105 cells/mL and cultured in RPMI-1640 with L-glutamine supplemented with 10% FBS, gentamicin (Thermo Scientific, 15750060) at final concentration 50 µg/mL and 1X Pen/Strep. For plating, THP-1 cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 minutes, resuspended in growth media supplemented with PMA at final concentration 10 ng/mL to induce differentiation, and subsequently seeded at 2 × 107 cells per 15 cm dish. THP-1 cells were differentiated for 72 hours in PMA media, before media was exchanged with growth media (no PMA) for 24 hours to reduce PMA-activated pro-inflammatory response. For infection, cell growth media was removed, and cells were either mock infected or infected in biological duplicate with A/California/04/2009 H1N1 IAV, A/Wyoming/03/2003 H3N2 IAV or A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 HALo IAV at MOI 2 in 0.5% BSA in 1X PBS with magnesium and calcium. Cells were incubated in virus inoculum at 37 °C for 1 hour. After adsorption, virus inoculum was aspirated and replaced with cell growth media supplemented with TPCK-trypsin. Cells were returned to incubate at 37 °C before cell harvest and global proteomics sample preparation and processing.Global proteomics sample preparationIAV-infected cells were harvested and lysed at 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours and 18 hours post-infection in biological duplicate with time point-matched mocks for each IAV strain. At the indicated time point, cells were washed with 1X PBS and lysed in 2 mL urea lysis buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with cOmplete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer by cell scraper, collected in 15 mL Falcon tubes and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Samples were subsequently snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until probe sonication. Samples were thawed on ice and subjected to three rounds of probe sonication (Fisherbrand™ Model 505 Sonic Dismembrator) at 20% amplitude for 20 seconds followed by 10 seconds of rest on ice. Protein concentration was then determined by Bradford assay. Protein from clarified lysate was reduced with 4 mM TCEP for 30 minutes at room temperature, and alkylated with iodoacetamide at final concentration 10 mM for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Iodoacetamide was quenched by addition of final concentration 10 mM DTT and incubation in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes. For digestion, samples were diluted with 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 2 M urea. Sequencing-grade trypsin was added at a 1:100 (enzyme:protein w-w) ratio and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Following digestion, 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to acidify each sample to a final pH ~2. Samples were desalted by vacuum manifold (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Sep Pak tC18 cartridges (Waters, WAT054955) and HPLC-grade reagents. Each cartridge was activated with 1 mL 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA, and equilibrated three times with 1 mL 0.1% TFA. Samples were loaded onto C18 cartridges, and peptide-bound cartridges were washed four times with 1 mL 0.1% TFA. Samples were then eluted four times with 0.5 mL 50% acetonitrile, 0.25% FA to maximize peptide recovery. 10 μg of each sample was reserved for global protein abundance MS data acquisition, and the remainder (at least 1 mg) was allocated to phosphopeptide enrichment. All samples were dried by speedvac vacuum centrifugation (CentriVap Concentrator with CentriVap Cold Trap, Labconco).Phosphopeptide enrichmentFor phosphopeptide enrichment, iron nitriloacetic acid (NTA) agarose resin was prepared in-house from 50% nickel NTA (Ni-NTA) Superflow bead slurry (Qiagen, 30210). 30 μL per sample of 50% Ni-NTA Superflow bead slurry was added to a 2 mL bio-spin column (Bio-Rad, 732-6204). Beads were stripped of nickel ions by four 30-second incubations with 500 μL 100 mM EDTA. Beads were conditioned and loaded with iron by two washes with 500 μL H2O, four 1-minute incubations with 500 μL 100 mM FeCl3, three washes with 500 μL H2O, and one wash with 500 μL 0.5% FA to remove residual iron. Beads were resuspended in 600 μL H2O, and 60 μL was aliquoted into a C18 NEST column (Fisher, NC0484000) that was equilibrated with 150 μL of 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA. 1 mg of digested, dried peptides were resuspended in 75% acetonitrile, 0.15% TFA. Peptides were incubated with the beads for 2 minutes, mixed by pipetting and incubated again for 2 minutes. Beads were washed four times with 200 μL 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA, followed by three washes with 200 μL 0.5% FA. Beads were then incubated twice with 200 μL 500 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7 for 15 seconds, and twice with 200 μL 0.5% FA for 15 seconds. Phosphopeptides were eluted twice to maximize recovery with 75 μL 50% acetonitrile, 0.25% FA by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds, and dried by speedvac vacuum centrifugation (CentriVap Concentrator with CentriVap Cold Trap, Labconco).Global phosphorylation and abundance MS data acquisition and analysisGlobal AB and PH MS samples were collected on three instruments following instrument-specific LC and MS acquisition parameters (Supplementary Data 6). Samples acquired on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) include: (1) NHBE AB data for pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1; (2) NHBE PH data for pH1N1 and H3N2; and (3) THP-1 AB data for pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1. Samples acquired on an Orbitrap Elite Hybrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) include: NHBE PH data for H5N1. Samples acquired on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) include: THP-1 PH data for pH1N1, H3N2 and H5N1.For samples acquired on the Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid, digested, desalted and dried peptides were resuspended in 10 μL 0.1% TFA (AB samples) or 15 μL of 0.1% TFA (PH samples). 2 μL of each sample were injected in technical duplicate (samples from NHBE cells) or technical singlet (samples from THP-1 cells) on an Easy-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced with an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, peptides were separated on a 75 μm × 25 cm fused silica IntegraFrit capillary packed with 1.9 μm Reprosil-Pur C18 AQ reversed-phase resin (Dr. Maisch GMBH, r119.aq) over a 180-minute gradient at a flow rate of 300 nL/minute as described in Supplementary Data 6. Buffer A consisted of 0.1% FA in water, and buffer B was 0.1% FA in acetonitrile. Spectra were continuously acquired in a data-dependent manner. One full scan in the Orbitrap (400-1600 m/z at 120,000 resolution with an AGC target of 2 × 105 and maximum injection time of 100 milliseconds) was followed by as many MS/MS scans as could be acquired on the most abundant ions in 3 seconds in the dual linear ion trap (HCD collision energy of 30%, AGC target of 1 × 104, maximum injection time of 35 milliseconds, and isolation window of 1.6 m/z). Singly and unassigned charge states were rejected. Dynamic exclusion was enabled after n = 1 time, with an exclusion duration of 40 seconds (tolerance of ±10 ppm). Detailed MS acquisition parameters are reported in Supplementary Data 6.For samples acquired on an Orbitrap Elite Hybrid Mass Spectrometer, digested, desalted and dried peptides were resuspended in 10 μL 0.1% TFA (AB samples) or 15 μL of 0.1% TFA (PH samples). 2 μL of each sample were injected in technical duplicate on an Easy-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced with a Orbitrap Elite Hybrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, peptides were separated on a 75 μm × 25 cm fused silica IntegraFrit capillary packed with 1.9 μm Reprosil-Pur C18 AQ reversed-phase resin (Dr. Maisch GMBH, r119.aq) over a 240-minute gradient at a flow rate of 300 nL/minute as described in Supplementary Data 6. Buffer A consisted of 0.1% FA in water, and buffer B was 0.1% FA in acetonitrile. Spectra were continuously acquired in a data-dependent manner. For each cycle, one full scan in the Orbitrap (200-2000 m/z, at 120,000 resolution with an AGC target of 1 × 106 and maximum injection time of 100 milliseconds) was followed by 20 MS/MS scans acquired in the linear ion trap (AGC target of 3 × 104, maximum injection time of 50 ms, fragmented by normalized collision energy at 35%). Singly and unassigned charge states were rejected. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a repeat count of 1, an exclusion duration of 20 seconds (tolerance of ±10 ppm). Detailed MS acquisition parameters are reported in Supplementary Data 6.For samples acquired on the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid, digested, desalted and dried peptides were resuspended in 15 μL of 4% FA, 3% acetonitrile. 2 μL of each sample were injected in technical singlet onto an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced via a nanoelectrospray source (Nanospray Flex) with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, peptides were separated on a C18 reverse phase column (75 μm × 25 cm packed with 1.9 μm Reprosil-Pur C18 AQ reversed-phase resin) over the course of a 180-minute data acquisition as described in Supplementary Data 6. Buffer A consisted of 0.1% FA in water, and buffer B was 0.1% FA in acetonitrile. Spectra were continuously acquired in a data-dependent manner. One full scan in the Orbitrap (at 120,000 resolution in profile mode with an AGC target of 2 × 105 and maximum injection time of 100 milliseconds) was followed by as many MS/MS scans as could be acquired on the most abundant ions in 3 seconds in the dual linear ion trap (rapid scan type with an intensity threshold of 5000, HCD collision energy of 30%, AGC target of 1 × 104, maximum injection time of 35 milliseconds, and isolation width of 1.6 m/z). Singly and unassigned charge states were rejected. Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a repeat count of 1, an exclusion duration of 30 seconds, and an exclusion mass width of ±10 ppm. Detailed MS acquisition parameters are reported in Supplementary Data 6.Raw MS files from IAV infection time course samples were grouped separately by cell line, enrichment (abundance vs phosphorylation), and instrument, and searched simultaneously within each group using MaxQuant (version 1.6.1.0)46. MS/MS spectra were searched against the human proteome (SwissProt human canonical sequences, downloaded 09 October 2018) and IAV protein sequences. Trypsin (KR | P) was selected to allow up to two missed cleavages. Variable modifications were assigned for: N-terminal protein acetylation, N-terminal protein methionine oxidation, and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine (the latter for phosphorylation enrichment samples only). One static modification was assigned for carbamidomethyl cysteine. LFQ was enabled. Match between runs was enabled with a 1.5-minute matching time window and 20-minute alignment window. All other MaxQuant settings were left at the default.Peptide ion intensities from the output of MaxQuant were summarized to protein intensities using the R Bioconductor package MSstats (version 3.19.4)69, specifically the function dataProcess, with default settings except that the noise-filtering128 was turned on by setting featureSubset = “highQuality” and remove_uninformative_feature_outler = TRUE. For phosphopeptide data, the peptide ion intensities were similarly summarized to a single intensity per unique observed single-peptide combination of phosphorylated sites by relabeling the protein of each feature as the combination of protein name and observed phosphorylated sites. The Bioconductor package artMS (version 1.3.9) (https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.artMS) was used for this relabeling. The differences in log2-transformed intensity between infected and mock samples were scored using the MSstats function groupComparison, which fits a single linear model for each protein with a single categorical variable for condition. From these models, MSstats reports pairwise differences in means between conditions as log2 fold change (log2FC) with a p-value based on a t-test assuming equal variance across all conditions, and reports adjusted p-values using the false discovery rate (FDR) estimated by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. One single time point per virus was selected for both cell types based on high viral protein abundance in the abundance data: at 18 hours post-infection for pH1N1 and H3N2, and 12 hours post-infection for H5N1. To determine significant changes in protein abundance and phosphorylation, selection criteria included: (1) adjusted p-value < 0.05; and (2) absolute(log2FC) > 1 (Supplementary Data 2).Computational analyses methodsGene Ontology (GO) enrichmentsFor PPI GO enrichments, the human interacting proteins of each IAV protein were collated across all strains and cell types, and tested for enrichment of GO Molecular Function terms. The over-representation analysis was performed using the enrichGO function of clusterProfiler package (version 3.18.0) in R with default parameters. GO terms were obtained from the R annotation package org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.12.0). Significant GO terms were defined as those with p-value < 0.002. Terms with overlapping genes in each set were compared and the most significant term (lowest p-value) with the largest gene set size was selected as the non-redundant term. PPI enrichments were subject to further manual curation, with a maximum of the top three significant non-redundant GO terms listed and visualized for each IAV protein (Supplementary Data 1).For PH GO enrichments, proteins with significantly up- and down-regulated phosphorylation events (defined as adjusted p-value < 0.05, absolute(log2FC) > 1, and observed in infected and mock samples) of each virus strain were collated at 18 hours post-infection (pH1N1, H3N2) and at 12 hours post-infection (H5N1) across all cell types, and tested for enrichment of GO terms from among all three ontologies: Biological Process, Molecular Function and Cellular Component. The over-representation analysis was performed using the enricher function of clusterProfiler package (version 3.12.0) in R with default parameters. GO terms were obtained from the R annotation package org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.12.0). Significant terms were defined as those with adjusted p-value < 0.05. We selected a set of non-redundant terms following an automated clustering procedure. We first constructed a term tree based on distances (1-Jaccard Similarity Coefficients of shared genes in KEGG or GO) between the significant terms. The term tree was cut at a specific level (h = 0.99) to identify clusters of non-redundant gene sets. For results with multiple significant terms belonging to the same cluster, we selected the most significant term (i.e. lowest adjusted p-value) (Supplementary Data 2).Network visualizationsAll networks were generated and visualized in Cytoscape (version 3.8.2)129. For the IAV-human PPI network, IAV-human PPIs were represented by strain and collated across all cell types. In cases where one human protein is shared between two virus proteins, the maximum MiST score from either IAV protein in any cell type was reported for each IAV strain. Human-human PPIs were annotated as reported in the comprehensive resource of mammalian protein complexes (CORUM) database130. Manual annotations to the network include human-human PPI protein complex name and biological process. Briefly, human prey proteins for each IAV protein were subjected to gene set enrichment analysis using either GO Biological Process terms or CORUM protein complex annotations. Genes that were members of enriched biological processes or protein complexes were labeled in the network using Adobe Illustrator software (v24.1). Labels were manually curated to simplify and generalize terms to facilitate interpretability. Genes mapped under a GO Biological Process term were manually investigated to ensure the term represented each gene’s canonical function; genes that clearly possessed multiple functions, or genes that were otherwise difficult to classify, were excluded to reduce the appearance of misleading annotations. For the PPI-phosphorylation overlay network, proteins were selected and visualized if they were identified in the PPI data above MiST scoring thresholds and in the phosphorylation data at the restricted time points (18 hours post-infection pH1N1, H3N2; 12 hours post-infection H5N1) with an absolute(log2FC) > 1 and adjusted p-value < 0.05 in any cell type. If a site was detected across multiple cell lines, the maximum absolute value, non-infinite fold-change was used.Kinase enrichment analysisKinase activity predictions were generated on the full, non-infinite unfiltered log2FC phosphorylation data (i.e. no thresholds) using the ProtMapper resources available in OmniPath71. ProtMapper is a comprehensive catalog of kinase-substrate relationships that includes six databases (PhosphoSitePlus, SIGNOR, HPRD, NCI-PID, Reactome and the BEL Large Corpus) and three text-mining tools (REACH, Sparser and RLIMS-P). Kinase activity predictions were reported as a Z score that was calculated using the mean log2FC of phosphorylated substrates for each kinase in terms of standard error (Z = [M - u] / SE), comparing fold changes in phosphorylation site measurements of the known substrates against the overall distribution of fold changes across the sample. A p-value was also calculated by this approach using a two-tailed Z-test method, and thresholds were set at a FDR (by Benjamini-Hochberg method) <0.05. This approach has been previously shown to perform well at estimating kinase activities19,79,131,132. In our study, this approach produced annotations for 314 kinases with available data across all collected time points, virus strains and cell types (Supplementary Data 2). High-confidence kinase activity annotations were generated by: (1) limiting analysis to 18 hours post-infection (pH1N1, H3N2) and 12 hours post-infection (H5N1) in NHBE and THP-1 cell types, and (2) requiring each kinase possess two known phosphorylation sites detected in the PH dataset. This produced a high-confidence list of 13 kinases with activity predictions (Fig. 3F). Each site was represented individually or as a combination of phosphorylated sites when multiple phosphorylations were observed within single peptides. Kinase activities from SARS-CoV-2 phosphoproteomics data19 were calculated using the same approach reported in this study, and also thresholded at FDR < 0.05 (Supplementary Fig. 6D).Influenza patient cohort analysis methodsHuman subjects researchWe obtained de-identified human samples from 495 participants following written informed consent by the participants or their guardians at five eMERGE study sites (Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Marshfield, Mount Sinai, Northwestern University, and Vanderbilt). Of the 495 participants, the mean age (with standard deviation) was 39.7 (+/−25) years (range: 0 to 90). 273 participants (55.2%) were female, and all were of European descent. We considered demographic information, including sex, race, ethnicity and age of the participants, as variables in the analyses. We used genetically determined sex information. We based the diagnosis of IAV infection on established clinical criteria. Approval for human subjects research was obtained from the institutions involved, and human subjects research was conducted in compliance with all relevant ethical regulations. Study protocols were reviewed and approved by the appropriate local institutional review boards (IRB) (Northwestern University IRB IDs STU00084534, STU00078215, STU00206610 and STU00211941).Whole-exome capture and DNA sequencingExome enrichment was accomplished with the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome+UTR (Roche NimbleGen, version 2) that targets 64 Mb of coding exons and miRNA regions plus 32 Mb untranslated regions (UTRs) for solution-based capture following the manufacturer’s protocol. Library preparation was performed with 200 ng of genomic DNA using KAPA HyperPlus library kit (Roche, KK8514) using adaptors compatible with Illumina sequencer on the Hamilton STAR automated platform. We performed amplification, pooling, hybridization, washing, and elution according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We assessed the libraries for quality with a high sensitivity DNA ScreenTape assay on the 2200 TapeStation System (Agilent) and quantity with KAPA Library Quantification Kits for Illumina platforms (Kapa Biosystems). The libraries were diluted to 2 nM and clustered using an Illumina cBot with a HiSeq 3000/4000 paired-end cluster kit on a patterned flow cell and a HiSeq 3000/4000 SBS kit (300 cycles, Illumina v2.5 reagents) on the HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform.Data processingEach individual’s WES data were mapped to the human reference genome (build hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (v0.7)133. After marking duplicates using Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, v3.1)134 was used to remove duplicates, perform local realignment, and map quality score recalibration to produce a BAM file. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls were made by the HaplotypeCaller (v3.4), filtering poor calls by the Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) filter from GATK. We sorted the aligned reads based on genome position using Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) and recalibrated the base quality score using default parameters. Each sample’s final gvcf files were streamed to Illumina DRAGEN Bio-IT Platform (v3.1, Illumina), applying the default parameters in the ‘--vc-enable-gatk-acceleration true’ option to identify and remove low-quality variants. We identified 3,621,267 genetic variants from the exome sequencing data after quality control, of which 3,256,844 had MAF < 1%. We performed quality control on our samples based on the number of total variants, number of singletons, missing rate, heterozygote vs homozygote ratio, transversion vs transition ratio, race inconsistency, sample relatedness, and missing phenotype. We finally identified 495 unrelated individuals of genetically-identified European Ancestry using PCA with LD-pruned variants (r2 = 0.2) and 1000 genome project phase3 data as ref. 135.Gene-based association and phosphorylation site predictionWe classified a variant as pLOF if the variant was predicted deleterious (nonsynonymous exonic, frameshift substitution, or stop gain/loss variant; MAF < 1%) from any of the following six annotation algorithms: SIFT and SIFT 4G75, PolyPhen-2 HDIV and PolyPhen-2 HVAR76, likelihood ratio test (LRT), and Mutation Taster77. Variant annotations and pLOF were predicted by ANNOVAR using dbNSFP136. Using a gene-based collapsing method with various filters applied, we binned together the pLOF variants to identify their contributions to disease with good power. Firth logistic regression and burden tests137 were applied, adjusting for hospital, age, sex, and top 10 principal components (PCs). FDR from Benjamini & Hochberg138 < 0.05 was applied to identify genes as significant (Supplementary Data 3). Each base position was converted to codon coding using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)139 and RefSeq as reference data. Kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction was performed on the tested variants from the sets of genes involved (FDR < 0.05). Phospho-serine, phospho-threonine, and phospho-tyrosine sites were predicted using PhosphoSitePlus140. The prediction scores greater than and equal to 0.5 were considered predictive of a protein phosphorylation site. The rare variant discovery power for phosphorylation disrupting mutations was limited when not restricted to pLOF variants.IAV siRNA screen methodssiRNA reverse transfectionA549 cells were reverse transfected in arrayed, 24-well format with 290 gene-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon, siGENOME siRNA SMARTpool cherry picked pre-designed library, 0.1 nmol/well), non-targeting control siRNA (Dharmacon, D-001206-14-05) or IAV NP-targeting control siRNA (Dharmacon, custom sequence 5’-GGAUCUUAUUUCUUCGGAGUU-3’). In each well of a 24-well plate (Fisher, 08-772-1), siRNA was diluted to final concentration 75 nM gene-targeting siRNA, 75 nM non-targeting siRNA, or 30 nM NP-targeting siRNA in 100 μL with OptiMem Reduced Serum Media (Thermo Fisher, 31985062). One NT and one NP siRNA per 24-well plate were included for each replicate. 2 μL/well Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Thermo Fisher, 13778075) and 98 μL/well OptiMem media were mixed and incubated for 5 minutes. 100 μL RNAiMAX mix and 100 μL siRNA dilution were combined in each well, mixed and incubated for 20 minutes. During this incubation, A549 cells were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin EDTA (Fisher, MT 25-053-CI), pelleted at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes, and resuspended in DMEM with L-glutamine without sodium pyruvate and 20% FBS at a density of 3 × 105 cells/mL. After the 20-minute incubation, 200 μL of 6 × 104 A549 cells were added to each well and returned to incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 hours. The experiment was performed in two sets for PPI and PH targets, each with two replicates per gene to assay IAV infectivity and one replicate per gene to assay cell viability.IAV infectionsAll IAV infections were performed in accordance with BSL2* biosafety procedures. A549 cells were infected in 24-well format 48 hours after reverse transfection. Cell media was aspirated and cells were washed with 400 μL 1X PBS. Cells were infected at MOI 0.1 with Influenza A/WSN/1933 H1N1 virus strain (kindly provided by S. Chanda lab) diluted in a total of 100 μL 0.5% BSA in 1X PBS per well. Plates were returned to incubate for 1 hour at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and rocked by hand every 10 minutes during incubation. Following adsorption, virus inoculum was aspirated, and 400 μL DMEM (with L-glutamine without sodium pyruvate) with 0.1% FBS, 0.3% BSA, 0.5 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin and 1X Pen/Strep, was added to each well. Cells were returned to incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2. At 24 hours post-infection, cells were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin, moved to a 96-well U-bottom plate, pelleted at 800 × g for 3 minutes, and fixed in 150 μL 1% formaldehyde in 1X PBS. Cells were stored at 4 °C until cell staining and flow cytometry.Cell staining and flow cytometryThe percentage of A549 cells infected with IAV was quantified by immunostaining for IAV NP followed by flow cytometry in 96-well format on an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher), as described above (Validation of IAV-Human PPIs M2-ATP6V1A and NEP-AHNAK in IAV-Infected Cells Methods).Live-cell amine-reactive viability staining followed by flow cytometry was used to quantify non-viable A549 siRNA knockdown cells. 48 hours after reverse transfection, cells were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin, neutralized with DMEM with L-glutamine without sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS and 1X Pen/Strep, and transferred from 24-well plates to 96-well U bottom plates. To remove and exchange buffers between incubations and washes, cells were pelleted in 96-well plates at 800 × g for 3 minutes. Cells were pelleted and incubated in 100 μL/well 1:500 Ghost Dye Red 710 (Tonbo Biosciences, 13-0871-T100) in 1X PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature protected from light. Cells were pelleted and washed twice with 100 μL/well MACS buffer (PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% BSA; filtered through 500 mL EMD Millipore Stericup™ Sterile Vacuum Filter Units .22 μM PVDF (Fisher, SCGVU05RE)). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 150 μL 1X PBS, and immediately analyzed in 96-well format on an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher). Forward scatter voltage was set at 60 and side scatter voltage at 280 (R1, A549 singlet cells), and Ghost Dye Red 710 signal quantified by red laser 2 at voltage 260 (dead cells). 100 μL of cells were acquisitioned and all events recorded at 1000 μL/min.Final cell gating (Supplementary Fig. 6A) and quantification for data analysis of %Ghost 710+ cells (percent dead cells) and %NP+ cells (percent IAV infectivity) was performed with FlowJo software (version 9.3.2). For cell viability, %Ghost710+ cells (percent dead cells) and %Ghost 710- cells (percent alive cells) for each siRNA knockdown are reported as calculated with FlowJo (Supplementary Data 4). For IAV infectivity, singlet cell count and %NP+ cells for each experimental siRNA are reported as calculated with FlowJo (Supplementary Data 4). Singlet cell count was used as a readout for cell viability of A549 cells with siRNA knockdown and IAV infection. Singlet cell count and %NP+ cells for each experimental siRNA was normalized to the mean cell count or %NP+ cells of non-targeting (NT) control siRNA corresponding to each set of 24-well plates transfected, infected, collected and stained concurrently. Log2 fold changes in viability (singlet cell count experimental siRNA vs NT siRNA) and in percent IAV infection (%NP+ cells experimental siRNA vs NT siRNA) were calculated from these values (Supplementary Data 4). Data were thresholded on log2 fold change due to the small sample size of the screens.SARS-CoV-2 siRNA screen methodssiRNA transfectionsA549 cells stably expressing the ACE2 receptor (A549-ACE2) were kindly provided by O. Schwartz and were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep and 10 μg/mL blasticidin S (Sigma, SBR00022). An siRNA library (Dharmacon, OnTargetPlus siRNA SMARTpool cherry picked pre-designed library, 2 nmol/well) of 54 target genes of interest, a non-targeting control and an ACE2-targeting control was used to transfect A549-ACE2 cells, previously seeded at a density of 6250 cells per well in a 384-well plate. Briefly, 0.1 μL of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent and 4 pmoles of each siRNA pool were diluted in a final volume of 10 μL of OptiMEM. Following 5 minutes of incubation, 10 μL of the siRNA-lipid complexes were added to the cells, which were then incubated for 48 hours. Cells were then either infected with SARS-CoV-2 or left untreated for another 72 hours to determine cell viability using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent viability assay (Promega, G7570) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Luminescence was measured in a Tecan Infinity 2000 plate reader, and the percentage of metabolically active cells was calculated by normalizing the values to those obtained in untreated (100% viability) and 4% formalin-treated (0% viability) conditions included in each experiment. Experiments were performed in technical triplicate, with two biological replicates for PPI targets (total n = 6 per gene) and three biological replicates for PH targets (total n = 9 per gene).Virus infections and qRT-PCR quantificationThe SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020) strain was a kind gift from the National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses at Institut Pasteur Paris, and was propagated once in VeroE6 cells to generate viral stock. 48 hours post-transfection, A549-ACE2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1 PFU per cell. Briefly, cell media was removed and 20 μL of viral inoculum, prepared in serum-free media, was added to each well. After 1 hour adsorption at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed and replaced by DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and Pen/Strep. The supernatant was harvested 72 hours post-infection and heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 5 minutes. The presence of viral genomes was subsequently quantified using the Luna Universal One-Step RT-qPCR kit (New England Biolabs, E3005S). Specific primers targeting the N gene (5′-TAATCAGACAAGGAACTGATTA-3′ [forward] and 5′-CGAAGGTGTGACTTCCATG-3′ [reverse]) were used as previously described141. RT-qPCR was performed under the following cycling conditions in an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 6 thermocycler: 55 °C for 10 minutes, 95 °C for 1 minute, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 seconds, followed by 60 °C for 1 min. The number of viral genomes in the supernatant was calculated by performing a standard curve with RNA derived from a viral stock with a known viral titer, and is expressed as PFU equivalents per mL. These data were then used to compute log2 fold changes for experimental siRNA normalized to replicate-matched non-targeting controls. The log2 fold changes were computed separately for each replicate, and the median and median absolute deviation (MAD) were then calculated for each sample across all its replicates in the screen set (six replicates for PPI and nine replicates for PH). The PPI and PH screen sets were analyzed separately, and the results are reported in Fig. 5F–G, Supplementary Fig. 6B and Supplementary Data 4. P-values were calculated using two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Data were thresholded on log2 fold change due to the small sample size of the screens.Antiviral compound screen methodsCompound treatment, cytotoxicity and IAV antiviral assaysPPI-targeting and kinase-targeting compounds were manually curated by target-specific literature search performed by specialists within our group. IAV PB2-targeting compound Pimodivir (VX-787) was included as a positive control due to its antiviral activity against multiple H1N1-, H3N2- and H5N1-subtype IAV in human cell and mouse models and in patients142,143,144. Compounds were purchased from vendors specified in Supplementary Data 5. Drug antiviral assays were performed as compounds and IAV strains were received and available, and each set of compounds was performed alongside the Pimodivir control. For drug antiviral assays, A549 cells were seeded at 8,000 cells per well in DMEM growth media described above in 96-well plates (Falcon, 353072) 24 hours before IAV infection. Cells were pretreated with compound 2 hours before infection, where cell growth media for the corresponding well was replaced with media containing the indicated concentrations of compound (Supplementary Figure 7), or the equivalent volume of DMSO vehicle (control). The only exception is Pimodivir, which was added at 0.2 μM, 0.06 μM, 0.02 μM, 7 nM, 2 nM or 0.8 nM. Each compound or DMSO vehicle was tested in triplicate. Cells were mock-infected for cell toxicity assay, or infected with IAV for antiviral assay. Drug-containing media was removed and replaced with A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (MOI 0.5 PFU per cell), A/Wyoming/03/2003 H3N2 (MOI 0.5 PFU per cell), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 HALo (MOI 0.05 PFU per cell), or no virus in 0.5% BSA in 1X PBS containing TPCK-trypsin. Cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C to allow virus adsorption. Virus inoculum was subsequently removed, and 100 μL of drug- or vehicle-containing media was added. Uninfected A549 cells were assayed for cytotoxicity in parallel with the antiviral assay, matched for time and concentration. For cytotoxicity, 10 μL of Cell Proliferation Kit I (MTT) labeling reagent (Roche, 11465007001) was added to each well to a final concentration 0.5 mg/mL, and incubated for 3 hours at 37 °C. 100 μL of solubilization solution (Roche, 11465007001) was then added to each well, and plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Spectrophotometrical absorbance of each well was measured using a microplate (ELISA) reader (BioTek Instruments, NEO2SM) to quantify cell viability. For IAV infection, cells were fixed to the 96-well plate in final concentration 4% formaldehyde for 20 minutes and immunostained for IAV NP protein with a DAPI counterstain at room temperature. Briefly, cells were washed three times with 1X PBS for 5 minutes, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific, 9002-93-1) in 1X PBS for 15 minutes, blocked in 1% BSA in 1X PBS for 1 hour and incubated in 1:1000 anti-IAV NP (an in-house monoclonal antibody HT103, provided by Dr. Thomas Moran, Thomas.Moran@mssm.edu) and DAPI (Thermo Scientific, 62248) for 1 hour. Cells were washed again three times with 1X PBS for 5 minutes, and incubated in 1:1000 goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 (Invitrogen, A11029) in the dark for 1 hour. Cells were washed twice in 1X PBS for 5 minutes, suspended in 1X PBS and subsequently analyzed by Celigo Image Cytometer (Nexcelom) using instrument cell counting software to count the total number of IAV-infected cells (green channel, 536 nm). Infectivity was measured by the accumulation of viral NP protein (fluorescence accumulation). Percent infection was quantified as ((Infected cells/Total cells) - Background)*100, and the DMSO control was then set to 100% infection for analysis. Data analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism (version 9.3.0), using nonlinear regression fit and fit hill functions to identify IC50, IC90, CC10 and CC50 values (Supplementary Data 5). Selectivity index (SI) for each compound was calculated as CC50/IC50 (Supplementary Data 5), and compounds with a SI > 2 were reported as antiviral.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

These recommendations are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce and license influenza vaccines.ObjectivesAnalyze the antigenic and genetic characteristics of seasonal influenza viruses circulating and infecting humans, taking into consideration the available epidemiological and clinical information from individual countries and regions;Make recommendations on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2024 southern hemisphere influenza season;Review the antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent A(H7N9) and A(H5) viruses that the WHO Collaborating Centres of the GISRS received and the need to develop new A(H7N9) and A(H5) candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes; andReview the antigenic and genetic characteristics of other subtype or variant influenza viruses infecting humans recently, and the need to develop new candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes.Participants (by invitation)Representatives from WHO Collaborating Centres for influenza (CCs) of GISRS;Representatives from WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories (ERLs) of GISRS;Representatives from National Influenza Centres and WHO H5 Reference Laboratories of GISRS;Representatives from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Modelling, Evolution, and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases; andRepresentatives from the OIE/FAO Network of expertise on animal influenza (OFFLU).Provisional main agenda itemsReview of antigenic and genetic characterization data of seasonal, A(H7N9), A(H5) and other subtypes or variant influenza viruses analysed by the WHO Collaborating Centres and other reference laboratories;Review of the global influenza activity;Analysis of results of vaccine serological studies;Recommendations for the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2024 southern hemisphere influenza season;Review of the need and subsequent selection of new A(H7N9), A(H5) and other subtype or variant viruses for the development of new candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes.

The lineages were distinct and offered little cross-protection. In 2012, experts solved the problem by recommending the inclusion of both, which saw the arrival of quadrivalent (four-strain) vaccines. However, there haven't been any confirmed detections of the Yamagata influenza B lineage since March 2020, and today the World Health Organization (WHO) flu vaccine strain-selection committee recommended switching back to trivalent (three-strain) vaccines that include two influenza A strains plus just the influenza B Victoria vaccine strain. The group met this week to recommend the strains to include in the Southern Hemisphere's 2024 vaccines. They also looked at the latest zoonotic influenza viruses and picked two new candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic-preparedness purposes. New influenza A strains for Southern Hemisphere vaccines The experts recommended swapping out the 2009 H1N1 and H3N2 components in the Southern Hemisphere's 2023 vaccine, with different vaccine virus strains for egg-based and cell-based vaccines. For egg-based vaccines in the coming year, they recommend including an H1N1 virus similar to influenza A/Victoria/4897/2022 and an H3N2 virus similar to A/Thailand/8/2022. And for cell-based vaccines, they recommend including an H1N1 virus similar to A/Wisconsin/67/2022 and an H3N2 virus similar to A/Massachusetts/18/2022. The recommendations are similar to the current Northern Hemisphere vaccine except for the cell-based H3N2 strain. For the trivalent B strain, they suggest a virus similar to B/Austria/1359417/2021 as the Victoria lineage strain, the same as for the current Northern Hemisphere vaccine. If companies make quadrivalent vaccines, the group suggested a Yamagata lineage B virus similar to B/Phuket/3073/2013, the same as the Northern Hemisphere vaccine recommendation. In a Q and A that accompanied today's vaccine strain recommendations, the WHO said there have been no naturally occurring Yamagata lineage viruses confirmed since March 2020 and that it’s unlikely that they are circulating in people. "Therefore, it is the opinion of the WHO influenza vaccine composition advisory committee that the inclusion of B/Yamagata lineage antigens in influenza vaccines is no longer warranted," they wrote. New pandemic-preparedness candidate vaccine viruses against H9N2, H3N2v When the advisory groups meet twice each year to recommend flu strains for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere flu seasons, they also assess the latest zoonotic influenza strains to see if any candidate vaccine seed strains are needed for pandemic preparedness. In a separate report, the group proposed two new candidate vaccine viruses, one targeting H9N2 that is similar to A/AnhuiTianjiaan/11086/2022. The other is a vaccine virus that targets variant H3N2 (H3N2v) and is similar to A/swine/Iowa/23TOSU0850/2023.

Protecting yourself from these potentially dangerous viruses is best done by getting the flu vaccine and practicing everyday prevention techniques like:AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyProper handwashing.Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.Avoiding people who are sick.Wearing masks in situations when you can’t avoid people who are sick, such as caring for a sick child.We talked with infectious disease doctor Sherif Mossad, MD, about the strains of flu and how you can keep from getting sick this flu season.“What all flu strains have in common are the symptoms they cause,” Dr. Mossad says. “Fever. Headache. Cough. Those are the three cardinal manifestations of all flu viruses. Flu can cause stomach issues for some people, too, but ‘stomach flu’ is really a misnomer.”What are the strains of flu?There are three types of flu viruses that affect people. They’re known as influenza viruses A, B and C. Influenza A and influenza B viruses are the heavy hitters. They’re the ones that cause the most severe illness and lead to widespread outbreaks. Influenza C viruses cause mild illnesses in people. They’re more similar to a common cold, Dr. Mossad says, and they aren’t detected by flu tests.(Fun fact: There is an influenza D virus, but it’s mostly found in cattle and hasn’t been known to affect people.)When people talk about the flu, it’s really influenza A and B viruses. They’re the viruses that are responsible for our annual flu season.AdvertisementInfluenza AInfluenza A viruses are the most common flu viruses. They’re the cause of regular seasonal flu outbreaks, as well as global flu pandemics. Influenza A viruses can affect both people and animals.The 1918 pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (what some people call the “swine flu”), for example, were influenza A virus outbreaks.Dr. Mossad says influenza A virus outbreaks usually occur earlier in the flu season. In the Northern Hemisphere, influenza A is most likely to make its rounds from October to March.Common strains of influenza A include the H1N1 and H3N2 varieties.Influenza BInfluenza B viruses affect only people, not animals, and they don’t spread to the point of pandemics. Influenza B viruses are more likely to make you sick later in the flu season, from about January to May in the Northern Hemisphere.Flu naming conventionsThere are so many different strains of flu viruses that the World Health Organization (WHO) created an internationally accepted naming convention to help track them.The name of each virus is made up of:The antigenic type (A, B, C or D).The host of origin (like swine, equine, chicken, etc.). For human-origin viruses, no host of origin designation is given.Geographical origin.Strain number.Year of collection.For influenza A viruses, the name includes a number value for two proteins found on the virus’ surface. They’re hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). For example, influenza A(H1N1) virus and influenza A(H5N1) virus.The 2009 pandemic virus was assigned a distinct name: A(H1N1)pdm09 to distinguish it from the seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses that circulated prior to the pandemic.When humans are infected with influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs, these viruses are called variant viruses and are designated with the letter “v” (for example, an A(H3N2)v virus).So, for example, the A/Sydney/05/97(H3N2) virus is an influenza A virus that originated in Sydney, is strain number five, was collected in 1997 and is an H3N2 subtype.Long story short: There are boatloads of flu strains out there. And they’re constantly changing and creating new viruses.How does the flu mutate every year?Dr. Mossad explains there are two ways the flu virus mutates.Antigenic driftrefers to the small ways in which the flu virus mutates each year. Antigenic drift is the reason for annual flu epidemics. So, even if you had one strain of H3N2 last year, it’s now a little different, and you can get it again this year.Antigenic shiftis a tidal wave of flu virus mutation.“Antigenic shift is when viruses change so much that you wind up with a virus that humans have never been exposed to at all,” Dr. Mossad says. “That’s what happened in 2009 with the H1N1 swine flu virus. It was an entirely new virus to humans, so no one had built up any immunity to it at all.”How does the flu vaccine work?Each year, the WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitor trends to determine the strains of flu that’ll be most common. And each year, the flu vaccine is created to protect you from what these experts expect will be the two most prevalent influenza A viruses and two most prevalent influenza B viruses for that flu season.AdvertisementRemember, the flu virus mutates. Fast. So, getting a flu shot every year is the absolute best method to protect yourself from the strains that are likely to make their rounds this season.Protect yourself from the fluIn addition to getting your flu shot every fall, Dr. Mossad suggests these best practices to stay healthy this flu season:Practice good hand-washing hygiene. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.

Video Ad Feedback How vaccines stop the spread of viruses 01:26 - Source: CNN CNN — When the World Health Organization recommended on Friday which influenza viruses to target in vaccines for next year, it removed a family of viruses that hasn’t been seen since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sick woman wiping her nose with tissue paper Luis Alvarez/Digital Vision/Getty Images/FILE Is it a cold, flu or Covid-19? A doctor helps sort it out As Covid-19 began to spread widely in 2020, people took protective measures such as masking, washing hands and avoiding contact with others — and flu infections plummeted. Although flu has rebounded, the family of viruses known as influenza B/Yamagata did not, suggesting it may have been driven to extinction. Looking ahead to the 2024 Southern Hemisphere flu season, experts advising WHO on Friday recommended trivalent vaccines, which target three types of flu, include two influenza A strains, H1N1 and H3N2, and an influenza B/Victoria strain. Quadrivalent vaccines, which target four types of flu, can still target a B/Yamagata lineage component. WHO advisers said in a news conference on Friday that since no B/Yamagata infections had been identified in years, there was no benefit to including it in vaccines. “That’s not to say that it’s bad to have it in the vaccine, it’s just no longer needed in the vaccine at this point in time and no longer warranted,” David Wentworth, director of the Collaborating Centre for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at the news conference. “So our recommendation was to remove that component.” Bianca Perez, nurse practitioner at CVS Minute Clinic in Miramar, Florida, administers a flu vaccine to Giselle Castillo-Righton of Miramar on Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2023. (Carline Jean/South Florida Sun Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) Carline Jean/South Florida Sun Sentinel/TNS/Getty Images/FILE Moderna says mRNA flu shot generates better immune response in study than currently available vaccine Flu vaccines are updated regularly because the viruses evolve continuously. WHO’s recommendations are a guide for regulators and manufacturers around the world, but final decisions about what components to include are made by individual countries. WHO’s recommendations for the Southern Hemisphere are typically made in September and recommendations for the Northern Hemisphere are made in February; those schedules allow enough time for regulatory sign-off and production and distribution of the vaccines ahead of each hemisphere’s flu season. In their report on the 2024 Southern Hemisphere flu vaccine recommendations, WHO’s advisers also considered that use of B/Yamagata viruses to manufacture the vaccines poses a “theoretical risk of reintroduction into the population.” That theoretical risk can be mitigated if B/Yamagata is excluded from the vaccines, they wrote. “We’re balancing the absence of circulation of the Yamagata lineage virus with a theoretical risk that we are manufacturing and using a component that’s not necessary,” said Kanta Subbarao, director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Australia.

The vaccines being administered in the United States for the current flu season are quadrivalent vaccines — two influenza A viruses, H1N1 and H3N2, and two influenza B viruses, including a Yamagata lineage. Evidence from the earlier Southern Hemisphere season suggests they will be a good match for the viruses circulating this fall and winter. WHO advisers emphasized that flu vaccines are safe and effective, no matter which formulation a country uses. Wentworth said the US Food and Drug Administration has been looking into whether to shift to a trivalent vaccine for future flu seasons, but it’s not a change that can happen overnight, given the licensing and manufacturing shifts needed. The FDA’s vaccine advisory committee is scheduled to meet October 5 to discuss recommendations for flu vaccines to be offered in the Southern Hemisphere in 2024.

Infectious Diseases Influenza Featured Expert: Patrick Mularoni, M.D. In the winter, people are on the move across the country to spread good cheer … but there is something else that they might be bringing with them, and it’s the flu. So we often hear about “having the flu” but how is that different from a common cold? Patrick Mularoni, M.D., at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital explains the differences. Influenza, the virus that causes flu, actually has a season where it is most common, and we are in time of year when flu spreads across the United States just like travelers who are going home for the holidays. Influenza is much like the thousands of viruses that cause the common cold but typically patients with the common cold can still function pretty well. When you get the flu, you can’t or don’t want to get out of bed. When we are trying to compare the symptoms to determine whether you have the flu or a common cold, both will have runny nose, cough and even fever but with the flu, these symptoms are usually worse. Patients with the flu also will complain of body aches, fatigue, and typically run fevers for multiple days. So the flu makes you feel worse, but is it more dangerous than the common cold? Flu causes inflammation in the lungs. The very young and very old are at increased risk to develop pneumonia when they get the flu. Most children can handle the infection, but those with cerebral palsy, lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis or even asthma are susceptible to secondary bacterial infections that lead to hospitalizations. Flu is a bad actor and although flu deaths are higher in individuals at the extremes of age and those with chronic medical problems, it also can lead to death in previously healthy kids and this is the reason why we have a vaccine and why it is recommended for everyone over 6 months old. If a family is planning on traveling over the holidays, how do they know if they are going to an area that has flu right now? The Centers for Disease control produce a map that shows where flu is the most prominent. The most important thing to know is that if you are travelling, especially by plane, you are likely to travel through an area with flu and when travelling you are likely to encounter someone who has been in an area with higher flu activity. What’s the best way to avoid flu? Influenza is a highly contagious illness that is spread when someone with the virus coughs or sneezes, sending particles into the air and onto surfaces where we pick them up. Proper hygiene is a good way to avoid it. Also if you’re flying with little ones, you should wipe down seats and tray tables when you get onto the plane. Another important tip is that anyone over the age of 6 months should get vaccinated now before the infection is widespread in our area. Get yourself vaccinated to not only protect yourself but also those people you encounter in your community.

How should these vaccines be classified, treated and received — and on what time scale? Are there advantages to receiving vaccines simultaneously, or is it better to space vaccines out over time? Here’s what to consider. What’s available Influenza and COVID-19 vaccines will be available for all individuals 6 months of age and older. RSV vaccines will be available for individuals 60 years of age and older, as well as pregnant individuals at 32-36 weeks’ gestation. Finally, nirsevimab is recommended by CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for all infants 8 months of age or less who are about to enter their first RSV season. Nirsevimab is also recommended for infants and young children 8 to 19 months of age who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease and who are entering their second RSV season. Special considerations/classifications for nirsevimab Unlike the other influenza, COVID-19 and RSV vaccines available during this fall/winter season, nirsevimab is a monoclonal antibody, classified as a drug by FDA. It is “vaccine-like” in that it is an “immunization” recommended by CDC’s ACIP and covered under the Vaccines for Children program. However, it is “drug-like” in that potential adverse events occurring after nirsevimab administration should be reported to FDA (through MedWatch or the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System), not the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. (If children receive any non-nirsevimab vaccine simultaneously with nirsevimab, any potential subsequent adverse events should be reported both to MedWatch/FAERS and VAERS.) CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research are working together to ensure continuous and robust safety monitoring of nirsevimab. When it may be best to administer vaccines simultaneously Simultaneous administration of these vaccines is likely the best option for most patients. CDC guidance states that influenza, COVID-19 and RSV vaccines can all be given at the same time to eligible individuals. For infants between 6 and 8 months of age, CDC recommends simultaneous administration of nirsevimab and COVID-19 vaccine. Simultaneous administration ensures that individuals who may have difficulty accessing care or may experience several barriers in coming to the clinic are fully protected. Conversely, scheduling multiple vaccination visits is consistently associated with missed visits and/or attrition. Patients receiving multiple vaccines during the same clinic visit may be more likely to experience reactogenicity associated with vaccines, such as fever, headache and pain or swelling at the injection site(s). However, simultaneous administration of vaccines does not negatively affect the immunogenicity or effectiveness of those vaccines. Managing pain and discomfort To minimize pain and discomfort associated with multiple vaccines given simultaneously, providers should, where possible, administer vaccines in different arms or at different injection sites. If patients request the same arm or same vaccine site for multiple vaccines, or if it is not feasible to deliver vaccines in different limbs, it is helpful to separate injection sites by 1 inch or more where possible, to reduce the potential for swelling and pain at injection sites. For patients concerned about pain or who have anxiety relating to needles, providers may consider the use of topical anesthetics. These can reduce pain associated with a needle penetrating skin and can reduce underlying muscle spasms, especially in the case of multiple injections. However, prophylactic use of antipyretics (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) before or at the time of vaccination is not recommended; there is no evidence that these serve to relieve pain, and their use could result in an unwanted suppression of the immune system response to vaccination. For infants or young children, several strategies exist to minimize discomfort during vaccination. These strategies are important to consider especially when administering multiple vaccines. Strategies include: Inject the vaccine that is thought to be the most painful last; when multiple injections are being administered, this can reduce the pain associated with the injections. For children 2 years or younger, being breastfed or bottle-fed before, during and after vaccination is thought to decrease pain by multiple mechanisms, including feeling skin-to-skin contact and providing a distraction. Children 2 years or younger who are not breastfed during vaccination may benefit from a sweet-tasting solution (such as sucrose or glucose) given shortly (1-2 minutes) before the injection. This measure is believed to have an analgesic effect lasting approximately 10 minutes. (Parents should be counseled that this measure is for the purpose of reducing pain associated with vaccination and should not be used regularly at home.) Scenarios where spacing between vaccines could be considered Because administering multiple vaccines at the same visit may result in an increased likelihood of reactogenic events, providers may consider spacing vaccines out for individuals who are concerned about pain, swelling or other similar events. Providers may also want to consider this option for individuals with a history of reactogenic events after vaccination, such as severe swelling or induration. Additionally, individuals who are immunocompromised may wish to consider spacing vaccines out to maximize vaccine-mediated protection and prevent intra-season waning of vaccine effectiveness. In such cases, it may be feasible to space out vaccines if the patient has another scheduled visit or visits with the provider in the near future; however, it will be important to confirm the future scheduled visit is not so late during the winter respiratory virus season so as to leave the patient unprotected during a time when there is community circulation of respiratory virus. Providers should keep in mind that the timing of seasonal respiratory virus epidemics is difficult to predict and can vary substantially by geography. If vaccines are planned to be administered at separate visits, it will be important to schedule those visits before the start of the respiratory virus season. Specific timing considerations for influenza vaccines For older adults and people who are in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, influenza vaccine would be ideally received in September or October. However, if this schedule is not feasible, it is possible to receive influenza vaccination as early as July or August. Individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy in July or August can receive influenza vaccine during that time to maximally protect their infant; transfer of vaccine-mediated antibody across the placenta is maximized in the third trimester of pregnancy. Specific considerations for RSV vaccines for older adults RSV vaccines for older adults are covered under Medicare Part D, whereas influenza and COVID-19 vaccines are covered under Medicare Part B. Depending on the clinic environment and insurance status of the patient, the patient may be required to go to a different location (e.g., a pharmacy) to receive RSV vaccination under Medicare Part D. This could result in RSV vaccination occurring on a different day than influenza and COVID-19 vaccination even when same-day administration of multiple vaccines is intended or planned. Summary For most patients, it will be the most convenient to receive all eligible vaccines during the same clinic visit. The effectiveness of vaccines is not affected with simultaneous administration. For those patients, separate vaccines should be given in different arms (where possible), and other strategies to reduce pain or discomfort should be considered, including topical anesthetics or, for infants, breastfeeding during vaccination. Some patients may want to discuss the possibility of scheduling vaccines at different times with their provider, depending on their immunocompromised status or history of reactogenic events after vaccination. For patients who may benefit from this approach, it is important to ensure the patient has the support needed to return to the clinic or pharmacy for all vaccines scheduled.

As the autumn migratory season starts, the protection of poultry and other farmed animals from wild birds should be prioritised. Biosecurity should be enhanced in fur animal farms. Between 24 June and 1 September 2023, HPAI outbreaks were reported in domestic (25) and wild (482) birds across 21 European countries, according to the latest report on avian influenza by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the EU reference laboratory (EURL).Wild and domestic carnivores continued to be the most affected mammal species A subdivision of the genus, a species is a group of closely related and similar-looking organisms; for example, in the case of Homo sapiens (humans), the second part of the name (sapiens) represents the species with Finland reporting 26 outbreaks in fur farms keeping America mink, red and Arctic foxes, and common raccoon. The most likely source of introduction was contact with wild gulls, but between-farm transmission cannot be completely excluded. Within-farm transmission occurred with some contact animals not showing any clinical signs of infection.ECDC assessed that the risk of infection with HPAI virus in Europe remains low for the general population Community of humans, animals or plants from the same species, and low to moderate for occupationally or otherwise exposed people to infected birds or mammals (wild or domestic). To further reduce the risk of infection, experts recommend avoiding exposure Concentration or amount of a particular substance that is taken in by an individual, population or ecosystem in a specific frequency over a certain amount of time to dead or diseased seabirds or mammals. Now available: improved Bird Flu RadarFrom today on an improved version of EFSA’s Bird Flu Radar is available to everyone. New features allow users to explore weekly predictions of the probability The likelihood that a particular event will occur or that a measured value will fall within a particular range of HPAI introduction in wild birds. Users may subscribe to receive weekly alert emails for their areas of interest. The Bird Flu Radar is closely integrated with EFSA’s Migration Mapping Tool, which shows the movements and abundance of 50 wild bird species, mainly waterbirds, in which avian influenza has been reported.Links to scienceAvian influenza overview June–September 2023How to contact usEFSA Media Relations OfficeTel. +39 0521 036 149E-mail: press [at] efsa.europa.eu (Press[at]efsa[dot]europa[dot]eu)(Only if you are a member of the press)Ask a Question ServiceYou have a question about EFSA’s work?

The announcement was made at an information session at the end of a 4-day meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines, a meeting that is held twice annually. WHO organizes these consultations with an advisory group of experts gathered from WHO Collaborating Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories to analyse influenza virus surveillance data generated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The recommendations issued are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce, and license influenza vaccines for the following influenza season. The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, including those circulating and infecting humans.The WHO recommends that trivalent vaccines for use in the 2024 southern hemisphere influenza season contain the following: Egg-based vaccinesan A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;an A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.Cell culture- or recombinant-based vaccinesan A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;an A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.For quadrivalent egg- or cell culture-based or recombinant vaccines for use in 2024 southern hemisphere influenza season, the WHO recommends inclusion of the following B/Yamagata lineage component:a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.

(Courtesy Image)BROOMFIELD, Colo. — Colorado State Veterinarian Dr. Maggie Baldwin released the last premises quarantine in Colorado enacted as a result of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak. With the release of the final HPAI quarantine, Colorado has achieved HPAI-free status as designated by the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH). Since April 2022, Colorado has experienced the largest foreign animal disease outbreak in state’s history with the loss of more than 6.2 million domestic poultry due to HPAI. This response across the state has taken tremendous collaboration and coordination with local, state, federal, and industry partners. “We are encouraged that we have reached the stage in this devastating outbreak that we have finally released the last premises from quarantine,” said Colorado State Veterinarian Dr. Maggie Baldwin. “The efforts of our response partners and the poultry industry made this an incredibly successful response in Colorado. We believe increased biosecurity in commercial poultry operations and backyard flocks helped stem the transmission of the virus.” No commercial cases of HPAI have been detected in Colorado since December 20, 2022 and no backyard cases have been confirmed since April 24, 2023. In the United States, there has not been a case of HPAI in commercial poultry since April 19, 2023 or in backyard poultry since May 18, 2023, according to the US Department of Agriculture. However, there have been more recent detections at live bird markets and Dr. Baldwin continues to encourage commercial and backyard poultry owners to continue practicing stringent biosecurity measures. “While we have not seen many recent detections in domestic poultry, the virus is still circulating at low levels in the wild bird population. Additional surveillance in the coming weeks will inform what impacts we may see during the fall migration,” said Dr. Baldwin. The USDA’s Defend the Flock program has resources for bird owners, including sample biosecurity plans, videos, and tips on how to keep a healthy flock. Additionally, the Colorado Department of Agriculture has tips on biosecurity, informational webinars, a form to report any sick birds, and more information about HPAI on the Avian Influenza page at ag.colorado.gov/hpai. — Colorado Department of Agriculture Spread the word RECOMMENDED ARTICLES New Backyard Avian Influenza Case Confirmed in ColoradoOctober 19, 2023BROOMFIELD, Colo. — The US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) confirmed a new case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in a backyard flock in Weld County, Colorado.

Influenza, tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), and COVID-19 vaccines can reduce the risk for severe respiratory illness among pregnant women and their infants. What is added by this report? During the 2022–23 influenza season, 47.2% of women received influenza vaccination before or during pregnancy, 55.4% of women with a recent live birth received Tdap vaccination during pregnancy, and 27.3% of women received a COVID-19 bivalent booster vaccine before or during pregnancy. Pregnant women who received a provider recommendation for vaccination were less hesitant about influenza and Tdap vaccines. What are the implications for public health practice? Promotion of efforts to improve vaccination coverage among pregnant women, such as provider recommendation for vaccination and informative conversations with patients to address vaccine hesitancy, could reduce adverse maternal and infant illness and death from vaccine-preventable diseases.

To assess influenza, Tdap, and COVID-19 vaccination coverage among women pregnant during the 2022–23 influenza season, CDC analyzed data from an Internet panel survey conducted during March 28–April 16, 2023. Among 1,814 survey respondents who were pregnant at any time during October 2022–January 2023, 47.2% reported receiving influenza vaccine before or during their pregnancy. Among 776 respondents with a live birth by their survey date, 55.4% reported receiving Tdap vaccine during pregnancy. Among 1,252 women pregnant at the time of the survey, 27.3% reported receipt of a COVID-19 bivalent booster dose before or during the current pregnancy. Data from the same questions included in surveys conducted during influenza seasons 2019–20 through 2022–23 show that the proportion of pregnant women who reported being very hesitant about influenza and Tdap vaccinations during pregnancy increased from 2019–20 to 2022–23. Pregnant women who received a provider recommendation for vaccination were less hesitant about influenza and Tdap vaccines. Promotion of efforts to improve vaccination coverage among pregnant women, such as provider recommendation for vaccination and informative conversations with patients to address vaccine hesitancy, might reduce vaccine hesitancy and increase coverage with these important vaccines to protect mothers and their infants against severe respiratory diseases. Top Introduction Maternal vaccination with influenza vaccine and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during pregnancy can reduce the risk for influenza and pertussis among pregnant women and their infants. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all women who are or might be pregnant during the influenza season receive influenza vaccine, which can be administered at any time during pregnancy (1). ACIP also recommends that women receive Tdap vaccine during each pregnancy, preferably early during the period from 27 to 36 weeks’ gestation (2,3). In addition, COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months,* including women who are pregnant.† Despite recommendations for vaccination, coverage during pregnancy with all three vaccines is low and varies by certain characteristics as well as provider recommendation and offer of vaccination during a visit or referral to a vaccine provider (4,5). Top Methods An Internet panel§ survey was conducted to assess end-of-season influenza and Tdap vaccination coverage estimates among women who were pregnant during the 2022–23 influenza season, as previously described (4). The survey was conducted during March 28–April 16, 2023, among women aged 18–49 years who reported being pregnant at any time since August 1, 2022, through the date of the survey. Among 17,931 women who entered the survey site and answered the screening questions, 2,588 were eligible, and of these, 2,349 (90.8%) completed the survey.¶ Data were weighted to reflect pregnancy status and outcome at the time of survey completion, age, race and ethnicity, and geographic distribution of the total U.S. population of pregnant women. Analysis of influenza vaccination coverage was limited to 1,814 women who reported being pregnant at any time during October 2022–January 2023. A woman was considered to have been vaccinated against influenza if she reported receiving a dose of influenza vaccine (before or during her most recent pregnancy) since July 1, 2022. To accommodate the optimal timing for Tdap vaccination during gestational weeks 27–36, analysis of Tdap vaccination coverage was limited to women who reported having been pregnant at any time since August 1, 2022, and who had a live birth by their survey date. A woman was considered vaccinated with Tdap if she reported receiving a dose of Tdap vaccine during her most recent pregnancy. Among 890 women with a recent live birth, 114 (12.8%) were excluded because they did not know if they had ever received Tdap vaccine (88; 9.9%) or if Tdap vaccine was received during their pregnancy (26; 2.9%), leaving a final analytic sample of 776. The proportion of pregnant women who had received both recommended maternal vaccines was assessed among 775 women (one respondent who was excluded reported her Tdap vaccination status [not vaccinated], but not her influenza vaccination status). COVID-19 vaccination coverage was assessed among 1,252 women who were pregnant at the time of the survey. COVID-19 vaccination coverage was assessed on the basis of receipt of ≥1 dose,** completion of a primary series,†† and receipt of a bivalent booster dose§§ before or during the current pregnancy, according to ACIP recommendations at the time of the survey (6). To assess changes in influenza and Tdap-specific vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women over time, data from the same questions included in surveys conducted during influenza seasons 2019–20 through 2022–23 were used. SAS-callable SUDAAN software (version 11.0.1; RTI International) was used to conduct all analyses. Differences among groups were assessed using t-tests with p-values <0.05 considered statistically significant. All reported increases or decreases are statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed research not involving human subjects, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶ Top Results Among 1,814 women pregnant during October 2022–January 2023, 47.2% reported receiving an influenza vaccination since July 1, 2022 (Table 1); Tdap vaccination coverage during pregnancy was 55.4% among women with a recent live birth. Receipt of both influenza and Tdap vaccines was reported by 25.6% of women with a recent live birth. Vaccination coverage with Tdap alone and both influenza and Tdap vaccines was lower among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) women (31.4% and 12.0%, respectively) than among non-Hispanic White (White) women (62.2% and 26.6%, respectively). Tdap vaccination coverage was also lower among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) women (50.8%) compared with that among White women (62.2%). Influenza vaccination coverage was higher among women who reported receiving a provider offer for vaccination during a visit or a referral to a vaccine provider (61.4%) than among those who received a vaccination recommendation but no offer or referral (22.7%) or who received no recommendation (10.8%). Tdap vaccination coverage was similarly high among women who received an offer or referral (69.1%). Influenza vaccination coverage was lower among women living in rural areas, and both influenza and Tdap vaccination coverage were lower among women with public insurance. Among 1,252 women who were pregnant at the time of the survey, 64.9% reported having received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose, 58.7% reported having completed the primary COVID-19 vaccination series, and 27.3% reported having received a bivalent COVID-19 booster dose (Table 2). Bivalent booster vaccination coverage among women who received a provider recommendation for a bivalent booster (63.2%) was more than nine times that among those who did not (6.8%). Overall, the majority of women who received a bivalent booster dose reported receiving it before their current pregnancy (73.3%). The proportion of respondents who reported being very hesitant about receiving influenza and Tdap vaccines during pregnancy increased significantly during 2022–23 compared with 2019–20. During 2022–23, nearly one quarter (24.7%) of women reported being very hesitant about influenza vaccination during pregnancy compared with 17.2% during 2021–22 and 17.5% during 2019–20. During 2022–23, approximately one in five (19.8%) women reported being very hesitant about Tdap vaccination during pregnancy compared with 14.7% during 2021–22 and 15.1% during 2019–20 (Figure). Hesitancy about influenza and Tdap vaccination has increased since 2019–20 in most demographic subgroups, but remains lower among women who received a provider recommendation for vaccination (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/132911). Top Discussion Findings from this survey indicate that approximately one half of pregnant women have not received influenza or Tdap vaccines, and only one quarter received both vaccines, thereby leaving themselves and their infants vulnerable to influenza and pertussis infection. Influenza vaccination coverage remains low and is >10 percentage points (7) lower than during the 2019–20 season, consistent with other data sources that have shown decreases in influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women since the COVID-19 pandemic.*** Although Tdap vaccination coverage increased by approximately 10 percentage points compared with the previous season, coverage during the 2022–23 season is similar to that during the 2019–20 and 2020–21 seasons (7,8). Approximately three quarters of pregnant women reported not receiving a bivalent COVID-19 booster dose, which might increase the risk for severe COVID-19 disease and pregnancy complications, including hospitalization and death.††† Among pregnant women, influenza, Tdap, and bivalent COVID-19 booster dose coverage remains lower among Black women and those who did not receive a provider recommendation and an offer or referral for vaccination (5,7–10). Studies have noted that a lower percentage of pregnant Black women receive a provider vaccination offer or referral than do women from other racial and ethnic groups (7,10). The current analysis also found that among pregnant women, influenza and Tdap vaccine hesitancy is higher among Black women compared with White women. A separate analysis found that vaccine hesitancy is associated with lower vaccination coverage; however, a higher percentage of pregnant women who were hesitant about influenza vaccination reported being vaccinated if they received a provider offer or referral for vaccination.§§§ These findings along with those from other studies underscore the importance of the equitable provision of provider recommendation and offer or referral for vaccination, in combination with culturally relevant conversations with patients about vaccines, to reduce hesitancy and increase coverage among pregnant women in all racial and ethnic groups and thereby reduce disparities.¶¶¶ CDC has resources to assist providers in effectively communicating the importance of vaccination, such as sharing specific reasons that recommended vaccines are right for the patient and highlighting positive personal or clinical experiences with vaccines.**** In addition, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has an immunization tool kit†††† that includes communication strategies for providers. Limitations The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, this was a nonprobability sample, and results might not be generalizable to all pregnant women in the United States. Second, vaccination status was self-reported and might be subject to recall or social desirability bias. Third, because of small sample sizes, vaccination coverage could not be assessed separately among some racial and ethnic groups. Fourth, Tdap vaccination coverage estimates might be subject to uncertainty, given the small sample size and exclusion of almost 13% of women whose Tdap vaccination status was unknown. A previous sensitivity analysis showed that actual Tdap vaccination coverage could be 6–7 percentage points higher or lower (4). Finally, statistical tests based on the assumption of probability were used to ascertain differences in vaccination coverage among groups in this nonprobability sample and results should be interpreted with caution. Despite these limitations, Internet panel surveys are a useful assessment tool for timely evaluation of influenza, Tdap, and COVID-19 vaccination coverage among pregnant women. Implications For Public Health Practice Maternal vaccination coverage remains suboptimal. Culturally relevant vaccination recommendations from health care providers are critical to improving vaccination coverage, decreasing persistent disparities in vaccination coverage, combatting increases in vaccine hesitancy observed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and reducing adverse maternal and infant illness and associated complications including death from these three vaccine-preventable diseases.

Airborne transmission of HPAI was suspected, as initial bird mortalities were reported near air inlets of poultry houses. In addition, infected farms were distant, indicating that the viruses carried by dust particles might help the viruses travel for long distances in the environment. The objective of this study focused on simulating the airborne transmission of HPAI by using computational modeling to assess the risk of airborne and deposited avian influenza (AI) carried by poultry-litter dust particles. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) modeling was used in this study. Data from 168 infected cases in the Mid-Western area of U.S. were obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and Watt Poultry. The concentration simulation modeling was performed to estimate the airborne and deposited AI concentration carried by PM2.5 dust particles. Results showed that concentrations of airborne AI, deposited AI, and combined AI transmitted to other farms in a day were lower than the minimal infective dose for poultry. In most of the scenarios, the predicted probability of infection showed that Iowa-infected farms and turkey poultry houses had the highest infection probability. The findings may provide an understanding of the risk of airborne HPAI virus carried by dust particles and suggest the factors that influence long-distance airborne transmission.

It includes meat products from turkeys, broilers, and eggs from laying hens. The combined values of these products exceeded 35 billion U.S. dollars in 20201. Poultry products are affordable and important sources of daily protein. In addition, the U.S. poultry industry provides $555.9 billion in economic activity and about 2 million jobs for national populations2. However, this important industry is extremely vulnerable to infectious diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). An example is the 2014–2015 HPAI outbreak in the Mid-Western U.S., resulting in a significant loss of over 50 million birds and 3.3 billion U.S. dollars3.Avian influenza (AI) or bird flu refers to the infectious disease caused by the infection of influenza virus type A from orthomyxoviridea. These viruses are found in wild aquatic birds worldwide and, also can infect domestic poultry, and other bird and certain mammal species. Although avian influenza A viruses can infect wild aquatic birds' intestines and respiratory tracts, other species, such as wild ducks, may not become ill. Avian influenza A viruses are highly infectious among commercial poultry, and some strains can sicken and even kill certain domesticated bird species such as chickens, domestic ducks, and turkeys. As of November 2022, approximately 50 million birds including 265 commercial flocks and 358 backyard flocks have been affected by the 2022 AI outbreak4. AI viruses can be found in infected birds' saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Transmission of the pathogen to naive (susceptible) birds can result from direct contact between birds or by indirect contact with virus-contaminated fomites5.Due to the severity of the disease, AI viruses are divided into two groups including low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses produce little or moderate illness in laying hens and broilers (such as ruffled feathers and a drop in egg production). The majority of avian influenza viruses are low pathogenic, causing little symptoms of illness in infected wild birds. Some low-pathogenic viruses in chickens can evolve into highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. On the other hand, infected chickens suffer from severe sickness and a high death rate due to HPAI viruses. Only a few avian influenza A(H5) and A(H7) viruses are HPAI type A viruses, while the vast majority of avian influenza A(H5) and A(H7) viruses circulating in birds are LPAI viruses. In hens, HPAI type A(H5) or A(H7) virus infections can produce sickness that affects several internal organs, with mortality rates ranging from 90 to 100%, frequently within 48 h6. Infections of HPAI A(H5) and A(H7) viruses in poultry can transmit to wild birds, resulting in the additional geographic spread of the virus when the birds migrate. HPAI viruses are transmitted mainly through direct contact infection. However, with the initial bird mortalities reported near air inlets of poultry houses, there is a high chance that HPAI viruses were transmitted into poultry houses by airborne pathway.In the poultry house, the major components of the air include gases, odors, and dust and droplet nuclei carrying microorganisms. AI viruses are first secreted via birds’ nasal secretions, feces, and saliva. The bird secretions can either be dried and suspended in the air for a long period of time or deposited on the poultry litter surface. The deposited secretions which carry AI are then mixed with poultry litter particles and re-aerosolized into the air by bird activities. Both droplet nuclei and dust particles that carry AI may then be distributed into the poultry house environment and transmitted from barn to barn via ventilation system and transport of air.At susceptible farms, the AI can be sucked in through the ventilation system and be distributed inside the farms. The airborne HPAI viruses are then deposited onto the surface of poultry litter on which they can survive up to 5 days at 24 °C7. In previous studies, authors have reported that most airborne AI viruses are found in dust particles as small as 1–5 µm in size8, 9 at 0.5 m away from poultry housing. It is important to note that fine dust particles (or dust particles with diameters that are generally 2.5 µm and smaller) can travel hundreds of miles10. With the long dispersion range, the AI viruses carried by fine dust particles can be a possible transmission pathway of HPAI.To determine the possibility of long-distance airborne transmission of HPAI carried by poultry dust particles, this study aims at simulating the airborne transmission of HPAI by using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT) to assess the risk of airborne and deposited AI carried by poultry litter dust particles. Compared to other models such as Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) which is also able to simulate the flow of the air, the advantage of HYSPLIT is to integrate the meteorological data into the model which improves the accuracy of the simulation. In the study, 168 infected commercial poultry cases (72% of the national total of the infected commercial farms) in the Mid-Western U.S. were focused on, and data from the period of February 08th, 2022 to May 22nd, 2022, when cases appeared in the area were included in the model. Infected backyard birds accounted for a small number of infected birds with a low number of infected farms, and therefore, were not included in this study.ResultsInfected farm dataA total of 168 infected case data in the Mid-Western U.S. which accounted for about 72% of the national total of commercial farm infections were utilized in the study (Table S2). The time period of February 08th, 2022 to May 22th, 2022 were included in the model. Physical address, county and state, infection confirmation date, and the number of birds infected were collected.Minimal infective dosesThe infective dosage, lung capacity, breathing rate, and exposure duration were all used to compute the MIDa and MIDd. Lung capacity and respiratory rate in turkeys are 7.7 × 10–5 m3 and 2.4 × 103 times h−1, respectively, and 1.4 × 105 m3 and 1.6 × 103 times h−1 in laying hens11. Over a day of exposure, the resulting MIDa values were 210 EID50 m−3 for turkeys and 5880 EID50 m−3 for laying hens. MIDd values were 2837 EID50 m−2 for turkeys and 28,460 EID50 m−2 for laying hens.Viral concentrations in different types of poultry housesThe viral concentrations of AI in different types of poultry houses are reported in Fig. 1 (airborne AI), Fig. 2 (deposited AI), and Fig. 3 (combined concentrations of airborne and deposited AI). The figures show the viral concentrations carried by PM2.5 dust particles in 5 different types of poultry houses with 4 different scenarios including airborne ceiling, deposited ceiling, airborne default, and deposited default. Results show that in all categories, the viral concentrations were lower than MIDa and MIDd lines. This implies that under all scenarios, these commercial farms are likely not to have received viral loads above their MIDa and MIDd. This suggests that there is little risk of sludge development under both normal conditions and worst conditions.Figure 1Concentrations of airborne highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses at the recipient farms.

First, in the default scenario (Fig. 4), deposited AI data show three remarkable results that Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota farms have 14.8%, 11.3%, and 7.5% chance of being infected by AI viruses from the previously infected farm from the Mid-Western area. Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas farms have unremarkable percentages with the highest infection probability of 1.7% of having the chance to be infected from the Mid-Western area. Airborne AI data in the default scenario show low infection probability that Iowa farms, South Dakota farms, Missouri farms, and North Dakota farms have 2.1%, 1.2%, 1.2%, and 0.6% chance to be infected. Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin have lower than 0.5% of chance that can be infected by AI.Figure 4Farm infection probabilities of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses at the recipient farms in default scenario.

However, the chance of the ceiling scenario happening is relatively low compared to the default scenario. The remarkable infection probabilities of deposited AI viruses imply that in the ceiling scenario, susceptible farms in South Dakota can be infected by AI viruses from previously infected farms with a probability up to approximately 79.0%.Figure 5Farm infection probabilities of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses at the recipient farms in ceiling scenario.

There were five poultry house types including breeder, broiler, laying hen, pullet, and turkey that were reported in this study. First, in the default scenario (Fig. 6), deposited AI data show two remarkable results that laying hen farms have 11.9% (the infection probability was measured each day) and turkey farms have 10.3% probability of being infected by AI viruses from the previously infected farm from the Mid-Western area. Broiler, breeder, and pullet farms have unremarkable percentages with the highest infection probability of 1.7% having the chance to be infected by AI from the Mid-Western area. Airborne AI data in the default scenario show low infection probability that turkey farms have 1.4%, laying hen farms have 0.8%, and pullet farms have 0.2% of being infected.Figure 6Farm infection probabilities of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses at different poultry house types in default scenario.

However, the chance of the ceiling scenario happening is relatively low compared to the default scenario. In all scenarios, turkey farms are the poultry house type that has the highest chance to get infected by AI with one exception in the deposited default scenario.Figure 7Farm infection probabilities of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses at different poultry house types in ceiling scenario.

The combined AI concentration is the combined concentration of airborne and deposited AI. The farm infection probabilities were reported based on different poultry house types (Fig. 8) and different states (Fig. 9). Airborne AI, after traveling for a long distance, gets in poultry facilities and stays both air suspended and deposited. The combined AI concentration simulated a more accurate situation happening in poultry facilities. With the combined concentration of AI, the farm infection probabilities are still low in the default scenario with the highest farm infection probabilities in laying hen facilities (11.9%) and in IA state (12.9%). In the ceiling scenario, the highest farm infection probabilities are in turkey facilities (47.4%) and in Iowa state (47.8%).Figure 8Farm infection probabilities of combined concentration of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses at the recipient farms at different poultry house types.

The study reported the viral concentrations simulated by HYSPLIT modeling in AI-infected poultry houses. The resulting hypothetical virus carried by PM2.5 concentrations generated by the HYSPLIT model was relatively low in all types of poultry farms. The concentration of airborne, deposited, and even combined concentration of airborne and deposited AI in these poultry farms were below the MIDa and MIDd values. Most poultry farms are hard to spread AI to surrounding poultry farms and causing infection. Compared to previous studies11, a similar conclusion was reported that the AI concentrations received by poultry farms from infected farms were much lower than the minimal infective dose. When traveling through the air for a long distance, the AI virus can be greatly affected by outdoor conditions. This causes them to be inactivated. A previous study12 reported that the AI virus could live for more than 100 days at 4 °C but was inactivated after 24 h at 28 °C and 30 min at 56 °C. The outbreak of AI in 2022 happened in late spring and early summer when the temperature was typically above 25 °C which can be a possible explanation for the short survival of the AI virus. The study also examined the farm infection probabilities at different farm locations. In the default scenario, when the conditions were more similar to the actual conditions, farm infection probabilities were generally low with the highest farm infection probabilities accounting for 14.8% in deposited AI and 2.1% in airborne AI. In the ceiling scenario, a remarkable farm infection probability was reported in South Dakota, which accounted for 79.0%. Although our results revealed that AI concentrations carried by PM2.5 were much lower than MID, the farm infection data in the ceiling scenario showed a significantly high probability (79.0%) of farm infection. The ceiling scenario stands for the worst situation when all conditions are optimal for the infection of airborne AI. The chance of a ceiling scenario is low.Farm infection probabilities at different poultry house types were calculated in this study. In most scenarios, the turkey farm type showed the highest chance of being infected by long-distance airborne transmission of AI, except in default deposited and default combined, where the turkey farm type has the second highest chance of being infected by AI. These results are consistent with the real statistical report of infected farms according to USDA APHIS4. From February 08th to May 22nd, in total of 168 AI-infected cases, over 125 infected cases are turkey farms compared to 43 cases are from other poultry house types. The fact that the majority of turkey farms are infected by airborne AI might be explained by the ventilation rate (VR) of poultry farms. The typical ventilation rate for turkey is 9.2 m3 h−1 bird−1, for broiler breeder is 7.8 m3 h−1 bird−1, for broiler is 3.9 m3 h−1 bird−1, for laying hen is 2.0 m3 h−1 bird−1, and for pullet is 1.0 m3 h−1 bird−113,14,15. The VR of turkey is higher than the VRs of other poultry house types. With the same number of birds and similar ventilation time, the turkey facilities get more air than other poultry house-type facilities. Thus, it increases the chance turkey farms get airborne AI transmitted from infected farms. In addition, the structure of turkey house makes the birds easier to expose to airborne AI. Turkey house type has an open sidewall structure which let the birds expose more to outside air16, while the laying hen house structure is closed. With this open structure of the house, turkeys have more chance to receive airborne AI than laying hens. Besides, bird susceptibility to the virus is also a factor that can affect the infection probability. A minimal infective dose is defined as the minimum number of infectious pathogens that causes infection/illness in birds. The MIDs were calculated11. Generally, the MIDs of turkeys were much lower than those of laying hens and other types of birds which implies that turkeys are much more susceptible to viruses than the other bird species. This factor can increase the chance of turkeys getting infected compared to the others.In general, the infection probability estimated using deposited AI concentration, compared to that estimated using airborne AI concentration, was higher for all types of poultry. Deposited AI, after long-distance travel, can be deposited on any surface in the poultry farm and be picked up directly by birds. Meanwhile, airborne AI can infect birds by being inhaled by birds. Even though airborne AI can be suspended in poultry houses for long periods of time, the survivability may be compromised by the dehydration effect caused by the ventilation system which reduced the survivability of microorganisms in poultry facilities17. On the other hand, deposited AI can stay longer in poultry facilities by depositing on poultry litter or bird feces. This environment can provide preferential culture conditions for deposited AI, thus, supporting the survival of deposited AI. These discussions are consistent with previous studies. In a study conducted by Baleshwari7, authors reported that at 24 °C, the viral concentration in feces would reduce only about 20% after 24 h. While other authors18, 19 reported that human or pig-adapted influenza A virus subtypes showed a significant decrease (tenfold) in their viability in the air in 24 h. With better survivability, deposited AI had more chance to cause infection in birds rather than airborne AI. In addition, birds are often kept in confined spaces with limited ventilation and are in close contact with contaminated surfaces, feed, and water. The virus can then spread easily from bird to bird through contact with contaminated surfaces, feed, or water. In contrast, after getting in the poultry house, airborne AI requires the infected birds to be in close proximity to one another and for the virus to remain airborne for a sufficient period of time.In the study, the type of poultry house, flock size, and distance from infected farms to recipient farms were the factors, besides the concentration of virus, that play a crucial role in the probability of infection in poultry. Larger flocks were found to have a higher chance of infection, while smaller flocks were at low infection risk. For instance, turkey poultry facilities generally have the highest chance of becoming infected. Yet, in the default deposited scenario, even though fewer laying hen farms were affected by AI, the infection probabilities of these farms still showed a higher chance than those of turkeys. This could be explained by that in this scenario, most of the infected laying hen farms were located in Iowa and Nebraska and had large ranges of flock sizes. The smallest flock had 915,900 birds, while the largest had 5,011,700 birds20. These flock sizes were significantly larger than those in turkey facilities. The study also found that as the distance from a source farm increases, the concentration of the virus decreases, reducing the probability of airborne infection. For instance, in the deposited ceiling scenario, the South Dakota farm infection probabilities were significantly high (about 79.0%). The infected and recipient farms were close to each other and mainly located in South Dakota, which made the recipient farms highly susceptible to the AI virus from infected farms.Improper carcass management during AI outbreaks could lead to the spread of infections from infected farms to susceptible farms, potential for future legal liability, and public controversy21. To restrict the spread of the AI, infected farms are depopulated (euthanized). The depopulation will generate a considerable number of carcasses, as well as dust and manure. All of these wastes, if not being properly managed, can lead to the spread of airborne AI to susceptible farms. Glanville et al.22 reported that improper composting can result in the formation of airborne particles, spreading pathogens. In addition, garbage management can be an important risk factor for the spread of AI. If the trash collection site were not properly secured, it can cause virus leakage. Especially commercial poultry operation may share a common trash collection site23, this structure can post the risk of airborne spread of AI from the trash collection site to susceptible farms.Although utilizing the HYSPLIT model can address the risk of long-distance travel of AI, this is a meteorological model which mainly focuses on the effects of meteorological factors on the virus. Some other factors including the interaction between dust particles or between dust particles and viruses, wild birds, humans, vehicles, and so on, were excluded from the model. In addition, the minimum accuracy distance of the model was 12 km, thus any farms within 12 km were not well simulated in the model. The HYSPLIT model helps in understanding the possibility and risk of airborne transmission in different locations as well as different poultry house types, but confirmed airborne transmission cannot be concluded without genetic analysis. In addition, the study reported the AI levels found in the recipient farms. The model predicted airborne viral concentrations of less than 10–3.5 EID50 m−3 in the default scenario, both for airborne and deposited AI. However, in real-life poultry houses, there is no such air sampler that can accurately collect viable airborne and deposited AI. As a result, it is challenging to confirm the accuracy of the meteorology model, including HYSPLIT. As a result, utilizing HYSPLIT may be a more sensitive method to explain and predict the potential outbreak of AI caused by airborne transmission. Finally, the findings of the infection probabilities in various poultry house types and across different states can provide a comprehensive understanding of which poultry house types have a high chance of being exposed to airborne avian influenza, thereby allowing for proper preventive measures to be taken.MethodsInfected farm dataData from 168 infected cases in the U.S. were obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and Watt Poultry (WattPoultry.com). Each confirmed case datum included physical address, county and state, infection confirmation date, and the number of birds infected. In this study, 168 infected commercial poultry cases (72% of the national total of commercial farm infections) in the Mid-Western U.S. were focused on, and data from the period of February 08th, 2022 to May 22nd, 2022, were included in the model. The dispersion simulation modeling was performed to examine if the confirmed cases in the Mid-West received air from other farms before being infected and estimate the concentration of airborne AI received. The reason for selecting data from the commercial farms and excluding data from backyark farms in the Mid-Western area was that although the number of backyard flocks infected was higher than commercial flocks, the number of infected birds per backyard flock was significantly lower than the number of birds infected per commercial farm20.HYSPLIT modelingThe HYSPLIT model (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Washington, D.C., U.S) is a computational model that is utilized to calculate the trajectory of air parcels. This helps to establish both the direction and distance that a particular air parcel, along with any associated air pollutants, will travel. HYSPLIT modeling can also estimate air pollutant dispersion, chemical transformation, and deposition. In this study, the HYSPLIT model was used to simulate the air movement of PM2.5 which hypothetically carries AI to examine if the PM2.5 particles travel passing through other farms before the farms became infected. The modeling also computed the concentration of airborne and deposited AI carried by PM2.5 dust particles (or fine dust particles) in the farms. The AI survival time of 24 h at 28 °C and a period of 21 days prior to the infection confirmation dates11 was applied in the modeling. Three different periods, namely 8 a.m., 4 p.m., and 12 a.m. (Local Standard Time) were calculated separately to reduce the temporal wind speed and direction-varied effects. Airborne and deposited AI were examined at the height of 6 m above ground level (m agl), considering the typical height of the poultry houses. The height of typical air inlets which is 1.5 m was applied in the model.The concentration of airborne AI carried by PM2.5 was assessed by using both default and ceiling input data in the HYSPLIT model. The AI concentration has been reported to be detected predominantly from fine dust particles8, and with the long range of transmission, the PM2.5 size can be a big concern for public health. The default data stands for the representative data from scientific references, and the ceiling data stands for parameters that might happen in the worst scenarios. The required parameters were provided in Table S1.Model processingForward concentration modeling was used to assess the possibility of infections from infected poultry farms to other farms. First, the AI data collected daily from APHIS and Watt Poultry websites were imported into HYSPLIT modeling. The AI data were divided into four categories including default PM2.5, ceiling PM2.5, deposited default PM2.5, and deposited ceiling PM2.5. Default PM2.5 and ceiling PM2.5 stand for the airborne AI concentration carried by PM2.5 in the default scenario and worst scenario, respectively. Deposited default PM2.5 and deposited ceiling PM2.5 are the AI concentration carried by PM2.5, after being aerosolized, being deposited on the surface of poultry facilities in the default scenario and worst scenario respectively. Hypothetically, the deposited AI, after being transmitted into the poultry house and deposited on surfaces, would be picked up by birds in the poultry house. Meteorological data was downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, Washington, D.C., U.S.) website for each day. To reduce the variability of wind direction as well as meteorological conditions, the model is run every 8-h interval which results in three trajectories covering the air arrival time at 8 am, 4 pm, and 12 am Local Standard Time (LST). After processing the data, airborne AI concentration data collected from the modeling were then exported as kmz files which were then loaded in Google Earth Pro (Google LLC, Mountain View, CA, U.S.). With concentration modeling, the clear viral pattern movement of AI can be observed on Google Earth (video V1). The AI concentration data corresponding to the 4 scenarios and types of poultry farms would be reported. The modeling concentrations of AI were then compared to the minimal infective doses of airborne AI viruses and deposited AI viruses calculated based on formulas (1) (2) and were utilized to assess the possibility of infection for each case.Minimal infective doses for airborne transmissionMinimal infective dose for airborne transmission (MIDa) is the quantity of airborne AI (measured in EID50 m−3) that is necessary to cause infection in a healthy bird. The 50% egg infective dose (EID50) or egg/embryo infective dose 50 is a unit for the concentration of a certain virus. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs/embryos are employed as the culture medium. The original viral sample is serially diluted first. Each dilution is injected into a small number of eggs. Then, this dilution is used to determine the EID50 when 50% of the eggs in a dilution are infected. The MIDa were calculated based on the general minimal infective dose (MIDt). MIDt were 103 EID50 for turkeys24 and 103.5 EID50 for laying hens25. The same MIDa was used for laying hens, broilers, breeders, and pullets. The MIDa values were calculated by the following formula (1):$$\mathrm{MIDa }=\mathrm{ MIDt}\times \frac{1}{v \times r \times 24 },$$ (1) where MIDt is the general infective dose, EID50; v is the tidal volume of the bird, m3; r is respiratory rate, time h−1; and MIDa is the Minimal infective dose for airborne transmission, EID50 m−3 for a day (24 h).Minimal infective dose for deposited (MIDd) AI is the quantity of deposited AI (measured in EID50 m−2) that is necessary to cause infection in a healthy bird. The same MIDd was used for laying hens, broilers, breeders, and pullets. The MIDd values were calculated by the following formula (2):$$\mathrm{MIDd }=\mathrm{ MIDt}\times \frac{1}{s},$$ (2) where MIDt is the general infective dose, EID50; s is the area that a bird needs in the house, 0.11 m2 per bird (or stocking density of 9 birds per m2) for laying hen26 and 0.35 m2 per bird (or stocking density of about 3 birds per m2) for turkey27, m2 bird−1; and MIDd is the Minimal infective dose for deposited AI viruses, EID50 m−2.Farm infection probabilityThe probability of farm infection (formula 4) is determined by the probability of individual-bird infection (formula 3) at a given dosage (d) and flock size (nf). We assumed that 95% of birds might get infected at the (d) dosage, θ was 0.00069 for turkeys and 0.00022 for laying hens11.$$Pi = { 1 } - \, ({1 } - \theta )^{{\text{d}}} ,$$ (3) $$Ph = { 1 } - \, \left( {{1 } - Pi} \right)^{{{\text{nf}}}} ,$$ (4) where Pi is probability of individually bird infection, %; θ is probability of one ID50 infect to bird, %; d is dosage of viruses exposed to a bird, EID50 bird−1 day−1; Ph is is probability of farm infection, %; nf is size of flock, number of birds.

The man's symptoms began on August 5, and he was hospitalized 5 days later. He died on August 20. An investigation revealed that he had been exposed to live domestic poultry before he got sick. Juhan Sonin / Flickr cc China has now reported six H5N6 cases this year. The last case was reported in the middle of August, in a woman from Sichuan province. H5N6 is known to circulate in poultry in some Asian countries, and the first human case was reported in 2014. Of 88 global cases, 87 have been reported from China. Laos is the only other country that has reported a human H5N6 case. Infections involving the strain are often severe or fatal. New poll finds nearly half of adults expect to get new COVID vaccine News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 The latest vaccine monitoring poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) found that nearly half of US adults will definitely or probably get the updated COVID-19 vaccine, a pattern the group said is higher than previous booster campaigns but lower than the initial primary series rollout. The online and telephone poll, conducted during the second week of September, found that 23% will definitely get the new COVID vaccine and 23% will probably get it. As in earlier polls, vaccination intentions reflect a political divide, with Democrats more likely to be vaccinated than Republican respondents. lucigerma / iStock Despite solid uptake intentions for adults, most parents don't intend to have their children vaccinated against COVID, despite a universal recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that everyone ages 6 months and older be immunized. Fewer than 4 in 10 parents said they will get their kids vaccinated against COVID. KFF also asked about intentions to receive other vaccines, finding that most (58%) of adults have already received or plan to receive the flu shot. Also, most (60%) of adults ages 60 and older said they have already gotten or plan to receive the new respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Partisan divides for flu and RSV vaccines were still present, but not as sharp as for the COVID vaccine. Looking to general practice for clues about long COVID News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 dragana991 / iStock In another new study to quantify the clinical features of long COVID, or post COVID condition (PCC), authors publishing in PLoS One describe the key clinical features noted in the UK general-practice setting. Using information about symptoms recorded in primary care consultation notes, the study authors reviewed the health records of those diagnosed by a general practitioner (GP) in England during the first year of the pandemic. Authors compared symptoms among patients following confirmed COVID-19 to produce a list of 89 symptoms and the 30 most common symptoms. The goal was to define the basis on which GPs were suspecting or diagnosing PCC. Fatigue, shortness of breath common Symptoms recorded from a total of 11,015 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 15,841 suspected COVID-19 cases, 15,846 possibly exposed patients (with a viral or respiratory illness), and 18,098 unexposed controls were included in the study. We found that increasing age, female sex, and severity of acute COVID-19 were associated with developing Long Covid. The authors wrote that the symptoms with the strongest associations with PCC were fatigue (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 3.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.87 to 4.17), shortness of breath (aHR 2.89; 95% CI, 2.48 to 3.36), palpitations (aHR 2.59; 95% CI, 1.86 to 3.60), and phlegm (aHR 2.43; 95% CI, 1.65 to 3.59). "Consistent with prior literature, we found that increasing age, female sex, and severity of acute COVID-19 were associated with developing Long Covid," the authors said. FDA releases new 5-year plan for veterinary antimicrobial stewardship News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship jetstream4wd / iStock The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today released an updated 5-year action plan for supporting antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary settings. The plan from the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) contains a series of actions organized under three goals: 1) Align antimicrobial drug product use with the principles of antimicrobial stewardship; 2) Foster antimicrobial stewardship on veterinary settings; 3) Enhance monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and use in animals. While the plan addresses antimicrobial use in all animals, the actions primarily target use of medically-important antibiotics in food-producing animals, who are treated with many of the same antibiotics used in human medicine. Although the FDA eliminated the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in livestock and poultry in 2017, critics say medically important antibiotics continue to be overused on US farms and that the agency has failed to curb inappropriate use. Enhanced data collection Among the goals for the 5-year period (2024 to 2028) are finalizing guidance for appropriate duration of use for antibiotics fed to food-producing animals. CVM also says it intends to facilitate the development and implementation of a sustainable system for collecting data on antibiotic use and resistance on US farms, and to publish more reports on those data. Although the agency currently collects antibiotic sales data, there is little data on how those drugs are used in food-producing animals. "Collecting and analyzing data on antimicrobial drug use in animals remains a critical gap to understand the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and its potential relationship to use of antimicrobials in animals," the plan states. Other goals in the plan include publishing a strategy for promoting antimicrobial stewardship in companion animals, collaborating with partners to characterize the diseases that are significant drivers of antibiotic use in food-animal production, encouraging research into antibiotic alternatives for food-producing animals, and completing a pilot national survey to establish baseline antimicrobial resistance data in aquatic ecosystems. "CVM remains committed to working collaboratively with interested stakeholders as we continue our efforts to mitigate the development of antimicrobial resistance and protect human and animal health," the agency said. Colorado reports fatal plague infection News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Plague Health officials in Colorado this week announced a fatal plague infection in a resident of Archuleta County, located in the southwest corner of the state. San Juan Basin Public Health (SJBPH) said an investigation is underway. It said it monitors prairie dog die-offs to track potential plague threats, and it urged area residents to report the sudden disappearance of active prairie dog colonies. "Residents should not eradicate or kill prairie dogs on their property as this increases the risk of exposure to plague-infested fleas," SJBPH said. Plague-infected rat flea. CDC / Dr. Pratt Colorado reports sporadic Yersinia pestis cases every year, and officials routinely urge people to take precautions, such as protecting pets from fleas and staying out of areas where wild rodents are found. In late June, Colorado reported a plague case in a patient from Montezuma County, also in the southwestern part of the state. COVID-19 third leading cause of death in Australia in 2022 News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 Last year, COVID-19 killed 9,859 Australians, behind only heart disease and dementia (including Alzheimer’s) as the leading causes of death in the country. Heart disease killed 18,643 Australians in 2022, and dementia killed 17,106. "An infectious disease (influenza and pneumonia) was last in the top 5 leading causes of death in 1970," the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in the press release. "Deaths due to COVID-19 were a significant contributor to the increase, causing just under 10,000 deaths and mentioned as a contributing factor on a further 2,782 death certificates. The Omicron variant was the dominant strain during 2022, with multiple waves across the year associated with the variant." The Omicron variant was the dominant strain during 2022, with multiple waves across the year associated with the variant. The government said the rate of death from COVID-19 had increased to 27.1 deaths per 100,000 people, compared to 24.5 in 2020. An aging population contributed to the increased COVID-19 deaths, as the median age of citizens who died from COVID-19 in 2022 was 85.8 years. COVID-19 was not the only respiratory virus to see a jump in deaths: 305 people died from influenza in 2022. This contrasts with 2 people in 2021, the lowest number of annual flu deaths on record.

This year it is possible to be vaccinated with an adapted COVID-19 vaccine and the influenza vaccine at the same time and thus obtain immune protection against both viral diseases. Source: Ulrike Leone/Pixabay.com As of late September 2023, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut had already released over 20 million doses of influenza vaccine. Seasonal Strain Update Was Completed Early for 2023/2024 Influenza viruses are constantly changing. Different influenza virus subtypes circulate in the population during each influenza season. This means that the antigens in the influenza vaccines need to be adapted each year to the expected circulating virus variants (known as the seasonal strain update) in order to ensure protection against influenza. The World Health Organization (WHO) makes annual recommendations for influenza vaccine composition. Those recommendations form the basis for the influenza vaccine strain adjustment for the upcoming influenza vaccination season in the northern hemisphere. The WHO recommendations are based on observations of influenza virus variant circulation in the southern hemisphere, where the influenza season takes place half a year before our season in the northern hemisphere. With the participation of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) confirms the WHO’s recommendations, which makes them binding for the EU. For the influenza season 2023/2024, there are nine tetravalent (containing four antigens of different influenza virus variants) influenza vaccine products that will be available for use in Germany having completed the approved seasonal strain update. This is the same amount of vaccines as were available in the previous season. Influenza Vaccines for Different Age Groups Most flu vaccines are authorised for individuals from six months or two years of age. However, there are also vaccine products that have been specially developed for certain age groups. Examples are the high-dose vaccine and the vaccine with an adjuvant for the elderly as well as the live attenuated vaccine for children and adolescents, which was developed as a nasal spray. Tetravalent Seasonal Influenza Vaccines (with seasonal strain update for the influenza season 2023/2024) Afluria Tetra 2023/2024 (18 years and older)Efluelda 2023/2024 (high-dose vaccine with 60 instead of 15 micrograms HA/strain, adults 60 years and older)Fluad Tetra 2023/2024 (vaccine with adjuvant, adults 65 years and older)Flucelvax Tetra 2023/2024 (cell culture vaccine, two years and older)Fluenz Tetra 2023/2024 (nasal vaccine, live attenuated, from two years up to and including 17 years)Influsplit Tetra 2023/2024 (six months and older)Influvac Tetra 2023/2024 (six months and older)Vaxigrip Tetra 2023/2024 (six months and older)Xanaflu Tetra 2023/2024 (six months and older) High Quality Through Batch Testing Federal batch testing by an Official Medicines Control Laboratory (OMCL), such as the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, is required by law for all vaccines used in Germany. Randomly selected doses (test samples) of each batch (production unit) of each influenza vaccine product are tested by the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut or an OMCL in another European country. Experts check the manufacturing documents as well as the results of the manufacturer's quality control examinations to ensure the high quality of each batch of influenza vaccines. The Paul-Ehrlich-Institut will only grant federal batch release for Germany if the quality criteria specified in each vaccine product's marketing authorisation have been met and all specifications have been complied with. Federal batch release for Germany is always issued by the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut.

Here we defined CD8+ T cell immunity directed at the prominent influenza epitope HLA-A*02:01-M158–66 (A2/M158) across four age groups at phenotypic, transcriptomic, clonal and functional levels. We identify a linear differentiation trajectory from newborns to children then adults, followed by divergence and a clonal reset in older adults. Gene profiles in older adults closely resemble those of newborns and children, despite being clonally distinct. Only child-derived and adult-derived A2/M158+CD8+ T cells had the potential to differentiate into highly cytotoxic epitope-specific CD8+ T cells, which was linked to highly functional public T cell receptor (TCR)αβ signatures. Suboptimal TCRαβ signatures in older adults led to less proliferation, polyfunctionality, avidity and recognition of peptide mutants, although displayed no signs of exhaustion. These data suggest that priming T cells at different stages of life might greatly affect CD8+ T cell responses toward viral infections.

CD8+ T cells recognize epitopes, peptides (p) bound to HLA class I (pHLA-I) on the surfaces of infected cells via TCRαβ. Memory CD8+ T cells recognize conserved viral peptides, providing broad-protection against mutating viruses and ameliorate disease severity1,2. Epitope-specific CD8+ T cells in adults are well studied, but less so in newborns, children and older adults. To rationally design effective CD8+ T cell-targeted immunotherapies and vaccines for all ages, we need to understand how epitope-specific CD8+ T cells evolve across human life.Diversity and clonal composition of TCR repertoires affect T cell functionality and antiviral protection5,6,7. Limited data exist on how age-related TCR changes affect magnitude, functionality and gene profiles of epitope-specific T cells. Previous age-specific TCR studies were mostly based on bulk, rather than epitope-specific T cells and/or in vitro-expanded T cell lines, and encompassed bulk sequenced TCRα or TCRβ chains, instead of paired TCRαβ. Bulk naive TCR repertoires at birth are highly diverse, lack clonal expansions and nucleotide insertions in complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) regions8,9. Similar trends were observed for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Melan-A/MART-1-specific CD8+ T cells8,10. Newborn influenza A2/M158-specific TCRβ repertoires were biased toward TRBV19, which persisted into adulthood10,11. Childhood infections clonally expand virus-specific T cells, further maintained in adults4,8,10,12,13. With age, bulk and epitope-specific TCR repertoires showed declining TCR diversity, fewer non-N-inserted clonotypes and longer CDR3α sequences8,9,14,15,16. Aging compromised T cell immunity, including increased terminally differentiated T (TEMRA) cells, decreased naive T cells and T cell functionality8,12,17,18,19,20,21, resulting in diminished recall capacity22,23. These changes are defined as immunosenescence24,25.Ex vivo epitope-specific, single-cell paired TCRαβ analyses across age groups remain rare and were performed by us for influenza-specific16 and SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells13; however, not across the human lifespan. Highly functional public (shared) clonotypes dominated adult A2/M158-specific TCRαβ repertoires16,26,27, whereas older adults had prominent private clonotypes (not shared)16. Children had fewer expanded SARS-CoV-2-specific clonotypes compared to adults, despite common TCRαβ motifs13. Underlying mechanisms and functional consequences of age-related changes within epitope-specific TCR repertoire across the human lifespan remain unresolved. Limited epitope-specific T cell single-cell RNA-sequence (scRNA-seq) studies focus on adult versus older bulk T lymphocytes in healthy individuals28,29 or those with COVID-19 (ref. 30), but not across the human lifespan.We defined epitope-specific CD8+ T cell immunity across the human lifespan ex vivo in newborns, children, adults and older adults. We incorporated single-cell transcriptome and paired TCRαβ analyses to define epitope-specific T cells directed at the prominent and conserved HLA-A*02:01-restricted M158–66 peptide derived from influenza A viruses (A2/M158) (refs. 11,16,31,32,33). Public clonotypes present across different individuals16,26,27,34 allowed us to track numerical, phenotypic, functional and molecular changes within public A2/M158+CD8+ TCRαβ clonotypes across human lifespan. We identified age-related TCR repertoire shifts within older epitope-specific CD8+ T cells, stemming from newborn/child-like molecular signatures detected in older adults. Our findings have implications for rationally designed T cell-targeted vaccines and immunotherapies across age groups.ResultsLifespan HLA-A*02:01+ cohortFor our ‘lifespan’ cohort, we recruited healthy HLA-A*02:01-expressing individuals across four immunologically distinct age groups: newborns (n = 11, 0 years), children (n = 12; median 9 years, range 3–16), adults (n = 20; median 37 years, range 18–58) and older adults (n = 18; median 72 years, range 63–88) (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1). We performed ex vivo phenotypic, transcriptome, functional and TCRαβ repertoire analyses of A2/M158-specific CD8+ T cells.Fig. 1: Age-related changes in A2/M158+CD8+ T cell frequencies and phenotypes.a, ‘Lifespan’ HLA-A*02:01-positive cohort, median age and number of donors per age category. b, Age distribution within the HLA-A*02:01-expressing lifespan cohort. c, Representative FACS panels and gating strategy for A2/M158+CD8+ T cells in the enriched fraction and phenotypic populations TCM (CD27+CD45RA−) cells, TEM (CD27−CD45RA−), TEMRA (CD27-CD45RA+), Tnaive (CD27+CD45RA+CD95−) and TSCM (CD27+CD45RA+CD95+) cells.

P values are indicated above the graphs. N, newborn; C, children; A, adult; OA, older adult.Source dataFull size imageA2/M158 +CD8+ T cells frequencies peak in adultsMagnitude and phenotype of CD8+ T cells and A2/M158+CD8+ T cells were assessed ex vivo using tetramer-associated-magnetic enrichment (TAME) (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Frequency of total CD8+ T cells was lowest in newborns (median 15.7%), increased in children (21.5%), peaked in adults (21.9%) and bimodal frequencies were found in older adults (19.1%) (Fig. 1d,e). A2/M158+CD8+ T cell frequencies were lowest in newborns (median 5.34 × 10−5) and children (7.43 × 10−5), peaked in adults (2.33 × 10−4) and decreased in older adults (7.36 × 10−5) (Fig. 1f,g), aligning with reports of declining total CD8+ T cells17 and A2/M158+CD8+ T cells16 in immunosenescent older adults.Age-related phenotypic changes in A2/M158 +CD8+ T cellsEx vivo epitope-specific A2/M158+CD8+ T cells and total CD8+ T cells displayed different phenotype profiles (Fig. 1c,h–m and Extended Data Fig. 1a–d). Naive A2/M158+CD8+ T (Tnaive) cells (CD27+CD45RA+CD95−) decreased with age, newborns (median 98.5%), children (20.4%), adults (6.5%) and older adults (3.2%). Notably, 37.5% of older adults maintained substantial A2/M158+CD8+ Tnaive cells (>10%). A2/M158+CD8+ central memory T (TCM) cells (CD27+CD45RA−) peaked in adults (80.7%). Children and older adults displayed bimodal A2/M158+CD8+ TCM cell profiles, potentially reflecting influenza exposures in children. A2/M158+CD8+ effector memory T (TEM) cell (CD27−CD45RA−) and stem cell memory (TSCM) cell (CD27+CD45RA+CD95+) populations were low across age groups (<10%). Notably, A2/M1+CD8+ TEMRA (CD27−CD45RA+) cells remained low across age groups (<10%), conversely to increasing TEMRA levels within total CD8+ T cells in older adults. Ample TEMRA populations are characteristic for immunosenescence in older adults experiencing chronic CMV infections12,17. Similar trends were observed for absolute numbers of A2/M158+phenotype+cells/106 CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b).CD57 expression, associated with immunosenescence and terminal differentiation18,35,36, on total CD8+ T cells peaked in older adults (60.8%) (Fig. 1j), but remained low on A2/M158+CD8+ T cells across age groups (6.7%; 7 CD57+A2/M158+CD8+ T cells/106CD8+ T cells), including older adults (8.3%; 14 CD57+A2/M158+CD8+ T cells/106CD8+ T cells) (Fig. 1k and Extended Data Fig. 1d). PD-1 expression, an immune checkpoint marker that can be associated with TCR activation, immunosuppression and/or exhaustion37, was low on total CD8+ T cells across ages (14.5%) (Fig. 1l), whereas PD-1+A2/M158+CD8+ T cell frequencies were high in children (54.4%; 37 PD-1+A2/M158+CD8+ T cells/106CD8+ T cells) and adults (57.5%; 138 PD-1+A2/M158+CD8+ T cells/106CD8+ T cells), and decreased below 50% in 68.8% of older adults (41 PD-1+A2/M158+CD8+ T cells/106CD8+ T cells) (Fig. 1m and Extended Data Fig. 1d). CD57/PD-1 and CD38/HLA-DR coexpression was minimal (Extended Data Fig. 1c–f).CMV testing would reveal whether CMV status affects total CD8+ and/or A2/M158-specific CD8+ T cell phenotypes (Supplementary Table 1). Although our dataset was underpowered, A2/M158-specific CD8+ T cell responses were not modulated by concurrent CMV infection, conversely to total CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 2).Overall, A2/M158-specific CD8+ T cell phenotypes change across the human lifespan, but these changes are distinct from total CD8+ T cells, with absence of terminally differentiated A2/M158+CD8+ T cells in older adults.Four A2/M158 +CD8+ T cell clusters across human lifespanWe defined molecular gene signatures in healthy HLA-A*02:01-expressing newborns, children, adults and older adults (n = 3 per group), selected to reflect phenotypic heterogeneity, including dispersion of heterogenicity within TCM and Tnaive populations in children and older adults, and lack of TEMRA in older adults (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Ex vivo-isolated A2/M158+CD8+ T cells were index-sorted for single-cell transcriptome analysis. A total of 793 cells across all age groups passed quality control for analyses.Unsupervised dimensionality reduction analysis using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) maps revealed four distinct A2/M158+CD8+ T cell clusters (Fig. 2a). Newborns were predominantly detected in clusters 1 and 2, mainly containing naive cells. Memory A2/M158+CD8+ T cells dominated cluster 0 encompassed children, adults and older adults, whereas adults dominated cluster 3 (Fig. 2a,b).Fig. 2: Molecular differentiation of A2/M158+CD8+ T cells across human lifespan.a, Dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and clustering of scRNA-seq data colored by clusters (top left), age groups (top middle), phenotype (top right), TCR features (bottom left) and clone size (bottom right). b, Distribution of age (left) and phenotype (right) in each UMAP cluster. Single-cell phenotypes were obtained via index-sorting protein expression data. c,d, Selected genes identified from differential expression analysis between A2/M158+CD8+ T cells in each UMAP cluster (c) or between A2/M158+CD8+T cells grouped by age (d) using pairwise comparison with a two-side hurdle model (MAST) without correction for multiple comparison (P < 0.05). Dot size represents the proportion of cells with non-zero expression. e, Comparison of exhaustion gene expression levels between A2/M158+CD8+ T cells grouped by their age, three donors per age group with n = 174 single A2/M158+CD8+ T cells from newborns, n = 219 from children, n = 261 from adults and n = 139 from older adults. Pairwise group comparisons were performed with two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Bonferroni-adjusted P values are reported (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001). N, newborn; C, children; A, adult; OA, older adult.Full size imageGene expression profiles in each cluster were consistent with protein-expressed phenotypic profiles obtained from index-sort analysis (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3b). Clusters 1 and 2, containing mostly naive cells from newborns, expressed SELL, CCR7 and transcription factors TCF7 and SOX4, hallmark genes for naive T cells. Cluster 2 expressed higher CD69, FOS and STAT3 levels, indicating increased activation and TCR signaling compared to cluster 1. Cluster 0 consisted of A2/M158+CD8+ T cells expressing effector and memory markers, including GZMK, CCL5, CXCR4, CD28 (Fig. 2c) and transcription factors NR4A2, KLF2, FOS and JUN. A2/M158+CD8+ T cells in cluster 3 expressed cytotoxicity-associated genes, GZMA, PRF1, NKG7 and KLRD1, with high expression of TRAV27/TRBV19 gene segments. Cluster properties were confirmed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; Extended Data Fig. 3c).TRBV19 and TRAV27 represent key features of optimal A2/M158+CD8+ T cells, especially with arginine (R) and serine (S) in CDR3β (refs. 26,27,38). Full-length paired TRAV27-TRBV19-CDR3-RS clonotypes and (TRBV19-)CDR3-RS clonotypes paired to different/unknown TCRα chains were identified mostly within clusters 0 and 3, confirming segregation of clonally expanded A2/M158+CD8+ T cells with varying functional gene features (Fig. 2a,c). TRBV27, uncommon in memory A2/M158+CD8+ T cells, was enriched in cluster 2 (Fig. 2c). UMAP analysis excluding TCR genes revealed a similar four-cluster composition, indicating that clonally expanded A2/M158+CD8+ T cells did not alter cluster compositions (Extended Data Fig. 3d).Overall, scRNA-seq combined with protein expression phenotypes revealed differential molecular signatures of A2/M158+CD8+ T cells across four clusters, reflecting different age groups, separating naive A2/M158+CD8+ T cells associated with newborns and effector/memory A2/M158+CD8+ T cells mostly found in other age groups.Young gene profiles resemble gene profiles for older adultsTo identify age group-distinctive gene signatures, we performed differential gene expression analysis between cells stratified by age and investigated heterogenicity within A2/M158+CD8+ T cells in children and older adults, and lack of exhaustion and terminal differentiation in older A2/M158+CD8+ T cells.Newborn A2/M158+CD8+ T cells expressed naive gene signatures, with high expression of CCR7, SELL and TNFAIP3, which became less prominent in children and adults, but increased in older adults. Adult A2/M158+CD8+ T cells expressed effector-memory phenotype profiles, including LITAF, KLRG1, CXCR4 (contributing to homeostasis self-renewal and homing)39 and NK-like signatures, KLRK1 encoding NKG2D (involved in stress-induced cytotoxic response)40, less prominent in children and older adults (Fig. 2d). Mixed naive/memory phenotypes in children and older adults (Fig. 1i) were verified by shared mixed gene expression profiles (Fig. 2d).Cytotoxic gene signatures, ITGB1, GNLY, CST7, GZMA, PRF1 and GZMK, detected in children, became more pronounced in adults, reflecting their TCM/TEM phenotype. Conversely, older adults had lower expression of cytotoxicity genes, despite substantial A2/M158+CD8+ TCM populations, suggesting that older A2/M158+CD8+ T cells are less cytotoxic. Newborns uniquely expressed LTB (encoding TNF-C), but no other cytotoxic genes (Fig. 2d). GSEA between age groups confirmed predominant cytotoxic-effector/memory signatures in children and adults, and revealed enriched naive signatures in newborn and older adults, largely driven by reduced effector and differentiated states of A2/M158+CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3e).Newborn A2/M158+CD8+ T cells expressed high levels of ZFP36L1 and PIK3IP, reflective of quiescent naive T cells. High PIK3IP1 expression in older adults corresponded to heterogeneity within older A2/M158+CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2d). Markers associated with maintaining immune control (FYN and LYAR), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10RA) and controlling T cell differentiation (ZFP36 and TXNIP) were highly expressed in adult A2/M158+CD8+ T cells, less pronounced in children and older adults and absent in newborns. CD37, inhibiting TCR signaling41, was uniquely expressed in older A2/M158+CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2d).Transcription factors associated with naive or resting T memory phenotypes (FOXP1, TCF7, SOX4 and LEF1) were highly expressed in newborns, whereas adults expressed ID2, associated with terminal differentiation42 (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Older adults expressed AP-1 transcription factors FOS, JUNB and KLF2, associated with protection from exhaustion43, (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Exhaustion-associated transcription factors (TOX), exhaustion markers (TIGIT, CTLA4, LAG3 and PDCD1) and senescence marker CD57 (B3GAT1) were minimally expressed across age groups, supporting phenotypic data (Fig. 2d,e and Extended Data Fig. 3f). Pairwise comparison of children and older adult gene profiles revealed that older A2/M158+CD8+ T cells had more heterogenous distribution, with less-differentiated and cytotoxic subsets (Extended Data Fig. 3g). Gene profiles of older adults were more like newborns, whereas children and adult A2/M158+CD8+ T cells had increased effector and cytotoxicity signatures.As TCR signatures are important in antiviral immune responses, we investigated TCR-associated genes across age groups. TRBV19 and TRAV27 gene expression, key features of highly functional A2/M158+CD8+ T cells26,27,38, increased from children to adults, whereas TRBV27 expression was higher in newborns and older adults (Fig. 2d). Age-specific TCR changes suggest potential shifts in dominance of key TCR clonotypes across the human lifespan.Overall, differentially expressed gene profiles across the human lifespan revealed clear distinctions between naive A2/M158+CD8+ T cells in newborns, mixed naive/memory profiles in children, cytotoxic-effector-memory profiles in adults and inversion toward naive profiles in older adults, without evidence for exhaustion and terminal differentiation, agreeing with phenotypic data (Fig. 1i–m).Age-specific molecular changes stem from distinct clonotypesUMAP analysis demonstrated heterogeneity among A2/M158+CD8+ T cells, with clusters segregating cells based on age group and phenotype, with newborn and older adults sharing common gene and phenotypic signatures (Fig. 2). We thus asked whether distinct lineages can explain molecular and phenotypic differences observed across the human lifespan. We hypothesized two scenarios (1) A2/M158-specific TCR clonotypes are shared between children, adults and older adults, with older TCR clonotypes reverting to a quiescent gene profile similar to newborns and children; and (2) older adults have distinct A2/M158-specific TCR clonotypes compared to adults, with gene expression profiles similar to those detected in newborn and children. To evaluate the relationship between differentiation and fate of the clonal lineage of A2/M158+CD8+ T cells across age groups, we performed pseudotime trajectory analysis using partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) based on gene expression data, combined with clonotype information to infer the connections and order of differentiation throughout T cell states (Fig. 3).Fig. 3: Single-cell transcriptomics shows evolutionary trajectory across human life.a, PAGA analysis of single cells (n = 793) identified five clusters (left) and their relative connectivity (middle) and colored based on the four UMAP clusters (right). b, PAGA analysis colored by age (left), phenotype (right).

Loess curves represent the changes along the trajectories of age groups (top left), phenotype based on protein expression (top right), TCR features (middle) and the dot-plot shows expression values of selected genes measured via scaled mean expression along the pseudotime size of the dots corresponds to the percentage of cells expressing the gene in the given pseudotime state (bottom). Colored lines are a Loess fit, with error bands shaded in matching colors representing the 95% CI (d, bottom left). N, newborn; C, children; A, adult; OA, older adult.Full size imageSimilar to UMAP, PAGA analysis confirmed that A2/M158+CD8+ T cells separate into clusters based on age group and phenotype with additional segregation of newborns and older adults into two distinct clusters, clusters 3 and 4 (Fig. 3a,b). TCR mapping identified highly functional TRAV27-TRBV19-CDR3-RS TCR features dominated cluster 0 and 2, whereas TRBV27-expressing clonotypes dominated the older adult cluster 4 (Fig. 3c).We established the A2/M158+CD8+ T cell pseudotime trajectory across five PAGA clusters. Each cell was assigned a state based on dimensionality reduction or clustering in PAGA. Pseudotime values were inferred for each cell, allowing cells to be ordered along a trajectory across which they can be considered as proxy of cell lineage differentiation (Fig. 3d). Cluster 3, consisting of predominantly naive T cells from newborns, was the logical choice for the differentiation root (Fig. 3b,d). A trajectory was identified by connecting root cluster 3 with clusters 1 and 0, and terminating in cluster 2 (trajectory 1) (Fig. 3a). This trajectory largely correlated with clonal expansion and increased usage of TRAV27-TRBV19-CDR3-RS features (Fig. 3c). Older TRBV27-expressing A2/M158+CD8+ T cells dominating cluster 4 (Fig. 3c), suggested deviation, branching off from cluster 0 and terminating in cluster 4 (trajectory 2), indicating distinct lineage differentiation in older adults.To quantify variation of gene and phenotypic signatures along the pseudotime (Fig. 3d), we performed Loess smoothing fit. T cell phenotype analysis showed rapid declining growth rates of naive A2/M158+CD8+ T cells along the pseudotime, whereas growth rates of TCM and TEM A2/M158+CD8+ T cells increased, the latter largely consisting of cytotoxic effectors from adults displaying TRBV19-CDR3-RS features (Fig. 3a–c). Indeed, gene expression analysis demonstrated a rapid increase of TRAV27 and TRBV19, along with NKG7, GNLY and GZMA expression, representing increased cytotoxicity profiles along trajectory 1. Conversely, naive-associated genes, including CD27 and transcription factors FOS and JUNB declined over the pseudotime, whereas TCR signaling genes (LCK) remained highly expressed.Overall, our trajectory analysis demonstrated nonlinear differentiation of A2/M158+CD8+ T cells across the human lifespan. Trajectory 1 consisted of newborns, children and adults along a differentiation branch toward the effector cytotoxic A2/M158+CD8+ T cells associated with optimal TCR features dominating adult A2/M158+CD8+ repertoires. Trajectory 2 was dominated by older less-differentiated T cells, encompassing a distinct clonal lineage.Diverse TCRαβ repertoires in newborns and older adultsTCRαβ repertoire diversity and clonal composition affect functionality of CD8+ T cells5,6,7. As transcriptomic analyses revealed prominent TRAV27/TRBV19 expression in children and adults, and TRBV27 in newborns and older adults (Fig. 3c), we asked whether TCRαβ signatures underly age-specific gene profiles. We dissected TCRαβ clonal diversity and composition ex vivo within HLA−A*02:01-expressing newborns (n = 6), children (n = 12), adults (n = 8) and older adults (n = 10) (Figs. 4–6 and Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5). We analyzed 1,110 paired A2/M158+CD8+ TCRαβ clonotypes, 66 single TCR α-chains, 447 single TCR β-chains, with unidentifiable matching TCR β-chains or TCR α-chains, respectively (Supplementary Table 2).Fig. 4: Age-related changes in A2/M158+CD8+ TCRαβ repertoire.a–e, A2/M158+CD8+ T cells were enriched by TAME followed by single-cell sorting for TCRαβ analysis. a, A 2D kernel principal-component analysis (PCA) projection of the A2/M158+CD8+ TCR landscape colored by Vα, Jα, Vβ and Jβ gene usage (left to right) for all four age groups generated by TCRdist.

Statistical analysis of Pgen and for the number of insertions and deletions between age groups utilized a two-sided mixed-effects model with donor encoded as a random effect, as described in Methods. P values were adjusted (Padj) for multiple testing with the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method. N, newborn; C, children; A, adult; OA, older adult.Source dataFull size imageGene segment usage and gene–gene pairing landscapes were generated for pooled TCRαβ repertoires within each group (Fig. 4a–c). Two-dimensional (2D)-kernel principal-component analysis (kPCA) projection of TCR Vα/Vβ/Jα/Jβ gene segments demonstrated diverse TCR repertoires in newborns, clustering in children and adults, before diversifying in older adults (Fig. 4a). TCR diversity scores (TCRdiv) for A2/M158+CD8+ demonstrated that both TCR α-chains and β-chains contributed to initial clustering from newborns to adults, and subsequent diversification in older adults (Fig. 4b). Non-newborn TCR repertoires showed more heterogeneity across individuals than within individuals, but not in newborns despite higher repertoire diversity (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To measure density within age-specific TCR repertoires and quantify relative contributions of clustered and diverged TCRs, neighbor distance distributions were calculated, where lower average values of distance distribution peaks represented similar clonotype clustering (Fig. 4c). Bimodal distribution of single and paired TCRαβ sequences was observed across age groups, except for newborn single-TCRα sequences, characterized by a single high distribution peak (average newborns αβ, 192.3; β, 70.9; α, 91.4; children αβ, 149.0; β, 49.6; α, 77.4; adults αβ, 103.1; β, 28.4; α, 59.0; older adults αβ, 161.3; β, 57.9; α, 80.8) (Fig. 4c).Overall, A2/M158+CD8+ TCRαβ repertoires are highly diverse in newborns, greatly cluster in children and adults, before diversifying in older adults. These changes are attributed to both TCR α-chains and β-chains.Young public TCRs replaced by private TCRs in older adultsCircos analysis of pooled TRAV and TRBV sequences was performed to understand how changes in TCRαβ diversity related to gene segment usage (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 4b). Newborn A2/M158+CD8+ TCRαβ repertoires were highly diverse, although newborns expressed TRBV19 bias10,11. Clonally expanded TRBV19-expressing TCRs became more prevalent in children and adults. Strong TRAV27–TRBV19 associations were observed in children (10 out of 12 children, 82 out of 714 TCRαβ clonotypes) and became more pronounced in adults (8 out of 8 adults, 96 out of 409 TCRαβ clonotypes). Consistent with kPCA and neighbor distance distribution analyses, higher TRAV and TRBV diversity was observed among older adults. TRBV19 became less prevalent in six out of ten older adults and the TRBV19–TRAV27 association was observed in four out of ten older donors (33 out of 409 TCRαβ clonotypes). Instead, older adults displayed large clonal expansions expressing other TRAV and TRBV gene segments.We defined distribution of high-prevalent public (shared clonotypes, detected at least twice within each individual), low-prevalent public (shared clonotypes, detected only once within each individual) and high-prevalent private clonotypes (not shared, detected at least twice in a single individual). High-prevalent public TCRαβ clonotypes were observed during childhood, peaked in adults, before decreasing in older adults, particularly the previously identified full public TCRαβ clonotype (TRAV27/TRAJ42, CDR3α-GAGGGSQGNLIF, TRBV19/TRBV2–7 and CDR3β-CASSIRSSYEQYF) associated with optimal immunity in adults16,26,27,34 (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 4c). Loss of public TCRαβ clonotypes in older adults was associated with increased prevalence of private TCR clonotypes (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 4d).Our data suggest that repeated influenza virus exposures expand public TCRαβ clonotypes in children and adults, which are replaced by private TCRαβ clonal expansions in older adults.Young public CDR3αβ-motifs are less frequent in older adultsAs hypervariable CDR3α and CDR3β regions predominantly mediate fine pHLA-I specificity, we dissected CDR3αβ regions by analyzing length and amino acid sequence to identify TCR motifs. Conversely to diverse lengths observed for A2/M158+CD8+ CDR3α regions across age groups, newborn CDR3β sequences were predominantly 8–10 amino acids in length, whereas an eight-amino acid length dominated in children, adults and older adults (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Table 2).We identified CDR3 motif similarities to highlight key conserved residues driving A2/M158-specific TCR recognition either within or between age groups. No CDR3α motif was identified in newborns, attributed to high TCR α-chain diversity. A single top-scoring, TRAV27-TRAJ42-associated, glycine-rich, CDR3α-(CA)GGGSQG(NLI) motif was identified in children, adults and older adults (Fig. 5a). A single glycine was enriched above background levels, suggesting limited involvement in specific pHLA interaction44. Clonotypes expressing the full public TRAV27-TRAJ42-associated CDR3α-GAGGGGSQGNLIF or shorter variants, including GGGSQG, GGG or GG were shared between age groups with frequencies increasing in children, peaking in adults and decreasing in older adults (Fig. 5b,c), confirming our finding that TCRα chains contributed to diversifying the older TCR repertoire (Fig. 4b).Several top-scoring (chi-squared ≥ 100) CDR3β-motifs were identified within age groups (Fig. 5a). TRBV19-associated CDR3β-‘IV’-motifs were uniquely identified in three out of five newborns. Generally, ‘IV’-expressing CDR3β clonotypes were detected at a low frequency in children, adults and older adults, except in child TN022. No ‘IV’-expressing clonotypes were shared between age groups (Fig. 5d,e and Supplementary Table 2).A2/M158-specific TRBV19-TRBJ2-7-associated CDR3β-‘RS’ motifs were prominent in children, adults and older adults (Fig. 5a). CDR3β-‘RS’-expressing TCRαβs were frequently shared between individuals across age groups (Fig. 5d). Enriched ‘RS’ residues are essential for the peg-notch mode of recognition, interacting extensively with the M158–66 peptide and HLA-A*02:01 molecule26,27,38,44,45,46. High-frequency CDR3-‘RS’-expressing clonal expansions were observed in children, peaked in adults and decreased in 80% of older adults (Fig. 5d,e). Changes in ‘RS’-expressing clonotypes were partially attributed to the public TRAV27/TRAJ42-CDR3α-GAGGGSQGNLIF; TRBV19/TRBV2-7-CDR3β-CASSIRSSYEQYF clonotype (Figs. 4e and 5d).TRBV19-TRBJ1-2-associated (C)ASSIGxxYGYT(F) CDR3β-motifs harboring ‘IG’ and ‘YGY’ residues was among the top-scoring CDR3β motifs in children and adults (Fig. 5a). Although TCRs expressing CDR3β-‘IG’ and/or ‘YGY’ were detected across age groups, only those coexpressing ‘IG’ and ‘YGY’ were shared between children, adults and older adults, but were absent in newborns (Fig. 5d,e).Both children and older adults expressed less-prominent CDR3β-‘IY’-motifs with highest frequencies in children (Fig. 5a,e). ‘IY’-expressing CDR3β motifs were associated with TRBV19 and variable TRBJ gene usage, resulting in limited sharing among age groups (Fig. 5a,d). CDR3β-‘(I)F’-motif expressing clonotypes were identified in newborns, children and older adults, and were associated with TRBV19, TRBV27 and variable TRBJ segments (Fig. 5a,e). Despite strong enrichment of the ‘F’ residue, CDR3β-(I)F-expressing clonotypes were detected at low frequencies and were not shared between age groups, with the exception of DMC19 dominated by the highly frequent CDR3β-‘F’-expressing clonotype (71.9%) (Fig. 5d,e and Supplementary Table 2).Overall, we identified public-associated CDR3α and CDR3β motifs, with CDR3α ‘GGGSQG’ and CDR3β-‘RS’ motifs being most prominent. Public-associated CDR3α and CDR3β motifs became less frequent in older adults and were replaced with high-frequency private CDR3 motifs uniquely identified in a single individual.Public datasets verify age-related changes public TCR motifsTo validate that A2/M158+CD8+ public-associated TCR CDR3β motifs decline in older adults, we utilized two independent large publicly available bulk TCRβ repertoire datasets from donors aged 0–103 years8,47 (n = 79 and n = 673; donors with known ages were analyzed). RS, IG, YGY and IY CDR3β-motifs were enriched in HLA-A*2+ donors compared to HLA-A*2-negative donors, but not IF and IV CDR3β motifs (Fig. 6a). Similar to our ‘lifespan’ cohort, we observed that A2/M158+CD8+ public-associated CDR3β motifs were differentially expressed across different HLA-A*2+ age groups (Fig. 6b). RS, IG, YGY and IY CDR3β motifs were depleted in older adults, especially in individuals >80 years old. ‘RS’ motifs were less prevalent in young children (0–9 years) compared to adults (20–39 years) (Fig. 6b).Thus, our observations of age-dependent prevalence of public-associated CDR3β motifs were confirmed in independent large cohorts of aging donors.Higher probability of generation underpins public TCRsTo understand why A2/M158+CD8+ public clonotypes were prominent in children and adults, and declined in older adults, we estimated the probability of generation (Pgen) of A2/M158+CD8+ TCR α-chains and β-chains using TCRdist44. Larger Pgen values are associated with easier-to-generate clonotypes, whereas smaller Pgen values indicate harder-to-generate (rarer) clonotypes.TCR α-chain Pgen values were similar for all ages (Fig. 6c). Significantly greater Pgen values were observed within adult TCR β-chains compared to children and older adults (Fig. 6d), supported by fewer inferred TCRβ N insertions in adult A2/M158-specific TCR β-chains (Fig. 6e). The number of inferred exonuclease deletions were similar across age groups (Fig. 6f), suggesting that relatively easy-to-generate TCR β-chain formation in adults may be driven by reduced terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) activity during V(D)J recombination following early childhood. Indeed, TdT expression decreases between birth and adulthood48,49, coinciding with increased public A2/M158+CD8+ cells after childhood.Overall, adult TRBV19-expressing clonotypes had a larger Pgen compared to children and older adults, likely driven by expanded full public clonotypes. Child and adult public-associated TRBV19-expressing clonotypes had larger Pgen values compared to other TRBV-expressing clonotypes (Fig. 6g). Conversely, highly prevalent non-TRBV19-expressing TCR clonotypes in children and older adults had significantly lower Pgen values compared to newborns (Fig. 6g). Patterns for total TCR clonotypes were complemented by TCR logo analyses depicting V and J gene frequencies, CDR3 amino acid sequences and inferred rearrangement structures of grouped TCRs (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). TCR clusters expressing public-associated CDR3α-‘(G)GGSQG’ or CDR3β-‘RS’ and -‘IG’ had higher probabilities of generation in children, adults and older adults (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). TCR clusters expressing private-associated CDR3β-‘(I)F’ had lower probability of TCR recombination (Extended Data Fig. 5d).Overall, child and adult A2/M158+CD8+ TCRs, often expressing TRBV19 public-associated CDR3α-‘GGGSQG’ and/or CDR3β-‘RS’ motifs, are easier to generate, explaining why they are shared between HLA-A*02:01-expressing individuals. Conversely, large clonal expansions in older adults, often associated with non-TRBV19 non-public CDR3α and/or CDR3β sequences, with increased numbers of insertions and deletions, are harder to generate and less likely to be shared.Public clonotypes underpin A2/M158 +CD8+ T cell proliferationTo understand whether age-related changes in TCRαβs have functional consequences, we assessed proliferation linked to clonal composition of A2/M158+CD8+ T cells across age groups (n = 3–4 per group), following in vitro stimulation with the M158–88 peptide (Fig. 7, Extended Data Figs. 6 and 7, Supplementary Movie and Supplementary Table 3). Proliferation was observed by day 3–4, particularly in children and adults and associated with stronger proliferation capacity, resulting in higher A2/M158+CD8+ T cell numbers compared to older adults and newborns (Fig. 7a–c). Except older adult BP114, who had the largest fold change on day 10 despite low cell numbers, reflecting their TCM cell phenotype at day 0 (Fig. 7a,b and Extended Data Fig. 7a). Newborn A2/M158+CD8+ T cells had low proliferation capacity, reflecting their naive phenotype (Fig. 7b and Extended Data Fig. 7a). Fluctuation in fold change originated from high diversity in newborn TCRαβ repertoires, resulting in diverse TRBV and TRAV signatures in proliferating A2/M158+CD8+ TCR clonotypes (Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 3). Proliferating TCRs of other groups were dominated by TRBV19-expressing clonotypes paired with variable TRBJ, TRAV and TRAJ gene segments, resulting in TCRαβ repertoire diversity, except for DMC3 (Supplementary Table 3).Fig. 7: Proliferation and polyfunctionality of A2/M158+CD8+ T cells across human life.a,b, Total numbers (a) and fold increase (b) of A2/M158-tetramer+CD8+ T cells from day 0 (ex vivo tetramer enrichment, due to low frequency), day 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 following in vitro M158–66 peptide stimulation of newborn, child, adult and older adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (no previous enrichment). c, Representative FACS plots indicating the gating strategy used to characterize dividing (red) and undivided (blue) A2/M158+CD8+ T cells by the loss of cell trace violet over a 10-d expansion of representative donors.

N, newborn; C, children; A, adult; OA, older adult.Source dataFull size imageProliferating A2/M158+CD8+CDR3 motifs reflected age-related changes (Extended Data Fig. 7b). In newborns, no CDR3α motif was identified and CDR3β motifs were scarce (d0-ASSYG; d7-FxGxD). Children and adults displayed high similarity CDR3α-‘GGGSQG’ and CDR3β-‘RS’ motifs. Only the CDR3β-‘RS’ motif was detected in older adults. Ex vivo-identified CDR3α motifs (full public GAGGGSQGNLIF/GGGSQG/GGG/GG) were observed in proliferating A2/M158+CD8+ clonotypes in children and adults, at lower frequencies in children and near-absent in most older adults (Fig. 7d and Supplementary Table 3), with the exception of older adult BP114 (Supplementary Table 3). Ex vivo-identified public-associated CDR3β motifs (full public CASSIRSSYEQYF/RS/IG/YGY/IF/IY) were detected in dividing A2/M158+CD8+ T cells throughout the assay, with lower prevalence of CDR3β-CASSIRSSYEQYF and -‘RS’ motifs in children and more inter-donor variation in older adults (Fig. 7e, Supplementary Video and Supplementary Table 3). Irrespective of age, the highly prevalent ex vivo public clonotype (TRAV27/TRAJ42, CDR3α-CAGGGSQGNLIF, TRBV19/TRBJ2-7 and CDR3β-CASSIRSSYEQYF) was not dominant during proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 6; clone ID:p-A in Supplementary Table 3). Less prevalent ex vivo CDR3β-expressing clonotypes (Fig. 5) were among proliferating A2/M158+CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Table 3). High similarity CDR3β-‘IG’ motifs were identified in child and adult proliferating A2/M158+CD8+ T cells and CDR3β-‘IF’-expressing proliferating clonotypes were observed across age groups.Overall, highly prevalent clonotypes expressing public features in children and adults were associated with robust A2/M158+CD8+ T cell proliferation. These data demonstrated the importance of TCRαβ diversity, as ex vivo low-prevalent TCRs also proliferated upon in vitro stimulation. Further studies are needed to demonstrate whether broad-spectrum TCR proliferation is also observed following influenza infection.A2/M158 +CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality peaks in childrenWe investigated polyfunctionality of proliferating A2/M158+CD8+ T cells following re-stimulation with M158–66 peptide on day 9 (Fig. 7f,g). Proliferating polyfunctional A2/M158+CD8+ T cells, expressing interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), granzyme B (GrzB) and perforin, decreased with age (children 37.7%; adults 24.8%; older adults 11.3%). IFN-γ/TNF production decreased with age, from children (IFN-γ 59.4%; TNF 46.7%) to adults (IFN-γ 50.9%; TNF 30.6%) and older adults (IFN-γ 29.7%; TNF 22%). Expression of GrzB and perforin remained stable from children (GrzB 82.23%; perforin 81.18%) to adults (GrzB 87.75%; perforin 85.31%) but decreased in older adults (GrzB 68.4%; perforin 69.61%). Newborn proliferating A2/M158+CD8+ T cells were least functional, with 74.2% expressing no functional markers, followed by older adults (12.06%), adults (3.44%) and children (2.26%). Non-dividing cells were minimally polyfunctional (Fig. 7g).Overall, children’s proliferating A2/M158+ CD8+ T cells had the highest polyfunctionality whereas newborns had the lowest polyfunctionality followed by older adults, in line with their lower cytotoxic gene expression profiles ex vivo.CD8 co-receptor enhances avidity of young TCRsTo demonstrate that age-related functional changes of A2/M158+CD8+ T cells resulted from differential TCRαβ repertoires across age groups, we generated HEK293T-transient and SKW-3-stable cell lines encompassing full public or prominent age-specific TCRs identified ex vivo (C1, A1, OA1, OA2a, OA2b and OA3) or proliferating in vitro (pN1, pA2 and pOA4) (Fig. 8a and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). pN1 clonally expanded on day 7 of proliferation (newborn CB151 28 of 39 TCRs) and expressed child/adult-associated CDR3β-‘IG’ motif. Age-specific private child C1, adult A1 and older adult OA1 TCRs were more prevalent (TN010, 4 of 75; KK2, 5 of 70; DMC18, 6 of 105) compared to the full public TCRαβ within the donor’s ex vivo TCR repertoire, without prominent public CDR3α/β features. Low ex vivo frequency adult TCR pA2 (BP128; 1 of 32 TCRs), expressing the public-associated CDR3α-‘GG’ motif but no public TCRβ features, proliferated early in vitro. Older adult TCRs OA2a and OA2b originated from a prominent ex vivo clonotype (DMC19; 23 of 32 TCRs), encompassing a single ‘F’-expressing CDR3 β-chain and double TCR α-chains. Two older adult CDR3β-‘IF’-expressing TCRs included the ex vivo low-prevalent OA3 (BP127; 1 of 32 TCRs) and highly proliferating pOA4 (DMC18; 12 of 52 TCRs day 10) (Fig. 8a).Fig. 8: SKW-3-CD3+ and SKW-CD3+CD8+ cell lines expressing age-specific TCRs.a, Selection of A2/M158+CD8+ TCR specifically identified in certain age groups. p, proliferation; aa, amino acid. b,c, Representative A2/M158 tetramer-PE staining of SKW-3-CD3+ (b) and SKW-3-CD3+CD8+ (c) TCR-expressing cell lines. d, Median MFI A2/M158 tetramer-PE of SKW-3-CD3+ (open bars) and SKW-3-CD3+CD8+ TCR-expressing cell lines (closed bars) (n = 5 independent experiments, median and interquartile range (IQR)); dotted line indicates MFI threshold set by the parental cell line expressing no TCR.

Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sided Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s correction for multiple tests between the public TCR and the age-specific TCRs within the same cell line (d,j, black) or between the same TCRs across two cell lines (d, blue). P values are indicated above the graphs.Source dataFull size imageTransiently expressed TCRs together with CD3 complex units in HEK293T cells revealed that all TCRs, except OA2b, expressed CD3 on cell surface, indicative of productive TCRs. A1, pA2 and pOA4 had similar A2/M158 tetramer-binding avidities compared to public TCR, whereas pN1, C1 and OA2a displayed lower A2/M158-binding avidities. Older adult TCRs OA1 and OA3 displayed no A2/M158-specific binding, despite CD3 expression, suggesting potential CD8αβ co-receptor requirement to overcome the binding threshold (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b).To understand whether CD8 co-receptors enhance A2/M158 avidity, we compared A2/M158 tetramer staining between stable SKW-3 cell lines expressing productive TCRs (except OA2b) and CD3 (SKW-3-CD3+) or CD3 and CD8 (SKW-3-CD3+CD8+) (Fig. 8b–d and Extended Data Fig. 8c). CD8 co-receptors improved A2/M158-binding avidity of the public, pN1, C1, A1, OA2a and pOA4, but not pA2, OA1 and OA3. Overall, older adult OA1, OA2a and OA3 TCRs showed minimal A2/M158 binding avidity irrespectively of CD8 (Fig. 8b–d). To verify, cell lines were stained with wild-type (WT) A2/M158 tetramer (A2/M158-WT), A2/M158 tetramer with a knockout (KO) CD8-binding site (A2/M158-KO) and A2/M158 tetramer with an enhanced CD8-binding site (A2/M158-Enh) (Fig. 8e,f and Extended Data Fig. 8c,d). CD8-binding site KO reduced A2/M158-binding avidity of A1 and pOA4. Binding was lost for pN1 and C1. Conversely, CD8-binding site enhancement improved binding avidity of pN1, C1 and OA2a. No changes were observed for other TCRs (Fig. 8f) or in SKW-3-CD3+ TCR-expressing cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d).Overall, CD8 co-receptors enhanced binding avidity of age-specific private TCRs representing newborn, child, one adult and one older TCR, but had less impact on weak-binding older TCRs.Older A2/M158 +CD8+ TCRs display reduced activation capacityTo determine whether differential A2/M158 avidity of age-specific TCRs affected their activation, we performed peptide M158–66 titrations across nine TCRs in SKW-3-CD3+ and SKW-3-CD3+CD8+ cell lines. TCR activation was measured by CD69 expression and saturation curves provided half maximal effective concentrations (EC50), reflecting antigen sensitivity (Fig. 8g,h and Extended Data Fig. 8e,f). Activation thresholds of A1, pA2 and pOA4 TCRs were like public TCRs in SKW-CD3+ cells and SKW-3-CD3+CD8+ cells (<0.6 logM difference in EC50). Higher activation thresholds for pN1 and C1 compared to the public TCR in SKW-CD3+ cells were partly overcome in SKW-3-CD3+CD8+ cells for pN1 but not C1. Older TCRs OA1, OA2a and OA3 had the highest activation threshold, with 2.943–3.14 logM higher EC50 values compared to the public TCR in SKW-CD3+ cells and was not rescued by CD8 (Fig. 8h and Extended Data Fig. 8f). Activation at high peptide concentrations reassured that older TCRs were A2/M158-specific; however, their binding affinity was too low for detection through tetramer staining (Fig. 8d).Overall, ex vivo A2/M158-specific TCRs from older adults had reduced activation capacity compared to public and other age-specific TCRs. The CD8 co-receptor decreased the public, newborn (pN1) and adult (A1) TCR activation threshold, potentially resulting from improved binding avidity (Fig. 8b–f).Reduced recognition of M158 variants by age-specific TCRsWe stimulated age-specific or public TCR-expressing SKW-3-CD3+ (Fig. 8i,j) and SKW-3-CD3+CD8+ cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b) with WT and mutated M158–66 peptides containing single alanine substitutions at sequential positions, excluding the anchor residue (position (p) 2).In accordance with reports26,38,50, M158–66 p5 was critical for public TCR recognition in SKW-3-CD3+ and SKW-3-CD3+CD8+ cells. Additional loss in TCR recognition was observed for p6 (V6A) and p7 (F7A), and partial loss for L3A, G4A and T8A in SKW-3-CD3+ cells, which were overcome by CD8 coexpression (Fig. 8j and Extended Data Fig. 9b).Adult TCR A1 displayed a public-like TCR recognition profile, with p5 critical for TCR recognition and reduced recognition at p3, p4, p6, p7, p8 and p9 (Fig. 8i,j); however, CD8 only improved TCR recognition of M158–66 T8A (Extended Data Fig. 9). Newborn pN1 had two critical positions, p4 and p5, whereas CD8 coexpression partly overcame lower TCR recognition at p1, p3, p6, p7 and p8 (Fig. 8i,j and Extended Data Fig. 9). Child TCR C1 had 4 critical positions, p4, p5, p6 and p7, substantial reduction for p3 and p9, and partial loss for p8 (Fig. 8i,j). The CD8 co-receptor only improved recognition of M158–66 T8A (Extended Data Fig. 9). The adult pA2 clonotype strongly proliferated early despite the presence of the full public TCR. No critical TCR recognition positions were identified but decreases were observed for p3, p4, p6 and p7 and partial loss for p5 (Fig. 8j), which was improved by CD8 coexpression (Extended Data Fig. 9). Older TCRs had notably unique recognition patterns, with multiple critical binding sites (OA1: p3, p7, p8 and p9; OA2a: p6 and p8; OA3: p3, p5, p6 and p8) and substantially reduced binding sites (OA1: p5; OA2a: p1, p4, p5, p7 and p9; OA3: p7 and p9) (Fig. 8j). pOA4 had a single critical binding site (p1) and substantial reduction for p4, p5, p6, p7 and p8 (Fig. 8j). Generally, the CD8 co-receptor did not improve TCR recognition (Extended Data Fig. 9). Of note, the alanine substitution at p3 (L3A) in older TCR OA2a increased TCR recognition, suggesting that this TCR might have binding properties for another peptide.Overall, age-specific TCRs display reduced ability to recognize M158–66 peptide variants. Ex vivo older private TCRs displayed unique A2/M158 binding profiles, underpinning their reduced binding capacity, avidity, functionality and proliferating capacity compared to other prominent age-specific TCRs, especially TCRs with public-associated features found at high frequency in children and adults.DiscussionWe linked age-specific single-cell molecular gene profiles with phenotypes, functionality and paired single-cell TCRαβ repertoires of influenza-specific HLA-A*02:01/M158–66-specific CD8+ T cells. Unexpectedly, older A2/M158+CD8+ T cells did not reach terminally differentiated or exhausted end points. Instead, reduced functionality was associated with loss of highly functional public TCRαβ clonotypes dominating younger TCRαβ repertoires. Conversely, large clonal expansions of less-functional private TCRαβs dominated older TCRαβ repertoires. Age-specific transcriptomes supported a linear differentiation trajectory from newborns to children, then adults, whereas suboptimal clonal resets in older adults were associated with newborn/child-like molecular signatures.Older A2/M158+CD8+ T cells lacked immunosenescent hallmarks, including terminally differentiated TEMRA cells and CD57 expression, matching gene expression profiles. High CD8+ TEMRA frequencies are linked to chronic EBV or CMV infections18,51,52. Instead, older adults maintained robust A2/M158+CD8+ Tnaive and TCM phenotypes, suggesting that acute viral infections, such as influenza, do not trigger terminal differentiation.Age-specific A2/M158+CD8+ T cells transcriptomes corroborated age-specific phenotypic profiles, including mixed naive/memory phenotypes in children and older adults. Newborn naive T cells uniquely expressed TLB. The role of TLB, encoding TNF-C, remains ill defined. Cytotoxic and TRAV27/TRBV19 genes dominated child and adult A2/M158-specific transcriptomes and their public TCR features resulted in higher proliferative capacity and polyfunctionality, compared to newborns and older adults. Older A2/M158-specific transcriptomes, dominated by CXCR4 (ref. 39), KLF2, SELL, TXNIP, PIK3IP1, CD37 and TRBV27, displayed less-differentiated cell states, lacked exhaustion genes, expressed AP-1 transcription factors FOS and JUN (progenitor of exhaustion in acute infection53), C-JUN (resistance to exhaustion43) and distinct clonal lineages. Trajectory analysis supported lack of a terminally differentiated end stage and suboptimal clonal reset in older adults. Suboptimal clonotypes expressing older private features were detected at a low frequency in younger age groups.Older suboptimal A2/M158-specific clonotypes underpinned differences in gene expression and functionality. The public TCRαβ clonotype was first identified in children, peaked in adults and decreased in older adults, coinciding with large private TCRαβ expansions. The relatively featureless A2/M158 structure requires a specific peg-notch mode of interaction by CDR3β-‘RS’ in the public TRAV27/TRBV19 clonotype without peptide-specific CDR3α binding26,27,38,44. Glycine repeats allow the required conformational changes50. Fewer CDR3α-glycines reduces flexibility in older ‘RS’-expressing TCRs, potentially hampering A2/M158 binding. Alternatively, CDR3α amino acids with bulkier side chains might hamper the peg-notch recognition26,27,38. Low-frequency public-associated A2/M158-specific CDR3β motifs, including ‘xGxY’ and ‘F’, were described27; however, gradual decline of public-associated CDR3β-RS/-IG/-YGY/-IY/-IF/-IV motifs across the human lifespan was not reported. Our study supports that alternative TCR structures recognize the featureless A2/M158-complex27,46.During infections, ‘best-fit’ high-avidity clonotypes are selected from naive TCR repertoires and expand following subsequent encounters54,55. We demonstrate that ‘best-fit’ high-avidity public clonotypes peak in adults and are gradually replaced by low-avidity clonotypes in older adults. TRBV19/CDR3β-RS-expressing clonotypes dominate over TRBV19-expressing clonotypes with other public CDR3β-associated features, possibly because CDR3β-RS only requires two amino acids to bind the A2/M158 complex regardless of the TCR α-chain27,38; however, TCR repertoire diversity remains important to protect against escape variants5,27. How this delicate balance between expanded best-fit clonotypes and TCR diversity is maintained following repeated infections remains unexplored. Children and adults maintain diverse TCR repertoires during in vitro expansion. Reduced public TCRαβ clonotypes and TCRαβ diversity within older TCR repertoires explains why older adults, in the absence of pre-existing antibodies, are at higher risk of severe disease during influenza epidemics and pandemics. Conversely, highly functional and diverse public TCRαβ repertoires in children clarifies their relative superiority in fighting influenza infections. Understanding how we can preserve this delicate balance between expansion of ‘best-fit’ TCRs while maintaining TCR diversity may be the Holy Grail in defining how we can maintain optimal immunity across the human lifespan through vaccination and/or immunotherapies.MethodsStudy participants and ethicsDonors were selected from a large HLA-typed randomly recruited lifespan cohort n ≥ 500, consisting of 154 newborns, 30 children, 360 adults/older adults, based on their expression of HLA-A*02:01. Overall, 11 HLA-A*02:01+ newborns (0 years), 12 HLA-A*02:01+ children (median 9 years, range 3–16), 20 HLA-A*02:01+ adults (median 37 years, range 18–58) and 18 HLA-A*02:01+ older adults (median 72 years, range 63–88) were included in the study (Supplementary Table 1). Adults and older adults were recruited via the University of Melbourne (UoM), Deepdene Medical Clinic and the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood. Children were recruited via the Launceston General Hospital and St Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Umbilical cord blood, reflecting newborn’s blood, was obtained via Mercy Hospital for Women. Peripheral blood was collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. All participants or their guardians provided informed written consent. Participants of the study did not receive any compensation. PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-Paque (GE HealthCare) gradient centrifugation, and then cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until required. HLA class I and II molecular genotyping was performed from genomic DNA by the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood. CMV status was determined as described previously56. Experiments conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki Principles and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Code of Practice. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the UoM (ethics IDs 24567, 13344 and 23852), Australian Red Cross Lifeblood (ID 2015 8), St Jude Children’s Research Hospital (XPD12-089 IIBANK), Mercy Hospital for Women (R14-25) and Tasmanian Health and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee (ID H0017479).Peptides and tetramersWT M158–66 peptide (GILGFVFTL) and its single amino acid alanine substitution variants (AIGFVFTL, GIAGFVFTL, GILAFVFTL, GILGAVFTL, GILGFAFTL, GILGFVATL, GILGFVFAL and GILGFVFTA) were purchased from GeneScript. HLA-A*02:01-M158 (GILGFVFTL) monomers: WT, KO CD8-binding site (D227K; CD8 KO) and enhanced CD8-binding site (Q115E; CD8 Enh) were generated by refolding each peptide with its restricted HLA α-heavy chain-BirA and β2-microglobulin57,58,59 before 8:1 conjugation with PE-streptavidin (BD Biosciences) to generate A2/M158 tetramers.Ex vivo A2/M158 tetramer enrichmentPBMCs (1–5 × 107) were thawed in complete RPMI (cRPMI) medium (RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco), 1 mM MEM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 100 µM MEM non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 5 mM HEPES buffer solution (Gibco), 55 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 100 U ml−1 penicillin (Gibco), 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin (Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco)) supplemented with 50 U ml−1 Benzonase (Novagen Merck) before undergoing TAME as previously described6,13. Briefly, cells were resuspended in MACS buffer (PBS plus 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA) and magnetically enriched with PE-streptavidin conjugated A2/M158 (GILGFVFTL) tetramer using anti-PE Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) and passed through an LS column (Miltenyi Biotec) to enrich A2/M158 tetramer-positive cells. Cells were then surfaced stained in MACS buffer using anti-CD71-BV421 (1:50 dilution, BD Biosciences 562995), anti-CD3-BV510 (1:200 dilution, BioLegend 317332), anti-HLA-DR-BV605 (1:100 dilution, BioLegend 307640), anti-CD4-BV650 (1:100 dilution, BD Biosciences 563875), anti-CD27-BV711 (1:200 dilution, BD Horizon 563167), anti-CD38-BV785 (1:100 dilution, BD Biosciences 563964), anti-CD57-APC (1:400 dilution, BD Biosciences 560845), anti-CCR7-AF700 (1:50 dilution, BD Biosciences 561143), anti-CD14-APC-Cy7 (1:100 dilution, BD Biosciences 560180), anti-CD19 (1:100 dilution, BD Biosciences 560177), anti-CD45RA-FITC (1:200 dilution, BD Biosciences 555488), anti-CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5 (1:200 dilution, BD Biosciences 565310), anti-CD95-PECF594 (1:100 dilution, BD Horizon 562395), anti-PD-1-1-PE-Cy7 (1:50 dilution, BD Biosciences 561272) and Live/Dead fixable aqua dead-cell stain (1:800 dilution, Invitrogen L10119), fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (ProSciTec) for acquiring on an LSR Fortessa II (BD Biosciences) or resuspended in MACS buffer for single cell-(index)-sorting using a BD FACSAria III (BD Biosciences), followed by the analysis using FlowJo software (v.10.8.1) (BD Biosciences). A2/M158+CD8+ T cell frequencies were calculated relative to the total CD8+T cell numbers in an unenriched fraction as described previously6,13,60. Samples with <10 A2/M158+CD8+ T cells counted were excluded for phenotypic analyses.Single-cell RNA sequencingThree HLA-A*02:01-expressing donors from each age group (Supplementary Fig. 2a) were selected for scRNA-seq analysis. A2/M158+CD8+ T cells were TAME-enriched and then individually (index-) sorted into chilled 96-well twin.tec PCR plates (Eppendorf) containing lysis buffer (1 μl RNase inhibitor and 19 μl Triton X-100) after TAME and on a BD Aria III sorter. Libraries were generated as described previously61,62. A Nextera XT DNA Library Prep kit was used for the generation of sequencing libraries and sequencing performed on a NextSeq500 platform with 150-bp high-output paired-end chemistry for 901 A2/M158-tetramer+CD8+ T cells/donor and 101 controls.Raw sequencing reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v.0.39) (ref. 63) and aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38.89) using TopHat (v.2.1.1). Gene expression FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) values were quantified using Cufflinks (v.2.2.1) (ref. 64). TCR sequences were reconstructed using VDJPuzzle65,66.scRNA-seq quality control, normalization and batch correctionDownstream analysis was performed in R using packages downloaded from Bioconductor v.3.10. Cells were removed from each batch if they did not meet these criteria: less than 40% reads aligned to mitochondrial genes, number of detected genes more than 400. The bulk samples and genes expressed in zero cells were removed. Normalization was performed using the NormalizeData function from Seurat (v.4.1.0). To minimize potential batch effects, the experiment was designed to distribute donors from each age group to be included across separate experiments. In addition, donors were distributed over across plates within each experiment. Batch effect was tested using the FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions from Seurat67. For scRNA-seq bioinformatics analysis no correction for batch effect was performed because of poor evidence of bias and also for sufficient mix of cells among clusters based on experimental design (plates and experiment number). The observed segregation based on age group and phenotype was an expected biological bias given the experimental design.Analysis of scRNA-seq dataDimensionality reduction and clustering were also performed in Seurat using the normalized matrix. PCA was performed on the normalized data using the 3,000 most variable genes. Clustering was performed using the shared nearest neighbor modularity optimization-based clustering algorithm (FindClusters(resolution = 0.8, algorithm = ‘louvain’)) as implemented in Seurat.Differential gene expression was performed using MAST (v.1.16.0) implemented in the function FindMarkers in Seurat v.4 and using two-sided P values to report the results REF_SEURAT67. Notably, the test used was MAST and batch was used as a latent variable with a log(FC) threshold of 0.3. Other parameters were kept as default. Signature scores were computed from the normalized single cell transcriptomic matrix as the average log(FPKM + 1) of all genes in the signature. Differential expression output across all the analyses is reported in Supplementary Table 4 (UMAP clusters) and Supplementary Table 5 (age groups).Gene set enrichment analysisGSEA was performed using the R package fsgea (v.1.16.0). Normalized enrichment scores were assessed using the fgsea(…, maxSize = 500, nperm = 10,000) function across the curated Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) Hallmark, C2 curated gene sets consisting of canonical gene sets PID). Customized gene signatures for T cell phenotypes are reported in Supplementary Table 6, which were prepared by manually curating published data.Trajectory inferencePAGA analysis was performed through Scanpy (v.1.7.1) (ref. 68) with parameters as recommended22. The FPKM matrix following normalization (with Seurat), along with the top 20 PCAs (previously generated with Seurat) were used and visualization was performed using sc.pp.neighbors(n_neighbors = 8, n_pcs = 20) and a coarse-grained and simplified graph using sc.tl.paga. Clusters were calculated using sc.tl.louvain(resolution = 0.8) and visualization was performed using sc.pl.paga and sc.pl.draw_graph. Pseudotime analysis was performed using the diffusion map algorithm (sc.tl.dpt) by manually assigning an initial iroot value. Scaled pseudotime were used with Loess smoothing and were calculated as uniformly distributed mapping of the diffusion pseudotime values to preserve the cell order and account for heterogeneous distribution of gaps between pseudotime values. The growth rate with which T cell phenotypic/age group subsets change along the inferred pseudotime trajectories were calculated as the ratio between the difference in cell numbers and the scaled pseudotime values over a window of size 0.05. These values were then plotted using the geom_smooth R function with default parameters.Single-cell RT–PCR and paired TCRαβ sequencingA2/M158+CD8+ T cells were TAME-enriched and subsequently individually (index-) sorted into chilled 96-well twin.tec PCR plates (Eppendorf) and immediately stored at −80 °C until required. Single-cell paired CDR3α and CDR3β regions were analyzed by multiplex-nested PCR with reverse transcription and followed by sequencing of the CDRα and CDRβ products, essentially as described previously6,26,69, except for using double amounts of reaction mix in the complementary DNA step for older adult samples. Sequences were analyzed with FinchTV. V-J regions were identified by IMGT query (www.imgt.org/IMGT_vquest). TCR sequences were parsed using the TCRdist analytical pipeline44. Clonotypes were defined as single-cell TCRαβ pairs that exhibit the same V, J and CDR3 regions.A2/M158-specific TCR motifs in publicly available datasetsA2/M158-specific TCRβ sequences identified in our study were further verified in two publicly available bulk TCRβ datasets from independent cohorts of healthy individuals8,47. TCR was considered matched when it had the same CDR3β and genomic V segment. For all the donors in the cohorts, we calculated the total frequency of matched TCRs within each CDR3β-motif. As conventional HLA typing was not available for all donors in the independent cohorts, we divided them into HLA-A*2+ (n = 329; age group 0–9, n = 6; 10–19, n = 14; 20–39, n = 157; 40–59, n = 111; 60–79, n = 24; and 80–103, n = 17) and HLA-A*2- (n = 423; age group 0–9, n = 22; 10–19, n = 24; 20–39, n = 189; 40–59, n = 150; 60–79, n = 29; and 80–103, n = 9) using TCR repertoire based HLA typing procedure as previously described70.A2/M158 +CD8+ T cell proliferation assayPBMCs from HLA-A*02:01+ donors (~21 × 106) were pre-incubated with cell trace violet (Violet Proliferation Dye 450, BD Horizon) according to the manufacturer’s instructions before generating A2/M158-specific CD8+ T cell lines6. Briefly, one-third of the labeled PBMCs were pulsed with 10 μM M158–66 peptide (GILGFVFTL), or DMSO as unstimulated control, for 60 min at 37 °C, washed twice with RPMI and incubated with the remaining two-thirds of the non-peptide-pulsed autologous PBMCs in cRPMI at a final concentration of non-pulsed cells at 1 × 106 per well for each day of the proliferation assay. Cells were cultured in a 48-wells plate for 10 d at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cultures were supplemented on day 4 with 20 U ml−1 rIL-2 (Roche) and were maintained with fresh medium containing 10 U ml−1 IL-2 when needed. On day 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 (ICS) and 10, respective wells were collected, counted and washed once in MACS buffer and incubated with anti-human FcR block (20 µl per 1 × 107 cells) (Miltenyi Biotec) for 15 min on ice before staining with PE-streptavidin-conjugated tetramers (1:100 dilution in MACS buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. After one wash, cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with the same surface stain as described for the TAME, except without anti-CD71-BV421. Cells were subsequently washed once and resuspended in MACS buffer for single cell-(index)-sorting using a BD FACSAria III for subsequent TCRαβ sequencing (days 3, 5, 6, 7 and 10) or fixed with 1% PFA for acquiring on an LSR Fortessa II (day 4), followed by analysis using FlowJo software (v.10.8.1). Proliferation due in combination with A2/M158 tetramer staining of CD8+ T cells was used to track proliferating A2/M158-specific CD8+ T cells over time. Ex vivo numbers of A2/M158+CD8+ T cells on day 0 were based on the frequencies obtained from TAME analysis, as frequencies were relatively low.On day 9, expanded A2/M158+CD8+ T cells were simulated with 1 μM M158–66 peptide and cultured for 5 h in the presence of 10 U ml−1 rIL-2 and Golgi Stop (BD Biosciences). Following activation, cells were surface stained for 30 min with human anti-CD3-BV510 (1:200 dilution, BioLegend 317332), anti-CD8-BV605 (1:200 dilution, BD Horizon 564116), anti-CD4-BV650 (1:200 dilution, BD Horizon 563875), anti-CD27-BV711 (1:200 dilution, BD 563167), anti-CD14-APC-H7 (1:100 dilution, BD Pharmingen 560180), anti-CD19-APC-H7 (1:100 dilution, BD Pharmingen 560177), Live/Dead near-infrared (1:800 dilution, Invitrogen L10119), anti-CD45RA-FITC (1:200 dilution, BD Biosciences 555488), PE-streptavidin-conjugated A2/M158 (GILGFVFTL) tetramer and anti-CD95-PECF594 (1:100 dilution, BD Horizon 562395). Cells were fixed with BD Fix-Perm buffer (BD Biosciences) for 20 min, before intracellular staining for 30 min on ice with anti-TNF-α-APC (1:100 dilution, BD 340534), anti-granzyme B-AF700 (1:50 dilution, BD 560213), anti-IFN-γ-FITC (1:100 dilution, eBioscience 45-7-319-42) and perforin (1:10 dilution, BioLegend 353316) in perm wash buffer (BD Biosciences). Cells were washed in perm wash buffer and resuspended in MACS buffer for acquiring on an LSRFortesa II followed by analysis using FlowJo software (v.10.8.1).Transient transfections of A2/M158-specific TCR α/β-chainsGenes encoding the full-length A2/M158 TCR α- and β-chains joined by a P2A linker for the public, newborn (pN1), child (C1), adult (A1 and pA2) and older adults (OA1, OA2a, OA2b, OA3 and pOA4) TCRs (Fig. 7a) were synthesized as double-stranded DNA fragments (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cloned into the pMSCV-IRES-GFP II (pMIG II) expression vector71; a gift from D. Vignali (Addgene plasmid #52107; RRID Addgene_52107). The pMIG.TCR plasmid was transiently co-transfected with the pMIG.huCD3 plasmid in HEK293T cells using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Promega)72,73. Cells were cultured for 72 h, collected by mechanical disruption and stained with anti-CD3-BV421 (1:100 dilution, BD Biosciences 562426), Live/Dead near-infrared (1:500 dilution) and PE-streptavidin-conjugated A2/M158 (GILGFVFTL) tetramer. Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for acquiring on an LSRFortesa II (day 4) followed by analysis using FlowJo software (v.10.8.1).Generation of A2/M158-specific TCR-expressing cell linespMIG.TCR plasmids were used to retrovirally transduce SKW-3 cells expressing CD3 only or CD3 and CD8 (refs. 73,74,75) as previously described71 to generate SKW-3.CD3.public, SKW-3.CD3.pN1, SKW-3.CD3.C1, SKW-3.CD3.A1, SKW-3.CD3.pA2, SKW-3.CD3.OA1, SKW-3.CD3.OA2a, SKW-3.CD3.OA3, SKW-3.CD3.pOA4 and SKW-3.CD3 + CD8.public, SKW-3.CD3 + CD8.pN1, SKW-3.CD3 + CD8.C1, SKW-3.CD3 + CD8.A1, SKW-3.CD3 + CD8.pA2, SKW-3.CD3 + CD8.OA1, SKW-3.CD3 + CD8.OA2a, SKW-3.CD3 + CD8.OA3, SKW-3.CD3 + CD8.pOA4. Transduced cells were stained with anti-CD3-BV421 (1:100 dilution) and Live/Dead near-infrared (1:500 dilution) and FACS sorted for GFPhiCD3hi cells.A2/M158 tetramer staining of TCR-expressing cell linesSKW-3.CD3.TCR and SKW-3.CD3+CD8.TCR cell lines were stained with PE-streptavidin-conjugated A2/M158 (GILGFVFTL) tetramers (WT, CD8 KO or CD8 Enh) (1:100 dilution in MACS buffer), anti-CD3-BV421 (1:100 dilution) and Live/Dead near-infrared (1:500 dilution) in MACS buffer for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for acquiring on an LSR Fortessa II followed by the analysis using FlowJo software (v.10.8.1). Median A2/M158 tetramer-PE MFI value across all SKW-3.TCR cell lines was established for cells expressing the same MFI for CD3-BV421 and GFP to ensure similar expression of the TCR on the cell surface.Peptide titration and alanine scanC1R cells expressing HLA-A*02:01 (C1R.A2; a gift from W. Chen, La Trobe University) were maintained in cRPMI supplemented with Hygromycin B (50 mg ml−1). C1R.A2 cells were pulsed with WT M158–66 (GILGFVFTL) peptide at different dilutions ranging from 10−4 to 10−12 M (half logM steps) for WT M158–66 peptide titration or at a dilution of 10−5 M for the alanine scan with WT M158–66 (GILGFVFTL), P1A (AILGFVFTL), P3A (GIAGFVFTL), P4A (GILAFVFTL), P5A (GILGAVFTL), P6A (GILGFAFTL), P7A (GILGFVATL), P8A (GILGFVFAL) or P9A (GILGFVFTA) peptides for 1 h at 37 °C. Due to a lower activation threshold found in the older adult OA1, OA2a and OA3 TCRs, a higher peptide concentration of 10−4 M was used. Peptide pulsed C1R.A2 cells were washed twice, resuspended in cRPMI and incubated at 1:1 with SKW-3.CD3.TCR or SKW-3.CD3+CD8.TCR cell lines for 16–18 h at 37 °C. Dynabeads human T activator CD3/CD28 (Gibco) were used as a positive control. Cells were subsequently collected and stained with CD69-PE-Cy7 (1:100 dilution, BD 557745), Live/Dead near-infrared (1:500 dilution) in MACS buffer for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, washed twice and fixed with 1% PFA for acquiring on an LSRFortesa II, followed by analysis using FlowJo software (v.10.8.1).Statistical analysisNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but our sample sizes are larger than those reported in previous publications16. Normality tests were not performed and nonparametric statistical analyses were performed in the study. Unless otherwise indicated, data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism (v.9.3.0, GraphPad) using a two-sided Kruskal–Wallis test combined with Dunn’s correction for multiple tests. A Mann–Whitney U-test with Holm multiple testing correction was used to compare TCR frequencies in HLA-A*2+ and HLA-A*2− donors as well as CDR3β motif frequencies across different age groups within the independent datasets. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. For statistical comparisons of TCR Pgen, N insertions and deletions, analyses were conducted in the R statistical environment (v.4.2.2). Each unique clonotype was included in the analyses only once and mixed-effects models were fitted via Penalized Quasi-Likelihood (glmmPQL function from the MASS package, v.7.3.58) (ref. 76). To correct for the non-independence of the data owing to shared donors across clonotypes, subject was included as a random effect. As Pgen best fitted a log-normal distribution, we utilized the Gaussian family with a log link. For N insertions and deletions, which best fitted a negative binomial distribution, we used the negative.binomial family, with theta first estimated by the glm.nb function. To control type II error, P values were corrected for multiple testing using FDR adjustment. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The second line indicates unenriched, enriched and flowthrough fractions of the TAME assay. The unenriched fraction was used to define the frequency and phenotype of the total CD8+ T cell population (gray gate and cell populations), whereas the A2/M158 tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells of the enriched fraction were used to define the frequency and phenotype of the total A2/M158+CD8+ T cell population (red gate and cell populations). Naïve/memory T cell subsets were identified as Tcm (CD27+CD45RA−) cells, Tem (CD27−CD45RA−), Temra (CD27−CD45RA+), Tnaïve (CD27+CD45RA+CD95−) and Tscm (CD27+CD45RA+CD95+) cells. Boolean gating was used to identify frequencies of individual and combined expression of CD57 and PD-1 and combined expression of CD38, HLA-DR and CD71. b, number of A2/M158+phenotype+CD8+ T cells per 106 CD8+ T cells across all age groups. Co-expression of CD57 and PD-1 in total CD8+ T cells (c) and A2/M158+CD8+ T cells (d-top panel) and number of A2/M158+CD57+CD8+ T cells (d-middle panel) or A2/M158+PD-1+CD8+ T cells (d-bottom panel) per 106 CD8+ T cells across all age groups. Co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR in total CD8+ T cells (e) and A2/M158+CD8+ T cells (f). Numbers of A2/M158+phenotype+CD8+ T cells per 106 CD8+ T cell data were right shifted by 0.001 (that is absence of A2/M158 events in a specific phenotypic population are displayed as 0.001) (b,d-middle and bottom panel). Only samples with 10 or more total A2/M158+ events were included for phenotype analysis (b-f). Horizontal bars indicate the median, dots represent individual donors, with n = 10 newborns, n = 12 children, n = 20 adults and n = 16 older adults in b, d and f and n = 11 newborns, n = 12 children, n = 20 adults and n = 18 older adults in c and e. Technical replicates were not performed due to limited samples. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sided Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s correction for multiple tests (b, d-middle and bottom panel) or a two-sided Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (c, d-top panel, e, f). Exact significant p-values are indicated above the graphs.

A family of viruses known as influenza B/Yamagata has not been seen since March 2020, when flu circulation worldwide declined to very low levels in the face of the onslaught of Covid and the protections people took to avoid contracting it. Flu transmission eventually resumed, but of the tens of thousands of influenza B viruses detected and subtyped in the years since, B/Yamagata viruses have not been seen.advertisement “Right now there really isn’t any benefit to having Yamagata in the vaccine,” said David Wentworth, director of the WHO’s Collaborating Centre for the Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who was on the expert panel that made the recommendation. The decision was applauded by influenza virologist Florian Krammer, of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan. “Why would you include something that’s not around?” he asked. Newsletters Sign up for Daily Recap All the health and medical news you need today, in one email Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy The recommendation was made following a weeklong meeting of flu experts from around the world who gather twice a year at the WHO to study circulating flu viruses to advise on what future versions of flu shots should protect against. This week’s meeting was to recommend what viruses should go into the 2024 Southern Hemisphere’s winter shot.advertisement In addition to the fact that there is no benefit to including B/Yamagata viruses in the vaccine at this point, there is a theoretical risk of doing so, a report from the meeting noted. Manufacturers must grow B/Yamagata viruses for inclusion in the vaccines. In most flu shots — the types that are injected — those viruses are killed at a point in the manufacturing process. But a leak from a manufacturing plant could theoretically release B/Yamagata viruses into the world. Likewise, the intranasal flu vaccine FluMist — made by AstraZeneca — contains live but weakened flu viruses. Those viruses, too, could theoretically reintroduce the virus family to the world. The committee urged regulatory bodies to work with flu vaccine manufacturers to remove the B/Yamagata component from vaccine formulation “as soon as possible.” “Here we’re balancing the absence of circulation of the B/Yamagata lineage virus with a theoretical risk that we are manufacturing and using a component that’s not necessary,” said Kanta Subbarao, director of the WHO’s Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia. B/Yamagata viruses haven’t been seen since late March 2020. The rapid and global implementation of social distancing measures, masking, and the profound early reduction in international travel resulted in a substantial reduction in flu transmission. There was virtually no flu season in the winter of 2020-21. “The other ones — H1, H3, and Victoria — made it through. But there was also a huge bottleneck and Yamagata was not lucky enough to make it through,” said Krammer. For many low- and middle-income countries, the recommendation will not lead to any change. Many still use trivalent vaccine — a three-in-one shot that protects against influenza A viruses H1N1 and H3N2, plus one of the flu B viruses. In recent years, that would have been the B/Victoria lineage, the only B viruses still circulating. In countries that moved to quadrivalent flu vaccines a number of years ago, the recommendation may lead to changes in flu vaccine manufacturing, but it won’t be immediate, the experts warned at a press conference the WHO called to announce the outcome of the week’s discussions. Changing the composition of a vaccine requires regulatory approval, which in the case of the United States means signoff from the Food and Drug Administration. Wentworth said the FDA has been discussing the possibility of recommending removal of the B/Yamagata component from flu vaccines. But whether that’s easy or difficult to do will depend on whether flu vaccine manufacturers still have licenses for former trivalent formulations. STAT reached out to the FDA for comment on the issue, but has not yet heard back. “Basically it’s going to be different between different companies — whether or not they retained their trivalent license and in which form it was retained, and whether their processes have changed, even though they have their old license,” Wentworth said. “It’s not something that you can do in one day. It’s going to take time. And that’s why our suggestion was to really forecast to the manufacturers and the regulatory authorities that they can start working on this process and try to expedite the process where it makes sense, for safety, etc.” The experts stressed there is no disadvantage to individuals of getting a quadrivalent vaccine at this point, but no advantage from the B/Yamagata component either. The flu shots currently used in the United States employ a quadrivalent formulation. In the years since the Yamagata viruses ceased to be detected, there has been active discussion in the scientific community about replacing that component of quadrivalent shots with another type of flu virus — a second H3N2 vaccine, or one of the bird or swine flu viruses that are seen as pandemic threats. While those ideas are still possibilities, that idea is not yet ready for prime time, Subbarao said. “From a regulatory standpoint, that’s not very straightforward,” she said. “I think there is a great interest from the influenza research community, but it is still at the research stage rather than being ready for the kinds of discussions that our committee has to make recommendations for the vaccine composition.” About the Author Reprints Helen Branswell Senior Writer, Infectious Diseases Helen Branswell covers issues broadly related to infectious diseases, including outbreaks, preparedness, research, and vaccine development.

The list includes the following groups: • Care home residents • Adults aged 65 and over • Those with certain underlying health conditions, listed in the JCVI clinical risk group, which can be found here: Greenbook chapter 14a COVID-19 Covid-19 vaccine People with epilepsy are not automatically eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine, unless they are in one of the groups above. They are not included as part of the clinical risk group unless they have respiratory difficulties due to a chronic neurological condition such as epilepsy. This is because people in this category are at greater risk of serious disease and most likely to benefit from the vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccine The ‘flu vaccine is available to care home residents, adults aged 65 and over and people aged six months to 65 in clinical risk groups. However, just as with the Covid-19 vaccine, people with epilepsy are not included automatically in the clinical risk group unless they have respiratory difficulties due to a chronic neurological condition such as epilepsy. GPs can decide at their discretion which of their patients are eligible if they aren’t in one of these groups. Speak to your doctor if you have questions about whether you qualify. You can also use this letter from our Medical Director, Professor Ley Sander, if you want to support your case for eligibility. To book a vaccination, you can: • Book a Covid-19 vaccination online (using NHS.uk), via the NHS App or by calling 119. • Book an appointment to get the ‘flu vaccination through your GP or by visiting a pharmacy offering ‘flu vaccinations. Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer, said: “We need to protect people who are most at risk of becoming seriously ill and prevent avoidable hospitalisations and deaths, so it is very important that everyone who is eligible receives their vaccination. Almost 5,000 sites are taking part in the campaign this year to make it as easy as possible for people to get protection.” LET'S STAY IN TOUCH...

This year’s flu clinics kick off on Tuesday, Sept. 26, at an expanded number of locations across campus, and will continue to administer the vaccine through early November. A full list of clinic dates and locations is available at flu.stanford.edu. Rich Wittman (Image credit: Andrew Brodhead) Rich Wittman, the medical director of Stanford’s Occupational Health Clinic in Environmental Health & Safety, explains what to expect this flu season, why it is important to get a flu shot, and how you can help promote good health this flu season. What should the Stanford community expect from this year’s flu season?I would anticipate that we will see more cases of flu this year than in recent years due to a decrease in social distancing and face masking, and an increase in travel and gatherings, as many of us have returned toward pre-COVID socialization. That said, in past years, Stanford community members have been very good at prioritizing flu vaccination and practicing good health hygiene and other preventive behaviors, including staying home when ill, which has helped to keep our community healthy during the flu season.We certainly learned during COVID that flu transmission dynamics can be interrupted with face masking, good hand hygiene, and staying home when sick, which may help flatten the curve. That noted, since individuals can be infectious before they have symptoms, and people can still shed virus when they are feeling better, vaccination is the most effective tool in minimizing illness severity.Last year, Vaden Health Services and our Occupational Health Centers administered over 5,000 flu shots, free of charge, to faculty, staff, postdocs, and students. This year we are holding flu clinics at an expanded number of locations on campus, from late September to early November. What can you tell us about the predominant flu strain this year?We often receive questions about how well the flu vaccine this year matches the circulating flu strains. Data from Australia reveals a very high percentage match of vaccine strains to the circulating virus, which is promising, but there are many factors that impact what might happen in the United States.In general, in reviewing the seasonal flu data from the southern hemisphere winter (our summer), we see higher flu activity than last year, with a slightly mixed picture from country to country. From a severity standpoint, Australia saw an early-mid season peak in hospitalizations, at a level higher than last year, but lower than the pre-COVID years. “Getting a flu shot is a simple and effective way to safeguard personal health while contributing to community efforts to control the spread of the flu. Plus, it reduces the likelihood that you, your friends, and your family will miss work, school, and other events together.” —Rich Wittman Medical Director, Stanford Occupational Health Clinic When does flu activity usually peak in California?Often there are multiple influenza waves during the season, with typically an initial rise in influenza A cases, followed by influenza B. While we typically see the highest number of flu cases in late December to early February, each year is different, and I follow the CDC’s county-by-county map to monitor the weekly rise in flu-like illness.I also find it extremely valuable to track flu virus, as well as COVID-19 and other viral diseases, through the wastewater dashboards. Historically flu illness will rise in the East and Southeast regions of the U.S. ahead of Northern California, and I will use the rise in wastewater levels outside the Bay Area as a leading indicator of what may occur here.Since Stanford conducts our own wastewater tracking for campus at CODIGA, I will follow the current wastewater levels of flu and other flu-like illness at Stanford and in local communities to help inform my personal decisions about masking when around large groups and when traveling. Currently, we are seeing an initial rise in Influenza A at CODIGA. When is the best time to get a flu shot? How long does it take to build immunity?It takes roughly two weeks to build full protection, so we usually recommend getting vaccinated by late October, ahead of Thanksgiving travel and the typical flu-like illness case rise in mid-November. Given the recent recommendation for everyone to obtain an updated COVID booster, and based upon current U.S. flu trends and local wastewater levels, it makes sense to vaccinate now with the flu and address COVID boosting shortly after that. While certainly people can get both COVID and flu vaccines on the same day, we have found that many at Stanford prefer to separate them in time, which is a valid personal preference. What are some of the benefits of getting the flu vaccine?Getting a flu vaccine offers several important benefits. First, it reduces the risk of contracting the flu and its associated symptoms, including fever, cough, and severe headache with fatigue. Second, vaccination notably lowers the likelihood of severe complications, hospitalization, and even death, especially for high-risk groups such as young children, those over 65 years of age, and those with underlying health conditions. And third, getting a flu shot can help to promote herd immunity, which is when the overall spread of the virus is reduced within a community as a result of vaccination.Getting a flu shot is a simple and effective way to safeguard personal health while contributing to community efforts to control the spread of the flu. Plus, it reduces the likelihood that you, your friends, and your family will miss work, school, and other events together. What else can community members do to prevent the spread of flu on campus?In addition to getting vaccinated against the flu, it’s important to stay home when you are sick, and wear a face mask in crowded settings when you think you might be sick or if you have been sick recently. It is also important to practice good hand hygiene by regularly washing your hands with soap and water, and covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow instead of your hand when you cough or sneeze. Will new COVID vaccinations be offered on campus?Faculty and staff should contact their primary care provider or local pharmacy to receive the updated COVID vaccine, which is now available. Students should pay close attention to any communications coming from Vaden and Student Affairs about vaccine availability on and off campus. Overall, we strongly recommend community members stay up-to-date with CDC COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.

Influenza viruses in the B/Yamagata lineage have not been detected since March 2020, when the pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was mushrooming around the world. SARS-CoV-2's explosive viral transmission and the health restrictions that followed drastically disrupted the spread and cycles of other infectious diseases, with seasonal flu being no exception. The 2020-2021 flu season was virtually nonexistent, and the genetic diversity of circulating flu strains dramatically collapsed. But the B/Yamagata lineage looks to have taken the hardest hit. While other strains rebounded in the years since, causing an early and fierce 2022-2023 flu season in the US, B/Yamagata remains missing globally, appearing extinct. In a four-day meeting this week, advisers for WHO met, as usual, to determine the composition of the 2024 influenza seasonal vaccine for the Southern Hemisphere. Their recommendation, released today, is not to include a component to protect against B/Yamagata, marking the first time since its disappearance that the health agency has recommended leaving the absent virus behind. "The absence of confirmed detection of naturally occurring B/Yamagata lineage viruses is indicative of very low risk of infection by B/Yamagata lineage viruses," WHO advisers wrote in their final recommendation. "Therefore, it is the opinion of the WHO influenza vaccine composition advisory committee that inclusion of a B/Yamagata lineage antigen in quadrivalent influenza vaccines is no longer warranted, and every effort should be made to exclude this component as soon as possible." Not only is the virus no longer a detectable threat, but WHO advisers pointed out that as long as vaccines are being produced to fight it—a process that requires growing the virus itself—keeping the vaccine component around could risk reintroducing the virus. "While influenza vaccines are safe and effective, the manufacture and use of inactivated and live attenuated vaccines containing B/Yamagata lineage viruses pose a theoretical risk of reintroduction of B/Yamagata lineage virus into the population. This risk can be mitigated by the removal of B/Yamagata lineage viruses from the vaccines," the advisers wrote. Prior to B/Yamagata's disappearance, there were four types of seasonal flu that circulated globally, and seasonal flu shots took aim at three or four of them (trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, respectively). The four virus types include two influenza type A subtypes, H1N1 and H3N2, and the two influenza type B lineages, Victoria and Yamagata. (For a more detailed explanation of influenza, check out our explainer here.) Trivalent shots have generally protected against both type A viruses and one of the B viruses, which has been the B/Victoria lineage in recent years. The US uses quadrivalent shots. And since the 2023-2024 flu shot composition for the Northern Hemisphere was determined months ago, and shots are now available for this season, they contain a B/Yamagata component.

Ad ChoicesInfluenza Cases Rising Rapidly in Early Start to the Season in Japan | Nippon.com Home Japan Data Influenza Cases Rising Rapidly in Early Start to the Season in Japan Japan Data Influenza Cases Rising Rapidly in Early Start to the Season in Japan Health Society Lifestyle Sep 27, 2023 Japan saw record low numbers of influenza cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, but reduced herd immunity has contributed to an unusually early start to the 2023–24 season. English 日本語 简体字 繁體字 Français Español العربية Русский In a typical influenza season in Japan, cases start to slowly rise from around November before peaking from December to January when it is coldest, and then subsiding. However, the outbreak that began at the end of 2022 continued to the summer of 2023 and without cases subsiding completely, the country is now headed for the peak of another season. This abnormal situation is apparent in the below graph, which shows the number of cases starting to increase two or three months earlier than usual. On September 22, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare published figures for September 11–17, based on reports from 5,000 designated medical institutions across the country. There were 34,665 influenza cases, which was 1.57 times as many as the previous week, or an average of 7.03 per institution. Okinawa Prefecture and Tokyo and its surrounding prefectures were particularly affected. On September 21, Tokyo issued its earliest advisory since statistics were first collected in 1999, and the following day Governor Koike Yuriko called on citizens to be alert, saying, “There’s a strong chance of a major outbreak over the next four weeks.” The 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons saw record low numbers of influenza cases. This is thought to be due to the extensive use of masks and washing and disinfecting of hands adopted to contain COVID-19, measures that were also effective against the spread of influenza. However, the break also led to decreased herd immunity against influenza. The downgrading of COVID-19 to category 5, so that there were no longer recommendations to wear masks, which became a matter of personal choice, and renewed freedom of international travel set up the conditions for a major influenza outbreak. Seniors, people with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women are recommended to consider vaccinations. Other useful preparation includes buying painkillers and antifever medicine, and checking the location of the nearest medical institution providing services to outpatients with fevers.

The research, led by the Doherty Institute and UNSW Sydney, examined these cells in four different age groups: newborns, school-aged children, adults and older adults aged over 60 years of age.‘Complete’ models of human embryos created from stem cells in labRead moreThe lead author, Dr Carolien van de Sandt, a senior research fellow at the Doherty Institute, said it was previously believed that people maintain the same killer T cells throughout their whole life but that these cells became less effective as they became exhausted or “fell asleep” as people become older.However, what the researchers found was that the effective cells found in children and adults actually disappear in the elderly, to be replaced by new cells, which are less able to recognise virus-infected cells.And these new cells displayed gene profiles closely similar to T cells found in newborns, which still need to learn how to recognise influenza viruses, van de Sandt said.“They have the capacity to respond very well,” she said. “They look very similar on the inside like they’re young cells, but the outside is different and doesn’t recognise [virus-infected cells] anymore. It’s almost like they need reading glasses.”Van de Sandt compares the new, less effective cells to having sword swapped with a kitchen knife: “You can learn how to use it, but it will never be as effective.”Prof Katherine Kedzierska of the University of Melbourne, who is head of the human T cell laboratory at the Doherty Institute and a senior author on the paper, said the research will help understand how immunity changes over an individual’s lifespan, which has the potential to significantly advance the science of vaccination.“This study is a turning point for the research into ageing immunity. It has far-reaching implications and opens up new possibilities for the development of better vaccines and therapies tailored to different age groups,” Kedzierska said.This work was conducted in collaboration with Prof Fabio Luciani, co-senior author from UNSW Sydney, said new machine learning methods were used to reconstruct how the influenza virus-specific killer T-cells develop over the lifespan.“As individuals grow, killer T cells get stronger and more effective at eliminating infected cells, but they disappear in older adults, where they are taken over by cells with a lower killing capacity,” Luciani said.Prof James Trauer, the head of epidemiological modelling at Monash University, who was not involved in the research, said “immunity to many pathogens - including influenza and Covid - is clearly strongly influenced by factors other than what we can measure through standard blood tests (ie serology)”.“So understanding cellular immunological processes through studies like these is very important,” Trauer said.Explore more on these topicsScienceVaccines and immunisationHealth (Society)Health (Australia news)newsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUS elections 2024UKClimate crisisUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In addition to the regular residents of the virome and microbiome, infectious agents such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) come and go, and sometimes overlap. RSV can cause acute illness and the virus can sometimes linger. Viruses that stick around can cause chronic conditions such as asthma1, and could potentially change the course of future respiratory infections.

Back to Healio Key takeaways:Only 22%, 23% and 19% of U.S. adults are concerned about getting infected with influenza, COVID-19 and RSV, respectively. Plans for vaccination were similarly low for all three respiratory infections. Despite experts warning of the dangers of influenza, COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus and pneumococcal disease this fall and winter, survey data shows that many U.S. adults underestimate the seriousness of these infections.“The 2023 National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) survey found that many U.S. adults underestimate the seriousness of influenza, COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and pneumococcal disease,” Robert H. Hopkins, Jr., MD, medical director of the NFID, told Healio. Data from NFID. “Results show many adults do not plan to get vaccinated against these respiratory diseases, including those at higher risk for related complications,” Hopkins said.According to data collected in the annual survey recorded by the NFID, although 65% of surveyed U.S. adults believe that annual vaccination is the best protection against influenza, 43% said they do not plan to or are unsure if they will get vaccinated for the 2023-2024 influenza season and just 22% of U.S. adults are concerned about themselves or someone in their family getting infected with influenza. People who said they did not plan on getting vaccinated cited concerns about potential side effects from the vaccine (32%), not trusting the vaccines (31%), not thinking the vaccines work very well (27%) and concerns over getting sick from vaccines (27%) as their top reasons. Hopkins said that September and October are good times to get vaccinated against influenza, but people can still get vaccinated as long as viruses are circulating. “If possible, get vaccinated before flu begins spreading in your community,” he said. In addition to influenza, the NFID survey also explored attitudes toward COVID-19, pneumococcal disease and RSV. Regarding COVID-19, survey data showed that only 23% of U.S. adults are very or extremely concerned about themselves or someone in their family getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 and only 40% plan to get an updated COVID-19 vaccine. Among those not planning on getting the updated vaccine, nearly half (48%) are concerned about side effects, whereas 34% do not trust the vaccine, 28% do not think they work very well, 27% are concerned about getting sick from the vaccine and 13% do not think COVID-19 is a serious illness.“COVID-19 continues to pose a health threat, but we have more and more tools,” CDC Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, said during the annual NFID press conference. “If you look at just in 2023 from January to July, most of the folks who are getting hospitalized from COVID-19 are over the age of 65 and the others are folks with underlying conditions. In fact, 70% of American adults have at least one risk factor that increases your risk for more severe illness from COVID-19,” she said. Earlier this month, the CDC recommended updated COVID-19 vaccines for everyone aged older than 6 months. “As a mom, as a wife, as a daughter, I wouldn't recommend something for the American people that I wouldn't recommend to my own family,” Cohen said. Confounding influenza and COVID-19 vaccine concerns this season is administration. The NFID survey showed that only 38% of U.S. adults would get both vaccines at the same time if offered. More than half (56%) of those surveyed cited concerns of side effects as their primary reasons for not getting both vaccines at the same time, whereas 37% do not think it is safe and 21% have not been advised to get the vaccines together. Data from the survey regarding RSV vaccines showed that only 19% of U.S. adults are concerned about themselves or a loved one getting infected this RSV season, which Cohen explained is already underway and on track with last year’s RSV season, which started early and “increased rapidly” across the country. According to CDC data, an estimated 80,000 children aged younger than 5 years and 160,000 older adults were hospitalized due to RSV, and as many as 300 children aged younger than 5 years and as many as 10,000 older adults died from RSV.“[Cases] are starting here in the southeast,” Cohen said. “But again, the good news here is that we have effective ways to protect ourselves from the worst outcomes of all of these respiratory illnesses.”Unfortunately, uptake of RSV vaccines could be low this upcoming season. According to the survey, only 40% of adults aged 60 years and older plan to get an RSV vaccine, with the top reasons to not get vaccinated being concerns about side effects (33%), not trusting the vaccine (28%) and not having been advised to get an RSV vaccine (27%).Because this is the first year that influenza, COVID-19 and RSV vaccines will be available and recommended for some populations, there are concerns over when the best time to receive the new RSV vaccine is. Hopkins said, though, that the CDC guidance says it is safe to get an RSV vaccine with the other vaccines. Data on this, however, are limited. Because of this, he said, some experts suggest separating vaccinations by 2 weeks, “but there is no contraindication to getting them at the same visit.” For children, 6 months and older, he added, COVID-19 and influenza vaccines may be given at the same visit, whereas current RSV vaccines are not approved for use in children. Nirsevimab is recommended for RSV prevention in children aged younger than 8 months in their first RSV season and certain high-risk children in their second RSV season, though, he said.Panelists at the conference said that influenza season is also the right time to make sure you are up to date on pneumococcal vaccination because pneumococcal disease can be a serious complication of influenza. Unfortunately, only 40% of those at higher risk for pneumococcal disease have been advised to get a pneumococcal vaccine.“We all know that a firm recommendation from a health care practitioner has a powerful impact on persuading people to get vaccinated,” William Schaffner, MD, Infectious Disease News Editorial Board member and professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said during the press conference. “I would urge all of my fellow practitioners to make those recommendations as we go into this vaccination season. And by recommendation, I mean a recommendation with a capital R, not something casual. Let's make it a very committed recommendation,” Schaffner said.Fortunately, the survey showed that among those who have been advised, most (79%) have received a pneumococcal vaccine so far this season.“As health care professionals, we have a responsibility to educate patients about the importance of vaccination to help prevent severe illness and hospitalization,” Hopkins said. “Getting vaccinated against flu and other respiratory diseases this season is the best way to help protect yourself and your loved ones.”.

The season began in week 48 when the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza A cases began to increase. The peak was reached in week 52. The influenza peak overlapped with peaks in reported COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases. As a result, excess all cause mortality was observed between week 50, 2022, and week 2, 2023 among those aged 65 years and older. During the first three weeks of 2023, the number of cases of influenza A decreased quickly, as did all-cause mortality. This was followed by an increase of influenza B/Victoria cases during February and March, which primarily affected younger age groups. The influenza season ended in week 18. Testing and notified cases During the 2022–2023 season, approximately 325,000 samples were analysed for influenza, which is higher than any previous season except 2021–2022. The introduction of combined molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in performed influenza analyses and to a different demography of both tested individuals and laboratory-confirmed cases. In total, 23,015 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were reported, of which 78 percent were influenza A and 22 percent were influenza B. The proportion of positive samples over the whole season was 7 percent. The median age was 51 years for individuals with laboratory-confirmed influenza A and 28 years for influenza B. Of subtyped samples, 53 percent were A(H1)pdm09 and 47 percent were A(H3). Influenza among people 0–39 years of age During the season, the notification rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza was high among children aged 0–4 years compared to the five previous seasons. This was likely due to a combination of increased testing related to the simultaneous RSV peak, as indicated by data regarding testing rates, and high levels of transmission in this age group, shown in calls for medical advice regarding fever in this age group. The number of influenza cases in intensive care among children 0–4 years (34 patients) was also substantially higher than during the previous four epidemic seasons (average 12 patients per season). Because of lower-than-usual spread of influenza during the COVID-19 pandemic, many younger children had not yet been exposed to influenza, meaning this age group likely saw high transmission during both influenza A and B dominant periods of the season. Similarly, age groups 5–14 years and 15–39 years had higher rates of notification of laboratory-confirmed influenza and a higher number of patients in intensive care compared with the previous five seasons. Half of patients 5–39 years of age in intensive care had influenza B. Cluster of severe influenza B cases During March 2023, a small number of epidemiologically linked cases of influenza B with severe complications were reported among adolescents, prompting activities at the regional and national level, including a national investigation. The investigation aimed to identify other similar cases, as well as assess whether the number of influenza B cases with severe complications was higher than expected, and whether there was any common contributing cause beyond influenza infection or any viral factors associated with the observed severe complications. Thus far, the investigation has not identified any virological or other explanation for the cases, beyond high influenza transmission. Although severe cases are expected during influenza epidemics, the cluster remains unusual. See Appendix 1, Investigation of severe complications of influenza B among adolescents. Severe outcomes of influenza infection A total of 353 patients in intensive care with laboratory-confirmed influenza were reported during the season. The highest number of admissions to intensive care was in week 52 (69 patients) and was higher than the peaks of the previous five seasons. A majority (80 percent) of the patients with influenza in intensive care during 2022–2023 were infected with influenza A. Among the 43 samples subtyped, there was an even distribution of influenza A(H1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3). A total of 603 confirmed cases were reported to have died within 30 days of influenza diagnosis, with a median age of 83 years. The weekly number of deaths reached the highest numbers in weeks 1 and 2, 2023, with 73 and 79 deaths, respectively. Deaths occurred mainly during the influenza A-dominant period of the season, and 93 percent of the deaths had influenza A. Among influenza cases, 3 percent of influenza A cases and less than one percent of influenza B died within 30 days of diagnosis. Among persons aged 65 years and older with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B, approximately 8 percent died within 30 days. Sentinel surveillance In sentinel surveillance, 77 of 322 analysed samples were positive for influenza (24 percent). Of these, 61 were influenza A (79 percent) and the remaining 16 samples were influenza B/Victoria. Of the influenza A positives, 59 percent were influenza A(H3), with the rest being influenza A(H1)pdm09. Virus characterisation A selection of influenza-positive samples received from clinical laboratories and collected through sentinel surveillance are further analysed at the PHAS. During the season, the HA gene of 285 viruses has been characterised for genetic group affiliation, including 89 A(H3N2), 101 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 95 B/Victoria influenza viruses. The majority of influenza A(H3N2) viruses belonged to the same genetic subgroup (3C.2a1b.2a.2a) as the viruses included in the northern hemisphere vaccines 2022–2023. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that were analysed belonged to subgroups 5a.2a and 5a.2a.1, which are poorly recognised by human post-vaccination sera raised against the vaccine viruses (subgroup 5a.2) indicating mismatch. As a result, the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the northern hemisphere vaccines 2023–2024 has been changed to subgroup 5a.2a.1. Characterised B/Victoria-viruses belonged to genetic subgroup V1A.3a.2, which is the same genetic subgroup as the vaccine virus. The NA gene of 286 viruses was characterised. In 285 of these, no amino acid substitutions previously shown to result in reduced or highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir or zanamivir were detected. One (H1N1)pdm09 isolate carried a minority variant of amino acid substitution N295S, which is associated with reduced or highly reduced inhibition for oseltamivir. No decreased baloxavir susceptibility was detected in the PA gene of 277 viruses analysed. Influenza vaccination This season, the influenza vaccination campaign began on November 8, 2022, but vaccination of people living in care homes began in the end of October. Until December 5th, risk groups and health care workers were prioritized. Vaccination coverage against influenza among persons aged 65 years or older was estimated at 63 percent, which is higher than the six seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic (49–53 percent), but lower than the 2021–2022 season (70 percent). Sammanfattning Säsongen 2022–2023 var blandad med spridning av influensa A(H1N1)pdm09, influensa A(H3N2) och influensa B/Victoria. Den startade vecka 48 då antalet laboratoriebekräftade influensa A-fall började öka. Toppen nåddes vecka 52. Influenstoppen överlappade med toppar i rapporterade fall av covid-19 och RS-virus. Som ett resultat sågs en överdödlighet mellan vecka 50 och vecka 2 bland personer 65 år och äldre. Under de första tre veckorna av 2023 minskade antalet fall av influensa A snabbt, liksom överdödligheten. Detta följdes av en ökning av fall av influensa B/Victoria under februari och mars, vilket främst drabbade yngre åldersgrupper. Influensasäsongen avslutades vecka 18. Provtagning och bekräftade fall Under säsongen 2022–2023 analyserades cirka 325 000 prover för influensa, vilket är fler än någon tidigare säsong förutom 2021–2022. Under pandemin av covid-19 infördes kombinerade molekylära tester för SARS-CoV-2, influensa och RS-virus, och det har lett till en ökning av utförda influensaanalyser och en förändrad demografi när det gäller både provtagna individer och laboratoriebekräftade fall. Totalt rapporterades 23 015 laboratoriebekräftade influensafall, varav 78 procent var influensa A och 22 procent influensa B. Andelen positiva prover över hela säsongen var 7 procent. Medianåldern för individer med laboratoriebekräftad influensa A var 51 år och 28 år för influensa B. Av subtypade influensa A-prover var 53 procent influensa A(H1)pdm09 och 47 procent var influensa A(H3). Influensa bland personer 0–39 år Bland barn 0–4 år rapporterades många laboratoriebekräftade influensafall per 100 000 invånare, jämfört med de fem föregående säsongerna. Detta berodde sannolikt på en kombination av ökad provtagning på grund av den samtidiga RS-virustoppen, vilket testningsdata tyder på, och hög smittspridning i denna åldersgrupp, vilket syns i samtal till 1177 om små barn med feber. Antalet barn 0–4 år som vårdades inom intensivvården (34 patienter) var också betydligt högre än under de föregående fyra säsongerna med influensaspridning (i genomsnitt 12 patienter per säsong). På grund av lägre influensaspridning under covid-19-pandemin hade många yngre barn ännu inte exponerats för influensa, vilket innebär att denna åldersgrupp sannolikt smittades i hög grad under både den influensa A och B-dominerade perioden av säsongen. Även i åldersgrupperna 5–14 år och 15–39 år sågs ett högre antal laboratoriebekräftade fall av influensa per 100 000 och fler patienter som vårdades inom intensivvården, jämfört med de fem föregående säsongerna. Hälften av patienterna 5–39 år inom intensivvården hade influensa B. Kluster av allvarliga influensa B-fall Under mars 2023 rapporterades bland ungdomar ett litet antal epidemiologiskt kopplade fall av influensa B med allvarliga komplikationer, vilket ledde till aktiviteter på regional och nationell nivå, inklusive en nationell utredning. Syftet med utredningen var att identifiera andra liknande fall samt bedöma om antalet influensa B-fall med allvarliga komplikationer var högre än förväntat, och om det fanns någon gemensam bidragande orsak i detta kluster, utöver influensainfektion, eller om några virusfaktorer var kopplade till komplikationerna. Hittills har utredningen inte identifierat någon virologisk eller annan förklaring till fallen, utöver hög smittspridning. Även om allvarliga fall förväntas under influensaepidemier, är klustret fortfarande ovanligt. Se Appendix 1, Investigation of severe complications of influenza B among adolescents. Allvarliga utfall av influensainfektion Totalt rapporterades 353 patienter med laboratoriebekräftad influensa inom intensivvården under säsongen. Det högsta antalet nyinläggningar var vecka 52 (69 patienter), och det var högre än topparna under de fem föregående säsongerna. En majoritet (80 procent) av de intensivvårdade patienterna med influensa under 2022–2023 hade influensa A. Bland de 43 subtypade proverna sågs en jämn fördelning av influensa A(H1)pdm09 och influensa A(H3). Totalt 603 personer med bekräftade influensa rapporterades ha avlidit inom 30 dagar efter diagnosen, med en medianålder på 83 år. Flest avled under vecka 1 och 2 med 73 respektive 79 personer. Dödsfallen inträffade främst under den influensa A-dominerande perioden av säsongen, och 93 procent av de avlidna hade också influensa A. Bland personer med bekräftad influensa hade 3 procent av dem med influensa A, och mindre än 1 procent av personerna med influensa B, avlidit inom 30 dagar efter diagnosen. Bland personer 65 år och äldre med laboratoriebekräftad influensa A eller B hade cirka 8 procent avlidit inom 30 dagar. Sentinelövervakning Inom sentinelövervakningen var 77 av 322 analyserade prover positiva för influensa (24 procent). Av dessa var 61 influensa A (79 procent) medan de återstående 16 proverna var influensa B/Victoria. Av de influensa A-positiva var fördelningen 59 procent influensa A(H3) och 41 procent influensa A(H1)pdm09. Viruskaraktärisering Ett urval av influensapositiva prover som tas emot från kliniska laboratorier eller samlas in genom sentinelövervakningen analyseras vidare vid Folkhälsomyndigheten. Under säsongen karaktäriserades hemagglutiningenen (HA) hos 285 stammar med efterföljande analys av genetisk grupptillhörighet. Bland dessa ingick följande influensastammar: 89 influensa A(H3N2)-stammar, 101 influensa A(H1N1)pdm09-stammar och 95 influensa B/Victoria-stammar. Majoriteten av de karaktäriserade influensa A(H3N2)-stammarna tillhörde samma genetiska subgrupp (3C.2a1b.2a.2a) som vaccinstammen för norra halvklotet 2022–2023. Karaktäriserade influensa A(H1N1)pdm09-virus tillhörde subgrupp 5a.2a och undergrupp 5a.2a.1. I humanserologiska analyser med post-vaccinationsserum (efter vaccination med de vaccinstammar som rekommenderades för norra halvklotet 2022–2023) påvisades dåligt skydd mot dessa grupper och därför har vaccinstammen i vaccinen för 2023–2024 bytts till undergrupp 5a.2a.1. Karaktäriserade B/Victoria-virus tillhörde den genetiska undergruppen V1A.3a.2, vilket är samma genetiska undergrupp som vaccinstammen. Neuraminidas-genen (NA) för 286 influensastammar karaktäriserades. I 285 av dessa upptäcktes inga aminosyrasubstitutioner som tidigare visat sig resultera i reducerad eller mycket reducerad känslighet för neuraminidashämmare. Ett influensa A(H1N1)pdm09-isolat bar dock på en minoritetsvariant av aminosyrasubstitution N295S, som är associerad med reducerad eller mycket reducerad känslighet för neuraminidashämmare. Ingen minskad känslighet för baloxavir upptäcktes i PA-genen (polymerase acidic subunit) hos 277 analyserade virus. Influensavaccination Höstens allmänna vaccinationsinsatser mot säsongsinfluensa inleddes den 8 november 2022 (vecka 45). Vaccination av personer på särskilda boenden för äldre påbörjades i slutet av oktober. Fram till den 5 december prioriterades riskgrupper tillsammans med vård- och omsorgspersonal. Vaccinationstäckningen mot influensa bland personer 65 år och äldre uppskattas till 63 procent, vilket är högre än de sex säsongerna före covid-19-pandemin (49–53 procent) men lägre än säsongen 2021–2022 (70 procent). About this publication This report describes the monitoring systems for influenza in use during the 2022–2023 winter season and the results of both epidemiological and virological surveillance. Data are also compared to previous influenza seasons. The report has been prepared for the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of the Public Health Agency of Sweden’s function as a National Influenza Centre (NIC). Annual reports in English about the influenza seasons in Sweden have been available since 1997, and those from 2014–2015 onward can be found on the Public Health Agency’s website (suggested search “Influenza in Sweden”) (1).Public Health Agency of SwedenLena DillnerHead of UnitUnit for Laboratory Surveillance of Viral Pathogens and Vaccine Preventable DiseasesAnneli CarlanderHead of UnitUnit for Coordination and Surveillance of Seasonal Viruses Influenza surveillance in Sweden Influenza epidemics recur in Sweden during winter, with a range of effects depending on the characteristics of the circulating viruses and the level of immunity in different age groups. In order to get an overall picture of on-going influenza activity and to remain prepared in case of a pandemic, the Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhälsomyndigheten) (PHAS) has a number of different epidemiological reporting systems for influenza ranging from the collection of data from different healthcare providers to the analysis of web searches. Virological surveillance provides additional data on occurrence and provides detailed information on typing and resistance in circulating strains. Viruses are typed as influenza A or B by regional laboratories in real time during the influenza season, and some laboratories also determine the subtype for influenza A. Throughout the season, a selection of viruses from around the country are characterised at the PHAS laboratory. PHAS performs real-time PCR, whole genome sequencing and NAI (neuraminidase inhibition assay) with regard to subtype and lineage, genetic group affiliation, vaccine similarity, and sensitivity to antiviral drugs. Viruses are also isolated and sent to the WHO Collaborating Centre (WHOCC) in London for further characterisation and to provide a basis for vaccine strain selection. When new strains of influenza virus emerge, reference methods for diagnostics are established at the PHAS and shared with all microbiological laboratories in Sweden. During the influenza season, the PHAS condenses national and international data into a detailed weekly bulletin that is published on the agency’s website (2). The bulletin provides timely analysis and assessment of the current situation in Sweden and abroad and has a wide readership. Updates to national policies and recommendations During the 2022–2023 season, updated web-based information about vaccinations and influenza was published in August 2022. The revision included updated recommendations about prioritization for vaccination, reinforced vaccines for people in long-term care facilities, and information about co-vaccination for influenza and COVID-19 (3). Current recommendations for influenza vaccination of risk groups (in Swedish) Surveillance 2022–2023 The surveillance pyramid below illustrates the different outcomes and levels of severity and the corresponding surveillance systems for individuals infected with influenza (Figure 1), ranging from the large number of infected individuals to the small number who die due to influenza infection. Table 1 describes the data collection systems that the PHAS used to monitor influenza activity at the various levels of the pyramid in Sweden during the 2022–2023 season and shows a summary of the results of each system. Each system is described further at the start of each section of this report. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact influenza surveillance during the season, with changes to healthcare seeking and testing behaviour. The integration of influenza and COVID-19 surveillance is ongoing, along with the integration of RSV surveillance. Table 2 shows at which week each system, as applicable, crossed the threshold for epidemic start and when it reached its peak notation, as well as the maximum intensity level measured by the system during the season. When possible, quantitative thresholds for epidemic start and end, as well as intensity levels (low, medium, high, very high) are calculated based on data from previous seasons using the moving epidemic method (4). Some intensity thresholds have been affected by increased testing and are therefore likely to inadequately reflect seasonal intensity. Figure 1. The surveillance pyramid showing possible outcomes of an influenza infection and the surveillance systems at each level. Please note that mandatory laboratory reporting, number sampled and virus characterisation includes all levels from sought healthcare and above, if patients are sampled. Table 1.

The data are from the period of week 40, 2022, to week 20, 2023, if no other dates are given. Reporting system/method Implementation What does the system/method show? Results (2022–2023) Mandatory laboratory reporting of identified influenza cases including sub-/lineage typing results if available. Legal obligation for all laboratories to report case-based influenza diagnoses along with full patient identity in the web-based reporting system – SmiNet – in accordance with the Communicable Diseases Act. Number of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A and B together with age, gender, and geographical distribution. Influenza virus and sub-/lineage type distribution. 17,848 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A and 5,167 cases of influenza B. In total, 78 percent influenza A and 22 percent influenza B. Of influenza A cases subtyped, 53 percent A(H1)pdm09 and 47 percent A(H3). Of Influenza B cases with determined lineage, 0 percent B/Yamagata and 100 percent B/Victoria. Voluntary laboratory reporting of samples tested Voluntary reporting of the number of samples tested with aggregated data sent via email. Number of tested and proportion of samples tested that are positive 324,112 samples tested with 7 percent positive. Antiviral sales Weekly data from the Swedish eHealth Agency Number of packages of oseltamivir and zanamivir sold by type of sale, including prescriptions and health care requisitions. 17,839 packages of oseltamivir and zanamivir Voluntary clinical reporting of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases (all types) in intensive care (SIRI) Collaboration with the Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR). Treating physicians in intensive care units voluntarily report clinical information about patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Severity of infections by different influenza subtypes and impact on the intensive care units. 353 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza were reported from SIRI. Of those, 281 were reported as influenza A and 72 were influenza B. Excess mortality models Weekly data on the aggregated number of deaths in Sweden, by age group, is sent from the Swedish Tax Agency to the Public Health Agency and analysed with a statistical model. All-cause mortality (EuroMoMo model) Excess mortality was seen from week 50, 2022, to week 2, 2023, in the total population and particularly in the age group 65 years and older. Deaths within 30 days Weekly data on date of death are sent from the Swedish Tax Agency to the Public Health Agency, linked to influenza registries, and analysed intermittently. Death within 30 days of influenza diagnosis 603 of 23,082 persons with a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis died within 30 days of diagnosis, of which 93 percent were influenza A. Most (90 percent) were aged 65 years and older. Sentinel sampling Samples taken by Primary Care GPs from some patients who present with influenza-like illness (ILI), as well as some patients with acute respiratory illness (ARI), are analysed by the Public Health Agency for influenza (and SARS-CoV-2). The proportion of sentinel patients with ILI or ARI who have an influenza infection (see also virus characterisation below). 322 samples were analysed, of which 77 (24 percent) tested positive for influenza. Of these, 79 percent were influenza A and 21 percent influenza B, of which all were B/Victoria, (0 percent B/Yamagata). Of influenza A positives, 53 percent were influenza A(H3) and 47 percent were A(H1)pdm09. In total, 81 percent of the patients had clinical symptoms of ILI. Genotypic and phenotypic characterisation Continual genotypic and phenotypic analysis of a selection of influenza-positive laboratory and sentinel samples. Genetic group affiliation, genetic vaccine similarity, and susceptibility to antiviral drugs among the viruses selected for characterisation. In total, genetic group affiliation has been determined for 285 viruses. The majority (71 percent) of the A(H3N2) viruses analysed belonged to the same genetic subgroup as the vaccine viruses included in the northern hemisphere vaccines 2022–2023. The characterised A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonged to a subgroup poorly recognised by human post-vaccination sera raised against the vaccine viruses. B/Victoria viruses belonged to the same genetic group as the vaccine viruses. Genotypically, no reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir or zanamivir was identified (in 90 A(H3N2), 101 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 94 B/Vic analysed viruses) or to baloxavir (in 87 A(H3N2), 100 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 90 B/Vic analysed viruses). In one A(H1N1)pdm09 sample the N295S substitution was detected as a minority variant. N295S in NA is associated with reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. No reduced sensitivity to zanamivir was detected in this sample. The amino acid substitution S31N in the matrix gene conferring resistance to amantadine was identified in all 199 analysed influenza A viruses. Vaccination coverage Periodic collection of coverage data from each region. Vaccination coverage per age group. 63 percent coverage among those 65 years or older Web Search (Webbsök, data from medical advice site 1177.se) An automated system that uses search data from the national medical advice site 1177.se. The numbers of searches for influenza and influenza symptoms are entered into a statistical model that estimates the proportion of patients with ILI visiting general practitioners. Estimates the proportion of patients with ILI. Between week 27, 2022, and week 26, 2023, a total of 291,966 queries related to influenza were entered, which was 4 percent of the total number of queries on the 1177.se website. National medical advice telephone line 1177 (Hälsoläge) The weekly aggregated data on the primary reason for contacting the medical advice line (phone number 1177) and the age groups of the patients are reported to the Public Health Agency. Symptoms recorded as the primary reason for contacting the medical advice line by age group (adults and children).This data system was unavailable Feb–Jun 2023. During the peak week (week 51, 2022), 14 percent of calls were due to fever in children (0–17 years of age). For children under 4 years the peak week was also week 51 with 41 percent of the calls.

(c) This data system was unavailable Feb-Jun 2023 so no end of season could be calculated. Laboratory-based surveillance Testing for influenza During the 2022–2023 season, approximately 325 000 samples were analysed for influenza, which was higher than previous seasons except 2021–2022, see Figure 2. The highest number of weekly samples were analysed in weeks 50–52, 2022 (approximately 18,000–21,000 samples per week). This period also saw the season’s highest levels of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV cases. Testing for influenza is performed using molecular methods, predominately PCR-based tests. Data on the total number of samples analysed are reported voluntarily by the laboratories to the PHAS. As less expensive and faster PCR systems for influenza testing have become available, testing has expanded from mainly hospital settings to also include outpatient care, including primary care. The introduction of combined molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in testing and to a different demography of tested individuals. People with milder symptoms have been tested to a larger extent than before the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly older children and adults under 65 years of age (conclusion based on a subset of RSV-denominator data that are disaggregated by age group, not shown). In turn, more laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported among these age groups than in seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic, see also Age and sex distribution of cases.Figure 2. Number of samples analysed for influenza data per week, per season, 2018–2023. Laboratory-confirmed influenza cases During the fall of 2022, the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases was very low, but cases began to increase as November progressed. The epidemic started in week 48 (Figure 3), as determined through threshold values set (see section on Influenza surveillance in Sweden), which was within the normal period and the same week as the previous season. The number of influenza A cases increased quickly during the first weeks of December and peaked in week 52 with 3,308 cases reported. Around this time, RSV and COVID-19 also reached the highest levels for the season, see Figure 4.During the first three weeks of 2023, the number of cases of influenza A decreased quickly. This was followed by an increase of influenza B cases during February that reached a peak in week 12, although the peak was smaller than that of influenza A. The influenza epidemic ended in week 18, but sporadic cases continued to be reported through the summer. In total, 23,015 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were reported between week 40, 2022, and week 20, 2023, of which 17,848 cases (78 percent) were influenza A and 5,167 cases (22 percent) were influenza B, see Table 3. Because of increased sampling, the number of reported cases per week or in total was not comparable with the seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first weeks of the 2022–2023 season, the sampling was similar to that of the 2021–2022 season. However, after reaching its highest level in December, sampling decreased, see Figure 2, likely as an effect of changes in testing strategy for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 7 percent of the samples taken during the season were positive for influenza, which was lower compared to seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the high levels of testing, see Table 3. The highest percentage of positive samples was seen in week 52 at 17 percent, see Figure 5. The increase of influenza B seen during the spring was also reflected in an increased positivity, reaching 10–11 percent in weeks 6–12, 2023. Figure 3. Total number of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza (all types) per week and the dominating influenza type(s) per season, 2017–2018 to 2022–2023. Figure 4.

Viral distribution During the 2022–2023 season, 23,015 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, of which the majority were influenza A (78 percent). Table 3 summarises the laboratory reporting results over the last six seasons, including the number of analysed samples and the proportion of positive samples as well as the total number of positive samples by type.Table 3. Laboratory results of samples analysed and reported through the laboratory reporting system over the last six seasons.Indicator2017–20182018–20192019–20202020–20212021–20222022–2023Analysed samples88,83783,32575,819175,048425,423324,112Proportion positive samples (percent)2317110.0237Total positive for influenza A7,40613,6645,4411013,15017,848Total positive for influenza B13,280932,500191375,167 Age and sex distribution Overall, the highest weekly and cumulative notification rate (week 40, 2022 – week 20, 2023) of laboratory-confirmed influenza and of influenza A was seen among children aged 0–4 years old and persons aged 65 years and older, see Figures 6 and 7. These age groups are typically most affected by severe illness in an influenza epidemic. The highest weekly and cumulative notification rate of influenza B was seen among children aged 0–4 years old and children aged 5–14 years old, see Figure 8, while the lowest notification rate was seen among those 65 years and older. The median age for influenza A and B was 51 and 28 years, respectively, see Table 4. More women (55 percent) than men (45 percent) had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Because of lower-than-usual spread of influenza during the COVID-19 pandemic, many younger children had not yet been exposed to influenza, meaning more were susceptible to infection. This age group saw high notification rates during both influenza A and B-dominant periods of the season. Data from telephone calls for medical advice regarding fever among children showed very high levels in the weeks leading up to this peak, when both COVID-19 and influenza were circulating widely (see the section Telephone advice line data). Overall, the cumulative notification rate of all influenza cases was higher among children aged 0–4 years than in previous seasons, likely due to a combination of increased testing and high levels of influenza transmission. The highest weekly notification rate was seen in week 52, when influenza A dominated the season, and it was higher than previous seasons, see Figure 9. The highest notification rate of influenza B was seen in weeks 8 and 11–13, and reached similar levels to the 2019–2020 season, which was when B/Victoria last circulated, see Figure 10, although the cumulative notification rate was higher in 2022–2023. Compared with the intense B/Yamagata season of 2017–2018, the cumulative notification rate was comparable, although the peak was lower.Among persons 5–14 years and 15–39 years, the cumulative notification rate of influenza A was higher than seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic because testing of these groups has increased compared with those seasons, but peaks were lower than the 2021–2022 season when testing in society was even more widespread. Among those 40–64 years, the cumulative notification rate of influenza A was higher during the 2022–2023 season than all previous seasons, indicating higher transmission despite lower testing. For those aged 5–14 years and 15–39 years, the cumulative notification rate of influenza B was higher in the 2022–2023 season compared with 2017–2018, while the notification rate was considerably lower among those aged 40–64 years. During March 2023, several cases with severe complications associated with influenza B infection were reported among adolescents, leading to a national investigation (see Appendix 1, Investigation of severe complications of influenza B among adolescents). Among those 65 years and older, the cumulative notification rate was similar to the medium-intensity 2018–2019 season. However, the highest weekly number of cases of influenza A, in week 52, 2022, was similar to that of the intense peak in 2017–2018, during which B/Yamagata circulated, see Figure 11. Given increased testing it is likely that more milder cases were tested than in seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic. As noted, the cumulative notification rate of influenza B was low, which is likely explained by the fact that people 65 years and older have higher immunity towards influenza B/Victoria as compared with a B/Yamagata. Table 5 shows the number of cases per and notification rate per type and narrower age groups. Season 2020–2021 is excluded from the figures below due to the small number of cases.Table 4.

Weekly notification rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza (dominating type only, as shown in the legend) for individuals aged 65 and older in Sweden, 2017–2018 to 2022–2023. Geographic distribution There were marked geographical differences within Sweden in the spread of influenza during the season. From week 48, 2022, to week 2, 2023, the highest cumulative notification rate (per 100,000 population) of influenza A was seen in the northern parts of Sweden (Norrland), with a peak in week 52, 2022, see Figure 12. The peaks in the middle and southern parts of Sweden (Svealand and Götaland) occurred in the same week, but these were not as high as in Norrland. The percentage of samples positive for influenza had peaks in week 52 for all parts of Sweden. In the first weeks of January, cases of influenza A decreased in all parts of Sweden.As cases of influenza A declined in January 2023, an increase of influenza B cases was seen in all parts of Sweden, with the highest notification rate in the middle parts of Sweden (Svealand), where cases peaked in week 13, 2023, see Figure 13. The notification rate reached its highest levels in week 12 in the southern parts of Sweden (Götaland) and week 15 in the northern parts (Norrland). The geographical differences in the number of laboratory-confirmed cases might have been affected by healthcare-seeking behaviour as well as differences in sampling routines in the various regions. Figure 12. Weekly notification rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza A per 100,000 population and region from week 40, 2022, to week 20, 2023. Figure 13. Weekly notification rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza B per 100,000 population and region from week 40, 2022, to week 20, 2023. Antiviral sales The PHAS receives weekly data from the Swedish eHealth Agency on the previous week's sales of the two most common antivirals used for influenza prophylaxis and treatment (zanamivir and oseltamivir). Data include dispensed prescription medications prescribed in outpatient care and healthcare requisitions (mainly medication used in inpatient care/hospitals). Data on prescriptions reflect patients receiving medical care for influenza-like symptoms, whereas requisitions are a combination of hospitals stocking up in preparation for intense periods as well as ongoing treatment of influenza patients. Sales are presented in terms of number of packages, with each package representing one patient course of treatment. Cumulative sales of zanamivir and oseltamivir were at higher levels compared to the last season 2021–2022, but lower than during the last intensive influenza season of 2017–2018 (Table 6). Approximately 17,800 packages of antivirals were sold this season, compared with 7,000 packages for the same period in the 2021–2022 season. The season saw an increase in health care requisitions as a proportion of all sales, making up about 77 percent of the packages sold. In the previous five seasons, the corresponding figure has ranged between 58 and 69 percent. This may indicate an increased use of antivirals in in-patient care, as well as preparations for an intense season. The Swedish Medical Products Agency published updated recommendations regarding antiviral use for prophylaxis and treatment in June 2022 (5). During the 2022–2023 season, sales increased steeply in the beginning of December (week 49) coinciding with an increase in notified influenza cases. This increase was seen in both requisitions and in prescriptions. After this period, sales roughly followed the pattern of influenza cases, decreasing through January but remaining elevated until the end of the season, see Figure 14. Sales of antivirals were lower than the number of influenza cases during the 2022–2023 season. Figure 14. Total sales of the antivirals zanamivir and oseltamivir per week, all sales methods, five seasons. Table 6.

A special reporting module in the registry, known as SIRI, allows reporting of patients at an intensive care unit with laboratory-confirmed influenza or COVID-19. The module includes individual factors on underlying medical conditions, complications, antiviral treatment, vaccination status, influenza type and subtype, and other data for patients undergoing treatment. During the 2022–2023 season, 353 patients with influenza were reported as having received intensive care (Table 7), which is similar to the 2018–2019 season when both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) circulated. Compared to the two previous seasons, the number of patients was higher. Of patients during the 2022–2023 season, 80 percent (281 patients) had influenza A and 20 percent (72 patients) had influenza B. Of 43 subtyped samples, 51 percent were influenza A(H1)pdm09 and the remainder were influenza A(H3). The greatest number of patients were admitted to intensive care during the peak of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza in week 52 (71 patients, see Figure 15). The majority of influenza A cases were admitted in the first part of the season, and the cases with influenza B were admitted from January onward. The highest incidence of intensive care per 100,000 population was seen among those 65 years or older and among children aged 0–4 years, see Figure 16 below, particularly due to influenza A. The age groups 0–4 years, 5–14 years and 15–39 years saw a substantially higher incidence of intensive care than the previous five seasons, while those aged 40–64 and 65 years and older were within the range of these seasons (Table 8). Nearly all patients 65 years or older who received intensive care had influenza A. The median age for patients with influenza A admitted to intensive care was 60 years, while it was 28 years for patients with influenza B (Table 9). In total, 54 percent of the patients were women and 46 percent were men. There were 71 patients under the age of 18 years. Of all reported cases in intensive care with laboratory-confirmed influenza, 40 percent had influenza as the primary diagnosis in intensive care, and another 55 percent had influenza as a secondary diagnosis, with just over half of these having a circulatory or pulmonary code as the primary diagnosis code. Approximately 2 percent did not have influenza as a primary or secondary diagnosis, and for 3 percent the diagnosis codes were missing. The proportion of patients with primary diagnosis of influenza was 34 percent among those 65 years and older and 47 percent among those aged 0–4 years among all cases in intensive care with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Of all reported cases in intensive care, 238 patients (67 percent) were in a risk group for severe influenza illness, either due to age (65 years and older) or due to having one or more medical risk factors. Chronic lung disease (26 percent), diabetes (20 percent) and chronic heart disease (19 percent) were the most commonly reported medical risk factors among patients in intensive care during the season. Among patients 65 years and older, approximately 19 percent did not have a medical risk factor. Among patients under the age of 65 years, half (115 patients, 50 percent) did not have a medical risk factor. Three patients were pregnant, of which one had influenza A and two had influenza B. Vaccination status was known for 95 patients who were in risk groups and therefore recommended vaccination. Of these, 27 patients (28 percent) were vaccinated this season and the majority (67 percent) of the vaccinated patients were aged 65 years or older. The proportion of vaccinated was higher among those aged 65 years and above (39 percent) compared to those aged under 65 years (18 percent). The median age for vaccinated patients was 73 years. Of the patients requiring intensive care, seven were reported to have received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment. However, this number is known to be subject to under-reporting.

Season 2020–2021 is not included due to the small number of cases. Incidence of patients in intensive care with influenza To enable comparison with the past seasons, we estimated the weekly incidence of patients in intensive care with influenza based on preliminary estimates of regional catchment population denominators. The highest peak in week 52, 2022, was higher than that of the previous five seasons (Figure 17). However, the cumulative incidence over the entire season was lower than the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 seasons (Figure 18). Figure 17.

Cumulative incidence of patients with influenza in intensive care per week over the last five seasons, 2017–2023. Dominant type indicated above each seasonal line. Season 2020–2021 not included due to low numbers. Influenza-related mortality Influenza-related mortality is often noted during influenza seasons and varies with circulating strains and the intensity of the season. The PHAS uses different systems to measure influenza-related mortality: deaths within 30 days of influenza diagnosis, and excess crude (all cause) mortality. Data on laboratory-confirmed influenza patients are intermittently linked to Swedish Tax Agency data on death in order to identify deceased individuals and to retrieve their dates of death. If 30 days or fewer have elapsed since the influenza diagnosis, the death is considered to be influenza related. One disadvantage of this method is that, because the cause of death is not considered, some deaths might be due to other causes than influenza, especially in older populations where overall mortality is high. Moreover, the measurement only includes deaths where influenza diagnosis was laboratory confirmed. Therefore, there are most likely a large number of unrecorded deaths from influenza. In addition, the data do not include information about underlying risk factors or complications of influenza infection. The analysis below includes data on cases reported until June 28, 2023 (Sunday week 25). Status after 30 days could not be ascertained for 301 cases that were missing a national identification number. In order to identify crude (all cause) excess mortality during the influenza season, data on deceased individuals is transferred from the Swedish Tax Agency each week and analysed by the PHAS as part of the European monitoring of excess mortality for public health action (EuroMoMo) collaboration. The EuroMoMo model estimates the crude excess mortality for the whole country by age group and regionally, compared to baseline expected levels. Excess mortality during the winter may be related to influenza and other respiratory infections or to periods of extremely cold temperatures. Deaths within 30 days of influenza diagnosis In total, 603 of 23,082 persons who received a laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis during the 2022–2023 season died within 30 days of diagnosis. This corresponds to 2.6 percent of the laboratory-confirmed cases, which is slightly lower compared to the four seasons before the COVID pandemic for which this analysis has been possible (range 2.7–4.9 percent, see Table 10). The majority of these deaths (77 percent) occurred within 15 days of diagnosis.Patients who died within 30 days of diagnosis had a median age of 83 years, whereas patients who survived at least 30 days after diagnosis had a median age of 40 years. This reflects the high burden of severe influenza illness among the elderly. The median age for patients who died with influenza A and B was similar at 83 and 84 years, respectively. In total, 8 percent of all people aged 65 and older who had laboratory-verified influenza died within 30 days, which is within the range of previous seasons (7–9 percent). Most of those who died (90 percent) were aged 65 years and older. Of deaths occurring within 30 days of diagnosis, the majority had an influenza A diagnosis (563 people, 93 percent). This corresponds to 3 percent of influenza A cases. Among influenza B cases, 40 deaths were reported, see Figure 19, corresponding to less than 1 percent of cases. None of those who died were reported with both influenza A and B. For most of those with influenza A who died within 30 days, subtype was not determined (89 percent, 501 patients), while 36 cases had influenza A(H3N2) and 26 cases had influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Of those who had not died within 30 days, 78 percent had influenza A, and 22 percent had influenza B, while less than 0.5 percent had both influenza A and B (54 cases). The median age of survivors was 49 years for influenza A and 28 years for influenza B. Slightly more women than men died within 30 days of an influenza diagnosis (54 percent of the deaths were among women), but the difference was not statistically significant. Figure 19. Deaths among laboratory-confirmed influenza cases per week of death, 2022–2023 season. The figure does not include a small number of deaths occurring after week 20. Table 10.

Median age is not calculated due to low numbers. In total, approximately 90 percent of deaths within 30 days occurred among people aged 65 years or older, while 7 percent of deaths occurred among adults aged 40–64 years and 3 percent occurred among people under the age of 40 years, see Table 11. The proportion of deaths within 30 days increased with increasing age and varied from 0.2 percent for persons aged under 40 years to 21 percent for people 95 years and older. The analyses were not adjusted for expected mortality per age group. Table 11.

It excludes 301 patients whose personal identification number was not included in the case report, meaning that their status at 30 days could not be ascertained. It also excludes 9 cases without known age. Excess mortality The PHAS monitors all cause excess mortality nationally and per age group and region through the EuroMOMO model. This model indicated significant excess mortality at the national level between week 50, 2022, and week 2, 2023, for the entire population, and particularly among those 65 years and older, see Figure 20. The extensive spread of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV is believed to have been the main cause of the excess mortality. Influenza-related mortality is more often seen in the age group 65 years and older because older people are at the greatest risk of dying from influenza. Similar trends were seen on the European level. Figure 20. Number of crude and expected (baseline) deaths per week in the age group 65 years and older, Sweden, 2017 (week 27) to 2023 (week 26). Sentinel sampling A network of sentinel sampling sites for influenza surveillance was established in Sweden in 1999 and the active sentinel sampling sites during 2022–2023 were general practitioners (GPs). Virological analysis of samples from sentinel sites contributes to national and international surveillance of circulating influenza viruses. In order to estimate what proportion of the patients seeking care for influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection (ARI) actually has influenza, sites are encouraged to collect nasal samples from symptomatic patients. The samples are sent to the PHAS for initial PCR analysis of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and samples with positive findings from PCR analysis are further analysed and the viral strains are characterized by sequencing. The PHAS carries out laboratory analyses free of charge for these samples. Patient characteristics, including age, sex, risk factors, syndrome (ILI vs. ARI), and vaccination status, are included in the analysis of the virological findings. Data collected from the sentinel program in Sweden contributes to vaccine effectiveness studies for influenza and COVID-19 at the European level coordinated by the VEBIS network (Vaccine Effectiveness, Burden and Impact Studies). In the interim report for 2022–2023 in Europe, the vaccine effectiveness for all ages was estimated at or above 50 percent for influenza B and 27–44 percent for influenza A (6). During the 2022–2023 season, 322 sentinel samples were submitted from 55 GP sites. In total, 77 samples (24 percent) tested positive for influenza. Figure 21 shows the distribution of samples taken and the positive samples by subtype/lineage. The first positive sentinel sample was taken in week 41, and the highest number of positive cases was seen in week 51. During the second epidemic wave in the spring (weeks 6–12), some positive cases were detected in sentinel surveillance. This pattern was seen in other surveillance systems. The sentinel monitoring of influenza for the season ended in week 20. Of the subtyped or lineage-typed influenza-positive samples, 36 (47 percent) belonged to influenza A(H3), 25 (33 percent) belonged to A(H1)pdm09, and 16 (21 percent) belonged to B/Victoria. No cases of influenza B/Yamagata were found within the sentinel samples or laboratory-confirmed cases. Of the positive samples, three were co-infections of influenza A(H3) and SARS-CoV-2. The activity of sentinel sampling sites during the 2022–2023 season was limited, and thus fewer data from sentinel sampling were collected compared to the pre-pandemic period. This could be due to changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour together with challenges and time constraints experienced by healthcare personnel in primary care. As part of the contining work on integrated influenza and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, the goal is to strengthen the network to ensure the continuity and geographical representativeness of sentinel sites. Figure 21. The weekly number of sentinel samples submitted and positive samples by subtype/lineage, 2022–2023. Clinical features Of the 322 patients sampled through the sentinel system with known symptoms, 81 percent had ILI and 17 percent had ARI. In total, 60 percent of the samples came from women. Thirty-six percent of the samples were collected from patients belonging to a risk group due to age and/or medical condition (n = 96). Of these, 67 percent were aged 65 years or older (n = 75). The most common reported medical risk factors were chronic lung disease (n = 24), chronic heart disease (n = 18), diabetes (n = 15), immunosuppression (n = 6), and pregnancy (n = 5). The tables below summarise the laboratory results from the sentinel sampling system for the last three epidemic seasons, including the number of samples (Table 12), median age, ILI percentage, and sub/lineage type (Table 13). Season 2020–2021 is excluded due to very low levels of influenza. Table 12.

Influenza infection among vaccinated patients Vaccination status was reported for 289 (90 percent) of the 322 patients sampled during the season. Of these, 60 (19 percent) were vaccinated. Among the patients belonging to a risk group (96), 46 percent were vaccinated. Influenza was detected among nine vaccinated patients, of which eight were positive for influenza A and one was positive for B/Victoria. Subtyping showed five cases of influenza A(H3) and three cases of influenza A(H1)pdm09. Virus characterisation Subtyping and lineage determination All diagnostic laboratories perform influenza typing using molecular assays for influenza A and B, and some perform subtyping of influenza A. The PHAS performs subtyping and lineage typing by real-time PCR for all samples sent in from the diagnostic laboratories and on all positive samples from sentinel surveillance. In total, 1,710 influenza A-positive samples from laboratories in Sweden were subtyped during the season, of which 914 (53 percent) were A(H1)pdm09 and 796 (47 percent) were A(H3). As shown in Figure 22, the subtyped cases of both types of influenza A displayed a very similar pattern. The lineage was determined for 471 influenza B-positive samples, and all belonged to the B/Victoria lineage and none to the B/Yamagata lineage. The subtype and lineage of influenza-positive samples from sentinel and laboratory reporting systems are presented in Table 14. In the sentinel sampling system, a higher proportion of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 than influenza A(H3N2) was detected, as is usual during mixed seasons such as 2022–2023. In the sentinel system, patients are sampled by their GPs and generally have milder disease. Table 14.

Please note that the figure does not include unsubtyped influenza A cases, which made up the majority of influenza A cases during the season. Genotypic and phenotypic characterisation A selection of the influenza-positive samples from laboratories and from the sentinel surveillance programme are genetically characterised through whole genome sequencing (NGS on an Ion Torrent platform), and viruses isolated on cell culture undergo phenotypic sensitivity to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors using a MUNANA-based NA inhibition assay. Samples are selected to be as representative as possible in terms of geographical location, period of collection, and type/subtype/lineage type. The Swedish laboratories are also asked to send influenza-positive samples to the PHAS from severely ill or deceased patients, patients with vaccine break-through infections, and patients who do not respond to antiviral treatment. These samples all undergo further characterisation if the viral load is high enough. Genetic characterisation and virus isolation is usually successful for samples with a real-time PCR Ct-value ≤30 or below. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene is further analysed and affiliated to genetic groups in accordance with ECDC influenza characterisation guidelines. In addition, the parts of the HA gene that are the target for the subtype/lineage-specific real-time PCR systems used at the PHAS are analysed for sequence mismatches compared to primers and probes used in these systems. The NA gene is analysed with respect to amino acid substitutions previously shown to be associated with reduced or highly reduced inhibition by the NA inhibitors oseltamivir (Tamiflu®/Ebilfumin®), and zanamivir (Relenza®). The PA gene is analysed with respect to amino acid substitutions previously shown to be associated with a >3-fold increase in IC50-value for baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®). The matrix gene of influenza A viruses is analysed with respect to amino acid substitutions previously shown to result in resistance to amantadine. The parts of the matrix gene sequences of influenza A and B that are targets in the real-time PCR systems that are used for detection of influenza at the PHAS are analysed for mismatches to the PCR primers and probes. Phenotypic analysis of susceptibility to the NA inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir is performed with the neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) assay on a selection of the cell-propagated virus with the aim to cover all NA-sequence variants. A representative selection of the isolated virus samples is sent to the WHOCC in London for antigenic characterisation and for phenotypic analysis of susceptibility to NA inhibitors with the NAI assay. Characterisation data are continuously reported to the ECDC via TESSy, and sequence data are continuously uploaded to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Genetic groups The genetic groups of the 285 characterised Swedish influenza A and B viruses from the 2022–2023 season are shown in Tables 15A through C by influenza subtype or lineage and in the phylogenetic trees in Appendices 1–3. Of the characterised viruses, 89 were subtype A(H3N2), 101 were subtype A(H1N1)pdm09, and 95 were lineage type B/Victoria. Table 15A.

The dominant (73 percent) genetic group among viruses reported within the European surveillance until week 20, 2023 (8). No antigenic analyses are performed at the PHAS. The general antigenic properties of the genetic groups have, however, been summarised in the report by the WHO in conjunction with the influenza vaccine composition recommendation meeting for the northern hemisphere 2023–2024 held in February 2023 (9, 10). The antigenic analyses with ferret antisera raised against the respective vaccine viruses included in the northern hemisphere vaccine for 2022–2023 are described in the following sections (9, 10). Influenza A(H3N2) Circulating viruses since Sept. 2022 belong to group 1: 3C.2a1b.2a.1 and group 2: 3C.2a1b.2a.2, the latter showing co-circulation of multiple subgroups (2a.2a, 2a.2b, 2a.2c and 2a.2d).Antisera raised against viruses similar to the vaccine virus A/Darwin/6/2021 or A/Darwin/9/2021 (genetic group 3C.2a1b.2a.2a) reacted well with viruses in the genetic subgroup2a.2a, while viruses in subgroup 2a.2b were recognized less well. The majority (71 percent) of the Swedish viruses belong to subgroup 3C.2a1b.2a.2a, and 29 percent to subgroup 2a.2b, see the phylogenetic tree for influenza A(H3N2). Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Viruses circulating since September 2022 belong to group 6B.1A.5a.1 or 6B.1A.5a.2, with 6B.1A.5a.2 being the dominant group. This group has further evolved into subgroup 5a.2a and 5a.2a.1. Ferret antisera raised against the cell culture-propagated vaccine virus A/Victoria/2570/2019 or the egg-propagated vaccine virus A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (both genetic group 6B.1A.5a.2) reacted well against viruses in genetic group 6B.1A.5a.2 but poorly against the 6B.1A.5a.1 viruses. Human serum panels from vaccinated individuals showed that reactivity was reduced against recent A(H1N1)pdm09 of subgroup 5a.2a, 5a.2a.1, and 5a.1. Recommended vaccine viruses for the northern hemisphere 2023-2024 belong to subgroup 5a.2a.1. All Swedish viruses analysed belong to subgroups 5a.2a and 5a.2a.1. Influenza B/Victoria Circulating B/Victoria lineage viruses belong to group V1A.3. The majority of viruses in this group are designated subgroup V1A.3a, which has diversified into subgroup V1A.3a.1 and V1A.3a.2. Subgroup V1A.3a.2 is dominant in most of the geographic regions. Viruses in subgroup V1A.3a.2 were recognized well by antisera raised against the vaccine virus B/Austria/1359417/2021 (subgroup V1A.3a.2), and these results have been confirmed by human serology studies. Viruses in group V1A.3 were recognized less well. All analysed Swedish viruses belong to subgroup V1A.3a.2. Antiviral susceptibility The NA gene of 90 influenza A(H3N2), 102 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 94 influenza B/Victoria viruses were sequenced and analysed for amino acid substitutions previously shown to be associated with reduced or highly reduced inhibition by the NA inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. Of these, 285 viruses showed sensitivity to oseltamivir and zanamivir. In one A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, amino acid substitution N295S was detected as a minority variant. N295S is an amino acid substitution associated with reduced (AARI) or highly reduced (AAHRI) inhibition by oseltamivir. Additional phenotypic results are pending from both the PHAS and the WHOCC. The PA gene of 87 A(H3N2), 100 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 90 B/Victoria viruses was sequenced, and none of the amino acid substitutions previously shown to be associated with a >3-fold increase in IC50-value to baloxavir were detected. The amino acid substitution S31N in the matrix protein, which confers resistance to amantadine, was present in all 199 Swedish influenza A viruses (94 A(H3) and 105 A(H1)pdm09). Additional amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to amantadine were observed in 10 influenza A(H1)pdm09 viruses. Seven carried amino acid substitution L26F, and three carried substitution V27A. Virus isolation on cell culture Influenza-positive samples for virus isolation on MDCK-SIAT1 cells were selected from samples collected through the sentinel sampling and from samples sent to the PHAS from the Swedish laboratories. Samples are selected for virus isolation based on genetic properties of the virus as determined by sequence analysis, geographical location, period of collection, and type/subtype/lineage type. In addition, samples of special interest are selected for virus isolation, for example, samples from severely ill or deceased patients, patients with vaccine break-through infections, and patients who do not respond to antiviral treatment. Samples with a Ct-value >30, as well as samples known to have been inactivated in the laboratory, are not selected for isolation. A total of 54 viruses (19 A(H3N2), 19 A(H1N1)pdm09, and 26 B/Victoria) were successfully isolated on MDCK-SIAT1 cells. Of these, 54 virus isolates along with 44 matching clinical samples were sent to the WHOCC London for further characterisation in January 2022 and July 2023. Recommended vaccine composition In February 2023, the WHO recommended that the quadrivalent vaccines for use in the northern hemisphere in the 2023–2024 season contain the following viruses (9). Egg-based vaccines The WHO recommends that the following viruses be included in egg-based vaccines: A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)-like virus B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus Cell-based or recombinant-based vaccines The WHO recommends that the following viruses be included in cell-based or recombinant-based vaccines: A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus For quadrivalent egg- or cell culture-based or recombinant vaccines, WHO recommends the inclusion of a B/Yamagata lineage component: B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus. Vaccination coverage There is no national register for influenza vaccinations in Sweden, but an estimate of the vaccination coverage among persons 65 years of age and older is made by each of Sweden’s 21 county medical officers for their respective regions (also known as county councils). Various methods for estimation have been used in different regions, see Comments on vaccination data. Coverage among persons 65 years of age and older The national vaccination rate among persons aged 65 and older was approximately 63 percent in 2022–2023, which was higher than the seasons before the pandemic but lower than the 2021–2022 season (see Figure 23). It is estimated that approximately 1.3 million people aged 65 and older were vaccinated this season. As in previous seasons, coverage was highest among people aged 85 and older (71 percent), followed by those aged 75–84 years (69 percent, see Table 16). Figure 23. Vaccination coverage among persons aged 65 and older in Sweden, 2010–2011 to 2022–2023. Vaccinations began at the end of October at long-term care facilities, where adjuvanted influenza vaccines were used. The public vaccination campaign started on November 9, 2022 (week 45), during which quadrivalent standard-dose vaccines were used. As in the previous season, concomitant administration of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines was possible. Regional differences in vaccination coverage Comparisons among regions are difficult because estimates are based on different methods and there is uncertainty associated with each value. This season, nearly all regions had a lower vaccination coverage for the age group 65 years and older than the 2021–2022 season, but in most regions it was higher than the seasons before the COVID pandemic. Värmland was the only region to reach the WHO’s goal of 75 percent coverage. Västmanland increased coverage between the 2021–2022 and 2022–2023 seasons from 65 to 70 percent. Västerbotten also reached 70 percent coverage. Figure 24 shows the vaccination rates for the age group 65 years and older per region over the past two seasons. For more regional data and collection methods, see the Swedish-language weekly report for weeks 19 and 20 of the 2022–2023 season (11). Figure 24. Estimated proportion of vaccinated persons aged 65 and older per region in Sweden for seasons 2021–2022 and 2022–2023. Vaccination coverage among persons under 65 years It is difficult to estimate vaccination coverage among the medical risk groups under 65 years of age because these groups are hard to define and because data on risk group status is not usually collected. Sixteen regions (see Comments on vaccination data) have reported the number of persons vaccinated under 65 years of age, which gives an indication of the coverage. Coverage per age group for 2021–2022 and 2022–2023 from the twelve regions that reported both seasons are shown in Table 16. When all 16 reporting regions are included in coverage estimates for 2022–2023, coverage is slightly different for the following age groups: 18–39 years (2.3 percent), 40–64 years (7.0 percent), 65–74 years (53 percent) and 85 years and older (73 percent). Table 16. Percentage vaccinated per age group, 2021–2022 and 2022–2023.

Comments on vaccination data Data on vaccination coverage among persons 65 years of age and older have been collected by Sweden’s 21 county medical officers for their respective regions since 2003 and at the PHAS since 2014. Various methods for estimation have been used in different regions, including the use of vaccination registries, the number of vaccine doses given or distributed, sentinel reports on vaccination coverage, surveys among general practitioners, and patient record data. These methodological differences result in coverage estimates of varying quality and precision. Although the methods vary between regions, the methods within most regions have been roughly the same for the past several years, thus allowing a comparison over time. An estimate of the vaccination coverage in age groups younger than 65 is included, using data from a subset of regions where registry data by age group are available throughout the season as well as annually. These data come from Dalarna, Gotland, Gävleborg, Halland, Jämtland Härjedalen, Jönköping, Kalmar, Kronoberg, Norrbotten, Skåne, Stockholm, Sörmland, Värmland, Västernorrland, Västmanland, and Östergötland. Data from Gotland, Dalarna, Halland and Skåne are excluded from Table 16 for increased comparability between seasons. Vaccination coverage estimates were calculated using the population data from December 31 of each year (Source: Statistics Sweden), except for Dalarna where listed patients per age group were used instead. Changes in data sources and data excluded per region are noted in the Swedish language report published in June (11). For some regions, data sources do not include all doses given, e.g. doses given within municipal elderly care, at hospitals, or by private vaccination units. Syndromic surveillance Three systems of syndromic surveillance were used during the 2022–2023 influenza season – Webbsök (Web search), telephone calls to the national medical advice line 1177, and the web panel Hälsorapport (Health report). Webbsök is an automated system established in 2008 that uses a statistical model and anonymous search data from a medical advice website to estimate ILI incidence in primary care. Data are received daily and analysed weekly. The results are published on the web every Monday during the influenza season in the form of a graph (12), which is three days ahead of the publication of the weekly influenza bulletin. In collaboration with the national medical advice line 1177, the PHAS receives aggregated weekly data on calls from a system called Hälsoläge. The age group and main reason for calling are registered for all callers. The reported data include the number of calls related to cough, fever, and sore throat. The proportion of calls related to fever in children has previously been found to be a good indicator of influenza activity in the community. Data from this source was unavailable to the PHAS during February–June 2023 due to technical migration of the system. The system Hälsorapport (“Health report”) is a web-based reporting panel that helps the PHAS to get a picture of the Swedish population’s health and its views on health. It builds on the experience and knowledge gained from previous community-based surveillance systems used in Sweden as well as the Influenzanet network. Approximately 8,200 people aged 1 to 95 years participate in Hälsorapport are invited to respond to a health-related survey a few times a year. Between week 35, 2022, and week 24, 2023, participants received weekly surveys with questions on their health status for the preceding week. If the participants reported that they had fallen ill, they were asked to report their symptoms. Based on these reports, the PHAS was able to estimate the weekly cumulative notification rate of ARI and ILI in Sweden. In addition, participants were asked about certain measures of disease severity, such as healthcare-seeking behaviour and work or school absenteeism. Web search data (Webbsök) According to Webbsök, the 2022–2023 influenza season lasted for 7 weeks, from week 47, 2022, to week 1, 2023 (Figure 25), disregarding a false signal in week 45 during the start of the vaccination campaign. The influenza activity was at low or very low levels throughout most of the season and reached medium intensity in weeks 51 and 52. This peak coincided with the first peak for the laboratory-based surveillance (Figure 26). Between week 27, 2022, and week 26, 2023, a total of 291,966 queries related to influenza were entered, which was 4 percent of the total number of queries on the website 1177.se. Figure 25. Webbsök’s estimated proportion of the population with ILI per week, 2022–2023. Note that the increased levels during weeks 41–45 (grey period) for some seasons are deemed to be due to searches related to influenza vaccination rather than increased influenza activity. The statistical model is sometimes affected by intensive media coverage and other factors that change how people search for information on 1177.se. Results from Webbsök should therefore be interpreted with some caution and should be seen as a complement to the PHAS’s traditional monitoring methods (e.g., laboratory-based and sentinel surveillance).Figure 26. Webbsök’s estimated proportion of persons with ILI (incidence per 100,000 population) and the number of laboratory-confirmed cases, 2022–2023. Telephone advice line data (Hälsoläge) The percentage of calls to 1177 regarding fever in children (all ages) exceeded the epidemic threshold in week 42, 2022, and indicated a very high level of activity in weeks 50–52, 2022, using levels calculated based on data from pre-pandemic seasons. The percentage of calls about fever among children reached the highest level in week 51 at 14 percent, which was higher than the previous five seasons, see Figure 27 (two previous seasons shown). This metric for children aged 0–4 years also reached very high levels during the season (weeks 49–52, 2022), with 41 percent of calls in week 51. Fever among children is a non-specific indicator and can be due to causes other than influenza, not least COVID-19, which saw a peak in cases during this time. A noticeable peak in calls is often seen around the Christmas holidays every year, followed by a drop. The reason for this pattern might be decreased access to face-to-face healthcare services during the holidays leading to an increase in telephone consultations.Data from the system was not available from February to June 2023 because of technical migration of the system. Intensity levels have not yet been calculated for the updated system in use from June 2023. Figure 27. Percentage of telephone calls regarding fever in children received by the medical advice line 1177 for the past three seasons. Weekly symptoms reporting (Hälsorapport) Data from Hälsorapport show the highest levels of ILI during weeks 49 to 51, 2022, with around 3.5 percent of Sweden's population estimated to have fallen ill with ILI each week. During this time, COVID-19 cases reached the highest levels for the winter and influenza circulation was increasing. Laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza peaked in week 52, when around 2.4 percent of Sweden's population was estimated to have ILI, see Figure 29. The highest levels of ARI were also reported weeks 49 to 51, when 10.5–12.5 percent of the population was estimated to have fallen ill with ARI each week. In addition to the influenza epidemic, this period corresponds to high transmission of RSV and COVID-19. Figure 29.

Quality assessment External quality assessment programmes provide a comparison of method performance between laboratories and are a tool to ensure accurate laboratory testing. The PHAS takes part in several external programmes and produces a panel for other Swedish laboratories. Surveillance is dependent on such standardised methods. At the PHAS, one-step real-time RT-PCR assays are used detect influenza A and B, to subtype influenza A-positive samples, and to discriminate between the two influenza B lineages. These assays have also been optimized, implemented, and evaluated for avian influenza diagnostics. This is essential because these assays are sensitive, rapid, and can be scaled up if necessary. The PHAS continuously monitors the genomic sequences of circulating influenza strains in order to detect mutations that could affect the sensitivity of the PCR assays. The PHAS also performs in silico (computational) validation of each assay twice a year, both before and during the peak of the influenza season. Every year the PHAS produces a PCR panel for Swedish laboratories on behalf of the External Quality Assessment for Clinical Laboratory Investigations (EQUALIS). This allows laboratories to measure the analytical sensitivity and specificity of their methods. The majority of the laboratories performing diagnostics for influenza use commercial PCR kits. A number of these laboratories participate in additional quality controls during the season in order to ensure that circulating influenza strains are detected with these kits. National quality assessment programme for influenza PCR In September 2022, the PHAS produced a new PCR panel for Swedish laboratories, which was distributed by EQUALIS. Twenty-six laboratories participated in the panel that included ten samples in total: seven influenza A and three influenza B (the cycle threshold value range was 21–34 when analysed with the in house PCR method at the PHAS), and all of them reported 10/10 correct results. Control of commercial PCR kits Commercial PCR kits for influenza detection are widely used for diagnostic purposes. Each fall, ahead of the influenza season, a survey is conducted to determine which PCR kits are being used by Swedish clinical microbiology laboratories. The survey also presents the option to participate in a panel in order to ensure that the PCR kits that are used are able to detect the currently circulating influenza strains.For the 2022–2023 season, 15 laboratories responded to the survey. All responding laboratories used commercial PCR kits (some in combination with in house methods). Six laboratories, using in total 12 different commercial PCR kits, were selected to receive the panel.The following kits were evaluated:Xpert® Xpress CoV-2/Flu/RSV plus (Cepheid)Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV (Cepheid)ALINITY m RESP-4-PLEX ASSAY (Abbott)BIOFIRE® FILMARRAY® Respiratory 2.1 plus Panel (BioMerieux)LightMix Modular Influenza A + Influenza B (Roche)BD MAX (BD) VIASURE Flu A, Flu B & RSV (Certest)VitaPCR™ (SARS-CoV-2)/Flu A/B & RSV* (Credo Diagnostics)NeuMoDx Flu A-B/RSV/SARS-CoV-2 Vantage Test (Qiagen)QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel (Qiagen)Amplidiag® RESP-4 (Mobidiag)GenomEra SARS-CoV-2, Flu A/B + RSV Assay Kit (Abacus Diagnostica)Panther fusion (Hologic)The panel consisted of ten samples, including four A(H1N1)pdm09, four A(H3N2), and two B/Victoria samples. The cycle threshold values, when analysed with the in house PCR-method at the PHAS, varied between 25 and 32. Earlier in the season, problems with influenza A PCR detection were reported from various parts of Europe, where different methods had issues detecting influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3). Two of the samples in the panel resembled these viruses, with genetic changes in the matrix gene of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3). These could not be detected by two of the commercial kits. For one of the kits, there is a version 2.0 that was not evaluated with this panel. The laboratory using the other kit subsequently carried out an internal investigation that confirmed the low sensitivity, and in combination with other factors this resulted in the decision to use an alternative kit for influenza detection.A summary of panel results was presented on the PHAS website in order to inform other laboratories about the results. In the event of methodological issues with clinical samples, Swedish clinical microbiology laboratories are welcome to contact the PHAS to compare their results or to obtain sequence data for further investigation. External quality assessment programmes The PHAS participated in two external quality assessment programmes during 2022, including the “Annual WHO External Quality Assessment Programme for influenza” from the WHO and the “QCMD 2022 Influenza virus A and B RNA external quality assessment programme” from the QCMD (Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics). The results are summarised below. Annual WHO External Quality Assessment Programme for influenza The PHAS participated in the annual WHO External Quality Assessment Panel for influenza (no. 21) during 2022. Molecular detection, typing, and sub/lineage-typing Ten samples analysed by real-time PCR were correctly typed (A, B, or negative). Six of these were influenza A, with subtypes A(H1)pdm09, A(H3), A(H5), and A(H7) detected. Two influenza A samples could not be subtyped with real-time PCR, but whole-genome sequencing suggested they were subtype A(H9), and this was confirmed in the final report. This procedure follows the routine protocol at the PHAS in cases where the influenza A subtype cannot be established but where virus titres are high enough for further investigation. Genotyping and phenotypic antiviral susceptibility determination Genotyping analysis of the NA gene was performed by NGS on an Ion Torrent platform, and the results were correct for all three samples (two A(H3N2) and one A(H1N1)pdm09) included in the programme. Phenotypic analysis was performed using a MUNANA-based NAI assay (fluorescence-based), and the results were correct for all three samples (same samples as above). QCMD 2022 Influenza virus A and B RNA external quality assessment programme Real-time PCR accurately detected the correct type, subtype, and lineage in all ten samples analysed. Subtyping and lineage typing identified influenza A(H1)pdm09, A(H3), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. References Public Health Agency of Sweden. Publikationer [Publications]. [Internet].

Investigation of severe complications of influenza B among adolescents During March 2023, five cases of influenza B associated with severe extra-respiratory complications were reported in Örebro region (population just over 300,000), located in south central Sweden. An epidemiological link was identified among three cases. The initial cases were among people under the age of 20 without underlying conditions who presented with severe myocarditis or encephalitis. Although myocarditis and encephalitis are known, but unusual, complications of influenza infection, the initial epidemiological cluster prompted activities at the regional level and a national investigation. Aim and activities The investigation aimed to identify any other cases of influenza B with severe complications (in all ages), as well as to assess whether the number of influenza B cases with severe complications was higher than expected and whether there was any common contributing cause beyond influenza infection or any possible viral factors associated with the observed severe complications. Activities within the investigation included: Regional case finding using the case definition below. The PHAS also requested labs to send samples for sequencing. Follow up of severe influenza B cases and analysis of COVID-19 vaccination status and previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Communication with epidemiological and virological colleagues and agencies within Europe.Review of national and regional data on previous seasons.Literature search on rates of influenza-associated complications of myocarditis or encephalitis among children and possible risk factors. Literature search on viral factors (genomic markers) associated with myocarditis or encephalitis. Communication through spokespersons and via weekly influenza reports.Virological investigation. Case definition The following case definitions were used to identify cases from the 2022–2023 season for inclusion in the investigation. A confirmed case was a patient with confirmed influenza B infection (a), regardless of age, who has sought care in Sweden with one of the following severe complications from Oct 1, 2022, onward:Myocarditis (b)Encephalitis/meningitis/meningoencephalitis (c)A suspected case was a patient with influenza-like illness, regardless of age, who has sought care in Sweden without a confirmed influenza diagnosis, but where another cause has not been found, and with one of the following severe complications, from Oct 1, 2022, onward: Myocarditis (b)Encephalitis/meningitis/meningoencephalitis (c)(a) ICD-10 codes: J10, J11 or laboratory report in SmiNet. (b) ICD-10 codes: I40, I41. (c) ICD-10 codes: G04, G05, A85, A86, A87, A88, A89. Epidemiological results Identified cases The investigation identified further cases with serious complications in scattered regions within Sweden. Among these, a second small cluster was detected in a region geographically separate from the first (Jämtland Härjedalen). In total, 17 confirmed and three suspected cases in all ages were identified, notified from December to May, see Figure 30. Ten cases were female and ten were male, and age groups ranged from 0–10 years to 60–69 years, with a median age of 18 years. Ten cases had myocarditis, of which six were under 20 years of age, and ten cases had encephalitis, of which five were under 20 years of age. The majority of cases (n = 12) received intensive care, including several in ECMO (n = 4). Three cases died.Figure 30. The number of confirmed and suspected influenza cases with severe outcomes included in the investigation and the total number of influenza B cases per month of influenza sampling, 2022–2023. Influenza vaccination status Data on influenza vaccination status is missing for most investigated cases, but it is likely that most cases were not vaccinated because they did not belong to risk groups recommended vaccination. Influenza vaccination is not recorded in the National Vaccination registry, and availability of data on the regional level varies, see also Vaccination coverage. COVID-19 vaccination status Analysis of the COVID-19 vaccination status of cases under investigation showed no association or common factor among cases in terms of influenza infection and: vaccination status, type of COVID-19 vaccine, vaccine batch, dose number, or timing of COVID-19 vaccination in reference to onset of influenza. In total, 15 of 19 cases included in the analysis had been vaccinated with at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and all vaccinated cases were 12 years of age or older when they received their first vaccine dose. Most vaccinated cases had received two doses (n = 11), while a few had received one dose (n = 2) or three doses (n = 2). The latest date of vaccination was May 25, 2022. On the whole, these data reflect vaccine recommendations in Sweden. Previous COVID-19 infection Data on notified (laboratory-confirmed) cases of COVID-19 give some information on COVID-19 infection among the population. However, most mild cases of COVID-19 would not have been tested during the 2022–2023 season. Discussions with clinicians treating the cases gave no indication that any had recent COVID-19 infection, and a review of the data on mandatory laboratory reports of COVID-19 cases showed that none of the investigated influenza cases had a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in the months leading up to the influenza infection. Risk factors for severe complications Assessments of cases did not reveal any common risk factors or additional etiological factors associated with the development of myocarditis or encephalitis in children with influenza infection, see the Review of literature section. Virological results Virological analyses and sequencing of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene showed that all Swedish influenza B strains characterized during the 2022–2023 season, including samples from the severe investigated cases, belonged to the same genetic group of B/Victoria (V1A.3a.2). Sequence data did not support genetic clustering of the severe cases. Sequences from patients with severe complications were distributed over different branches of the HA tree and were similar to samples collected from other patients (not reported with severe complications), and similar patterns were observed for the other gene segments such as neuraminidase (NA) and non-structural protein (NS). The same genetic group (V1A.3a.2) dominated the circulation of influenza B in Europe during the season and was included in the season's influenza vaccines, see also the Virus characterization section. Further virological investigations at the PHAS include ongoing whole genome analysis of the influenza B/Victoria subtype, including the viruses detected in samples obtained from the severe cases, and will consider any reported genomic markers, as noted in the literature search section. Collaboration and communication Our investigation has not found similar clusters in other European countries during the 2022–2023 season and no reports of increased severity of influenza B were found globally. Timely communication was possible because communication channels between the regional, national, and international levels were already established and in use before the investigation began. Regional vaccination offer In Sweden, influenza vaccination is only recommended to children if they belong to a risk group for severe illness. Part of the regional response in Region Örebro was to offer vaccination of children 6–17 years free of charge (inactivated quadrivalent vaccine). The offer of vaccination was seen as important in terms of health equity for families in the affected community. Because influenza B was circulating widely at this point in the season, it was determined unlikely that any actions taken would have an effect on influenza transmission. Historical data on influenza B Sweden has seen transmission of influenza B, mainly B/Victoria, during four of the past eight seasons and only a small number of cases in remaining seasons. The latest intense influenza B season was 2017–2018, when B/Yamagata caused an intense epidemic affecting all ages. Infection with B/Yamagata provides limited immunity against B/Victoria. No seroepidemiological study has been conducted in Sweden in recent years, but Norway has a seroepidemiological program to follow population immunity against circulating influenza viruses (13). Although influenza circulation sometimes differs between the two neighbouring countries, this gives an indication of immunity levels in the Swedish population. Prevalence of antibodies against recent variants of B/Victoria in 2022 was 10 percent overall, lower among children 0–4 years (6 percent). A review of data on patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza B reported from intensive care units from 2015–2016 to 2022–2023 showed that a small number of patients under the age of 20 had been reported with cardiac or neurological complications during seasons with substantial influenza B circulation. Data on the 2022–2023 season show a higher number of patients under 20 years of age with influenza B in intensive care and a higher number of patients under 20 of age in intensive care with cardiac or neurological complications, compared with data going back to season 2015–2016, proportionate to the higher number of laboratory-confirmed cases seen this season, see Table 17. Table 17.

The results indicated that the numbers of myocarditis and encephalitis cases during the 2022–2023 season were no higher than other seasons. The proportion of myocarditis among influenza B cases was similar to the intense 2017–2018 B/Yamagata season. Overall, cases of myocarditis and encephalitis among laboratory-confirmed influenza cases under 18 years of age were rare, with data showing between zero and two cases of each complication per season in Stockholm. See also Region Stockholm’s report on the 2022–2023 influenza season (14). Review of the literature Risk factors associated with myocarditis or encephalitis in children with influenza infection A review of the scientific literature was performed with the aim to identify reported frequencies of occurrence of influenza associated myocarditis and encephalitis. The review included scientific articles indexed in PubMed and used search keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) terms related to ‘influenza’ and the ‘frequency’/’epidemiology’ of occurrence of its severe extra pulmonary complications ‘myocarditis’ and ‘encephalitis’. The search for overall frequencies of occurrence of myocarditis in influenza cases identified 141 abstracts, of which 9 were reviewed in full. For myocarditis in children a total of 56 abstracts were screened, with only 3 manuscripts reporting frequencies from cohort studies. For the occurrence of influenza-associated encephalitis, 4 studies discussing epidemiological data were reviewed (out of 175 abstracts, most being case reports). Most studies only include data regarding influenza A infections. Both myocarditis and encephalitis are known extra-pulmonary complications of influenza infections. The actual incidence of influenza-related myocarditis in the general population is unknown because of its variable clinical presentation (15, 16) and because of variable indications and methods of diagnosis and screening (17). A small number of cohort studies report frequencies between 0.5-5 percent of myocarditis in children hospitalized with influenza (18, 19, 20), primarily from data on the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 pandemic of 2009. Myocardial involvement in influenza cases is likely more common, with possibly around 10 percent or more of all influenza cases having some level of myocardial involvement (16, 21). It is therefore likely to be underdiagnosed. Fulminant myocarditis is believed to be uncommon, although post-mortem studies of influenza A infection suggest that it might also be underreported (16). Influenza-associated encephalitis may, according to a small number of scientific articles, occur in about 1–1.5 percent of children and up to 4 percent of adults hospitalized with influenza (18, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26). Few publications exist on rates of complications in children for influenza B or by influenza subtype and lineage, outside of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Known etiological factors for fulminant myocarditis include, besides viral infections, infections with other pathogens; genetic factors (e.g. genetically predisposed heart-disease); environmental, lifestyle, and behavioural factors, including medication and drug use and, possibly, nutritional factors; medical conditions including autoimmune disease; certain allergies; and age and gender. The precise interaction of different factors, including the possibility of myocarditis being caused by multiple aetiologies (i.e. influenza infection and another factor) remains to be described. Comorbidity and pre-existing diseases, especially neurodevelopmental disorders, are associated with an increased risk of influenza-associated neurological complications, although the absence of underlying diseases or other risk factors does not mean one cannot develop an influenza-associated central nervous system complication. Virological markers associated with myocarditis, encephalitis or myositis in influenza infection A review of the scientific literature was performed with the aim of identifying genomic markers in either influenza A or B viruses reported to be associated with the complications observed in severe cases. The review included scientific articles indexed in PubMed and published in the last ten years (2013–2023), and it used search keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) terms related to virulence, influenza, and the relevant complications, i.e., myocarditis, encephalitis, and myositis (the latter being at times reported among the severe cases). In total, 140 abstracts were screened leading to 50 full-text reviews.The HA segment was the most frequently described segment in the literature with regards to the complications, followed by the RNA polymerase genes (PA, PB1 and PB2), and the NA segment. Other segments were not common in the search results. Most genomic markers described in the literature were reported in avian-associated subtypes of influenza A (e.g., H3, H4, H5, H7, H9 and H10), followed by influenza A H1 subtypes. In contrast, only a small number of articles about influenza B were found.The results of the review revealed frequent reporting of genomic markers associated with neurological findings such as neurotropism, neurovirulence, encephalitis, and neuroinflammation, primarily in influenza A subtypes of avian origin (infecting human or avian hosts or in mice as an animal model), and to a lesser extent in H1 subtypes. Contrary to the observed number of neurological reports, myocarditis and other heart conditions were rarely found, and myositis was almost absent in influenza A studies. Other genetic markers were associated with non-specific pathogenicity, such as enhanced viral growth, enhanced viral binding, increased viral replication efficacy, higher disease severity, or higher mortality, but studies did not refer to the target complications specifically. These markers associated with non-specific pathogenicity were abundant in influenza A reports and to some degree also in influenza B. We found that influenza B reports either referred to non-specific pathogenicity or described the target complications but lacked follow-up analysis of the viral genome. Communication with virological experts globally confirmed that little is known about factors linked to virulence in influenza B. Conclusions Based on the epidemiological investigations, the number of influenza B cases with severe complications during the 2022–2023 season in Sweden was not higher than expected during a period of intense influenza transmission. Although severe cases are expected during influenza epidemics, the initial epidemiological cluster of severe cases remains unusual. Taking into account the generated evidence, the cluster cannot be explained beyond the overall high levels of influenza B/Victoria transmission among children during the 2022–2023 season. Similarly, the microbiological investigations did not identify viral factors that could be associated with severity. Low levels of immunity, particularly in children (13), against B/Victoria possibly increased transmission and the intensity of this season’s influenza B epidemic among children. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the circulation of other respiratory pathogens, including influenza, has been great and has, at least temporarily, changed the patterns and severity of influenza seasons.

O’Donnell of the Perelman School of Medicine answers common questions about this year’s flu shot and the new COVID-19 vaccines. Image: Bernard Chantal for Adobe Stock With flu season around the corner and the ongoing uptick in COVID-19 cases, many have questions about the vaccines for both viruses. Penn Today spoke with Judith A. O’Donnell, a physician and section chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center and a professor of infectious diseases at the Perelman School of Medicine, to learn about this year’s flu shot and the new COVID-19 vaccines. “Flu and COVID vaccines provide real-world, real-life benefits, and I strongly recommend that everybody considers getting them,” O’Donnell says. Who should get the annual flu shot, and when? Anybody 6 months and older should get the flu vaccine. It has benefits for everyone. In terms of timing, you never know exactly when flu season is going to start, but most typically flu season kicks off in December, peaks in January, and then kind of peters out through February, and it’s usually gone by March. The vaccine is going to give you good protection for about four to six months, so October is a good time to get your flu vaccine; it’s safely before the season starts, and, if for some reason flu season gets a late start and doesn’t peak until March, you’re still going to be protected. How effective is this year’s formulation expected to be? The flu vaccine changes year to year, and the components that are used in the flu vaccine are decided upon based on what’s circulating in the southern hemisphere before we move into our winter season here in the northern hemisphere. We won’t be able to definitively determine if it’s a good match, and therefore provides good protection, until we know what’s circulating here in the northern hemisphere. But the important thing to recognize is that, even if it’s not a great match, everybody gets some level of an immunity boost when they get the flu vaccine, and what is most important about the flu vaccine is that it prevents you from getting severely ill and it keeps you out of the hospital. I’ve taken care of many patients who were completely healthy and could be considered low risk for a serious flu infection but got flu, were very sick, required hospitalization, and in some cases were in the hospital for several weeks. The bottom line is that anybody can get flu and become severely ill, and the flu vaccine prevents severe illness. Is there anything different about this year’s flu shot recommendations? One thing that’s new this year is that if a patient reports a history of an egg allergy, they can still safely receive the vaccine, and they can be treated like anybody else in terms of getting the vaccine without any additional period of observation after vaccination to ensure no allergic side effects. The CDC recently approved two new COVID-19 vaccines, produced by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. How are these new vaccines different from last year’s booster shots? These are new updated vaccines, and the great news is that they are going to give you immunity to what is circulating right now in the community. The new vaccines are different from the bivalent booster vaccines that came out about a year ago in that these are now monovalent vaccines, meaning they only target one COVID subvariant. The bivalent vaccine used two strains of COVID—the original strain from 2020 and then an early Omicron strain—but at this point we know the only virus strains circulating are the Omicron subvariants, so there was no reason to keep that original virus strain in the updated vaccine formulation. Who should get the new COVID-19 vaccine? Everyone can benefit from this vaccine, and I would encourage everyone to strongly consider getting it. We are seeing a consistent uptick in COVID cases over the last six weeks, and we don’t expect that to reverse course anytime soon. Getting the vaccine now will really help prevent you from getting infected. I would highly recommend it in anybody who is 50 or older, anybody who has any chronic medical conditions, including being overweight, having asthma as well as more serious diseases like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease, and anybody who smokes. There are benefits for young, healthy people as well. I know from having conversations with patients that in that situation there’s some questioning—I’m young, I feel fine, I work out regularly, I’m a normal weight, and I don’t smoke—so what’s the benefit to me? My conversations with those patients are usually around who do you know, because you may want to get the vaccine so that you don’t get infected and pass it on to someone in your life like your new baby or your elderly grandparent or your sibling who’s just undergone a transplant. When should people get the new COVID-19 vaccine? If you haven’t had COVID in 2023, you should get the COVID vaccine now, or soon, even if you were boosted last fall or in the spring. If you had COVID in the summertime of this year, I would say to wait a little bit because that infection is going to give you a fair amount of immunity, so you really don’t need the boost from this new vaccine yet. An infection usually gives you a boost in immunity for around four to six months, so I suggest timing the new vaccine to be at least three or four months from your infection. However, if you are one of these people who is immunocompromised and don’t really know if you’re not making good antibodies to infections or vaccines, then you may want to get the vaccine soon, even if you were recently infected. You should discuss this with your health care provider. Another thing to layer into your decision about timing is, what are your plans for the late fall and early winter in terms of holiday gatherings or traveling? The vaccines give you the most immunity for around three months after you get them, and after that the antibodies wane a little bit, so some people may want to time their COVID booster for the end of October or early November so that they’re getting peak immunity in time for Thanksgiving and the winter holidays. But the people who have that luxury are the people who are otherwise fairly healthy. What sort of protection does the COVID booster offer? It doesn’t completely protect you from getting infected, and none of the earlier vaccines have done that, either, but it absolutely does prevent against severe disease. The data tell us that vaccination prevents patients from ending up in the hospital with COVID, requiring supplemental oxygen, requiring a ventilator, or having to go to an ICU setting and dying from COVID. Does vaccination help prevent long COVID? We don’t know a lot about these new vaccines and prevention of long COVID, but what the published studies have told us thus far is that vaccination, with or without having had infection, seems to somewhat prevent long COVID. There is still much that is unknown about long COVID, but what we have learned is that those who are vaccinated are at lower risk of developing it. Can you get the flu shot and the new COVID vaccine at the same time? Yes, you can do it, and, yes, I would recommend it. It’s a personal decision, but, if you’re like me and you want to get everything over at once, just roll up both sleeves, get one in each arm, and you’re good to go, and you don’t have to make two separate appointments.

Video Ad Feedback Early lab tests ease fears about new Covid variant 00:47 - Source: CNN CNN — Autumn is here, school is back in session, and along with the recent uptick in Covid-19 cases, people are experiencing sniffles, coughs and other cold-like symptoms. What should people do if they have these symptoms? At what point should they get tested for Covid-19, flu and other viruses? What can they take to feel better, and when should they seek medical help? And what precautions should they take at school, work and home? To help us with these questions, I spoke with our CNN wellness medical expert, Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner. FILE - COVID-19 antigen home tests indicating a positive result are photographed in New York, April 5, 2023. The Biden administration has announced that it is providing $600 million in funding to produce new at-home COVID-19 tests and is restarting a website allowing Americans to again order up to four free tests per household. (AP Photo/Patrick Sison, File) Patrick Sison/AP Free Covid-19 tests are now available for order from the US government CNN: What should people do if they develop cold-like symptoms? Dr. Leana Wen: Respiratory infections are very common, especially in winter. There are over 200 viruses that cause the common cold. It’s estimated that children go through six bouts of respiratory illnesses every year, while adults develop two to four episodes. Cold-like symptoms generally go away without specific treatment. What people should do if they have these symptoms depends on their medical conditions and the vulnerability of those in their household. There are some individuals who are very vulnerable to severe outcomes from viral diseases such as Covid-19 and influenza. Those individuals should take antiviral treatment if they test positive to reduce their risk of hospitalization and death. I’d urge anyone to take a home test for Covid-19 if they develop cold-like symptoms if they are 65 and over, 50 and over with underlying medical conditions, or are immunocompromised or have serious pre-existing illnesses affecting their heart and lungs. If it’s positive, they could take Paxlovid if eligible, and if not, they could ask their health care provider for the other oral antiviral treatment, molnupiravir, or the antiviral injection remdesivir. These individuals should also consider testing for influenza, especially if they develop fevers and body aches. If they have the flu, they should take the antiviral that targets influenza, Tamiflu. It’s also important for people who are living in the same household as someone who is vulnerable to test for Covid-19 early and often. The coronavirus is highly contagious, and if you are positive, you could take proactive steps to isolate from the high-risk people living with you. Children go through about six bouts of respiratory illnesses every year, while adults develop two to four episodes. Luis Alvarez/Digital Vision/Getty Images/FILE CNN: What about other viruses? At what point should people get tested for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), for example? Wen: Some doctors’ offices will routinely test for RSV as part of a viral panel. Since there is no targeted antiviral treatment for RSV, a positive test does not change management. Most people with cold-like symptoms do not need a viral panel for this reason. There are some circumstances where physicians may advise full viral testing—for instance if an immunocompromised patient is very ill. However, most people will not need to find out exactly what virus is causing their symptoms, since it won’t change what treatment they receive. Hand of maid washing tomato fresh vegetables preparation healthy food in kitchen Sarinyapinngam/iStockphoto/Getty Images Doctor shares advice on how to prevent food poisoning CNN: What precautions should people with cold-like symptoms take at school, work and home? Wen: Let’s take each of these situations separately. Schools generally have policies around such illnesses. Most do not allow kids to return to school if they have a fever or severe viral symptoms such as vomiting. Some require a doctor’s note, and there may also be requirements for testing. Workplaces may also have these protocols. When in doubt, stay home when you have a fever and active or new symptoms. If you must return to work, wear a well-fitting, high-quality mask when around others, including in conference rooms and while riding public transportation, to prevent infecting others. What precautions to take at home depends on the vulnerability of those living with you. If everyone is generally healthy, it’s not unreasonable to do what you did before Covid-19. Parents might decide that keeping away from sick children or keeping a symptomatic child away from an asymptomatic one, is not worth the extra effort. On the other hand, if someone in the household is very vulnerable—for instance, an elderly grandparent with severe lung disease—then that person should not be in the same room as the sick individual. CNN: What can people take to feel better? Wen: If someone has Covid-19 or influenza and is eligible for antivirals, they should take those early in the course of their illness. Otherwise, it’s symptomatic treatment. That means drinking lots of fluids to keep hydrated and getting plenty of rest. If someone develops a fever or muscle aches, they could take Tylenol or ibuprofen. Other over-the-counter medications can provide some relief for specific symptoms, too, such as nasal congestion and coughing. CNN: When should people seek medical help? Wen: Most people will not need to see their health care provider for cold-like viral illnesses. Those who should be more concerned are those who are elderly or are very young, and people with high-risk conditions. These people and their caregivers should be ready to seek medical help if they are concerned or if something does not seem right—for instance, if an elderly person seems confused, a baby is more fussy or drowsy than usual, or someone who has an underlying condition that seems to be getting worse. Otherwise, reasons to seek medical help include not being able to keep down fluids — and in little children, decrease in wet diapers — shortness of breath and difficulty breathing and persistent fever for more than a few days. Intense and worsening symptoms such as sore throat and headache could prompt a call to the doctor as well. Finally, people who vulnerable to severe illness due to Covid-19 and their household members should test for the coronavirus. Those vulnerable should have a plan in advance about accessing antiviral treatment to both Covid-19 and influenza.

Mark J. Terrill/AP The latest Covid-19 vaccine is here. Here’s where and when to get it — and RSV and flu shots, too CNN: Finally, can you remind us of how people protect themselves from picking up these viruses? Wen: I want to underscore that viral infections are extremely common and difficult to avoid. However, there are steps people can take to reduce their chance of infection. These steps include careful handwashing. Viruses can be transmitted through high-touch surfaces. People who are out and about should wash their hands or use hand sanitizer before touching their face or eating. Depending on how important it is to avoid viral infections, individuals can take additional steps, including avoiding indoor crowded spaces and wearing a high-quality mask around others. Of course, I would urge people to be up-to-date on their vaccines, including the new Covid-19 vaccine, the flu shot and, if eligible, the new RSV vaccines.

From: UK Health Security Agency Published 26 September 2023 The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has agreed a deal for millions of life-saving vaccines to be produced in the UK if a future influenza pandemic is ever declared. The advance purchase agreement (APA) means healthcare company CSL Seqirus will be on standby to produce over 100 million influenza pandemic vaccines if or when they are needed. UKHSA and its predecessor organisations have had similar agreements in the past, but this is the first time the manufacturing process will be based entirely in the UK, giving better security of access if global demand ever outweighs supply. The vaccines will be tested, licensed, and approved and tailored to combat the specific pandemic flu strain identified at the time. They will be produced at CSL Seqirus’s existing manufacturing plant in Liverpool in the event a pandemic is declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). Professor Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of UKHSA, said: We have seen from past pandemic events, including COVID-19, that access to effective vaccines is vital to help save lives and minimise disruption to our lives and livelihoods. This agreement represents a major step forward in our preparedness against future influenza pandemics. Manufacturing these potentially life-saving vaccines inside the UK gives us speedier and more secure access, enabling us to roll them out to those who need them more quickly. Vaccines Minister, Maria Caulfield said: This deal with CSL Seqirus places us on the front foot if we are faced with an influenza pandemic in the future. It will ensure vaccines are manufactured in the UK – enabling us to get jabs into arms fast regardless of global demand and save thousands of lives. Marc Lacey, Global Executive Director at CSL Seqirus, said: CSL Seqirus is a global leader in pandemic influenza preparedness, and we’re pleased the UK government will continue to partner with us in preparing to provide protection against the potential of a flu pandemic. This agreement will help to ensure the UK maintains robust preparedness and rapid response capabilities for this potential future threat. Pandemic influenza is not the same as seasonal influenza or avian influenza. Seasonal influenza circulates every year and causes thousands of deaths, though it generally causes milder illness among healthy adults because of existing immunity. Avian influenza, meanwhile, cannot be passed from human to human. A new influenza strain that was detected globally and was transmitting from person to person, against which we would have no immunity, could be categorised by WHO as the cause of a global influenza pandemic. Although influenza pandemics are highly unpredictable in terms of their timing, duration and severity, historic events show that they can occur at any time. There have been 4 influenza pandemics over the past 100 years, arising in 1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009. The 1918 pandemic was responsible for over 50 million deaths worldwide, and pandemic influenza continues to be a major health security concern.

Killer T cells (also known as CD8+ T cells) play a critical role in the immune system by eliminating virus-infected cells. While much has been studied about these immune cells in adults, little was known about how they evolve and function across the human lifespan – until now. In a pioneering research published in Nature Immunology and led by the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Doherty Institute) and UNSW Sydney, researchers employed cutting-edge technologies to examine killer T cells in different age groups – newborns, school-aged children, adults and older adults (60+ years) – to understand how age shapes our immunity to influenza viruses. University of Melbourne’s Dr Carolien van de Sandt, a Senior Research Fellow at the Doherty Institute and first author of the paper, said the team uncovered unexpected similarities in T cell responses between newborns/children and older adults. “Based on previous studies, we expected to find that killer T cells in older adults were less effective because they had become exhausted or ‘fallen asleep’," said Dr van de Sandt. “However, to our surprise, the very efficient killer T cells that we detected in children and adults seemed to actually disappear and be replaced with suboptimal cells in older adults. It is almost as if you replace the sword of a Roman soldier with a kitchen knife; they can learn how to use it, but it will never be as efficient as the sword. “One of the most intriguing findings of the study was that these cells, with a lower ability to recognise influenza viruses, displayed gene features closely similar to T cells found in newborns.” University of Melbourne’s Professor Katherine Kedzierska, Head of the Human T cell Laboratory at the Doherty Institute and senior author on the paper, said this research greatly contributes to our understanding of how immunity changes over an individual’s lifespan, and has the potential to significantly advance the field of vaccinology. “Our findings suggest that if we want to boost killer T cells through vaccination, the timing may play an essential role to maintain these optimal killer T cells into old age,” said Professor Kedzierska. “This study is a turning point for the research into ageing immunity. It has far-reaching implications and opens up new possibilities for the development of better vaccines and therapies tailored to different age groups.” This work was conducted in collaboration with Associate Professor Fabio Luciani, co-senior author from UNSW Sydney. Associate Professor Luciani said the study provides valuable insights into the complexity of killer T cell responses as we age. "Importantly, we utilised new machine learning methods to reconstruct how these influenza virus-specific killer T cells develop over the lifespan. As individuals grow, killer T cells get stronger and more effective at eliminating infected cells, but they disappear in older adults, where they are taken over by cells with a lower killing capacity," he said.

The T cell inside the younger silhouette is brighter, while the T cell in the older figure is faded in the background, symbolizing its lack of response and efficiency. The overlapping of the two CD8+ T cells creates a visual juxtaposition between the two T cells and their receptors.

Photo: Dickson LeeHong Kong has recorded its first child fatality from influenza this year after a previously healthy five-year-old girl who caught the flu developed complications and died.The girl, who had not received a flu jab, fell ill with a fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath and was taken to St Teresa’s Hospital in Mong Kok for treatment on Monday last week.Her condition worsened the following day and she was transferred to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Yau Ma Tei and admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit.Coronavirus: more than half of Hongkongers willing to stick with preventive Covid measures, but most reluctant to get booster shotsLaboratory tests on the girl’s respiratory specimen came back positive for influenza A (H3). A clinical diagnosis also indicated she had contracted the virus, which was complicated by encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. She died last Thursday.Four paediatric flu cases involving severe complications – all caused by the H3 strain – were reported between Sunday and Wednesday. Two patients, aged five and 16, had been inoculated.Meanwhile, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau, other government officials and Hospital Authority officials received seasonal flu jabs at Sai Wan Ho general outpatient clinic on Thursday.Lo warned that the city was approaching the winter season with the Covid-19 mask mandate no longer in force, which presented residents with greater challenges. He stressed the importance of early vaccination.Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau receives a flu jab on Thursday. Photo: Yik Yeung-man“It is important to note that influenza and Covid-19 infections can occur simultaneously. If someone contracts both, the situation can be quite severe,” he said.“While taking measures to prevent influenza, it is also crucial to prevent Covid-19 infection. “This is why we started administering seasonal influenza vaccines earlier this year.”The Department of Health administered more than 1.56 million doses of the flu vaccine in 2022, a 25 per cent increase over the previous year.The department said there had been notable progress especially among the elderly, with the flu jab coverage rate for those aged 65 and above rising by 8 per cent. That indicated almost half of the city’s elderly population had been vaccinated.Allergies, a cold or coronavirus? How to tell the differenceIn care homes for the elderly, the vaccination coverage rate for both residents and staff was 70 per cent.“However, we have some concerns regarding children, as the coverage rate for influenza vaccination among those aged 12 or below has slightly decreased by 5 per cent,” Director of Health Ronald Lam Man-kin said.“Our latest calculations indicate that about 50 per cent of them have been vaccinated.”This year’s Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Subsidy Scheme started on Thursday.The Government Vaccination Programme, Seasonal Influenza Vaccination School Outreach Programme and the Residential Care Home Vaccination Programme begin next Thursday.Sign up for the YP Teachers NewsletterGet updates for teachers sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicyCommentSign up for YP WeeklyGet updates sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicySign up for YP WeeklyGet updates sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy Policydiscovernewslifestyleentertainmentadviceyour voicevideoscmp.comLearnreportTEAM YPjournalism resourceslatest reportslearnlearning resourcescollege & uni lifecareer adviceeventssparkStoriesWorksheetstrending topicsHKDSE - Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary EducationHealth and fitnessEnvironmentalLivingRelationshipsStudent lifeCareersEnglish exercisesVideo gamesK-popMental healthCelebritiesMedia literacye-paperYP is a unit of South China Morning Post.SCMPVisit scmp.comAbout UsContact UsWrite for UsPrivacy PolicyTerms & Conditions© 2024 South China Morning Post Publisher Ltd.

Although the influenza vaccine and the updated COVID-19 shot are not currently available, experts anticipate their rollout in mid-October, with the timing depending on the province or territory.While these vaccines are on the horizon, experts understand that many Canadians may still be cautious about receiving both shots. 2:29 Canada at the ‘beginning’ of its fall respiratory season: Tam “I think people are tired of vaccines in general — of the COVID vaccine for sure. But in mid-October, when we launch the public health campaigns for vaccination, we want people to think about getting their COVID shot and their flu shot at the same time,” said Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre. Story continues below advertisement “If we let our guard down and we have too low an uptake of vaccination for COVID and flu, that will lead to increased transmission and will potentially stress the health care system more significantly than it can bear,” he added. What happens when you get the flu and COVID shot at once? The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) said anyone above six months of age can get an influenza vaccine and a COVID-19 shot at the same appointments.The decision to administer both vaccines at once is “patient-based,” explained Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious disease physician and associate professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont.But he assured Canadians that getting the vaccines at the same time is perfectly safe and effective.“Absolutely, you can get them together,” he said. “We have data about co-administration of flu and COVID vaccine suggesting there’s fairly significant safety and there’s no compromise in the efficacy of the vaccines.” Story continues below advertisement 4:17 Concerns remain over spread of new COVID-19 variant Chagla noted that one potential side effect of receiving both vaccines together is temporary soreness in the arms, which typically lasts for a day or two.

A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) study published in July 2022 did not find any safety concerns with getting both vaccines at once.However, the report did find that people who got a flu vaccine and an mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccine at the same time were slightly more likely (eight to 11 per cent) to have reactions including fatigue, headache, and muscle ache than people who only got a COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine, but these reactions were mostly mild and went away quickly.There are other benefits to getting both shots at once, Chagla said, especially for people who may not have the opportunity to book two visits. Story continues below advertisement “I think it also presents an opportunity for individuals and providers to ask about being up to date with vaccinations,” he said. “If someone’s showing up for, for example, to get their COVID-19 vaccine, their provider can ask, ‘Hey, are you up to date with your influenza vaccine?'” Where can you get both vaccines? It may be likely that a family physician’s office will only carry the flu shot, but Conway said he “really hopes that the COVID shot will be available more broadly because that will support the public health message more credibly.”However, he noted that pharmacies “will definitely” have access to both vaccines at the same time and are currently building up the infrastructure to be able to give both.“I would strongly encourage all health care providers to think about giving the COVID shot and doing the things they need to do to have access to it and be able to give both shots at the same time,” he added.

Trending Now From 300 lbs to 100K races: How this mom of 4 took up ultramarathons Ukraine attacks Moscow with 34 drones, biggest strike on the Russian capital Canada relies on data from the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Australia, to help predict what the upcoming flu season could bring, Chagla explained.“This year’s data from Australia looks a little bit more reassuring,” he said. “Respiratory illnesses of the season that lead to influenza-like symptoms, … these numbers seem to be a bit below or at the same level as prior years pre-pandemic.”“There was an early sharp rise and then a decline that happened a bit earlier than expected,” he said, adding that this may happen during Canada’s upcoming flu season, but it’s impossible to fully predict.Using this information, scientists then formulate the flu vaccine by selecting the strains they believe will offer the most effective protection. This usually consists of a quadrivalent vaccine, designed to protect against four different flu viruses, including two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses. Story continues below advertisement 1:59 What you can do to prepare for cold and flu season “When we look at Influenza A, which is the more dominant one and early in the season, it was about 83 per cent of circulating influenza in Australia that would be similar to the vaccine,” he said. “And influenza B, which is what circulates towards the end of the season, it was about 99 per cent.”Dr. Jesse Papenburg, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Montreal Children’s Hospital, believes the influenza vaccine is going to be effective this year.“The data from the Southern Hemisphere that was just released show a roughly 50 per cent reduction in hospitalization for people who received the vaccine compared to those that didn’t,” he said.The best way for families to protect themselves from influenza, particularly if their children are at higher risk because of young age or underlying medical conditions, is to get vaccinated, he added. Story continues below advertisement Papenburg also encourages getting a COVID booster along with the flu shot, if possible.“And that co-administration (of vaccines) hopefully will facilitate things for families because it’s been shown that the giving of the two shots at the same time is not only safe but just as effective.” When will the flu, COVID-19 shots roll out? The exact timing varies between the provinces and territories, but both the flu shot and the updated COVID-19 vaccine are expected to be available in most of the country sometime in October.Some provinces and territories, including Ontario, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories, are first vaccinating high-risk populations, including seniors living in long-term care and retirement homes, before making the COVID and flu shots available to the general public“It’s usually just after Thanksgiving,” Chagla said. “And that’s really to make sure that people have protection throughout the season, not only just in that first bit but even in the tail towards March and April.” Story continues below advertisement — with files from the Canadian Press More on Health More videos From 300 lbs to 100K races: How this mom of 4 took up ultramarathons Veteran mental health highlighted on Remembrance Day: ‘It’s hard to say I’m not OK’ With B.C. teen sick in hospital with suspected bird flu, what should parents know?

(Joe Burbank/The Associated Press)Social SharingEligible Albertans can begin booking their influenza and COVID-19 vaccines starting Oct. 10, the government said Thursday.Appointments will start Oct. 16. There are three different ways to book: by calling 811, directly contacting a clinic, or through the online system. Those living in congregate care will be able to access these vaccinations for COVID-19 and influenza through their facilities starting the week of Oct. 2. "Being immunized for influenza and COVID-19 can help protect you and your loved ones, particularly those most at risk for severe disease," Dr. Mark Joffe, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said in a news release. Health Canada approves Moderna's updated COVID-19 vaccineHealth Canada recently approved Moderna's updated formula for its monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. It targets just the Omicron XBB.1.5 subvariant, which means the vaccine is more tailored to the virus strains currently circulating.Health Canada said Canadians age five and up should receive one dose, regardless of their COVID vaccination history. Meanwhile children from six months to four years old should receive two doses if they have not been previously vaccinated with a COVID vaccine, or one dose if they've previously had at least one dose.Canadian officials expect deliveries to the provinces will start in October.Two other options for fall COVID shots are still in the pipeline.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Priyanka SharmaUpdated27 Sep 2023, 10:14 PM ISTNewsThe health ministry plans to bring two flu drugs, Oseltamivir and Zanamivir, under schedule H1 of the drugs and cosmetic law to ensure they are not sold without a doctor’s prescription because of the potential of misuse. The move also makes it mandatory for chemists to maintain a record of sale and purchase of these drugs. The government has sought comments from stakeholders within one month to move ahead with this decision. A notification issued by the health ministry proposes to amend the drugs rules in consultation with the Drugs Technical Advisory Board to incorporate Oseltamivir and Zanamivir drugs under schedule H1. “These two drugs are antivirals and can be used for all kinds of viral infections. But these drugs are largely used for the treatment of influenza, H1N1 (swine flu) etc. However, it has also shown sensitivity towards Nipah virus infection. Hence, the government plans to bring Oseltamivir and Zanamivir under strict vigilance,” said the state drug controller requesting anonymity. “Now, all pharmacies will have to maintain a register for a record of sale and purchase of these drugs,” the official said.“These records will be inspected from time to time. Besides this, with winter season coming in, cases of influenza are being reported every year. Hence, these drugs should not be misused,” said he official. According to the government, the rules for selling of drugs under schedule H1 will be labelled with the symbol Rx which will be printed red and conspicuously displayed on the left top corner of the label. As of 31 August, India had reported 3,278 influenza cases and 68 related deaths across the country as per data revealed by the National Centre for Disease Control. Queries sent to the health ministry spokesperson did not elicit any response. Catch all the Business News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

From: UK Health Security Agency Published 26 September 2023 The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has launched the first iteration of its new dashboard, which will serve as a centralised source for infectious disease and outbreak data this winter, making it publicly available in a timely and transparent way. The dashboard, which goes live today (Tuesday 26 September), will be updated on Thursday each week. It will initially feature the latest information on a number of respiratory diseases, including: COVID-19 influenza (flu) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adenovirus human metapneumovirus (hMPV) parainfluenza rhinovirus Over time, the data dashboard will be expanded to provide additional health security data, including data relating to incidents of public interest. The new dashboard is still in development and builds on the huge success of the existing COVID-19 dashboard which, at the peak of the third lockdown, had a record 76.5 million hits in just 24 hours. The existing dashboard, developed at the height of the pandemic to make information on the virus publicly available, will remain operational for now and should be considered the current data source for COVID-19. This product will be decommissioned in due course. High levels of influenza during winter 2022 to 2023 and outbreaks of a variety of infectious diseases highlighted the need for UKHSA to be alert to many health threats alongside COVID-19. This new dashboard will allow the agency to share vital data on common winter illnesses that can severely impact communities and health services each year. Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at UKHSA, said: The COVID-19 dashboard was a groundbreaking tool that demonstrated the public’s appetite to understand data and provided local and national decision-makers with crucial information that helped to inform response. It is vital we continue to provide this information in a timely and transparent way. While our new dashboard will initially focus on respiratory diseases, we will look to expand the information we publish constantly, and we would therefore appreciate your feedback on what you would like to see going forward. The winter of 2022 to 2023 highlighted the impact that dual threats such as COVID-19 and influenza can have, and so it’s vital that we make our surveillance data accessible. In preparation for winter, UKHSA has already announced the new phase of the SIREN study, SIREN 2.0. This study will see the team continue to work with NHS sites in the coming months to assess the impact that respiratory diseases and their new strains have on healthcare workers and settings. Data from additional winter surveillance of COVID-19 will also help UKHSA to track BA.2.86 and other variants and will feed into the new data dashboard. Details of this additional surveillance for winter 2023 will be announced shortly.

Residents can book influenza and COVID-19 immunization appointments starting Oct. 10 at an AHS clinic or pharmacy through the province's vaccine booking system, by contacting community health clinics directly or by calling 8-1-1. Albertans living in congregate care, which include long-term care accommodations and licensed supportive living accommodations, will be able to access vaccinations starting next week on Oct. 2 through their facilities . According to Alberta Health Services, all Albertans six months and older are eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The news comes as the number of COVID-19 cases in Alberta rises. As of Sept. 26, Alberta Health Services reported 16 acute-care centres across the province are dealing with outbreaks on 26 units, with 153 patients and 44 healthcare workers testing positive for the virus. Of those, five acute-care facilities, 15 units, 72 patients and 10 healthcare workers are in the Edmonton Zone. The Alberta government has not updated its COVID-19 dashboard with up-to-date statistics detailing the number of people affected by the virus. Heather Smith, the president of United Nurses of Alberta — the union that represents registered nurses in the province — said Thursday that the public deserves to know the information so they can take steps to protect themselves and others. "There is a level of concern that there is a lackadaisical approach to what is a real threat," Smith told CTV News Edmonton. "The absence of information ... the public has a right to know whether or not those numbers are going up, just in terms of making decisions about their own safety and appropriate precautions." Alberta Health told CTV News Edmonton early Thursday evening that from Sept. 3-23, there were more than 1,400 cases of COVID-19, 286 new hospitalizations, 13 ICU admissions, and 20 deaths from the virus. Provincial Health Minister Adriana LaGrange said Thursday in a news release her ministry will unveil "a refreshed dashboard "a refreshed dashboard with up-to-date data that will align reporting on respiratory illnesses including COVID-19, RSV and influenza," echoing what she said 10 days ago, and that it will be available "very soon." LaGrange said there has been 52 cases of influenza reported since Sept. 3, resulting in 10 hospitalizations but no deaths or admissions to intensive care, and 21 confirmed cases of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.
