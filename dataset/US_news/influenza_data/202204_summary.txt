- Influenza vaccination is recommended for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and other high-risk populations, but the effectiveness of current vaccination strategies is unclear.
- A study found that antibody responses to influenza vaccine varied between vaccine strains, with the highest rates of seroconversion seen with novel strains.
- The study also found that vaccine responses were similar in COPD patients and healthy participants.
- Factors such as vaccine strain, hypertension, and latitude were identified as independent predictors of seroconversion.
- The findings suggest that there may be a need to personalize the yearly influenza vaccine to improve individual antibody responses and protection.
