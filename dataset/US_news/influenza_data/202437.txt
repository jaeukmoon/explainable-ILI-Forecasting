If you are at higher risk, flu vaccination is especially important. When you get vaccinated, you reduce your risk of getting sick with flu and possibly being hospitalized or dying from flu. CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people at higher risk of serious flu complications who have flu infection or suspected flu infection. People at increased risk Adults 65 years and older Children younger than 2 years old1 People with asthma People with chronic lung disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] and cystic fibrosis) People with neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions People with blood disorders (such as sickle cell disease) People with endocrine disorders (such as diabetes mellitus) People with heart disease (such as congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease) People with kidney disorders People with liver disorders People with metabolic disorders (such as inherited metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders) People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher People younger than 19 years old on long-term aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications. People with a weakened immune system due to disease (such as people with HIV or AIDS, or some cancers such as leukemia) or medications (such as those receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer, or persons with chronic conditions requiring chronic corticosteroids or other drugs that suppress the immune system) People who have had a stroke People with certain disabilities—especially those who may have trouble with muscle function, lung function, or difficulty coughing, swallowing, or clearing fluids from their airways. Other people at higher risk from flu: Pregnant people and people up to 2 weeks after the end of pregnancy People who live in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities People from certain racial and ethnic minority groups are at increased risk for hospitalization with flu, including non-Hispanic Black persons, Hispanic or Latino persons, and American Indian or Alaska Native persons 1 Although all children younger than 5 years old are considered at higher risk of serious flu complications, the highest risk is for those younger than 2 years old, with the highest hospitalization and death rates among infants younger than 6 months old. Flu and people with chronic conditions Adults with certain chronic conditions are at higher risk of developing serious complications from flu. In fact, during recent flu seasons, 9 out of 10 people hospitalized with flu had at least one underlying health condition – that's why getting an annual flu vaccine is especially important for people with certain chronic health conditions A flu vaccine reduces the risk of getting sick with flu. For people with certain chronic health conditions a flu vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of flu-related worsening of chronic conditions and prevent flu-associated hospitalization. Prevention Flu Vaccination is the Best Protection The best way to prevent flu and its potentially serious complications is for everyone 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year. It is especially important for people who are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications to be vaccinated each year. Other Preventive Actions In addition to getting a flu vaccine, people with asthma should take the same everyday preventive actions CDC recommends for everyone, including avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs, and washing hands often. This also can include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces. More information is available about core and additional prevention strategies. Treatment CDC recommends early flu antiviral treatment for people who have flu or suspected flu who are at higher risk of serious flu complications.

These updated guidelines provide recommendations on the management of both severe and non-severe influenza and also includes recommendations on the use of antiviral medications to prevent influenza virus infection in individuals exposed to the virus in the previous 48 hours. This update applies to patients with seasonal influenza viruses, pandemic influenza viruses and novel influenza A viruses known to cause severe illness in infected humans. This update also includes baseline risk estimates for hospitalization and death and proposed definitions of patients at high or extremely high risk of developing severe influenza, so as to enable the recommendations to be targeted appropriately.

In the absence of a bacterial superinfection, prescribing antibacterial therapies is not indicated but has become a common clinical practice for those presenting with a respiratory viral illness. In a murine model, we found that antibiotic use during influenza infection impaired the lung innate immunologic defenses toward a secondary challenge with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Antibiotics augment lung eosinophils, which have inhibitory effects on macrophage function through the release of major basic protein. Moreover, we demonstrated that antibiotic treatment during influenza infection caused a fungal dysbiosis that drove lung eosinophilia and impaired MRSA clearance. Finally, we evaluated 3 cohorts of hospitalized patients and found that eosinophils positively correlated with antibiotic use, systemic inflammation, and worsened outcomes. Altogether, our work demonstrates a detrimental effect of antibiotic treatment during influenza infection that has harmful immunologic consequences via recruitment of eosinophils to the lungs, thereby increasing the risk of developing a secondary bacterial infection. Graphical Abstract Introduction Influenza causes a high global burden of disease, with some estimates of attributed mortality exceeding 500,000 people annually (1, 2). The 1918–1919 influenza pandemic was particularly devastating, accounting for up to 100 million deaths worldwide (3). A major cause of mortality from influenza is development of a secondary bacterial pneumonia (4, 5). As such, the extraordinary mortality during the 1918–1919 pandemic could have been reduced if pneumococcal vaccination and antibiotics were available (6, 7). Because of the concerns for a secondary bacterial infection complicating viral pneumonia, empiric antibiotic use has become a common clinical practice (4, 5, 8–10). In fact, clinical guidelines have even suggested initiation of prophylactic antibiotics in patients presenting with a severe influenza infection (11). During the COVID-19 pandemic, antibiotics were prescribed in nearly 75% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, although bacterial coinfection rates were less than 10% (12). Antibiotic use during SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with an increase in bloodstream infections by gut bacteria (13). Therefore, empiric antibiotics in those with severe viral pneumonias will result in overprescription of these medicines where there is no clinical benefit and potential harm. Indeed, antibiotics can contribute to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and increase the risk of antibiotic-associated adverse drug events that prolong length of hospital stay (14). We postulated that the prescription of antibiotics during influenza infection has detrimental effects that increase the risk of developing a bacterial superinfection. In a 2-hit model in which mice were first infected with influenza followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, treatment of mice with a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail of vancomycin, neomycin, ampicillin, and metronidazole (VNAM) impaired lung immunity against MRSA challenge after influenza infection. VNAM induced the recruitment of eosinophils to the lungs, and we provide evidence that eosinophils can suppress macrophage clearance of MRSA through the release of eosinophil major basic protein (MBP-1). Furthermore, we demonstrated that gut fungal dysbiosis caused by antibiotics induced eosinophil recruitment, impaired MRSA clearance, and worsened lung inflammation in the 2-hit model. Human studies also corroborated our finding that eosinophil levels correlate with antibiotic use, systemic inflammation, and adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients. Results Antibiotic use during influenza infection impairs MRSA clearance and worsens lung injury. The onset of a secondary bacterial infection after the initial viral illness is classically described as the recrudescence of symptoms (i.e., redevelopment of respiratory illness after an initial phase of recovery) (15). To replicate this clinical scenario, we established a murine model where mice were infected with influenza (PR8), which peaks in severity on day 7 after infection, followed by a subsequent MRSA challenge at day 10 (Figure 1A) (16). MRSA was used because recent epidemiological evidence indicates that S. aureus is the most common pathogen causing a secondary bacterial pneumonia (4, 17). Additionally, mice were treated with either control or broad-spectrum antibiotics in the drinking water starting at 7 days before PR8 infection to allow animals to acclimate to VNAM (vancomycin, neomycin, ampicillin, and metronidazole). Figure 1Antibiotic treatment of mice during influenza infection impairs bacterial clearance and augments lung inflammation after a subsequent challenge with MRSA. (A) Mice were infected with influenza (PR8, 500 PFU) at day 0 followed by MRSA at day 10. Control or antibiotics (VNAM) were started 7 days before PR8 infection to allow mice to equilibrate to the treatment and discontinued at day 7 to allow it to wash out before MRSA challenge. (B) Weight relative to that at day 10 showed a slower recovery after MRSA challenge in the VNAM-treated group (n = 18) compared with control (n = 31) at days 11 and 12 (1 and 2 days after MRSA infection, respectively). (C) Representative images from 3 different H&E-stained lungs at day 11 of the 2-hit model. Scale bars: 2 mm (left), 500 μm (right). (D–I) Mice were sacrificed on day 12 after the 2-hit infection; the lungs were evaluated for CFU of bacteria (n = 26 and 21 for control and VNAM groups, respectively) (D), and BAL was evaluated for IFN-γ levels (n = 13 and 12 for control and VNAM groups, respectively) (E), total cell count (n = 26 and 21 for control and VNAM groups, respectively) (F), PMN count (n = 13 and 12 for control and VNAM groups, respectively) (G), macrophages (n = 9 and 8 for control and VNAM groups, respectively) (H), and eosinophils (n = 12 and 13 for control and VNAM groups, respectively) (I). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005, ****P < 0.0001 by 2-tailed Student’s t test. With the 2-hit model, VNAM-treated compared with control mice had significantly greater weight loss (Figure 1B) and more histological evidence of lung injury (Figure 1C). Additionally, antibiotic treatment during influenza infection had a paradoxical effect on a subsequent bacterial challenge with the VNAM group having higher MRSA colony-forming units (CFU) in the lungs compared with control (Figure 1D). IFN-γ was also elevated in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of VNAM versus control 2 days after MRSA infection (Figure 1E). Furthermore, VNAM-treated mice had higher total cell count, neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils in the BAL compared with control (Figure 1, F–I, and Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI180986DS1). These data suggest that antibiotic treatment during influenza infection impairs MRSA clearance. Notably, the increased lung injury caused by antibiotic use was specific to the 2-hit model. VNAM had no effect on bacterial clearance and lung inflammation from MRSA infection alone (Supplemental Figure 2). Similarly, influenza alone had similar levels of lung inflammation between both control and VNAM conditions (Supplemental Figure 3). We also performed the 2-hit model using PR8 infection followed by S. pneumoniae and found that VNAM treatment increased lung inflammation compared with control (Supplemental Figure 4), suggesting that the detrimental effects of antibiotics are generalized to the various causes of bacterial superinfections. Furthermore, no difference in lung inflammation was noted on day 10 after influenza infection (Supplemental Figure 5), which is the time point of MRSA infection in the 2-hit model, further supporting that the effect of antibiotics is specific to post-influenza MRSA pneumonia. Altogether, these data indicate that antibiotic use during influenza infection has negative consequences that diminish bacterial clearance and worsen lung injury after a secondary bacterial challenge. Antibiotic use during influenza infection augments lung eosinophils, which reduce MRSA clearance and increase lung injury. Lung eosinophils increased in the lungs over the time course of the influenza infection but were higher in VNAM-treated mice compared with control (Figure 1I and Figure 2, A–C). Therefore, we tested whether eosinophils were the effectors that impaired lung innate immunity caused by antibiotics during the PR8-MRSA injury. Mice were treated with either an isotype or an anti–IL-5 antibody (Figure 2D), which effectively suppressed lung eosinophils (Figure 2E). Eosinophil depletion attenuated the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the BAL (Figure 2, F and G) and improved lung barrier function (Figure 2H). IL-5 inhibition also reduced the MRSA burden in the lungs (Figure 2I) and BAL levels of IFN-γ and IL-1β (Figure 2, J and K). These data support the concept that antibiotic-induced eosinophils mediate the reduced ability to clear MRSA and worsened lung inflammation after influenza infection. Figure 2Depletion of eosinophils improves bacterial clearance and lung inflammation in the antibiotic-treated group injured with influenza followed by MRSA. (A and B) BAL eosinophil numbers (A) and percentages (B) in control and VNAM-treated mice infected with influenza (PR8, 250 PFU) (n = 3–4). (C) EoCre × ROSAmTmG transgenic mice were treated with control or VNAM and then injured with influenza (PR8, 250 PFU). Mice were sacrificed on day 10 after influenza infection, and lung slices were immunostained for GFP (eosinophils; green) and DAPI (blue). Image is representative of 3 different samples. Scale bars: 100 μm. (D) Mice were infected with influenza (PR8, 250 PFU) at day 0 followed by MRSA at day 10. Control or antibiotics (VNAM) were started 7 days before PR8 infection to allow mice to equilibrate to the treatment and discontinued at day 7 to allow it to wash out before MRSA challenge. Mice were given intraperitoneal injections of either an isotype antibody (n = 7–10) or an anti–IL-5 antibody (n = 7–10) every 3–4 days. (E) BAL eosinophils were effectively depleted after IL-5 antibody treatment. (F and G) Total cell count (F) and PMNs (G) in the BAL were evaluated 1 and 2 days after MRSA infection (days 11 and 12, respectively). (H–K) Mice were sacrificed on day 12 and evaluated for total protein in the BAL (H), CFU of bacteria in the lungs (I), BAL IFN-γ levels (J), and BAL IL-1β levels (K). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 by 2-way ANOVA. Antibiotic treatment during influenza infection impairs macrophage function in vivo. The alveolar macrophage plays a predominant role in bacterial phagocytosis and clearance within the airspaces (18, 19). To evaluate whether antibiotics affect the alveolar macrophage transcriptome in vivo, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of the lungs from control and VNAM conditions (Figure 3). The VNAM effects on lung immunity during influenza infection were seen within 1 day after MRSA infection (Figure 1), suggesting that changes were present by the time of the bacterial challenge. Thus, we chose day 10 after influenza infection (without an MRSA challenge) for the scRNA-Seq analysis (Figure 3A). Figure 3Antibiotic treatment of mice during influenza infection attenuates interstitial macrophage numbers and causes transcriptomic changes in alveolar macrophages consistent with an immunosuppressive phenotype. (A) Mice were infected with influenza (PR8, 250 PFU) at day 0. Control or antibiotics (VNAM) were started 7 days before PR8 infection to allow mice to equilibrate to the treatment and discontinued at day 7. (B–O) Lungs from mice sacrificed at day 10 were processed for scRNA-Seq (B, C, and H–O) and flow cytometry (D–G).

The complete list of DEGs between control and VNAM in alveolar macrophages is given in Supplemental Table 1. Adjusted P value: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. mϕ, macrophage. Although we were able to identify most immune cell types in the lungs after influenza infection (Figure 3B and Supplemental Figure 6), eosinophils were not found, owing to their fragility and high RNase content that impede identification by scRNA-Seq analysis (20, 21). Therefore, we focus on macrophages, which are important phagocytes that mediate pathogen clearance in the lungs (22). We identified tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages, and monocyte-derived macrophages in the scRNA-Seq data set, and a relative decrease in interstitial macrophage population was noted in the VNAM-treated group compared with control (Figure 3C). Flow cytometry analysis of lung macrophage subsets after influenza infection confirmed lower interstitial macrophage numbers after VNAM treatment compared with control (Figure 3, D–G, and Supplemental Figure 7). Next, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in macrophage subsets between the control and VNAM conditions were determined (Supplemental Table 1). We found 673 genes in tissue-resident alveolar macrophages to be significantly different (adjusted P < 0.01) between control and VNAM groups (Figure 3H and Supplemental Table 1). However, only 29 and 4 DEGs were identified in interstitial macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages, respectively (Supplemental Table 1). Because the transcriptome was largely unchanged in interstitial and monocyte-derived macrophages between control and VNAM conditions, we focused our downstream analysis on the DEGs in alveolar macrophages. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was performed using the DEGs between control and VNAM in alveolar macrophages to understand the signaling implications of the transcriptomic changes (Supplemental Table 2). We used the Disease and Function Analysis module in IPA to determine the predicted downstream functional alterations caused by antibiotic treatment (Figure 3I). The analysis demonstrated the negative immunomodulatory effects of antibiotic treatment during influenza infection with suppression of pertinent immunologic functions in the VNAM group, such as “engulfment of cells,” “immune response of cells,” “leukocyte migration,” “phagocytosis,” “recruitment of blood cells,” and “response of phagocytes.” Accordingly, we evaluated expression of various phagocytosis receptors and found that alveolar macrophages in VNAM-treated mice had lower expression of Cd14, Marco, Clec4d, Fcgr1, Fcgr2b, and Fcgr3 (Figure 3, J–O). These data support the concept that antibiotic use during influenza infection impairs lung immunity potentially through reduction of interstitial macrophage numbers and impairment of alveolar macrophage phagocytosis, which could result in an attenuated ability to clear potential pathogens from the airspaces. Antibiotic-induced lung eosinophils impair macrophage clearance of bacteria through the secretion of MBP-1. Given our observations that antibiotic treatment during influenza infection augments lung eosinophils (Figure 2) and the transcriptomic data suggesting impairment of alveolar macrophage phagocytosis (Figure 3), we postulated that eosinophils negatively regulate the behavior of macrophages and suppress their ability to clear bacteria during influenza infection. To test this hypothesis, we cultured macrophages in conditioned medium from eosinophils versus control and evaluated transcriptomic changes. We used the Disease and Function Analysis in IPA to evaluate the DEGs (Supplemental Table 3) that were significantly different between conditions and found that the addition of eosinophil conditioned medium suppressed immunologic pathways in the macrophages including “engulfment by macrophages,” “immune response of phagocytes,” “phagocytosis by macrophages,” and “response of phagocytes” (Figure 4A and Supplemental Table 4). Similar to the findings in alveolar macrophages (Figure 3), eosinophil conditioned medium attenuated expression of several phagocytosis receptors (Supplemental Figure 8). Figure 4Eosinophils suppress macrophage phagocytosis through secretion of MBP-1. (A and B) Macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells) were processed for RNA-Seq. DEGs (see Supplemental Table 3 for entire DEG list) were analyzed with IPA. (A) Macrophages were cultured in conditioned medium from either eosinophils or epithelial cells as a control. Disease and Function Analysis was performed, and nonredundant pathways (|z score| > 2) were visualized. See Supplemental Table 4 for the complete list of pathways. (B) Macrophages were cultured in eosinophil conditioned medium with addition of an isotype or anti–MBP-1 antibody. Disease and Function Analysis was performed, and nonredundant pathways (|z score| > 2) were visualized. See Supplemental Table 4 for the complete list. (C) MRSA was cultured alone, with macrophages, or with macrophages and primary eosinophils for 4 hours and MRSA CFU was calculated.

(E) CFU of MRSA cultured for 4 hours alone, with macrophages, or with macrophages and conditioned medium from primary eosinophils (n = 11). **P < 0.01 by repeated-measures 1-way ANOVA and post hoc analysis. (F) CFU of MRSA cultured for 2 hours with macrophages plus addition of control (BSA) or recombinant MBP-1 (n = 4). *P < 0.05 by 2-tailed Student’s t test. (G) Fluorescence intensity over time reflects phagocytosis of pHrodo-labeled S. aureus bioparticles (n = 4). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 by repeated-measures 2-way ANOVA. (H and I) Effect of MBP-1 on phagocytosis of S. aureus bioparticles by murine alveolar macrophages in vivo (control, n = 13; MBP-1, n = 15) (H) and in an ex vivo PCLS culture (control, n = 5; MBP-1, n = 4) (I). *P < 0.05 by 2-tailed Student’s t test. The ability of eosinophil conditioned medium to negatively affect macrophage function suggested that eosinophils facilitate the effect through secreted factors. Eosinophils release prepackaged cationic proteins such as MBP-1 to mediate their immunomodulatory effects (23). As such, we tested whether MBP-1 secretion could suppress macrophage functions by adding an anti–MBP-1 antibody to the eosinophil conditioned medium. Compared with an isotype antibody, MBP-1 blockade reversed the inhibitory effect of eosinophil conditioned medium on macrophage function. Indeed, pathways such as “antimicrobial response,” “antiviral response,” “cell movement of blood cells,” “cell infiltration of myeloid cells,” “engulfment of cells,” “immune response of cells,” “migration of cells,” and “response of phagocytes” were augmented by MBP-1 inhibition in eosinophil conditioned medium (Figure 4B and Supplemental Table 4). Similarly, MBP-1 blockade reversed the effects of eosinophil conditioned medium on expression of Fcgr1, Fcgr2b, and Fcgr3 (Supplemental Figure 8). The transcriptomic analyses suggest that eosinophils suppress immunologic pathways in macrophages needed for bacterial clearance. Therefore, we established a bacterial killing assay in which macrophages were cultured with MRSA either alone or in the presence of eosinophils (Figure 4C). Whereas macrophages suppressed bacterial growth, both eosinophils and eosinophil conditioned medium antagonized macrophages such that bacterial CFUs were similar to MRSA-only conditions (Figure 4, D and E, respectively). To determine how eosinophils impaired macrophage ability to suppress MRSA growth, we added recombinant MBP-1 to bacteria and macrophage cocultures, which augmented MRSA counts compared with control conditions (Figure 4F). Pretreatment of macrophages or MRSA with recombinant MBP-1 with removal during coculture had no effect on macrophage suppression of bacteria growth (Supplemental Figure 9, A and B). Moreover, MBP-1 treatment of MRSA alone had no effect on bacterial growth (Supplemental Figure 9C). These data are congruous with the transcriptomic evaluation and demonstrate eosinophil suppression of macrophage function via MBP-1 secretion. Notably, alveolar macrophages in VNAM-treated mice compared with control had suppression of phagocytosis pathways (Figure 3D) and receptors (Figure 3, E–J). Similarly, macrophages treated with eosinophil conditioned medium had suppressed phagocytosis by transcriptomic evaluation (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figure 8). Therefore, we evaluated macrophage engulfment of S. aureus bioparticles and found that the addition of recombinant MBP-1 or eosinophil conditioned medium impaired phagocytosis (Figure 4G). Because the scRNA-Seq suggested that VNAM treatment has specific effects on tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, we developed phagocytosis assays that used primary tissue-resident alveolar macrophages. Alveolar macrophages change their phenotype when removed from their native microenvironment (24–27). Therefore, we developed assays that maintained these cells in the lung niche. First, we instilled S. aureus bioparticles into the lungs of mice and found that coadministration of recombinant MBP-1 suppressed phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages in vivo (Figure 4H). Next, we created a phagocytosis assay using precision-cut lung slice cultures of mouse lungs, which contain alveolar macrophages. Consistent with our previously described results, MBP-1 suppressed phagocytosis of S. aureus bioparticles compared with control (Figure 4I). These data indicate that eosinophils inhibit alveolar macrophage ability to phagocytose and suppress bacterial growth through the release of MBP-1. Antibiotics cause a fungal dysbiosis that augments lung eosinophilia and lung injury. Next, we wanted to understand the mechanism by which antibiotics caused eosinophils to accumulate in the lungs during influenza infection. Antibiotics perturb the homeostatic interactions between the microbiome and host (28), so we postulated that gut dysbiosis contributed to lung eosinophilia. As expected, broad antibacterial effects of VNAM depleted the gut of bacterial microbiota and induced gut dysbiosis (Supplemental Figure 10 and Supplemental Table 5). Disrupting one niche of the microbiome ecosystem can impact another (29, 30). In particular, antibiotic suppression of the bacterial microbiome provides a permissive environment that allows fungi (i.e., the mycobiome) to expand (31). Indeed, VNAM treatment caused a more than 11-fold increase in fungal burden compared with control (Figure 5A). Figure 5Antibiotics cause fungal dysbiosis during the influenza-MRSA 2-hit challenge. (A) Stool was collected at days 0 and 7 from VNAM (n = 5 and 4, respectively) and control (n = 4) groups for ITS PCR. *P < 0.001 by 2-tailed Student’s t test. (B–I) ITS sequencing of the stool collected at the designated time points from control and VNAM-treated mice infected with influenza (day 0) followed by MRSA (day 10). (B) Chao index showed no difference in α-diversity (n = 3–4). (C) Principal coordinates analysis demonstrated changes in β-diversity at day 12 (n = 3–4). (D and E) Relative abundance for individual samples at day 10 of the 2-hit model in control (n = 4) and VNAM (n = 5) groups at the family (D) and genus (E) levels. The top 10 families or genera are shown, and all others are cumulatively reported in the “Other” group. (F–I) The relative abundance at the genus level was significantly higher in the VNAM (n = 5) compared with the control (n = 4) group for Saccharomyces (F), Malassezia (G), Filobasidium (H), and Bullera (I). *P < 0.05 by 2-tailed Student’s t test. To characterize the gut fungal dysbiosis, we performed internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing of the stool from control and VNAM-treated mice infected with influenza (Supplemental Table 5). The α-diversity of fungal species had little change between conditions at all time points (Figure 5B). In contrast, the mycobiome β-diversity was significantly different between control and VNAM (Figure 5C). The ITS sequencing revealed changes in the relative abundance of intestinal fungi (Figure 5, D and E). However, significant differences between control and VNAM groups were found with a few genera, such as Saccharomyces (Figure 5F), Malassezia (Figure 5G), Filobasidium (Figure 5H), and Bullera (Figure 5I). We and others have demonstrated that gut fungal dysbiosis can have distal effects in the lungs and exacerbate allergic airways disease (32–35). Therefore, we postulated that antibiotic-induced expansion of the gut mycobiome could also affect the lung innate immunity required for clearance of bacteria that are aspirated into the lower airspaces. The VNAM group was concomitantly treated with fluconazole, an antifungal agent, to suppress fungal overgrowth during antibiotic administration (Figure 6A). We found that the group with VNAM and fluconazole cotreatment was similar to the controls and had significantly less weight loss and fewer inflammatory cells in the BAL compared with the VNAM group (Figure 6, B–D). Notably, fluconazole treatment reversed the lung eosinophilia caused by VNAM during influenza infection (Figure 6, E–G). Moreover, we also found that MBP-1 levels, which increased with VNAM treatment compared with control, were reduced with cotreatment with fluconazole (Figure 6H). The VNAM plus fluconazole group also had reduced IFN-γ (Figure 6I), IL-1β (Figure 6J), and MRSA CFU in the lungs (Figure 6, K and L) when compared with VNAM-only treatment. These data demonstrated that antibiotics augment lung eosinophils and lung inflammation whereas suppression of fungal expansion with fluconazole attenuated the effect. Figure 6Cotreatment with fluconazole improves bacterial clearance and reverses the worsened lung injury in antibiotic-treated mice. (A) Mice were infected with influenza (PR8, 250 PFU) at day 0 followed by MRSA at day 10. Control, antibiotics alone (VNAM), or VNAM and cotreatment with fluconazole (VNAM+Fluco) were started 7 days before PR8 infection to allow mice to equilibrate to the treatment and discontinued at day 7 to allow it to wash out before MRSA challenge. (B) Weight relative to that on day 10 showed slower recovery after MRSA challenge in the VNAM-treated group (n = 22) compared with control (n = 21) and VNAM+Fluco (n = 13) groups at days 11 and 12 (1 and 2 days after MRSA infection, respectively) by 2-way ANOVA. ****P < 0.0001 in post hoc analysis at day 12. (C–L) Mice in control (C), VNAM (V), and VNAM+Fluco (VF) groups were injured in the 2-hit model and sacrificed for evaluation of (C) day 11 BAL total cell count (C: n = 9; V: n = 10; VF: n = 10); (D) day 12 BAL cell count (C: n = 22; V: n = 15; VF: n = 10); (E) day 10 BAL eosinophil count (C: n = 5; V: n = 4; VF: n = 3); (F) day 11 BAL eosinophil count (C: n = 26; V: n = 24; VF: n = 8); (G) day 12 BAL eosinophil count (C: n = 13; V: n = 12; VF: n = 9); (H) day 10 lung MBP-1 levels (C: n = 4; V: n = 4; VF: n = 5); (I) day 12 BAL IFN-γ levels (C: n = 4; V: n = 4; VF: n = 5); (J) day 12 BAL IL-1β levels (C: n = 4; V: n = 4; VF: n = 5); (K) day 11 lung MRSA CFU (C: n = 9; V: n = 10; VF: n = 9); and (L) day 12 lung MRSA CFU (C: n = 27; V: n = 21; VF: n = 8). (C–L) One-way ANOVA with post hoc analysis was used to determine P values within the respective panels. ANOVA P values are listed in each panel. Post hoc comparisons are represented as follows: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Two microbiome compartments, the lung and the gut, have important roles in lung health and disease (28). Accordingly, we repeated the fungal suppression experiments by cotreating with VNAM and oral amphotericin, an antifungal that is poorly absorbed by the gut and, hence, will attenuate gut fungi and have minimal effects in the lungs. Amphotericin treatment led to significant improvement compared with VNAM alone, which phenocopied the fluconazole experiments (Supplemental Figure 11). Altogether, these data suggest that antibiotic use during influenza infection causes expansion of the gut mycobiome driven by multiple fungal organisms. The fungal expansion has distal effects in the lungs (i.e., gut-lung axis) and augments the number of lung eosinophils, which our prior results (Figure 4) indicate can suppress macrophage phagocytosis of MRSA. Eosinophil levels correlate with increased length of stay and more inflammation in hospitalized patients. Our data suggest that eosinophils may have negative effects on lung immunity. We immunostained for MBP-1 in the lungs of a patient who died from a secondary bacterial pneumonia after influenza infection and identified many eosinophils (Figure 7A and Supplemental Figure 12). Next, we evaluated data from patients admitted with an influenza infection at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and found an increase in peripheral eosinophil counts in those treated with antibiotics (Figure 7B and Supplemental Table 6). Furthermore, we evaluated a cohort of patients hospitalized in the Northwestern Memorial Hospital intensive care unit (ICU) who required mechanical ventilation and found a similar increase in eosinophil counts with antibiotic administration (Figure 7C and Supplemental Table 6). Additionally, days of antibiotic use during the ICU hospitalization positively correlated with peripheral eosinophil counts (Figure 7D) and BAL eosinophil percentage (Figure 7E). Figure 7Eosinophils correlate with antibiotic use and worsen clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients. (A) Lungs from an uninfected patient and one who died from influenza followed by MRSA infection were immunostained for MBP-1 to identify eosinophils (green fluorescence) and counterstained with DAPI (blue). See Supplemental Figure 12 for a representative image of the lungs from a patient who died from influenza with S. pneumoniae superinfection. Scale bars: 100 μm. (B) Initial and final eosinophil levels in peripheral blood of patients hospitalized for influenza infection on antibiotics for more than 4 days (n = 131). (C) Initial and final eosinophil levels in peripheral blood of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation and on antibiotics for more than 4 days (n = 121). (D and E) Mean eosinophils in peripheral blood (n = 175) (D) and BAL (E) correlated with days of antibiotic use in the ICU (n = 186). (F) Mean eosinophils in peripheral blood correlated with hospital length of stay for influenza patients (n = 229). (G and H) Mean eosinophils in peripheral blood (n = 175) (G) and BAL (n = 186) (H) correlated with length of stay in the ICU. (I–N) Eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) was measured in plasma of ICU patients. (I and J) Violin plot of EPX levels in ICU patients with ARDS (n = 51) compared with those at risk (n = 67) (I) and with pneumonia (PNA; n = 96) compared with those without pneumonia (No PNA; n = 23) (J). (K–N) EPX levels were correlated with plasma levels (n = 119) of IL-6 (K), CX3CL1 (L), ANG-2 (M), and soluble TNFR1 (N). Data presented from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) (B and F), Northwestern University (NU) (C–E, G, and H), and University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) (I–N). The data presented include all the patients within respective cohorts. Patient demographics for each cohort are described in Supplemental Table 7. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001 by 2-tailed Student’s t test (B, C, I, and J). Spearman’s correlation was used to determine association between various parameters (D–H and K–N). Because our data demonstrated that eosinophils impair alveolar macrophages from clearing MRSA, we predicted that elevated eosinophil levels may be a negative prognostic factor for patients hospitalized for influenza. Indeed, peripheral blood eosinophil levels were associated with a longer length of stay (LOS) in the hospital for influenza (Figure 7F). Furthermore, eosinophil levels in the blood (Figure 7G) and lungs (Figure 7H) positively correlated with the ICU LOS. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that eosinophils significantly increase with antibiotic use and are associated with increased LOS. Next, in a cohort of mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Supplemental Table 6), we measured plasma eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) as a surrogate marker for eosinophil levels (36). Plasma EPX levels were higher in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) versus those at risk (Figure 7I). Patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia also had higher EPX plasma levels compared with those without pneumonia (Figure 7J). Furthermore, plasma EPX levels positively correlated with several inflammation and injury biomarkers, such as IL-6 (Figure 7K), CX3CL1 (Figure 7L), ANG-2 (Figure 7M), and soluble TNFR1 (Figure 7N). These data further corroborate our findings in the Cedars-Sinai and Northwestern cohorts and demonstrate that EPX positively correlates with inflammation in hospitalized ICU patients. Discussion The practice of prescribing antibiotics for viral infections is a widespread problem (8–10, 37). Our study highlights the pernicious effects of antibiotic use during viral infections and defines a mechanism whereby antibiotics perturb the gut mycobiome and result in lung eosinophilia. In turn, lung eosinophils, via release of MBP-1, suppress alveolar macrophage clearance of bacteria. Clinical evidence also demonstrated that eosinophil levels positively correlate with antibiotic use, systemic inflammation, and ICU LOS. Altogether, our work indicates that antibiotic use may be counterproductive during influenza infection and attenuate antibacterial immunity. Microaspiration of nasopharyngeal secretions into the lungs is a common occurrence in healthy individuals, but infections rarely occur as the contents are rapidly cleared by immunologic mechanisms that have evolved within the nonsterile airspaces (38, 39). However, respiratory viral infections impair host defense mechanisms, thereby providing aspirated commensal flora an opportunity to establish an infection (40). In fact, most bacterial pneumonias are precipitated by an antecedent viral infection (41). Therefore, common causes of pneumonia are, predictably, nasal commensals such as S. aureus and S. pneumoniae (40). Moreover, critically ill patients with S. aureus colonization have a 15-fold increased risk of developing pneumonia (42). Development of bacterial pneumonia after an influenza infection is due to a complex host-pathogen interrelation that includes synergy between bacterial and viral virulence factors and disruption of host immunologic functions that normally prevent bacteria growth in the lower respiratory tract (43). Our data corroborate this interaction, as the antibiotic-driven effect in worsening lung injury occurred only in the coinfection model and was not seen in the single-injury models with influenza or MRSA alone. Moreover, the single-injury model with MRSA had clearance of bacteria from the lungs by the second day after infection, whereas in the 2-hit model, MRSA was still persistent at high levels 2 days after bacterial challenge. A preceding influenza infection primes the lung microenvironment to be more susceptible to bacterial superinfection (44). Indeed, influenza infection attenuates alveolar macrophage numbers and disrupts several immunologic pathways required for bacterial recognition (18, 19, 45, 46). Our work suggests that antibiotic treatment during influenza infection confers an additional risk that further attenuates effective macrophage clearance of bacteria. Antibiotics have beneficial effects in helping eradicate bacterial infections, but inappropriate use can also have negative consequences. Antibiotics increase the risk of bloodstream infections by gut bacteria during SARS-CoV-2 infection (13). The current work further demonstrates the deleterious effects of antibiotics on lung host defense. Teleologically, eosinophils have a role in antiviral immunity and are likely recruited to the lung in that capacity during influenza infection (47–49). However, our findings demonstrate that eosinophils have detrimental immunologic consequences by suppressing macrophage antibacterial immunity mediated via the secretion of MBP-1. Accordingly, eosinophil recruitment may represent a homeostatic role in facilitating resolution of inflammation and repair during influenza infection but have harmful bystander effects on host immunity necessary for the clearance of aspirated bacteria. Eosinophils are commonly associated with type 2 inflammation such as that found with allergic and helminthic diseases (50). However, the current work defines a role for eosinophils in negatively regulating lung immunity. Peripheral eosinophil levels are higher in those with severe COVID-19 compared with those with moderate illness (51), which is consistent with our findings that eosinophils may have detrimental immunologic consequences during viral illness. Eosinophilia is a common occurrence in patients receiving antibiotics (52). Though it is often presumed to be secondary to a drug reaction, we provide evidence that antibiotic-induced fungal dysbiosis drives the increase in lung eosinophils. We also found eosinophil levels correlated with the hospital LOS for influenza patients and ICU LOS for patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Additionally, plasma EPX levels were higher in those with ARDS compared with those at risk, which is consistent with the fact that the intensity of EPX immunostaining is increased in the lungs of patients with ARDS compared with control (53). Elevated eosinophils in the BAL have been associated with worse outcomes in lung transplant patients and are notably associated with fungal infection (54). Several studies in experimental murine models of lung fibrosis have also found that eosinophils are profibrotic (55–57). Our study therefore adds to the growing evidence that eosinophils have harmful effects that promote nonallergic inflammation in both acute and chronic lung diseases. The current practice guidelines recommend that empiric antibiotics should be started for those presenting with symptoms consistent with a community-acquired pneumonia but should be promptly discontinued if a respiratory viral infection (e.g., influenza, SARS-CoV-2) is identified (58). Without question, antibiotics serve a purpose in treating bacterial infections, but their misuse when no bacterial infection exists may increase health risks to both the individual and the general public. The current study identifies a paradoxical effect of antibiotic use during influenza infection whereby lung defenses have diminished capacity to defend against a subsequent MRSA challenge. Influenza infection primes the lungs to be more susceptible to a subsequent bacterial infection, and our data suggest that antibiotic-induced eosinophilia further exacerbates the risks. This study defines a mechanism by which antibiotic use during influenza infection alters lung innate immunity and challenges the common clinical practice of prescribing antibiotics during influenza when there is no evidence of bacterial infection. Methods Animal experiments and sex as a biological variable. EoCre mice, transgenic mice previously characterized to express Cre recombinase in eosinophils, were provided by Elizabeth Jacobsen (Mayo Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona, USA) (59). The EoCre mice were crossed with ROSAmTmG transgenic mice (The Jackson Laboratory, strain 007676) to create transgenic mice that express GFP in eosinophils and tdTomato in all other cell types. For the 2-hit influenza-MRSA model, mice were fed water ad libitum, either control water containing sucrose (50 g/L) or an antibiotic cocktail containing vancomycin (0.5 g/L), neomycin (1 g/L), ampicillin (1 g/L), and metronidazole (1 g/L) (VNAM; MilliporeSigma) and sucrose (50 g/L), for 14 days (starting day –7 and ending day 7). Water bottles were changed twice a week. On day 0 (7 days after starting VNAM), animals were intranasally infected with mouse-adapted H1N1 influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) (250–500 PFU in 25 μL of PBS) under inhalation anesthesia (isoflurane, Piramal Critical Care Inc.). On day 7, all groups were switched to control water containing sucrose (50 g/L). Animals were infected with MRSA (strain USA300) or S. pneumoniae (serotype 19F) on day 10 by administration of 1 × 107 CFU per mouse or 1 × 106 CFU per mouse, respectively, in 40 μL of PBS intratracheally. Mice were sacrificed on the indicated days after PR8 infection for tissue collection. In some experiments, an additional treatment arm that included an antifungal drug with VNAM treatment in the drinking water was evaluated by addition of fluconazole (0.5 g/L) or amphotericin (0.1 g/L). Other studies added intraperitoneal injection of an isotype (100 μg/mouse; Bio X Cell, clone HRPN; BE0088) or anti–IL-5 antibody (100 μg/mouse; Bio X Cell, clone TRFK5; BE0198). All mice were on the C57BL/6 background and were used for experiments between the ages of 8 and 12 weeks. In the 2-hit experiments, pilot experiments identified a similar phenotype in both male and female mice. Although no significant difference was identified in the effect between sexes, most of the subsequent studies were performed predominantly in female mice to reduce variability. For experiments in which eosinophils were isolated from transgenic mice, both male and female mice were used. Human studies. The Research Informatics and Scientific Computing Core at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) through the Honest Enterprise Research Broker committee provided clinical data from patients admitted for influenza infection in 2019. Deidentified data were provided by investigators at Northwestern University through an established data use agreement. Deidentified samples and associated metadata were provided by investigators at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center through a material transfer agreement. Cohort 1 included clinical data collected from all patients admitted in 2019 to CSMC with the diagnosis of influenza infection. The eosinophil level at admission and the last measured value prior to discharge were evaluated in those that were treated with antibiotics for more than 4 days during the hospitalization. Furthermore, the mean eosinophil level of all measurements during the hospitalization was correlated with the hospital LOS. Cohort 2 examined the pattern of serum absolute eosinophils and BAL percentage eosinophils using deidentified data from the SCRIPT study, a single-site prospective cohort study of patients hospitalized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital ICU who required mechanical ventilation and underwent a BAL for suspected pneumonia (17, 60). We used a day-by-day map prepared for the CarpeDiem project (60). If a patient had multiple eosinophil values measured on one day, the mean value for that day was used for analysis. We removed patients who had received steroids during their ICU course, leaving a cohort of 200 patients who underwent 345 BALs during 2,487 ICU days. For patients with multiple ICU stays, we took data only from their first ICU stay for analysis. Cohort 3 used deidentified plasma (n = 120) and metadata from ICU patients on mechanical ventilation at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (61). Plasma from ICU patients was diluted 1:25 in PBS, and duplicate measurements of EPX were determined with the Human Eosinophil Peroxidase (EPX) ELISA kit (MyBioSource, MBS2024555) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Host-response plasma biomarkers from this patient cohort were measured with a custom-made Luminex panel (R&D Systems) as previously described (61). Bronchoalveolar lavage. BAL fluid from mice was collected by cannulation of the trachea with an 18-gauge angiocath (BD, 381134) with the lungs in situ followed by instillation of 1 mL of sterile PBS and immediate suctioning to maximally recover the instillate. The instillation and recovery process were repeated 2 more times (total 3 mL). The BAL fluid was counted with an automated cell counter (Bio-Rad Laboratories, TC20) and centrifuged (1,500 rpm [277g] for 10 minutes). The supernatant was separated from the cell pellet and frozen at –80°C until use. The cell pellet was immunostained for flow cytometry analysis to quantify immune subpopulations. Lung cell dissociation. Mouse lungs were placed in a Petri dish and washed with PBS to remove remaining blood. Cells were dissociated using the Lung Dissociation Kit, mouse (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-095-927), in conjunction with gentleMACS Dissociators (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 300g at 4°C for 10 minutes, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 3 mL of RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience, 00-4333-57). After 1 minute at room temperature, 10 mL of PBS was added to neutralize the RBC lysis buffer and centrifuged at 300g at 4°C for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was washed one more time with 10 mL of PBS. The cells were resuspended in cold flow buffer (PBS plus 5% FBS), counted, and processed for flow cytometry. Flow cytometry. Single-cell suspensions were stained with a mixture of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (1:100 dilution) for 30 minutes at 4°C. After incubation, cells were washed with flow buffer (PBS plus 5% FBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 minutes at room temperature), washed, and stored in flow buffer until flow cytometry analysis. Data were acquired by a BD LSRFortessa Cell analyzer and analyzed with FlowJo version 9 (BD). Flow antibodies are listed in Supplemental Table 7. Protein assays. Total protein in mouse BAL fluid was measured by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225), and ELISAs for murine IFN-γ (R&D Systems, DY485-05), IL-1β (R&D Systems, DY401-05), and PRG2 (MBP-1; MyBioSource, MBS2022666) were performed per manufacturer’s protocol. Immunofluorescent assays. Murine lungs were inflated with 10% neutral formalin and then placed in 70% alcohol after 24 hours. Tissues were processed for paraffin embedding, and then formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were cut into 7-μm-thick sections. Slides underwent 1× citrate buffer antigen retrieval and permeabilization with 10% methanol and 0.4 H2O2 and were blocked with 5% BSA. Lung sections were stained with anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:100; Rockland, 600-401-215) followed by donkey anti-rabbit–Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:500; BioLegend, 406416) and DAPI counterstain (1:500; Invitrogen, D1306). Human lungs were received from the Department of Pathology at CSMC. FFPE tissues were cut into 10-μm-thick sections and processed for immunostaining for MBP-1 (PRG2) as above using a rabbit anti-PRG2 antibody (1:500; Invitrogen, PA5-102628) followed by donkey anti-rabbit–Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:500; BioLegend, 406416) and DAPI counterstain (1:500; Invitrogen, D1306). All immunofluorescence images were obtained with a Nikon Ti2 microscope. Eosinophil isolation and conditioned medium collection. Bone marrow cells were collected from the femora of wild-type EoCre-mTmG transgenic mice. Femora were isolated, and both ends of bones were cut off. The shaft of the femur with the patellar end downward was then placed into a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with a small hole on the bottom that was nested in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. The bones were centrifuged at 18,000g for 30 seconds. The supernatant was decanted, and the bone marrow pellet was resuspended in 500 μL of PBS and transferred to a 15 mL conical vial. The bone marrow suspension was centrifuged at 300g at 4°C for 8 minutes. Afterward, the supernatant was aspirated, and the bone marrow pellet was resuspended in 500 μL of RBC lysis buffer. After 1 minute at room temperature, 10 mL of PBS was added to neutralize the RBC lysis buffer. The bone marrow suspension was centrifuged at 300g at 4°C for 8 minutes and, after removal of the supernatant, was resuspended in 200 μL of chilled sorting buffer (0.5 M EDTA, 2% BSA in HBSS). Eosinophils were isolated with a BD Influx System by sorting for GFP+, RFP– cells (Supplemental Figure 13). Purified eosinophils were centrifuged at 400g for 5 minutes at 4°C and resuspended in IMDM plus 10% FBS without antibiotic at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells per 250 μL. Eosinophils were either immediately used for bacterial killing assays or cultured at 37°C for 24 hours to collect the conditioned medium, which was frozen at –80°C until required for further experiments. Bacterial culture. Frozen bacterial stock (MRSA, USA 300) was directly scraped with an inoculation loop, added to 3–4 mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB; VWR, 470177-386) in a 15 mL tube, and incubated overnight at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. After an overnight incubation, the bacterial culture was diluted 1:25 in a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One, 655180) and quantitated by measurement of the amount of absorbance at 550 nm. MRSA was diluted in 3 mL of TSB and subcultured for 2 hours and 45 minutes with shaking at 200 rpm at 37°C to reach the middle of exponential growth. The subculture was then diluted 1:5 in TSB and quantified by measurement of the amount of absorbance at 550 nm. The amount of MRSA used in subsequent assays was washed twice with PBS and resuspended in PBS at the appropriate concentration. S. pneumoniae were similarly grown but in Brain Heart Infusion Broth medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R060270) and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2. Bacterial colony-forming units. To determine CFU of bacteria, 100 μL of conditioned medium from in vitro bacterial killing assay or lung homogenates (100 mg/mL in PBS) was used as a starting point. Serial 1:10 dilutions were then created with PBS for a total of 4 concentrations including the original stock. An agar plate containing 5% sheep blood (BD Trypticase Soy Agar II, BD Biosciences 221261) had 4 quadrants demarcated on the plate, and 10 μL of each dilution was streaked out in respective quadrants using sterile loops (Celltreat/Fisher, 229612). Blood agar plates were incubated at 37°C until individual colonies were clearly visible. Fiji software (ImageJ2 version 2.14.0/1.54F) was used to count the CFU as follows. Individual JPEG images of each quadrant were converted to 16 bit and had the threshold adjusted to highlight distinct colonies while eliminating background noise. A watershed function was used to separate individual colonies that may have overlapping borders after thresholding (Process → Binary → Watershed). Subsequently, individual colonies could be counted using the analyze particle function (Analyze → Analyze Particle). In vitro bacterial killing assay and phagocytosis assay. RAW 264.7 cells (ATCC, TIB-71) were plated in a 48-well plate at 5 × 104 cells per well in 250 μL of DMEM (Corning, 10-013-CV) or IMDM (Gibco, 31980030) plus 10% FBS (Cytiva, 16777-014) without antibiotic and incubated at 37°C. The next day, RAW 264.7 cells were washed, and MRSA (200 CFU in 250 μL of DMEM 10% FBS) was added. In some conditions, 5 × 104 eosinophils were added to the culture. Alternatively, 250 μL of conditioned medium from eosinophil cultures was used. All conditions were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 4 hours, at which point conditioned medium was collected and placed on ice for immediate determination of CFU. In parallel experiments, RAW 264.7 cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2, and either BSA (1 μg/mL; control) or recombinant MBP-1 (1 μg/mL; Cedarlane, RPB650MU02-2) was added for 2 hours before CFU determination. RAW 264.7 cells (104 cells per well) were cultured in 96-well plates for 48 hours before addition of pHrodo Red S. aureus bioparticles (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10010). Phagocytosis was evaluated by real-time immunofluorescent imaging of wells cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 (Incucyte Sartorius). Some conditions had addition of BSA (1 μg/mL) or recombinant MBP-1 (1 μg/mL) or were replaced with eosinophil conditioned medium. Every hour, images of the whole well were captured using a ×4 objective lens with a 400-millisecond acquisition time for the red channel. Images underwent phase contrast masking to distinguish cells from the background during analysis. Red channel background noise was minimized using top-hat segmentation with a 100 μm radius, and a threshold of 1 or 2 was applied for the red channel. The internalization of bioparticles or heat-killed MRSA was measured using a mask for red-positive cells. Phagocytosis was quantified using total red fluorescence intensity normalized by confluence and intensity at time 0. For in vivo phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages, pHrodo Red S. aureus bioparticles were diluted in sterile PBS (1 part bioparticle and 4 parts PBS). Additionally, BSA or recombinant MBP-1 was added to the solution to make a final concentration of 1 μg/mL. Mice had 50 μL of the solution intranasally instilled into the lungs. After 1 hour, cells were lavaged from the lungs, and phagocytosis was determined by the percentage of alveolar macrophages (CD45+, CD11c+, Siglec-F+) that acquired pHrodo signal by flow cytometry (Supplemental Figure 14). Precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) cultures were prepared from unchallenged euthanized mice. The lungs were inflated with 1 mL of 2% low-melting-point agarose solution heated at 37°C. The inflated lungs were embedded in low-melting-point agarose, allowed to solidify on ice, and then sectioned into 300-μm-thick slices using a vibratome. The lung slices were placed into 12-well plates containing prewarmed DMEM-F12 medium without phenol red and cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 hours. The next day, the agarose was removed from each PCLS by washing once with PBS. Subsequently, 300 μL of DMEM without antibiotics supplemented with 1 μg/mL of recombinant MBP-1 or BSA was added. Additionally, pHrodo Red S. aureus bioparticles (1:10 final dilution) were added to all conditions. After a 24-hour culture, the PCLS was washed once with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature. After another wash, the slices were placed on slides, mounted with mounting medium, and then stored at 4°C. Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope, and number of red fluorescent particles was quantified per each ×10 field. Multiple random fields were imaged and averaged together for the phagocytosis measurement. Single-cell RNA-Seq and data processing. Lungs were isolated and single-cell suspensions were processed for scRNA-Seq as previously described (62). In brief, control (n = 4) and VNAM-treated (n = 4) mice were sacrificed at day 10 after PR8 infection, and lungs were removed and enzymatically digested with elastase and lipase/DNase. Cell suspensions were processed for single-cell capture and library preparation (10x Genomics Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits) and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. CellRanger v7.0.0 software (10x Genomics) was used with the default settings for demultiplexing, aligning reads with STAR software (10x Genomics), and counting unique molecular identifiers. Cell hashing data were demultiplexed using the CellRanger default setting. The single-cell analysis R package Seurat v5 was used for further data analysis (63). For quality control and filtering out of low-quality cells, only cells expressing more than 500 genes (defined as genes detected in at least 3 cells) and fewer than 10% mitochondrial genes were selected. To minimize doublet contamination, doublets were removed using DoubletFinder (64), and doublet ratio was estimated using a fit model generated from the suggested “multiplet rate”/“number of cells recovered” ratio, as stated in the 10x Genomics user manual (65). We used default normalization and data scaling procedures from the Seurat package, which involve log normalization and linear model for data scaling. For data integration, we used the batch correction package Harmony (66). Principal component analysis was performed using the 3,000 most variable genes, and the first 30 independent components were used for downstream unbiased clustering with a resolution of 0.6. The uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) method was used for unsupervised clustering visualization. The cell cluster identities were determined using known gene markers of lung cell types (67). To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different clusters and groups, we used the default differential expression testing based on the nonparametric Wilcoxon’s rank sum test by Seurat. Genes with adjusted P less than 0.01 were input into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; QIAGEN) to evaluate regulatory pathways. RNA-Seq and data processing. RAW 264.7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well in 500 μL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated at 37°C. The next day, RAW 264.7 cells were rinsed once with PBS, and 500 μL of eosinophil conditioned medium or control epithelial conditioned medium (MLE-15 cells cultured at 5 × 104 cells per 250 μL for 24 hours) was added. In parallel experiments, RAW 264.7 cells were incubated in eosinophil conditioned medium with the addition of an isotype antibody (2 μg/mL; BioLegend, Poly29018) or anti–MBP-1 antibody (2 μg/mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific, PA5-102628). After 24 hours of culture, cells were lysed for RNA extraction using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 74104), and the extracted RNA was stored at –80°C before RNA sequencing with NovaSeq 6000. Raw reads were aligned with STAR aligner 2.7.1 (68) with default parameters, using a mouse mm10 reference genome downloaded from iGenomes (https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html). Raw counts were generated with featureCounts 2.0.3 (10x Genomics). DEGs were generated using DESeq2 2.11.40.8 (10x Genomics) with raw counts. These processes were performed using Galaxy server (usegalaxy.org). A normalized transcripts per million (TPM) file was generated using the R package. DEGs were input into IPA, and genes with an adjusted P less than 0.01 were used for Disease and Function Analysis. Stool DNA isolation, microbiome sequencing, and analysis. DNA was extracted from mouse stool using a modified QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 51306). Stool was mixed with lysis buffer and homogenized with 0.1 mm and 0.5 mm glass beads (Biospec, 11079101z and 11079105z, respectively) using a bead beater at high speed for 1 minute. Tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes, and the supernatant was decanted. Stool was resuspended in 500 μL stool DNA stabilizer (B Bridge International, 1038111100) and homogenized with glass beads using a bead beater at high speed for 1 minute. Tubes were then heated at 95°C for 5 minutes, subjected to a bead beater again for 1 minute, heated at 95°C for 5 minutes, then vortexed for 5 seconds. Next, 300 μL Buffer AL (Qiagen, 51306) and 22 μL proteinase K were added, vortexed for 30 seconds, and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes. Subsequently, 600 μL phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added, and the tubes were subjected to a bead beater for 30 seconds. Tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 16,000g, and the upper aqueous phase was removed and transferred to a new tube to which 700 μL of ethanol was added and mixed. Solution was added to QIAamp collection tubes, and the kit protocol for DNA extraction was followed. Stool bacteria burden and fungus burden were measured by PCR quantification using 16S primers (forward: ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT; reverse: ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGC) and FungiQuant (69) primers (forward: GGRAAACTCACCAGGTCCAG; reverse: GSWCTATCCCCAKCACGA), respectively. Stool was collected from mice subjected to the 2-hit injury at days –7, 0, 10, and 12 to evaluate changes in α- and β-diversity. ITS sequencing was repeated for stool collected at day 10 to evaluate changes in the relative abundance at the family and genus level. Bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS rRNA gene amplicons were generated using high-fidelity Platinum SuperFi Polymerase (Life Technologies). The following primers were used (underlined regions indicate the Illumina adapter sequence and boldface regions indicate the primer sequence): (a) bacterial 16S rRNA primers 8F (TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGAGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG) and R357 (GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCTGCTGCCTYCCGTA) with annealing temperature 48°C and 25 PCR cycles; (b) fungal ITS rRNA primers ITS1f (TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS2 (GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC) with annealing temperature 48°C and 35 PCR cycles. PCR reactions were purified using the ZR-96 DNA Clean-up Kit (Zymo Research). Amplicons were qualified on the 4200 TapeStation using the Agilent D1000 ScreenTape System (Agilent Technologies). Amplicons from up to 384 samples were uniquely indexed in a PCR reaction using Nextera XT Index Kit v2 Sets A–D (Illumina) and KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche). Library enrichment was performed using 8 cycles of PCR. Multiplexed samples were pooled at equal volume by library type. The pooled libraries were purified using HighPrep PCR Magnetic Beads (MagBio Genomics) and subsequently assayed on a 4200 TapeStation to check final sizing. Samples were sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) with paired-end 300 bp sequencing chemistry. Raw data processing and run demultiplexing were performed using on-instrument analytics per manufacturer recommendations. 16S (V1–V2 region) and ITS1 sequencing of mouse stool samples was performed as previously described (70). Statistics. All experiments had a minimum of 3 independent biological replicates performed. Technical replicates were averaged to represent 1 independent sample. Statistical analysis (2-sided) and figure generation were performed with Prism version 10 (GraphPad Software). Statistical tests are listed within the corresponding figure legends. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Study approval. All animal experiments were approved by the IACUC (IACUC009018) at CSMC. Data collected from patients admitted for influenza infection at CSMC were approved by the Institutional Review Board (STUDY00000219). Data from Northwestern University and samples collected at the University of Pittsburgh were approved by the IRB at their respective institutions, and all data and samples sent to CSMC were deidentified. Data availability. The scRNA-Seq data can be obtained from the NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE243542). RNA-Seq data can be obtained from the GEO database (GSE259429).

More info Healthcare professionals Healthcare professionals Contact us Contact us Home Media Press release archive GSK announces positive headline data ... 12 September 2024 Issued: London, UK For media and investors only GSK announces positive headline data from phase II seasonal influenza mRNA vaccine programme Download (PDF, 128.7KB) A vaccine candidate formulation demonstrated positive A and B strain immune responses relative to standard of care in both younger and older adults mRNA platform elicits strong overall antibody titres with an acceptable safety profile Data support progression to phase III clinical trials GSK plc (LSE/NYSE: GSK) today announced positive headline results of a phase II trial (NCT06431607) for its mRNA seasonal influenza vaccine programme. The trial studied a range of mRNA formulations in older and younger adults to evaluate vaccine candidates that could improve immune responses against influenza A and B strains, compared to the current standard of care. In both younger and older adults, pre-defined success criteria were met. Interim data suggest the vaccine candidates have an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile for all mRNA formulations tested. These results build on the previous phase II trial and confirm the mRNA platform elicits strong overall antibody titres with an acceptable safety profile. With these results, the GSK mRNA seasonal influenza vaccine programme will progress into late-stage clinical development. GSK’s Chief Scientific Officer, Tony Wood said: “This marks a significant advancement in our mRNA programme and these data support moving into late-stage development. Ultimately, our goal is to develop a new best-in-class vaccine to bring greater protection to people through the influenza season.” GSK recently signed a new licensing agreement with CureVac to assume full control of developing and manufacturing influenza and COVID-19 candidate vaccines. GSK continues to develop and optimise its mRNA capabilities through investments and partnerships, including in AI/ML-based sequence optimisation, nanoparticle design and manufacturing. About study NCT06431607 The phase II study assesses the reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity of different dose levels of a modified, multivalent vaccine candidate, encoding antigens matched to all three WHO-recommended influenza strains. The study includes 250 healthy younger adults aged 18 to 64 and 250 healthy older adults aged 65 to 85. In each age group, different dose levels were tested in comparison to an age-appropriate, licensed comparator vaccine. https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06431607 About GSK GSK is a global biopharma company with a purpose to unite science, technology, and talent to get ahead of disease together.

This secondary analysis of data from a test-negative study of outpatients with acute respiratory illness assessed BMI and VE against medically attended, PCR-confirmed influenza over seven seasons (2011–12 through 2017–18). Vaccination status was determined from electronic medical records (EMR) and self-report; BMI was estimated from EMR-documented height and weight categorized for adults as obesity (≥ 30 kg/m2), overweight (25–29 kg/m2), or normal and for children based on standardized z-scales. Current season VE by virus type/subtype was estimated separately for adults and children. Pooled VE for all seasons was calculated as 1—adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression with an interaction term for BMI and vaccination. Among 28,089 adults and 12,380 children, BMI category was not significantly associated with VE against outpatient influenza for any type/subtype. Adjusted VE against A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, and B in adults ranged from 16–31, 46–54, and 44–57%, and in children from 29–34, 57–65, and 50–55%, respectively, across the BMI categories. Elevated BMI was not associated with reduced VE against laboratory confirmed, outpatient influenza illness.

The worldwide prevalence of obesity more than doubled between 1990 and 20221. In the United States, obesity affects over 40% of adults and nearly 20% of children2,3. Obesity is associated with metabolic syndrome and other comorbid conditions, and it may contribute to more severe influenza illness in children and adults4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.The effects of obesity on the immune response to influenza vaccination are complex and poorly understood. Post-vaccination hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers to influenza antigens are largely similar in individuals with obesity and normal weight12,13,14. However, antibody titers appear to decline more rapidly in people with higher body mass index (BMI), and aspects of the cell-mediated immune response may be inhibited13,15,16,17.The relationship between BMI and clinical vaccine effectiveness (VE) is even less clear as few studies have addressed this question. A prospective observational study reported similar protection against PCR-confirmed influenza illness in vaccinated children with and without obesity18. While there are no published VE estimates comparing adults with and without obesity, a two-season prospective study in vaccinated adults found that influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) was associated with obesity despite similar levels of seroprotective antibodies19. However, the study was limited by a small sample size, nonspecific endpoint (ILI), likely residual confounding, and lack of an unvaccinated comparison group.To further elucidate the relationship between obesity and influenza VE in the outpatient setting, we analyzed data from the US influenza (Flu) VE network over seven seasons.MethodsThis analysis included data from the Flu VE Network from 2011–12 through 2017–1820. Details of the study population and procedures have been previously described21,22. In brief, patients seeking medical care for an acute respiratory illness (ARI) with cough and illness of ≤ 7 days duration were recruited from outpatient, urgent care, and emergency department facilities in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. The institutional review boards (IRB) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and all participating sites (Marshfield Clinic Health System IRB, Group Health Cooperative Human Subjects Review Committee/Kaiser Permanente-Washington Region IRB, Baylor Scott & White Research Institute IRB, University of Michigan IRBMED, and University of Pittsburgh Human Research Protection Office) approved the study. The study was performed in accordance with Health and Human Services regulations for the protection of human subjects in research (specifically 45 CFR 46, 21 CFR 50, and 21 CFR 56). Participants/legal guardians provided informed consent prior to participating. Consenting participants/legal guardians completed an enrollment interview to ascertain demographics, symptoms, onset date, current season vaccination, and subjective assessments of general and current health status. Anterior or mid-turbinate nasal and throat swabs were collected from participants by research staff and tested for influenza type and subtype by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at network sites. Presence of underlying medical conditions was defined as one or more International Classification of Diseases, Ninth/Tenth Revision (ICD-9/10) codes diagnosed for medical encounters in the previous year.Influenza vaccination statusParticipants with electronic medical record (EMR) documented vaccine receipt of ≥ 1 dose of current season influenza vaccine or undocumented but plausible self- or parent-reported vaccination 14 or more days before symptom onset were classified as vaccinated. Plausible self-report was determined by sites as receipt of vaccination during times influenza vaccination is typically offered and from providers (e.g. Veterans Affairs, Indian Health Service) not routinely reported to immunization information systems. Participants vaccinated < 14 days before onset were excluded from analysis.Body mass index (BMI)Height and weight measurements closest in time to enrollment were extracted from EMR. BMI in adults was grouped into categories according to National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) definitions: < 18.5 kg/m2 (underweight), 18.5 to < 25 kg/m2 (normal, reference category), 25 to < 30 kg/m2 (overweight), and ≥ 30 kg/m2 (obesity)23,24. For children and adolescents, the publicly available SAS Program for the 2000 CDC Growth Charts was used to calculate BMI category for children 24 months (2 years) to 17 years of age based on percentile ranges for BMI by age and sex, with < 5th percentile, underweight, 5 to < 85th percentile, normal (reference category), 85 to < 95th percentile, overweight and ≥ 95th percentile, obesity25,26.Height and weight data were only included if within plausible ranges. For adults ≥ 18 years of age, height ≥ 44 inches and ≤ 90 inches, weight ≥ 55 pounds and ≤ 1000 pounds, and BMI ≥ 12 and ≤ 70 were considered plausible27. For children, plausible values for height, weight, and BMI were defined by z scores calculated from the percentile of weight-, height- and BMI-for-age (in months) scores of the child25. We excluded pregnant women, underweight individuals, adults with weight measurements obtained more than 12 months from enrollment date, and children with height or weight measurements more than 6 months from enrollment date. Analyses were restricted to children aged ≥ 24 months.Analytic approachInfluenza cases were persons with rRT-PCR positive tests for influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, or B viruses. Participants with unsubtypable influenza A or inconclusive results or with co-infections with multiple influenza viruses were excluded. Controls were persons testing rRT-PCR negative for all influenza subtypesypes. The analysis period was defined at each site, for each season, and for each type/subtype. The period was determined as the calendar week of enrollment from the first rRT-PCR positive influenza case of the specific type/subtype at that site through the last confirmed case of that type/subtype at that site. Seasons with 50 or more virus type/subtype specific cases were pooled; sites with 10 or more virus type/subtype specific cases were included in pooled analyses for the respective seasons and type/subtype.We generated multivariable logistic regression models with influenza case status as the outcome. VE was estimated as (1-aOR) × 100, where aOR is the adjusted odds ratio for influenza among vaccinated compared with unvaccinated persons28,29. Vaccination status, age, network site, and enrollment season, were included in all adjusted models a priori. Age was modeled as a linear tail-restricted natural cubic spline for adults and as categories (2–8 years and 9–17 years) for children and adolescents. The pediatric age cut off was selected for consistency with influenza vaccine recommendations30. Records with missing data for influenza result, BMI, or model covariates were not included in the final analyses. Additional covariates were evaluated and retained in the model if the coefficient for the vaccination status differed by ≥ 10%. Covariates examined included: calendar time relative to the season peak at each site and type/subtype; time from illness onset to enrollment; presence of ≥ 1 underlying medical condition other than obesity; sex; self-reported health status; race/ethnicity; and smoking status (in adults only). We evaluated modification of VE by participant BMI by including an interaction term in models. Evidence of interaction was defined a priori at p < 0.10. Separate models were generated for children and adults, and A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, and type B associated illness.We used models restricted to vaccinated participants, with odds of influenza as the outcome and BMI as the exposure, to assess differential odds of breakthrough illness among vaccinated participants with obesity versus those with normal BMI as the reference group. Time from vaccination to illness onset (< 90 days vs ≥ 90 days) was included as a covariate in addition to the other a priori covariates to account for waning vaccine effects.Sensitivity analysesFor A/H3N2, the 2014–15 season was excluded in sensitivity analyses because circulating A/H3N2 viruses were not antigenically matched to the vaccine virus. Among adults, a BMI of ≥ 40 (class 3 obesity) is currently used to define individuals at increased risk for severe outcomes from influenza so we performed an additional sensitivity analysis creating a four level BMI term by dividing the obesity category into obesity (30 to < 40) and class 3 obesity (BMI ≥ 40). To assess potential differences among older adults, sensitivity analyses were restricted to adults ≥ 65 years of age.ResultsFrom 2011–12 through 2017–18, 31 647 adults were enrolled in the Flu VE Network, of whom 28 089 were included in this analysis (Supplemental Fig. 1). Among eligible adults, 6 259 (22%) had a normal weight BMI, 8 338 (30%) had an overweight BMI, and 13 492 (48%) had an obese BMI (Table 1). Among those with obese BMI, 25% (12% of adults overall) would be considered class 3 obesity with a BMI ≥ 40. Most participants were non-Hispanic White (80%), 26% had an underlying medical condition other than obesity, and 54% were vaccinated with 37% of those receiving vaccine less than 90 days prior to illness onset. 9% of vaccination dates were determined from self-report (data not shown). Compared to individuals of normal weight, a greater percentage of participants with obesity were non-Hispanic Black, or Hispanic, had an underlying medical condition, and had received the current season influenza vaccine. A higher percentage of adult participants with BMI in normal ranges reported excellent/very good general health compared to individuals with BMI in the obesity range. Table 1 Characteristics of adults categorized by body mass index, 2011–12 through 2017–18.Full size tableCompared to non-influenza controls, among adult participants lower percentages of influenza case participants had BMI in the obese range, were male, less likely to rank their general health as poor to fair and to have received current season influenza vaccine (Table 2). Across all types/subtypes, controls were more likely to be enrolled later in illness (5–7 days from onset) compared to cases. Table 2 Characteristics of cases and controls by influenza type in adults, 2011–12 through 2017–18*.Full size tableFrom 2011–12 through 2017–18, 16 636 children were enrolled in the Flu VE Network, of whom 12 380 were included in this analysis (Supplemental Fig. 1). Among eligible children 7 860 (63%) had a normal range BMI, 2 018 (16%) had an overweight range BMI, and 2 502 (20%) had an obese range BMI. Most were non-hispanic white (64%), 4% had an underlying medical condition other than obesity in the previous year, 45% were vaccinated, 18% of vaccinated children received live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and 41% of vaccinated children received vaccine less than 90 days prior to illness onset (Table 3). Less than 1% of vaccination dates were determined from self-report (data not shown). Children with obese range BMI were more frequently enrolled from the Texas site, non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic, female, and 9–17 years of age compared with children of normal weight and overweight range. Children with obesity were more likely to have an underlying medical condition and less likely to report excellent or very good health status or be vaccinated compared to children with normal weight and children with overweight BMI. There were multiple demographic and clinical differences between pediatric influenza cases and controls (Table 4). Across all influenza types, controls were more likely to be vaccinated.

Results were similar in a sensitivity analysis that excluded adults with vaccination based on self-report. In children and adolescents, VE estimates by influenza virus type/subtype and BMI category varied from 29% (95% CI 7, 45%) to 34% (95% CI 13, 50%) against A/H3N2, from 57% (95% CI 19, 77%) to 65% (31, 83%), against A/H1N1pdm09, and from 50% (95% CI 29, 65%) to 55% (37, 68%) against type B. (Fig. 1). Results were similar in a sensitivity analysis that excluded children < 9 years old who were partially vaccinated. VE in children was also similar across BMI categories in a sensitivity analysis that excluded LAIV recipients. Interaction terms for modification of VE by BMI category were not statistically significant (p > 0. 10) for adults or children.Fig. 1Adjusted vaccine effectiveness against medically attended influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, and B by BMI category in adults and children/adolescents in the US Flu VE Network, 2011–12 through 2017–18. BMI body mass index, OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval, aVE adjusted vaccine effectiveness. *BMI categories: Adults: Normal (18.5 to < 25 kg/m2), Overweight (25 to < 30 kg/m2), Obesity (≥ 30 kg/m2); Children/adolescents: Normal (BMI percent 5 to < 85), Overweight (BMI percent 85 to < 95), Obesity (BMI percent ≥ 95). †Adjusted vaccine effectiveness—calculated as 100*(1—adjusted odds ratio). Adjusted odds ratio of vaccination status—Adjusted for site, season, age (as spline in adults; as category (2– < 9 years, 9–17 years) in children), BMI, and interaction of BMI and vaccination status.Full size imageWhen the 2014–15 season was excluded for A/H3N2, there was evidence that BMI category modified VE among adults (interaction p = 0.06). Compared to the main analysis, among both adults and children, A/H3N2 VE estimates increased for all BMI categories, and the trend was the same with the highest VE among adults in the overweight category, and among children in the normal category. (Supplemental Table 1, 2). Among adults, there was evidence that BMI category may modify VE against A/H3N2 when class 3 obesity is categorized separately from obesity (interaction p = 0.09), but the VE point estimates do not indicate a consistent trend of increased risk for higher BMI. Across all flu types/subtypes, the VE trends observed for distinct obesity and class 3 obesity categories had wide confidence intervals and were generally similar to the results presented in the main findings (Supplemental Table 1). VE estimates across all types/subtypes decreased when restricting the adult population to ≥ 65 years of age. None of the estimates for A/H3N2 remained statistically significant, but VE among older adults with BMI in the overweight and obesity categories were significant for A/H1N1pdm09 and B (Supplemental Table 1).Among vaccinated adults, the adjusted odds of laboratory-confirmed influenza for all types/subtypes were significantly lower in participants with obesity vs normal weight (Table 5). Significantly lower odds of influenza among participants with obesity remained when excluding participants with plausible self-reported vaccination. Among vaccinated children, odds of infection with A/H3N2 were significantly lower among children with obesity compared to children with normal weight, but odds of infection with A/H1N1pdm09 or type B did not differ by BMI category (Table 5). The significantly lower odds of infection with A/H3N2 remained among children with obesity when excluding partially vaccinated children < 9 years of age and LAIV recipients. Table 5 Association between obesity and laboratory confirmed influenza illness in vaccine recipients, 2011–12 through 2017–18.Full size tableDiscussionIn this analysis over multiple seasons using consistent methods from a test-negative design study of influenza VE, participants with BMI categorized as overweight or obesity at the time of illness had similar VE against medically attended influenza compared to individuals with normal weight BMI. Findings were similar in adults and children, and across all three influenza types/subtypes (A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, and B). With high prevalence of obesity in the US population, even a modest reduction in VE due to obesity could have a substantial public health impact. The results from this analysis provide evidence that influenza vaccination remains effective at preventing medically attended influenza illness across a range of BMI.Obesity is often accompanied by metabolic syndrome and other comorbidities, and these conditions may contribute to immune dysregulation and increased severity of respiratory infections31. During the 2009 influenza A/H1N1pdm09 pandemic and the COVID-19 pandemic, obesity was associated with more severe illness 32,33. The mechanism is not well-understood, but increased production of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs may be important during acute infection34. Obesity can also influence the antibody response to vaccine antigens. Impaired vaccine response in individuals with obesity was first reported in 1985 with hepatitis B vaccination of health care workers35. Few studies have assessed influenza vaccine immunogenicity and obesity, and results have been inconsistent. During the 2009–10 season, the HI response to each of the vaccine antigens was similar in a convenience sample of individuals with obesity and normal weight15. However, individuals with obesity were more likely to have a fourfold reduction in HI titer by 12 months, suggesting more rapid waning. CD8 + T cell activation was also impaired in the participants with obesity. A more recent prospective cohort study in children and adolescents in 2019–20 found that pre- and post-vaccination geometric mean HI titers were similar in participants with obesity and normal weight36.In this study we did not assess vaccine immune response, but we observed reduced odds for laboratory-confirmed breakthrough influenza among vaccinated adults with obesity vs. those with normal weight. In vaccinated children, we observed a similar association for A/H3N2 but not for A/H1N1pdm09 or type B, which also remained with the exclusion of partially vaccinated children. The reduced odds of medically attended breakthrough influenza infection in adult vaccine recipients with obesity vs normal weight were statistically significant and ranged from 0.62 (for A/H1N1pdm09) to 0.83 (for A/H3N2). In contrast, other studies have reported elevated risk of influenza (or A/H1N1pdm09) in adults with obesity vs normal weight8,37. Given these previous findings and the accumulating evidence for obesity-related immune dysregulation, our finding was unexpected. This may be the result of residual confounding due to differences in health care seeking behaviors or differential risk of infection between individuals with obesity and normal weight. Individuals with obesity may have additional underlying medical conditions such as chronic respiratory conditions that we were unable to measure in this analysis. Higher body mass index has been associated with asthma and chronic cough38,39. Despite requiring acute cough of less than 7 days duration for enrollment, individuals with obesity may have enrolled more frequently with a cough without an infectious cause. Additionally, pre-existing respiratory conditions may increase the severity of influenza virus infection causing patients with obesity to bypass the outpatient settings from which we enrolled to seek higher levels of care.Strengths of this study include enrollment based on symptoms rather than infection status in multiple states over seven seasons, use of the test-negative design to minimize confounding due to health care seeking behavior, and separate analyses by influenza type/subtype in adults and children/adolescents. Two different sensitivity analyses yielded results that were consistent with the primary analysis. This study also has some limitations. We were unable to assess VE against influenza emergency department visits or hospitalization and other severe outcomes. Misclassification of BMI category may have occurred because height and weight were not measured during study enrollment. Instead, BMI categories were determined from height and weight variables in EMRs. Misclassification of vaccination status is possible since we included plausible self-report without documentation of vaccine receipt in EMR.In conclusion, this large multi-season study provides evidence that influenza vaccination reduces influenza illness and outpatient healthcare visits across a spectrum of BMI. Further research to assess the association between influenza vaccine effectiveness and obesity in the hospital setting may be beneficial since influenza related illness may be more severe in people with obesity. Our findings from the outpatient setting reinforce current recommendations for universal influenza vaccination in all adults and all children greater than 6 months of age, to protect against influenza and its complications.

By Texas A&M University Division of Marketing and Communications September 9, 2024 Share ShareTweet0 Shares The continued spread of avian influenza remains a cause for concern among health officials and the nation’s dairy producers, says Texas A&M University biosecurity expert Dr. Gerald Parker, though the threat to the average American remains low. Parker, who serves as associate dean for Global One Health at Texas A&M’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, will discuss this outbreak and other pressing public health issues during a panel discussion at the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday. He will be joined by Dr. Kiril Dimitrov, assistant director of the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, as well as two experts from the University of California, Davis. The talk will be moderated by Kevin Cain, senior director for governmental affairs with the American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges. Parker said 14 states and nearly 200 dairy herds are being impacted by the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian flu, first detected in dairy cows in March. While the spread of avian flu is generally confined to birds, only rarely spilling over to other animals or humans, he said this particular strain has shown an unusual ability to jump from birds to mammals. In addition to widespread transmission among dairy cow populations, the virus as also been detected in a few humans, including a farm worker in Texas this April. “So far, it hasn’t developed the characteristics for sustained human-to-human transmission. If that were to happen, it could be very worrisome,” Parker said, noting that public health officials have long been concerned about the pandemic potential of H5N1. “We don’t know if that’s going to happen, but the more it circulates in animals, mammals particularly, the more likely it is that it could happen.” For now, Parker said, the risk to the general public remains low. Those most at risk are the dairy workers and anyone who may have direct contact with infected herds. He said the dairy industry will need to work closely with health authorities to protect their animals and employees as well as the nation at large. “We have to be very vigilant about this,” Parker said. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported one case of avian flu in a human with no known contact with an infected animal. The H5N1 outbreak is one of several pressing public health issues on the table for Tuesday’s panel discussion. Parker plans to discuss additional steps Congress can take to curb the lingering threat of COVID-19, as well as new concerns surrounding Mpox, previously known as monkeypox. The talk will take place from noon to 1 p.m. Eastern time in the Rayburn House Office Building.

For example, he said that, of about 500 human swine flu cases identified since 2010, about 8% had no clear exposure to the virus.The probe hasn't turned up any evidence of human-to-human spread or any unusual rises in flu activity in Missouri, he added. “Evidence points to a one-off case,” Shah said.The concentration of virus RNA in the patient's sample was extremely low, and so far, CDC scientists haven't been able to piece together the full genome, which might yield clues about the source and flag any potential markers for increased risk of spread. So far, testing hasn't been able to pinpoint the neuraminidase, which is the "N" portion of H5N1.Though sequencing is still under way, results so far suggest that the virus is closely related to the one circulating in dairy cows, Shah said. "We're throwing everything we've got at this."We're throwing everything we've got at this.The patient had significant underlying medical conditions and was evaluated in the hospital for acute chest pain and gastrointestinal symptoms, he said. A respiratory panel was done during hospitalization, and as part of influenza surveillance the results were batched with other patient samples and sent to Missouri's state lab for subtyping. Shah commended Missouri and other states for stepping up their surveillance subtype testing over the summer months, which the CDC had recommended.Missouri investigators have found no link to consumption of raw milk or other raw dairy products, Shah said.CDC announces lab partnerships to speed up testingIn related developments, the federal government has lined up lab partnerships worth an initial $5 million with five companies to scale up testing capacity for flu, he said.The step is an unprecedented shift in working with the private sector and will allow the companies to develop the tests alongside CDC rather than after the fact, he said, emphasizing that the process with make testing available earlier and avoid delays during emergencies. In the past, tests from the private sector came online too late in the game, he said.The companies are Aegis Sciences, Arup Laboratories, Gingko Bioworks, Laboratory Corporation of America, and Quest Diagnostics. Shah said the partnerships also include work on Oropouche virus tests. He said establishing the "warm bases" with the companies isn't a prognostication, but rather a planning step that will eventually allow people to get tested in everyday settings.H5N1 turns up in more California herdsIn California's outbreaks, the virus is the same B3.13 genotype seen in other dairy cow outbreaks, but sequencing on more samples is under way, said Eric Deeble, DVM, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian flu at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).California has identified all of its outbreaks through enhanced surveillance in an area surrounding the first detections in the state's Central Valley. Today, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) added two more outbreaks from California to its confirmed list, putting the state’s total at eight.Initial analysis of the virus from the first three affected herds shows no evidence the California cows contracted the virus in a novel way, such as from wildlife or migrating birds.Deeble said the California Department of Food and Agriculture is working hard to track how the affected herds were exposed to H5N1. Since March, the USDA has confirmed H5N1 in 203 herds across 14 states.

Medscape Medical NewsFeaturesHuman Bird Flu Patient Had No Known Animal ContactHeidi Splete September 10, 2024 00A Missouri adult who tested positive for H5 bird flu had no known contact with animals but has underlying medical conditions, according to a statement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The case of avian influenza A (H5) was identified as part of Missouri's normal influenza surveillance testing program, which led to potential detection of the H5 subtype that was confirmed by the CDC, according to a press release from the Missouri State Department of Health and Senior Services. To ensure privacy, the state is not providing additional information on the patient other than that the individual has recovered and been discharged home. The state reports no increase in human influenza cases and no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including influenza-related emergency room visits, according to the press release.Although H5 occurs mainly in wild birds and poultry, it has been identified in other animals in the United States, including dairy cows.According to the Missouri press release, "No H5 infection in dairy cattle has been reported in Missouri; some H5 cases in commercial or backyard flocks and wild birds have been reported." The case represents the 14th reported occurrence of H5 in humans in the United States in 2024 but is the first without a known occupational exposure to sick or infected animals, and additional testing to characterize the virus is underway, according to the CDC. Identification of the N (neuraminidase) in the specimen from the patient is pending; H1N1 has been identified in wild birds in Missouri in the past, but the CDC currently assesses the risk of H5N1 to the general public as low, according to the statement. "The main concern in these situations is that no onward transmission is occurring. Findings from the ongoing investigation will inform whether guidance changes are needed," noted the statement.What This Means for CliniciansThis case is the 15th case of H5N1 avian influenza in humans reported in the United States since 2022, and the interest in the case stems from the absence of currently identified animal exposure, said David Cennimo, MD, associate professor of medicine and pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Disease at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, in an interview."All of the other human cases had links to sick birds or cows. We periodically see news of outbreaks in commercial chicken flocks, and there are warnings about infections in backyard chickens as well," Cennimo said. "Wild bird populations have been affected for years and are also being monitored," he said. The Missouri public health teams should be commended for their diligent surveillance and reporting as part of standard protocols, said Cennimo. "As of now, we have not been told of an obvious exposure," he said. If in fact the patient had no occupational exposure, they may recall a dead wild bird in their yard or have some exposure as yet unknown, he said. "An intriguing question has been raised about the possibility of unpasteurized milk transmitting the virus," Cennimo told Medscape. "However, there are no reports of H5N1 in Missouri cows, and we have no idea of the patient's dietary history. I am sure detailed investigations are underway, and I would stress there is no proof that milk is a vector for virus transmission, only a theoretical possibility," he emphasized. If patients have heard about the case and are expressing concern, the average person should be much more concerned about seasonal human influenza vs bird flu, especially if they are not vaccinated, Cennimo said. "The concern for H5N1 would be if we begin to see sustained human-to-human spread of the virus, but I would also point out to the worried well patient that the antivirals we have for influenza seem to be effective," he added.The patient's unknown underlying medical conditions could have increased the risk for severe influenza, and any exposure may never be known because it was too minor to be noticed, Cennimo noted. For clinicians, the ongoing message is to stress seasonal influenza vaccine for everyone eligible, Cennimo told Medscape. "Consider antiviral treatment for those in whom it is recommended," he said. In addition, "Think about the possibility of animal, especially bird, exposure. If there is concern for avian influenza, notify your health department and arrange for testing," he said. "If you do send influenza testing and it returns positive for influenza A but not confirmed H1 or H3, the sample should be further evaluated," Cennimo said.

The Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Iowa State University tests samples from animals for viruses such as avian influenza (Photo courtesy of Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory). WASHINGTON — Public health officials are still trying to determine how a Missouri resident contracted bird flu without having any contact with infected animals, but said Thursday there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission taking place in small enclaves or in a more widespread manner. The Missouri case marked the 14th person to contract highly pathogenic avian influenza, or H5N1, this year amid ongoing outbreaks among poultry and dairy cattle, though it marks the first time someone without contact to those animals was diagnosed with the virus. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on a call with reporters the “evidence points to this being a one-off case, and those do happen with novel influenza.” “Thus far, we have not seen any evidence of unusual levels of influenza activity in the area where this individual resides,” Shah said during the hour-long briefing. “There have been no increases in the volume of visits to emergency departments for influenza and no increase in laboratory detections of influenza cases in Missouri more broadly.” The state’s public health laboratory, he said, is subtyping all positive cases of Influenza A, following the CDC recommending ongoing detailed surveillance this spring. The practice is how doctors and public health officials confirmed this case and would likely be how they diagnose any uptick in cases in the future in the “overwhelming” number states that are taking the extra step of subtyping, he said. There are several types of influenza virus that are classified by the letters A, B, C and D. The viruses within the influenza A category are further categorized or subtyped based on the proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are at least 130 combinations of subtypes within Influenza A, according to the CDC. “So here’s the bottom line, our influenza surveillance system is designed to find needles in haystacks,” Shah said. “And as this case and others show, it is working. And here, in this case, we found such a needle, but we don’t know how it got there.” The Missouri patient, who has significant underlying medical conditions, was admitted to a hospital on Aug. 22 after presenting to health care providers with “acute symptoms of chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and weakness,” according to the CDC. The patient is not being identified out of privacy concerns. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services announced the diagnosis on Sept. 4, as did the CDC in a separate statement. Missouri DHSS noted the patient had recovered and been sent home from the hospital, while the CDC pointed out that the state has reported cases of H5N1 in commercial and backyard poultry flocks this year. The patient hadn’t been in contact with any livestock or poultry and didn’t indicate in a detailed questionnaire that they had consumed any food products, like raw milk, that could have potentially transmitted the virus. Shah said on the call that public health officials are technically classifying this as a case of H5 and not H5N1 as they work to sequence the virus more fully, though that might not be possible. The CDC has begun classifying the virus’ genetic sequence, but since the patient’s viral RNA levels were “extremely low” the agency may not be “able to generate a full flu genome, including the neuraminidase or the N part of the virus,” he said. “We’re throwing everything we’ve got at this, but ultimately a full sequence may not be technically feasible because of the low concentration of viral RNA,” Shah said. “The data that we do have and that have been generated thus far show an H5 virus that is closely related to the (H5N1) virus circulating among dairy cows.” The CDC, he said, is “continuing to look for evidence of genetic changes that would suggest, for example, an increased potential for spread.” None have yet been found. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at CDC, said the risk to the general public from bird flu remains low. “We assess risk continuously with every case and with every sort of change, and we continue to look at it as low,” Daskalakis said. “If there are changes, we would reassess that risk in real time.” While the CDC investigation is ongoing, Shah said the further out from the case public health officials get without seeing any new diagnosis, the less likely they become. “We are beyond the typical 10-day window for transmission,” Shah said. “And so with each passing day, the likelihood of this being something that’s happening deep underwater goes down.” XFederal officials say no sign bird flu is spreading among humans, despite Missouri case by Jennifer Shutt, Missouri Independent September 12, 2024 Federal officials say no sign bird flu is spreading among humans, despite Missouri case by Jennifer Shutt, Missouri Independent September 12, 2024 WASHINGTON — Public health officials are still trying to determine how a Missouri resident contracted bird flu without having any contact with infected animals, but said Thursday there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission taking place in small enclaves or in a more widespread manner.

Flu vaccination is especially important for people with cancer or a history of cancer because they can be at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. People with cancer should call their doctor immediately if they get a fever. People with cancer should ask their doctor if they should receive flu antiviral drugs if they have been in contact with someone known or thought to have flu and have received cancer treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the last month or have a blood or lymphatic form of cancer. People at increased risk Cancer may increase the risk of flu complications. People with cancer now or have had certain types of cancer in the past (such as lymphoma or leukemia), are at increased risk of developing flu complications that can be serious. Vaccination is the best protection against flu The best way to prevent flu and its potentially serious complications is for everyone 6 months and older to get a flu vaccine every year. It is especially important for people with cancer to get vaccinated since they are at a higher risk of experiencing complications if they become ill from flu. Injectable influenza vaccines (or flu shots) are recommended for use in people with cancer and other health conditions. Flu shots have a long, established safety record and are safe for people with cancer. It is also important for people who live with or care for cancer patients to be vaccinated against seasonal flu. This may reduce the risk of getting the cancer patient sick. You may need a pneumococcal shot, too Having flu increases your risk of getting pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal pneumonia is an example of a serious flu-related complication that can cause death. People with cancer and other diseases that compromise the immune system also should be up to date with pneumococcal vaccination. You can get the pneumococcal vaccine your provider recommends when you get a flu vaccine. Talk to your health care provider to find out which pneumococcal vaccines are recommended for you. Treatment People with cancer should call their doctor immediately if they get a fever. Fever can be a sign that a person with cancer has flu or other illness; fever can occur after a vaccination or occur for other reasons. Plan in advance with your doctor about what to do if you get sick. CDC recommends you take flu antiviral drugs to treat flu illness, if your doctor prescribes them. Ask your doctor if you should receive flu antiviral drugs if you have been in contact with someone known or thought to have flu and you have received cancer treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the last month, or you have a blood or lymphatic form of cancer.

The guidelines are designed primarily for health care providers who manage patients with influenza virus infection, and will also serve as a reference source for policymakers and others in efforts towards epidemic and pandemic preparedness.Influenza is a viral disease. Seasonal influenza is common in all parts of the world. It is estimated that there are around a billion cases of seasonal influenza annually, including 3–5 million cases of severe respiratory illness. An estimated 290 000-650 000 deaths each year are due to seasonal influenza related respiratory disease, in addition to the deaths related to other influenza-related complications.Along with seasonal influenza viruses, animal influenza viruses – most commonly avian and swine influenza viruses – can occasionally infect humans. They can cause disease ranging from mild conjunctivitis to severe pneumonia and even death. Current animal influenza viruses have not shown the capacity to transmit from person to person, but do pose a pandemic threat for the future. These guidelines provide recommendations on the use of antiviral medications, and other treatments such as steroids for immune system regulation. This update applies to patients with seasonal influenza viruses, potential pandemic influenza viruses, and new influenza type A viruses that are known to cause severe illness in infected humans. A Guideline Development Group of content experts, clinicians, patients, ethicists and methodologists analysed available data and produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guideline development using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.The recommendations form part of WHO’s response to influenza, which includes the work of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), and the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) framework which addresses gaps in access to effective medical therapies and other tools.

The virome is the collection of viruses in a sample, in this case a wastewater sample. The information was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Until March 2024, H5N1 had not been detected in 1,337 wastewater samples analyzed by the team. But from March 4 to July 15 (the end of data collection for this article), H5N1 was detected in 10 of 10 cities, 22 of 23 sites, and 100 of 399 samples. However, the abundance of H5N1 in wastewater samples collected over time did not correlate with influenza-related hospitalizations over the same time period, so the risk to the public was extremely low. UTHealth Houston and Baylor established the wastewater testing program as part of the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute (TEPHI). The sequencing protocol used by the team can detect genetic changes that might indicate an adaptation of the virus to mammals, perhaps even humans. Lack of clinical burden in humans and genomic information suggested that the source of the virus load found in wastewater during that time span came from animal origins. But continued surveillance is critical for monitoring any evolutionary adaptations that would indicate the potential for it to jump to humans, the researchers concluded.

Boerwinkle and Hanson are also members of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Houston Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. The team detects viruses in wastewater by using a viral probe capture set targeting thousands of viral species or variants. Since May 2022, TEPHI has detected more than 400 human and animal viruses, several of which (SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and mpox) have correlated to clinical case data in the population.

The mechanisms for organ-specific LEC responses to environmental cues are not well understood. We found robust lymphangiogenesis during influenza A virus infection in the adult mouse lung. We show that the number of LECs increases twofold at 7 days post-influenza infection (dpi) and threefold at 21 dpi, and that lymphangiogenesis is preceded by lymphatic dilation. We also show that the expanded lymphatic network enhances fluid drainage to mediastinal lymph nodes. Using EdU labeling, we found that a significantly higher number of pulmonary LECs are proliferating at 7 dpi compared to LECs in homeostatic conditions. Lineage tracing during influenza indicates that new pulmonary LECs are derived from preexisting LECs rather than non-LEC progenitors. Lastly, using a conditional LEC-specific YAP/TAZ knockout model, we established that lymphangiogenesis, fluid transport and the immune response to influenza are independent of YAP/TAZ activity in LECs. These findings were unexpected, as they indicate that YAP/TAZ signaling is not crucial for these processes.

These vessels are lined with specialized lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), which maintain their identity through the constitutive expression of Prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1)2 and are characterized by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) expression3,4,5. Lymphatics modulate interstitial fluid drainage and transport immune cells and antigen to lymph nodes6. Signaling between LECs and immune cells also directs chemotaxis7 and immune cell proliferation8. During respiratory tract inflammation, these functions are essential, as excessive tissue fluid buildup or an ineffective immune response could severely compromise lung function.New lymphatic vessel growth, or lymphangiogenesis, can be observed in inflamed tissue9. Although this has been shown in the respiratory system in response to several types of injury, including bacterial infection10,11 and pulmonary fibrosis12,13, it is unknown whether it occurs in response to acute viral infections such as influenza.Influenza viruses target the respiratory epithelium, triggering severe inflammation14. In spite of advances in prophylaxis and treatment approaches, influenza infection is associated with 14% of acute respiratory disease-related hospitalizations15 and an estimated 290,000–650,000 annual respiratory deaths worldwide16. Concentrating on the host's response, which is pivotal in determining influenza's severity and outcome, opens avenues for novel therapeutic interventions. In this context, lymphatic vessel dysfunction might weaken tissue resilience and impede pathogen removal. Facilitating pulmonary lymphatic responses could theoretically, therefore, enhance viral elimination, counteract damaging immune dysregulation and strengthen fluid removal in severe cases. The Hippo pathway, known for its high conservation and central role in cell proliferation, organ development and morphogenesis, and tissue responses to injury could be key in guiding lymphatic endothelial cell behavior during influenza infection17,18,19.Mechanical stimuli, such as stretch and shear forces are common environmental cues that modulate Hippo signaling17,18,20,21. In Hippo signaling, two downstream effectors jointly regulate gene expression: Yes-associated protein (YAP), encoded by the Yap1 gene, and Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), encoded by the Wwtr1 gene. YAP and TAZ protein activity depend on intracellular localization. Nuclear YAP and TAZ regulate a wide variety of target genes, whereas cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ are targeted for degradation22. Notably, YAP/TAZ depletion23,24 or hyperactivation23 in LECs during embryonic development results in structurally aberrant and poorly functional lymphatics and lethality, highlighting its importance in early development of the lymphatic system. In adults, however, intact Hippo signaling in LECs is less critical for maintaining lymphatic integrity during homeostasis23. The functional role(s) of Hippo signaling in adult lung LECs, particularly during inflammatory responses, remain unexplored.In blood endothelial cells, mechanosensitive signaling20,21 and molecular signals such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)25,26,27 act through the Hippo pathway to regulate cell proliferation. The major pro-lymphangiogenic growth factor, VEGF-C, also influences Hippo signaling23,24. While increased fluid influx and altered levels of cytokines and growth factors are key characteristics of the lung’s inflammatory response, to our knowledge, no study has investigated what role YAP/TAZ signaling might play in pulmonary lymphatic vessels as they respond to influenza-induced inflammation.Here we show that the pulmonary lymphatic system undergoes extensive dilation and lymphangiogenesis in a mouse model of influenza infection. We show by lineage tracing that the expanded lymphatic network in the lung derives from existing LECs. We also demonstrate that there is a significantly higher number of proliferating pulmonary LECs during influenza. The resulting lymphatic network exhibits increased fluid drainage from the lung to mediastinal lymph nodes. In view of these findings, we investigated the role of the Hippo signaling pathway in LECs during influenza. Our results demonstrate that LEC-specific deletion of these Hippo pathway effectors revealed that YAP/TAZ signaling is dispensable for pulmonary lymphangiogenesis, lymphatic drainage and host response in the adult lung during influenza. These findings were unanticipated, as they suggest that Hippo-dependent signaling is not crucial for these processes in adults. This discovery yields new avenues for understanding the mechanisms underlying pulmonary responses to influenza A infection and the regulation of lymphatic function in adult lungs.ResultsPulmonary lymphangiogenesis in influenza pneumoniaTo investigate the pulmonary lymphatic vessel responses to influenza infection, we intratracheally infected the left lobe of mice with PR8 influenza and harvested left lungs at 3-, 7- and 21-days post-infection (dpi) for paraffin-embedding and sectioning. Mice were weighed daily during the time-course of infection to assess morbidity (Supp. Fig. 1). To quantify LECs, comparable sections of the left lung containing a range of proximal and distal airways were obtained from control and infected mice. We then stained for VEGFR3 in lung sections of influenza-infected and control mice to identify lymphatic vessels. We observed a significant and sustained enlargement in the diameter of VEGFR3-positive vessels in the lung during influenza infection as soon as 3 dpi and until at least 21 dpi (Fig. 1A and B). This indicated that the lymphatic vessels are dilated in response to influenza infection.Fig. 1Lymphatic vessels dilate during influenza infection. (A) VEGFR3-positive lymphatic vessels (brown; also denoted with red stars) visualized via IHC are more dilated in influenza-infected lungs than in controls. (B) For each mouse, 20 lymphatic vessel diameters were measured using 3 separate histologic sections; mean and SD are shown for n = 3 mice per condition per time point (3-, 7-, and 21-dpi). Statistical significance by unpaired two tailed t-test with Welch’s correction.Full size imageTo determine whether lymphangiogenesis accompanied vessel dilation, we quantified the lung LEC population by labeling LEC nuclei during a time-course of influenza infection. In order to do this, we stained for PROX1 at 3, 7 and 21 dpi and enumerated LECs in each histological section comparing influenza-infected lungs with controls. This experiment revealed a doubling of LECs by 7 dpi that continued to increase through 21 dpi (Fig. 2A and B). Our findings indicate that influenza infection not only leads to the enlargement of existing lymphatic vessels but also stimulates the expansion of LEC number. To assess the overall pattern of lung lymphangiogenesis in influenza, we examined the left lungs of control and infected PROX1-CreERT2dTomato mice at 7dpi. In this study, we found uniform expansion of the lymphatic network (Supp. Fig. 2).Fig. 2Influenza infection induces pulmonary lymphangiogenesis. (A) PROX1-positive LEC nuclei (brown; also denoted with black arrowheads) visualized via IHC are more numerous in influenza-infected lungs than in controls at 7 and 21 dpi. (B) For each mouse, LEC nuclei were quantified using 3–5 tissue sections from influenza-infected and control mice; mean and SD are shown for n = 3–5 mice per condition per time point. Statistical significance by unpaired one tailed t-test with Welch’s correction.Full size imagePulmonary lymphangiogenesis in influenza is driven by LEC proliferationTo identify the source of new LECs in the lymphatic network in influenza-infected lungs, we employed two independent approaches. Firstly, to label nascent DNA incorporation, 5-Ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) was administered to mice during influenza infection. Lungs were harvested at 7 dpi and immunofluorescently co-stained for PROX1 and EdU (Fig. 3A and B). While proliferating LECs were very rarely observed in control tissues, approximately 20% of LECs in influenza-infected lungs had incorporated EdU by 7 dpi (3b). Of note, EdU uptake in LECs was noted in all regions of the lung. Secondly, we investigated the possibility that an exogenous progenitor cell might play a role in influenza-induced lymphangiogenesis. To address this question, tamoxifen-induced LEC lineage labeling was performed in PROX1-CreERT2dTomato mice prior to influenza infection. The proportion of tdTomato positive LECs observed during influenza infection was then compared to control lungs. Despite the increased number of LECs observed during influenza (data not shown), there was a similar proportion of lineage labeled cells at 7 dpi (Fig. 3C and D). These findings demonstrate that PROX1-negative progenitor cells are not contributing to lymphangiogenesis during influenza. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a PROX1-positive progenitor. Notably, EdU uptake in LECs was not observed in the liver, heart, or esophageal tissues, indicating that LEC proliferation during influenza was specific to the lungs (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest endogenous lung LEC proliferation in response to influenza infection contributes to LEC expansion.Fig. 3LECs proliferate in response to influenza infection. (A) C57Bl/6 mice were administered saline or PR8 followed by EdU injections, and lungs were harvested at 7 dpi followed by IF staining for PROX1 and EdU. White arrowheads indicate PROX1+/EdU+ cells.

Statistical significance by unpaired two-tailed Mann Whitney test.Full size imageLymphatic transport in influenza pneumoniaConsistent with published literature, influenza infection leads to pronounced inflammation, and pulmonary edema. In this regard, we observed significantly higher lung wet-to-dry weight ratios during influenza infection as compared to controls, indicative of pulmonary edema (Fig. 4A). To investigate the functional properties of the expanded lymphatic network, we instilled a 10 kDa fluorescent dextran molecule into the left lung airspaces and measured fluorescence in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node (mLN) (Fig. 4B and C). We observed a significantly higher fluorescent signal in the mLNs of influenza-infected mice as compared to control at 15 min. There was minimal fluorescent signal detected in non-draining inguinal LNs indicating local lymphatic drainage as opposed to blood vessel drainage was primarily responsible for transport of dextran (data not shown). Collectively, these findings indicate that the expanded lymphatic network in the influenza-infected lung is associated with enhanced lymphatic transport.Fig. 4Lymphatic fluid drainage from the lung is enhanced during influenza infection.

Statistical significance by unpaired two-tailed Mann Whitney test.Full size imageRole of Hippo signaling during influenza-induced pulmonary lymphangiogenesisThe Hippo pathway is a fundamental mediator of cell proliferation during development and is activated in response to injury and mechanical cues. Notably, Hippo signaling in LECs is critical for lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic patterning during embryonic development23,24. To determine the role for Hippo signaling in LECs during influenza-induced lymphangiogenesis, we utilized a previously published model of Hippo pathway deletion in LECs (Prox1-CreERT2/Yap1(YAP)-fl/Wwtr1(TAZ)-fl, hereafter YAP/TAZ△LEC). In all experiments, Cre(−) littermates given tamoxifen were used as controls.First, we validated YAP and TAZ depletion in LECs using immunofluorescent staining of lung histologic sections and by validating the presence of the floxed YAP and TAZ alleles after tamoxifen administration (Supp. Figs. 3 and 4). To confirm efficient PROX1-Cre-mediated recombination, we analyzed tdTomato expression in LECs in mice at least 2 weeks after tamoxifen administration to Prox1-CreERT2/TdTomato mice (Supp. Fig. 5). Next, we analyzed influenza-infected lungs for differences in histologic lymphatic phenotype, including lymphatic vessel diameter measurement and LEC enumeration as previously described. We identified no significant differences in these two parameters between Cre(+) and Cre(−) YAP/TAZ△LEC littermates, either at baseline, 7 or 16 dpi (Fig. 5A–F). Similarly, no differences in Prox1 or Flt4 mRNA were observed in whole lung homogenates obtained from either Cre(+) or Cre(−) YAP/TAZ△LEC littermates at 7 dpi (Fig. 5G).Fig. 5There is no significant difference in lymphatic histologic scoring or lymphatic fluid drainage from the lung between Cre(−) and Cre(+) YAP/TAZ△LEC littermates at baseline or during influenza. (A) Experimental design; image created in BioRender. (B,C) VEGFR3-positive lymphatic vessels (brown, also denoted with red stars; airway, AW; blood vessel, BV) visualized via IHC in Cre(−) or Cre(+) littermates had similar diameters at baseline and during influenza at 7 or 16 dpi. For each mouse, 20 lymphatic vessel diameters were measured using 3 separate histologic sections; mean and SD are shown for n = 3 mice per condition per time point. Statistical significance by unpaired two-tailed Mann Whitney test. (D–F) PROX1-positive LEC nuclei (brown) were visualized via IHC at baseline or during influenza at 7 or 16 dpi for Cre(−) and Cre(+) littermates. For each mouse, LEC nuclei were quantified using 3 tissue sections from influenza-infected and control mice; mean and SD are shown for n = 3 mice per condition per time point. Statistical significance by unpaired two tailed t-test with Welch’s correction. (G) Prox1 and Flt4 mRNA was quantified from left lobes collected from Cre(−) or Cre(+) littermates at 7 dpi after influenza infection. Median and IQR are shown for n = 7–17 mice per group.

(I–J) Fluorometric quantification of Dextran-488 in mediastinal LN 50 min (saline) or 15 min (influenza) after IT instillation into left lung lobe of Cre(−) or Cre(+) littermates. Mean and SD are shown for n = 3–10 mice per condition per timepoint. Statistical significance by unpaired two-tailed Mann Whitney test.Full size imageTo determine whether there were differences in pulmonary edema in the context of Hippo deletions, we measured lung wet-to-dry weight ratios during influenza as well as control conditions, and found no difference between Cre(+) and Cre(−) YAP/TAZ△LEC littermates (Fig. 5H).The dextran transport assay was utilized to interrogate the functionality of lymphatics for passive drainage in uninfected lungs. In these experiments, no significant difference was observed in fluorescent signal measured in the lung-draining mLNs of Cre(+) vs Cre(−) YAP/TAZ△LEC littermates at baseline or at 7dpi (Fig. 5I and J). Collectively, the targeted deletion of YAP and TAZ in LECs did not affect lymphangiogenesis or lung lymphatic drainage at baseline or during influenza pneumonia.Infection severity and inflammatory response after deletion of YAP and TAZ in LECsInfection severity28 and inflammatory responses9,29 are known to be affected by aberrant lymphatic function. To address this issue, we first compared survival and weight loss curves after influenza pneumonia in Cre(+) and Cre(−) YAP/TAZ△LEC littermates. No mice reached the humane endpoint in either group, and we found no differences in weight change during or after influenza infection between the two Cre genotypes (Fig. 6A). We then assessed infection severity by plaque assay and qRT-PCR for influenza nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA in murine lungs at 7 dpi and found no difference in these readouts between Cre genotypes (Fig. 6B and C). We also characterized the inflammatory response to influenza in the lung at 7 and 16 dpi in both Cre genotypes. These timepoints mark two critical phases: the lowest point of weight loss and the subsequent return to baseline weight after influenza infection. Detailed inflammation scoring and histopathologic characterization was provided by a veterinary pathologist who was blinded to genotypes. In summary, there were no apparent differences due to YAP/TAZ-deletion in morphological histopathology as assessed by the percent area of consolidation or semiquantitative pathology score (Fig. 6D and E, Supp. Tables 1 and 2).Fig. 6There is no significant difference in infection severity between Cre(−) and Cre(+) YAP/TAZ△LEC littermates after influenza challenge.

Statistical significance by unpaired two-tailed Mann Whitney test.Full size imageLastly, to evaluate differences in immune cell transit between the lung and the lung-draining mLN, we designed an 11-color flow cytometry panel to determine the immunophenotype of the lymph node at 2 and 7 dpi. Using markers for T- cells (CD4, CD8) and B-cells (CD19) as well as markers for dendritic cell subtypes (Ly6C, CD11c, CD11b and CD103), we were able to define cell populations known to be important in the developing adaptive immune response, for which a functional lymphatic vasculature is known to be crucial28,30. While we did observe predictable differences in the mLN immunophenotype between 2 and 7 dpi, we identified no differences in any of the defined immune cell populations between Cre(+) or Cre(−) YAP/TAZ△LEC littermates (Fig. 7A and B).Fig. 7There is no significant difference in mLN immunophenotype between Cre(−) and Cre(+) YAP/TAZ△LEC littermates after influenza challenge. An 11-color flow cytometry panel was used to determine the immunophenotype of the mLN of Cre(−) or Cre(+) littermates at 2 dpi (A) and 7 dpi (B). After the exclusion of doublets and debris, dead cells were excluded using live/dead staining. Immune cells were identified using the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45 (including separate stains for intravascular vs tissue resident CD45(+) cells). The panel included markers for T-cells (CD4, CD8), B-cells (CD19) as well as dendritic cell subtypes (Ly6C, CD11b and CD103 positive and negative subsets of CD11c(+) cells). Monocytes, macrophages and granulocytes were classified generally using Ly6C, CD64, Ly6G and Siglec F. Mean and SD are shown for n = 3–5 mice per group per timepoint.Full size imageDiscussionOur studies demonstrate that the pulmonary lymphatic system expands significantly during severe influenza, via both dilation and lymphangiogenesis. This is a stark change from the quiescent state of the lymphatic plexus during homeostasis31 and is reminiscent of the rapid lymphatic growth seen in development32. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that lymphangiogenesis occurs primarily through proliferation of existing LECs, without an apparent involvement of an exogenous precursor. Moreover, we found that following this expansion, the lymphatic vasculature displays enhanced fluid transport in the presence of significant influenza-induced pulmonary edema. It is important to note that pulmonary edema in the context of influenza is a complex multifactorial process resulting from inflammation, capillary leak and damage to microanatomic barriers. These events are initiated early in the course of infection and, importantly, prior to the onset of lymphangiogenesis. It is not surprising, therefore, to observe residual edema despite increased lymphatic flow at 7dpi. Furthermore, while increased lymphatic fluid transport could have implications for dissemination of virus in other contexts33, the PR8 model of infection is self-limited and not characterized by dissemination from the lung34.The inflammation resulting from influenza infection may trigger responses in LECs through mechanical signals. For example, alterations in extracellular matrix (ECM) composition may modulate matrix stiffness, as has been reported in pulmonary fibrosis35. Higher fluid volume within the lymphatics can increase circumferential stretch36. As YAP/TAZ intracellular localization is sensitive to such physical changes37,38,39, we investigated whether the Hippo pathway plays a part in orchestrating the lymphatic response to influenza-induced inflammation.We found that during influenza-induced lymphangiogenesis, the targeted deletion of YAP and TAZ in PROX1-expressing cells had no effect on fluid transport from the lung to the draining lymph nodes at baseline or during influenza infection. Lymphatic vessel diameter, LEC number, Prox1 and Flt4 mRNA transcription and lung wet-to-dry weight ratios at 7 dpi were also unaffected by LEC-specific YAP/TAZ deletion.Previous work has yielded conflicting findings regarding the regulatory relationship between YAP/TAZ and PROX1. Using PROX1-driven, Cre-mediated deletion of YAP and TAZ, Cho et. al. find that YAP and TAZ activity opposes PROX1 expression during development, limiting lymphangiogenesis23. Conversely, in vitro experiments show that both YAP and TAZ knockdown and hyperactivation are associated with diminished PROX1 expression24. In our studies, the lymphatic remodeling we observed in response to influenza was not perturbed or enhanced in YAP/TAZ△LEC animals. In this regard, deleting these effectors did not significantly affect the morphological or functional characteristics measured. While Hippo signaling is involved in fundamental cellular events during both development and in tissue repair in the adult17, our results show that YAP and TAZ do not play a role in lung LECs during the lymphangiogenic response to influenza. In this respect, the role of Hippo signaling during lung lymphangiogenesis in adulthood contrasts with its apparent function during development. Overall, our work demonstrates that during inflammation-induced expansion of pre-existing lymphatic vasculature during adulthood, Hippo signaling is dispensable in LECs.Broadly speaking, it is important to note that the precise role of an expanded lymphatic network accompanying tissue injury remains controversial and possibly organ and context-dependent9,10,12,13,27,40,41,42,43. In tracheal Mycoplasma pulmonis infection, inhibiting lymphangiogenesis promotes edema and interferes with immune cell trafficking to lymph nodes10, while in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, promoting lymphangiogenesis was shown to reduce type I collagen accumulation12. Further, in a mouse model of aspiration pneumonia, inhibition of lymphatic growth improved oxygen saturation41. However, inducing lymphangiogenesis reduced inflammation, improved lymphatic drainage and increased left lung aeration in mouse lung transplant allografts27. In the skin, lymphangiogenesis facilitates tissue resilience9,42. Most notably, genetic blockade of lymphangiogenesis did not significantly affect cardiac function in a mouse model of myocardial infarction43. Whether an expanded lymphatic network facilitates tissue recovery from diffuse lung injury will require additional study. This study demonstrates that Hippo signaling is not critical for lymphatic function and expansion during influenza. The question as to whether the expanded network is required for recovery remains to be answered.Materials and methodsMiceC57BL/6J mice were obtained from Jackson laboratories and housed in the Boston University Animal Science Center on a 12-h light–dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum. Prox1-Cre-ERT2 mice and TdTomato reporter mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (strain #022075 and strain #007914, respectively). The YAPloxP/loxP mice and Wwtr1/TAZloxP/loxP mice used to generate the YAP/TAZ△LEC mice reported here were provided by Dr. Jeffrey Wrana (LTRI institute) (Jackson Laboratory Strain #030532). Our study examined both male and female animals with the sex of the mice randomized across experimental groups. Similar findings are reported for both sexes. At time of sacrifice, mice were ethically euthanized using isoflurane and inferior vena cava incision. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant IACUC guidelines and regulations and are reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with approved Boston University animal protocols PROTO201800710_TR01 and PROTO201800057_TR01.Influenza infectionMice aged 8–16 weeks were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of 75 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine and infected with 20–400 PFU of influenza A/H1N1/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus via intratracheal instillation directed into the left lung lobe. Mice were weighed daily post-infection until time of sacrifice or until all animals had returned to their pre-infection weights. In all studies, a humane endpoint of reaching 70% of starting body weight was employed.Tamoxifen administrationTo induce Cre activity, Prox1-Cre-ERT2 mice aged 6–12 weeks were administered 100 mg/kg tamoxifen dissolved in corn oil to a concentration of 30 mg/mL via intra-peritoneal injection daily for 5 days, then rested for at least 14 days before experimental use.EdU administrationTo induce EdU labeling of proliferating cells, influenza infected or control C57BL/6J mice aged 8–12 weeks were administered 10 mg/kg EdU dissolved in sterile saline to a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL via intra-peritoneal injection daily from 4 to 6 dpi.Tissue processingMice were euthanized and their lungs perfused through the left ventricle of the heart using 10 mL of ice-cold HBSS. Left lungs were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde, then washed in PBS (pH 7.4), dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin embedded lungs were cut into 5 µm sections using a microtome and dried overnight at 42 °C. Comparable anterior/posterior sections of the left lung containing a range of proximal and distal airways were obtained from each mouse throughout the study.Immunostaining and microscopyParaffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and then rehydrated. Antigen- retrieval was performed by heating with citrate-based antigen-unmasking solution (Vector). For experiments using HRP detection, endogenous peroxidase was quenched using 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. Non-specific antigen binding was blocked using donkey serum. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies at the dilutions shown below before application of secondary antibodies. Samples containing EdU were also counter stained per protocol using the Click-IT™ EdU Cell Proliferation Kit (Invitrogen #C10339). For HRP detection, Vectastain ABC and DAB kits were used. Sections were counterstained using hematoxylin, dehydrated and cover slipped. Samples using immunofluorescent antibodies were counter-stained with DAPI before analysis.For PROX1 nuclei counting, non-serial murine lung tissue sections approximately 350 µm apart were stained as described above. Nuclei were visualized via light microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse E200 microscope or Leica DM4 B microscope with a Leica DFC7000 T camera. Immunofluorescent samples were imaged using a Leica DM4 B microscope with a Leica DFC7000 T camera. Whole lungs from Prox1-Cre-ERT2/TdTomato mice were imaged using a Zeiss STEMI 508 DOC Stereo Microscope with a NIGHTSEA green fluorescence light source and an AXIOCAM 208 8MP HD/4K camera. We would also like to acknowledge S10OD030269 instrumentation for supporting the microscopic analysis. See Table 1 for list of antibodies and dilutions.Table 1 List of antibodies used for histologic staining.Full size tableHistopathology scoring and quantitative image analysisDigitalized whole slide images (WSI) of brightfield H&E were generated using PhenoImager HT 2.0 Automated Quantitative Pathology Image System (Akoya Biosciences, Marlborough, Massachusetts, USA). H&E-stained slides were scanned at a 200× magnification using a bright field scan profile. Quantification of the pulmonary inflammatory lesions were achieved by using the HALO image analysis software v3.5 (Indica labs). Each image was first annotated by a veterinary pathologist to define the regions of interest for image analysis. Total examined pulmonary parenchyma with associated airways of three replicate sections were included in the region of interest. All processing artifacts (i.e. tissue folds and dust) were also manually removed via exclusion annotations. Using the random forest V2 algorithm provided with HALO image analysis software, two classes were defined: normal and pulmonary consolidation. The full spectrum of histopathological changes was included in the algorithm, which included lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic interstitial pneumonia and type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and dysplasia. The exact same classifier algorithm was applied to all images in this study to yield the pulmonary consolidation quantification results. The pathologist reviewed all the slides in a blinded fashion and developed ordinal histopathology criteria for scoring (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).Table 2 List of antibodies used for flow cytometry.Full size tableFor quantitative image analysis of YAP and TAZ immunofluorescent staining in LECs in lung histologic sections, PROX1 staining was used to localize the cells of interest and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of either YAP or TAZ staining was quantified using CellProfilerR. Data were obtained by imaging all LECs on at least 3 separate non-serial histologic lung sections per mouse.Flow cytometryMice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of 75 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine and injected retro-orbitally with 2 ug of IV CD45.2 antibody. This was allowed to circulate for 3 min prior to sacrifice. Mediastinal lymph nodes (mLNs) were collected from influenza infected mice as well as controls and placed in 1 mL of cold PBS. LN tissue was passed through a 100 um strainer in a petri dish by crushing with a rubber syringe plunger and the strainer was washed with 3 mL cold FACS buffer. The single cell suspension was placed in 15 mL FACS tubes and centrifuged at 300×g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 mL FACS buffer. Cell number was enumerated using a hemocytometer. Cell suspensions were diluted to 1 × 106 cells/mL and 1 mL of cell suspension (1 × 106 cells) placed in new FACS tubes. Cell solutions were blocked with anti-CD16/32 (FcBlock, eBioscience) at a dilution of 1 ug per 1 × 106 cells. Fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibody staining was performed using the antibodies and dilutions noted in the table for 30 min on ice in the dark. Excess antibody was removed by washing with 1 mL FACS buffer and centrifugation at 300×g at 4 °C for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 300 μL FACS buffer. Cells were stained with 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BD Biosci.). Unstained cells, single-stained OneComp eBeads (eBioscience), and fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls were used for each analysis. Data were acquired on a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using BD FACSDiva software. FlowJoR 10 was utilized for data analysis. See Table 2 for list of antibodies and dilutions.qRT-PCRRNA isolation from mouse whole lung homogenates was performed using the Direct-zol RNA Microprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR was performed using the Taqman and QuantStudio 3 (Applied Biosystems) systems according to the manufacturer’s instructions. See Table 3 for list of primers and probes.Table 3 List of primers and probes used for PCR and qRT-PCR.Full size tableViral plaque assayLeft lung lobes from influenza infected mice were minced using a sterile razor blade in a petri dish, transferred to a bullet blender tube in 2 mL of viral growth media (as below), and homogenized. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 5000×g at 4 °C for 5 min, and supernatant was collected and used to infect MDCK cells. Plaques were enumerated after 3 days44.Viral growth media (500 mL): a. 475 mL of DMEM (ThermoFisher ref 11995-065). b. 5 mL Pen/Strep 100x (ThermoFisher 15140122). c. 12.5 mL of 1 M HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich H0887). d. 5 mL Glutamax 100x (ThermoFisher 35050061). e. 3 mL of 35% BSA stock (Sigma-Aldrich A7409) OR 3.3 ml of 30% BSA. Lung wet to dry weight ratioLeft lung lobes were collected from influenza infected and uninfected mice. Lungs were weighed immediately after collection to obtain the wet weight, then desiccated for 48 h at 65 °C and weighed again to obtain the dry weight45.Dextran transport assayMice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of 75 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine before injection intratracheally into the left lung lobe with 10 μL of 10 mg/mL of 10 kDa Dextran-488 (Invitrogen #D22910) dissolved in sterile normal saline (NS), or equivalent volume of NS (vehicle-only) for control mice46. Mice were allowed to recover for 15 or 50 min prior to sacrifice. Mediastinal LNs and inguinal LNs were collected from each mouse and placed in 280 μL of protein extraction buffer (EB; Tris pH 7.4 25 mM, NaCl 50 mM, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, 2% NP-40, and 0.2% SDS dissolved in ddH2O) with proteinase inhibitor (Roche #11836153001, final 1× concentration). LN tissue was passed through a 70 μm strainer in a petri dish by crushing with a rubber syringe plunger and the strainer was washed with 200μL cold EB. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000×g at 4 °C for 20 min, and supernatant was collected. Fluorometric quantification was performed using an Agilent BioTek Synergy LX Multi-Mode fluorescence plate reader. Fluorometric values for mLNs were obtained by subtracting background fluorescence as measured in inguinal LNs.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using a two-tailed Student’s t-test in the case of data shown to be parametric via the Shapiro–Wilk test. Welches’ correction was used to account for differences in variance. If the data was non-parametric, a Mann–Whitney U test was used. A p-value of 0.05 was used as the threshold for statistical significance.

The US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination and updated COVID-19 vaccination for everyone aged 6 months and older, the pneumococcal vaccine for people at high-risk for severe disease and those younger than 5 years and 65 years and older, and the RSV vaccine for adults aged 75 years and older, high-risk adults aged 60 to 74 years, and pregnant women at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation from September to January.More willingness to get flu than COVID vaccineA national survey today by Ohio State University investigators reveals that 56% of 1,006 US adults plan to get vaccinated against the flu this year, and 43% say they will receive a COVID-19 vaccine, but 37% say they don't need vaccines, and the same proportion say they've been vaccinated before but won't do so this year. Respondents aged 65 and older are the most likely to receive recommended vaccines. Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation about vaccinations, but the reality is that they are safe and highly effective in preventing serious illness and death. Nora Colburn, MD The weighted, probability-based survey was conducted by phone or online from August 16 to 18, 2024. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percentage points at the 95% confidence level."Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation about vaccinations, but the reality is that they are safe and highly effective in preventing serious illness and death," Nora Colburn, MD, said in the Ohio State press release. "Older adults, people with certain chronic medical conditions, and those who are pregnant are especially at risk during respiratory virus season."Some health workers think they're low-riskFor the second study, researchers in Rennes, France, used an anonymous online survey to estimate flu and COVID-19 vaccine uptake, identify the reasons behind vaccination decisions, and determine plans to get the vaccines the following year among healthcare workers (HCWs) at a network of academic hospitals in fall 2022 and winter 2022-23.Easy access to COVID and influenza vaccines in the workplace, and better information about their benefits, may improve their uptake.Of the 1,587 respondents, 30% were paramedics, 20% were medics, 16% were administrative workers, and 15% were nurse assistants. Two percent of HCWs reported having a contraindication to either vaccine, and 8% were at risk for severe flu or COVID.The results, published this week in Vaccine, show that 64% and 42% of HCWs were vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19, respectively. A multivariable analysis found that being a medic or older than 40 years was linked to receipt of both the flu and COVID-19 vaccines. Adverse-event rates among vaccinated HCWs were 8% and 37% after flu and COVID-19 vaccination, respectively; 61% of these events were mild and transient.Of the 19% of HCWs who did not receive the flu vaccine, 85% said they refused it because of the following reasons: they considered themselves not at risk for severe illness (51%), the vaccine was not mandatory (25%), they didn't trust the vaccine (25%), or they thought the vaccine was ineffective (18%). In total, just 38% of HCWs believed the 2022-23 flu vaccine to be effective, and 36% said they would have received the vaccine had they been told it was effective."Although influenza and COVID vaccines are recommended for healthcare workers (HCWs), vaccine coverage is sub-optimal for influenza in this population, and the situation did not improve during the COVID pandemic," the study authors wrote. "Easy access to COVID and influenza vaccines in the workplace, and better information about their benefits, may improve their uptake," they concluded. "Future vaccination campaigns should communicate more about potential adverse effects, and effectiveness."Mental illness and lower COVID vaccine uptakeYesterday in Psychiatry Online, Kaiser Permanente researchers in Georgia, Washington, and Southern California reported on the link between psychiatric conditions and the odds of receiving flu and COVID-19 vaccines among more than 1.3 million people over 1 year. The vaccination rates observed for individuals with and without diagnosed psychiatric conditions were below national benchmarks, suggesting room for improving vaccine uptake in both patient populations.They also assessed the influence of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on vaccine uptake. Psychiatric patients were matched by age and sex with control participants without a psychiatric diagnosis.The probability of receiving a flu vaccine was 18% higher and of receiving a COVID vaccine 3% lower in the psychiatric patients than in controls."The findings provide evidence that people with mental health conditions were more likely to receive an influenza vaccine but were less likely to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, compared with individuals without such conditions," the researchers wrote. "However, the vaccination rates observed for individuals with and without diagnosed psychiatric conditions were below national benchmarks, suggesting room for improving vaccine uptake in both patient populations."

People with disabilities and their caregivers should prioritize getting a flu vaccine to reduce risk of flu and serious flu complications. People with disabilities who are at increased risk for serious flu complications should contact their health care provider right away if they get flu symptoms. CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people who have flu or suspected flu and who are at higher risk of serious flu complications, which includes many people with disabilities. Disability overview A disability is any condition of the body or mind that makes daily activities more difficult. It also impacts a person's ability to interact with the world around them. Up to 1 in 4 adults in the United States reports having a disability. There are different types of disabilities, such as those affecting cognition, hearing, mobility, vision, self-care, and independent living. These disabilities may affect a person's thinking, movement, learning, communication, and mental health. Keep Reading: Disability and Health Overview Who's at risk Flu can be particularly dangerous for people with certain disabilities and medical conditions. This includes those who may struggle with muscle function, lung function, or have difficulty coughing, swallowing, or clearing fluids from their airways. These difficulties increase their risk of developing flu-related complications that could require hospitalization. People with disabilities, such as those with limited mobility, may be at higher risk of getting flu. This is because they cannot reduce contact with others who may be infected, like direct service providers, caretakers, and family members. Some people with disabilities may have trouble understanding or practicing prevention measures for infections like flu. This includes actions like handwashing or avoiding contact with people who are sick. They may be unable to communicate or be monitored closely enough to know if they are sick or have symptoms. Symptoms and Treatment People with disabilities that place them at higher risk of developing serious flu complications should call their health care provider right away if they get flu symptoms. CDC recommends prompt flu antiviral treatment for people who have flu or suspected flu and who are at higher risk of serious flu complications, which includes many people with disabilities.

Direct service providers, caregivers, and family members can also protect their loved ones by getting vaccinated. This action safeguards both themselves and the people they care for. CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a seasonal flu vaccine each year, ideally by the end of October. Protection from flu vaccination sets in after about two weeks after getting vaccinated. In addition to reducing risk of flu, flu vaccination has been shown to lessen the severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick. Keep Reading: Benefits of the Flu VaccineTypes of flu vaccines for people with disabilities There are several flu vaccine options, and your health care provider can recommend one that is appropriate for you. People with certain medical conditions or disabilities, like weakened immune systems or cochlear implants, should not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine.

Shortly before, the DHSS said the sample that tested positive for H5 at the state lab was from a patient who was hospitalized on August 22. The patient is an adult with underlying conditions who has since recovered.First US case without occupational exposureThe case is the fourteenth human H5 case of the year and the first in a patient who didn't have known occupational exposure to sick animals.Missouri hasn't reported any cattle outbreaks. According to University of Missouri Extension, the state is the nation's 26th-largest milk producer, with dairy production concentrated in the southwest and south central parts of the state. Missouri has reported sporadic avian flu outbreaks in poultry, but not since February. The virus has also been found several times in wild birds in the state, but none of the latest notifications had recent sample collection dates.The CDC said its surveillance hasn’t found any unusual sign of flu activity in the United States, including in Missouri.Health officials are eager to see if sequencing sheds light on whether the virus is linked to the B3.13 genotype circulating in cows, if there are links to other human cases, or if there are ties to other animals, which could include birds or even cats, mice, or other wildlife.Experts are also looking at the possibility of exposure to raw milk. Raw milk sales are legal in Missouri, but only directly from farms to consumers.The CDC said the main priority is to see if any ongoing transmission is occurring, but for now, the risk to the public remains low. "Findings from the ongoing investigation will inform whether guidance changes are needed," it said.H5N1 strikes cows in another Michigan countyIn other avian flu developments, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) today announced an H5N1 outbreak at a dairy farm in Shiawassee County, which is about 35 miles northwest of Lansing.The outbreak brings Michigan's total to 29 affected dairy herds in 12 counties. In a statement, MDARD said the samples, which were positive at the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, will be sent to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory for confirmation testing.The USDA has confirmed 197 outbreaks in 14 states.

The study revealed a noticeable fluctuation trend in influenza incidence rates in Xinjiang, particularly notable spikes observed in 2019 and 2023. The results of the 3-year moving average showed a significant long-term upward trend in influenza incidence rates, confirmed by Theil-Sen method (MAD = 2.202, p < 0.01). Global spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated significant positive spatial autocorrelation in influenza incidence rates from 2016 and from 2018 to 2023 (Moran’s I > 0, P < 0.05). Local spatial autocorrelation analysis further revealed clustering patterns in different regions, with high-high clustering and low-high clustering predominating in northern Xinjiang, and low-low clustering predominating in southern Xinjiang. Hotspot analysis indicated a progressive rise in the number of influenza incidence hotspots, primarily concentrated in northern Xinjiang, particularly in Urumqi, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, and Hotan Prefecture. Standard deviation ellipse analysis and the trajectory of influenza incidence gravity center migration showed that the transmission range of influenza in Xinjiang has been expanding, with the epidemic center gradually moving northward. The spatiotemporal heterogeneity of influenza incidence in Xinjiang highlights the need for differentiated and precise influenza prevention and control strategies in different regions to address the changing trends in influenza prevalence.

The rapid spread and extensive impact of influenza epidemics pose significant threats to public health and societal stability2. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 10% of the global population is affected by influenza annually, leading to a large number of cases and around 500,000 deaths3, thereby imposing a substantial disease burden and economic losses.Globally, influenza epidemics exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, with winter and spring often being peak periods for influenza activity4. To effectively combat influenza epidemics, the WHO actively promotes the establishment and enhancement of a global influenza surveillance network to monitor influenza activity levels and trends in real-time, aiming to identify and address potential health risks promptly5. The annual influenza reports published by the WHO provide essential references for countries to develop targeted prevention and control strategies.In China, influenza is also a significant public health issue6. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other relevant departments actively conduct influenza surveillance, collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data to understand the dynamic changes in influenza epidemics7. However, due to the large population, vast territory, and diverse climates, the influenza epidemic situation in China is complex and variable8, necessitating more nuanced and targeted influenza prevention and control strategies. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) presents a unique case due to its distinct geographical location and climatic conditions. The Tianshan Mountains divide Xinjiang into northern and southern regions, each exhibiting significant climatic differences. Such a varied situation calls for more precise monitoring and control measures.In recent years, the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in infectious disease research has become increasingly widespread. GIS offers advantages in spatiotemporal analysis, providing new insights and methods for monitoring and controlling influenza epidemics9. By utilizing GIS technology, influenza surveillance data can be spatially visualized and quantitatively analyzed, allowing for a more intuitive understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of epidemics, revealing disease transmission pathways and influencing factors. Previous studies have successfully used GIS technology to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of influenza in various regions of China10, identifying high-risk areas11 and providing scientific bases for targeted prevention and control measures.In the vast and climatically diverse region of Xinjiang, utilizing GIS technology for spatiotemporal analysis of influenza epidemics is particularly crucial. Identifying high-risk areas and transmission pathways can provide scientific evidence for developing targeted prevention and control measures. This study uses influenza surveillance data from Xinjiang to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of influenza incidence at the county level, explore the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and evolution trends of the epidemic, and identify high-risk areas. The aim is to provide theoretical support and practical guidance for influenza epidemic surveillance, early warning, risk assessment, and precise control.MethodsData and sourcesData sourceThe influenza incidence data for 96 counties in Xinjiang from 2014 to 2023 were obtained from the China Infectious Disease Surveillance System, ensuring data reliability. The map data were obtained from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Geological Survey Institute. The map used in this study has a scale of 1:100,000, which shows the administrative subdivisions of the region in detail. To ensure the accuracy of the map boundaries, we compared them with the data from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Platform for Common Geospatial Information Service (https://xinjiang.tianditu.gov.cn/bzdt_code/bzdt.html). This comparison confirmed that the maps are accurate and free of any sensitive geographical information, making them suitable for use in our spatial analysis.Spatial correlationThe influenza incidence data for each county were linked to electronic maps of Xinjiang county boundaries. Using the mapping function of ArcGIS, thematic maps of influenza incidence rates were created. Global Moran’s I was calculated to describe the spatial characteristics of influenza incidence rates across Xinjiang using the formula:$$I = \frac{{\sum _{{i = 1}}^{n} \sum _{{j = 1}}^{n} w_{{ij}} (x_{i} - \bar{x})(x_{j} - \bar{x})}}{{S^{2} \sum _{{i = 1}}^{n} \sum _{{j = 1}}^{n} w_{{ij}} }})$$ (1) where n represents the number of counties, x represents the influenza incidence rates of different counties, \({\bar{x}}\) represents the mean incidence rate, w represents spatial weight.Moran’s I ranges from − 1 to 1. At a significance level of α = 0.05, values near 1 indicate positive spatial autocorrelation, near − 1 indicate negative spatial autocorrelation, and zero indicates randomness. We used Local Moran’s I to analyze spatial autocorrelation patterns at spatial unit levels and conducted LISA to identify clustered areas. Four clustering patterns were identified: HH (high-high), HL (high-low), LL (low-low), and LH (low-high).The Getis-Ord G statistic was utilized as a measure to identify influenza incidence hotspots and cold spots using the formula:$${G}_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}{w}_{ij}{x}_{j}/\sum_{j=1}^{n}{x}_{j}$$ (2) where the meanings of the variables are the same as in Formula (1). Under theα = 0.05 significance level, a positive Gi value suggests a hotspot area of influenza incidence, while a negative Gi value suggests a cold spot area.Gravity center shift model and standard deviation ellipseThe influenza incidence database was linked with the coordinates of each county. The influenza incidence gravity center model was employed to calculate the coordinates of influenza incidence gravity centers for different periods. The formula for calculating the gravity center (\(\overline{X}，\overline{Y}\)) is as follows:$$\overline{X}=\frac{\sum{W}_{i}{x}_{i}}{\sum{W}_{i}}\:\:\overline{Y}=\frac{\sum{W}_{i}{y}_{i}}{\sum{W}_{i}}$$ (3) where xi and yi represent the coordinates of the ith county, and Wi represents the weight of the ith county, which in this study is the influenza incidence rate.The standard deviation ellipse method simultaneously analyzes the direction and distribution of data. The size of the ellipse reflects the concentration of influenza incidence reports in Xinjiang on a spatial scale. The length of the major axis indicates the direction of data distribution, while the length of the minor axis represents the range of data distribution. The greater the difference between the lengths of the major and minor axes (i.e., the larger the eccentricity), the more pronounced the directionality of the data. Conversely, if the lengths of the major and minor axes are closer, it indicates less pronounced directionality.Statistical methodsExcel 2019 was used to establish the influenza incidence database. R 4.3.2 software for trend analysis and plotting line graphs. ArcGIS 10.8 software was utilized for map visualization and spatial analysis. Spatial exploratory analysis included global spatial autocorrelation analysis, local spatial autocorrelation analysis, and hotspot analysis. Spatial descriptive analysis employed gravity center analysis and standard deviation ellipse analysis methods.ResultsIncidence characteristicsFrom 2014 to 2023, a total of 96 counties in Xinjiang reported 103,887 cases of influenza, with annual incidence rates of 9.86/100,000, 3.85/100,000, 10.16/100,000, 26.01/100,000, 88.80/100,000, 20.06/100,000, 7.78/100,000, 16.5/100,000, and 234.61/100,000. Over the past decade, the incidence rate has shown significant fluctuations. In 2015, the incidence rate reached its lowest point at 3.85/100,000, while in 2019, it significantly increased to 88.80/ 100,000, and then sharply rose to 234.61/100,000 in 2023. To better understand the long-term trend, a 3-year moving average was calculated, revealing a long-term upward trend in the incidence rate. The Theil-Sen method confirmed that this upward trend is statistically significant (MAD = 2.202, V-value = 54, p < 0.01). Detailed results are presented in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Incidence Rate and Moving Average line graph of influenza incidence from 2018 to 2023 in Xinjiang.Full size imageThe thematic maps of influenza incidence in 96 counties of Xinjiang from 2014 to 2023 show the influenza incidence rates across the entire region. From 2014 to 2017, the incidence rates in various counties were generally low, mostly below 20 per 100,000, and remained at that level, especially in southern Xinjiang where the rates remained low with little variation. Starting in 2018, the incidence rates in counties located in northern and eastern Xinjiang began to rise steadily, exceeding 50 per 100,000, until they started to decline in 2021. However, in 2023, the incidence rates increased significantly again, affecting the entire region, especially in northern Xinjiang. Five counties in Urumqi City (Tianshan, Toutunhe, Terrazzo, Xinshi, Shaybak), two counties in Altay Region (Burqin, Hoboksar), as well as Yizhou in Hami Region and Yanqi in Bayingolin Region had incidence rates exceeding 500 per 100,000. Detailed results are presented in Fig. 2.Fig. 2The thematic maps of influenza incidence from 2018 to 2023 in Xinjiang.Full size imageSpatial correlation analysisThe global spatial autocorrelation analysis of influenza incidence rates in 96 counties of Xinjiang shows that, except for the years 2014, 2015, and 2017, the incidence rates from 2014 to 2023 exhibited positive spatial autocorrelation.The Moran’s I values were all greater than 0, with P values less than 0.05.The strongest clustering occurred in 2023, followed by 2021. Detailed results are presented in Table 1. The local spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted for influenza incidence rates from 2018 to 2023, which exhibited positive spatial autocorrelation. Significant clustering patterns were identified. In northern Xinjiang, the predominant patterns were high-high clustering and low-high clustering, while in Southern Xinjiang, low-low clustering predominated. The number of high-high clustering patterns observed each year increased from 3 to 16, indicating a strengthening of local spatial relationships and an increased influence of influenza incidence rates among counties. See Fig. 3 for details.Table 1 Global spatial autocorrelation of influenza incidence from 2014 to 2023 in Xinjiang (1/100,000).Full size tableFig. 3The LISA cluster maps of influenza incidence from 2018 to 2023 in Xinjiang.Full size imageHotspot analysisThe results of the hotspot analysis of influenza incidence in 2018–2023 showed that hotspot areas were identified in 22, 34, 16, 38, 30 and 34 counties for each respective year. These hotspots were mainly concentrated in northern Xinjiang, particularly in three regions: Urumqi, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, and Hotan Prefecture, accounting for 72.73%, 64.71%, 50%, 55.26%, 63.33%, and 64.71% of the total hotspots for each year, respectively. The hotspot areas increasingly concentrated in northern Xinjiang from 2018 to 2023. Additionally, the number of hotspot counties exhibited a fluctuating upward trend, indicating an increasing trend in influenza incidence rates in northern Xinjiang and an expanding trend. See Fig. 4 for detailed information.Fig. 4Hot sports of influenza incidence from 2018 to 2023 in Xinjiang.Full size imageStandard deviation ellipse analysis and gravity center migrationThe standard deviation ellipses, centered around the influenza incidence gravity center for each respective year. In 2018, the standard deviation ellipse covered the largest area, encompassing almost all of northern Xinjiang and parts of southern Xinjiang, indicating widespread transmission. In 2019, the standard deviation ellipse significantly shrank, concentrating in northern Xinjiang, suggesting a more localized spread. From 2020 to 2022, the standard deviation ellipse gradually elongated amid fluctuations, reflecting the further expansion of the influenza transmission range. In 2023, the standard deviation ellipse slightly decreased in size but remained highly concentrated in northern Xinjiang, indicating a significant clustering effect in influenza incidence in this region.The trajectory of influenza incidence gravity center migration in Xinjiang from 2018 to 2023 reflects the spatial evolution process of influenza development and diffusion in the region. In 2018, the gravity center of influenza incidence was located in Hejing County, in the central region of northern Xinjiang. In 2019, the gravity center shifted eastward by 134.55 km to Changji City, indicating a trend of influenza incidence spreading eastward. In 2020, the gravity center moved further northwest by 85.71 km to Shawan County, showing an expanded transmission range in northern Xinjiang. In 2021, the gravity center continued to move north by 50.31 km to Manas County, reflecting a significant increase in influenza incidence in the northern region. In 2022, the gravity center shifted back to Hejing County, moving 118.24 km, indicating repeated fluctuations of the epidemic between northern and eastern Xinjiang. In 2023, the gravity center moved northeast again by 122.84 km to Manas County, reflecting a continued high incidence of influenza in northern and eastern Xinjiang. Overall, from 2018 to 2023, the gravity center of influenza incidence remained in northern Xinjiang, moving from Hejing County (115.5020° N, 43.2640° E) northeast to Hutubi County (86.3827° N, 43.7019° E), with a direct movement distance of 141.31 km. Each year, the incidence gravity center shifted around Urumqi and its surrounding areas. See Fig. 5 for detailed information.Fig. 5Gravity center of influenza incidence from 2018 to 2023 in Xinjiang.Full size imageDiscussionBetween 2014 and 2023, the incidence rate of influenza in Xinjiang exhibited significant fluctuations, with an overall upward trend (MAD = 2.202, p < 0.01). From 2014 to 2018, the incidence rate remained low, below 30 per 100,000. However, in 2019, it surged to 88.80 per 100,000, an increase of 241.41%. During the period from 2020 to 2022, the incidence rate of influenza significantly decreased to between 7.78 per 100,000 and 20.06 per 100,000. This significant decline in influenza incidence during this period is likely because both COVID-19 and influenza are respiratory diseases. Multiple studies conducted during this time showed that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented to control COVID-19, such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and enhanced hygiene practices, effectively reduced the incidence of influenza12,13. In regions where lockdown measures were implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the reduction in influenza incidence was particularly noticeable. For instance, one study indicated that influenza incidence decreased by 79-fold after nine months of lockdown14.However, in 2023, the incidence rate of influenza sharply rebounded to 234.61 per 100,000, marking a 164.20% increase from 2019 and a 1321.88% increase from 2022. This significant rebound occurred in contrast to the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that the relaxation of COVID-19 preventive measures led to increased opportunities for influenza virus transmission15. In the post-pandemic era, it is imperative to guard against the alternating or simultaneous epidemic trends of various respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, influenza, and pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae16.According to the global spatial autocorrelation analysis, the influenza incidence rate in Xinjiang exhibited positive spatial correlation in 2016 and from 2018 to 2023. The local spatial autocorrelation analysis from 2018 to 2023 revealed distinct clustering patterns in different regions of Xinjiang. In northern Xinjiang, the predominant patterns were high-high clustering (HH) and low-high clustering (LH), while in southern Xinjiang, low-low clustering (LL) was more common. The high-high clustering in northern Xinjiang indicates that counties with high influenza incidence rates are surrounded by neighbors also experiencing high rates, suggesting strong local transmission. The low-high clustering indicates that counties with low influenza incidence rates are surrounded by neighbors with high rates, implying potential risk areas. There was a fluctuating upward trend in the number of high-high clusters, increasing from 3 in 2018 to 16 in 2023, a rise of 433.33%. This indicates a strengthening of local spatial relationships and an increased influence of influenza incidence rates among counties.The hotspot analysis results corroborate this finding, showing a fluctuating upward trend in the number of influenza hotspots, with hotspot counties increasing from 22 in 2018 to 34 in 2023, a rise of 54.55%. These hotspots were primarily concentrated in Urumqi, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, and Hotan Prefecture. This indicates that the high prevalence of influenza is in northern Xinjiang, with an increasing and expanding trend in incidence rates.Throughout 2018 to 2023, the gravity center of influenza incidence remained in northern Xinjiang, shifting between five counties: Hejing County, Changji City, Hutubi County, Manas County, and Shawan County. The incidence rates in northern Xinjiang increased rapidly, leading to an overall southwest to northeast shift in the gravity center. The standard deviation ellipses exhibited a northeast-southwest pattern, with its area fluctuating over time, reflecting the degree of concentration of influenza incidence. These results further indicate significant differences in incidence rates between counties in northern and Southern Xinjiang. Overall, the incidence rates in northern Xinjiang were significantly higher than those in Southern Xinjiang, making it a hotspot and primary region for the migration of the incidence center. The spread of influenza in northern and eastern Xinjiang showed a trend of continuous expansion. Over six years, the center of influenza incidence gradually moved towards Urumqi and its surrounding areas. Particularly in 2023, the influenza incidence in northern Xinjiang became more concentrated.Spatiotemporal analysis techniques have significant advantages in revealing the development trends of influenza epidemics and accurately predicting risks17. By analyzing the dynamic changes of influenza in temporal and spatial dimensions, high-risk areas and potential development trends can be accurately identified18. In-depth studies at the county level are of great importance for improving the precision and effectiveness of influenza prevention and control. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal evolution of influenza incidence rates at the county level in Xinjiang, further highlighting the critical role and practical utility of spatiotemporal analysis in epidemic prevention and control.This study reveals that influenza in Xinjiang is on the rise, with an accelerated growth rate in the post-pandemic era. Spatial analysis methods have identified northern Xinjiang as a high-risk area for influenza, showing an increasing trend in incidence and spread. The significant difference in influenza outbreaks between northern and southern Xinjiang may be attributed to various social factors, including population density, medical resources, and transportation accessibility19. Studies have shown that areas with higher population density and better transportation networks tend to experience higher rates of influenza transmission20,21.Xinjiang, divided into northern and southern regions by the Tianshan Mountains, exhibits significant climatic differences. The climate in northern Xinjiang is colder and more humid, which are driving factors for influenza epidemics22. Studies have shown that colder temperatures and higher humidity can facilitate the spread of influenza viruses by promoting virus stability and transmission23,24. Additionally, this may suggest that potential epidemics in southern Xinjiang have not yet been detected.Therefore, the prevention and control of influenza in Xinjiang require the formulation of differentiated and precise prevention strategies based on the clustering patterns and spatiotemporal characteristics of different regions. Northern Xinjiang is a high-incidence area for influenza, thus requiring more prevention and control resources to address this challenge. Measures such as increasing vaccine supply, strengthening the construction of medical facilities, and enhancing the professional capabilities of healthcare workers are necessary25,26. Additionally, targeted health education activities should be conducted to improve public awareness and prevention of influenza. Although the incidence rate of influenza in southern Xinjiang is relatively low, there still exists a certain level of risk, necessitating the establishment of a more comprehensive influenza monitoring system27 to promptly detect and respond to potential influenza outbreaks. By strengthening influenza prevention and control efforts in northern Xinjiang, enhancing influenza monitoring capabilities in southern Xinjiang, and addressing issues related to the allocation of medical resources between the two regions, we can better address public health challenges posed by influenza epidemics and ensure the health and safety of the people.This study primarily conducted spatial description and analysis of influenza incidence rate data. However, it is worth noting that the study did not delve into the various factors influencing influenza incidence rates, resulting in a significant deficiency in causal analysis. The causes of influenza incidence are complex and diverse, potentially including environmental factors, socioeconomic conditions, population structure, distribution of medical resources, and other aspects. Future research should expand in this area to achieve a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the epidemiological patterns of influenza. Additionally, this study was limited to the geographic scope of Xinjiang, which somewhat restricted the study’s generalizability. Given the vast territory and uneven population distribution in Xinjiang, there may be significant differences in influenza incidence rates across different regions. Therefore, future research could consider expanding the study scope to cover the entire country or more regions. Moreover, at the county level, research units could be further refined to the level of streets or communities to enhance the study’s generalizability and representativeness. This approach would be more conducive to revealing the epidemiological characteristics of respiratory diseases such as influenza, thereby providing a more scientific and accurate basis for the formulation of prevention and control measures.ConclusionsThis study presents a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of influenza incidence in Xinjiang from 2014 to 2023 using GIS technology. The findings highlight significant fluctuations in influenza incidence rates over the study period, with notable increases observed in 2019 and 2023. Spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed a spatially positive correlation of influenza incidence rates, with increasing high-high clustering areas. Hotspot analysis indicated a progressive rise in the number of influenza incidence hotspots, primarily concentrated in northern Xinjiang. The centroid migration analysis showed a consistent movement of the influenza incidence centroid towards northern Xinjiang, reflecting a higher incidence rate in this region. Moreover, the study underscores the importance of strengthening influenza prevention and control measures, particularly in high-risk areas such as northern Xinjiang, while also emphasizing the need to enhance influenza surveillance capabilities in southern Xinjiang. These insights contribute to a better understanding of influenza epidemiology and provide valuable guidance for public health interventions and resource allocation strategies to mitigate the impact of influenza epidemics in Xinjiang and beyond. Further research is warranted to delve deeper into the multifaceted factors influencing influenza incidence rates and to broaden the geographical scope of analysis for more comprehensive insights.

The simultaneous development of symptoms, the spokesperson said, doesn’t provide evidence of person-to-person spread.Additionally, a second close contact — a health care worker — subsequently developed mild symptoms and tested negative for influenza.The household contact’s symptoms “should have been mentioned” in a briefing Thursday, the spokesperson said, along with the additional context “to fully highlight all available information about the case and to further demonstrate why CDC hasn’t changed its risk assessment.”During the Thursday briefing, CDC officials they had yet to identify “a clear source” of infection in the Missouri patient, who was hospitalized on Aug. 22 and has since recovered.Since March, there have been 13 bird flu infections in poultry and dairy workers amid an outbreak of H5N1 spreading rapidly in dairy cows across 200 dairy herds in 14 states, according to the CDC.The patient was hospitalized, officials believe, not because of the infection but because of the patient’s underlying medical conditions. Officials declined to say what those conditions were, as that would involve disclosing private health information.The patient had chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and weakness — symptoms that were not initially linked to influenza, Dr. Nirav Shah, the CDC’s principal deputy director, said on the call Thursday, though a flu test was later administered. The patient, who wasn’t severely ill and didn’t require intensive care, was treated with an antiviral.Missouri state health officials are still investigating the case. While the patient was reported to have had no contact with animals, public health officials are now carrying out more detailed interviews, asking about wild birds or animals seen around the patient’s house or the use of bird feeders. They’re also asking about the type and source of meat and dairy the patient consumed, including any raw dairy.There is no evidence of the virus spreading from person to person, Shah said. So far, officials have identified no additional cases. There has also been no indication of increased rates of flu in the area where the patient lives.“Our investigation is not over,” Shah said Thursday. “We are beyond the typical 10-day window for transmission, and so with each passing day, the likelihood of this being something that’s happening deep underwater goes down.”Officials maintain that the risk to the general population remains low.“We assess risk continuously with every case and with every sort of change, and we continue to look at it as low,” Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on the call.Shah said that the case may be a “one-off,” meaning it didn’t spread beyond the patient.“Those do happen with novel influenzas,” he said, adding that so far this year, there have been a handful of swine flu cases that haven’t spread beyond a single individual.No bird flu infections in dairy cattle have been reported in Missouri, state health officials said in a release last week. There have been some cases reported in commercial poultry or backyard flocks and wild birds, they said. No additional human cases have been identified.Officials are also looking for any changes in the H5N1 virus that may suggest an increased potential for human-to-human spread. None have been found so far.Shah noted that the infection was detected thanks to Missouri’s influenza surveillance program.Berkeley Lovelace Jr.Berkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.

Before March 2024, H5N1 had not been detected in 1,337 wastewater samples analyzed by the team, a press release from UTHealth Houston said. From March 4 to July 15 of this year, H5N1 was detected as part of the virome (collection of viruses present in wastewater sample) in 10 of 10 cities, 22 of 23 sites (96%), and 100 of 399 samples (25%). "The abundance of H5N1 sequences identified has not correlated with influenza-related hospitalizations, which declined in Texas during the spring of 2024," the authors wrote. Overall risk still low Texas was the first state this year to confirm an H5N1 case, which involved an agricultural worker on March 28. The case-patient, who presented with conjunctivitis, among other mild symptoms, was exposed to symptomatic cattle. Since that detection, 13 other human US cases have been recorded, and all patients have made recoveries. "The widespread detection of influenza A(H5N1) virus in wastewater from 10 U.S. cities is troubling," the authors concluded. "Although the exact origin of the signal is currently unknown, the lack of clinical burden along with genomic information suggests multiple animal sources."The lack of clinical burden along with genomic information suggests multiple animal sources.Despite the findings, the risk to human health without direct contact with infected cattle like remains low, the authors said. Emergent BioSolutions awarded BARDA contract for Ebola treatment News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Emergent BioSolutions today announced that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, has awarded the company a research and development option worth $41.9 million to its existing contract to further the development and scale-up of its monoclonal antibody treatment for Ebola virus infection. Yaroslav Kryuchka / iStock The 10-year contract for the drug known as Ebanga (ansuvimab-zykl or mAb114) was initially awarded by BARDA in August 2023. According to a company statement, the contract option will cover drug substance engineering and scale-up process validation, long-term stability, and commercial readiness in support of its ongoing program for Ebanga. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug, given as a single infusion, in December 2020 for the treatment of Ebola Zaire virus disease. The BARDA activities are part of plan to deploy treatments that can be deployed in outbreaks. The drug was initially developed by Ridgeback Biotherapeutics with support from BARDA. Ridgeback and Emergent signed an agreement that allows Emergent to make and distribute the drug in the United States and Canada. IDSA, ESCMID call for 'robust action' on antimicrobial resistance ahead of UN meeting News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship TopMicrobialStock / iStock The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) are calling for world leaders to take "robust action" to mitigate the impact of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).In a joint white paper published yesterday in CMI Communications, IDSA and ESCMID experts urged world leaders attending the upcoming United Nations (UN) High-Level Meeting on AMR to adopt a political declaration with "bold targets and practical steps" to accelerate progress against drug-resistant bacteria across the human, animal, agricultural, and environmental sectors. "To truly propel consequential, sustainable progress against AMR, the UN political declaration must include bold targets and be accompanied by robust financing," the groups wrote. "We urge all participants to agree on a global commitment to scale up action commensurate with the present threat of AMR, with the aim to reduce the global deaths caused by AMR by 10 percent by 2030."Targets on antibiotic use, infection controlAmong the targets recommended by IDSA/ESCMID to achieve that goal is for 70% of all antibiotic use globally to be from the group of antibiotics that the World Health Organization (WHO) defines as Access antibiotics—first- and second-line antibiotics with a narrow spectrum of activity that offer high therapeutic value with lower potential for resistance. They also call for a 30% reduction in the quantity of antibiotics used in the agri-food system.To prevent the infections that drive global use of antibiotics, the groups say world leaders should set a goal of reaching 14 million children globally with essential immunization services, commit to scaling up implementation of the WHO's infection prevention and control guidelines to ensure that all nations have the core components in place, and improve access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene.We urge all participants to agree on a global commitment to scale up action commensurate with the present threat of AMR, with the aim to reduce the global deaths caused by AMR by 10 percent by 2030.Other recommendations include rebuilding the antimicrobial drug pipeline, with a focus on developing a sustainable innovation ecosystem that can deliver drugs that target multidrug-resistant bacteria, strengthening and scaling up global AMR surveillance systems, and establishing an independent scientific panel for AMR mitigation."We strongly encourage them to work with our societies to help provide the scientific basis to guide this important work," they wrote. Novel antifungal candidate gets financial boost News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Fungal Infection UK-based biopharmaceutical company F2G today announced a $100 million financing round to advance late-stage development and commercialization of olorofim, a novel oral antifungal therapy for invasive aspergillosis and other invasive fungal infections.Olorofim is the leading candidate from the orotomide class of antifungals, which work through a different mechanism of action than existing antifungal medications. It's currently being investigated in a phase 2b study in patients who have limited treatment options for rare and difficult-to-treat invasive fungal mold infections such as azole-resistant aspergillosis. Olorofim has received orphan drug status from the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation by the FDA."This is a pivotal period for the company as we conclude the final stages of development and preparation for commercialization of olorofim in the US and elsewhere," F2G CEO Francesco Maria Lavino, MBA, said in a company press release. "If approved, olorofim is expected to be the first of a new class of antifungal agents with a novel, differentiated mechanism of action and will address genuine unmet needs in conditions with high morbidity and mortality."An 'urgently needed' therapyThe financing round is being led by the AMR Action Fund, which was launched in 2020 with the aim of investing $1 billion to bring new antibiotics and antifungals to the market. AMR Action Fund CEO Henry Skinner, PhD, will join the F2G board of directors."For decades, clinicians have relied on a handful of antifungal classes, with few mechanisms of action and significant limitations due to spectrum of activity, drug toxicities, or drug-drug interactions," Skinner said. "These therapies are increasingly failing in patients. We are thrilled to support F2G’s team as they develop this urgently needed therapy and seek regulatory approval."

Interim data indicated that the vaccine candidates have an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile for all mRNA formulations assessed. This data suggested GSK4382276A’s potential for improved immune responses against influenza A and B strains compared to current vaccines. GSK’s findings build upon earlier research from another Phase II trial and confirm that the mRNA platform can produce strong antibody responses while maintaining a favourable safety profile. Following these results, the company plans to advance the GSK mRNA seasonal influenza vaccine programme into late-stage clinical development. GSK previously entered into a licensing agreement with CureVac, which granted GSK full rights to develop and manufacture influenza and Covid-19 vaccine candidates. GSK is also investing in advanced technologies, such as AI/ML-based sequence optimisation and nanoparticle design, to streamline its mRNA vaccine manufacturing processes. GSK chief scientific officer Tony Wood said: “This marks a significant advancement in our mRNA programme, and these data support moving into late-stage development. “Ultimately, our goal is to develop a new best-in-class vaccine to bring greater protection to people through the influenza season.” The latest development comes after the company announced that Part II of the Phase I/II TH HSV REC-003 trial of its therapeutic herpes simplex virus (HSV) vaccine candidate, GSK3943104, did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint. mRNA vaccine coverage on Pharmaceutical Technology (Or Clinical Trials Arena) is supported by Trilink.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the occurrence rate of pneumothorax in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and compare the risk of pneumothorax between patients with COVID-19 and influenza. This retrospective cohort study used patient data from the National Health Insurance Service of South Korea. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (December 2019 to December 2021) and influenza (January 2019 to December 2021) who required hospitalization and respiratory support were included. We identified 46,460 patients with COVID-19 and 6,117 with influenza. The occurrence rate of pneumothorax was 0.74% in patients with COVID-19. In an inverse probability of treatment weighting matched cohort, the Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that COVID-19 was not associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax compared to influenza (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–1.99). However, the risk of pneumothorax associated with COVID-19 compared to influenza was significantly higher in patients without chronic lung disease than in those with (P for heterogeneity = 0.037). In conclusion, COVID-19, compared with influenza, is not associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax; however, it is associated with an increased risk in patients without chronic lung disease.

Pneumothorax is more common in patients with underlying respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and lung infections, resulting from communication between the damaged alveolar spaces and the pleura1.As of March 2023, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in over 670 million cases and approximately 6.8 million deaths worldwide2. During the COVID-19 pandemic, pneumothorax has been reported as a frequent complication in COVID-19 pneumonia, which is associated with an increased risk of mortality3,4,5. The occurrence rate of pneumothorax in patients with COVID-19 varies considerably across studies, ranging from 5–24% in mechanically ventilated patients6 and 0.7–1% in hospitalized patients7,8.Although several studies have highlighted frequent pneumothorax in patients with COVID-19, comparisons with relevant controls are limited and have reported inconsistent results9,10,11,12,13. Additionally, multiple cases of pneumothorax have been documented in patients with influenza, a virus that, like COVID-19, primarily causes respiratory tract infections14. Consequently, it remains unclear whether the increased susceptibility to pneumothorax in patients with COVID-19 reflects a specific trait of COVID-19 or is merely a consequence of the very high prevalence of pneumonia during the short period of the pandemic.To address this unresolved issue, we leveraged nationwide claims data from South Korea. We selected influenza pneumonia as a harmonized control group to compare with COVID-19. Our aim was to assess the occurrence rate of pneumothorax in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia and determine whether COVID-19 pneumonia influences the risk of pneumothorax compared to influenza pneumonia.ResultsStudy population and baseline characteristicsDuring the study period, 325,990 patients were hospitalized for COVID-19, of whom 46,477 (14.3%) received respiratory support. After excluding 17 patients who did not meet inclusion criteria, the remaining eligible 46,460 patients formed the COVID-19 group (mean [standard deviation, SD] age, 62.5 [17.0] years; 24,597 males [52.9%]). A total of 90,330 patients with influenza were hospitalized during the study period, and 6,118 received respiratory support. After excluding one patient who did not meet the inclusion criteria, the remaining 6,117 patients formed the influenza group (mean [SD] age, 73.0 [15.3] years; 2,801 males [45.8%]) (Fig. 1 and Table 1).Figure 1Study flow. COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; IPTW, inverse probability of treatment weighted.Full size imageTable 1 Baseline characteristics of overall and inverse probability of treatment weighted cohorts.Full size tableThe COVID-19 group consisted of younger individuals with fewer comorbidities than the influenza group. Notably, the prevalence of chronic lung disease in the COVID-19 group was lower compared to the influenza group. Corticosteroid use was more common in the COVID-19 group. Conventional oxygen therapy was less frequent as the highest level of respiratory support during hospitalization, while high-flow nasal cannulation was more frequent in patients with COVID-19 than in those with influenza. After adjusting for inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), the cohort showed a good ability to balance the measured confounders between the COVID-19 and influenza groups, with most standardized mean differences (SMDs) < 0.1 after weighting, except for two variables: Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and the use of corticosteroids (Table 1).Development of pneumothoraxBefore IPTW matching, the occurrence rate of pneumothorax was 0.74% (343/46,460) in patients with COVID-19 and 0.49% (30/6,117) in those with influenza. The occurrence rates of pneumothorax based on the level of respiratory support are presented in Supplementary Table S1.After IPTW matching, the occurrence rate of pneumothorax was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group compared to the influenza group (0.72% [378/52,697] vs. 0.58% [286/49,295]; P = 0.007). Pneumothorax was more prevalent in the COVID-19 group than in the influenza group at all support levels (Table 2). Table 2 Primary outcome and outcomes of interest in IPTW-adjusted cohort.Full size tableHowever, the univariable Cox proportional hazard model, which accounts for the time elapsed until the pneumothorax occurrence, found no significant association between COVID-19 and the risk of pneumothorax (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–1.99, P = 0.414, Table 3). Among the patients who developed pneumothorax, the median duration of respiratory support before the development of pneumothorax was 0 days (interquartile range [IQR], 0–1) in both groups, showing that respiratory support and the development of pneumothorax occurred on the same day in most patients. Table 3 Cox proportional hazard model for pneumothorax in the IPTW-adjusted cohort.Full size tableSubgroup analysesThe associations of pneumothorax with COVID-19 compared to influenza were consistent across all subgroups but showed significant heterogeneity based on the presence of chronic lung disease (Fig. 2). The risk of pneumothorax associated with COVID-19, compared to that associated with influenza, was significantly higher in patients without chronic lung disease than in those with chronic lung disease (HR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.25–5.04 vs. 1.05, 95% CI, 0.58–1.93, P for heterogeneity = 0.037).Figure 2Subgroup analysis for pneumothorax in IPTW-adjusted cohort. IPTW, inverse probability of treatment weighted; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; CCI, Charlson comorbidity index.Full size imageIn-hospital mortalityBefore IPTW matching, in-hospital mortality was 5.00% (2,323/46,460) in patients with COVID-19 and 4.07% (249/6,117) in those with influenza (Supplementary Table S1). After IPTW matching, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group compared to the influenza group (7.1% [3,744/52,697] vs. 4.9% [2,428/49,295]; P < 0.001) (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S1). The univariable Cox proportional hazards model showed no association between COVID-19 and in-hospital mortality compared to influenza (HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.75–1.14]; P = 0.460, Supplementary Table S2). Delta variant and development of pneumothorax in COVID-19 patientsTo assess the association between the delta variant and the development of pneumothorax in patients with COVID-19, an unweighted Cox proportional hazards analysis was conducted on the initial study population with COVID-19 before IPTW matching (n = 46,460). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, controlling for confounding factors influencing pneumothorax, found no significant association between the delta variant and the development of pneumothorax (adjusted HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.72–1.14]; P = 0.403, Supplementary Table S3).DiscussionIn this retrospective cohort study using nationwide claims data from South Korea, the occurrence rate of pneumothorax, which required closed thoracostomy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients needing respiratory support, was 0.74%. In the IPTW-matched cohort, the rate of pneumothorax was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to those with influenza. However, the Cox proportional hazards regression model indicated that COVID-19 was not linked to an increased risk of pneumothorax compared to influenza. In a subgroup analysis, COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of pneumothorax in patients without chronic lung disease, compared to influenza.Multiple studies have reported that COVID-19 may increase the susceptibility to alveolar rupture, leading to pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or subcutaneous emphysema. However, studies reporting the occurrence rate of barotrauma, including pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema, have focused solely on patients with COVID-19, lacking a relevant control group. Studies have reported a higher occurrence rate of pneumothorax compared to the known 5–8% in non-COVID-19 acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) 15,16,17. Moreover, only a few studies have directly compared the occurrence rate of barotrauma between COVID-19 patients and controls9,10,13,18. Three studies utilized non-COVID-19 ARDS cases from the pre-pandemic period as a control group for COVID-19 ARDS9,10,13 and one study utilized patients without COVID-19 who visited the emergency department, irrespective of the reason for the visit as a control group for patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 in the emergency department18. Three studies found that the occurrence rate of barotrauma was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 compared to those without COVID-199,10,18. In contrast, one study reported no significant difference in the occurrence rate of barotrauma between the two groups13. Thus, the results of previous studies are, inconsistent. Furthermore, the non-COVID-19 patient group used as a control was notably heterogeneous. This raises questions about the appropriateness of control groups in such studies. Therefore, we selected patients who required respiratory support due to influenza as a control group to evaluate whether COVID-19 increases the risk of pneumothorax.Our results showed that COVID-19 was not linked to a higher risk of pneumothorax compared to influenza among general hospitalizations requiring respiratory support. However, in patients without pre-existing chronic lung disease, COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of developing pneumothorax. Chronic lung diseases, such as COPD, asthma, and emphysema, carry a high risk of spontaneous pneumothorax due to underlying alveolar damage19. While COVID-19 does not elevate the risk of pneumothorax in patients with pre-existing chronic lung disease, who already have an elevated risk, it does increase the risk in those without chronic lung disease. Consistent with our results, a prospective multicenter observational study of COVID-19 patients found that none of the 21 patients with spontaneous pneumomediastinum had COPD, whereas among 528 patients with spontaneous pneumomediastinum, 38 (7.2%) had COPD20. Additionally, Cai et al. found that chronic bronchitis and COPD were more prevalent in the group without pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum compared to the group with pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum group (4 (7.1%) vs. 13 (15.3%), P < 0.001)21.The increased risk of pneumothorax in COVID-19 patients can be attributed to self-inflicted lung injury from repeated excessive inspiratory efforts, which raise transpulmonary pressure more in COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID patients20,22,23,24. The exact pathophysiological mechanism behind the increased risk of pneumothorax in COVID-19 patients without chronic lung disease remains uncertain. However, it is plausible that patients without chronic lung disease, who generally have stronger inspiratory efforts, are more susceptible to this phenomenon in the context of COVID-19.In general, the occurrence of pneumothorax is lower in patients without chronic lung disease; however, this study demonstrated that in COVID-19 patients without chronic lung disease, the risk of pneumothorax is higher compared to those with influenza. Medical professionals should be aware of this elevated risk and engage in vigilant monitoring for the early detection and management of pneumothorax, especially in COVID-19 patients without chronic lung disease. Additionally, greater care should be given to implementing lung-protective ventilation strategies in this subgroup to prevent the occurrence of pneumothorax.In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen, systemic corticosteroid therapy improves clinical outcomes, presumably by mitigating systemic inflammatory responses, as recommended by the guidelines25,26. Conversely, in patients with influenza, corticosteroid use is known to contribute to increased mortality by hindering viral clearance27. Nevertheless, 17% of patients with influenza in our study were treated with corticosteroids before IPTW matching. Given the significant number of individuals with chronic lung disease (26.2% vs. 63.2%) in the influenza group, corticosteroids were presumably used to treat exacerbations of underlying lung diseases, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Due to their role in the inflammatory and healing processes, corticosteroids are associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax and prolonged air leak after developing pneumothorax28,29. Considering corticosteroids as drugs related to pneumothorax occurrence, we conducted a subgroup analysis based on corticosteroid use and found no significant interaction between COVID-19 and the development of pneumothorax according to corticosteroid use.This study had several strengths. First, utilizing South Korea’s insurance claims data enabled the enrolment of all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 or influenza who required respiratory support during the study period. This comprehensive approach ensures a broad and representative sample size. Second, we significantly reduced confounding factors by selecting influenza-infected patients as the control group for COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen treatment, thereby enhancing comparability between the groups.Nevertheless, this study also had some limitations. First, pneumothorax was defined based on the performance of closed thoracostomy. Cases in which a closed thoracostomy was not required were not considered; therefore, the incidence might have been underestimated. However, clinically significant cases involving air leaks that affect the prognosis typically require a closed thoracostomy. Thus, our definition encompassed the most clinically relevant instances of pneumothorax. Second, our study did not have information on ventilator settings, which could have contributed to an air leak by increasing the stress on the alveoli. However, previous studies have noted that most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who develop pneumothorax experience this complication despite receiving lung protective ventilation9,30,31. Third, potential intermediate factors in the causal pathway between exposure and outcome, such as maximal respiratory support and corticosteroid use, were included in the IPTW matching, which may introduce bias. Fourth, the respiratory support level used as a variable in IPTW matching was classified into four categories, and the low proportion of patients receiving higher levels of respiratory support could lead to overfitting. Finally, the absence of radiologic data and specific measures of respiratory dynamics in our analysis represents a limitation. Further research should focus on collecting detailed imaging findings and quantifying respiratory parameters to elucidate the mechanisms leading to pneumothorax in individuals with COVID-19.In conclusion, COVID-19, compared to influenza, was not associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax among hospitalized patients requiring respiratory support in general. However, our findings suggest that, in patients without pre-existing chronic lung disease, COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax compared with influenza.MethodsStudy design and populationThis retrospective cohort study used claims data provided by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) in South Korea. South Korea has implemented mandatory nationwide health insurance that covers 97% of its residents, with premiums adjusted based on income or property value. The remaining 3% residents who cannot afford premiums are covered by government-funded medical aid32. Therefore, using NHIS data, we analyzed almost the entire South Korean population.We defined patients with COVID-19 as those assigned with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) code U07.1 between December 2019 and December 2021. Patients with influenza were defined as those diagnosed with influenza using ICD-10 codes J09–J11 between January 2019 and December 2021. All consecutive adult patients (age ≥ 19 years) who were hospitalized for COVID-19 or influenza for at least 2 days with any respiratory support were included. Individuals who experienced pneumothorax within 30 days before COVID-19 or influenza infection were excluded (Fig. 1).Outcomes and variablesOur primary outcome was the development of pneumothorax requiring closed thoracostomy. Although the diagnosis of pneumothorax determined by the ICD codes is likely underreported, reimbursable procedures are precisely identifiable in the claims data. Therefore, we confined the outcomes to cases of pneumothorax that necessitated closed thoracostomy, which is a reimbursable procedure to treat pneumothorax. Data on in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, and duration of any respiratory support before pneumothorax were also collected as outcomes of interest.The following covariates were extracted: demographic information (age and sex), socioeconomic status (income level and residence), CCI calculated using the registered ICD-10 codes from 1 year before the diagnosis of COVID-19 or influenza, type of hospital, corticosteroid use, and level of respiratory support. We delineated two distinct periods to assess the impact of the COVID-19 variants: before the dominance of the delta variant in Korea (June 14, 2021) and thereafter (June 15, 2021).Statistical analysisBaseline characteristics are presented as means (SD) or medians (IQR) for continuous variables and as numbers (percentages) for categorical variables. We used IPTW analysis to adjust for potential confounding factors between COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia, which has an advantage over propensity score matching in that it retains more individuals (thus increasing its power) and estimates hazards with less bias33,34. The IPTW was calculated by considering the reciprocal probability of being in a group through logistic regression using the following covariates: age, sex, residence, income, comorbidities, CCI, type of hospital, use of corticosteroids, and level of respiratory support. Weight stabilization was used to reduce the impact of extreme weights. We assessed the balance of covariates before and after IPTW matching using absolute SMD and specified an SMD of ≤ 0.1 as a negligible difference between the two groups35.Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association between COVID-19, compared with influenza, and the development of pneumothorax and in-hospital mortality. We examined the proportional hazards assumption using Schoenfeld residuals for each covariate and did not observe any relevant violations. As weighting creates a pseudo-population containing replications of individuals, we used a robust sandwich variance estimator to correctly estimate the variance and CIs for the effect36.We performed a subgroup analysis to evaluate the association between COVID-19 (vs. influenza) and the development of pneumothorax in subgroups defined by sex, age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), chronic lung disease, CCI (0–2, ≥ 3), use of corticosteroids, and the various respiratory support modalities. Heterogeneity was tested across the subgroups. We used unweighted Cox proportional hazard regression to analyze the data of patients with COVID-19 before IPTW adjustment to evaluate how the delta variant of COVID-19 affected the likelihood of pneumothorax.All reported p-values were 2-tailed, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc.), and plots were generated using R software 4.0.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).EthicsThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (number: X-2305-826-903) on April 24, 2023.

Rob Coker | 09/12/2024 | 3 min read | News Research led by Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), published in Nature Communications, has explored the potential of a single, universal influenza vaccine, thanks largely to the insights provided by a hero of biomedical research: the Mauritian cynomolgus macaque. Credit: Pexels.comEach generation faces a deadly influenza pandemic, and the reasons why a universal vaccine has not yet been developed remain unknown. A vaccine that solves the viral sequence diversity and durable protection problems could open the door to a pandemic-free generation. With the aim of generating one, OHSU researchers immunized Mauritian cynomolgus macaques with cynomolgus vaccines expressing H1N1 to challenge avian H5N1 influenza. Six went unvaccinated, all dying within a week with acute respiratory distress. Of the 11 vaccinated, six macaques survived.What the researchers learned from this process is that survival correlates with the magnitude of the resident, influenza-specific CD4 + T cells that protect against highly pathogenic heterologous influenza. They are now inspired to explore further in the field of effector memory T cell-based vaccines as the search for a universal influenza vaccine goes on. However, biomedical research carries the onus of understanding and combating infectious diseases through the availability of reliable animal models. From murine to bovine, these animals have generated significant data, insights, and breakthroughs in understanding and curing disease. Perhaps none moreso, than the Mauritian cynomolgus macaque Mauritian cynomolgus macaques possess a more uniform genetic makeup than their Southeast Asian cousins. This homogeneity significantly enhances their value in research, reducing experimental variability and providing more consistent results. Such uniformity is particularly advantageous in infectious disease research.H5N1 is considered one of the most concerning strands of influenza, with a significant pandemic potential. While primarily affecting birds, H5N1 has shown the capacity to infect humans, notwithstanding its capacity to infect other species. Symptoms include severe respiratory issues and unusually high mortality rates for a flu-like virus – a major concern for world health authorities. In the study of H5N1, USOH scientists once again turned to the small primate as a critical model for understanding the pathogenesis of the virus, as well as the immune response it elicits. Their physiological and immunological responses closely resemble those of humans, making them an invaluable proxy in preclinical studies.

Selenium is one of the essential trace elements for the human body that possesses a good antiviral activity. In this study, we assessed anti-influenza A virus (H1N1) activity of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified gray selenium nanoparticles (PEG-SeNPs) on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells in vitro. CCK-8 assay showed that PEG-SeNPs had a protective effect on H1N1-infected MDCK cells. Moreover, PEG-SeNPs significantly reduced the mRNA level of H1N1. TUNEL-DAPI test showed that DNA damage reached a high level but effectively prevented after PEG-SeNPs treatment. Meanwhile, JC-1, Annexin V-FITC and cell cycle assay demonstrated the apoptosis induced by H1N1 was reduced greatly when treated with PEG-SeNPs. Furthermore, the downregulation of p-ATM, p-ATR and P53 protein, along with the upregualation of AKT protein indicated that PEG-SeNPs could inhibit H1N1-induced cell apoptosis through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated related signaling pathways. Finally, Cytokine detection demonstrated PEG-SeNPs inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory factors after infection, including IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6, and TNF-α. To sum up, PEG-SeNPs might become a new potential anti-H1N1 influenza virus drug due to its antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity.

Acute respiratory diseases caused by influenza viruses are highly contagious, but often self-limiting diseases4,5. However, in severe cases, the clinical manifestation may include respiratory, circulatory, and central system problems and even death6,7. Influenza virus is an RNA virus that belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family and has an envelope structure with radially arranged glycoproteins, including hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and matrix protein M28,9. Neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, and ion channels M2 blockers, like amantadine and rimantadine are the most common anti-influenza virus drugs used in clinical practice10. However, the latest studies have shown that these drugs may lead to certain adverse side effects, including damage to the gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, and peripheral nervous system11. In addition, a rapid mutation of the influenza virus and related site mutations may lead to drug resistance12,13 and difficult of vaccine development14. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new anti-influenza drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity.Over recent years, the combination of biotechnology and nanotechnology has promoted the widespread application of nanomedicine15,16. Selenium is an essential trace element necessary for humans and animals, and exhibits various biological functions in the body in the form of selenoprotein10,16,17,18. Moreover, selenium deficiency can induce cardiovascular19 and cerebrovascular diseases20, cancer21, nervous system diseases22, autoimmune diseases23 and is usually related to the incidence and mortality of viral infectious diseases24. So far, at least 30 viral infections have been linked to the host’s selenium nutritional status25. Previous studies have shown that selenium supplementation can balance the body’s redox and immune imbalance, inhibit virus replication, and alleviate viral diseases25,26. During the virus infection, excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) lead to DNA and/or protein damage, extensive mitochondrial oxidative damage, signal transduction, and cell apoptosis25,27,28. During past decades, selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have attracted much attention because of their antioxidant activity, unique biological activity, low toxicity, and nanomedicine applications29. Selenium, essential for a balanced diet, is absorbed in the intestines, metabolized into selenocysteine in the liver, and incorporated into selenoproteins such as SELENOP. SELENOP, released into the bloodstream, serves as a selenium source for tissues throughout the body30. Notably, SeNPs stand out among frequently studied nanoparticles like gold or silver nanoparticles due to the in vivo degradability of selenium31. Some studies have shown that SeNPs and selenocompounds have the ability to inhibit virus replication. It is reported that SeNPs are promising inhibitors for controlling influenza H1N1 virus infections as indicated by Su et al.32. Shao et al. founded that chitosan-coated selenium nanoparticles (CS-SeNPs) attenuate PRRSV replication and ROS/JNK-mediated apoptosis in vitro, suggesting the potential antiviral activity of CS-SeNPs33. Li et al. reported that Selenium–ruthenium complex blocks H1N1 influenza virus-induced cell damage by activating GPx1/TrxR134.Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is the most popular and widely-used biocompatible proetein-coupled polymer used for functionalized protein and peptide drug delivery35,36. PEG is also wildly applied in protein modification37,38. PEGylating conquers the problems of protein application, for example, rapid elimination in vivo, enzymatic degradation and immunogenicity39. PEG is safe to ingest through both oral and non-oral routes according to animal experiments and clinical trials35. However, there are only a few studies on the modification of PEG as a biologically active molecule, especially the direct nanometerization of PEG-modified selenium. Most research is focused on the oncological efficacy of PEG-SeNPs through its toxicity on cancer cells. For instance, it has been reported that the PEG-SeNPs had very low cytotoxicity in human kidney HK-2 cells while exhibiting a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on drug-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma cells (R-HepG2) to exert the anticancer effect31. Moreover, PEG-SeNPs modified with crocin demonstrated a great capability to reduce tumor growth in mice model40. Yet, the antiviral function of PEG-SeNPs still remains unexplored.In this study, we assessed the anti-H1N1 activity of PEG-modified gray Se nanoparticles (PEG-SeNPs) on MDCK cells in vitro. Our results indicated that PEG-SeNPs could be a potential new treatment strategy against the H1N1 influenza virus.ResultsEvaluation of the antiviral activity of PEG-SeNPsCCK-8 assay was used to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of PEG-SeNPs on the proliferation of MDCK cells infected with or without H1N1 virus. As shown in Fig. 1A, concentrations of 32 μM and above were toxic to the cells, and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) value was 53.58 μM. As shown in Fig. 1B, when the concentration is 4–16 μM, PEG-SeNPs inhibited viral activity, and the cell survival rate increased in a dose-dependent manner. The 50% maximal effective concentration (EC50) value was 4.30 μM and the selectivity index (SI) was CC50/EC50 = 53.58/4.30 = 12.46. Demonstrated in Fig. 1C and D, a significant reduction in virus titer was observed following PEG-SeNPs treatment, suggesting a good anti-H1N1 virus effect. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1E, the virus group showed cytopathic changes compared to the treatment group; the number of cells in the virus group was reduced, and the intercellular space was enlarged. To sum up, these results showed that PEG-SeNPs improve the survival rate of MDCK cells after H1N1 infection.Fig. 1The effects of different concentrations of PEG-SeNPs on MDCK cells with or without virus infection.

The expression of H1N1 mRNA was then detected using qPCR. Compare to the H1N1 group (100%), the expression of H1N1 mRNA was declined and the rate was decreased to 11.9% after treatment with PEG-SeNPs (Fig. 2). The result indicated that PEG-SeNPs inhibit virus replication, thereby improving cell proliferation and survival rates.Fig. 2The effects of SeNPs on virus proliferation.

Depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential is one of the early signs of cell apoptosis. This study used flow cytometry and fluorescence microscope to detect the mitochondrial membrane potential in different groups. In contrast to the control group, the mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced significantly to 35.5%, and 13.1% for the H1N1, and PEG-SeNPs + H1N1 group, respectively (Fig. 3A, B). Compared with other groups, the green fluorescence of the JC-1 monomer in the virus group increased, accompanied by the decreased red fluorescence of JC-1 aggregates (Fig. 3C). These results revealed that PEG-SeNPs could inhibit the membrane potential depolarization of H1N1 infected MDCK cells.Fig. 3PEG-SeNPs inhibited the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential caused by virus infection.

Compared with the virus group, the early and late apoptosis rates of the drug treatment group were both obviously decreased (Fig. 4A). In accordance with Fig. 4B, the total apoptosis rates of the control group, H1N1 virus group, PEG-SeNPs group, and H1N1 + PEG-SeNPs are 7.79%, 48.79%, 13.04%, 16%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4C, the red (propidium iodide positive cells) and green (Annexin V-FITC positive cells) fluorescence were the strongest in the virus group, which were reduced after treatment with PEG-SeNPs. These results indicated that PEG-SeNPs inhibited MDCK cells apoptosis induced by H1N1 infection.Fig. 4The effect of PEG-SeNPs on the translocation of phosphatidylserine induced by virus infection.

As shown in Fig. 5A, untreated cells were mainly distributed in the G0/G1 phase, while significant changes in the percentage of cells were observed in almost all G1, S, and G2/M phases in the virus-infected group. As indicated by Fig. 5B, the sub-G1 peak was significantly increased in H1N1 group, and the apoptosis rate reached 24.35%. There was no obvious apoptosis peak after 48 h of treatment of PEG-SeNPs, and the apoptosis rate was only 8.10%. These results proved that PEG-SeNPs could rescue MDCK cells apoptosis induced by the H1N1 virus.Fig. 5The effect of PEG-SeNPs on the apoptosis of MDCK cells infected by the H1N1 virus. (A) The sub-G1 apoptotic cell population in the control, H1N1, PEG-SeNPs, H1N1 + PEG-SeNPs group was 1.80%, 24.35%, 3.93%, 8.10%, respectively. (B) Cell cycle assay involved quantitative detection of DNA content by flow cytometry and the analysis of cell cycle distribution, especially the proportion of apoptosis peaks after different treatments. Experiments were repeated three times. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. # represents comparison with the control group, while * represents comparison with the virus group.Full size imagePEG-SeNPs inhibit DNA damage after virus infectionThe cell apoptosis was further verified by TUNEL and DAPI experiments. The fragmented DNA is stained green by TUNEL, while the cell nucleus is stained blue by PI solution. DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation were observed in MDCK cells after H1N1 infection (Fig. 6B), while the green fluorescence was weakened and the nuclear morphology changes were effectively prevented after PEG-SeNPs treatment. The mean green fluorescence intensity was analyzed by the Image J software. As shown in Fig. 6A, the mean green fluorescence intensity was decreased after PEG-SeNPs treatment. These results further indicated that PEG-SeNPs rescued the apoptosis of H1N1 infected MDCK cells.Fig. 6DNA fragmentation and nuclear coagulation examined using TUNEL-DAPI staining. (A) Compared to H1N1 group, the mean green fluorescence intensity was significantly reduced after PEG-SeNPs treatment. (B) Apoptotic cells were positively stained by TUNEL green fluorescence. Experiments were repeated three times. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. # represents comparison with the control group, while * represents comparison with the virus group.Full size imagePEG-SeNPs inhibited the production of reactive oxygen speciesROS is the class of active molecules with high oxidative activity, mainly including free radicals, oxygen ions, and peroxides41. The production of ROS often occurs after viral infection. Excessive ROS induces oxidative stress and enhances virus replication25. Mitochondria are the main source of ROS within cells, which are often detected by the fluorescent dye DHE. Compared with the control group, the relative levels of ROS in the H1N1 group, the PEG-SeNPs group, and the H1N1 + PEG-SeNPs group were 265%, 105%, and 125%, respectively (Fig. 7). The H1N1 group has the strongest DCF green fluorescence, while the H1N1 + PEG-SeNPs group was significantly weak. Therefore, we concluded that PEG-SeNPs might inhibit the virus-induced ROS production.Fig. 7PEG-SeNPs inhibited the production of ROS induced by the virus. (A) The reactive oxygen levels of the H1N1 virus group, PEG-SeNPs, H1N1 + PEG-SeNPs group were 265%, 105%, 125%, respectively, compared with the control group (100%). Experiments were repeated three times. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. (B) The production of reactive oxygen species between different groups detected by a fluorescence microscope. # represents comparison with the control group, while * represents comparison with the virus group.Full size imagePEG-SeNPs inhibited the ROS mediated AKT, ATR, and P53 signal pathwaysDuring ROS-mediated oxidative stress, multiple signaling pathways are seen to have significant effects42. The mechanism of PEG-SeNPs against the H1N1 virus was further explored by detecting related apoptosis proteins. The C-PARP protein was increased in H1N1 infected cells, and the PEG-SeNPs could inhibit C-PARP protein expression. Besides, PEG-SeNPs downregulated p-ATM, p-ATR and P53 protein expression induced by H1N1 infection (Fig. 8). In contrast, PEG-SeNPs upregulated Bcl-2, PARP and AKT protein expression induced by H1N1 infection. These results indicated that the AKT, ATR, and P53 signaling pathways were involved in PEG-SeNPs mediated apoptosis inhibition.Fig. 8The protein expression of ATM, ATR, P53 and AKT by Western blot. PEG-SeNPs downregulated the protein expression including, p-ATM, p-ATR, P53, and C-PARP proteins. Meanwhile, PEG-SeNPs upregulated the protein expression of Bcl-2, AKT and PARP.Full size imagePEG-SeNPs can regulate the expression of cytokineWhile ROS production is an important defensive mechanism against flu viral infection, the overproduction of ROS stimulates pro-inflammatory mediators, thereby inducing cytokine storm, promoting viral replication, and subsequently resulting in body damage25,43. Xu et al. reported that cell apoptosis and inflammatory reactions occurred after EV71 virus infection44. In this study, the secretion of cytokines in the cell supernatant was detected by flow cytometry to analyze the effect of PEG-SeNPs on the inflammation after viral infection. Several cytokines, including Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin-5 (IL-5), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-α), increased in the virus group and were alleviated after PEG-SeNPs treatment (Fig. 9). These results indicated that PEG-SeNPs could inhibit the inflammation after viral infection. The schematic diagram illustrated the anti-apoptosis mechanism of PEG-SeNPs in the H1N1 virus infection (Fig. 10).Fig. 9The level of inflammatory factors after virus infection by flow cytometry. PEG-SeNPs suppressed the expression of inflammatory factors, including IL1β, IL-5, IL-6, and TNF-α. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. # represents comparison with the control group, while * represents comparison with the virus group.Full size imageFig. 10The schematic diagram of apoptosis signaling pathways participated in the inhibition of H1N1 by PEG-SeNPs. PEG-SeNPs inhibited H1N1-induced apoptosis and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.Full size imageDiscussionAs the widespread occurrence, significant harm, and the emergence of drug resistance are pressing concerns, there is an urgent need to develop new and effective anti-influenza drugs. Selenium, a vital trace element in the human body, has a long history of reducing the frequency and severity of viral infections45. Our research group conducted a screening of various selenium-containing compounds and found that PEG-SeNPs demonstrate notable effectiveness against influenza. In the current study, the anti‐influenza effect and underlying mechanism of PEG-SeNPs were explored. To evaluate therapeutic potency, the anti‐influenza effect was demonstrated by CCK-8 and PCR assay. The CCK-8 experiments indicate that PEG-SeNPs has minimal toxicity on MDCK cells but exhibits significant antiviral activity. Numerous studies proved that the PEG and SeNPs are safe in vivo and vitro31,35,40. Both our CCK-8 experiments result on MDCK cells line and the cytotoxicity result on normal kidney HepG2 cells in the previous study indicated the safety of PEG-SeNPs31. Furthermore, the inhibitory impact of PEG-SeNPs on viral amplification was directly evidenced through a PCR experiment targeting the Nucleoprotein (NP) gene of the H1N1 virus. Moreover, derived from the inhibitory effect of PEG-SeNPs on the H1N1 virus, the anti-influenza mechanism of PEG-SeNPs was further elucidated. PEG-SeNPs was newly recognized as a suppressor of apoptosis and inflammation related to oxidative damage caused by H1N1 virus.Apoptosis is one of the major ways of programmed cell death (PCD) after virus infection. Many studies have confirmed the close relationship between viral infection and apoptosis46,47. Some viruses exploit the induction of apoptosis as a means to release and disseminate progeny viruses48. Influenza A viruses affects various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, protein synthesis and apoptosis49. Our date showed that PEG-SeNPs inhibits mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by JC-1 assay. Moreover, PEG-SeNPs inhibited phosphatidylserine eversion in H1N1 infected MDCK cells was evidenced by Annexin V-PI assay. JC-1 is a fluorescent dye widely utilized for assessing mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). A reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential is a key event in the early stages of apoptosis. Annexin V is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that can specifically bind to phosphatidylserine (PS) exposed on the outer side of the cell membrane. When used in conjunction with propidium iodide (PI), it enables the differentiation between early apoptotic, late apoptotic, and dead cells. In our manuscript, compared to the control group, the mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced significantly to 35.5%, and 13.1% for the H1N1, and PEG-SeNPs + H1N1 group, respectively (Fig. 3A, B). In Fig. 4A and B, the early apoptosis rate is 4.47%, 24.59%, 8.11% and 13.51% for the Control, H1N1, and PEG-SeNPs + H1N1 group, respectively. The results from the JC-1 and Annexin V-PI assays in our manuscript are generally consistent in detecting early apoptosis. The discrepancies observed may be attributed to the different detection mechanisms of these methodologies. In addition, it was also proved that PEG-SeNPs could rescue MDCK cells apoptosis induced by the H1N1 virus through cell cycle analysis. DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation were observed in MDCK cells after H1N1 infection by TUNEL and DAPI experiments. TUNEL and DAPI staining assays further evidenced the cell apoptosis mediated by H1N1 were inhibited by PEG-SeNPs. In general, PEG-SeNPs significantly reduced both the early and late apoptosis rates caused by H1N1 virus.Furthermore, in our study, the mechanism of PEG-SeNPs inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis during infection is conducted to explore. In our study, PEG-SeNPs effectively inhibited the production of reactive oxygen species in H1N1-infected MDCK cells. ATM and ATR are central proteins in the DNA damage response pathway. The Ser15 residue of the p53 protein can be activated by both ATM and ATR, both in vivo and in vitro50. Bcl-2 is a protein connected to the outer membrane of mitochondria, which inhibits cell apoptosis. Under the stimulus of apoptosis, the Bax/Bcl-2 heterodimer reduces Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP), increases membrane permeability, and releases cytochrome c, thereby activating the caspase enzyme family. P53 can downregulate the expression of Bcl-2 and jointly promote cell apoptosis51. In the present study, the expression levels of apoptosis signaling pathway-related proteins were detected. Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) is a DNA repair enzyme that plays a crucial role in DNA damage repair and apoptosis52. When cells experience stress-induced DNA damage, PARP becomes activated, either to engage in DNA repair or initiate DNA degradation. In this research, MDCK cells infected with the influenza virus exhibited elevated levels of PARP, which contributed to the promotion of DNA damage. However, treatment with SeD-3 effectively suppressed influenza virus-induced DNA damage and subsequent apoptosis. In our study, H1N1-infected cells exhibited a marked downregulation in the expression of apoptosis-related proteins such as ATM/ATR, AKT and PARP, along with a notable upregulation in the expression of P53 when compared to the control group. Several studies have also demonstrated that IVA infection leads to production of ROS, which promote apoptosis, lung injury, and inflammation53. Consistent with previous findings46, our study demonstrated H1N1 virus infection triggers the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, PEG-SeNPs effectively inhibited ROS production following H1N1 infection. Collectively, the results of our study demonstrated that PEG-SeNPs regulation on virus-induced cell apoptosis via Reactive Oxygen Species Mediated AKT, ATM/ATR, and P53 signaling pathways.Besides, ROS play a vital role in regulation of cytokines. ROS overproduction stimulates pro-inflammatory mediators, thereby inducing cytokine storm, promoting viral replication, and subsequently resulting in body damage25. IL-5 is a powerful pro-inflammatory cytokine. The localized activation of IL-1β stands as a pivotal step in mediating the pro-inflammatory response, leading to the subsequent activation of secondary inflammatory mediators, including IL-654. Similar to IL-1β, TNF-α is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine that belongs to the TNF ligand superfamily. TNF-α governs a wide array of functions, encompassing the regulation of various developmental and immune processes, including inflammation, differentiation, lipid metabolism, and apoptosis54,55. It is also linked to several diseases. In the present study, several cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6 and TNF-α, were increased in the virus group and decreased after PEG-SeNPs treatment. These findings suggested that PEG-SeNPs alleviated inflammatory damage.Materials and methodsMaterialsChloromethyl ketone (TPCK) (C0203), CCK-8 kit (Cell counting kit-8) (C0037), Fetal bovine serum (FBS) (C0234), Penicillin–Streptomycin Solution (100X) (C0222), Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) (C11995500BT), phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (ST478),propidium iodide (PI) (ST512), Enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential assay kit with JC-1(C2003S), Tunel-DAPI (C1098), Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit(C1062M), Neuraminidase assay kit(P0306), BCA Protein assay kit(P0012S) and ECL kit (P0018S) were acquired from Beyotime (Jiangsu, China).

PEG-SeNPs was kindly providing by Tianfeng Chen research group, College of Chemistry and Materials, Jinan University China. The specific physico-chemical properties of PEG-SeNPs are described in their previous report31. As reported in their previous work, the PEG-SeNPs has monodisperse spherical structures with an average core diameter of about 5 nm, and a hydrodynamic diameter of 28.7 ± 4.2 nm due to the PEG coating. PEG coating on SeNPs leads to an increase in particle size and a slight decrease in the magnitude of the negative zeta potential compared to uncoated SeNPs.Cell and virus cultureMDCK cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (CCL-34TM). Cells were cultured with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2/ 95% air at 37 °C.The H1N1 virus was obtained from the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center of Guangzhou Medical University. The H1N1 virus titer used in the whole experiment was 0.01 MOI. The cell infection procedure was the following: MDCK cells were infected with H1N1 at MOI = 0.01 for 2 h, and then washed with PBS three times to remove excess H1N1 virus. Finally, cells were cultured in a medium containing 2% serum and 2 μg/ml TPCK.To assess the antiviral activity of PEG-SeNPs, cells were subjected to H1N1 virus infection and treated with different concentrations of SeD‐3 over a 48-h period. Following the collection of culture supernatant, the H1N1 virus titer was determined through the measurement of TCID50.TCID50 assayThe MDCK cells were seeded into a 96-well flat- bottom plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. Then the virus solution is diluted tenfold, ranging from 10−1 to 10−10. The series of diluted virus solutions were sequentially inoculated into the 96-well plate with 100 μL in each well for 2 h. Eight replicate wells were prepared for each dilution. Finally, the virus solutions were removed, and the cells were cultured in the medium for daily monitoring under a microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany, DMi8) to observe cytopathic effect (CPE) appearance. The Reed-Muench method was used for calculating TCID50.Cell survival rate assaysThe CCK-8 assays were performed to detect cell proliferation and the antiviral activity of PEG-SeNPs as previously reported. MDCK cells were seeded in a 96‐well plate (1 × 105 cells/well) for 24 h and then treated with the H1N1 virus for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated with 100 μl of PEG-SeNPs of different concentrations (4–64 μM) for 48 h. Finally, 10 μl of the CCK-8 kit was added to each well and incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a multimode microplate reader (Thermo Scientific, Vantaa, Finland, Varioskan LUX)56.Virus proliferation after PEG-SeNPs treatmentThe mRNA level of H1N1 was detected by fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR as previously reported46. RNA extraction followed the instructions of the RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). The primers designed for the NP gene included a forward primer with the sequence 5′‐AGGATGTGCTCTGATGC‐3′ and a reverse primer with the sequence 5′‐TCTCACCCCTCCAGAAGTTC‐3′. For the GAPDH gene, the forward primer sequence was 5′‐CGCCAAGAAGGTGATCATTTC‐3′, and the reverse primer sequence was 5′‐CAGGAGGCGTTCGAGATGAC‐3′. Relative gene expression levels were calculated using the 2−△△Ct method with β-actin as control.Production of ROSThe ROS in cells were detected based on the principle that the non-fluorescent DCFH could be oxidized into a green fluorescent DCF by cellular ROS as previously described with modifications57. As mentioned above, the MDCK cells were incubated with the virus for 2 h, washed 3 times with PBS, and then added PEG-SeNPs. DCFH-DA was diluted with serum-free culture medium to a final concentration of 10 μmol/L. The cell culture medium in the 6-well plate was removed and incubated with 1 mL diluted DCFH-DA for 20 min at 37 °C. Finally, the cells were observed by a fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany, DMi8). Additionally, the fluorescence intensity was quantified by Multimode microplate reader (Thermo Scientific, Vantaa, Finland, Varioskan LUX) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm.JC-1 experimentThe transition of JC-1 from red fluorescence to green was used as a marker of early cell apoptosis. Briefly, cells were well mixed with 1 mL JC-1 working solution and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. During the incubation period, prepare 2 ml of JC-1 staining buffer (1X) by diluting JC-1 staining buffer (5X) with distilled 8 ml of distilled water. Place the prepared JC-1 staining buffer (1X) on ice. After the 37 °C incubation, aspirate the supernatant, and wash the cells twice with JC-1 staining buffer (1X). Subsequently, the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope with an excitation wavelength of 525 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm.Additionally, the cells from different treatment group were digested, collected, and stained with 0.5 ml of JC-1 working solution at 37 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was then discarded after centrifuging at 600 g 4 °C for 3–4 min. After washing the cells twice with JC-1 staining buffer (1X), the cells were then resuspended with JC-1 staining buffer and detected by a flow cytometer.Annexin V-FITC experimentThe Annexin V-FITC experiment was used to detect early and late apoptosis. H1N1 infected MDCK cells were treated with 2 ml of 16 nm PEG-SeNPs. The cells were then digested, collected, and stained with 195 μl of Annexin V-FITC binding solution, 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 10 μl of propidium iodide staining solution, respectively, at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. During the incubation process, cells were re-suspended 2–3 times to improve staining efficiency. The fluorescence was detected by flow cytometry after staining. In addition, for fluorescence microscope observation, the cells were centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min, collected, gently resuspended in 100 μl of Annexin V-FITC binding solution, and smeared onto a slide.Cell cycle experimentThe cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described42. H1N1 infected MDCK cells were treated with 2 ml of 16 nM PEG-SeNPs. After that, the cells were digested, collected, and washed once with PBS. They were then fixed with 70% pre-cooled ethanol at − 20 °C overnight. Then propidium iodide staining solution was prepared by combining 500 μl of staining buffer, 25 μl of propidium iodide (20 X), and 10 μl of RNase A per sample. Consequently, the fixed cells were washed with 1 ml PBS once and stained with 535 μl propidium iodide staining solution at 4 °C for 1 h in the dark. The fluorescence was detected by flow cytometry, and the cell cycle distribution, apoptotic cells with hypodiploid DNA content were analyzed by the Muliticycle software.TUNEL experiment and DAPI stainingThe DNA fragmentation of cells was evaluated by the TUNEL-DAPI experiment. Following the instructions of a TUNEL assay kit, cells in the 6-well plate were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, added PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, and finally stained with 100 μl of TUNEL detection solution for 1 h. The TUNEL detection solution was freshly prepared with 10 μl of TdT enzyme, 90 μl of Fluorescein-dUTP Labeling Solution per sample. After that, cells were added with 1ug/ml DAPI staining solution for 15 min, washed with PBS to remove the excess dye, and observed under a fluorescence microscope.Western blotThe expression of proteins were analyzed by western blot as previously reported58. The date of bands was showed in Supplementary material. Briefly, the cells were washed two times with PBS and then lysed on ice with RIPA lysis buffer containing 1% protease inhibitor. The protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA assay kit. Next, equal amounts of protein samples were separated by a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk- TBST solution for 1 h. After incubation with the primary and the secondary antibody, the bands were identified using chemiluminescence (ECL) kits and detected by Gel imaging system (Sage Creation, BeiJing, China, Mini Chemi610). The gray value of each strip was evaluated using Image J software. Subsequently, the gray value of actin was considered as 1, and the gray value of other strips was compared to it, resulting in a ratio. Finally, the control group was set as 1, and each group was compared to the control group.Cytokine detectionThe culture supernatant of MDCK cells was collected and the level of cytokine were detected as previously reported59. Each well was mixed with a 20 µl of capture microsphere mixture (vortex for 45 s before use), and then with 20 µl of sample diluent and 20 µl cell supernatant. After shaking and mixing, each well was then mixed with 20 μl of detection antibody mixture and incubated for 2 h in a shaker at room temperature the in dark. Subsequently, 20 μl of SA-PE was added to each well, followed by incubation at room temperature in the dark with shaking for 30 min. Afterward, the wells were washed twice with 200 μl of buffer. Finally, the supernatant was aspirated and 200 μl of buffer was added for resuspension. The cytokines were detected using a flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, CA, USA, BD FACSCANCO II). Data acquisition and cytokine analysis were used by BD FACSDiva and FCAP Array 3.0 analysis software, respectively (Supplementary material).Statistical analysisAll data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and analyzed by SPSS13.0 software. The difference among three groups or more was compared by analysis of variance, two-sided test. A P-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All experiments were repeated at least three times.ConclusionsIn summary, PEG-SeNPs shows a promising antiviral prospect. Furthermore, the underlying molecular mechanisms indicated that PEG-SeNPs effectively suppress H1N1 influenza virus-induced apoptosis through reactive oxygen species mediated AKT, ATM/ATR, and P53 signaling pathways. Additionally, PEG-SeNPs demonstrate the ability to alleviate inflammatory damage caused by the influenza virus. Cumulatively, the present study provides the possibility of using a nanosystem to inhibit H1N1 influenza virus-induced apoptosis and inflammation, thereby offering a novel strategy for potential anti-H1N1 influenza therapy.

It is designed to assess the vaccine’s safety and immune response, comparing the HD-MAP delivery to conventional injection methods. The company anticipates reporting the initial data from the trial next year. Vaxxas president and CEO David Hoey said: “Global pandemic threats require the world’s health organisations to have better and more accessible vaccine delivery options. With potential benefits such as thermostability, ease of use, and patient acceptability, Vaxxas’ HD-MAP is designed to be rapidly and broadly deployed to accelerate vaccination uptake and rates. “Market research indicates that, given the choice, vaccination by HD-MAP is significantly preferred over conventional needle-and-syringe.” In November last year, the company reported positive results from a Phase I clinical trial for the measles and rubella (MR) vaccine delivered using HD-MAP.

In the category of influenza-associated encephalopathy, acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rapidly progressive and fulminant brain disorder associated with significant neurological sequelae and mortality. To date, only a few adult cases of influenza-associated ANE have been reported. We describe a 44-year-old woman who presented with rapid progression of consciousness impairment and recurrent generalized convulsions. Influenza was diagnosed three days prior to presentation, and infection with influenza A (H3N2) pdm09 was subsequently confirmed. A diagnosis of ANE was made based on the presence of characteristic brain MRI findings, the exclusion of central nervous system infection, and an elevated serum interleukin-6 level. Pulse steroid therapy followed by tocilizumab was initiated, which led to clinical stabilization and improvement. Genetic testing revealed that the patient carried heterozygous human leukocyte antigen DQB1 03:03 and DRB1 09:01 genotypes. An analysis of the adult cases of influenza-associated ANE in the literature and the present case revealed a wide range of ages (22–71 years), a short interval (median 3 days) between the clinical onset of influenza and ANE, and a high overall mortality rate (32%). The thalamus was the most frequent (91%) location of the lesions. Our report highlights the importance of identifying this devastating but treatable neurological complication of influenza in adults, especially those of Asian descent. As a cytokine storm is the most accepted pathogenic mechanism for ANE, cytokine-directed therapies may be promising treatments for which further investigation is warranted. Peer Review reports BackgroundInfluenza is a highly contagious infectious disease that causes a substantial burden on health services. Seasonal epidemics of influenza lead to approximately one billion cases worldwide, including 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness associated with a death rate of up to 10% [1]. In Taiwan, the Center of Disease Control noted 3.5 to 9.5 influenza cases with severe complications per 100,000 people annually during the pre-COVID-19 epidemic era [2]. Moreover, influenza may be associated with diverse complications along the neuroaxis. The most common neurological complications are seizure and influenza-associated encephalopathy. Less common or rare conditions include meningitis, central nervous system demyelination, Reye syndrome, stroke, Guillain–Barré syndrome and myopathy [3, 4]. Influenza-associated neurological complications affect mainly pediatric patients, occurring in up to 7.6 to 16.9% of children hospitalized with influenza [3, 5,6,7]. Moreover, Asian race has been identified as a risk factor for the development of influenza-associated neurological complications [3].In the category of influenza-associated encephalopathy, acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare brain disorder characterized by multiple symmetric brain lesions, alterations in mental status with rapidly progressive neurological deterioration, and a high rate of significant neurological sequelae or mortality [8]. ANE usually develops following infection with various viruses, including influenza A and B, SARS-CoV-2, enterovirus, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and dengue virus, and rarely Mycoplasma pneumoniae [8]. However, there is little evidence of direct brain invasion by infectious pathogens. In some cases, ANE can occur spontaneously, recurs, or is associated with a family history, suggesting an underlying genetic predisposition [9]. In line with this, mutations in RANBP2 have been found to be linked to the development of a specific type of ANE that is named ANE1 [9].Since it was first described in Japanese children in 1995 [10], ANE has been found to predominantly affect the Asian pediatric population, especially those under 5 years of age [11]. In contrast, only a limited number of adult cases of influenza-associated ANE have been reported to date. Here, we report the case of an adult patient with ANE and antecedent infection with influenza A virus who subsequently received steroid and anticytokine treatment and survived. We also report our findings from a review of the literature on adult cases of influenza-associated ANE.Case presentationA 44-year-old Taiwanese female with a history of thyroid goiter had headache, fever, sore throat, cough and rhinorrhea in August 2023. She was diagnosed with influenza A infection through a rapid throat swab test on the third day of symptom presentation and was treated with inhaled zanamivir. The next day, she was sent to the emergency service because of sudden alterations in consciousness and recurrent tonic‒clonic seizure episodes. Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was E1V1M4, temperature was 37.2 °C, blood pressure was 112/52 mmHg, and heart rate was 95/min. Her blood leukocyte count was 7100/μL (neutrophil percentage = 87.7%), C-reactive protein level was 7.89 mg/L (normal < 5), aspartate aminotransferase level was 41 U/L (normal < 34), alanine aminotransferase level was 24 U/L (normal < 36), ammonia level was 72 μg/dL (normal < 96), and creatinine level was 0.61 mg/dL. Brain CT showed multiple subcortical hypodense lesions in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed one monocyte/μL, 1080 erythrocytes/μL, an elevated protein level (77 mg/dL), and normal glucose (84 mg/dL) and lactate (18.3 mg/dL) levels. She subsequently required endotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Lorazepam and levetiracetam (for status epilepticus), peramivir (for severe complicated influenza) and ceftriaxone (empiric antibiotic for suspected adult bacterial meningitis) were given.She was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit on Day 2 of the neurological episode. Electroencephalography demonstrated generalized continuous theta activity. Her neurological condition improved only slightly (GCS E3VeM4), although her seizure activity subsided after treatment. Brain MRI revealed extensive T2 and FLAIR-hyperintense lesions in the white matter of the bilateral cerebral hemisphere, corpus callosum, thalamus, and midbrain and the right middle cerebellar peduncle (Fig. 1A-E). Some of the lesions contained areas of restricted diffusion (Fig. 1F). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed increased intensity of the lactate peaks in the white matter lesions (Fig. 1G). Autoantibodies from the autoimmune encephalitis panel were negative. For detecting pathogens, the patient’s CSF was examined for bacterial culture, virus isolation and DNA of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), and tested with a FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel (bioMérieux, France) for detecting genomes of cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, human herpes virus 6, human parechovirus, E. coli K1, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitides, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii. Serological tests for Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue viruses were negative. bacterial culture, virus isolation, serological tests and PCR for genome for various infectious pathogens in CSF were all negative. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) was initially considered, and steroid therapy (methylprednisolone 1 g/day for five days, followed by oral prednisolone 1 g/kg body weight/day) was initiated on Day 5. Repeated brain MRI on Day 9 revealed similar findings. On Day 11, a blood test revealed an increase in the interleukin-6 (IL-6) level (46.7 pg/ml, normal < 7) despite the concurrent use of steroids. On the basis of these findings, combined with the prodromal viral infection, the brain MRI findings and the exclusion of infectious encephalitis, ANE related to influenza A was diagnosed. A dose of tocilizumab 400 mg (2 mg/kg body weight) was thus administered intravenously, and oral prednisolone treatment was continued. She soon became more awake and was able to open her eyes spontaneously two days later. The endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation were removed on Day 17. Urinary tract infection by Klebsiella aerogenes developed on Day 18, which resolved with a course of treatment with cefperazone/sulbactam. However, the residual neurological deficits were severe. She presented with akinetic mutism (GCS E4V1M4) with general spasticity, rigidity and hyperreflexia and was wheelchair-ridden when discharged one month later. She needed one-person assistance to stand, had a modified Rankin scale score of 4, and had the same neurological examination findings three months after discharge.Fig. 1A-E Brain MRI demonstrated diffuse and generally symmetric T2 and FLAIR-hyperintense lesions in the white matter of the bilateral cerebral hemisphere, corpus callosum, thalamus and midbrain (A, B, D, E, FLAIR; C, T2 weighted image). Small areas of restricted diffusion were present (F, diffuse weighted image). 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed increased intensity of lactate peaks in the cerebral white matter lesion (G, arrow)Full size imageInfection with the influenza A(H3N2)pdm09 strain was subsequently confirmed by RT‒PCR. To investigate genetic predisposition for ANE, sequence-based genotyping for HLA and CPT2 were performed. It revealed that the patient carried heterozygous HLA-DQB1 03:03 and HLA-DRB1 09:01 alleles and was homozygous for p.lIe368 and p.Met647 in CPT2, all of these four variants having been associated with increased risk for ANE [12, 13].DiscussionReview of the literature on adult cases of influenza-associated ANEWe searched in PubMed and Google Scholar with the terms “acute necrotizing encephalopathy”, “influenza” and “adult” without limitation of language from 1995 (the year ANE first described). After eliminating duplicate cases and including the present case, we identified a total of 22 adult (≥ 18 years of age) patients (11 males, 11 females) with influenza-associated ANE, with one patient who experienced an ANE episode during childhood (Table 1) [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33]. The ages ranged from 22 to 71 (median 47) years. The influenza type was known in 20 patients, including influenza A in 15 patients and influenza B in 5 patients. Among the 9 patients who received influenza A virus typing, the H1N1 strain was identified in 7, and the H3N2 strain was identified in the other 2. Table 1 Clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome of adult influenza-associated ANE casesFull size tableThe median interval between the onset of ANE and that of prodromal influenza was 3 days (ranging from 0 to 9 days, data available in 18 patients). The leading clinical manifestations were conscious impairment (68%), altered mentality or behaviors (50%) and convulsive seizures (36%). The most common neuroimaging abnormality was acute inflammation of the thalamus (91%), which was usually bilaterally affected, followed by the cerebral hemisphere (59%), brainstem (50%), cerebellum (36%), basal ganglion (18%) and corpus callosum (14%). Regarding CSF studies (performed in 17 patients), an increase in protein levels (> 45 mg/dl) was the most common abnormality (14 patients, 82%), while leukocyte pleocytosis (> 5/mm3) was found in only five (29%) patients. For immunotherapy, 9 patients received combined corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment, 9 received corticosteroids alone, and 1 received IVIg only. Our patient is the only one who received tocilizumab treatment. Seven patients died during acute stage of the disease, with a mortality rate 32%. The survival rate was 74% for patients receiving corticosteroids, IVIg or both and 33% for those not receiving immunotherapy, suggesting a statistically nonsignificant trend toward increased survival associated with any immunotherapy (odds ratio 5.6, 95% CI 0.41–76; p = 0.163). It is noteworthy, however, that the sample size was small, and the timing, type and duration of immunotherapy were highly variable among these patients. Compared with pediatric cases of ANE related to influenza or other pathogens, there were no obvious differences in the intervals between the onset of influenza and ANE, clinical presentations, brain images, CSF profiles or mortality rate for these adult cases of influenza-associated ANE.Clinical manifestations of ANEDespite the diversity of infection pathogens, the clinical, radiological and laboratory presentations of parainfectious ANE are relatively stereotypic. Clinically, three stages in the clinical course could be identified in most ANE patients [34]. During the prodromal stage, the patients presented systemic manifestations of acute viral infections, most frequently respiratory tract manifestations, as well as generalized symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgia and malaise, but still had normal consciousness. Brain imaging findings were usually normal at this stage. The acute encephalopathy stage followed suddenly a few days after prodromal onset. It was characterized by rapidly progressive neurological dysfunction with mental and conscious deterioration, which was often combined with seizures and focal neurological deficits. The typical brain imaging findings during this stage were multifocal and generally symmetric inflammatory lesions of the cerebral cortex, white matter, deep gray matter, cerebellum and brainstem, with bilateral thalamic involvement being the most common and distinctive presentation [35, 36]. Occasionally, petechial hemorrhage occurred in the lesions. Acute extraneural organ injury, such as hepatic, hematological and pulmonary dysfunction, occurred in some patients [37]. The mortality rate could reach 25–40% [8, 38, 39]. While some patients with catastrophic encephalopathy who survived recovered gradually in the following several weeks, most of them had persistent and significant neurological sequelae.Diagnosis of ANEThe diagnostic criteria for ANE was proposed by Muzuguchi in 1997 [40]. Focusing on a neurological complication following viral infection and with exclusion of several clinical mimics in mind, this criteria encompasses the characteristic clinical presentation (rapid conscious alternation, convulsion), brain imaging features (symmetric multifocal lesions with bilateral thalamic lesions), CSF study findings (increase of protein level without leukocyte pleocytosis) and systemic involvement (increase of serum aminotransferase levels with elevation of ammonia). It is still widely applied to date in diagnosis of spontaneous or infection-provoked ANE.The differential diagnosis for ANE includes practically all of the post-infectious central nervous system complications, with ADEM, Reye syndrome and infectious encephalitis as the leading conditions to consider. ADEM and ANE shared a lot of clinical similarities, such as rapid development of conscious disturbance, altered mentality, seizure and multiple brain lesions. While ANE occurs during the early febrile period of viral infection, ADEM typically develops up to several (mean 12.5) days after the initial symptoms and signs of infection subsides [41]. Different from normal cell counts in CSF in most cases of ANE [42], ADEM patients usually show neutrophil pleocytosis in CSF analysis. Regarding neuroimaging findings, the multiple brain lesions are generally symmetric in distribution in ANE and the bilateral thalamic involvement is highly specific. In contrast, the bilateral brain lesions are asymmetric and the bilateral thalamic lesion is present only in 30—50% of ADEM patients [43]. Reye syndrome also has similar clinical manifestations with ANE. However, the most common laboratory finding for Reye syndrome is hyperammonemia occurring 1 to 2 days after onset, sometimes combined with hypoglycemia and coagulation dysfunction. These findings however are absent in ANE patients [40]. Besides, imaging and pathology studies in Reye syndrome shows only diffuse brain edema, in contrast that multifocal lesions in neuroimaging are essential for diagnosing ANE. Finally, ANE can be differentiated from infectious meningoencephalitis through specific antibody testing, microbial culture or isolation, or direct detection of the pathogen genome in CSF.Pathogenesis of ANEAlthough the pathogenesis of ANE remains unclear, the uncontrolled production of proinflammatory cytokines by the innate immune system (“cytokine storm”) in response to viral infection is the most commonly proposed mechanism [8, 44]. The cytokines involved in ANE may include various interleukins, interferons and chemokines, with IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α being the most prominent [8, 44]. In in vivo and in vitro studies, the administration of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α to cerebral vessels led to vasodilation, endothelial tight junction perturbation and subsequent blood‒brain barrier (BBB) breakdown [45,46,47]. In line with this, brain biopsy and postmortem pathologic examinations in ANE patients have shown minimal lymphocytic or neutrophilic infiltrations or demyelination, despite marked brain parenchyma abnormalities such as hemorrhagic or coagulation necrosis and edema and axonal damage [23, 24, 48,49,50], and CSF pleocytosis is usually absent [42]. In addition to disrupting BBB integrity, excessive cytokines also cause excitotoxic neuronal damage, immune cell overactivation and secondary organ damage. Microglial priming, a condition in which microglia multiply and become activated, may also underlie ANE. Priming increases the sensitivity of microglia to a secondary inflammatory stimulus (e.g., peripheral cytokine release), which can induce an exaggerated immunological response. This mechanism has been shown to contribute to the neurological complications associated with nonneurotropic influenza strains, such as H1N1 [51] and H3N2 [52]. Clinically, a higher serum level of IL-6 is correlated with the development of brainstem dysfunction, which has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in ANE patients [53, 54].Host genetic factors of ANEGenetic background may contribute to the predilection of ANE in East Asian populations. The HLA DQB1 03:03 and DRB1 09:01 genotypes and the thermolabile CPT2 variants, which have the highest frequencies in the eastern ethnicities, have been associated with ANE [12, 13]. Our patient carried two HLA alleles and two homozygous CPT2 risk variants for ANE. HLA genes govern antigen presentation and are crucial components of the human immune system. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase II, the protein encoded by CPT2, is one of the mitochondrial enzymes essential for long-chain fatty acid oxidation. Mitochondrial dysfunction and energy deficiency may underlie BBB disruption and cerebral edema in ANE [55]. On the other hand, the relationship between ANE1 (the ANE caused by RANBP2 mutations) penetrance and environmental triggers [9] and a case report of a Caucasian infant who resided in East Asia for the first several months of life and developed HHV-6-associated ANE three months after returning to a western country [56] imply the role of environmental factors in the predisposition to ANE occurrence. More studies are needed to elucidate the complexity of interactions between infectious pathogens and genetic or environmental factors in ANE development.Treatment of ANEAlthough there has been no definitive guideline for management of ANE to date, most recommended treatments involve immunotherapeutic regimens which are given early and in combinations. A retrospective case-series study showed that administration of corticosteroids, either methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, within 24 h after onset was associated with better prognosis [57]. The common immunomodulatory treatments combined with steroid include IVIg and plasmapheresis. Furthermore, regarding the potentially pivotal role of cytokines in ANE development, anticytokine therapy is considered a rational treatment for ANE. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody blocking the IL-6 receptor, has been shown to significantly lower IL-6 levels and has become an emerging therapy for ANE. Case reports and a small uncontrolled study findings have suggested that tocilizumab may have synergistic effects with corticosteroid and may be effective for severe ANE when administered early in the disease course [58,59,60,61]. However, whether tocilizumab reduces mortality or possibility of severe neurological sequelae is still unclear.ConclusionsIn the face of the growing prevalence of re-emerging and emerging infectious diseases in recent years, the occurrence of neurological complications related to viral infections, including ANE, is expected to increase. For instance, with the pandemic of COVID-19, ANE related to SARS-CoV-2 has been increasingly recognized in recent years. SARS-CoV2-associated ANE is similar to influenza-associated ANE in presenting symptoms, onset time related to prodromal infection, typical locations of brain lesions, CSF and serum cytokine profiles, and disease outcome [62]. Remarkably, adult patients may account for a higher proportion in SARS-CoV2-associated ANE, up to 80% in a case series [62]. Our report highlights the importance of identifying this devastating but treatable neurological complication of viral infections in adults, especially in East Asian populations. In addition, cytokine-inhibiting monoclonal antibodies may be promising treatments for ANE, for which further investigation is warranted.

Survey data are used to estimate the percentage of adults vaccinated against flu and to describe knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about the flu vaccine and vaccines in general. This year, we have expanded our scope by introducing a new section focusing on the recently approved Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccine. This addition aims to assess public awareness about the disease and intent regarding the RSV vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccination section was retained to continue tracking COVID-19 vaccine uptake and attitudes toward flu and COVID-19 vaccines co-administration. Data collection took place between January 3 and March 5, 2024. On this page Highlights Purpose of this survey Background Key results Influenza vaccine COVID-19 vaccines RSV vaccine Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about vaccination To summarize Contact us Related links Highlights Influenza vaccination coverage in 2023-2024 (42%) was similar to the previous season (43%). While vaccination coverage among seniors (73%) is closer to the coverage goal of 80%, only 44% of the adults aged 18-64 years with chronic medical conditions received the flu shot in Canada. The most common reason for getting the flu shot was to prevent infection (23%), whereas the most common reason for not getting the flu shot was the perception that the vaccine was not needed (31%). Most adults vaccinated for flu (71%) had received a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as the flu shot. In total, 89% of adults had received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine since the beginning of vaccination, while more than one-third (39%) received 1 dose during the 2023-2024 Fall campaign. The most common reason for not receiving a COVID-19 vaccine in the 2023-2024 Fall campaign was concerns about the safety or side effects of having so many COVID-19 vaccines (19%). Less than a third of adults (30%) would definitely receive a RSV vaccine when it becomes available. Despite most people agreeing that the flu shot is safe (87%), 43% of adults mistakenly believed that they could get the flu from the flu vaccine. Purpose of this survey The survey results provide necessary information about how well adults are protected against flu and COVID-19 in Canada, as well as what they know and think about these vaccines. Besides measuring the vaccination coverage, the survey results are used to: measure progress towards achieving Canada's national vaccination coverage goals determine vaccination barriers and guide promotion efforts identify potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on seasonal influenza vaccine uptake measure attitudes toward flu and COVID-19 vaccines co-administration assess awareness and vaccination intent regarding the newly approved RSV vaccine report Canada's vaccination coverage to the World Health Organization (WHO) Background In Canada, the flu season normally runs from November to April. Anyone can get the flu, which can sometimes lead to severe complications or death. Among those eligible for flu vaccination, some people are at higher risk for complications or hospitalization due to the flu, including: all children 6 to 59 months of age people with certain chronic medical conditions pregnant people people 65 years and older people who live in nursing homes or other long-term care facilities Indigenous peoples The influenza vaccine, also known as the flu shot, is the best way to prevent the disease. Every Canadian 6 months of age and older is recommended to get the flu shot every year. Getting the flu shot early before the flu season helps protect from infection before the virus begins to spread widely. Key results Influenza vaccine Flu vaccination coverage Figure 1. Seasonal flu vaccination coverage, 2020-2021 to 2023-2024 flu seasons Figure 1: Text description Seasonal flu vaccination coverage (percent vaccinated) Flu season All adults (18 years and older) People aged 18-64 without chronic medical conditions People aged 18-64 with chronic medical conditions Seniors (65 years and older) 2020-2021 40 29 41 70 2021-2022 39 27 38 71 2022-2023 43 31 43 74 2023-2024 42 28 44 73 In all adults, influenza vaccination coverage in 2023-2024 (42%) was similar to the previous season (43%). Canada's goal is to have 80% of those at higher risk of complications from the flu vaccinated. This includes seniors (65 years of age and older) and adults aged 18-64 years with chronic medical conditions. In the 2023-2024 flu season: Only 44% of the adults aged 18-64 years with chronic medical conditions received the flu shot in Canada. This proportion is similar to the previous seasons (43%). Vaccination coverage among seniors (73%) is closer to the vaccination goal of 80%. Timing and place of vaccination Most vaccinated adults had received their shot in October (40%) and November 2023 (37%). The majority of adults were vaccinated at pharmacies (57%), followed by doctor's offices (15%) and temporary or permanent vaccine clinics (12%). The proportion of adults vaccinated in pharmacies increased from 35% in 2018-2019 to 57% in 2023-2024; this increase could be attributed to a growing number of jurisdictions allowing pharmacists to administer the influenza vaccine. Reasons to get, or not get the flu shot The most common reason for getting the flu shot was to prevent infection or avoid getting sick (23%). The most common reason for not getting the flu shot was the perception that the vaccine was not needed (31%). Barriers to get the flu shot In total, only 15% of the adults stated that they had encountered difficulties in scheduling an appointment for getting the flu shot this year. The proportion was much lower compared to the 2020-2021 season during the COVID-19 pandemic (47%). The most common difficulty encountered was limited appointment availability (e.g. no vaccine available, hard to book an appointment) (4%). Flu and COVID-19 vaccines co-administration This season, 71% of adults vaccinated for flu received a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time. The most common reason for receiving both vaccines at the same time was to save time (47%). The most important reason for not receiving both vaccines at the same time was being unable to book an appointment to receive them at the same visit (43%), followed by concerns about causing a higher number of adverse reactions or side effects (15%). Intent of getting the flu shot next flu season 39% of adults stated that they definitely will get the flu shot next flu season. The proportion was higher among seniors (40%) and younger adults with chronic medical conditions (36%), compared to those without chronic medical conditions (23%). COVID-19 vaccines COVID-19 vaccination coverage Most adults in Canada (89%) had received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine since the beginning of COVID-19 vaccination. 39% of adults received a COVID-19 vaccine during the 2023-2024 Fall campaign. Seniors had higher proportion (67%) of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine during the 2023-2024 Fall campaign, compared to younger adults with (39%) or without chronic medical conditions (26%). Reasons to get, or not get a COVID-19 vaccine The most common reason for getting a COVID-19 vaccine during the 2023-2024 Fall campaign was to protect oneself from COVID-19 (41%). The most common reason for not getting a COVID-19 vaccine during the 2023-2024 Fall campaign was the concerns about the safety or side effects of having so many COVID-19 vaccines (19%). RSV vaccine Awareness of RSV 40% of adults have not heard about Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Only 28% of adults know about RSV and what symptoms it causes, while 33% heard about it but do not know what exact symptoms it causes. RSV vaccine intent Overall, about a third of adults (30%) would definitely receive a RSV vaccine when it becomes available. Among those who heard about RSV and know what symptoms it causes, 43% would definitely receive the vaccine when it becomes available. The proportion of adults would definitely receive a RSV vaccine was higher among seniors (49%) and younger adults with chronic medical conditions (36%), compared to those without chronic medical conditions (20%). The most commonly stated reason for not getting a RSV vaccine when it becomes available was the belief in immune system capacity (28%), followed by the concerns about the safety of the RSV vaccine and/or its side effects (15%). Flu, COVID-19 and RSV vaccines co-administration intent If offered option, only 24% of adults would definitely receive the flu, COVID-19 and RSV vaccines during the same visit. The most common reason for not willing to receive 3 vaccines at the same time was concerns about causing a higher number of adverse reactions or side effects (35%). Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about vaccination Most adults (90%) reported that they considered vaccines to be important for their health and 91% knew why the flu vaccine is recommended annually. In addition, the majority of the adults (71%) agreed that the opinion of their family doctor, general practitioner, nurse practitioner or pharmacist is an important part of their decision in getting the flu shot. While most people believed that the flu shot is safe (87%), there was still a high proportion of adults (43%) who mistakenly believed that they might get the flu from the flu vaccine, which is not true for any flu shot. Moreover, a third of adults (34%) felt that the flu vaccine is ineffective in protecting them against getting the flu. And 40% believed that it is better to get natural immunity (protection) from getting sick with the flu rather than getting vaccinated. Despite the majority of the adults (70%) agreeing that it is safe to get the flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time; there were still 23% who thought that the flu vaccine or a COVID-19 vaccine could be less effective if getting them together. To summarize Overall, for the 2023-2024 flu season, flu vaccination coverage among all adults aged 18 years and older (42%) was similar to the previous season. The national flu vaccination coverage goal of 80% for those at higher risk remains unmet. Despite a higher flu vaccination coverage among seniors (73%), no significant improvement has been achieved in recent years. The most frequent reason for getting the flu shot was to prevent infection, whereas the most common reason for not getting the flu shot was the perception that the vaccine was not needed. An increased number of adults received their flu shot in a pharmacy compared to the pre-pandemic season, highlighting the importance of accessibility and convenience in vaccine uptake. The co-administration of flu and COVID-19 vaccines was common, with 71% of adults receiving both at the same time, mainly to save time. However, concerns about the safety and side effects of receiving multiple vaccines remain a barrier for some. Awareness and intent to receive the newly approved RSV vaccine were lower compared to flu and COVID-19 vaccines, indicating a need for increased public education and promotion efforts. Most adults value vaccines and recognize their importance, yet misconceptions about vaccine safety and effectiveness persist. Ongoing efforts to promote vaccine safety and dispel myths are essential to improve vaccination coverage and protect public health.

It said the findings have been confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory. Brian Henderson/Flickr cc In a statement, the CDFA said the three additional dairies are part of a group targeted for testing due to elevated risks from recent connections to the initially affected facilities. It added that the results are not surprising and support its surveillance strategy. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has added California's three new outbreaks to its list of confirmed H5N1 events, which puts the national total at 201 outbreaks across 14 states. CDC: Rotavirus vaccine 78% effective against serious illness in preschoolers, 53% in older kids News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Rotavirus Childhood Vaccines CDC / Dr. Erskine Palmer The effectiveness of a single dose of the rotavirus vaccine against emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations for inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract was 78% in children younger than 5 years and 53% in older children from 2009 to 2022, estimates a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-led study published yesterday in Pediatrics.The researchers used data from eight pediatric hospitals participating in the New Vaccine Surveillance Network to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against rotavirus among children seeking care in an ED or hospital for gastroenteritis defined by at least three diarrhea episodes or one vomiting episode in 1 day.The test-negative case-control study included 1,720 children younger than 5 years and 14,468 uninfected pediatric control patients. A total of 2,729 participants aged 5 to 17 years were included only in the age-stratified VE analysis."Rotavirus was the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis among US children until vaccine introduction in 2006, after which, substantial declines in severe rotavirus disease occurred," the study authors noted. "To maintain the public's confidence in the rotavirus vaccination program, it is critical to monitor long-term effectiveness of rotavirus vaccines, especially against severe illness."VE declined after 3 years of ageVE of one rotavirus vaccine dose against ED visits or hospitalizations due to common circulating genotypes was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75% to 80%) among children younger than 5. Stratification by a modified Vesikari Severity Score revealed VEs against mild, moderately severe, and very severe illness of 59% (95% CI, 49% to 67%), 80% (95% CI, 77% to 83%), and 94% (95% CI, 90% to 97%), respectively. Rotavirus vaccines remain highly effective in preventing rotavirus-associated ED visits and hospitalizations across time, disease severity, and common genotypes in the US.VE against rotavirus infection was highest in children younger than 3 years (73% to 88%) and declined with increasing age. Infected patients were less likely to be vaccinated against rotavirus than controls (62% vs 88%). "Rotavirus vaccines remain highly effective in preventing rotavirus-associated ED visits and hospitalizations across time, disease severity, and common genotypes in the US," the researchers wrote.

In many ways, the flu virus works the same way ― which explains how it manages to infect a billion people a year around the world.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyInfluenza is a contagious, infectious disease that continually circulates through the global population. The virus keeps moving because of … well, all of us.The process is simple: We get the flu virus. We share the flu virus. We repeat the process.But that doesn’t mean that we’re powerless to slow the respiratory illness. Knowing when you start being contagious with the flu and how long you’re contagious allows you to take precautions to not infect others.For more on flu germs, we turn to infectious disease doctor Sherif Mossad, MD.How contagious is the flu?“Highly” is the answer to that question. The flu can spread extremely quickly through a large group once the virus arrives on the scene. (Think of your office, for example, or your child’s school.)People with the flu can spread the ickiness to anyone within 6 feet of them, notes Dr. Mossad. The virus is typically delivered through droplets sent airborne when people cough, sneeze or simply talk.Sometimes, people can be infected with the flu and share the virus without showing any symptoms of the illness.When are you contagious with the flu?If you get the flu, it usually takes two days to start showing the classic symptoms such as a fever, chills, cough and headache. Sometimes, it can take up to four days for symptoms to appear.AdvertisementYou can start spreading the virus during that waiting period.“You may be contagious with the flu beginning about a day before you feel symptoms ― meaning you can spread it to others before you know you’re sick,” explains Dr. Mossad.You’ll be most contagious with the flu during the first three or four days after you feel ill. Germs may still be shared for a week after symptoms start, too. (Children and adults with weakened immune systems may be contagious even longer.)“That’s why keeping your distance from others for several days after you get sick is important,” he adds.How long should you isolate with the flu?A good rule of thumb is to stay home from work or school until you’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol®) or ibuprofen (Advil®), notes Dr. Mossad.A fever is defined as:Higher than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (or 38 degrees Celsius) in adults.Higher than 100.4 F (38 C) in children, if measured rectally.Higher than 99.5 F (37.5 C) in children, if measured orally.Higher than 99 F (37.2 C) in children, if measured under an arm.You should also stay home if you have other severe symptoms, such as a nonstop cough or shortness of breath. (This should be obvious, but if you’re showing signs of being sick, you probably still are.)The timeframe for returning to work or school activities may also depend on your job and how frequently you interact with people. Many organizations have specific guidelines for when you can go back. Check for any procedures.How does the flu spread?The flu spreads when tiny droplets of virus-laden particles are exchanged between people.“The main way people infect each other with flu is being in close proximity,” clarifies Dr. Mossad. “An infected person coughs or sneezes and tiny drops of fluids get on your face or hands ― and eventually, those virus-filled particles get in you.”And once you’re infected, you can start passing the flu to others within about 24 hours to continue the spread.How can you prevent the spread of the flu?To avoid the virus and stay healthy during flu season, Dr. Mossad suggests a multipronged approach for protection.Get your flu vaccineThe first and most important step in preventing flu is to get a flu vaccine each year.“The flu shot is your best defense against the flu,” Dr. Mossad stresses. “Studies tell us that if you get the flu vaccine, you are much less likely to have a severe illness and much less likely to be hospitalized.”Influenza annually causes 3 million to 5 million cases of severe illness around the world, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It also leads to 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths a year.AdvertisementWash your handsWhether you realize it or not, you probably touch your face an average of 23 times an hour. Now imagine all the potentially germy things you’ve touched since the last time you washed your hands. Ick, right?Washing your hands is the No. 1 way to keep viruses from elbowing their way into your body and making you sick. There’s a long list of instances when it’s appropriate to wash your hands, but these are particularly important during flu season:Before and after contact with an ill person.After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. (Wash your hands more often when you’re sick to prevent spreading your germs to those around you, too.)Every time you come home after being out.Before eating or preparing food.Wash your hands thoroughly for about 20 seconds with soap and water. If you aren’t able to use soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.Everyday preventive measuresLimit your opportunities for being infected by:Avoiding being around people who are sick whenever possible.Keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth.Eating well, exercising and getting enough rest.Considering a multivitamin and possibly vitamin D supplements to support your immune system. (Ask your healthcare provider if you think you would benefit from supplements.)AdvertisementAnd if you don’t feel well, stay away from other people to help them stay healthy.Getting flu treatmentEven if you take every possible precaution, you may still get the flu. (It is a rather persistent virus.) Call a healthcare provider as soon as possible when symptoms start.“There are medications your doctor can give you early to help lessen the effects of the flu,” says Dr. Mossad. “But if you wait, chances are you’ll be through the worst of your symptoms and the medication isn’t going to be as helpful at that point.”Then, make sure to stay home and get some rest while keeping your germs to yourself.AdvertisementLearn more about our editorial process.Health LibraryFlu (Influenza)OverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionHealth LibraryFlu (Influenza)OverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionAdvertisementRelated ArticlesOctober 29, 2024/Children's HealthRSV vs. Pneumonia: Sorting out Your Child’s Fever and CoughRSV can lead your child to develop pneumonia and have trouble breathingOctober 23, 2024/Cold, Flu & Respiratory IllnessesWhat Is Respiratory Season, and Are You Ready?Getting vaccinated in October can help protect you against severe illness between November and MarchOctober 8, 2024/Mental HealthHands Off!

The outbreak, which began on a laying poultry farm in the country's second-largest poultry production zone, spread rapidly, causing 100 percent mortality in three days across ten other farms within a week. The urgency to control the outbreak was heightened by a risk analysis indicating a high probability of disease spread due to inadequate biosecurity measures along the value chain.Intervention measures and the role of FAOUpon confirmation of the HPAI virus by the Central Veterinary Laboratory – which was fully renovated and equipped by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) in Guinea, with financial support from the United States Agency for International Development – comprehensive containment measures were implemented in support of veterinary services. The affected area was divided into three zones: the infected zone, the buffer zone and the surveillance zone.In the infected zone, covering a radius of 3 to 5 kilometres, the response included sanitary stamping out, burial and the incineration of carcasses, followed by thorough cleaning and disinfection of affected farms. The movement of poultry and its products was prohibited, and checkpoints were established to enforce these measures. Additionally, the sale of poultry and eggs was banned in shops and markets within a 10-kilometre radius. Public awareness campaigns and biosecurity training sessions for value chain actors were conducted in parallel.Despite these efforts, the disease continued to spread, infecting 21 additional farms within four weeks. An assessment revealed that containment measures were poorly adhered to by farmers, who, to avoid stamping out, were no longer reporting suspected cases and were clandestinely transporting eggs for sale in non-surveillance areas.The "farmer-to-farmer" approachTo address the issue of non-compliance, FAO introduced an innovative strategy: the "farmer-to-farmer" approach. This approach transformed farmers from their position of passive actors in the outbreak response to active actors.It involved building the capacity of 129 poultry farmers in terms of risk communication and control measures, including disinfection techniques following a training on disease transmission routes and risk factors. These poultry farmers were then empowered to conduct similar trainings (one-on-one education) from farm to farm within their communities. Each trained poultry farmer was responsible for educating an average of ten other poultry farmers per day. This community effort also involved farmers in the containment operations, including their constant presence at checkpoints, which were supported by security forces.This approach proved highly effective. Within a month, approximately 38 700 poultry farmers were reached. Two months later, the incidence rate of the disease had significantly decreased, and six months after the initial outbreak, the epidemic was declared eradicated. To date, no further cases have been reported in the same region.Sustainability and future prospectsThe success of the “farmer-to-farmer" approach highlights the importance of involving local communities in the fight against emerging diseases. In 2024, an HPAI outbreak declared in another region was contained to a single farm due to the swift mobilization of farmers implementing containment measures through their own initiative.This underscores that community-based response strategies can be crucial for the rapid and effective control of diseases. Involving the local community in managing outbreaks offers valuable opportunities for controlling emerging diseases in the future.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article H5N1 influenza surfaced in wastewater samples across all 10 Texas cities monitored by the TexWEB team at the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute in Houston. From March 4 through July 15, the group detected H5N1 in 10 of 10 cities, at 22 of 23 sites, and in 100 of 399 samples, Anthony Maresso, PhD, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and colleagues reported in a correspondence piece in the New England Journal of Medicine. They said the detections have not correlated with influenza-related hospitalizations, nor has the group picked up mutations that would signal adaptation to humans, notably the E627K mutation in the virus' polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) gene. Instead, the data suggest multiple animal sources, as all of their sequences "best match H5N1 genomes from birds and mammals" and are from the 2.3.4.4b clade, the investigators wrote. Nonetheless, Maresso's group called the "widespread detection" of H5N1 in wastewater from 10 cities "troubling." "My hope is that the next time we look, we stop seeing it," co-author Blake Hanson, PhD, of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, told MedPage Today. "We think of this as a sentinel proxy of what's circulating in our community. It doesn't mean it's human, we can't tell if it's a specific animal, but it does mean it's around us in our community, and that's something we should remain vigilant about." MedPage Today previously reported that the TexWEB team -- a collaboration between state government, Baylor, UTHealth, and municipal wastewater sources -- surveils influenza at a more granular level than the CDC's wastewater dashboard, which monitors for influenza A. It also dives deeper than other efforts that use PCR to look for the H5 hemagglutinin gene. The potentially more sensitive methods continue to pick up an H5N1 signal even as detections from other groups have fallen off since the spring, said co-author Michael Tisza, PhD, of Baylor College of Medicine. The decline could have something to do with "surveillance and quarantining and other preventive methods in the dairy industry," Tisza told MedPage Today, but it's not possible to say definitively. Tisza said it's notable that most of the 15 human cases reported this year have had H5N1 genomes that have been identical to those in cows, and that it's been surprising that they haven't detected more of the hallmark mutations that would indicate adaptation to humans. Earlier this year, the TexWEB team reported detecting H5N1 in wastewater from nine Texas cities from March 4 through April 25 in a medRxiv preprint. Another team from Verily Life Sciences, Emory University, and Stanford University reported earlier this year that it detected influenza A at 59 wastewater treatment plants in the U.S. this spring. Those researchers then searched for -- and found -- the H5 gene using PCR at three wastewater treatment plants with a positive flu A signal. That team has since identified the H5 gene at 25 sites across nine states, according to the correspondence. Heading into the fall, the TexWEB team will be working to "disentangle H5N1 from those other strains [that] might be circulating as seasonal flu starts to increase," Hanson said. Hanson and Tisza noted that they track many other viruses, and have seen the summer COVID surge in their surveillance, as well as the uptick in parvovirus B19 that was the subject of a CDC-issued HAN advisory earlier this summer. Their surveillance could also reveal whether cases of the more dangerous mpox clade I started to appear in the U.S., Tisza said: "We're really covering a lot of ground."

The patient was treated with influenza antiviral medications, was discharged from the hospital and has since recovered.This is the 14th instance in which a human was infected with the H5 virus in the United States in 2024. However, with every other case, the patient either had contact with a poultry flock or dairy cattle herd where the presence of the H5N1 virus was confirmed.Other states to have had confirmed human cases of avian influenza include Colorado, Texas and Michigan.CDC said it continues to closely monitor available data from influenza surveillance systems, particularly in affected states. It also assured the public that based on available date, the agency’s current assessment is that the risk to the general public from H5N1 virus remains low.

H5N1 avian flu virus detected in wastewater from 10 Texas cities News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) antikainen / iStock A report yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine details detection of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu virus in wastewater from 10 Texas cities during the same time period the virus was detected in Texas cattle herds.The study was conducted by researchers primarily from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth Houston) and Baylor College of Medicine. Before March 2024, H5N1 had not been detected in 1,337 wastewater samples analyzed by the team, a press release from UTHealth Houston said. From March 4 to July 15 of this year, H5N1 was detected as part of the virome (collection of viruses present in wastewater sample) in 10 of 10 cities, 22 of 23 sites (96%), and 100 of 399 samples (25%). "The abundance of H5N1 sequences identified has not correlated with influenza-related hospitalizations, which declined in Texas during the spring of 2024," the authors wrote. Overall risk still low Texas was the first state this year to confirm an H5N1 case, which involved an agricultural worker on March 28. The case-patient, who presented with conjunctivitis, among other mild symptoms, was exposed to symptomatic cattle. Since that detection, 13 other human US cases have been recorded, and all patients have made recoveries. "The widespread detection of influenza A(H5N1) virus in wastewater from 10 U.S. cities is troubling," the authors concluded. "Although the exact origin of the signal is currently unknown, the lack of clinical burden along with genomic information suggests multiple animal sources."The lack of clinical burden along with genomic information suggests multiple animal sources.Despite the findings, the risk to human health without direct contact with infected cattle like remains low, the authors said. IDSA, ESCMID call for 'robust action' on antimicrobial resistance ahead of UN meeting News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship TopMicrobialStock / iStock The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) are calling for world leaders to take "robust action" to mitigate the impact of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).In a joint white paper published yesterday in CMI Communications, IDSA and ESCMID experts urged world leaders attending the upcoming United Nations (UN) High-Level Meeting on AMR to adopt a political declaration with "bold targets and practical steps" to accelerate progress against drug-resistant bacteria across the human, animal, agricultural, and environmental sectors. "To truly propel consequential, sustainable progress against AMR, the UN political declaration must include bold targets and be accompanied by robust financing," the groups wrote. "We urge all participants to agree on a global commitment to scale up action commensurate with the present threat of AMR, with the aim to reduce the global deaths caused by AMR by 10 percent by 2030."Targets on antibiotic use, infection controlAmong the targets recommended by IDSA/ESCMID to achieve that goal is for 70% of all antibiotic use globally to be from the group of antibiotics that the World Health Organization (WHO) defines as Access antibiotics—first- and second-line antibiotics with a narrow spectrum of activity that offer high therapeutic value with lower potential for resistance. They also call for a 30% reduction in the quantity of antibiotics used in the agri-food system.To prevent the infections that drive global use of antibiotics, the groups say world leaders should set a goal of reaching 14 million children globally with essential immunization services, commit to scaling up implementation of the WHO's infection prevention and control guidelines to ensure that all nations have the core components in place, and improve access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene.We urge all participants to agree on a global commitment to scale up action commensurate with the present threat of AMR, with the aim to reduce the global deaths caused by AMR by 10 percent by 2030.Other recommendations include rebuilding the antimicrobial drug pipeline, with a focus on developing a sustainable innovation ecosystem that can deliver drugs that target multidrug-resistant bacteria, strengthening and scaling up global AMR surveillance systems, and establishing an independent scientific panel for AMR mitigation."We strongly encourage them to work with our societies to help provide the scientific basis to guide this important work," they wrote. Novel antifungal candidate gets financial boost News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Fungal Infection UK-based biopharmaceutical company F2G today announced a $100 million financing round to advance late-stage development and commercialization of olorofim, a novel oral antifungal therapy for invasive aspergillosis and other invasive fungal infections.Olorofim is the leading candidate from the orotomide class of antifungals, which work through a different mechanism of action than existing antifungal medications. It's currently being investigated in a phase 2b study in patients who have limited treatment options for rare and difficult-to-treat invasive fungal mold infections such as azole-resistant aspergillosis. Olorofim has received orphan drug status from the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product designation by the FDA."This is a pivotal period for the company as we conclude the final stages of development and preparation for commercialization of olorofim in the US and elsewhere," F2G CEO Francesco Maria Lavino, MBA, said in a company press release. "If approved, olorofim is expected to be the first of a new class of antifungal agents with a novel, differentiated mechanism of action and will address genuine unmet needs in conditions with high morbidity and mortality."An 'urgently needed' therapyThe financing round is being led by the AMR Action Fund, which was launched in 2020 with the aim of investing $1 billion to bring new antibiotics and antifungals to the market. AMR Action Fund CEO Henry Skinner, PhD, will join the F2G board of directors."For decades, clinicians have relied on a handful of antifungal classes, with few mechanisms of action and significant limitations due to spectrum of activity, drug toxicities, or drug-drug interactions," Skinner said. "These therapies are increasingly failing in patients. We are thrilled to support F2G’s team as they develop this urgently needed therapy and seek regulatory approval."

It has been said that the U.S. doesn’t have a healthcare system; rather we have a disease management system—we wait until diseases occur and then spend trillions of dollars trying to manage them. Immunizations are an example of successful, inexpensive disease prevention. They stimulate the immune system to fight off infectious diseases, without the vaccinated person experiencing the disease. They have saved millions of lives worldwide and prevented millions of cases of disability–such as deafness from measles, birth defects from rubella, paralysis from polio, and long-COVID. Thousands of Americans die every year from influenza and its complications—and most of these deaths would be prevented if everyone had an annual flu shot. Of lesser concern–but still important–is that influenza accounts for many days of lost work and school absences. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends a flu shot by the end of October for everyone over the age of 6 months, with rare exceptions (egg allergy is no longer one of them). Children under the age of 6 months should not receive flu shots, so it’s particularly important that care givers for these children are immunized. Adults 65 and older need extra strength vaccine. Protection from flu shots wanes throughout the season, so the optimal time to get vaccinated is early October. Influenza is caused by viruses—which do not respond to antibiotics. The most severe forms of flu are influenza A and B, with C being milder. In temperate climates such as ours, flu viruses are usually active during the colder months—late fall, winter and early spring. It takes about 2 weeks for the shots to take effect. Flu shots can be obtained in most doctors’ offices, in pharmacies, and at public health offices. They are tweaked every year, due to “genetic drift” in influenza viruses. Go to the CDC website to learn about the several flu vaccine options available this year, or discuss with your PCP or whoever is giving you the vaccine. Side effects from flu shots are rare, other than mild soreness around the injection site for a day or two. People sometimes claim that the flu shot gave them the flu, but that has never been proven to occur. The average adult gets five, non-influenza viral infections a year such as colds, so out of the millions of flu shots that are given every year some people will coincidentally come down with one of these other viral infections and blame it on the flu shot they just had. Influenza is highly contagious, and is transmitted by the respiratory route, meaning nasal drainage and droplets expelled by coughing. The incubation period is 1-4 days. Typical symptoms include fever, chills, malaise (feeling really crummy), generalized aching, chest discomfort, headache, nasal stuffiness, dry cough, and sore throat. Elderly patients often present with lassitude and confusion but not the other symptoms. Common flu complications include sinus and ear infections, bronchitis, and pneumonia (viral and bacterial), with pneumonia usually being the cause of flu-related deaths. Did you know that flu shots can reduce the incidence of heart attacks and strokes? Bacterial, and viral infections such as influenza, cause inflammation that can triggers rupture of arterial plaque—resulting in heart attacks and strokes. According to Bale and Doneen in their book “Beat the Heart Attack Gene,” a large study showed that up to 91,000 Americans die annually from heart attacks and strokes triggered by the flu—deaths that are not included in the statistics for flu-related deaths. Rapid flu tests done in doctors’ offices are helpful for diagnosis, although false negatives are common. Remember that flu shots only prevent influenza A and B–not colds or intestinal flu. They are not 100 percent effective in preventing influenza, but the disease tends to be shorter and milder in immunized people, and complications including death are much less apt to occur. Be proactive about your health, and get a flu shot this every year—and again, early October is ideal.

With the flu season imminent, new COVID-19 and influenza vaccines are available. What’s new with the vaccines and when should you get them? The CDC is recommending new COVID-19 and influenza vaccines for all and an RSV shot for adults 75 and older ahead of this year's flu season. [ CHRISTINA HOUSE | Los Angeles Times ]By Christopher O'DonnellTimes staffPublished Sept. 11|Updated Sept. 11Vaccinations have become a traditional part of flu season with the influenza vaccine revised most years to protect from new strains of the illness.But this year’s season could have some of us feeling like a pin cushion.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends adults 75 and older and those 60 and older at risk of respiratory diseases get a shot to protect against respiratory syncytial virus, a cold-like illness commonly known as RSV.On top of that, the federal agency recommends everyone six months and older receive both a flu shot and the new COVID-19 vaccine.The recommendations are not overkill, according to John Knisley, a CVS pharmacist and district leader for the pharmacy’s St. Petersburg market.“We’re seeing a lot of patients in our pharmacy that have respiratory illness symptoms,” he said. “There are definitely COVID-19 cases all over the place.”Here’s what you need to know about each vaccine:Is COVID-19 even a risk anymore?While the number of COVID-19 infections is far below the levels seen from the delta and omicron variants, the virus still carries a risk of severe symptoms, hospitalization and death. Infection spread is still occurring.More than 4,360 deaths from COVID-19 were recorded across the United States in August, according to CDC data. Florida recorded 786 deaths the same month, Department of Health Data shows.I already had the COVID-19 shots and a booster. Why do I need another one?The COVID-19 virus is constantly mutating into new variants. The new COVID-19 mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are designed to protect against the KP.2 variant. There is also a vaccine produced by Novavax based on the JN.1 variant, the parent strain of KP.2.All three vaccines are effective against COVID variants currently circulating and testing has shown they reduce the likelihood of infection resulting in severe illness or hospitalization. They also reduce the chances of developing long COVID, according to the CDC.This photomicrograph showed the presence of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, in a tissue sample. [ U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ]Is RSV dangerous?Respiratory syncytial virus causes infections of the lungs and respiratory tract. For most, symptoms are cold-like and mild but it can result in severe infection in infants, older adults and among those with heart and lung disease, or a weakened immune system, according to the Mayo Clinic.Who should get the RSV shot?The single shot RSV vaccine is recommended for all adults age 75 and up and for those age 60 to 74 with chronic heart or lung disease, a weakened immune system, are obese or diabetic and for those who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility.Those with severe allergic reactions to shots should consult their doctor. Details on the composition of the vaccine can be found in the manufacturer’s information sheets for GSK’s AREXVY, Pfizer’s ABRYSVO, and Moderna’s mRESVIA.Keep up with Tampa Bay’s top headlinesSubscribe to our free DayStarter newsletterWe’ll deliver the latest news and information you need to know every morning.Loading...You’re all signed up!Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox? Let’s get started.Explore all your optionsFor how long does the RSV shot provide protection?One dose of the vaccine protects against the virus for two winter seasons when most infections occur, the CDC states. Moderna’s mRESVIA provides protection for about 19 months.What’s new with the flu vaccine this year?All flu vaccines for the 2024-25 season will be trivalent, meaning they protect against three different strains of influenza: H1N1, H3N2 and a B/Victoria lineage virus, according to the CDC.When should I get vaccinated?COVID-19 shots should be obtained as soon as possible. The CDC recommends late summer for RSV and September and October for influenza shots before the diseases begin to spread more widely.“Some people wait until they see people catching the flu and that’s too late,” said Knisley.Can I get all the vaccines at the same time?The short answer is yes but you can also stagger them over a few weeks, Knisley said.Where can I get vaccinated?Vaccines are available through major pharmacies, through your doctor, or at federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics.CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Publix are among the companies offering all three shots at their stores. Walk-in appointments are available.Christopher O’Donnell is the health and medicine reporter. He can be reached at codonnell@tampabay.com.MORE FOR YOUFact-checking Robert F.

(Nasdaq:CVAC) ("CureVac"), a global biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of transformative medicines based on messenger ribonucleic acid ("mRNA"), today announced that GSK has reported positive Phase 2 headline data from the seasonal influenza mRNA vaccine program. The program was fully licensed to GSK under the terms of a licensing agreement announced on July 3, 2024.According to GSK, the data demonstrated positive immune responses against influenza A and B strains compared to the current standard of care, meeting all predefined success criteria in the tested age groups of older and younger adults. The interim data further suggests the tested vaccine candidate has an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile. The vaccine candidate is based on CureVac's second-generation mRNA backbone."The positive Phase 2 results once again highlight the immense potential of our second-generation mRNA backbone to develop best in class vaccines against influenza and other infectious diseases," said Dr. Myriam Mendila, Chief Scientific Officer of CureVac. "We are strongly encouraged by a positive response against influenza A strains but particularly excited about adequate immune responses against influenza B. We look forward to seeing advanced data from the study and potential transition of the program to Phase 3, which would be associated with a significant milestone payment for CureVac."The Phase 2 study was initiated following interim data reported on April 4, 2024, from the Phase 2 part of the ongoing combined Phase 1/2 study in seasonal influenza. It assesses the reactogenicity, safety, and immunogenicity of different dose levels of a modified, multivalent vaccine candidate, encoding antigens matched to all three WHO-recommended flu strains. The study includes 250 healthy younger adults aged 18 to 64 and 250 healthy older adults aged 65 to 85. In each age group, different dose levels will be tested in comparison to an age-appropriate, licensed comparator vaccine.About CureVacCureVac (Nasdaq:CVAC) is a pioneering multinational biotech company founded in 2000 to advance the field of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology for application in human medicine.

Getting Vaccinated. By Patti Zielinski Date September 11, 2024 Media Contact Patti Zielinski patti.zielinski@rutgers.edu Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Whatsapp Email Print An infectious disease expert at Rutgers Health explains the importance of getting crucial shots this fall Between Oct. 1, 2023 and June 15 of this year, about 35 million to 65 million people contracted the flu, with hundreds of thousands hospitalized and 25,000 to 72,000 deaths, including 197 children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC also estimates that in 2023 more than 916,300 people were hospitalized for COVID-19 and about 75,500 people died. Mid-September to late October is the optimal window for people to receive the updated flu and COVID-19 vaccinations to protect against severe illness this fall and winter, said David Cennimo, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. Cennimo discusses what you need to know about the series of recommended vaccines as well as what to anticipate this season for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). What can we learn from last year’s flu season – and what should we expect this year? The 2024-2025 influenza season is again predicted to peak sometime between late fall and early spring. The southern hemisphere influenza season is ending now and may provide some clues and predictions for the U.S. Most countries had similar levels to last season with severe disease also being seen. Unfortunately, a few countries did have much higher activity than expected. Most experts believe we will see similar levels of influenza infection as last year in the United States. Who should receive a vaccination for flu and COVID-19? The CDC recommends that people 6 months and older receive vaccinations for the flu and COVID-19. It is safe to receive both vaccines at the same visit. Multiple studies have demonstrated significantly reduced symptoms and a milder infection in vaccine recipients who become infected. David Cennimo Rutgers New Jersey Medical School What strains/variants will this year’s vaccines cover? The 2024-2025 U.S. flu vaccine is trivalent, meaning that it contains three different strains of influenza predicted to be most like what will be seen this year. Past years have been quadrivalent – four stains – however, the Yamagata lineage of Influenza B has not been seen in circulation since COVID-19 and has been removed. Slightly different virus strains are used for the egg-based vaccine versus cell culture-based vaccines. These changes address the ability of the virus to replicate and provide the best vaccine. At the individual patient level, they are interchangeable. The only advice I routinely give related to the specific type or brand of vaccine is for people 65 or older to attempt to get a “high dose” or adjuvanted flu shot. These stimulate more response in older immune systems. However, if they are not available, a standard influenza vaccine should be given. Multiple studies have demonstrated significantly reduced symptoms and a milder infection in vaccine recipients who become infected. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an updated version of the vaccine that targets the SARS CoV-2 currently circulating in the U.S. Much like the yearly adjustment of the influenza vaccine, the COVID-19 vaccine was adjusted to best reflect the subtype of virus currently causing most infections. How long should a person wait to be vaccinated after contracting COVID-19? The minimum recommended time between COVID-19 vaccine doses is eight weeks, according to the CDC. Those with recent infection may consider delaying vaccination for three months. There is a lower risk of reinfection in the three months following a COVID-19 infection, regardless of symptoms, so people can be considered relatively protected. Based on the revaccination data, I would wait at least eight weeks. Is RSV a concern this year? Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. The CDC recommends that infants 8 months and younger during RSV season receive an RSV immunization unless their mother was adequately vaccinated during the pregnancy. Older babies with certain medical conditions – in their second RSV season – may remain at high risk for complications from RSV infection and may require a second immunization. Adults ages 60 to 74 with increased risk of severe RSV infection and everyone 75 or older should consider be vaccinated with one of three available RSV vaccines. Pregnant people should consider being vaccinated with the Abrysvo vaccine between 32- and 36-weeks gestation. Currently, RSV vaccines are only recommended for a one-time dose. Why is mid-September to late October the best time to receive these vaccinations? The influenza vaccine is effective for about six months, so if you get vaccinated too early there is a chance your immunity might wane. Children receiving their first influenza vaccine need a second dose at least four weeks later. Check with your doctor. The RSV season varies but usually starts in fall and the rates of COVID-19 tend to increase in fall winter. Since RSV season starts in October, vulnerable people should receive the vaccine as soon as possible. Are these vaccines safe? Extremely rare side effects – like allergic reaction – can happen, but the risk is still lower than with many other common medications. You can get a flu shot even if you are allergic to eggs. Serious reactions to the small amount of egg protein in flu vaccines are unlikely. Can you get the flu, COVID or RSV from the vaccine? These vaccines take two weeks to be effective, so people still could contract these viruses during this period. COVID-19 vaccines contain no live virus so there is no way to become infected from the vaccine. With the flu vaccine, live viruses are grown but killed so there is no possibility of infection after vaccination, either. How can I tell if I have the flu, COVID-19 or RSV? Flu symptoms can be confused with COVID. If you start feeling ill, it is important to quarantine and test for COVID to rule it out. The symptoms for RSV are like the common cold. They tend to run their course with only mild intensity in adults and older children. In infants and the elderly, symptoms tend to be more severe and can include fevers and wheezing.

Investigators trying to determine how the person caught the virus have not been able to confirm the exact strain of flu. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said the risk to the general public remains low. The Missouri case raised questions about the possibility of human-to-human bird flu transmission, but officials said there is no evidence of other people being infected. READ MORE: Why is bird flu highly lethal to some animals, but not others? Scientists are trying to find out “Right now, evidence points to this being a one-off case,” said Dr. Nirav Shah, CDC principal deputy director. Unusual flu strains that come from animals are occasionally found in people. This year alone, health officials identified seven human cases of swine flu in the U.S., officials said. But this is the first time the surveillance system detected an avian flu like this. The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry, cows and a growing number of other animals. Its growing presence in the environment increases the chances that people will be exposed, and potentially catch it, Shah said. Citing patient confidentiality, health officials have disclosed few details about the Missouri case, which was first announced late last week. The person had chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and weakness and was hospitalized on Aug. 22 “for reasons related to their underlying medical conditions,” Shah said. The patient was tested for flu as part of the treatment and was positive for influenza A, a broad virus category. Subsequent testing — completed last week — found the bug to belong to category of viruses usually seen in birds and not people. However, the patient had a very low concentration of viral genetic material, leaving officials without the ability to full analyze it and confirm exactly which virus it is, Shah said. Partial genetic sequences from the virus in the Missouri patient were similar to the same segments in viruses isolated from U.S. dairy cows, CDC officials said. WATCH: Why scientists are concerned about the latest transmission of bird flu to cows “Ultimately, a full sequence may not be technically feasible,” Shah said. The patient had no known contact with dairy cows or other animals associated with the ongoing bird flu outbreak. The person later told Missouri health officials that they didn’t drink unpasteurized milk or dairy products, Shah said in a Thursday call with reporters. The patient received antiviral medication and has since recovered and gone home, health officials said. As part of their investigation, officials hope to draw blood from people who were around the patient to see if they show evidence of infection, Shah said. The Missouri patient was the 14th person in the U.S. sickened with bird flu since March, when the virus was detected in cows. One other person was infected in 2022. All of those cases were relatively mild illnesses, and each patient had been in direct contact with infected animals. U.S. health officials have been making preparations for vaccines and other measures, in case the bird flu does start spreading widely among people or begins causing severe illness. On Thursday, the CDC announced it is partnering with five commercial lab companies so they can develop and conduct tests for H5N1 or other viruses. The agency initially is devoting at least $5 million to the agreements, and making plans to scale up to $118 million over the next five years if necessary, Shah said. In the past, CDC developed its own tests during the early stages of new epidemics, with widespread testing not becoming available until later. That slowed detection of emerging infections.

Delaware Valley health experts say it’s time to get vaccinated New updated vaccines for flu and COVID-19, as well as protection against RSV for infants and seniors, will be available this fall. ByNicole LeonardSeptember 9, 2024 Listen 1:23 A nurse prepares a syringe of a COVID-19 vaccine at an inoculation station in Jackson, Miss., July 19, 2022. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, File) From Philly and the Pa. suburbs to South Jersey and Delaware, what would you like WHYY News to cover? Let us know! Summer is wrapping up and the fall and winter respiratory virus season is just around the corner. Health care providers are bracing for an uptick in influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and more COVID-19 patients over the next couple of months Experts are recommending people to get annual vaccines and protect themselves from severe illness and infection. And the time to get those shots is now. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor “It is so important to get these immunizations before you are exposed to the viruses,” said pediatrician Dr. Jonathan Miller, chief of primary care pediatrics at Nemours Children’s Health Delaware Valley. “It’s not the best idea to wait until after New Year’s — that’s too late. So many kids end up getting sick before the body gets immunity, so try to come in early.” Most common fall and winter viral diseases Many different types of viral infections pick up in the colder months as people spend more time socializing indoors, in close contact with one another. Influenza is one of the biggest drivers of seasonal illness. It can spread from person to person through respiratory droplets in the air after someone coughs, sneezes or talks. People can also get it from touching surfaces with the virus on it and then touching their own nose, mouth or eyes. Many people experience mild or moderate symptoms and eventually recover on their own with over-the-counter medications. But the flu still caused more than 400,000 hospitalizations and 25,000 deaths nationally this past year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, COVID-19 continues to circulate year-round. Many states and communities are coming off a summer surge and the virus continues to mutate into new variants. “A lot of people are getting COVID right now because their immunity either from having had COVID in the past or from having had COVID vaccine in the past is waning,” Miller said, “And the new strain of COVID is able to infect people.” Experts said they expect additional spikes in cases over the winter holidays as larger groups of people travel and get together. For infants and toddlers, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, poses a big threat. Senior adults and people with compromised immune systems are also at risk. The virus is a leading cause of hospitalizations in the colder months, Miller said. “So when our [children’s] hospital fills up in the winter, it’s largely due to RSV causing labored breathing and need for oxygen and other respiratory support,” Miller said. Related Content Health How to stay healthy during cold, flu and COVID-19 season Last week, 25 U.S. states had high or very high levels for respiratory illnesses with fever, cough and other symptoms. 10 months ago Vaccines available this season It’s likely that many people are due for annual COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, and experts recommend that people get them at the same time. It’s one less trip to the clinic or doctor’s office, and it can also be easier to make it into an annual routine. “People have work and other responsibilities and, unfortunately, health interventions sometimes take a back seat to the necessity of getting a kid off to a game or getting a project done at work,” said Dr. Herb Conaway, medical director of the Burlington County Health Department in New Jersey. “So, strike while the iron is hot, particularly in this case when it’s safe to do so.” New updated COVID-19 vaccines are on their way to communities. They are formulated to protect against the latest circulating coronavirus variants. Similarly, this year’s flu vaccines are also designed to match a predicted set of strains that will appear this season. This year’s flu shots are trivalent, meaning they protect against two strains of influenza type A and one strain of influenza type B. For the last 10 years, flu shots have been quadrivalent and have included protection against a second influenza type B strain called Yamagata. WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor But since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, when people isolated and practiced social distancing for a length of time, the influenza type B Yamagata viruses have not been detected at all, said Dr. Richard Lorraine, medical director of the Montgomery County Office of Public Health in Pennsylvania. “And [the CDC] said, appropriately, there’s no good reason to put this strain into the vaccine,” he said. “Because with each additional strain, it becomes more difficult to manufacture the vaccine. Also, arguably, why give someone an extra strain in the vaccine that they probably don’t need?” COVID-19 and flu vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 months and older. People who have recently had COVID-19 may want to consider delaying their vaccine by 3 months, according to CDC guidelines. And while RSV historically poses a serious danger to infants, seniors and people with compromised immune systems every year, there have been very few prevention tools available to health care providers — until recently. In 2023, a single dose monoclonal antibody treatment called Beyfortus became available for newborns and some older infants. Related Content Health Philadelphia-area health experts see shift in attitudes on vaccination in ‘post-COVID’ era Misinformation, distrust in medical providers, politics and experiences during the height of COVID are playing into people’s views of vaccination, experts say. 2 months ago Listen 7:44 After last year’s initial rollout that came with some delays, confusion and a limited supply of doses, Miller said health offices and pediatricians expect to have enough supply this season to give shots to babies who are born during the typical RSV season or who are younger than 8 months and are entering their first RSV season. The RSV antibody shot is also recommended for children 8 to 19 months old if they are at an increased risk for the virus due to other health conditions. The monoclonal treatment provides infants with temporary protection and fighting immunity against the virus. It does not teach the body to make its own antibodies like typical vaccines. “Right now, we have the ability to give them the antibody, get them through the RSV season when they’re at highest risk, and then they tend to grow up, right?” Miller said. “They survive and they grow up and then their risk for RSV goes down and we don’t need to use this anymore.” New RSV vaccines for adults also came to market last year. They are recommended for everyone 75 years and older. They should also be offered to other adults 60 and older who have an increased risk of illness due to other health conditions and chronic diseases. An RSV vaccine is also recommended during pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend the shot for pregnant women and people in their second trimester, between 32 to 36 weeks gestation, during the months of September through January. It’s important for people to remember that these vaccines won’t completely prevent all illnesses, Lorraine said. “Whatever prevention we get, that’s a bonus. But the main reason is to decrease the severity so we have fewer hospitalizations, we have fewer ICU admissions, we have fewer deaths,” he said. “And these vaccines work pretty well to do that.” In addition to vaccination, people can practice good hygiene and hand washing to try and limit the spread of disease in the first place. Make it part of the routine, Conaway said. “You brush your teeth in the morning, you get yourself cleaned up after a busy day and do these sorts of common-sense precautions with respect to these circulating viruses,” he said. Adult and pediatric seasonal vaccines are available at local county health departments, city health centers, pharmacies and health provider offices. Get daily updates from WHYY News!

Photo: Herbert WiggermanDuring summer, between spring and autumn wild bird migrations, cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza tend to drop, which has recently occurred in Europe. The reduced number of cases in European countries could also be linked to immunity in some wild bird species, depletion of some wild bird populations and changing composition of circulating highly-pathogenic avian influenza virus genotypes.However, as autumn migration approaches, France is ramping up its vaccine programme, purchasing another 67.75 million doses. In addition, a team of virologists with the UK’s Animal and Plant Health Agency and others have found the global spread of the H5N1 avian influenza virus has made its way to multiple bird species in Antarctica, some of which migrate to other parts of the world throughout the year.Protection during migration Companies that normally allow hens access to the outdoors, such as Kipster, keep them inside during migration periods. The company notes that “outdoor access and biosecurity are often at odds with each other,” but, “even during confinement for diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, stimulating, spacious indoor gardens provide a safe environment and ensure chickens’ well-being is not compromised by restrictions.”In addition, the company notes the use of protective clothing, sanitation practices, and other preventative measures to minimise exposure of the hens to avian influenza and mitigate the risk of transmission from the outside world.ALSO READ: Spotting avian influenza with infrared imagingThe company also reports that this spring in the US, when the risk was heightened due to several avian influenza outbreaks on poultry and dairy farms in Indiana and neighboring states, the Kipster visitor centre closed for a few months. It was open as of early September, but visitors are asked not to enter the farm property, including the visitor centre, if they have been in contact with birds 72 hours before visiting.Antarctica outbreaksUK-based scientists on the Antarctic highly pathogenic avian influenza research team note that avian influenza has spread globally in recent years, first in the Eurasia during 2020-2021 before transatlantic spread to North America and onward dissemination into South America.“This worldwide progression has been driven by migratory wild bird species with avian and mammalian mass die-offs reported as far south as Patagonia,” they explain. “By autumn 2023, it was evident that this spread would not stop at the Americas: field evidence suggested that an intercontinental jump to Antarctica was imminent.”They have detected H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in samples in Antarctica from brown skuas, southern fulmars, black-browed albatrosses, Kelp gulls, Antarctic tern, South Georgia shag, Southern elephant seals and Antarctic Fur Seals.

The trial will assess the safety and tolerability of the influenza vaccine administered using the needle-free technology developed by Australian biotech company, Vaxxas. Unlike traditional needle and syringe administration, which is injected into a muscle, Vaxxas’ High-Density Microarray Patch (HD-MAP) technology delivers the vaccine to the immune cells immediately below the skin surface. Previous Phase I trials of Vaxxas’ HD-MAP technology have shown promising results in administering vaccines including seasonal influenza, COVID-19, and measles and rubella. In early studies, the technology has also shown to be easy to use with the potential for vaccines to be stable at room temperature, potentially reducing the need for cold-chain refrigeration and facilitating distribution of vaccine patches by mail or courier for self-administration. In the event of a future pandemic, the technology could enable a faster and broader vaccination response. Vaxxas CEO David Hoey said: "Global pandemic threats require the world’s health organisations to have better and more accessible vaccine delivery options. “With potential benefits such as thermostability, ease of use, and patient acceptability, Vaxxas’ HD-MAP is designed to be rapidly and broadly deployed to accelerate vaccination uptake and rates.” This clinical study, enrolling 258 participants between the ages of 18 and 50 years, and involving multiple clinical trial sites, will be Vaxxas’ largest Phase I trial conducted-to-date with its HD-MAP technology. Trial participants are required to be in good health and available to visit Doherty Clinical Trials’ facility in East Melbourne for nine scheduled visits across a 13-month period, where they will undergo a thorough medical examination by doctors, including a physical examination, measuring vital signs and conducting blood tests. Participants will be reimbursed for their time and expenses over the course of the study. Doherty Clinical Trials CEO, Dr. Andrew Brockway said: “We are excited to be collaborating with an Australian biotech company developing a novel vaccination product that could play a significant role in the way we respond to future pandemics. “If you are interested in being a part of supporting advances in vaccination technology, we’d love to hear from you.” Doherty Clinical Trials’ Chief Medical Officer, Professor James McCarthy said: “This new way of delivering vaccines, such as influenza, is very exciting as it could reduce some of the limitations associated with vaccination via traditional methods.” All strains of avian influenza, or ‘bird flu’ as it’s more commonly known, represent a potentially serious threat to humans, with vaccination remaining the most effective safeguard. Most infections in humans are mild or have no symptoms, similar to seasonal influenza, but occasionally symptoms can be severe. Since early 2013, over 1,500 people have been infected by avian influenza A worldwide, according to WHO. Other clinical sites involved in the study include three University of Sunshine Coast Trial centres in Brisbane, Morayfield and the Sunshine Coast. As a not-for-profit registered charity and subsidiary of the University of Melbourne, Doherty Clinical Trials has been established by the Doherty Institute to accelerate the development of novel medicines and vaccines through bespoke early phase clinical trial solutions.

On Thursday, health officials said they hadn’t determined how the person acquired the virus.“Right now, evidence points to this being a one-off case,” said Nirav Shah, the CDC’s principal deputy director, during a news briefing.Yet the case is troubling, because it raises the possibility of an alternate source of transmission, either from a person or an unknown source. Health officials say there is no evidence of person-to-person spread at this time. The CDC says its surveillance system has not picked up any unusual flu activity in the country, and the risk to the general public remains low.“Our influenza surveillance system is designed to find needles in haystacks,” Shah said in the briefing. “In this case, we found such a needle, but we don’t know how it got there.”The Missouri case is the first to be detected through the country’s national flu surveillance system as opposed to targeted testing of animals. This year, the H5N1 flu virus has been responsible for wiping out poultry flocks across the country and infecting 200 dairy herds in 14 states—the latest in California. It is increasingly spilling over to other mammals, including foxes, mice, raccoons, and domestic cats. With more animals harboring the virus, there is greater potential for human infection.It’s not known whether that happened in the Missouri case, but it is one avenue health officials say they are investigating.“Regardless of the source, it’s concerning, because it suggests that there’s a lot of the virus out there,” says David Boyd, a virologist at UC Santa Cruz who studies influenza. “This indicates that there is widespread transmission among animal sources.”Most PopularCultureTaylor Swift Fans Are Leaving X for Bluesky After Trump’s ElectionBy Vittoria ElliottGearI Went Birding With the World’s First AI-Powered BinocularsBy Lola MéndezScienceThe Incredible Power of Quantum MemoryBy Lakshmi ChandrasekaranScienceInvasive Species Are Threatening the Quality of New York’s Tap WaterBy Lauren DalbanOn August 22, an adult patient was hospitalized in Missouri for reasons related to underlying medical conditions and happened to also test positive for influenza. The patient’s specimen was then sent to the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory, which determined that it didn’t match the currently circulating seasonal flu viruses.That triggered additional testing by the CDC, which last week confirmed it was a type of bird flu, or H5. The agency was conducting additional testing to determine the virus subtype—the “N” part of H5N1. On Thursday, health officials said the patient had a very low concentration of viral genetic material and, because of this, they have not been able to generate a full genome, including the N part of the virus. However, their data shows that the specimen is closely related to the H5 virus circulating in dairy cows.Having a full genome sequence of the virus can be helpful in making an epidemiological link to an animal source. Because viruses change and mutate when they are transmitted to new hosts, the genetic sequence of the virus can give clues about where it’s been. Scientists would also be able to use a full genome sequence to identify potential genetic mutations that could make human-to-human transmission more likely.The patient has since recovered and has been discharged. Hospital staff and state epidemiologists conducted contact tracing of potentially exposed individuals, and no additional cases have been identified.Missouri’s health department says there has been no increase in emergency room visits for flu and no increase in lab-confirmed human flu cases in the state. Bird flu outbreaks in cattle have not been reported in Missouri, but outbreaks have been reported in commercial and backyard poultry flocks this year. Wild birds in the state have also tested positive for bird flu.Health officials are considering several potential routes of exposure, including contact with wild or agricultural animals, consumption of milk or undercooked meat, household travel, and attendance at public gatherings. Shah says the CDC’s investigation is also looking into the use of bird feeders, recent yard work, gardening, and lawn mowing.Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist and influenza researcher at Columbia University, says that this case being identified underscores the importance of the country’s influenza surveillance. “But the fact that this case was found fortuitously and took several weeks to identify shows that our surveillance system still needs to be more agile and systematic,” he says.The US has limited capacity for bird flu testing, but that could soon get a boost. On Thursday, the CDC also announced that it is partnering with five commercial laboratories and has awarded them an initial $5 million to start developing their own bird flu tests.You Might Also Like …In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each dayElection reaction: The manosphere wonThe Big Story: California will keep moving the world forwardTrump's failed attempt to overthrow Venezuela's presidentEvent: Join us for The Big Interview on December 3 in San FranciscoEmily Mullin is a staff writer at WIRED, covering biotechnology.

The Trust Project What is this? AMES, Iowa — Highly pathogenic avian influenza has spread across dairy herds and is found within raw milk. A team of Iowa State University researchers have been studying why.This was a discovery that was started by the death of domestic cats on dairy farms. ADVERTISEMENT “One of the things that led us to influenza was the fact that on those farms, there were, domestic cats were dying, as well as some wild birds. And so, knowing that domestic cats and wild birds can die from influenza, it was decided to test the milk for influenza,” said Eric Burrough, veterinary pathologist at the Iowa State University Diagnostic Lab.It was the first time that this virus had been found in the mammary gland of cattle.The best way to visualize how viruses get into the mammary glands is to envision a virus as a key that has to fit in the right lock in order to make its way inside of a cell.“A virus is a parasite that has to get inside of a cylinder to continue its life cycle. In order to do so, it has to have that right lock and key combination,” explained Tom Bell, professor of veterinary pathology at Iowa State University. “So, what we did is we looked at mammary gland cells to see if it had receptors for flu viruses, in particular for bird flu viruses. And what we found was indeed, yes.” Todd Bell and Eric Burrough, researchers at Iowa State University.Ariana Schumacher /Agweek Bell said that human viruses were also able to get inside of the cattle mammary glands. This means that potentially both bird and human flu viruses could get inside of the same cell, which is something that Bell explained they want to avoid if at all possible.Finding the virus in the cattle mammary glands could explain why this virus is spreading throughout dairy herds.“It seems to like the mammary gland with respect to there’s large viral loads that are found there,” Bell said. “When they do some special studies to look for virus both within the cell and within the milk, we see high viral loads and just lots of virus in both of the cells with the mammary glands as well as the milk within the mammary glands.” ADVERTISEMENT The virus can be transmitted to humans that drink raw milk, but pasteurized milk is safe to drink.“While I understand that there are people who like to do that (drink raw milk), there’s not only a risk of consuming HPAI, but there are other pathogens that could be in raw milk,” Burrough said. “I would say at this point in time, knowing how many dairies are affected, the likelihood of being exposed is high enough that I would avoid doing that (drinking raw milk).”Not only can it be an issue when it comes to raw milk consumption, but it can also spread through the use of milking machines on infected dairy operations. “Knowing that it can spread from cow to cow using the milking equipment I think is a relatively new and novel finding, but not surprising based on some of the research that we’ve done, knowing how much virus is in the mammary glands, but just knowing that cows can pass it horizontally in that way in a unique finding,” Burrough said.Now, there are new areas of biosecurity that need to be looked into on dairy operations across the country.

Knowing that is occurring, there’s the possibility for that milk to land on horizontal surfaces to be exposed to the dairy workers.There are other studies currently happening looking at whether or not the viruses could be passed to the cattle’s offspring through the milk. ADVERTISEMENT “A lot of those questions are still unanswered, but there’s been some studies in mice that have shown that there is some transmission between mom and pups both within the milk and then potentially they’re looking at other routes of transmission in that close contact as well,” Bell said.Now, researchers are also taking a look at the future risks of this virus, specifically if other animals are also susceptible to this virus.“Can this get into the milk of goats, milk of sheep and the milk of other animals? So we are trying to look at other domestic animals on these farms that could potentially be housed with some of these dairy cattle to determine whether or not that is a potential risk,” Bell said.They are now trying to better understand how this virus might get into an animal’s system.“Specially, can they drink water with flu virus in it and get it that way? Can they breathe in the flu virus, like is typically the way that flu virus is transmitted through aerosol transmission? So, we are trying to look at some different animal species to determine whether or not the other animals are susceptible by that route,” Bell explained.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. & BRISBANE, Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vaxxas today announced that it has initiated a multi-center Phase I clinical trial of a vaccine against pre-pandemic avian influenza strain H7N9, using the company’s high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP). Conducted in collaboration with Australian clinical sites, the multi-center trial is being led by Vaxxas with oversight by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and is designed to expand foundational novel countermeasure capabilities in response to potential future pandemic threats to public health. Vaxxas’ HD-MAP platform delivers vaccines by applying a small patch briefly to the skin, avoiding many of the costs and complexities of needle and syringe vaccination. The HD-MAP enables the delivery of vaccine directly to the dense populations of skin-resident immune cells enhancing immune responses with potential dose-sparing benefits. The HD-MAP is easy to use, and vaccines can be stable at room temperature, avoiding or minimizing the need for cold-chain refrigeration and facilitating distribution of vaccine patches by mail and courier for potential self-administration. The clinical study includes 258 healthy participants between the ages of 18 and 50 years, making it the largest Phase I trial conducted-to-date by Vaxxas with its HD-MAP technology. The trial will compare the safety and immune response of participants to this H7N9 vaccine, when dosed with Vaxxas’ novel HD-MAP as well as through conventional needle and syringe. Initial results from the trial are expected in 2025 and will be provided to BARDA and published by Vaxxas and its clinical collaborators. “Global pandemic threats require the world’s health organizations to have better and more accessible vaccine delivery options. With potential benefits such as thermostability, ease of use, and patient acceptability, Vaxxas’ HD-MAP is designed to be rapidly and broadly deployed to accelerate vaccination uptake and rates,” David L. Hoey, President and CEO of Vaxxas, said. “Market research indicates that – given the choice – vaccination by HD-MAP is significantly preferred over conventional needle-and-syringe.” The influenza A virus circulates as numerous strains across the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) states the H7N9 avian influenza strain is ‘of concern’ as most patients have become severely ill. This Australian-based Phase I clinical study is being conducted at three of the University of the Sunshine Coast’s clinical trial centers in Queensland and the Doherty Clinical Trial center in Melbourne, Victoria. About Avian influenza A (H7N9) This selected variant of avian influenza A (H7N9), or bird flu, is a subtype of influenza viruses that have been detected in birds, livestock, and people in the past. The World Health Organization (WHO) states the H7N9 avian influenza strain is ‘of concern’ as most patients have become severely ill. H7N9 has an observed Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of 39%, meaning for every 100 infected people 39 people are likely to die and many are likely to become seriously sick. To date, more than 1,500 people have been infected by H7N9 worldwide since early 2013, according to WHO. About HD-MAP needle-free vaccines The Vaxxas high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP) is comprised of thousands of microscopic projections molded into a small patch. Each microprojection is ‘printed’ with a small dose of vaccine in a dried formulation. When applied to the skin, the patch delivers the vaccine to the abundant immune cells that naturally reside immediately below the skin surface. HD-MAP vaccine delivery offers many potential benefits over more traditional ways of administering vaccines. For example, the dried form of the vaccine is more stable at higher temperatures than vaccines in liquid formulations, therefore potentially reducing the need for cold-chain storage and distribution. Vaxxas’s HD-MAPs have proven safe and tolerable in hundreds of trial participants to date, and have been shown to induce equal or greater immune responses to injected vaccines at lower doses. Compared with needle and syringe systems, HD-MAP vaccines are also much easier to administer and are likely to have greater acceptability. Ultimately, HD-MAP patches could enable a future in which vaccine patches could be delivered directly to peoples’ homes, workplaces, and schools for self-administration, avoiding the delay and inconvenience of traditional needle-and-syringe vaccine scheduling and administration. In a pandemic situation, this distribution method could also avoid large groups of people having to congregate in central locations for vaccination, reducing the risk of further infections. About Vaxxas Vaxxas is a privately held biotechnology company focused on enhancing the performance of existing and next-generation vaccines with its proprietary high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP). Vaxxas is targeting initial applications in infectious diseases and oncology. With success in several completed human clinical trials involving more than 500 participants; additional ongoing Phase I clinical studies targeting pandemic influenza, funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Vaxxas’ HD-MAP vaccine delivery platform is advancing toward commercialization. Vaxxas’ core technology was initially developed at The University of Queensland (UQ), and the company was established as a start-up in 2011 by UQ’s commercialization group UniQuest. The company was founded with the completion of an initial equity financing led by OneVentures Innovation Fund I with co-investors Brandon Capital Partners and US-based HealthCare Ventures, followed by a further financing led by OneVentures with UQ joining the most recent financing. OneVentures Innovation Fund I and Brandon BioCatalyst are supported by the Australian Government’s Innovation Investment Fund (IIF) program.

Today, we have our weekly look at the headlines with the AMA's Vice President of Science, Medicine and Public Health, Andrea Garcia. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief experience officer. Welcome back, Andrea. Garcia: Thanks, Todd. It's great to be here. Unger: Well, we got a lot to talk about today. But before we get started, we got a lot of nice feedback on last week's segment from folks in the long COVID community. And I just want to say to the folks out there, if you see something that you like on this or—and especially if you see a physician doing something you really appreciate, give them a shout-out and let them know that you saw the segment. Andrea, today we've got a lot to talk about across bird flu, mpox and the COVID vaccine rollout. And why don't we start with bird flu? There's a concerning new development. What do we need to know? Garcia: Yeah, Todd. This past week was the first human case we saw of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu, that was not tied to a known exposure with a sick or infected animal. This patient was in Missouri. The case was reported by the CDC this past Friday. This does mark the 14th case of H5 reported so far in the U.S. this year, and according to a recent CNN article, the first to be detected through the country's national flu surveillance system as opposed to targeted surveillance of the ongoing bird flu outbreak in animals. This case is still under investigation by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. So, we are waiting to find out more. Unger: Andrea, what do we know about the Missouri patient so far? Garcia: Well, not much is being shared in order to, of course, protect the patient's privacy. But what we know is the person did have underlying medical conditions. And they were hospitalized in late August. At that time, the patient tested positive for influenza A. They were treated with influenza antiviral medication. And they're now recovering at home. When that initial test didn't match seasonal flu, a sample from the patient was sent to the CDC. Confirmatory testing then indicated that the case was a type of bird flu. Flu viruses are classified based on two proteins that sit on the surface of the virus, H protein and a N protein. And a spokesperson from the CDC said the agency had confirmed that the type is H5. They have not yet determined the N protein type. They're working on isolating the virus, reading its genetic sequence. Scientists at the CDC do hope to have more information on the genetics of the virus in the coming days. Unger: Andrea, why is it so important to know the genetic sequence? Garcia: Well, determining that sequence will tell researchers how closely related the virus in this case is to the viruses currently causing outbreaks in chicken, cows and other mammals. There are currently no reported cases of bird flu among cattle in Missouri. But there have been outbreaks in poultry. And I think it's really important to understand as much as we can about the chain of transmission here. There were some experts quoted in a recent U.S.A. Today article. They noted that understanding the origin is really crucial for understanding the threat that the virus may pose to the general public. Acquiring that virus without animal contact does raise concerns because it could be an indication that the virus is evolving to transmit from human to human. But we'll need more information, of course, to know if that's the case. It does not appear that the patient spread the virus to anyone else, as the patient's close contacts have remained asymptomatic throughout that typical observation period. That's good news. And overall, the CDC does still consider the risk to the general public to be low. Unger: That's important information. Any other theories on how this patient might have gotten sick? Garcia: Well, there are a couple that are being reported on in the news. Michael Osterholm, who is a noted public health expert, said it is possible that the patient has a new strain of the virus that they may have gotten after coming into close contact with an infected migratory bird. He pointed out that late summer is when many birds are migrating. So the virus is moving. He said something as simple as a backyard bird feeder could be the kind of exposure that would not be uncommon in this case. I've seen other individuals question whether raw milk could have been the cause in this case. Public health officials have been concerned, of course, about bird flu for some time because it has been lethal in about half of the people known to have contracted it worldwide, though, obviously, the human cases we've seen during the outbreak here in the U.S. have been relatively mild. Just this week, there was an opinion piece published in JAMA that was calling for more investment in public health, including a vaccine strategy to address H5N1 both in the U.S. and abroad. This is, obviously, something we'll continue to watch as more details become available. Unger: And we'll publish a link to that JAMA piece in the description of this episode so you can take a look. Andrea, I want to move on now to another virus that we've been talking about. And that's mpox. There have been some developments over the last several weeks. What's new? Garcia: Well, as a quick refresher, we've been discussing the fact that there are two clades of mpox. Clade II is the clade we saw here in the U.S. as a part of the outbreak we experienced in 2022. It's typically less severe and less deadly. For example, during the outbreak in 2022, more than 99% of people survived their infection, according to the CDC. Although the peak of the clade II mpox outbreak decreased by early 2023, cases do continue to still be reported at low levels in countries today, including the U.S. case counts here have remained pretty consistent at about 250 a month since October of 2023. The CDC does say that the risk to the average person in the U.S. from mpox remains low. But in an updated assessment that was published on August 30, it said that the risk for men who have sex with men, or MSM, with more than one sexual partner is now low to moderate. That same risk does apply to people, regardless of gender, who have sex with MSM. A vaccine is available. And there was a CDC study that indicated that getting two doses of the mpox vaccine does work to prevent many mpox cases and reduce the severity of those symptoms. It is rare for people to get mpox after they've been fully vaccinated or recovered from a prior infection. And this protection is thought to protect against both clades. Unger: What about clade I, the more dangerous of the two? Has there been any additional news there? Garcia: Well, clade I is fueling outbreaks in Africa. The outbreak began in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been the epicenter of that global public health emergency. According to the Associated Press, that first batch of 100,000 vaccines arrived in Congo's capital last Thursday. Another 100,000 were delivered on Saturday. Overall, about 380,000 doses of mpox vaccines have been promised by Western partners, such as the EU and the U.S. And that sounds like a lot. But it's actually less than 15% of the 3 million doses that authorities have said are needed to end the mpox outbreaks in Congo. Unger: Andrea, what are the numbers looking like there? Garcia: Well, according to the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention, since that start of 2024, Congo alone has reported more than 4,900 confirmed mpox cases, with more than 629 associated deaths, according to the WHO. As of last Thursday, there have been more than 24,800 reported cases of clade I mpox overall this year. This is a sharp increase in both infections and fatalities compared to previous years. And I think even more devastating is that most of these infections have been in children under the age of 15. Both of these clades can spread through close contact, including intimate or sexual contact with a person who has mpox, as well as through contact with contaminated materials. The Africa CDC said it's working on a unified response plan for the outbreaks, which will be presented to African heads of state or consideration at a meeting later this month. Unger: Andrea, is the U.S. taking any precautions in case clade I were to come here? Garcia: Yes. And it is possible, of course, that clade I will show up here. As a reminder, travel-related cases of clade I have been confirmed in both Sweden and Thailand already. The U.S. has taken steps to increase testing and surveillance. And they've also tried to help ensure that those vaccines are readily available at local pharmacies and community health centers. In a briefing on Friday, senior U.S. officials said that any physician in the U.S. can now order an mpox test, which can be processed through a national laboratory chain. Positive tests that are not the older strain of mpox will then be sent on to the CDC for confirmatory testing. The government has also added testing for any form of mpox to its wastewater surveillance system and said that there is good coverage in most major cities. As a next step, they're working to add that clade I-specific testing and make rapid tests available. And those tests could be available in the coming months. Unger: Well, thank you for that update on mpox. Andrea, before we wrap up the week, let's do a quick COVID check-in. Last time, we talked about the vaccine rollout. How is that going? Garcia: Well, Todd, there have been some hiccups. And according to an article by NBC News, while major pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens have been able to roll out the vaccine, some of those independent pharmacies and even, we're hearing, some health systems have been waiting for that vaccine to arrive still. Many say they're facing delays in getting their shipments. And that's leading to longer wait times for patients to get vaccinated. Both Pfizer and Moderna have denied prioritizing those larger chains over smaller independent stores and said there is substantial supply available. They did acknowledge that buying the vaccine through wholesalers could slow down the process slightly. Hopefully, we'll begin to see those outlets receiving their shipments sometime this week, though. Unger: And we'll continue to watch the rollout as we head into the fall.

There is a genetic component to their ability to perform at a high level. They eat and drink to fuel their bodies for performance. They live in a comfortable environment, and they do as much as possible to avoid interactions that would cause them to get sick and impair performance.Joel PankowskiManager, Field Technical Services / Arm & Hammer Animal Nutrition GroupEmail Joel PankowskiRelatedAvian influenza identified as illness affecting dairy cows in the SouthwestAvian influenza best practices for dairy farmsClean, consistent feed can improve cow resilienceSound familiar? Think your cows fit that description?Elite athletes are resilient, and your cows need to be that way too. For them to perform at a high level, they need all barriers to productivity removed so they can devote as much energy as possible to fully expressing their genetic potential.What are we building resilience against?There are several factors potentially standing in the way of cow performance. Mycotoxins are one key component. Testing for mycotoxins is important, but it’s the type of mycotoxins we’re looking for. Once we know the type, we can put together a plan to mitigate their impact.Mycotoxins are prevalent in the environment, and so are harmful pathogens such as E. coli, salmonella, clostridia and others. An animal can tolerate the impact of one of those pathogens, but when they team up, the synergies of the combination are difficult to overcome.AdvertisementThe goal is to minimize opportunities for pathogenic insults while taking action through the diet to encourage a better gut health scenario.Tighten cell wall junctionsWhen it comes to building resiliency, we’re talking about improving gut health. And remember, gut health is much more than just rumen function. While what happens in the rumen is critically important, it is also imperative to prevent pathogens from entering the bloodstream. If we can tighten the junctions between cell walls and close the holes that would allow pathogens to enter the bloodstream, we can prevent them from doing damage.Another pathogen has recently become prolific in dairy herds, and that is bovine avian influenza (BAI). While hygiene is critically important to the prevention of BAI, when we shore up gut health and tighten cell junctions, we free up energy to allow cows to take on other pathogenic insults.Animals that are on a good gut health program, nutritionally and from a feed hygiene perspective, tend to be more resilient and able to overcome viral challenges. From a nutrition standpoint, the two areas of interest when building resiliency are bacillus technology and refined functional carbohydrates (RFCs).The first technology is designed to prevent pathogens from impacting the gut. With bacillus technology, a feed additive can be designed specifically to your dairy to impact the pathogens present on your farm. A survey of your farm and surrounding area can give us an idea of the microbial population present. We can then customize a blend of bacillus strains that will be effective at mitigating whatever pathogens are present in the environment.Other technologies that include RFCs are designed to move pathogens through the digestive tract without harming the cow. These products are developed from the yeast cell wall and the resulting ingredients – mannanoligosaccharides (MOS), beta glucans (BG) and other products – can mimic the gut wall so pathogens adhere to them and pass through the gut without harming the cow. Adding a highly refined source of bentonite to the RFCs can help further target mycotoxins specifically.Stay on top of feed hygieneProducers can work with their nutritionist and veterinarian to build resiliency of their herd by adding feed ingredients to optimize nutrition and, ultimately, gut health. Any tool or intervention can get overwhelmed when a population of pathogens soar. When that happens, we stop to take a look at the feeding environment. Here are a few things we look at in a feed hygiene audit: Is the feed mixer clean? Next to the milking parlor, the mixer wagon is the most-used piece of equipment on the dairy. When was the last time it was steam cleaned? Are there dead spots where feed can build up? When were the blades last replaced? What is the pathogen load in your forages? We will test forages and other stored feed to determine if high levels of pathogens are present. A general rule of thumb is the wetter the ingredient, the higher the chance of pathogen and mold contamination. Is your feeding area clean? How often do you clean bunks and feeding pads to remove old feed? These are just a few items relating to feed hygiene. Additionally, a feed hygiene checklist for producers to review to make sure they are using proper feed hygiene techniques to keep pathogens under control should include points such as strengthening immunity, bolstering gut health and binding mycotoxins.It takes an investment to build resiliency in your dairy cows. It takes an investment of time to understand the risk factors involved on your dairy. It’s good to do an assessment of feeding practices and feed hygiene to make sure pathogen loads are limited. Today, with the advent of BAI, a renewed look at biosecurity practices is certainly warranted. You’ve already made an investment in building the genetics of your herd through years and generations of careful matings and adherence to a breeding program. Now it is time to evaluate the return on investment of a higher plane of nutrition that can help your cows – your elite athletes – establish resilience against invasive pathogens and mycotoxins.RelatedAvian influenza identified as illness affecting dairy cows in the SouthwestAvian influenza best practices for dairy farmsClean, consistent feed can improve cow resilienceJoel PankowskiManager, Field Technical Services / Arm & Hammer Animal Nutrition GroupEmail Joel PankowskiKEYWORDS gut health highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) lactobacillus buchneri molds mycotoxin binder mycotoxinsTOPICS Progressive Dairy Feed Management Feed EvaluationBUYER'S GUIDEVISIT OUR BUYER’S GUIDEFinding cows in heat and catching sick cows days before they show clinical signs, makes dairy producers’ lives easier.

The CDC advises getting vaccinated by late October. This year's flu shots cover three strains of the virus. Covid and flu vaccines can be administered at the same time for convenience, though it may slightly increase side effects. Flu season has started, and doctors are exercising on the benefits of taking flu shots. These vaccines are recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older. Doctors advice getting a flu shot either this month or next, as flu cases usually rise in the fall and peak between December and February. The flu vaccine takes about two weeks to be fully effective.You really want to think about getting your appointment or making your plan to get vaccinated sometime around the last half of September through the end of October. This year's flu shots protect against three flu viruses: two types of influenza A and one type of influenza B.Most people need one dose of the flu vaccine. However, children up to 8 years old who haven't been vaccinated before should get two shots at least four weeks apart. Unvaccinated kids should get their first shot quickly. For adults aged 65 and older, certain flu shots that produce a stronger immune response are recommended. Flu vaccination has three options: Fluzone High-Dose, Flublok, or Fluad.You have to really shop around and figure out where thatâs available, because it wonât be available everywhere. The effectiveness of flu vaccines can vary each year. In an optimal year, you get up to about 80% [effectiveness. In a bad year, maybe 30%."People with egg allergies may be concerned about flu vaccines, but they are generally safe. Those with concerns can opt for Flucelvax, which uses mammalian cells instead of eggs in its development.Health experts anticipate that flu and COVID-19 will both be prevalent in the fall and winter. The new COVID-19 vaccines target the KP.2 variant and are recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older. COVID-19 and flu vaccines can be administered simultaneously.You may feel some aches and some chills and maybe a low-grade temperature if you get them both together, but you could also get that from each individually. It is better to delay vaccination if feeling unwell to ensure a full immune response. Flu shots are available at doctorâs offices, pharmacies and health clinics in India.10 simple signs that indicate you are a healthy personAbout the AuthorTOI Lifestyle DeskThe TOI Lifestyle Desk is a dynamic team of dedicated journalists who, with unwavering passion and commitment, sift through the pulse of the nation to curate a vibrant tapestry of lifestyle news for The Times of India readers.

Back to Healio Key takeaways: Infants were less likely to receive oseltamivir if they did not have a fever or had symptoms for more than 48 hours. Providers were less likely to prescribe oseltamivir while waiting for delayed test results. Presence of a fever and time since symptom onset were two factors that affected whether providers prescribed oseltamivir to infants with influenza, according to findings published in Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society. The CDC recommends oseltamivir for infants aged younger than 2 years with confirmed or suspected influenza. Overall, adherence to guidelines is high, but there is still room for improvement, according to researchers. Presence of a fever and time since symptom onset were two factors that affected whether providers prescribed oseltamivir to infants with influenza.

Rick and colleagues conducted a retrospective cohort study that included 457 infants (54% boys) aged younger than 2 years who tested positive for influenza between Jan. 1, 2012, through July 31, 2020. The researchers analyzed how many of these infants received oseltamivir prescriptions and compared prescription rates based on time since symptom onset, presence of fever and type of influenza test. Most of the cases (82.1%) occurred from Aug. 1, 2016, through July 31, 2020, which Rick and colleagues attributed to “the acquisition of additional pediatric practices into our health system and increased alignment of EHRs during this time, as well as increased availability and utilization of [rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDT)] within outpatient and urgent care settings across our health system beginning in 2018.” Two-thirds (68.5%) of the infants were aged 6 months or older and thus eligible for influenza vaccination, but less than one-third (31%) of eligible infants had received two doses of influenza vaccine at the time of influenza diagnosis. Overall, 85.7% of infants received an oseltamivir prescription, with coverage improving throughout the study period, according to the researchers. In the multivariable analysis, the researchers found that infants were less likely to receive an oseltamivir prescription if they did not have a fever at the time of diagnosis (OR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.6) or if they had symptoms for more than 2 days (OR = 9.4; 95% CI, 4.8-18.7). On the issue of timing, Rick and colleagues noted that the CDC and Infectious Diseases Society of America both recommend oseltamivir be given within 48 hours of the start of influenza symptoms, but that “this distinction is removed for high-risk populations including children [younger than] 2 years of age with a positive or suspected influenza diagnosis; instead oseltamivir is recommended as soon as possible.” Infants were four times less likely to be prescribed antivirals if they were diagnosed with influenza between Jan. 1, 2012, and July 31, 2016, compared with infants diagnosed between Aug. 1, 2016, and July 31, 2020 (OR = 4.2; 95% CI, 1.8-9.5). Infants who received a reverse transcriptase PCR test (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-7.1) or a multiplex PCR test or viral culture (OR = 6.7; 95% CI, 2.7-16.3) were more likely not to receive an oseltamivir prescription compared with those who received an RIDT. The increase in oseltamivir prescriptions over time — and greater likelihood of an infant receiving treatment after testing positive via an RIDT — “suggests a gradual adherence to the CDC’s antiviral guidelines after they were updated in 2011 to recommend antiviral treatment be given to children [younger than] 2 years of age as soon as possible,” Rich and colleagues wrote. “If there will be a delay in receiving test results, clinicians should err on the side of presumptive treatment to improve adherence to Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines and ultimately improve outcomes of young children with influenza,” Rick said. “It is important for pediatric clinicians to recognize that all children less than 2 years of age, regardless of any underlying medical conditions, are considered high risk for the complications of influenza, and so prescription of oseltamivir is appropriate when influenza infection is confirmed or suspected regardless of when symptoms started.” Published by: Sources/DisclosuresCollapse Source: Zaheer HA, et al.

Subscribe to our email newsletter Under the terms of the agreement, KM Biologics will carry out the development, manufacturing, and commercialisation of Osivax’s vaccine. KM Biologics will make an upfront payment to Osivax for the execution of the license option. If KM Biologics decides to exercise this option, Osivax will receive an additional upfront payment, along with payments upon the achievement of several development and regulatory milestones, and tiered royalties for each candidate. The financial specifics of the deal, however, remain undisclosed. Osivax CEO and co-founder Alexandre Le Vert said: “We highly value the opportunity to collaborate with KM Biologics, an experienced and established influenza vaccine developer and manufacturer in Japan. “This presents an exciting opportunity for us to expand the reach of our broad-spectrum ‘universal’ influenza vaccine candidates to a country that is at the forefront of seasonal and pandemic flu prevention. “The license option agreement underscores the potential of our oligoDOM technology to generate T-Cell vaccines capable of providing universal protection against current and future influenza strains on a global scale.” In June last year, Osivax began a Phase IIa trial administering the first dose of its vaccine candidate OVX836 to a participant in Australia. This trial aims to recruit over 500 volunteers to receive OVX836 in combination with quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs). Osivax’s OVX836 has undergone testing in four completed clinical trials. The company reported that a separate, recently concluded Phase IIa trial showed OVX836, when combined with QIVs, maintained a good safety profile without impairing the immune response elicited by the QIVs. The ongoing trial in Australia seeks to evaluate the vaccine’s efficacy in a larger and more diverse population.

Thankfully, the patient has recovered, but they are the 14th person to fall ill with bird flu in the US this year, and the first patient with "no immediate known animal exposure", according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All previous human cases were among workers who had contracted the virus from sick animals on poultry or dairy farms. This new case is a mystery the CDC is desperately trying to solve. On August 22, an adult patient tested positive for the avian virus at a hospital in the state of Missouri, where only poultry and wild birds have previously tested positive for the H5N1 strain of the virus. Initially, the patient tested positive for influenza A, but they didn't match any known human subtype. Further testing revealed the patient had somehow picked up the avian influenza, which is currently spreading among wild and domesticated birds and mammals across the US, as well as Europe, South America, Africa, parts of Asia, and the Antarctic. This person had no known contact with animals, although it is possible they were exposed to an infected animal without their knowledge. Officials at the CDC are now sequencing the viral genome of this recent human case to better understand where the pathogen came from and how it might have adapted to infect mammals like ourselves. The patient in Missouri has not passed the virus on to any close contacts, and without any known case of human to human transmission thus far, the CDC still lists the threat of avian flu to the public as "low". "The risk of sustained transmission or infection among the general public remains low," confirms the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. The fact that this patient ended up in hospital is a concerning sign, however; it is unknown at this point whether their severe symptoms were due to the virus itself or to underlying medical conditions. Deputy director of the CDC, Nirav Shah, told The Guardian in an exclusive interview in July that their team is carefully watching for increasing severity of avian flu in humans, as this could indicate the virus is mutating in a way that could be dangerous to public health. "If we were to see individuals with no connection to a farm whatsoever, or chicken exposure, developing signs and symptoms – that would be greatly concerning," Shah said at the time.The recent case in Missouri is the first case of bird flu detected as part of the nation's flu surveillance system, under which curious forms of influenza are sent for further testing.

Unlike the seasonal flu that affects humans, canine influenza can occur year-round. It is caused by two distinct strains of the influenza A virus: H3N8 and H3N2. These strains are relatively new, and as such, most dogs have not developed natural immunity, making them highly susceptible to infection. While canine influenza is not typically fatal, it can lead to serious complications if not promptly addressed, especially in young puppies, senior dogs, and those with pre-existing health conditions. Here’s what you should know about the symptoms, causes, and treatments for the disease. Advertisement Symptoms of canine influenza in dogs (Photo Credit: Felix Andres Montana Otalora | Getty Images) The symptoms of dog flu can range from mild to severe and often mimic those of other respiratory infections, such as kennel cough. Common signs include: Coughing: This can be either a dry, hacking cough or a wet, productive one, and may persist for several weeks. Sneezing: Frequent sneezing is another telltale sign that your dog may have contracted the virus. Nasal and ocular discharge: Runny nose and watery eyes are common and can sometimes be accompanied by a yellow or greenish tint indicating secondary bacterial infection. Lethargy: Infected dogs often display signs of fatigue and a lack of energy. Fever: Dogs with canine influenza may run a fever, with temperatures ranging from 103°F to 105°F. Appetite loss: Reduced appetite and weight loss can also be indicative of the disease. In severe cases, canine influenza can progress to pneumonia, which may be life-threatening if not treated immediately. Causes of canine influenza in dogs (Photo Credit: David Joel | Getty Images) As previously mentioned, dog flu is primarily caused by two specific strains of the influenza A virus: H3N8 and H3N2. The H3N8 strain originally emerged from horses and adapted to infect dogs in the early 2000s. On the other hand, the H3N2 strain is believed to have originated in birds and was first identified in dogs in Asia around 2007 before spreading to the United States in 2015. Both strains are highly contagious and can spread rapidly among dogs through respiratory secretions like coughing, sneezing, and barking. Canine influenza virus (CIV) can also be transmitted indirectly through contaminated objects such as food and water bowls, toys, leashes, bedding, and even the hands or clothing of humans who have had contact with an infected dog. The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 48 hours, on clothing for 24 hours, and on hands for 12 hours. Environmental factors and the density of dog populations play significant roles in the transmission of CIV. Dogs in close contact at dog parks, boarding facilities, grooming salons, or social events are at a higher risk of exposure. Furthermore, infected dogs can shed the virus even before they show any symptoms. This makes it challenging to control the spread once it begins. Although canine influenza can infect dogs of all breeds, ages, and health statuses, those with compromised immune systems or underlying health issues are more susceptible to contracting the virus and may experience more severe symptoms. How is canine influenza diagnosed? (Photo Credit: bluecinema | Getty Images) If you suspect your dog might have the flu, take them to a veterinarian as soon as possible. During your visit, your vet will start with a detailed history, asking you about your dog’s symptoms, recent exposures to other dogs, and any relevant travel history. A physical examination will follow, where they will check for signs such as coughing, nasal discharge, and fever. To confirm the diagnosis, your vet might recommend specific tests like PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) assays, which detect the presence of the virus’s genetic material in nasal or throat swabs. Another option could be serological tests that measure the levels of antibodies against the virus in your dog’s blood, indicating either a current or past infection. In some cases, a chest X-ray may be necessary to assess secondary bacterial infections or the extent of lung involvement, especially if pneumonia is suspected. These tests are essential because the symptoms of canine influenza can resemble other respiratory illnesses, and an accurate diagnosis is necessary to ensure your dog receives the appropriate treatment. Treatments for canine influenza in dogs (Photo Credit: Photoboyko | Getty Images) While there is no specific antiviral treatment approved for canine influenza, supportive care and management strategies can significantly alleviate symptoms and aid in recovery. Here are some steps you can take to help your dog recover from the flu: Rest and hydration: Rest is crucial for your dog to recuperate. Ensure your pet has a comfortable, quiet space where they can relax. Keeping them hydrated is equally important. Offer fresh water regularly and consider using a pet-safe electrolyte solution if your vet approves. Medications: Your vet may prescribe medications to help manage your dog’s symptoms. These could include anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce fever and discomfort, or antibiotics if there’s a secondary bacterial infection. Follow the dosage instructions carefully and complete the full course of any prescribed medication, even if your dog starts feeling better. Nutritional support: A well-balanced diet is essential for your dog’s recovery. If your pet has lost their appetite, try offering bland, easy-to-digest foods like boiled chicken and rice. You might also consider using a high-calorie nutritional supplement, but always check with your vet before making any dietary changes. Isolation: After exposure to the virus, it typically takes two to four days for clinical signs to appear. This duration is known as the incubation period. While most dogs recover from the flu within two to three weeks, those infected with H3N2 must be isolated for 21 days, and dogs with H3N8 should be isolated for a minimum of seven days, as they may still remain infectious during this period. As such, make sure your pet has their own bedding, toys, and feeding area to minimize contact with other animals. How to protect your dog from canine influenza? (Photo Credit: NickyLloyd | Getty Images) Prevention is always better than cure. Here’s how you can ensure your pet stays safe and protected from canine influenza: Vaccinate your dog: The first and most effective step in protecting your dog from canine influenza is vaccination. Speak with your veterinarian about the available vaccines for dog flu. Avoid high-risk areas: Canine influenza is often spread in places where dogs are in close contact with each other. If there’s an outbreak in your area, it might be wise to limit your dog’s exposure to these high-risk environments. Socialization is important, but your dog’s health should come first during an outbreak. Practice good hygiene: Similar to human flu, maintaining good hygiene practices can help prevent the spread of canine influenza. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after petting other dogs or handling objects that may be contaminated. Clean your dog’s belongings — such as food and water bowls, toys, and bedding — regularly with hot water and pet-safe disinfectants. If you have multiple dogs, ensure they each have their own set of items to minimize the risk of cross-contamination. Boost your dog’s immunity: A strong immune system can help your dog fight off infections more effectively. Ensure your dog has a balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, and consider supplements if recommended by your vet. Regular exercise and a stress-free environment also play a vital role in maintaining a healthy immune system. Stay informed: Stay up-to-date with information about canine influenza in your area. Local veterinary offices, animal shelters, and pet organizations often provide alerts and updates about outbreaks. Being informed will help you take timely precautions to protect your dog. Which vaccines are available for canine influenza? Currently, vaccines from Zoetis® and Nobivac® are available which simultaneously target both strains of the canine influenza virus. For the primary immunization, these vaccines are usually given in a series of two shots, administered two to four weeks apart. This is followed by an annual booster shot to maintain immunity. Puppies as young as seven to eight weeks old can start their vaccination series, which is particularly important if they will be exposed to environments where the virus is prevalent. Remember, while the vaccine might not entirely prevent infection, it significantly reduces the severity and duration of the disease. The vaccines work by stimulating your dog’s immune system to produce antibodies against the virus, offering them a better chance of fighting off an infection if they are exposed. As with any medical intervention, there can be side effects associated with the dog flu vaccine. Most commonly, you might notice mild symptoms such as lethargy, a slight fever, or localized swelling at the injection site. These reactions are usually short-lived and subside within a day or two. Severe reactions are rare but can include allergic responses like hives, facial swelling, or difficulty breathing. Always keep an eye on your dog after their vaccination and consult your vet if you notice any worrying symptoms. It’s also a good idea to discuss the benefits and risks of the vaccine with your vet to make an informed decision tailored to your pet’s specific needs and lifestyle.

Manage alerts for this article Email this article Share this article CDC and NIAID By Helen Branswell Sept. 8, 2024 Senior Writer, Infectious Diseases News that a person in Missouri contracted H5 bird flu despite having no known contact with infected animals or birds — in other words, no evident route of infection — raises pressing questions public health officials are surely scurrying to answer. The rationale for that urgency is this: An unexplained H5 infection raises the possibility of person-to-person spread of a flu virus that has never before circulated in humans, and to which people would not have immunity. And this with a dangerous flu virus that scientists have long feared could someday trigger a pandemic.advertisement After all, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was first noticed when two children in California who had no contact with pigs or with each other were diagnosed with flu infections caused by a virus that had previously been circulating in swine. To be clear, it is far too soon to conclude this infection can’t be linked to some direct or indirect exposure to infected animals or birds, or to some farm product contaminated with the virus. But there are, as we noted, questions that need to be answered, and the sooner the better. Here are five.advertisement What is being done to investigate the situation? Word of the infection emerged late Friday when the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services issued a press release, followed shortly by a statement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; neither provided much information. The CDC statement said Missouri was conducting the on-the-ground investigation to look for the source of the individual’s infection. Related Story Missouri resident who had no contact with animals tests positive for bird flu Flu experts watching from afar are puzzled by the seeming lack of urgency. They wonder why the CDC hasn’t sent a team to the state, and why health officials waited so long to make the case public. (The CDC cannot of its own accord send a team of investigators; it must be asked for help by state authorities.) Their concerns add to criticism that the entire U.S. response to the outbreak of H5N1 viruses in dairy cattle has been lethargic; a number of critics have suggested if this outbreak were happening elsewhere, the U.S. would be up in arms about the tenor of the response. The concern is that if the virus, which is genetically wired to infect birds, adapts to be able to spread efficiently among mammals, that brings it a big step closer to being able to transmit among people. “I would want to see a ‘better safe than sorry’ investigation,” said Marion Koopmans, head of the department of viroscience at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, said about the response to the Missouri case. For Koopmans, what is being done to crack the mystery of how this person was infected tops the list of questions that need to be answered. “I would want to see a wide net cast here,” she said, such as looking to see if there is any evidence of hidden chains of person-to-person transmission of the virus. It “does not have to be all in the public eye, but I would want to know this is [being] taken up very seriously.” The fact that the case was only announced publicly two weeks after the individual was hospitalized, and after the person had recovered and was discharged, seems like a missed opportunity to Angela Rasmussen, a virologist who specializes in emerging infectious diseases at at the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Saskatoon, Canada. Local doctors should have been alerted quickly so they could be on the lookout for other such cases, she said.advertisement “If there is human-to-human transmission, it is critical to carry out the [epidemiologic] investigation as rapidly and efficiently as possible, so the choice to drag their feet and give no details about follow up is mystifying and reflects very poorly on both Missouri state and federal epidemic response capacity and practice,” Rasmussen told STAT in an email. Thomas Peacock would like to know if people investigating the case have or are planning to draw blood samples from close contacts of the infected person to look for evidence of H5 infections that might have gone undetected. Peacock is an influenza virologist at Britain’s Pirbright Institute, which focuses on controlling viral illnesses in animals. Related Story USDA faulted for disclosing scant information about outbreaks of H5N1 avian flu in cattle He believes another explanation will eventually be arrived at, but if it turns out this case involved human-to-human transmission, “the U.S. can’t just sit on its thumbs anymore.” Is this the same H5 virus that is spreading in cows? The outbreak in dairy cattle has infected nearly 200 herds in 14 states — that we know of. Missouri hasn’t reported any infections in cows. However, farmers in many places have refused to test their cows. So there could be a lot more of the virus in the country than is currently known. The virus causing the outbreak in cows is highly pathogenic avian influenza — sometimes shortened to HPAI — of the H5N1 subtype. That’s a family of viruses. The specific version in cows is called clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13. As of Friday, all that was known about the Missouri case was that the individual was infected with an H5 virus. The CDC was still working to try to figure out the neuraminidase of the virus, the N of its name. Sometimes that isn’t possible, for instance if there isn’t a lot of virus in the sample from the patient. The CDC is also working to record the genetic sequence of the virus. A sequence could help solve the source of the virus, by allowing a comparison of the virus from the person to other known versions of the virus. advertisement Newsletter Weekdays Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address.

And probably if it is, it’s the bovine one, because there’s just a ton of that out at the moment,” said Peacock. Rasmussen noted that knowing the N number of the virus is important because influenza A viruses — H5N1 is a flu A virus — can swap genes with each other, creating what are known as reassortants. That process could create a new virus that is better able to infect people, she said. How sick was this individual? Was he or she hospitalized for influenza symptoms, or for other reasons? The Missouri press release gives very sparse details about the infected individual, and says that for patient privacy, no additional information will be forthcoming. The individual who tested positive went into the hospital on Aug. 22. The person had “underlying medical conditions” — though there are no details about how many, and how serious they are. There is no indication of the person’s age, though if it were a child, the press release likely would have said so. It states that the person recovered and was discharged from the hospital. It doesn’t indicate for how long the person was hospitalized or whether any of that time was spent in intensive care. Related Story Three months into bird flu outbreak in U.S. dairy cows, experts see deep-rooted problems in response Why does it matter how ill the person was, and whether it was the flu that prompted the hospitalization or something else? There have been 13 other H5 cases in the U.S. this year, all directly or indirectly related to the outbreak in cows. All of these people had very mild illnesses. If this individual’s H5 infection was severe enough to require hospitalization, that broadens the picture of the spectrum of illness that 2.3.4.4b B3.13 viruses can trigger. And it would suggest we shouldn’t assume we know how this virus would behave, if it starts to spread among people. “It is important to know what this [illness] looks like in people, as well as to understand underlying medical conditions that might change a patient’s risk profile,” Rasmussen said.advertisement Did this person truly have no contact with infected animals or birds? Does this individual have a cat that is allowed outdoors? The press releases issued by the state and the CDC stressed that this is the first H5 case in the country in a person without an occupational exposure to infected cows or poultry. “The patient has reported no exposure to animals,” Missouri said. But is it possible the person had indirect exposure, for instance, contact with farmworkers who might have been exposed to infected poultry or cows? Some suspected H5N1 transmission events between people in other countries have occurred among people whose close household contacts interacted with infected animals, Peacock noted. Other experts have questioned whether the individual had bird feeders, which could potentially have exposed him or her to wild bird droppings. They have also wondered whether the household had any cats. There have been a number of reports of infected cats on farms with H5N1-infected dairy cows, assumed to be caused by consumption of infected milk. Cats also could become infected through encounters with infected wild birds. Did this person consume raw milk? One of the big questions in social media discussions among scientists this weekend is whether this individual drank raw milk, or consumed raw milk products. Unpasteurized milk from infected cows contains extraordinarily high amounts of the virus. Laboratory experiments have shown feeding contaminated raw milk to mice can induce severe disease. Many of the farms with infected cats have reported deaths among the animals. It’s not known what risks drinking H5N1-laced milk pose for people but scientists have been worried it could induce disease. Peacock, for one, is surprised that infections linked to raw milk consumption haven’t been identified yet. “The obvious question I would ask is: Have you ruled out that they’re not someone who’s got a big tub of raw milk in their fridge? Because that just seems like such an obvious route for a cryptic infection,” he said.advertisement Rasmussen agreed that exploring this possibility is critical, saying “if this is [due to] raw milk consumption, this would be very valuable information to have about the feasibility and risk of this exposure route.” CDC, H5N1 Bird Flu, infectious disease, public health Submit a correction requestReprints Helen Branswell Senior Writer, Infectious Diseases Helen Branswell covers issues broadly related to infectious diseases, including outbreaks, preparedness, research, and vaccine development.

The vaccine’s effectiveness for the 2022–2023 season was estimated at 54%, marking the highest effectiveness since 2013. Vaccination Rates: Approximately 46.9% of U.S. adults were vaccinated against the flu during the 2022–2023 season, showing a decrease of 2.5 percentage points from the previous season’s 49.4%. For children aged 6 months to 17 years, the vaccination rate held steady at 57.4%, similar to the 57.8% in the 2021–22 season. Specifically, flu vaccination coverage was 65.6% for children aged 6 months to 4 years, 59.3% for those aged 5 to 12 years, and 49.0% for adolescents aged 13 to 17 years, all maintaining similar levels to the previous season. The overall vaccination rate in the 2022–23 season was 6.3 percentage points lower than the pre-pandemic season of 2019–2020, which had a rate of 63.7%. Impact of Flu Vaccination: During the 2019-2020 flu season, vaccinations prevented roughly 7 million flu illnesses, 3 million flu-related medical visits, 100,000 hospitalizations, and 7,000 flu-related deaths. A 2021 study highlighted that vaccinated adults hospitalized with flu had a 26% lower chance of ICU admission and a 31% lower risk of death compared to those unvaccinated. According to a 2018 study, vaccinated adults were 59% less likely to be admitted to the ICU due to flu, and if admitted, they spent four fewer days in the hospital on average than unvaccinated patients. A 2020 study showed that flu vaccinations reduced hospitalizations by 41% and emergency department visits by half among children aged 6 months to 17 years during the 2018-2019 season. Research from 2022 indicated that flu vaccinations lowered the risk of severe, life-threatening influenza in children by 75%. Emerging Trends mRNA-based Vaccines: Leveraging the success seen with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, mRNA technology is now being adapted for influenza vaccines. This approach allows for rapid and flexible manufacturing, potentially enhancing the match between the vaccine strains and circulating viruses. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has invested significantly in this technology, with Moderna leading advancements. This trend underscores the potential of mRNA vaccines in improving responses to influenza outbreaks and pandemic preparedness. Virus-like Particle (VLP) Vaccines: VLP vaccines are at the forefront of influenza prevention strategies. They mimic the virus’s structure but lack genetic material, which means they cannot cause infection. This type of vaccine stimulates both T-cell and B-cell immune responses, offering the possibility of broader protection against the flu. Their flexible formulation capabilities make VLP vaccines a promising option in the ongoing evolution of flu prevention. Recombinant Hemagglutinin (HA) Vaccines: Sanofi Pasteur’s Flublok is an example of a recombinant HA vaccine, which utilizes cutting-edge technology to produce hemagglutinin proteins more quickly than traditional methods. This approach not only speeds up vaccine production but also minimizes the risk of mutations that can occur with egg-based production processes. Recombinant HA vaccines are particularly crucial in rapidly responding to pandemic threats. Adjuvanted and High-Dose Vaccines: There is growing interest in adjuvanted and high-dose influenza vaccines, particularly for vulnerable populations such as the elderly or those with compromised immune systems. These vaccines, including formulations like HD-IIV3 and aIIV3, are designed to elicit a stronger immune response, which is vital for protecting these high-risk groups effectively. Use Cases Seasonal Flu Prevention: Influenza vaccines are crucial for seasonal flu prevention. Each year, these vaccines are updated to match the most common flu strains anticipated for the upcoming season. This proactive approach is vital, as it helps to significantly reduce the number of flu-related hospitalizations and deaths. In the United States alone, the flu can lead to as many as 710,000 hospitalizations and 52,000 deaths annually. By maintaining up-to-date vaccinations, communities can better manage and minimize the impact of seasonal flu outbreaks. Pandemic Preparedness: The development of mRNA and recombinant vaccine platforms has revolutionized pandemic preparedness. These technologies allow for the swift production of vaccines, which is crucial in responding to pandemic flu strains. This rapid response capability can enhance the effectiveness of vaccines against emerging strains, offering a critical advantage over more traditional vaccine production methods that are often slower. Protecting High-risk Populations: Influenza vaccines are particularly important for high-risk groups, such as older adults and individuals with compromised immune systems. Special vaccine formulations, like high-dose vaccines, are designed to elicit a stronger immune response. This enhanced protection is essential for these vulnerable populations, helping to prevent severe influenza complications and safeguard their health more effectively. Global Health Equity: Addressing global health equity is a key use case for influenza vaccines. Efforts to include diverse demographic groups in vaccine trials and to improve access to vaccinations worldwide are crucial. These initiatives aim to eliminate disparities in vaccination rates and health outcomes, especially among racial and ethnic minority populations. Through such inclusive practices, global health communities strive to ensure equitable health protections for all individuals, regardless of background. Conclusion The global Influenza Vaccine Market is set to experience robust growth, primarily driven by advancements in vaccine technology and expanded vaccination guidelines. The introduction of updated vaccines and the incorporation of various vaccine types cater to diverse health needs, ensuring broader demographic coverage.

PDF FILE The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has been actively defending its response to the recent outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza, emphasizing the measures taken to protect both livestock and public health. The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has implemented a series of actions aimed at controlling the spread of the virus and mitigating its impact on the agricultural sector. One of the key steps taken by the USDA is the issuance of a Federal Order requiring mandatory testing for the interstate movement of dairy cattle. This measure ensures that dairy cattle are tested for Influenza A virus before being transported across state lines, thereby preventing the spread of the virus to new areas. Additionally, the USDA has mandated that laboratories and state veterinarians report any positive test results for Influenza A in livestock to APHIS. This reporting requirement helps the USDA track the spread of the virus and respond more effectively. The USDA has also been working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to analyze the virus and assess its potential impact on both animals and humans. In one instance, a shift in an H5N1 sample from a cow in Kansas indicated a possible adaptation of the virus to mammals. However, further analysis by the CDC did not change the overall risk assessment for the general public. In addition to these measures, the USDA has announced financial support for producers affected by the outbreak. This includes assistance for improving on-site biosecurity to reduce the spread of the virus and financial tools to compensate for lost milk production in affected herds. The USDA is also providing support for the development of biosecurity plans based on existing secure milk supply plans. The USDA’s response to the H5N1 outbreak has been characterized by swift action and collaboration with federal partners. Following the first detection of H5N1 in dairy cattle in the Texas panhandle region, the USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) began tracing animal movements, sampling herds to assess disease prevalence, and initiating testing activities to ensure the safety of the meat and milk supplies. The USDA has leveraged the latest scientific data, field epidemiology, and risk assessments to mitigate risks to workers, the general public, and the livestock industry. Despite these efforts, the USDA has faced criticism from some quarters regarding the speed and effectiveness of its response. However, USDA officials have defended their actions, pointing out that the response to the current outbreak has been faster and on a larger scale compared to previous outbreaks. The USDA continues to engage with partners and stakeholders to refine its response strategies and ensure the health and safety of both animals and humans. In conclusion, the USDA’s response to the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak has involved a comprehensive set of measures aimed at controlling the spread of the virus and supporting affected producers. Through mandatory testing, reporting requirements, financial support, and collaboration with federal partners, the USDA is working to protect the livestock industry and public health from the threat posed by this highly pathogenic virus.

Are you and your patients prepared? Public concern for the flu has diminished since after the COVID-19 pandemic, despite millions of cases each year. The CDC estimates that from October 1, 2023 to June 15, 2024, there were up to 830,000 flu hospitalizations and up to 72,000 flu deaths in the United States.[1] The flu remains a serious public health threat, and there is data to suggest this year could be more severe: Flu seasons are highly unpredictable. After two years of limited flu activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2022-2023 flu season saw a sharp increase in hospitalizations.[1] During the upcoming 2024-2025 flu season, the United States may again face a resurgence of flu, and the possibility the season will include influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) at the same time.[1],[2],[3] Vaccination rates have been on a steady decline. In fact, during the 2023-2024 flu season, there were about 63 million influenza shots administered compared to 81 million administered in the 2020-2021 flu season.[4] Flu vaccination remains one of the best preventative tools to reduce the burden of flu illness and its potentially serious complications, like hospitalization.[5] This is especially important for those who are high risk, including older adults, and those living with a chronic illness, including asthma, heart disease, and diabetes.[6],[7],[8],[9] Among people hospitalized with flu in the 2023-2024 season, ~90% had at least one chronic medical condition.[10] Provider trust and perception of risk are important factors to address to encourage vaccine uptake, therefore it’s critical for healthcare professionals to have open conversations with their patients about vaccination options and recommendations.[11] It’s important to consider long-standing data when recommending vaccinations to patients. Flu vaccination has been shown to help reduce the risk of getting sick with flu or help reduce the risk of having a serious flu outcome, like requiring a stay in the hospital.[12] Sanofi’s Fluzone High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine) has been proven to better help protect people 65 years of age and older against flu and its complications and has more antigens than the standard dose.[13],[14],[15] In a clinical study conducted in 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 in approximately 32,000 adults 65+, Fluzone High-Dose was 24% (95% CI: 10-37) more effective (rVE against influenza due to ANY lab-confirmed circulating strains) at preventing the flu than standard-dose Fluzone (Influenza Vaccine).[15] The prespecified statistical superiority criterion for the primary endpoint (lower limit of 2-sided 95% CI of the vaccine efficacy of Fluzone High-Dose relative to Fluzone >9.1%) was met.[15] Solicited systemic adverse reactions and solicited injection-site reactions were slightly more frequent after vaccination with Fluzone High-Dose as compared with Fluzone in a phase 3 safety study conducted during the 2006-2007 season.[16] Flublok and Fluzone High-Dose are vaccines indicated for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by influenza A subtype viruses and type B virus contained in the vaccine. Flublok is approved for use in persons 18 years of age and older. Fluzone High-Dose is approved for use in persons 65 years of age and older. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR FLUBLOK® (INFLUENZA VACCINE) and FLUZONE® HIGH-DOSE (INFLUENZA VACCINE) Do not administer Flublok or Fluzone High-Dose to anyone with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine (including egg protein for Fluzone High-Dose). Fluzone High-Dose should not be administered to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction after previous dose of any influenza vaccine. Please see additional Important Safety Information below. Additionally: Sanofi Fluzone High-Dose (Influenza Vaccine) has over 12 years of data demonstrating protection against the flu and its complications.[17] Fluzone High-Dose and Flublok were designated as one of the preferred recommended options for adults over 65 in the beginning of 2022 by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).[18] Sanofi utilizes egg-based and recombinant technologies, which offer options for a variety of patients.[14],[19] In a clinical study of approximately 9,000 people conducted during 2014-2015 flu season, FLUBLOK® QUADRIVALENT (Influenza Vaccine) was proven to be 30% more effective at preventing flu in people 50+ vs FLUARIX® QUADRIVALENT (a standard-dose vaccine). The efficacy of Flublok (quadrivalent) is relevant to Flublok (trivalent) because both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.[19],[20] Most common adverse events in the Flublok group in adults aged 50-64 included injection-site reactions; tenderness and pain as well as systemic adverse reactions; headache, fatigue, and muscle pain.[16],[19] No two flu seasons are the same and we must be prepared for the unexpected. Go to SanofiFlu.com to learn more about Flublok and Fluzone High-Dose. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR FLUBLOK® (INFLUENZA VACCINE) AND FLUZONE® HIGH-DOSE (INFLUENZA VACCINE) (con’t) Do not administer Flublok or Fluzone High-Dose to anyone with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine (including egg protein for Fluzone High-Dose). Fluzone High-Dose should not be administered to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction after previous dose of any influenza vaccine. Appropriate medical treatment must be immediately available to manage potential anaphylactic reactions following administration of the vaccine. If Guillain-Barré syndrome has occurred within 6 weeks following previous influenza vaccination, the decision to give Flublok or Fluzone High-Dose should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks. If Flublok or Fluzone High-Dose are administered to immunocompromised persons, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, the expected immune response may not be attained. Vaccination with Flublok or Fluzone High-Dose may not protect all recipients. Syncope (fainting) has been reported following vaccination with Flublok and Fluzone High-Dose. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. For Flublok, in adults 18 through 64 years of age, the most common injection site adverse reaction was pain; the most common solicited systemic adverse reactions were headache, fatigue, and myalgia. In adults 65 years of age and older, the most common injection-site adverse reaction was pain; the most common solicited systemic adverse reactions were fatigue and headache. For Fluzone High-Dose, in adults 65 years of age and older, the most common injection-site reaction was pain; the most common solicited systemic adverse reactions were myalgia, malaise, and headache. For Flublok and Fluzone High-Dose, other adverse reactions may occur. Please see the full Prescribing Information for Flublok and Fluzone High-Dose.

By Teresa Maalouf, MPH Updated on September 13, 2024 Medically reviewed by Kate Colby, MPH Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Annual Flu Deaths When Is It Fatal? Who’s at Risk? Preparation Treatment Close Influenza, commonly known as "the flu," is a virus that affects millions of people in the United States each year. Most people recover after a short bout of illness. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that between 1999 and 2022, 1.8 of every 100,000 people in the U.S. who got the flu died from it. The severity of the flu, and its subsequent impact, changes from year to year. Older people, young children, pregnant people, and people with certain underlying health conditions are at a higher risk of complications from the flu. This article provides flu mortality rates and discusses the warning signs, risk factors, and treatments for the flu. Illustration by Michela Buttignol for Verywell Health Annual Flu Deaths Annual flu deaths vary from year to year. Between 2010 and 2023, yearly flu deaths have been as low as 4,900 and as high as 51,000. A number of factors contribute to the variation, including: Flu vaccination rates Seasonal flu vaccine efficacy Timing of the flu season Characteristics of the virus How It’s Spread When a person coughs, sneezes, or talks, they expel droplets from their bodies. The flu is spread when infected droplets land in the nose or mouth of someone who isn't sick. It's also possible to get the flu by touching an infected surface and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth, but it's far less common. If you've ever been outside when it's so cold that you can see your breath, this will help you visualize how the flu is spread. It typically appears as a concentrated cloud that travels about 6 feet from your body before it dissipates. The droplets are more concentrated closest to the body and become less concentrated as they move away. This is why the CDC recommends that sick people stay home and not have contact with others—or maintain at least a 6 foot distance when in necessary contact—to reduce the risk of spread. Causes and Risk Factors of the Flu Flu Contagious Period The flu can be spread one day before symptoms start and up to 5-7 days thereafter in people with a healthy immune system. It's most contagious in the first 3-4 days after the illness begins. People with a weakened immune system or young children may be able to spread it longer, since their bodies are not as well-equipped to fight off a virus. How Long Is the Flu Contagious? Asymptomatic Spread It's possible for people who are asymptomatic, meaning they have no symptoms at all, to spread the flu. When Is Influenza Fatal? Although most people will recover from the flu within about two weeks or less, complications of the flu can cause influenza to become fatal. Complications of the flu include: Pneumonia Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) Myositis or rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue inflammation) Multi-organ failure Sepsis The flu can also make certain chronic medical conditions worse, leading to increased risk for complications and death. Recognizing the warning signs of the flu will help you to know when it's time to seek medical treatment. The CDC provides the following warning signs of the flu in children and adults: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Persistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen Persistent dizziness, confusion, or inability to be active Seizures Inability to urinate Severe muscle pain, weakness, or unsteadiness Fever or cough that improves and then returns or worsens Worsening of existing chronic conditions Young children may see these additional signs: Bluish lips or face Ribs pulling in with breath Chest pain Dehydration Who’s at Risk? People most at risk for flu complications include: People with chronic medical conditions, like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDS Pregnant people Adults over age 65 Children under 5 years Infants Talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have about your risk for the flu and what you can do to protect yourself. Groups at High Risk for Dangerous Flu Complications Preparing for Flu Season The influenza virus mutates (changes) each year. This evolving virus requires a new version of the vaccine each year to work against it. Getting a flu vaccine is the most effective way to prepare yourself for flu season. Benefits of Flu Vaccination A 2021 study found that adults who had received the flu vaccine and were hospitalized for flu were 26% less likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) than those who hadn't received the flu vaccine. The same study reported that people who were vaccinated and hospitalized for flu-related illness were 31% less likely to die from flu-related illness than those who were unvaccinated. Additional steps to help you prepare for flu season include: Avoid contact with people who are sickStay home if you are sickPractice good hygiene by washing your hands regularlyCover your mouth when you cough or sneezeRegularly clean and disinfect commonly touched surfacesAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth Verywell / Ellen Lindner Flu Treatment The flu can be treated at home with medications used to reduce fevers. You can also treat your flu symptoms by: Staying properly hydratedGetting lots of restStaying home from school or work for at least 24 hours after your fever has resolved A healthcare provider may prescribe an antiviral drug to someone who is very sick or at a greater risk of complications from the flu. Antivirals are used to stop the virus from making copies of itself, thus reducing the severity and duration of the illness. These medications can reduce symptom duration by about a day, and are most effective when started within one to two days of illness onset. Summary Unfortunately, the flu can be deadly, especially for those in high-risk groups such as older adults and people with chronic health conditions. But in the majority of cases, the flu is not deadly. Understanding how the flu virus is spread is the first step in understanding how to protect yourself from it. Getting your annual flu vaccine is the best measure of protection. Adding in additional precautions such as regular hand washing and avoiding people who are sick will help to keep you safe and healthy. A Word From Verywell It's valid to be scared of getting the flu and wondering what might happen if you do. Talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns, especially if you fall into a high risk category. Fortunately, you now know the major warning signs to look for and that early treatment within the first one or two days can treat the flu. 10 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email HEALTH First case of human bird flu diagnosed without exposure to infected animals, CDC says Amid the Missouri patient’s bout with the virus, infectious disease experts share concerns By Melissa Rudy Fox News Published September 9, 2024 2:50pm EDT Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for September 9 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A patient in Missouri was hospitalized with bird flu despite having no known contact with animals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the positive case of avian influenza A (H5) on Friday.The patient, who had underlying medical conditions, was successfully treated with antiviral medications at the hospital and has since been discharged, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS). 3 DEATHS REPORTED AFTER LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE OUTBREAK AT SENIOR LIVING FACILITY This marks the 14th person (in three states) to contract bird flu in the U.S. this year — and the first infection to occur without any reported exposure to sick or infected animals, the CDC alert stated. The prior 13 cases came after exposure to dairy cows or poultry. The CDC has confirmed the positive case of avian influenza A (H5) without any known exposure to animals. (iStock)Dr. Benjamin Anderson, assistant professor in the Department of Environmental and Global Health at the University of Florida, said the fact that an individual has tested positive for H5 without any reported animal exposure is "very concerning," but noted that very little is known about the case. "We don’t know if the individual had indirect exposure to people or products from agricultural settings," he told Fox News Digital. VALLEY FEVER OUTBREAK REPORTED AFTER CALIFORNIA MUSIC FESTIVAL AS HEALTH OFFICIALS CITE 'HOTSPOT' "We also do not yet know the sequence of the virus to determine if it is related to the strains circulating in dairy cattle or not." A full epidemiological investigation is necessary to determine all potential paths of exposure, Anderson said."If our cases of influenza A spike, we need to test more samples to see if some are avian influenza." "This is definitely something we need to pay very close attention to."Dr. Edward Liu, chief of infectious diseases at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, echoed the concern about human-to-human spread. "When that happens, you won't see an animal vector or source," he told Fox News Digital. A full epidemiological investigation is necessary to determine all potential paths of exposure, said an infectious disease expert. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo)"One of the underlying concerns is that the avian influenza will adapt itself to be more efficient at replicating in humans and better at spreading in respiratory droplets and secretions."Liu also emphasized that current testing for avian influenza is limited. WHAT IS EEE, THE MOSQUITO-BORNE DISEASE THAT KILLED A NEW HAMPSHIRE MAN? "Knowing it is influenza A doesn't mean it is avian influenza," he said. "The confirmation of avian influenza requires another step to send it to the state health department or CDC — so we may be measuring the tip of an iceberg. If our cases of influenza A spike, we need to test more samples to see if some are avian influenza." This marks the 14th person to contract bird flu in the U.S. this year. The prior 13 cases came after exposure to dairy cows or poultry. (iStock) Dr. Marc Siegel, senior medical analyst for Fox News and clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, noted that while there hasn’t been evidence of animal exposure, "most likely there was.""There has been no evidence of any human-to-human spread at this point," he told Fox News Digital. "Surveillance, wastewater analysis and control in animals are key."Risk factors The biggest concern for bird flu right now, according to Anderson, is the potential for it to evolve and gain human-to-human transmission ability. "Influenza viruses can evolve over time through the accumulation of small point mutations in their genetic sequence," he said. "However, they can also evolve very rapidly through what is called recombination — when two or more influenza viruses infecting the same host exchange their genetic material and make a new strain of virus." COVID VACCINE DISTRUST GROWING AMONG AMERICANS, SURVEY FINDS: ‘SHOULD BE A PERSONAL CHOICE’ The more this strain of influenza virus circulates, the greater the potential for recombination to occur, the doctor said. "Right now, the highest-risk human groups are individuals with dairy cow and poultry exposure in areas where spillovers of bird flu have been documented," Anderson said. Bird flu is not currently in the seasonal influenza vaccine, although the immunization may still provide some protection, one expert said. (iStock)So far, those who have contracted the dairy cow strain of influenza virus have mostly had mild infections, the doctor noted. "However, we know these viruses change quickly, so we need to continue to be vigilant in monitoring their circulation."

"It is not currently in our seasonal influenza vaccine, although the vaccine may still provide some protection," he said. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER "Luckily, current prescription antivirals, like Tamiflu, can still treat avian influenza." As with other flu strains, avian influenza will likely pose a greater risk to older patients, young children, immunocompromised patients, and those with chronic lung, cardiac or kidney disease, the doctor added."If it starts to pass from human to human, it could be a huge problem, but we aren't there." Overall, Siegel said, bird flu poses "no current concern unless it mutates further.""It needs to be monitored closely," he added. "If it starts to pass from human to human, it could be a huge problem, but we aren't there."

Here’s why they also need stronger vaccinesBYLindsey LeakeAdults 65 and older should get their annual flu shot between mid-September and early October, according to Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.Jasmin Merdan—Getty ImagesFlu season is nigh, and if you’re 65 or older, don’t dally on getting your updated 2024–25 vaccine. Seasonal flu activity in the U.S. typically peaks between December and February, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends everyone aged 6 months and older get their annual shot by Halloween. However, Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, encourages older adults to protect themselves a bit earlier. “For older adults and for folks who’ve got chronic medical problems, I usually recommend getting the flu vaccine around anytime from the middle of September through early October,” Hopkins previously told Fortune. “Because in those of us with immune systems that aren’t quite as robust, we want to make sure that we vaccinate at a time that’s likely to give us immune protection throughout the flu season.” In addition to young children, pregnant people, and those with chronic conditions such as diabetes, older adults are at increased risk of serious flu complications. That’s because as you age, your immune system slows and weakens. In recent years, the CDC estimates, people 65 and older have represented 70% to 85% of seasonal-flu-related deaths and 50% to 70% of seasonal-flu-related hospitalizations. Aging immune systems also may not work as well in combination with standard-dose flu vaccines to protect you from severe infection, hospitalization, and death—which is why the CDC recommends the following specialized flu vaccines for those over 64. All 2024–25 vaccines are trivalent, meaning they protect against three influenza viruses. Fluzone High-Dose flu vaccine The Fluzone High-Dose vaccine, manufactured by Sanofi, contains four times the protection of standard-dose vaccines. Medicare Part B, most Medicare Advantage plans, and most private insurance plans cover Fluzone High-Dose, according to Sanofi. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the immunization only for people 65 and older. A randomized controlled trial published in 2014 in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that high-dose vaccines were 24% more effective than standard-dose vaccines in preventing flu among older adults. Don’t be alarmed if you experience more side effects than usual after receiving a high-dose shot, advises Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. “This vaccine has four times the amount of antigen—which is the active part of the vaccine—as the other vaccines,” she tells Fortune. “Since it has more antigen, it does produce a better immune response. It also means that there may be a little bit more in terms of local side effects, pain, low-grade fever, et cetera.” Fluad adjuvanted flu vaccine Fluad, manufactured by Seqirus, is the only other flu vaccine FDA-approved exclusively for people 65 and older. While a standard-dose vaccine, Fluad contains an adjuvant, an added ingredient that helps your body develop a stronger immune response. Fluad’s adjuvant is called MF59, an oil-in-water emulsion containing squalene, a substance naturally occurring in plants, humans, and animals. Medicare Part B and most Medicare Advantage plans cover Fluad without a co-pay, Seqirus says. While research has shown Fluad to better protect older adults from flu than standard-dose, unadjuvanted vaccines, the CDC says no randomized studies to date have compared the efficacy of high-dose and adjuvanted flu vaccines. Flublok recombinant flu vaccine Flu vaccine production has historically involved the replication of viruses inside chicken eggs—a process that takes time and requires large quantities of eggs. Since 2013, the U.S. has also begun manufacturing vaccines more quickly and synthetically via recombinant technology. Flublok, a vaccine manufactured by Sanofi and FDA-approved for adults 18 and older, is a recombinant flu vaccine. Flublok isn’t exclusive to older adults, but may offer them enhanced protection because it contains three times the antigen of standard-dose vaccines. Medicare considers Flublok among its preferred vaccines for people 65 and older. If Fluzone, Fluad, or Flublok aren’t available to you, the CDC says some protection is better than no protection and advises older adults to get a standard-dose vaccine.

GSK had been developing mRNA flu and COVID-19 shots with its partner CureVac, but earlier this year announced it had gained full control of those assets.GSK also sees potential for a combined shot. “We’re confident we have the capacity with this platform based on the efficacy and the side-effect profile, to ultimately develop a flu-COVID combination vaccine,” said Miels.Shares of GSK rose as much as 0.8% in early London trading, bringing the gain this year to about 15%.Vaccine developers including Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. are betting on an mRNA flu vaccine as a way to speed up the yearly development process that’s needed to adapt these vaccines to the circulating flu strain.“We saw this with COVID, the huge advantage of mRNA as a platform is it’s very flexible,” said Miels.That enables vaccine developers to significantly compress the timeframe from when they select a flu strain to when they ship their product. It also means that for the Northern Hemisphere, they have a longer period of time to see the strains develop in the Southern Hemisphere, he said.Miels said Moderna will likely be first to market in the mRNA flu vaccine race, but that the British drugmaker might be able to beat Pfizer in getting its shot approved. If the late-stage trial goes to plan, GSK hopes to file for approval for its shot in 2026, eyeing a rollout in 2027.“Reliability of supply is incredibly important and we have an excellent track record there as a company,” said Miels, pointing to other vaccines that GSK already manufactures.While the durability of mRNA shots has been called into question, this isn’t a problem for seasonal flu shots that need to be changed every year.

According to information from health officials, this person did not report exposure to animals, which is a first for tracking the virus in humans. In 2024, 14 people have been recorded with H5 bird flu cases, and those cases were linked to exposure to poultry or dairy cattle. “Nationally, this is the first case of H5 that has been detected as part of the flu surveillance system, rather than the targeted H5-outbreak specific surveillance that has been conducted as part of ongoing animal outbreaks which has identified all the other cases,” DHSS said in its statement. On Aug. 22, the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory was sent a specimen from a patient in the hospital. Information from health officials said the adult patient had underlying medical conditions and tested positive for influenza A. The patient recovered and was discharged.The agency explained transmission or risk of infection for the public remains low for H5 bird flu.DHSS added that no H5 infection in dairy cattle has been reported in Missouri, with only some H5 cases in commercial or backyard flocks and wild birds.The Missouri State Public Health Laboratory conducted additional testing to determine the influenza subtype as part of a typical influenza surveillance testing program. The testing resulted in a presumptive detection of the H5 subtype, with the specimen forwarded to the CDC for additional testing and confirmation.As DHSS continues to monitor the situation, it added that there’s “no sign of unusual influenza activity in people, including no increase in emergency room visits for influenza and no increase in laboratory detection of human influenza cases in Missouri.” USDA data from last week confirmed 197 cases of HPAI in dairy cattle since the outbreak began earlier this year, affecting herds in 14 states: Texas, Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Minnesota, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Dakota, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho and California.CDC recently published its findings about human HPAI cases in Colorado earlier in the summer.

TFF Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: TFFP) hat positive präklinische Daten für ihre bivalenten universellen Influenza-Impfstoffkandidaten bekannt gegeben, die mit der Thin Film Freezing (TFF)-Technologie hergestellt wurden. Die Studie, die in Zusammenarbeit mit Dr. Ted Ross von der Cleveland Clinic durchgeführt wurde, zeigte, dass die TFF- getrocknete Pulver-HA-Antigenimpfstoffkandidaten bei Frettchen neutralisierende Antikörpertiter gegen die H1- und H3-Influenza-Stämme induzierten, als sie intranasal verabreicht wurden.Die Forschung, die durch einen NIAID-Zuschuss in Höhe von 2,97 Millionen US-Dollar finanziert wird, zielt darauf ab, einen bei Raumtemperatur stabilen mukosalen universellen Influenza-Impfstoff zu entwickeln, der gegen mehrere Stämme wirksam sein und selbst verabreicht werden kann. Laufende Studien werden die Antikörpertiter gegen ein breiteres Spektrum von Influenza-A-Viren bewerten. Ziel des Unternehmens ist es, einen Impfstoffkandidaten bis zur IND und frühen klinischen Studien voranzubringen, mit dem Potenzial für signifikante Auswirkungen auf den Markt, sofern er erfolgreich ist. Positive TFF-dry powder HA antigen vaccine candidates showed positive results in ferret studies Vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers against H1 and H3 influenza strains Research funded by a $2.97 million NIAID grant Potential for a universal flu vaccine with billions in annual sales Negative None. Insights Medical Research Analyst positive The preclinical data for TFF Pharmaceuticals' universal influenza vaccine candidates show promising results. The TFF-dry powder HA antigen vaccines induced neutralizing antibody titers against H1 and H3 influenza strains in ferrets, a model closely resembling human immune responses. This is a significant step towards developing a broadly protective influenza vaccine.The use of intranasal delivery and mucosal adjuvants is noteworthy, as it could potentially enhance both cellular and antibody immune responses. This approach may lead to more effective protection against multiple influenza strains. The ongoing studies assessing neutralizing antibody titers against a panel of 13 influenza A viruses will provide important data on the vaccine's breadth of protection.If successful, this universal flu vaccine could revolutionize influenza prevention by offering protection against more than 75% of circulating strains, addressing the challenge of annual strain prediction and vaccine reformulation. Financial Analyst positive The positive preclinical data for TFF Pharmaceuticals' universal influenza vaccine candidates could significantly impact the company's future prospects. The global influenza vaccine market is substantial, with annual sales potential in the billions of dollars. If TFF's vaccine proves successful in clinical trials, it could capture a significant market share due to its broad protection and potential for self-administration.The $2.97 million SBIR grant from NIAID provides non-dilutive funding for further development, reducing financial risk for the company. However, investors should note that the path from preclinical success to market approval is long and uncertain. The company's ability to advance this program to IND and early clinical trials will be important for realizing its potential out-licensing opportunity, which could provide significant revenue through partnerships or royalties. 09/10/2024 - 07:00 AM TFF-dry powder HA antigen vaccine candidates induced neutralizing antibody titers in ferrets against H1 and H3 influenza strains Ongoing funded work to assess additional influenza strains FORT WORTH, Texas, Sept. 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Nasdaq: TFFP) (the “Company” or “TFF Pharmaceuticals”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative drug products based on its patented Thin Film Freezing (TFF) technology platform, announces positive preclinical data advancing a multivalent universal influenza vaccine manufactured by TFF to protect against seasonal and pandemic viruses. The data were produced in collaboration with Dr. Ted Ross, Global Director of Vaccine Development at Cleveland Clinic. “These preliminary data suggest that the intranasal administration of the TFF-dry powder hemagglutinin (HA) antigen vaccine candidates is highly immunogenic and produces protective antibody titers in ferrets,” said Dr. Harlan Weisman, TFF Pharmaceuticals Chief Executive Officer. “These data support continued development of a shelf-stable mucosal universal influenza vaccine that could be effective regardless of which strain emerges in any year and that could be self-administered.” The experiments conducted by Dr. Ross demonstrated that TFF-dry powder HA antigen vaccine candidates induce neutralizing antibody titers in ferrets against H1 and H3 influenza strains. No response was observed in animals vaccinated with mock vaccine. The ferret model is the gold standard to study host immune responses and evaluate influenza vaccine and antiviral therapies due to similarities with humans. Pre-immune female ferrets received TFF-dry powder HA antigen vaccine for intranasal (IN) delivery with various mucosal adjuvants that can elicit both cellular and antibody immune responses. Mock vaccine (adjuvant only) was used as a control. Serum was collected to assess neutralizing antibody titers against influenza A viruses for H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes. Ongoing studies will assess neutralizing antibody titers against a panel of 13 influenza A viruses isolated between 2006-2018 for H1N1 and 2012-2019 for H3N2 subtypes. After viral challenge, ferrets will be monitored daily for clinical signs and symptoms and antibody titers. These positive results will allow TFF to select an adjuvant for advanced development of a universal influenza vaccine candidate that will be delivered as a dry powder designed to protect against greater than 75% of the circulating influenza strains. This work is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, under a previously awarded Direct to Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant of approximately $2.97 million to continue development of a novel, pan-flu multivariant mucosal vaccine using the Company’s Thin Film Freezing technology. The goal of this program is to advance a vaccine candidate to IND and early clinical trials. If successful, a TFF-formulated universal flu vaccine has the potential to generate several billion dollars in annual sales, presenting a highly attractive out-licensing opportunity for the company. ABOUT TFF PHARMACEUTICALS’ THIN FILM FREEZING (TFF) TECHNOLOGY TFF Pharmaceuticals’ proprietary Thin Film Freezing (TFF) technology allows for the transformation of both existing compounds and new chemical entities into dry powder formulations exhibiting unique characteristics and benefits. The TFF process is a particle engineering process designed to generate dry powder particles with advantageous properties for inhalation, as well as parenteral, nasal, oral, topical and ocular routes of administration. The process can be used to engineer powders for direct delivery to the site of need, circumventing challenges of systemic administration and leading to improved bioavailability, faster onset of action, and improved safety and efficacy. The ability to deliver therapies directly to the target organ, such as the lung, allows TFF powders to be administered at lower doses compared to oral drugs, reducing unwanted toxicities and side effects. Laboratory data suggests the aerodynamic properties of the powders created by TFF can deliver as much as 75% of the dose to the deep lung. TFF does not introduce heat, shear stress, or other forces that can damage more complex therapeutic components, such as fragile biologics, and instead enables the reformulation of these materials into easily stored and temperature-stable dry powders, making therapeutics and vaccines more accessible for distribution worldwide. The advantages of TFF can be used to enhance traditional delivery or combined to enable next-generation pharmaceutical products. ABOUT TFF PHARMACEUTICALS TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaging patented rapid freezing technology to develop and transform medicines into potent dry powder formulations for better efficacy, safety, and stability. The company’s versatile TFF technology platform has broad applicability to convert most any drug, including vaccines, small and large molecules, and biologics, into an elegant dry powder highly advantageous for inhalation, or for topical delivery to the eyes, nose and the skin.

Doctors Weigh In on TimingIs It Too Early to Get a Flu Shot? Doctors Weigh In on TimingWe also spoke to experts about potential side effects (don't worry: they won't last long if you do get some).

The flu shot and pregnancy Side effectsCan I get a flu shot at the same time as my COVID-19 booster and/or an RSV vaccine?Where to get a flu shotYes, it's that time of year again — flu shot season! Even if you're a relatively healthy person, it's smart to get an influenza vaccine. "With the flu, you can never really know for sure who is going to get super-sick," says Kathryn A. Boling, MD, a primary care doctor at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that between 35 and 65 million Americans got the flu between October 1, 2023, and June 15, 2024 — which resulted in 16 to 30 million visits with a medical provider. But the flu shot can help prevent you from becoming a statistic, and having to deal with symptoms like headache, cough, fatigue, weakness, sore throat, runny, stuffy nose and eye pain. "It’s highly recommended that you receive a flu shot in order to prevent getting infected or transmitting the virus, and to reduce the severity of infection," says Paunel Vukasinov, MD, an internal medicine specialist at Medical Offices of Manhattan in New York City.It's true that you can still catch influenza even if you've been vaccinated against it, but your bout with the virus may be less severe than if you skip the vaccine: The flu vaccine typically lowers your chance of having to go to the doctor by 40 to 60%, according to the CDC. And while these numbers can fluctuate depending on which flu viruses are circulating, the seasonal shots are formulated to be as close to the projected current viruses as possible, so "the composition of the vaccine was updated in this year's shot to reflect the most likely circulating strains," explains Dr. Vukasinov. Related Stories11 COVID Symptoms to Look Out for Right NowWhat You Need to Know About the New COVID VaccineIf all of this sounds a bit overwhelming, don't worry. Read on to figure out the best time to get a flu shot, where to get one, what to expect after your vaccination and whether you should get all three vaccines to protect against the "tripledemic" (the flu, COVID and RSV) that experts say we can expect this cold and flu season.The best time to get a flu shotTiming your shot correctly is important because it takes a little time for your body to build up antibodies, and you want to be protected before the virus is rampant. "It takes up to two weeks after getting a flu shot to be fully protected," says Dr. Boling. "I’m telling my patients to get their flu shots during the month of October, so they are fully protected by November." You may be eager to get the jab done and over with, but it is possible to be vaccinated too early in the season. In 2022, "pharmacies had the shot available in July and August, and some of my patients who got their shots that early were coming to see me in April and May, sick with the flu, because their protection had worn off," Dr. Boling adds.Never get a flu shot while you're actively sick or have a fever, or if you know you've recently been around someone who was sick with the flu. "If you've been exposed to the flu and get your flu shot right afterward, there's a chance your symptoms may make you feel sicker, and in that instance, you should definitely be seen by your healthcare provider," says Dr. Boling. Once you feel better or a little time has passed since your exposure, then you can get jabbed.Flavio Coelho//Getty Images And if you're wondering if it's ever too late to get one, any time during cold and flu season technically works, but "usually sooner is better, in order for your body to have time and make a robust immune response," says Dr. Vukasinov. But even if you miss the October window, it's still worth getting a flu shot to protect you through the rest of winter. Who is most at risk for the flu? Certain factors can heighten your susceptibility to catching or getting a more severe case of the flu. “High risk groups include pregnant women, children younger than five years old (especially those under age two), adults age 50 and over (particularly past age 65) and individuals with chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, lung disease, kidney or liver disease and those with a compromised immune system,” says Dr. Vukasinov. The flu can become deadly if it leads to pneumonia or a brain infection called encephalitis, so while people shouldn't panic, those in high risk groups should be vigilant in getting jabbed against it, Dr. Boling adds.The flu shot and pregnancy Yes — the flu shot is safe for pregnant women in any trimester, and "it also protects your baby because women who get the flu vaccine while pregnant or breastfeeding can pass those antibodies that they develop to their babies," Dr. Vukasinov says. But there's one important note: pregnant women should confirm with their vaccinator that they're not receiving a vaccine with a live virus in it (LAIV or nasal spray).Related StoriesFifth Disease Is on the Rise — Here's What to KnowWhat You Need to Know About the Rise in DengueSide effectsSome people don't experience any side effects beyond a sore, red arm, says Dr. Vukasinov, but others may get flu-like symptoms such as headache, fatigue or fever. The good news is, most side effects will happen within 24 to 48 hours of getting vaccinated and go away on their own.However, if your symptoms get worse, give your doctor a call. The reason is twofold: You want to make sure you aren’t having a serious reaction to the shot (so, so rare, but still possible), and you also want to check to make sure you aren't having complications related to the flu itself if the virus managed to infiltrate you right before you got jabbed. Signs of a serious reaction to the flu vaccine include trouble breathing, hoarseness, paleness, dizziness and hives, but again, very few people experience these effects. Can I get a flu shot at the same time as my COVID-19 booster and/or an RSV vaccine?When it comes to the COVID booster, always ask your doctor first, but the answer will most likely be "yes." There's a possibility that you may have a higher chance of experiencing side effects if you double up — a 2022 CDC study found that people who got a flu vaccine and an mRNA COVID booster vaccine at the same time were slightly more likely (8% to 11%) to have reactions including fatigue, headache and muscle ache than people who only got a COVID mRNA booster vaccine. However, these reactions were usually mild and went away quickly, so that's not a reason to reject one or the other if your doctor signs off, says Dr. Vukasinov. If your doctor has recommended you get an RSV vaccine, too, you might want to split up these two jabs and get your flu shot at a different time. While it's safe to receive the two simultaneously, "there's some thought that co-administration of flu and RSV vaccines may make your antibodies somewhat lower, so I recommend spacing your flu shot and RSV shot out about two weeks apart," says Dr. Vukasinov.Where to get a flu shotMake an appointment with your healthcare provider, or head to your local pharmacy or urgent care clinic. Drug store chains like CVS and Walgreens offer low or no-cost flu shots with many insurance plans. Getting a shot is really easy – you can schedule an appointment online, or often just walk in.

Commentary | Opinion: California’s bird flu poses existential threat in nation’s largest dairy state With producers reluctant to test their sick cattle, state must mandate testing of milk storage tanks for the virusShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File) Many veterinarians believe the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza virus has been circulating in California dairies for months. By Crystal HeathUPDATED: November 7, 2024 at 1:37 PM PSTA correction to an earlier version of this commentary has been appended to the end.Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza was recently detected in three herds in the Central Valley. California is the nation’s largest dairy state, producing 20% of U.S. milk, so these infections pose a particular threat to both public health and food security in a country that has become heavily dependent on animal-based protein. This June, researchers detected H5 virus in San Francisco Bay Area wastewater. California was the only state with H5 wastewater detections, but no infected dairies have been reported — until now.Many veterinarians, like me, believe the virus has been circulating in California dairies for months. To stop the spread now, it’s time to take immediate action to increase disease surveillance through mandatory testing. We must also question our reliance on animal-based methods of protein production, which allow viruses of pandemic potential to flourish.Though the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has encouraged more widespread testing by offering to compensate producers for veterinary care and 90% of lost milk production, dairy producers are still reluctant to test sick cattle, fearing that government bailouts will not fully compensate them for their losses. One Colorado producer admitted to not notifying the state of illnesses, saying, “Sometimes it’s more convenient to not know.”Dairy producers have even fired their veterinarians over testing disputes. “It makes it really challenging to be that veterinarian and say, I know there’s flu on this farm, but the owner won’t approve testing,” Keith Poulsen, a veterinarian at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory told STAT, an online health journalism site. “That makes a pretty big ethical dilemma for veterinarians.”The virus has led to the mass extermination of 100 million commercially raised poultry birds across the United States since 2022. Globally, over 48 mammal and 485 bird species have been infected, including house mice and cats. In March, several cats died from drinking raw milk, but recently, two indoor-only cats with no known direct exposure to the virus also tested positive and died. Many more cases could be going unreported.Thirteen poultry and dairy workers have become infected with the virus, and researchers are worried that H5N1 reassortment with the seasonal flu virus could lead to the creation of a virus that is more easily transmitted between people, leading to a new human pandemic. Just last week, one person in Missouri tested positive for H5 with no known animal source. Could this signal the beginning of person-to-person spread?To get a better handle on the virus, Colorado implemented mandatory bulk milk tank testing statewide — uncovering 11 new positive herds. Unpublished research showed that bulk tank testing could uncover H5N1 infections 14-16 days before symptoms are noticeable. Our increasing dependence on animal-based protein production creates an ever-escalating infectious disease risk. Today, we consume nearly twice as much animal protein as we did a century ago. This growth is encouraged with the help of $38 billion dollars per year in government subsidies to the livestock industry. With the government granting $176 million to Moderna to develop an avian influenza vaccine, more than $1 billion allocated to address avian influenza in poultry flocks, more than $800 million given to compensate producers for the loss of their birds, and $200 million allotted to address avian influenza in dairy herds, this avian influenza outbreak will likely cost taxpayers billions when all’s said and done.Related Articles Commentary | Asymptomatic people may carry avian flu Commentary | Mask mandates are back at Bay Area health care facilities Commentary | Flu shot may not be as effective as last year, but it’s still worth getting Commentary | California’s bird-flu human cases rise to six, all linked to dairy farms Commentary | What’s next for avian flu? Genetic tests of California farmworkers could reveal viral evolution Instead of continuing to prop up harmful animal-based protein production with our tax dollars, we could be supporting businesses that increase access to nutritious, delicious and ubiquitous animal-free meals. Research has shown this redistribution of public funds could save $7.3 trillion globally in health burdens and ecosystem degradation. While testing and vaccines are needed to respond to this outbreak, we should make plans to move away from food production methods that escalate our arms race against nature.For now, we need to get a handle on the true extent of H5N1’s spread in our state. California must follow Colorado’s lead and immediately mandate bulk milk tank testing to protect animal and public health. Ignorance is bliss, but ignorance should not be our public health policy.Dr. Crystal Heath is a veterinarian and executive director of Our Honor, a nonprofit veterinary advocacy organization.

health concern globally, causing seasonal outbreaks that can strain healthcare systems and lead to increased hospitalizations and mortality. Each year, the flu virus undergoes changes, requiring vigilant monitoring to track its spread and evolution. In 2024, flu surveillance has continued to play a crucial role in guiding public health interventions and vaccine formulations, particularly in regions like South Africa, where influenza activity follows a predictable seasonal pattern. The following is a comprehensive report on flu surveillance in South Africa for 2024. In 2024, influenza activity in South Africa followed a typical seasonal pattern, beginning in April and peaking in early June. As expected during the winter months, influenza transmission levels reached moderate to high intensity. The flu season was dominated by the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strain, but a resurgence of influenza B was also detected in mid-July. Despite some genetic differences between circulating viruses and the Southern Hemisphere vaccine strain, the vaccine has remained effective. The World Health Organization’s National Influenza Centre (NIC), housed at the NICD’s Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis, monitored the flu season closely. This surveillance report, for weeks 1 through 33 of 2024, highlights the importance of continuous tracking and genetic analysis of influenza strains to ensure effective public health responses. This year’s flu season underscored the significance of vaccination and early detection. The continued surveillance by the NIC ensures that the country can adapt its flu vaccination strategies and maintain preparedness for future influenza outbreaks, helping to mitigate severe outcomes and protect vulnerable populations. With the potential for influenza to evolve and spread unpredictably, sustained monitoring and timely public health interventions remain critical. Highlights Epidemiology Influenza activity was observed from weeks 1 through 33, with an overall detection rate from 1 January through 18 August 2024 of 15.9% (887/5590). Using the Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) the levels of activity reached moderate and high levels in the ILI and Pneumonia Surveillance programmes, respectively. Influenza single infections where a subtype/lineage could be determined were dominated by A(H1N1)pdm09 (67.4%, 580/860) followed by B/Victoria (30.6%, 263/860). Low numbers of influenza A(H3N2) (1.9%, 17/860) were detected. Influenza B/Yamagata was not detected. Almost all of the South African 2024 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were subclade 6B.1A.5a.2a (5a.2a) (203/205, 99.0%), with two additional substitutions, T120A and K169Q, compared to the 2023 viruses. The 2024 Southern Hemisphere A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain (A/Victoria/4897/2022) is a subclade 5a.2a.1 virus, which differed to the subclade of the viruses circulating in South Africa in 2024. However, antigenic analysis of South African viruses showed that all (32/32, 100%) were well inhibited by subclade 5a.2a.1 vaccine-type antisera (A/Victoria/4897/2022 and A/Wisconsin/67/2022). Phenotypic neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility testing indicated that one (1/26, 3.8%) A(H1N1)pdm09 virus showed highly reduced inhibition to oseltamivir and paramivir, this virus was genotypically confirmed to contain the H275Y substitution in neuraminidase. Six influenza A(H3N2) viruses circulating in South Africa in 2024 were sequenced, and all (6/6, 100%) belonged to clade 3C.2a1b.2a.3a.1 (2a.3a.1) together with the 2024 Southern Hemisphere vaccine strain (A/Thailand/8/2022). None of the A(H3N2) viruses were found to be phenotypically (n=2) or genotypically (n=6) resistant to neuraminidase inhibiting antivirals.

Donate now Home Why you need a flu shot Health seekers Why you need a flu shot People with heart conditions and stroke face a higher risk of complications from influenza Sep 11, 2024 Share Facebook Twitter Email Print For those who have experienced heart conditions or stroke, or are at risk for these conditions, coming down with influenza (or flu) can increase the chances of having a heart attack or stroke. The good news? A flu shot can reduce hospitalizations, deaths and other flu-related complications such as heart attack and stroke. Having the flu can increase the risk of another stroke or heart attack. Dr. Alexandre Poppe is a Heart & Stroke researcher and a stroke neurologist in the division of neurology at the University of Montreal Health Centre. He spoke with Heart & Stroke about the importance of getting a flu shot this fall. What do you tell your patients about annual flu immunization? I recommend the flu shot to all my patients, especially older ones. Public health recommendations are that everyone over six months of age should get the flu vaccination. We know that those at highest risk of complications are people with chronic disease, including cardiovascular disease and stroke. Having the flu can increase the risk of another stroke or heart attack. Studies have shown that the risk of stroke or heart attack increases shortly after a flu infection, but probably even more in someone who is predisposed to stroke. Also, the flu can lead to hospitalization. So immunizing to reduce the risk of flu can in turn reduce the risk of in-hospital complications. With the ongoing pandemic and the need for COVID vaccine boosters, what should people know about getting a flu shot? COVID and the flu are two different illnesses; the COVID vaccine won’t protect you from the flu, and vice versa. So it’s important to get both vaccines. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization says there’s no real danger to having both vaccines very close, even during the same session. Plus, we all know that COVID has tested the healthcare system and strained its resources. Anything we can do to protect hospitals and clinics from being overloaded should be pursued. Vaccination is a relatively easy way to avoid hospital visits for respiratory illnesses and complications. If you’re sick with COVID, how long should you wait to get a flu shot? Health Canada guidelines state that people with acute symptoms of COVID-19 or any symptoms of acute respiratory infection, including a sore throat or runny nose, should postpone the flu shot until they have recovered. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that people over 65 should get a high-dose flu vaccine. What are your thoughts on that? Lower doses are recommended for younger people and children primarily because their immune systems are more robust. Older people’s immune systems can wane over time, and therefore a larger dose of vaccine can help ensure an immune response.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article NIAID Many questions remain unanswered in the case of the Missouri patient who contracted H5 bird flu without any known exposure to sick or infected animals. "It does raise the concern level, but there is a lot of information needed to understand how much it raises concern," said Amesh Adalja, MD, of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore. James Lawler, MD, MPH, of the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Global Center for Health Security in Omaha, echoed that experts have "very limited visibility into what's truly going on with the spread of H5," especially as surveillance of dairy herds has "quite honestly, been pathetic." The key concern is whether there has been human-to-human transmission, Lawler said: "That's certainly a concern when you have somebody who has no discernible exposure and who develops disease with H5." While that does not seem to be the case at this time, experts are wary about that next step in the trajectory of a virus that has already "ticked a lot of boxes" on its way to becoming a potential pandemic, including being able to infect new host species, Lawler said. Outside of human-to-human transmission, there could have been some "overlooked animal contact," Adalja told MedPage Today. While Missouri isn't currently reporting any infected cattle herds, "there are likely infected herds there, and in many other of the 36 states that have not officially reported cases," he said. There's also the possibility of exposure to infected birds, either wild or poultry flocks, or to any of the other wild or domestic animals that have been infected, including cats. Indeed, six domestic cats in Colorado were infected with H5N1, and only one was directly associated with a commercial dairy facility known to have sick animals, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health. Two of the cats were indoor-only and had no direct exposure to the virus. The patient may also have been exposed to unpasteurized milk, which has been shown to have very high levels of virus, Lawler said. He also raised the possibility of a failure of the milk pasteurization process. "There's a wide range of possibilities of where this person might have been infected," Lawler said. "The most concerning would be that the person caught it from another person, and that would indicate a step up in the virus' game." He cautioned that the CDC must first determine whether it's indeed H5N1, as the agency has only confirmed that it's an H5 virus. Sequencing would also be able to show whether it's from the clade that's currently circulating in dairy cows -- 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13. CDC said the case was picked up through the state's routine seasonal flu surveillance when the patient, who had other underlying medical conditions, was hospitalized on August 22. They were treated with flu antivirals, discharged, and made a full recovery. While this is the first U.S. case of H5 influenza without a known occupational exposure to sick or infected animals, and Missouri has not reported any infected cattle herds, it has reported H5N1-infected commercial and backyard poultry flocks this year, and infected wild birds in the past, CDC said. Lawler noted that the information about the case appeared to be withheld for several days: "It doesn't seem to be a good idea to withhold information that might indicate a significant development in the evolution of a very dangerous virus," he said. He noted that he is concerned that the virus continues to do things it hasn't done in the past. "Before this instance, I would have said we're [probably] not missing cases unassociated with exposure to dairy cows, birds, or milk products," he said. "Now, I'm not so sure."

A doctor explains why that is "very concerning." By Michael George, Sara Moniuszko Edited By Allison Elyse Gualtieri September 13, 2024 / 12:51 PM EDT / CBS News Survey: Many in U.S. skipping COVID vaccine Less than half of Americans plan to get COVID or flu vaccines this year, survey finds 01:30 As flu season approaches and COVID-19 cases continue across parts of United States, health experts are worried that many Americans are hesitant to get vaccinated.According to a new survey from Ohio State Wexner Medical Center, less than half of Americans are planning to get their COVID or flu shots this season.Dr. Nora Colburn, an infectious disease doctor with Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told CBS News these findings are "very concerning." "We really need a large majority of our population to get vaccinated, to protect our entire community," she said. The national poll of more than 1,000 people found more than a third — 37% — have gotten vaccines in the past but do not plan to this year. Colburn says getting vaccines is critical in protecting yourself and others. Updated COVID-19 shots and this year's flu shots are currently being rolled out. "It also protects you from complications of both infections," she said. "We know that people who get influenza and COVID can have increased risk of bacterial infections, as well as cardiovascular events, like heart attacks and strokes."The survey found adults 65 and older are the most likely to get the recommended vaccines."They're the most risk of getting severe disease. And we see that the vaccine really protects them from severe disease, hospitalization and even death," Colburn said. Others at high risk during respiratory virus season include people with certain chronic medical conditions and pregnant women.

Since October 2023, the Indiana Department of Health has logged 271 influenza-related deaths across the state. While the majority of those deaths (210) were listed as those 65 and older, young people were still counted among influenza-related deaths. Two were filed under ages 0-4, another two were documented for Hoosiers 5-24 and 13 were filed for Hoosiers 25-49 years old.Last year, IDOH listed another 274 influenza-related deaths between October 2022 and September 2023.Nationwide, according to National Center for Health Statistics mortality surveillance data, 10,211 have died from pneumonia and influenza this year. It marks a little more than .003% of deaths across the country this year.“Vaccines significantly decrease the number of hospitalizations and deaths caused by preventable diseases,” said Jennifer Sexton, nursing director for the Howard County Health Department. “When a large percentage of the population is vaccinated against a specific disease, it creates herd immunity, protecting those who cannot receive the vaccine due to health conditions or age.”The NCHS recently released early estimates for the nation’s immunization, based on data from the 2023 National Health Interview Survey. It estimated 48% of America’s adults have been vaccinated in the past 12 months.The organization also found in 2022 that 45.9% of American children 6 months to 17 years old had been vaccinated.IDOH breaks down immunization data differently. For example, data from the state department shows 20.8% of Hoosier children 6 months to 8 years old received an influenza vaccine during the 2022-23 season. However, data for children 1-2 years old shows 37.7% of Hoosier children received influenza vaccines during the same time period.13.4% of Hoosiers 9-18 years old received the influenza vaccination last flu season.From there, it jumps to 19-26 year olds, with 9.4% having been vaccinated for influenza as of June 30. That number climbs to 11.1% for 27-49 year olds, 22.3% for 50-64 year olds and 33.9% for 65-100 year olds.Who should get vaccinated for influenza?According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season.The CDC recommends people who need only one dose of the influenza vaccine to get theirs in September or October.For most adults, according to the CDC, getting vaccinated early could prove to be less effective because immunity decreases over time. However, the organization does recommend early vaccinations for children who need two doses or people in the third trimester of pregnancy during July and August, since the vaccine can help protect infants while they’re too young to be vaccinated.However, Sexton pointed out it’s best to get flu shots early into flu season, since it takes about two weeks for influenza vaccinations to kick in.The CDC lists three groups of people who should not get a flu shot: children younger than 6 months; people who are severely allergic to any ingredient in vaccines (which might include gelatin or antibiotics); and people who have had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of influenza vaccine (although the CDC recommends speaking to a health care provider to see whether vaccination could still be an option.)Depending on age and risk factors, Sexton noted, some people should also get vaccinated for RSV and pneumococcal disease.The RSV vaccine is recommended for people 75 and older, as well as people 60-74 years old with certain underlying health conditions, some pregnant women and children.New pneumococcal vaccines have been developed in recent years, Sexton added, and are recommended for older people, smokers and people with underlying health conditions. Sexton also recommended people 6 months and older get a seasonal COVID-19 vaccination.Vaccinations are available at local health department agencies, and pharmacies also provide some immunizations for people 11 and older. Some healthcare providers are able to give vaccines.Barriers to immunizationSexton explained local residents face several barriers to receiving vaccines.Some residents don’t have reliable transportation to get to clinics that offer immunization services. Others aren’t able to access the services during a clinic’s usual operation hours. Language can also be a barrier, Sexton explained, as well as misunderstanding about the cost of vaccines and the availability of programs for people who can’t afford them.The local Health Department has implemented a handful of strategies to reduce those barriers, Sexton explained.For example, the Health Department is open during extended hours throughout the week and is located on the City Trolley line, so people with transportation issues are still able to access immunization services.The department also offers off-site clinics at locations that could be more accessible to families. For example, the department works with every local school corporation to set up immunization clinics students can access at their schools. Some of the clinics are offered during school hours while others are set up after classes get out.To reduce language barrier issues, Sexton explained, the department uses an audio and visual language translation service for immunization visits in more than 40 languages. The service is also used for other services the Health Department offers, and is able to translate documents for the department’s clients.Finally, Sexton explained, the Health Department also offers vaccines to people regardless of health insurance coverage.“We do not want cost to be a barrier for anyone wanting to be vaccinated,” Sexton said.Fighting hesitancy with educationFor some Howard County unvaccinated residents, barriers to medical care isn’t the issue. It’s a hesitancy to believe in vaccines.After doubt spread over the COVID-19 vaccine in the early days of the pandemic, some people nationwide began to distrust vaccines in general. That includes Howard County residents, Sexton said.The Health Department noticed a decrease in immunization rates among infants, school-aged children and adults. However, Sexton said, there’s been a bit of a rebound in vaccinations recently.As of June 30, Howard County residents between the ages of 19-100 lagged behind statewide influenza vaccination rates. 19-26 year olds were closest to state vaccination rates with a 1.49 percentage point disparity, followed by 65-100 year olds with 1.93 points, 50-64 year olds with 2.56 points, then 27-49 year olds who lagged 3.86 percentage points behind statewide influenza immunization.Sexton explained the Howard County Health Department uses education and community outreach to combat the hesitancy to trust vaccinations.For example, she said, the local Health Department set up booths this year in places like the Howard County Fair, at the Haynes Apperson Festival and at the Kokomo Jackrabbits School Supply Giveaway.Still, Sexton said she would like to see more education in local high schools about how vaccines work, the history of their success and how the overall health of communities is impacted by immunization.She added the Howard County Health Department educates other community members, who are then able to spread the message about the importance of vaccines and the historical evidence that backs that message.“Polio vaccination is a perfect example,” Sexton said. “Without it we would still have iron lungs.” James Bennett III can be reached at 765-454-8580 or james.bennett@kokomotribune.com.

Following approval at the Executive Council (ExCo) on August 27, 2024, the scheme, designed to mitigate the impact of site closures due to HPAI-related restrictions, will remain in place until April 2, 2025. The tourism sector is vital to the Falkland Islands, and the government recognizes the importance of providing assistance to businesses, operators, and employees impacted by these restrictions. The scheme aims to compensate for financial losses incurred as a result of site closures and other legal restrictions implemented by the Falkland Islands Government (FIG) in response to the avian flu outbreak. Key Features of the Support Scheme The support scheme, managed by the Falkland Islands Tourist Board (FITB), includes several important features designed to fairly distribute compensation: Direct Link to Protection Zones: Compensation is only available for losses resulting from legal restrictions on specific sites due to HPAI-related closures. The scheme does not cover cancellations for locations or time periods where no protection zones were implemented. Pre-Booked Services Only: Compensation is provided for actual losses, not potential losses. This principle ensures that businesses with existing bookings are prioritized, as they are more likely to incur losses from site closures compared to those without guaranteed bookings. 50% Compensation for Unrecoverable Losses: The scheme covers 50% of losses that cannot be recovered through other means, such as alternative tours or cancellation policies. Businesses must certify that they have exhausted other recovery options before applying for compensation. Compensation for Operators and Site Managers: Payments will be made to the individual or business that typically handles bookings and accepts payments. If an agent or operator employs other service providers (e.g., drivers or lodge staff), they must certify that compensation will be passed on to impacted employees at 50% of their expected earnings. In cases where the loss includes entry or landing fees, FITB will withhold 50% of the expected fee for site operators, who can then apply for compensation based on the original bookings. Auditable by FIG: To ensure compliance with the scheme’s terms and conditions, the Falkland Islands Government reserves the right to audit applications. Government’s Commitment to Supporting Tourism MLA Gavin Short, Portfolio Holder for Economic Development, expressed his gratitude to all involved in extending the support scheme. He noted the significant impact avian influenza had on businesses last season and emphasized the importance of the government standing by to assist if the outbreak affects the tourism sector again this year. “We are heading into unknown territory regarding whether avian flu will impact us this season, but we must continue to plan for the worst while hoping for the best,” Short stated. “The government remains vigilant and prepared to take action as necessary.” Looking Ahead While the situation remains uncertain, the Falkland Islands Government is taking proactive steps to ensure the tourism sector remains resilient in the face of potential disruptions caused by avian influenza. Guidance on eligibility criteria for the compensation scheme will be made available soon, offering clarity for businesses looking to apply for assistance.

Vaxxas initiates Phase 1 clinical trial of pre-pandemic Avian Influenza A Virus vaccine September 12, 2024 Latest News Vaxxas has initiated a multi-centre Phase 1 clinical trial of a vaccine against pre-pandemic avian influenza strain H7N9, using its high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP). Vaxxas leads the multi-centre trial with oversight by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the US Department of Health and Human Services. It is designed to expand foundational novel countermeasure capabilities in response to potential future pandemic threats to public health. Vaxxas’ HD-MAP platform delivers vaccines by briefly applying a small patch to the skin, potentially minimising the costs and complexities of traditional vaccination delivery. The HD-MAP aims to deliver vaccine directly to the dense populations of skin-resident immune cells, enhancing immune responses with potential dose-sparing benefits. The HD-MAP has been shown in early studies to be easy to use, with the potential for vaccines to be stable at room temperature, avoiding or minimising the need for cold-chain refrigeration and facilitating distribution of vaccine patches by mail and courier for potential self-administration. The clinical study includes 258 healthy participants between the ages of 18 and 50, making it Vaxxas's largest Phase 1 trial conducted with its HD-MAP technology to date. The trial will compare the safety and immune response of participants to the pre-pandemic avian influenza strain H7N9 when dosed with Vaxxas’ novel HD-MAP as well as through conventional needle and syringe. Initial results from the trial are expected in 2025. Vaxxas and its clinical collaborators will provide BARDA with the trial's initial results and publish them. "Global pandemic threats require the world’s health organisations to have better and more accessible vaccine delivery options. With potential benefits such as thermostability, ease of use, and patient acceptability, Vaxxas’ HD-MAP is designed to be rapidly and broadly deployed to accelerate vaccination uptake and rates,” said David Hoey, CEO of Vaxxas. The influenza A virus circulates as numerous strains across the globe. The World Health Organization states the H7N9 avian influenza strain is “of concern” as most patients become severely. This Australian-based Phase 1 clinical study is being conducted at three of the University of the Sunshine Coast’s clinical trial centres in Queensland and the Doherty Clinical Trial centre in Melbourne, Victoria.

Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save In fall of 1918, the University of Montana shut its doors after dozens of Student Army Training Corps members collapsed from illness during routine drills. Hotels converted into hospitals. Most were sick or caring for the sick. It was influenza, or Spanish flu, a disease that turned the skin blue and killed more Americans than World Wars I and II combined. Glimpses of the 1918 influenza are hard to come by, despite the severe impact of millions succumbing to the virus across the world. In Montana, 5,000 people died within a few months; it was the fourth-worst-hit state. "Blue Death: the 1918 influenza in Montana" reveals the local stories of Montanans from the Spanish Flu. The documentary was created by UM professors Public Broadcasting Corporation The lack of historical storytelling of the deadly time period led UM historians and researchers to create a documentary titled "Blue Death: The 1918 Influenza in Montana."

Film Director Dee Garceau said the documentary hopes to rediscover those historical accounts from the Spanish flu, as people during that time seldom discussed the topic because of the negativity and loss surrounding it. "If we think of history, especially history of the American West or of Montana, as our collective memory, there is a big piece of amnesia regarding the 1918 flu," Garceau said at the Missoula premiere on Tuesday. "This was a very traumatic experience, so people tended not to write about it in their letters and diaries. They tended not to hand down family stories about it." UM history professor Leif Fredrickson said severe loss made people want to hide or suppress the dark details of death and destruction. Nonetheless, UM researchers and other historians across the state traced firsthand accounts through decedents, newspaper clippings, letters and diaries to reconstruct the stories. The documentary shows the pandemic through the lenses of children, married couples, tribal leaders, Black women and young men, many of whom traveled to Montana for new life opportunities. A young boy fights for survival at a hotel in Forsyth. Families are divided and eventually reunited by the illness. And a group of tribal leaders race to stop another disease outbreak within their community. Some of the same themes from the COVID-19 pandemic were present in 1918. People wore masks to protect themselves, businesses were forced to close, and some residents resisted the restrictions. But, unlike COVID, which put older adults especially at risk, the flu outbreak was most damaging for people ages 18 to 40. When the virus infected healthy people, their immune systems overcompensated to fight the disease, causing secondary issues like pneumonia and heart complications.Unlike modern times, there was no vaccine to slow the virus. Jabour said other aspects of history collided with influenza during this time, including the suffrage movement and increased social services from the government in the early 20th century. "Programs were really being pioneered, mostly at the local and state level, in the 1910s, although many of those experiments were derailed by the influenza of 1918 as well as the U.S. entry into World War I," Jabour said. Fredrickson said most U.S. history textbooks seldom mentioned the 1918 influenza during the Progressive Era. He said part of the reason for the documentary was to shed light on that lost history. After the COVID-19 pandemic, more textbooks now show the history of the Spanish flu, Fredrickson said. He said it is good to compare both of the pandemics to better understand the world's response."But, there is still a lot to be done in terms of remembrance and reckoning with this incident," Fredrickson said. "It needs more than just familiarity in people's mind ... it needs a real deep dive (into) what these experiences were like for people, and people in different localities that experienced it differently." The documentary is free to watch and available on the Public Broadcasting Corporation at pbs.org/show/blue-death/.Jabour and Fredrickson, Blackfeet historians Leon Rattler and Cheryle Cobell Zwang, Crow historian Reno Charette, Stillwater County historian Penny Redli and Forsyth oral historian Gordon Dean provided contextual remarks on camera within the film. Garceau, Associate Producer Ashby Glover, University of Minnesota Professor Lori Ann Lahlum, and film interns Kym MacEwan, Ginger Duncan, Kevin Mobley and Chad Keller conducted the research for the documentary. The documentary has been available online since the start of the summer, and received awards from the WildSound Film Festival in Toronto, the Documentary Feedback Film Festival in Los Angeles and the Chicago Indie Film Festival. The film will be shown at the Montreal Independent Film Festival this month. Griffen Smith is the local government reporter for the Missoulian. 0 Comments You must be logged in to react.

South Atlantic News Agency MercoPress, en Español Montevideo, November 12th 2024 - 06:50 UTC Falklands orders four new Britten-Norman 2B-26 Islander aircraft Food insecurity feared in Bolivia after weeks-long road blockades France lobbying among EU partners to veto trade agreement with Mercosur Falklands support for tourism sector affected by pathogenic avian influenza Monday, September 9th 2024 - 10:14 UTC Full article Given the importance of the tourist sector, the Falklands Government, where possible, will compensate for losses associated with HPAI-related restrictions Following the approval at ExCo on Tuesday 27 August 2024, the Falkland Islands Government are pleased to announce the continuation of the support scheme designed specifically to mitigate the effects of site closures associated with the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), also known as bird flu, on tourism businesses, operators and employees until 2 April 2025. Tourism is an important sector for the Falkland Islands, and the Government is keen to ensure that, where possible, affected tourism-related businesses can be compensated for losses associated with HPAI-related restrictions implemented by FIG in response to HPAI. The scheme will be administered by the Falkland Islands Tourist Board on behalf of the Government. Key features of the scheme are: • Linked directly to protection zones or other restrictions implemented by FIG. The scheme seeks to compensate applicants who incur a loss as a direct result of legal restrictions imposed on access to a specific site for a specific period of time. The scheme will not compensate for cancellations for locations or time periods for which no protection zone has been implemented. • Available for pre-booked services. The scheme will compensate for actual rather than potential loss. This is based on the principle that an individual or business without an existing booking was 1) not guaranteed income on the specified day and 2) had more flexibility to pursue alternative activities than an individual or business that had an existing booking. • Payable at 50% of unrecoverable loss. Recognizing that some operators will have cancellation policies or will be able to undertake alternative activities (e.g., a tour to an unaffected site), applicants will be required to certify that they have not been able to recover some or all of the loss incurred. The scheme will compensate at a rate of 50% of the unrecoverable loss. • Payable to the individual/business typically accepting payment or to the site operator/manager who would accept entry/landing fees. Where an agent or operator employs others in delivery of a service (e.g., tour drivers, lodge staff), the agent or operator will be responsible for making the application. The applicant must certify that they will compensate impacted employees or service providers at a rate commensurate with the compensation provided (i.e., 50% of what those employees/service providers would have received). The exception will be for losses that include payment of entry or landing fees. In those instances, the applicant must provide information about the amount of entry/landing fee that would typically be paid. Based on this, Falkland Islands Tourist Board (FITB) will withhold an amount equal to 50% of the expected entry/landing fee. The site operator will be eligible to apply for compensation and this amount will be paid directly to the site operator. In situations where the agent is able to rebook visitors on another tour, the site operator associated with the original booking can still apply for compensation, based on evidence of bookings that had been made. • Auditable by FIG. FIG reserves the right to audit applications to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions. Portfolio Holder for Economic Development, MLA Gavin Short said: “I would like to thank everyone who worked on this project and to Colleagues for agreeing to extend the scheme to this tourist season. We saw what could happen last season with the avian flu and the effect it could have on businesses and the people who operate them and it is only right that we as a Government stand ready to assist should avian flu have an impact this season. Once again, we are heading into something of an unknown situation as to whether we shall see instances of avian influenza and if so, what its impact may be but we must continue to plan for the worst and hope for the best and remain vigilant and be ready to act.” Guidance on the eligibility criteria will be available in due course on: https://www.falklandislands.com/avian-influenza Categories: Agriculture, Health & Science, Tourism, Falkland Islands.

Mice fed raw milk infected with bird flu experienced high levels of virus in their lungs, according to a study published May 24, 2024 that underscores the danger to humans of consuming the drink. Over the past few years, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus called HPAI H5N1 has spread to infect more than 50 animal species, including dairy cattle in the United States from March. (AFP/CDC and NIAID) A person in the state of Missouri has become the first in the United States to test positive for bird flu without a known exposure to infected animals, authorities said on Friday. The adult patient, who has underlying conditions, was admitted to hospital on Aug. 22, received antiviral medications against influenza, then recovered and was discharged, according to statements from the Centers for Control and Disease Prevention (CDC) and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. As the patient's flu type appeared suspicious on an initial test, it was sent for additional testing in state and federal laboratories, which revealed it was H5, also known as avian flu or bird flu. The CDC said it had not identified any transmission to the patient's close contacts or any other person. Scientists have voiced concern about the growing number of mammals becoming infected by bird flu, even if cases in humans remain rare. They fear a high rate of transmission could facilitate a mutation of the virus, which could enable it to be passed from one human to another. Contacted by AFP, the World Health Organization said on Saturday it was "encouraging that the national disease surveillance system has identified this case, that the patient received antiviral treatment, and that no further cases have been detected among close contacts". "It is critical that investigations into the patient's exposure are continued, as indicated by national and state authorities, to inform further prevention and response activities," said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's director of epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention. "WHO strongly supports US efforts for surveillance of zoonotic influenza across human, environmental and animal sectors," Van Kerkhove continued. "It is important to understand the circulation of avian influenza in poultry, wild birds and other animals in the state," she said of Missouri. "Stronger disease surveillance in animals is essential to protect animal and human health." No animal contact The person who tested positive for bird flu was the 14th to do so in the US this year, and the first without known contact with animals. Indeed, "no H5 infection in dairy cattle has been reported in Missouri," said the Missouri health department, though "some H5 cases in commercial or backyard flocks and wild birds have been reported." All previous bird flu cases in the United States have been among farmworkers, including the very first, in 2022. Bird flu is most commonly found in wild birds and poultry, but has more recently been detected in mammals, with an outbreak in cattle seen across the country this year. It can occasionally infect humans through close contact or contaminated environments. While the CDC continues to assess the risk to the public as low, "circumstances may change quickly as more information is learned", it said. In the decades since H5 has been found in humans, there have been rare cases where an animal source cannot be identified. But there has so far not been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, which would significantly increase the threat level.

Drawing together technical veterinary knowledge from across the pig industry, Zoetis is helping to share the latest knowledge by hosting an annual two-day CPD event for younger pig vets, particularly those new to the industry. The focus during the last event was on swine influenza, porcine circovirus (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), the ‘big three’ viruses commonly affecting pigs. Here, Adrian Cox of Farmvet, Susanna Williamson of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and Laura Hancox from Zoetis take a closer look at swine influenza. See also: Boosting pig farming efficiency through precision technology Effects and transmission Swine influenza virus is a challenge for some pig herds, with an ongoing risk of introduction to a herd. “Historically, a flu infection would last three to seven days in each animal and an outbreak would have worked its way through a pig population in a couple of weeks. However, flu is now more endemic in pig herds,” Dr Cox explained. “It is spread mainly via aerosol or nose-to-nose contact, as well as through equipment or clothing and, in outdoor herds, there can be repeated contamination via lungworm larvae, in which the virus can survive.” Swine influenza virus likes cool temperatures and low light and also survives well in water. However, it is easily killed by handwashing, detergents and disinfectants. APHA’s Dr Williamson added: “Clinical signs due to swine influenza are very variable, from sub-clinical and unnoticed to signs of respiratory disease including fever, lethargy, reduction in appetite, sneezing, nasal discharges, coughing and reddening of eyes. Vaccination can be an important part of prevention and control © Zoetis “Severe cases can show respiratory distress due to pneumonia and pigs affected in this way may die, although this is usually due to secondary infections and is not common in uncomplicated swine influenza in pigs. Producers can be unaware that a breeding herd is infected until clinical signs appear in weaned pigs.” If reproductive failure occurs during a swine influenza outbreak, it is most often in pigs in late pregnancy or at farrowing and reflects the effects of disease due to swine influenza on the sows (such as fever, lethargy, inappetence and respiratory disease) rather than a direct effect of the virus on placenta or foetuses. Swine influenza can act as a stressor like environmental and other challenges and could adversely affect intake of nutrients or inclusions – Regumate, for example – at critical times, which could affect fertility. Vaccination of gilts prior to arrival, or during their isolation period before entering a herd with endemic swine influenza, can be appropriate to prevent respiratory disease and disruption to their appetite and health around the time of service and conception. Evolution of swine influenza strains Influenza is an enveloped RNA virus, making it more prone to mutation, and there can also be development of reassortants, Dr Hancox explained. “Flu virus genomes are made up of distinct segments and are prone to reassort or ‘swap’ RNA segments if animals are infected with two different flu viruses, meaning progeny viruses can take segments of RNA from each parent virus,” she said. There are three main influenza strains circulating in pigs in Europe: H1N2, H1N1 and H3N2. APHA surveillance data shows the swine influenza strains currently identified in UK pigs are H1N2, pandemic H1N1 2009 (pdmH1N109) and avian-like H1N1 and their reassortants. H3N2 has not been detected since 1997. Pigs also have receptors to avian and human strains of flu. Some human strains can infect pigs and vice versa. To help minimise risk, some pig farming businesses offer seasonal human flu vaccinations to staff. Diagnosis To diagnose swine influenza, plain nasal swabs or respiratory tissues from recently affected pigs in a group are tested by PCR. This testing is provided free of charge at APHA for UK pigs. “There is a short window of opportunity to detect swine influenza virus as there is significant excretion for only five to seven days in an individual pig,” Dr Williamson explained. “Vets should aim to go and collect swabs as soon as possible after the first clinical signs are noticed and sample the most recently affected pigs.” When swine influenza is detected, further testing identifies the strain involved, which helps in decisions about control and vaccination and identifying possible sources of infection. Management When disease becomes endemic, achieving stability is the priority, using preventative measures to keep it to a level where health, welfare and performance can be maintained. Management to prevent or control swine influenza infections depends on the individual farm and is likely to include a combination of careful pig sourcing, biosecurity, ensuring ideal environmental conditions, management of pig flow and vaccination. Good biosecurity practices, carried out consistently, are key to prevent swine influenza – and other diseases – entering the farm or becoming part of a cycle of reinfection. People, pigs, equipment and vehicles all need to be considered. People who have flu-like symptoms should avoid contact with pigs, including staff, vets and any other visitors. Farm vets should check the health status of any bought-in pigs before moving them to the unit and pigs should have a period of isolation before being introduced to the herd. A mass vaccination to help control an outbreak of swine influenza may be required. It is important to test to find out which particular strain is affecting a herd before vets decide if vaccination is appropriate or which vaccine to use. Regular sampling might be useful to monitor presence of flu and check for any new strains. “Vaccination to protect pigs against swine influenza has increased over the past few years, mainly breeding herd vaccination to help stabilise immunity in the piglets and reduce disease in weaners,” said Dr Williamson. Co-infection with PRRS An influenza outbreak can be particularly severe if PRRS is also present, due to the synergism between the two viral infections. A co-infection with PRRS (also known as ‘blue ear’) and influenza is colloquially termed ‘blue flu’. Blue ears are still a sign of PRRS, but producers should take care with diagnosis as APP, salmonella and other systemic infections can also cause blue ears. “PRRS targets immune cells, causing a massive, non-controlled inflammatory response, so its clinical signs can appear similar to flu,” Dr Cox said. “There is less seasonality with ‘blue flu’ than in the past, but it is still skewed towards autumn and winter. The most likely combination is PRRS and the H1N1 pandemic strain and its immunosuppressive nature brings an increased risk of secondary bacterial infection.” Management strategies in the face of co-infection with PRRS and influenza can include a mass vaccination against both infections, and strategic medication for any secondary bacterial infections. A continued regular mass vaccination programme may also be recommended, an example being PRRS and influenza vaccines given alternately every six weeks so each vaccine is given four times a year. A regular review of external and internal biosecurity measures, ensuring all staff understand them and carry them out consistently, is vital. Partial depopulation could be appropriate depending on the specific situation, or a management change to break the reinfection cycle – for example, stopping gilts being brought in or not keeping any weaners on site.

According to the Department of Disease Control (DCC), flu cases QTD are up 230% compared to the same period in 2023. The patient mix remains concentrated in children under 15 years old. Tisco Securities expects the elevated number of flu cases to support OPD and IPD traffic in 3Q24 for all of our healthcare players. Regarding the floods in Chiang Rai province, BDMS, BCH and RAM are still able to operate hospitals in the region though they have seen some impact on traffic. Nonetheless, impact should be minimal as they only have 1 site each in Chiang Rai vs. their total networks of 58, 16 and 19 hospitals, respectively. Top picks among healthcare stocks for Tisco Securities are Bumrungrad Hospital Public Company Limited (SET: BH) for its solid 2H24 margin trend and Praram 9 Hospital Public Company Limited (SET: PR9) for its Thai/Non-Thai patient revenue growth and attractive valuation. The elevated number of flu cases currently seen should have a positive impact on Thai healthcare providers, increasing both outpatient visits (OPD) and inpatient admissions (IPD). Hospitals with a significant focus on domestic patients, particularly those that have a greater cash patient mix, such as PR9, THG, and EKH, should have more pronounced topline benefits compared to hospitals with Social Security (SSO) patients (BCH, CHG, and RAM). The flooding in Mai Sai, a town on the Thailand-Myanmar border in Chiang Rai province, since 9 September should have limited impact on topline growth due to the geographic diversification of the networks of affected hospital stocks (BDMS, BCH and RAM). Furthermore, Tisco Securities expects the flooding to be short-lived and note that some areas are already seeing water levels retreat. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Seree Supharatid, director of the Climate Change and Disaster Center of Rangsit University, expects it to take around a week for the waters to recede, assuming no more major storms during the period. Tisco Securities also highlight that seasonality impact should outweigh the softer traffic at affected sites.

In their paper published in Nature Communications, the group describes how they tested multiple birds for the virus in the region over the years 2022–23 and what they learned by doing so. The H5N1 avian influenza virus, as its name suggests, infects mainly birds, though it has been found to infect a few mammals, including humans. It was first observed in 1959 and then again in 1997. Early outbreaks were stopped by mass killing of animals in the infected areas. More recently, infections have become widespread, infecting birds, both wild and domestic, across the globe. Billions of birds have been killed, thus far, and there is no indication that the pandemic is slowing. In this new effort, the researchers have found that the virus has even made its way to birds living in Antarctica—one place on the planet that is generally safe from such outbreaks. The researchers travelled to several sub-Antarctic and Antarctic sites and tested birds that were living there, finding infected birds in all the places they visited. They also noted that the virus was infecting multiple species, ranging from Antarctic terns, to South Georgia shags, to brown skuas. They also found the virus had infected several marine mammals, such as the southern elephant seal. In conducting a genetic analysis of the viruses they found, the research team was able to determine that the virus had spread to the sub-Antarctic (likely via migratory birds) from South America, and from there to Antarctica. The team also tested two penguins, one a king and the other a southern rockhopper, and found no evidence of infection. The research team concludes by noting that it is not yet known what sort of impact the virus is having on bird populations in Antarctica, but that their work highlights the need for more research in the region. 10 September 2024 Share this story Tweet Latest photos Register free to upload Latest articles Research reveals how stormy conditions affect albatrosses' ability to feed Although able to use the wind to travel hundreds of thousands of miles, research now reveals there is an upper limit to the wind's benefit to albatrosses.
