Influenza and COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months, including health care personnel (HCP). What is added by this report? HCP influenza vaccination coverage was 79.9% during the 2021–22 season; 87.3% completed primary COVID-19 vaccination, 67.1% of whom received a COVID-19 booster dose. Influenza, primary COVID-19, and COVID-19 booster coverage was higher among HCP who reported employer vaccination requirements for those vaccines; coverage was lowest among HCP working in long-term care settings. What are the implications for public health practice? Enhanced efforts are needed to improve HCP vaccination coverage, especially with COVID-19 booster doses and annually for influenza vaccines. Staying up to date with COVID-19 and influenza vaccines can protect HCP and their patients.

ACIP also recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months, including HCP, be vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines and remain up to date (2,3). During March 29–April 19, 2022, CDC conducted an opt-in Internet panel survey of 3,618 U.S. HCP to estimate influenza vaccination coverage during the 2021–22 influenza season as well as receipt of the primary COVID-19 vaccination series and a booster dose. Influenza vaccination coverage was 79.9% during the 2021–22 season, and 87.3% of HCP reported having completed the primary COVID-19 vaccination series; among these HCP, 67.1% reported receiving a COVID-19 booster dose. Among HCP, influenza, COVID-19 primary series, and COVID-19 booster dose vaccination coverage were lowest among assistants and aides, those working in long-term care (LTC) or home health care settings, and those whose employer neither required nor recommended the vaccines. Overall, employer requirements for influenza and COVID-19 primary series vaccines were reported by 43.9% and 59.9% of HCP, respectively; among HCP who completed the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines, 23.5% reported employer requirements for COVID-19 booster vaccines. Vaccination coverage for all three vaccine measures was higher among HCP who reported employer vaccination requirements and ranged from 95.8% to 97.3% for influenza, 90.2% to 95.1% for COVID-19 primary series, and 76.4% to 87.8% for COVID-19 booster vaccinations among HCP who completed the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines, by work setting. Implementing workplace strategies demonstrated to improve vaccination coverage among HCP, including vaccination requirements or active promotion of vaccination, can increase influenza and COVID-19 vaccination coverage among HCP and reduce influenza and COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality among HCP and their patients (4). An Internet panel survey of HCP was conducted during March 29–April 19, 2022, to provide estimates of influenza and COVID-19 vaccination coverage among HCP during the 2021–22 influenza season. Similar surveys have been conducted annually since the 2010–11 influenza season, and previously published results from the 2020–21 season are available (5). Respondents were recruited from two preexisting national opt-in Internet sources: Medscape,* a medical website managed by WebMD Health Professional Network, and general population Internet panels operated by Dynata.† Responses were weighted to the distribution of the U.S. population of HCP§ by occupation,¶ age, sex, race and ethnicity, work setting, and U.S. Census Bureau region. A poststratification weight for each survey respondent was calculated by fitting a generalized exponential model and estimating the model parameters using calibration equations (6). Among 3,830 eligible participants, a total of 3,679 completed the survey (completion rate = 96.1%**). Sixty-one participants were excluded because they did not report their occupational setting or indicated a setting other than those listed, and the verbatim description did not qualify as a health care setting, leaving 3,618 respondents in the analytic sample. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†† Estimated (weighted) proportions and corresponding 95% CIs for three vaccination measures (influenza vaccination coverage for the 2021–22 season, COVID-19 vaccination coverage [i.e., receipt of ≥1 dose and completion of primary series§§], and COVID-19 booster vaccination¶¶) were estimated for each work setting, occupation, and demographic characteristic. LTC settings include nursing homes, assisted living facilities, other long-term care facilities, home health agencies, and home health care. Employer requirements for all three vaccination measures were assessed through three separate questions.*** The Korn-Graubard method was used to calculate CIs for proportions, assuming that the weighted estimates were approximately unbiased.††† CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics reliability criteria for proportions were applied to the estimates in the descriptive analyses of HCP characteristics (7). T-tests were used to assess differences among subgroups; p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0.1; RTI International) were used to conduct all analyses. Overall, 79.9% of HCP reported having received an influenza vaccination during the 2021–22 season, not significantly different from the 75.9% reported during the 2020–21 season (Table 1). During the 2021–22 season, higher influenza vaccination coverage was reported among HCP with either a master’s, professional, or doctoral degree (92.3%) and an associate or bachelor’s degree (80.2%) than among those with some college education or less (66.7%). Influenza vaccination coverage was lower among nurse practitioners and physician assistants (92.4%), nurses (87.8%), other clinical personnel (87.8%), nonclinical HCP (75.7%), and assistants and aides (68.8%) compared with coverage among physicians (96.8%). Influenza vaccination coverage during 2021–22 was highest among HCP working in hospitals (92.0%) and lowest among HCP working in LTC settings (66.4%). Coverage was higher among HCP who reported an employer requirement for influenza vaccination (96.8%) than among those who reported an employer recommendation (76.5%) or no recommendation or requirement for vaccination (48.1%). Compared with the 2020–21 influenza season, increases in influenza vaccination coverage were observed among HCP aged 30–45 years (7.5 percentage points), those with more than a college degree (10.9 percentage points), physicians (5.5 percentage points), and pharmacists (4.3 percentage points). Overall, 89.9% of HCP reported having received ≥1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 87.3% reported having completed the primary COVID-19 vaccination series (Table 2). Among those who completed the primary series, 67.1% reported having received a COVID-19 booster vaccine dose. Completion of primary COVID-19 vaccination was higher among HCP with more than a college degree (97.0%), those with an associate or bachelor’s degree (87.3%), physicians (98.7%), those who received an influenza vaccination during the 2020–21 influenza season (94.1%), and those working in hospitals (91.6%), nonrural areas (88.6%), and facilities where their employer required COVID-19 vaccination (93.1%) compared with the respective reference groups. Similar patterns were observed for receipt of a COVID-19 booster vaccine dose, with the addition of higher coverage among HCP aged 45–59 years (71.7%) and ≥60 years (87.0%), and lower coverage among female HCP (64.7%) and those working in the U.S. Census Bureau South Region (59.8%). Employer requirements for receipt of influenza and COVID-19 primary series vaccination were reported by 43.9% and 59.9% of HCP, respectively (Figure). Overall, among HCP who completed the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines, 23.5% reported employer requirement for COVID-19 booster vaccination. HCP working in LTC settings were less likely to report requirements for receipt of any vaccine compared with HCP working in hospitals and ambulatory care settings. Coverage with influenza vaccine, the primary COVID-19 series, and a COVID-19 booster dose was higher among HCP who reported an employer requirement for vaccination than among those who reported an employer recommendation or neither a recommendation nor requirement for vaccination. Among HCP who reported employer vaccination requirements, influenza vaccination coverage ranged from 95.8% to 97.3%, COVID-19 primary series vaccination coverage ranged from 90.2% to 95.1%, and COVID-19 booster vaccination coverage among HCP who completed the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines ranged from 76.4% to 87.8%, by work setting. Among HCP who reported that their employer neither recommended nor required vaccinations, influenza vaccination coverage ranged from 40.1% to 64.2%, COVID-19 primary series vaccination coverage ranged from 54.4% to 62.8%, and among HCP who completed the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines, COVID-19 booster vaccination coverage ranged from 46.1% to 59.7%, by work setting. Top Discussion Overall influenza vaccination coverage among HCP during the 2021–22 season was similar to that during the previous season. As observed during previous influenza seasons, nonclinical personnel, assistants and aides, HCP working in LTC settings, HCP with less than a college degree, and HCP who reported their employer neither required nor recommended the influenza vaccine had the lowest vaccination coverage (5). Similar patterns were observed for COVID-19 vaccination coverage, although coverage with the primary COVID-19 vaccination series was ≥80% in all work settings, including LTC settings, possibly, in part, because of the prioritization of HCP when the U.S. vaccination program commenced in December 2020 and a relatively high prevalence of employers required COVID-19 vaccination among HCP. Although the prevalence of reported requirements for influenza vaccination during the 2021–22 season increased by approximately 10 percentage points compared with those during the 2020–21 season, requirements for influenza vaccination were lower than were those for COVID-19 vaccination in most work settings, especially LTC settings. Requirements for COVID-19 booster vaccination were infrequently reported in all work settings by HCP who had completed the primary COVID-19 vaccination series, even among hospitals, a large percentage of which had requirements for influenza and COVID-19 primary vaccination. Thus, compared with primary COVID-19 vaccination coverage, influenza vaccination coverage was lower in nonhospital settings, and COVID-19 booster vaccination coverage was lower in all settings. Given that vaccine-induced immunity wanes over time after vaccination, remaining up to date with all COVID-19 recommended vaccination is important for all eligible persons to prevent COVID-19–related hospitalization and severe outcomes, and for HCP to protect their patients (3,8). In September 2022, CDC recommended an updated bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccination to provide enhanced protection against circulating strains of COVID-19 (9). The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, the study used a nonprobability sample of volunteer members of Medscape and Dynata Internet panels. Responses were weighted to be representative of the U.S. population of HCP; however, some bias might remain in the coverage estimates. Second, the self-selection of respondents to the panels and to the survey might introduce selection bias if participation in the panel or survey is related to likelihood of being vaccinated. Third, vaccination status was self-reported and might be subject to recall or social desirability bias. Finally, insufficient sample size resulted in the coverage estimates in some subgroups not meeting the National Center for Health Statistics reliability criteria for reporting proportions. HCP coverage with influenza vaccine, the primary COVID-19 vaccination series, and a booster COVID-19 dose was highest among those who reported employer vaccination requirements for the respective vaccines. Work settings that successfully implemented requirements for primary COVID-19 vaccination could consider the same requirements for COVID-19 booster doses to restore protection among HCP that has declined since their previous vaccination. In addition, many LTC settings now have experience implementing COVID-19 vaccine requirements and could consider these requirements for influenza vaccination to improve influenza vaccination coverage. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires that many health care settings report both influenza§§§ and COVID-19¶¶¶ HCP vaccination data to CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network; the interim final rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services also requires LTC settings to offer the COVID-19 vaccine to staff members and residents and to educate them about benefits and potential side effects, which might increase vaccination coverage in these settings.**** In addition, useful resources that can help to increase vaccination coverage among HCP include CDC’s long term care web-based toolkit,†††† which provides access to resources, strategies, and educational materials, and interventions recommended by the Community Preventive Services Task Force and CDC (4,10). Annual influenza vaccination and staying up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines are critical in prevention of severe disease as well as reduction of influenza and COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality among HCP and their patients.

For respondents whose initial vaccine was Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), completion of primary COVID-19 vaccination series was defined as the receipt of 1 dose for those who were not immunocompromised, or a second COVID-19 vaccine (either Janssen or mRNA) for those who were immunocompromised (because of solid organ transplant, blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune-weakening medicines). ¶¶ COVID-19 booster vaccination was defined as the receipt of a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine after completion of a 2-dose primary mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series for respondents who did not report being immunocompromised, or a fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine after completion of a 3-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series for respondents who reported being immunocompromised. For respondents whose initial vaccine was Janssen, booster vaccination was defined as the receipt of a second COVID-19 vaccine (either Janssen or mRNA) for respondents who were not immunocompromised or 3 total doses for respondents who were immunocompromised. *** Questions included, “Since July 1, 2021, has your employer recommended or required that you be vaccinated for flu?,” “Since December 2020, has your employer recommended or required that you be vaccinated for COVID-19?,” and “Has your employer recommended or required that you be vaccinated with a COVID-19 booster vaccine?” Analyses of employer requirements for COVID-19 vaccine booster doses were restricted to 2,256 HCP who completed the primary series and excluded 1,044 HCP who encountered an erroneous skip pattern, which was corrected on the second day of the survey. ††† https://www.aapor.org/AAPOR_Main/media/MainSiteFiles/NPS_TF_Report_Final_7_revised_FNL_6_22_13.pdf; https://www.aapor.org/getattachment/Education-Resources/For-Researchers/AAPOR_Guidance_Nonprob_Precision_042216.pdf §§§ https://www.cdc.govhsn/pdfs/cms/cms-reporting-requirements.pdf ¶¶¶ https://www.cdc.govhsn/pdfs/covid19/ltcf/cms-covid19-req-508.pdf **** https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-and-certificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/interim-final-rule-covid-19-vaccine-immunization-requirements-residents-and-staff †††† https://www.cdc.gov/fluoolkit/long-term-care/index.htm TopReferences Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; CDC.

However, the IAV PB2 protein that regulates the downstream signaling pathway of IFNs is not well characterized. Here, we report that IAV PB2 protein reduces cellular sensitivity to IFNs, suppressing the activation of STAT1/STAT2 and ISGs. Furthermore, IAV PB2 protein targets mammalian JAK1 at lysine 859 and 860 for ubiquitination and degradation. Notably, the H5 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus with I283M/K526R mutations on PB2 increases the ability to degrade mammalian JAK1 and exhibits higher replicate efficiency in mammalian (but not avian) cells and mouse lung tissues, and causes greater mortality in infected mice. Altogether, these data describe a negative regulatory mechanism involving PB2-JAK1 and provide insights into an evasion strategy from host antiviral immunity employed by IAV.

In the past century, IAVs (H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2), which all originated in whole or partly from non-human reservoirs, have caused four influenza pandemics and constant infection in the human population. Due to the host species barrier, it is difficult for the avian influenza virus (AIV) to spread from birds to humans directly. However, the emergence of H7N9 and H5Nx (i.e., H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8) AIV subtypes have caused hundreds of severe or fatal human cases and are of particular concern2,3,4,5. The H7N9 viruses were first detected in live poultry markets in China, and there have been over 1500 human infections caused by the H7N9 virus, with a mortality rate reaching 40%6. Human cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 AIVs continue throughout parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, causing several hundred human cases and deaths since 20037,8. To date, 78 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H5N6 viruses have been reported, including 33 deaths9. H5N8 AIV has emerged in Asia and Europe since 2014, causing massive deaths in poultry and wild birds5,10. The first case of humans infected with H5N8 viruses was reported in Russia in 202111, although fatal human cases of the H5N8 subtype have not been documented as yet.Host adaptation requires the viruses to overcome restriction barriers and replicate efficiently in a new host. To overcome host barriers, viruses must gain specificity for binding to cell receptors, adapt to host machinery for genome replication, transcription, and protein synthesis in cells, and evade restriction by elements of the host innate immune system during virus infection. AIVs obtain a series of mutations in their genomes to adapt to mammalian hosts before efficiently replicating and transmitting among humans. The PB2 protein of IAV is critical for viral replication and a key determinant of the host range12. The PB2 E627K substitution is a dominant adaptation marker in most human-adapted IAVs, facilitating replication in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the 590S/591R motif was found to complement the function of 627K in the PB2 of the 2009 H1N1 virus to allow replication in humans13. In addition, the 627K marker and, to a lesser extent, the 701N substitution have been described as critical for replicating H5N1 and H7N7 AIVs in mammalian hosts14,15. The host protein, ANP32A, has recently been found to play a role in restricting virus replication in mammalian cells through differential regulation of the activity of viral polymerases carrying PB2-627K (human) or PB2-627E (avian) signature16,17. 526R is another marker of mammalian adaption by AIVs, possibly functioning through interaction between viral PB2 and nuclear export protein (NEP) during virus replication18. We previously found that the synergistic effect of amino acid residues 283M and 526R in PB2 enhances the virulence of HPAI H5 viruses in mice by affecting the activity of the polymerase19. However, the effect of PB2 host-adaptive mutations is not limited to enhancing viral polymerase activity.The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against viral infection, and interferons (IFNs) are recognized as an essential component of the innate immune response20,21. Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signal transduction pathway are important in controlling immune responses, which mediates the functions of IFNs and other cytokines22. The IFNs are secreted and bind to the cognate IFN receptor (IFNAR) to activate the JAK/STAT signaling. JAK1 and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) phosphorylate STAT1/STAT2, forming the dimmer of STAT1/STAT2 and translocation into the nucleus and binding to a DNA element, thereby specifically triggering the transcription of a group of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These antiviral genes play an important role in establishing the antiviral response in host cells23.It is known that the binding of virus-induced cytokines to their receptors activates the JAK/STAT signaling. Although the JAK/STAT pathway is well-documented to be mainly activated through interferons for antiviral host defenses, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to combat antiviral defenses and establish an efficient infection. SARS-CoV-2 targets JAK1, Tyk2, and IFNAR subunit 1(IFNAR1) resulting in cellular desensitization to type I IFN24. The foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) degrades JAK1 via the lysosomal pathway, inhibiting the IFNγ signaling transduction pathway25. Zika virus (ZIKV) targets JAK1 for proteasomal degradation, suppressing JAK/STAT signaling and impairing interferon-mediated antiviral response26. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) inhibits the IFNα signal transduction pathway by inducing proteasome-dependent degradation of JAK127. Our previous work suggests that IAV infection induces SOCS1 expression to promote JAK1 degradation, inhibiting host innate immune responses28.Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification process critical for cellular regulating processes such as protein degradation and signaling transducing pathways. Viruses, including IAV, have hijacked the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to evade innate immune responses and promote proper infection29,30,31. IAV NS1 protein interacts with TRIM25 and then regulates host immune gene expression32,33. Hemagglutinin of IAV leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR134. This study describes how the IAV PB2 protein negatively regulates IFNs response. Intriguingly, this involves direct ubiquitination and degradation of the JAK1, a mechanism not yet described for any other influenza viral protein.ResultsIAV PB2 inhibits IFN-mediated signalingTo elucidate whether IAV PB2 protein may regulate IFN-mediated induction of antiviral genes, we chose two representative strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1, PR8) and A/goose/Eastern China/CZ/2013 (H5N8, CZ), to construct 3xFlag-tagged expression plasmids encoding their PB2 protein. We then explored their ability to regulate the activation of the IFNβ, ISRE, and NF-κB promoter triggered by Sendai virus (SeV) (Fig. 1a) infection or transfected cytoplasmic poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of viral dsRNA (Fig. 1b). The results showed that PB2 inhibited SeV, or poly(I:C)-induced activation of the IFNβ, ISRE, or NF-κB promoter (Fig. 1a, b). Overexpression of PB2 also inhibited the activation of ISRE and STAT1 promoter triggered by IFNβ (Fig. 1c) or IFNα (Fig. 1d). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis indicated that overexpression of PB2 significantly inhibited IFNs-triggered transcription of the interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) and IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) in human A549 cells (Fig. 1e, f). Since PB2 inhibited the transcription of virus-triggered host genes, we next investigated whether PB2 plays a role in the cellular antiviral response. As shown in Fig. 1g, ultraviolet radiation-inactivated supernatants from PB2-transfected HEK293T cells which were infected with SeV could not completely inhibit the replication of GFP-expressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-GFP) as monitored by the GFP signal, which suggested that PB2 dampened the secretion of antiviral factors induced by SeV (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 1). Further, IFNs-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 were markedly inhibited by PB2 (Fig. 1h, i). Altogether, these data suggest that PB2 protein is a generally negative regulator of the IFNs-triggered antiviral response.Fig. 1: IAV PB2 protein inhibits IFN signaling pathway.a, b Luciferase activity in HEK293T cells transfected with IFNβ promoter, ISRE or NF-κB luciferase reporter, Renilla luciferase plasmid, and PB2 plasmids (including NS1-PR8 and empty vector [Vec] were chosen as positive and negative controls, respectively) and treated with SeV (a) or poly(I:C) (b) (n = 3 biologically independent samples). c, d Luciferase activity in HEK293T cells transfected with ISRE or STAT1 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid, Renilla luciferase plasmid, and PB2 plasmids and treated with IFNβ (c) or IFNα (d) (n = 3 biologically independent samples). e, f qPCR analysis of IFIT1 and ISG15 mRNA in A549 cells transfected with PB2 plasmids and treated with IFNβ (e) or IFNα (f); mRNA results are presented relative to those of untreated cells transfected with a control plasmid (n = 3 biologically independent samples). g HEK293T cells were transfected with PB2 or NS1 plasmid and infected with SeV.

Indeed, The PB2 proteins from PR8 or CZ could downregulate endogenous JAK1 protein levels, but not IFNAR1 and STAT1 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Additionally, when HEK293T cells were transfected with JAK1-His or Flag-STAT1 along with increasing amounts of PB2 from PR8 or CZ, we observed dose-dependent reductions in the levels of JAK1-His (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2b), but not STAT1 (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2c). In contrast, PB2 expression did not alter the mRNA level of JAK1 (Fig. 2d). Following PR8 or CZ infection, the expression level of JAK1 was decreased in A549 cells (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 2d). Further, we employed short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of PB2 expression, and we generated two shPB2 stable HEK293T cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Knockdown of PB2 decreased the degradation of endogenous JAK1 after PR8 virus infection (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 2e). Moreover, we generated a PB2-mutant with a 5-nucleotide nonsense mutation in the target sequence of the shPB2 plasmids (ΔPB2) (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c). Both ΔPB2 and PB2 dramatically inhibited the expression of JAK1 in shGFP cells (Supplementary Fig. 3d), while ΔPB2, but not PB2, dramatically inhibited the expression of JAK1 in stable PB2 knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. 3d). In addition, the degradation of JAK1 induced by CHX was more strongly in the presence of PB2 protein, indicating that PB2 decreased the stability of JAK1 protein (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 2f).Fig. 2: IAV PB2 promotes the degradation of JAK1.a Immunoblots of HEK293T cells were transfected with different concentrations of PB2 plasmids from PR8 (left) or CZ (right). b, c Immunoblots of HEK293T cells transfected with JAK1-His (b) or Flag-STAT1 (c) with different concentrations of PB2 plasmids. d qPCR analysis of JAK1 mRNA level in A549 cells transfected with different concentrations of PB2 plasmids (n = 3 biologically independent samples).

Data are one representative of three independent experiments.Full size imageThe ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways are two different systems that control protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. We found that PB2-mediated JAK1 degradation could be mostly restored by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, but not the lysosome inhibitor ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), or chloroquine (CQ) (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 2g). Collectively, these results suggest that PB2 mediates the degradation of JAK1 through the proteasome machinery.IAV PB2 mediates polyubiquitination degradation of JAK1As the ubiquitin system plays an important role in regulating protein degradation, we determined if PB2 promotes the ubiquitination of JAK1. As anticipated, we found that PB2 from PR8 or CZ potentiated JAK1 ubiquitination in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). Since different polyubiquitination processes, including K48-, K63-, K11-, and K27-linked ubiquitination, have been implicated in deliberately regulating protein fate. We set out to analyze which type of JAK1 ubiquitination could be induced by PB2. Overexpression of PB2 markedly promoted K48-linked ubiquitination of JAK1 but had no appreciable effect on the ubiquitination of JAK1 with other linkages (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4a). We used reverse ubiquitin mutants to confirm these results, where only one lysine residue, K48, is mutated to arginine. The level of JAK1 ubiquitination was consistently lower upon expression of Ub-K48R, firmly establishing that the PB2 mediates K48-linked ubiquitination of JAK1 (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Moreover, we found that IAV infection enhanced the K48-linked ubiquitination of endogenous JAK1 (Fig. 3c). In contrast, knockdown of PB2 inhibited the IAV-induced K48-linked endogenous ubiquitination of JAK1 (Fig. 3d). These data suggest that PB2 promotes K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of JAK1 by the proteasome pathway.Fig. 3: IAV PB2 protein increases the K48-linked ubiquitination of JAK1.a Ni-NTA pull-down analysis of the ubiquitination of JAK1 in HEK293T cells transfected with JAK1-His, HA-ubiquitin (HA-Ub), and PB2 plasmids and treated with MG132. b Ni-NTA pull-down analysis of the ubiquitination of JAK1 in HEK293T cells transfected with JAK1-His, HA-Ub, or its mutants K48 and K63 [K at indicated residue, and K at other residues were simultaneously mutated to arginines], and PB2 plasmids and treated with MG132. c Co-IP analysis of the ubiquitination of JAK1 in A549 cells infected with PR8 or CZ at an MOI of 0.01. d Co-ip analysis of the ubiquitination of JAK1 in stable PB2 knockdown HEK293T cells infected with PR8 virus. WCL, whole-cell lysates. Data are one representative of three independent experiments.Full size imageThe Lysine 859 and 860 residues of JAK1 are critical for efficient PB2-mediated degradationThe JAKs contain seven conserved, termed JAK homology (JH) regions35. The C-terminal half of the JAK, domains JH1 (amino acids 851-1154) and JH2 (amino acids 560-851), the JH1 domain, a classical tyrosine kinase domain, the pseudokinase domain (JH2) that may play a regulatory role36,37. The N-terminal half of the JAK1, domains JH3 to JH7, contains a predicted FERM domain and a putative SH235. To identify the specific domain of JAK1 necessary for ubiquitination and degradation, we designed and constructed the following truncate plasmids: JAK1-1-559aa (amino acids 1-559), JAK1-560-1154aa (amino acids 560-1154), JAK1-1-850aa (amino acids 1-850), and JAK1-851-1154aa (amino acids 851-1154) (Fig. 4a). JAK1-WT, JAK1-851-1154aa, and JAK1-560-1154aa, but not JAK1-1-559aa and JAK1-1-850aa, were extensively degraded by PB2 (Fig. 4a). We next investigated which lysine residues in JAK1 are targeted by PB2. To this end, we mutated a series of lysines of JAK1 (Fig. 4b) and examined their effects on PB2-mediated JAK1 degradation. As shown in Fig. 4c–e, only simultaneous mutations of Lysine 859 and Lysine 860 to Arginine (K859/860R) abolished PB2-mediated degradation of JAK1 (Fig. 4c–e). To further dissect the ubiquitination of JAK1 at K859/K860 residues, JAK1-WT, JAK1(K859R), or JAK1(K860R) was strongly ubiquitinated when HA-tagged wild-type ubiquitin was expressed, whereas ubiquitination of JAK1 (K859/860R) was significantly reduced (Fig. 4f, g). These data indicate that the Lysine 859 and 860 residues of JAK1 are critical for PB2-mediated degradation.Fig. 4: PB2-mediated JAK1 degradation at residues 859K and 860K.a Schematic representation of the deletion mutants of JAK1 (upper) and immunoblots of HEK293T cells transfected with JAK1 or its deletion mutants and PB2 plasmids (lower). b Ubiquitination modification online prediction of JAK1 by CPLM 1.0. c Immunoblots of HEK293T cells transfected with JAK1 or its mutants and PB2 plasmids. d Intensities analysis of the bands on the immunoblots (c) from three independent experiments.

Data are one representative of three independent experiments.Full size imageDegradation of JAK1 via K859/K860 ubiquitination enhances IAV replicationTo investigate the role of JAK1 degradation during IAV replication, we first determined if overexpression of JAK1 affects IAV replication. Infection experiments showed that transient overexpression of JAK1 in HEK293T cells reduced PR8 (Fig. 5a) or CZ (Fig. 5b) viral replication. To further understand the endogenous role of JAK1 during IAV infection, we employed shRNA-mediated knockdown of JAK1 expression (Fig. 5c). The results showed that viral titers were facilitated in JAK1-deficient cells (Fig. 5d, e). To verify the effects of JAK1 (K859/K860) on IAV replication, we generated a JAK1-mutant with a 7-nucleotide nonsense mutation in the target sequence of the shJAK1 plasmids (ΔJAK1) (Fig. 5f, g). Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type JAK1 but not the K859/860R mutants JAK1 reduced virus replication in shJAK1 cells, suggesting that mutants of K859/860R damaged JAK1-mediated antiviral activity (Fig. 5h, i). Altogether, our results indicate that JAK1 ubiquitination degradation at K859/K860 residues is critical for efficient IAV replication.Fig. 5: The effects of JAK1 on IAV replication.a, b Viral titers in HEK293T cells transfected with JAK1 plasmid and infected with PR8 virus (a) or CZ virus (b) (n = 3 biologically independent samples). c Immunoblots of HEK293T cells transfected with control shRNA (shGFP) or shRNA targeting JAK1 (shJAK1) and JAK1 plasmids. d, e Viral titers in shJAK1 HEK293T cells infected with PR8 virus (d) or CZ virus (e) (n = 3 biologically independent samples). hpi, h post-infection. f JAK1 was replaced with an shRNA off-target JAK1 mutant (ΔJAK1) with a 7-nucleotide nonsense mutation in the target sequence of the shJAK1 plasmid. g Immunoblots of stable JAK1 knockdown HEK293T cells transfected with JAK1-His, ΔJAK1-His, or ΔJAK1-K859/860R-His plasmid (upper).

Statistical significance in a, b, d, e, g–i was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. ns P > 0.05.Full size imageJAK1 interacts with IAV PB2We then determined whether JAK1 was associated with PB2. First, we examined if JAK1 physically interacts with PB2. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Ni-NTA pull-down experiments were performed. IP 3xFlag-PB2 was able to bring down His-tagged JAK1, and 3xFlag-PB2 can be pulled down with His-tagged JAK1 (Fig. 6a), indicating a physical interaction of the two proteins. Second, as PB2 is associated with viral RNA, we further determined whether the interaction between PB2 and JAK1 is mediated by RNA. RNase A treatment was used to evaluate the effect of RNA on the binding of PB2 with JAK1. RNase A completely degraded RNA extracted from cells (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Regardless of RNase A treatment, 3xFlag-PB2 could be pulled down by the Ni-NTA from cells co-expressing JAK1-His (Supplementary Fig. 5b), suggesting RNA-independent interactions between PB2 and JAK1. Next, IP and Ni-NTA pull-down experiments further verified that PB2 was associated with JAK1 following IAV infection (Fig. 6b). Moreover, we examined the subcellular distribution of JAK1 upon influenza virus infection at 12 h. JAK1 was evenly distributed in the whole-cell cytosol in mock-infected cells (Fig. 6c). At 12 h post-infection (p.i), JAK1 was present predominately in the cytoplasm and co-localized with PB2 protein to form punctate bodies (Fig. 6c).Fig. 6: JAK1 interacts with IAV PB2.a Co-ip and Ni-NTA pull-down analysis of the interaction of PB2 with JAK1 in HEK293T cells transfected PB2 and JAK1 plasmids. b Co-ip and Ni-NTA pull-down analysis of the interaction of PB2 with JAK1 in HEK293T cells transfected with JAK1 plasmids and infected with PR8 or CZ virus. c Colocalization of endogenous JAK1 (green) and PB2 (red) in PR8 or CZ-infected A549 cells.

WCL whole-cell lysates, HC Heavy Chain, LC Light Chain. Data are one representative of three independent experiments.Full size imageIAV PB2 protein is comprised of five major domains: N-terminal PB1 Binding Domain (PBD, amino acids 1–240), Middle Domain (MD, amino acids 241–322), Cap Binding Domain (CBD, amino acids 323–485), RNA Binding Domain (RBD, amino acids 486–532) and C-terminal Nuclear import Domain (NID, amino acids 533–759) (Fig. 6d). We conducted IP and Ni-NTA pull-down experiments and confirmed that the CBD and RBD, but not the PBD, MD, and NID are the interacting domain of PB2 for binding to JAK1 (Fig. 6e, f).In an attempt to map the region of JAK1 responsible for interaction with PB2, we designed and constructed the following truncate plasmids: JAK1-301–1154aa (amino acids 301–1154), JAK1-1-435aa (amino acids 1–435), JAK1-436-1154aa (amino acids 436–1154), JAK1-1-559aa (amino acids 1–559), JAK1-1-850aa (amino acids 1–850), and JAK1-851-1154aa (amino acids 851–1154) (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Deletion of the kinase-like and Kinase domains (amino acids 560-1154) completely abolished the binding of JAK1 to PB2, whereas JAK1 with any other mutant domains had a binding affinity similar to that of full-length JAK1 (Supplementary Fig. 5d), indicating that the kinase-like and kinase domains of JAK1 are the interacting domains for binding to PB2, which differs from the SH2 domains (amino acids 436–560) of JAK1 for cytokine receptor binding38,39. Altogether, these data indicate that JAK1 interacts with IAV PB2.PB2s of H5 subtype AIVs degrade mammalian JAK1 differentlyA previous study identified 283M/526R of PB2 from CZ as a virulence marker in mice compared to A/duck/Eastern China/JY/2014 (JY)19. To investigate the role of PB2s of different H5 subtype AIVs on JAK1 degradation, HEK293T cells were transfected with JAK1-His and PB2M (M283I/R526K)-CZ, PB2-CZ, PB2-JY, or PB2M (I283M/K526R)-JY. Intriguingly, we found that the PB2 from JY displays no degradation of JAK1 (Fig. 7a). Notably, PB2-CZ or PB2M-JY, but not PB2M-CZ, induced the degradation of JAK1 (Fig. 7a). In addition, we observed PB2-CZ, PB2-CZ-M283I, and PB2-CZ-R526K, but not PB2M-CZ downregulate JAK1 protein levels (Fig. 7b), indicating a synergistic effect of PB2 283M and 526R contributes to JAK1 degradation. To investigate the effect of 283M and 526R of PB2 on JAK1 interaction. IP assay revealed that the JAK1 protein is bound with PB2-CZ more than PB2-JY (Fig. 7c). The PB2M-CZ substantially decreased its binding to JAK1 compared with PB2-CZ, whereas the PB2M-JY showed the opposite results (Fig. 7c).Fig. 7: PB2s of H5 subtype AIVs degrade mammalian JAK1 differently.a Immunoblots of HEK293T cells transfected with JAK1 and PB2-CZ, PB2M-CZ (M283I-R526K), PB2-JY, or PB2M-JY (I283M-K526R) plasmids (upper).

WCL, whole-cell lysates. Statistical significance in a, b was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. ns P > 0.05. Data are one representative of three independent experiments.Full size imageFurthermore, we examined whether IAV PB2 co-localizes with JAK1 in the same cell compartments by fluorescence microscopy. As anticipated, PB2-JY is consistently localized primarily in the nucleus, as PB2 contains a nuclear localization sequence (Fig. 7d). However, JAK1 did not co-localize with PB2-JY (Fig. 7d). Then, we used recombinant viruses with double substitutions (I283M/K526R) in the PB2 and tested their localization. JAK1 co-localized with PB2 appeared in CZ-infected cells (Fig. 6c), but this colocalization was not observed in double substitutions (PB2-M283I/R526K-CZ) in the rCZM-infected cells (Fig. 7d). In contrast, this colocalization was observed in double substitutions (PB2-I283M/K526R-JY) in the rJYM-infected cells (Fig. 7d).Although most PB2 protein in infected cells localizes to the nucleus, PB2 was also detected in the mitochondria40,41. To assess the effect of 283M/526R on PB2 proteins intracellular distribution, A549 cells were infected with rCZ, rJY, rCZM, and rJYM, respectively. At 6 and 12 hpi, mitochondria were labeled with MitoTracker Red, and PB2 proteins were detected via indirect immunofluorescence. The PB2 protein from the rCZ virus displayed significant levels of the mitochondrial signal at 12 hpi, as expected (Supplementary Fig. 6). Surprisingly, we also found that PB2 proteins from the other three H5N8 viruses, in contrast with the rCZ virus, do not associate with mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. 6). Interestingly, PB2-JY and PB2M-CZ proteins localized primarily to the nucleus in infected cells, while PB2-CZ and PB2M-JY can also be observed in the cytoplasm. To further understand whether the PB2-JAK1 interaction affects the ubiquitination degradation of JAK1. The results showed that PB2-CZ or PB2M-JY, but not PB2-JY or PB2M-CZ promoted the K48-linked ubiquitination of JAK1 (Fig. 7e).The Lysine 859 and 860 residues of JAK1 are critical for efficient ubiquitination and degradation of JAK1 mediated by PB2-CZ, which are also highly conserved among various species (Supplementary Fig. 7a). We tested the ability of PB2 from CZ or JY to interact with chicken JAK1 (chJAK1). Immunoblotting and IP experiments showed that PB2-CZ and PB2-JY efficiently interacted with chJAK1 for degradation (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). Moreover, we observed that both PB2-CZ and PB2-JY promoted the ubiquitination of chJAK1 (Supplementary Fig. 7d). These results collectively demonstrate that the PB2s of H5 subtype AIVs are different in mammalian JAK1 degradation, not in avian JAK1 degradation.AIV PB2 inhibits the JAK1/STAT1 signaling pathway by degrading JAK1Given that the protein level of JAK1 could affect cellular sensitivity to IFNs and the PB2 proteins from H5 AIVs has different ability to degrade mammalian JAK1, we sought to gain insight into the regulatory function of PB2s from different H5 AIVs in the IFNs mediated signaling pathway. First, the transcription profiling of ISGs such as IFIT1, ISG15, and TAP1 in response to IFNβ in the presence or absence of AIV PB2 was analyzed by qPCR. PB2-CZ and PB2M-JY, but not PB2M-CZ and PB2-JY, were shown to substantially inhibit IFNs-triggered transcription of IFIT1, ISG15, and TAP1 (Fig. 8a, b). Second, the promoter activity of the ISRE and STAT1 in response to IFNs was measured by luciferase reporter assay. Following the treatment with IFNβ and IFNα, the ISRE and STAT1 promoter’s relative activities were markedly suppressed by the expression of PB2-CZ and PB2M-JY, but not PB2M-CZ and PB2-JY (Fig. 8c, d).Fig. 8: AIV PB2 inhibits IFN-mediated signaling by JAK1 degradation.a, b qPCR analysis of IFIT1, ISG15, and TAP1 mRNA in A549 cells transfected with PB2 or its mutant plasmids and treated with IFNβ (a) or IFNα (b) (n = 3 biologically independent samples). c, d Luciferase activity in HEK293T cells transfected with ISRE or STAT1 promoter-luciferase reporter, Renilla luciferase plasmid, and PB2 or its mutants plasmids and treated with IFNβ (c) or IFNα (d) (n = 3 biologically independent samples). e, f Immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated and total STAT in HEK293T cells transfected with PB2 or its mutant plasmids and treated with IFNβ (e) or IFNα (f) (upper).

Data are presented as the mean ± SD and are one representative of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. ns P > 0.05.Full size imageWe next investigated the activation of STAT1 in response to IFNs in the presence or absence of PB2 expression. Exogenous addition of IFNs elicited STAT1 activation, as evidenced by the heightened phosphorylation level of STAT1. However, PB2-CZ and PB2M-JY, not PB2M-CZ and PB2-JY expression, inhibited the IFNβ (Fig. 8e) or IFNα (Fig. 8f) induced pSTAT1/pSTAT2. Since PB2 degrades JAK1 at lysine 859 and 860 residues, we investigated the effect of JAK1 (K859/860R) on the IFN-induced expression of ISGs. The results revealed that IFNβ-induced levels of ISG15, IFIT1, and TAP1 mRNA were enhanced only in the shJAK1 cells transfected with JAK1(WT)-expressing plasmid, not in those transfected with JAK1 (K859/860 R)-expressing plasmid (Fig. 8g), suggesting the mutations of K859/860R reduce JAK1-mediated antiviral immune response. These results indicate that PB2-mediated JAK1 degradation robustly decreases cellular sensitivity to IFN.AIV PB2-mediated JAK1 degradation is critical for virus transcription and replication in vitroTo further identify the effect of JAK1 degradation by AIV PB2 on virus replication. A549 cells were infected with these recombinant AIVs. The expression levels of viral proteins PB2 and NP were significantly decreased in rCZM virus-infected cells compared to rCZ infected cells (Fig. 9a). Moreover, the viral proteins were significantly increased in rJYM virus-infected cells compared to rJY-infected cells (Fig. 9b). Meanwhile, rCZM infection-induced less JAK1 degradation than rCZ infection (Fig. 9a). Consistently, rJYM infection-induced more JAK1 degradation than rJY infection (Fig. 9b), suggesting the PB2 degrades JAK1 to benefit IAV replication. Further, we compared the rCZ, rJY, rCZM, and rJYM viruses’ growth curves in mammalian-origin A549 cells and avian-origin DF-1 cells. In A549 cells, the virus titer of rCZ was higher than that of rCZM at 12 hpi, and the growth of rCZ was faster than that of rCZM (106.5 PFU/ml vs. 104.5 PFU/ml at 48 hpi), indicating that the M283I/R526K mutation of PB2 weakened the replication ability of rCZ (Fig. 9c left). In contrast, the rJYM virus displayed more replication than the parental rJY virus observed in virus titers at late time points (105.3 PFU/ml vs. 104.2 PFU/ml at 72 hpi) (Fig. 9c right). While all of these viruses grew similarly and efficiently in DF-1 cells and reached the maximum titers of approximately 107.3 TCID50/mL at 72 hpi (Fig. 9d). Importantly, the size of the plaques formed by rCZM in MDCK cells was significantly smaller than those formed by rCZ as measured by mean diameter (0.74 mm vs. 1.31 mm, in Fig. 9e) and the size of the plaques formed by rJYM in MDCK cells was bigger than those formed by rJY as measured by mean diameter (0.80 mm vs. 0.10 mm, in Fig. 9e).Fig. 9: JAK1 degradation mediated by AIV PB2 affects virus replication in mammalian cells.a, b Immunoblots of A549 cells infected with rCZ, rCZM, rJY, or rJYM virus (left).

Data are presented as the mean ± SD. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. ns P > 0.05.Full size imageNext, we examined the levels of viral mRNA, cRNA, and vRNA in A549 cells or DF-1 cells infected with rCZ, rJY, rCZM, or rJYM at 12 hpi. The results showed that A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. 8a–c), but not DF-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 8d-f) infected with viruses carrying 283M/526R PB2 have significantly higher levels of viral nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA, cRNA, and vRNA, as compared with cells infected with a virus-containing 283I/526K PB2 (Supplementary Fig. 8), suggesting 283M/526R are critical for viral transcription and replication in mammalian cells. Altogether, these data indicate that the AIV PB2-mediated JAK1 degradation benefits virus replication in mammalian cells.AIV PB2-mediated JAK1 degradation significantly increases viral pathogenicity in miceSince downregulation of JAK1 is critical for efficient IAV replication in vitro, it is most probable that the level of JAK1 degradation by PB2 could be related to viral pathogenicity. To test this hypothesis, we intranasally infected 4–6 weeks mice with rCZ, rJY, rCZM, and rJYM viruses and monitored their weight loss and survival for two weeks. The mice infected with rCZM exhibited lower body weight loss and morbidity than infection with rCZ (Fig. 10a, b). Consistently, the mice infected with rJYM exhibited more significant weight loss and a higher level of morbidity than those in the rJY group (Fig. 10a, b).Fig. 10: JAK1 degradation mediated by AIV PB2 significantly increases the virulence of AIV in mice.a, b The mice (n = 10 per group) were intranasally inoculated (106 EID50 per mouse) with rJY, rJYM, rCZ, or rCZM virus and monitored for 14 d for body weight loss (a) and survival (b). c Gloss lesions of lungs from the infected mice on 2 and 5 dpi.

Data are presented as the mean ± SD. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test in a, d, f, h, j–l or log-rank test in b.Full size imageNotably, severe pneumonia was observed via gross and histopathological lesions in the lung tissues of mice inoculated with rJYM and rCZ viruses on 2 and 5 days post-infection (dpi), characterized by consolidation, hemorrhages, and edema (Fig. 10c). In contrast, little or no lung consolidation was observed in mice infected with rJY and rCZM virus at 2 dpi (Fig. 10c). Compared with the rCZ group, the virus titer in the lung of rCZM group was lower (Fig. 10d). Of note, in lung tissue, mice infected with rJYM displayed a higher viral titer than rJY (Fig. 10d). Furthermore, histopathological assessment of lungs from the infected mice showed that rCZ caused serious bronchiolitis and obvious inflammatory cell infiltration on 2 dpi, and progressed to bronchopneumonia on 5 dpi (Fig. 10e, f). In contrast, rCZM-infected mice showed moderate pathogenic changes on 5 dpi (Fig. 10e, f). Consistently, rJYM-infected mice showed the extent of bronchiolitis was markedly increased compared with rJY on 5 dpi (Fig. 10e, f). In addition, viral protein NP staining was more intense in lung sections of mice infected with rJYM or rCZ than in corresponding mice infected with rJY or rCZM (Fig. 10g, h).Lung tissues of infected mice were examined further to determine the relationship between viral infection and JAK1. Consistently, the expression of JAK1 was lower in the lungs of mice infected with rJYM or rCZ than that of mice infected with rJY or rCZM (Fig. 10i, j). We also analyzed the levels of ISGs mRNA in the lungs of mice infected with the variant or the WT (Fig. 10k, l). On 2 dpi, the levels of ISG15 (Fig. 10k) and IFIT1 (Fig. 10l) mRNA in the mice infected with the rJY or rCZM were higher than the levels in the mice infected with the rJYM or rCZ. Altogether, these results demonstrated that PB2-mediated JAK1 degradation significantly increases the virulence of AIV in mice.DiscussionIAVs are among the most common contagious pathogens to cause severe respiratory infections. Host cells have developed multiple branches of the innate immune system to defend against IAV infection, including activation of the IFNs system. However, IAVs also developed diverse strategies to antagonize the IFNs system for better infection. This study identified IAV PB2 protein as a negative regulator of JAK1 to attenuate the IFNs-induced antiviral response. IAV PB2 mediates polyubiquitination and degradation of JAK1 at lysines 859 and 860, which contribute to viral replication in mammalian cells and pathogenicity in a mouse model.The virulence of an influenza virus depends on many factors, such as cell tropism, replicate efficiency, and host immunity. Innate immunity plays a key role in host defense against IAV infection. The IFNs are secreted and bind to the cognate receptor to activate the JAK/STAT signal pathway, thereby inducing the expression of ISGs, which include Mx142, ISG1543, and TAP144, that can repress IAV replication. The influenza virus has devised diverse strategies to interfere with producing IFNs and ISGs. For example, influenza viral proteins such as NS145, PB246, and PB1-F247 were reported to have the ability to disrupt the signaling pathways of IFN synthesis. The influenza viral protein NS1 inhibits IFN production by inhibiting the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIM25-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of the viral RNA sensor RIG-I32,33, while influenza NS1 protein targets TRIM25 in a species-specific manner for the inhibition of RIG-I ubiquitination and antiviral IFN production48. Recent research also shows that NS1 binds to interferon-inducible protein IFI35 in a strain-specific manner, NS1 encoded by swine (H3N2), but not avian (H7N9/2013), interacts with IFI35, hence affecting RIG-I mediated innate antiviral response49. In addition, NS1 was shown to regulate JAK/STAT signaling by binding to and degrading the DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B)50. Previous research has reported that PB2 can interact with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) to disrupt IFN induction46. The present study demonstrates that PB2 protein attenuated cellular responses to IFNs by degrading JAK1. This strategy could potently repress JAK1/STAT signaling, creating a cellular environment favorable for the replication and propagation of the influenza virus.Many RNA viruses or viral proteins prohibit STAT1/2 activation from hindering ISGs production. SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and nsp6 antagonize IFN-I signaling through blocking STAT1/STAT2 phosphorylation or nuclear translocation51. The V proteins of the Nipah virus and Hendra virus block IFNβ and IFNγ signaling pathways by preventing the phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of STAT152,53. However, the V protein of the Measles virus blocks IFNα/β but not IFNγ signaling by inhibiting STAT1/STAT2 phosphorylation54. In addition, FMDV VP3 prevents IFN-induced STAT1-activated tyrosine phosphorylation and blocks the nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated STAT125. In the present study, we revealed that PB2 weakened the activation of STAT1/STAT2 and reduced the phosphorylation of STAT1/STAT2 by targeting JAK1 for degradation. Our detailed biochemical analysis revealed that the C-terminal JH2 and JH1 domains of JAK1 are associated with CBD and RBD of PB2. JH2 domain of JAK1 is an active tyrosine kinase, while the JH1 domain of JAK1 is a pseudokinase domain that regulates both basal and cytokine-induced activation. However, the JH2 domain of JAK1 is the primary site for PB2-mediated degradation, and the Lys 859 and 860 residues in the JH2 domain of JAK1 are critical for efficient PB2-mediated degradation (Fig. 4). In addition, we found that the PB2 protein of H9N2/TX, H7N9/GD, H5N1/YZ, and H5N1/DT influenza viruses also promote the degradation of JAK1 (Supplementary Fig. 9), suggesting a general degradation JAK1 effect of PB2 from different influenza virus subtypes.The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a key player in signal transduction pathways, including innate immune responses. Ubiquitylation modification is increasingly recognized as a key strategy used by viral pathogens to modulate host factors critical for infection. K48-linked polyubiquitin chains play a vital role in protein degradation by targeting proteins to the proteasome. IAV can use the UPS to evade the host’s immune system. IAV HA expression leads to IFNAR1 ubiquitination and degradation to attenuate the IFN-induced antiviral signaling pathway34. The viral NS1 protein, a well-known virulence factor, developed many mechanisms to antagonize innate immunity, from direct interactions with UPS factors, such as TRIM25, OUTB1, and MDM2, to the general inhibition of host gene expression29,32,55,56. Ubiquitination assay confirmed that PB2 catalyzed the formation of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to JAK1 at lysine 859 and 860 residues. As expected, PB2 markedly downregulated the mRNA abundance of IFN-stimulated cytokines, including ISG15, IFIT1, and TAP1, in response to IFNs treatment. It is conceivable that IAV PB2 causes JAK1 degradation, which helps the virus escape the powerful IFNs system, which may correlate with viral pathogenesis. Interestingly, although mutation of K859/860R of JAK1 led to its degradation resistance, these mutations also weakened JAK1-mediated antiviral immune response (Fig. 8g), which could explain why reconstitution of the JAK1 K859/860R mutants did not restore the antiviral activity of JAK1 in the shJAK1 cells (Fig. 5h, i). These data suggest that K859/860 is the essential site for both JAK1 ubiquitination and JAK1-mediated ISGs antiviral activity.Host adaptation requires the virus to overcome restriction barriers and replicate efficiently in a new host. Given the complicated replication process and life cycle of IAV, there are multiple host constraints for different stages of viral replication. For instance, RIG-I directly binds to incoming nucleocapsids, with enhanced specificity for PB2-627E RNP complexes, following the viral genome release from endosomes during influenza virus infection57. Nuclear import is another barrier that determines the replication efficiency of the influenza virus and is associated with PB2 host adaptation58. The effect of PB2 host adaptations on viral polymerase activity has been extensively studied, with the host factor ANP32A recently being found to restrict viral polymerase activity17. Here, we found that the PB2s of H5 subtype AIVs had a different ability for JAK1 degradation in mammalian cells, consisting of virus replication in mammalian cells and virus pathogenicity in mice. The rJY strain formed much smaller plaques in MDCK cells than the rCZ strain, and its growth kinetics were also severely compromised in A549 cells due to defective in degrading JAK1 (Fig. 9). Consistent with the in vitro growth properties, the recombinant viruses with weak JAK1 degradation ability and strong JAK1-mediated ISGs expression exhibited lower replicate efficiency in mouse lung tissue and caused less weight loss and mortality in infected mice (Fig. 10). Therefore, the ability of AIV PB2 for JAK1 degradation is related to its virulence in mammalian.In summary, we propose a working model for the regulatory role of the PB2 protein of IAV in the JAK1-mediated signaling pathway. IAV PB2 protein blocks JAK1/STAT signaling by targeting JAK1 for degradation through the proteasome machinery (Supplementary Fig. 10). IAV PB2 protein-mediated JAK1 degradation is critical for inhibiting antiviral IFNs response, which enhances understanding of the viral immune evasion mechanism. The ability of PB2 protein-mediated JAK1 degradation is also identified as a molecular marker for AIVs adaptation to mammals, which facilitates the surveillance of AIVs for cross-species transmission.MethodsEthics statementAnimal experiments were conducted following guidelines for experimental animals’ welfare and ethics.

Primer sequences used for cloning are available upon request. According to the manufacturer’s recommendations for transient expression, all constructs were validated by sequencing and were transfected into cells using Transfection Reagent (BioBEST).RNA interferenceThe sequences of the 2 vector-based shRNAs targeting different regions of PB2 or JAK1 mRNA transcript were: 5′-GCTGTGACATGGTGGAATAGG-3′ (shPB2-1#), and 5′-GCTAAAGCATGGAACCTTTGG-3′ (shPB2-2#); 5′-GCTCTGGTATGCTCCAAATCG-3′ (shJAK1-1#), and 5′-GGTGGAAGTGATCTTCTATCT-3′ (shJAK1-2#). An shRNA targeting enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was used as a negative control. The shRNA-mediated in vitro screening assay was used to generate the stable specific knockdown cell lines64,65. Briefly, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with shRNAs expressed in plasmids against the PB2 or JAK1 and the corresponding plasmids expressing the full-length PB2 or JAK1. The interference efficiency of each shRNA clone in silencing the expressed relevant protein was assessed by immunoblotting with indicated antibody. The efficiency shRNA was then packaged into a lentivirus to infect HEK293T cells. After puromycin selection, the stable HEK293T cell line with the downregulated PB2 or JAK1 was established after continuous selection for 3 weeks, when the control mock-infected HEK293T cells died out completely.RT-qPCR analysisAccording to the manufacturer’s instructions, total RNA was purified using Trizol Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and was treated with DNase I (Thermo Scientific) to remove contaminated DNAs.

Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. At 24 h post-transfection (hpt), the cells were infected with SeV (MOI = 1) for another 24 h. The supernatants were harvested and inactivated by placing the samples on ice with a 30-W ultraviolet radiation lamp for 20 min. The ultraviolet radiation-inactivated supernatant was added to fresh confluent cells and incubated for 24 h. The cells were then infected at an MOI of 0.1 with VSV-GFP. At 12 hpi, VSV-GFP replication was visualized by monitoring the GFP expression level by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry.Confocal immunofluorescence assayCoverslip adhered A549 cell monolayers were infected with IAV for indicated times. Treated cells were washed twice with Phosphate Buffered Saline-Tween 20 (PBST), fixed with cold acetone/methanol (1/1) for 20 min, and then air-dried. The fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight. Cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor™ 488 or Alexa Fluor™ 594. at 37 °C for 1 h. Cellular nuclei were stained with DAPI for 20 min. The triply-stained cells were washed thrice with PBS. Images were obtained with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope and analyzed using LAS X Software (V3.7.4).Immunoblotting and Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)Samples were prepared and treated as described above, and cell monolayers were washed with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, and an anti-protease Halt Protease Inhibitor Single-Use Cocktail (Promega). The protein concentrations were determined by the BCA analysis kit. Protein fractions were used to load an SDS-PAGE gel to perform immunoblotting. The co-IP assay was conducted as previously described with minor modifications49. Briefly, HEK293T cells transfected alone or cotransfected with indicated plasmids or A549 cells infected with IAV were lysed with NP-40 lysis buffer after 36 h. The supernatant was incubated with indicated antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h. Immune complexes were precipitated by incubating Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) for 6 h at 4 °C. After three stringent washes in NP-40 lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting.Ni-NTA pull-down assaysFor Ni-NTA, pull-down assays were done as described67. HEK293T cells cultured in 6-cm plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids. 36 hpt, cells from each plate were collected and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was lysed in lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting to examine the expression of transfected proteins. Another aliquot was lysed in buffer A (6 M guanidine-HCl, 0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mM imidazole, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and subjected to sonication for a total of 30 s. Cell lysates were incubated with 40 μL of pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA beads (QIAGEN) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed 4 times sequentially with buffers A, B (8 M urea, 0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol), and C (same as B except pH 6.3), respectively. Beads with bound proteins were then boiled in an SDS sample buffer with 200 mM imidazole and were subjected to immunoblot.Luciferase assayHEK293T cells were transfected with a mixture of luciferase reporter (IFNβ-Luc, ISRE-Luc, NF-κB-Luc, or STAT1-Luc), pRL-TK (renilla luciferase plasmid), together with indicated plasmids. 30 hpt, the cells were treated with SeV, poly(I:C), IFNβ, or IFNα for another 12 h. The cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity in the lysates was determined with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System. The Renilla luciferase construct pRL-TK was simultaneously transfected as an internal control.Lung tissue histologyThe trachea and lungs from control or virus-infected mice at indicated post-infection times were dissected, fixed in 10% formalin, embedded into paraffin, sectioned, stained with Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) solution, and visualized by light microscopy for histologic changes. The lung histological scores were measured by a pathologist in a blinded manner following a standardized score system as previously described68,69. Three random areas were scored in each lung tissue sample, and the mean value was calculated. The histology score is the median value from five mice. Scores: 0, no damage; 1, mild damage; 2, moderate damage; 3, marked damage; and 4, severe histological changes; an increment of 0.5 was used if the levels of damage fell between two integers. For IHC assays, tissue sections were stained using an anti-influenza virus NP monoclonal antibody. The staining intensity was evaluated as 0, negative; 1, mild, 2, moderate, and 3, strong. Depending on the percentage of positive cells, the proportion score of NP expression was classified as follows: 0, 0%; 1, ≤10%; 2, 11–50%; 3, 51–80%; and 4, ≥81%. The total score was calculated by multiplying the intensity score by the proportion score70.Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software V8.0.1. Data are presented as the mean ± SD unless otherwise indicated. Differences between experimental and control groups were determined by the Student’s t test. For all tests, differences between groups were considered significant when the P-value was >0.05 (ns), <0.05 (*) and <0.01 (**). The Kaplan–Meier method was adopted for animal survival analysis to generate graphs, and the survival curves were analyzed with log-rank analysis.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

During large flu pandemics, when influenza strains evolved substantially, the death toll was even higher.However, the risk of dying from influenza has declined substantially over time due to improved sanitation, healthcare, and vaccination.People born in 1940 had around a third of the risk of dying from influenza as those born in 1900 — even when they reached the same age. This decline continued, and those born in 1980 had a risk of half that of those born in 1940.Influenza still remains a large burden around the world because of an aging population and a lack of access to healthcare and sanitation in many countries.In this article, we look into these developments in detail: how many people die from seasonal influenza and how this has changed over time.We will also look at which factors increase the risk of dying from the flu and understand why, in some years, influenza has led to large pandemics that caused millions of deaths. This knowledge can inform us about the risks of influenza in the future.How many people die from seasonal influenza?Although this is an important question, it is often difficult to answer.Despite being a well-understood disease, it can be hard to count the number of deaths from influenza for several reasons.1One problem is that the symptoms of influenza look similar to other infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus. In many countries, only a fraction of patients with an "influenza-like illness" are tested to confirm whether they were infected by the virus.2 This means we miss many — or, in some countries, most — infections.Another problem is that influenza can lead to death in several indirect ways. It can cause death through respiratory complications such as pneumonia, but also from cardiovascular complications such as heart attacks and strokes or other serious infections. This is especially true for the elderly and people who have chronic health conditions.3 Without accounting for these deaths, we would underestimate the number of flu deaths.To overcome this, researchers estimate the burden of influenza with other methods. They can estimate the number of excess deaths during flu seasons and use routine surveillance data and mortality records to estimate how many of these are caused by the flu.The annual respiratory mortality caused by seasonal influenza was estimated by the Global Pandemic Mortality Project II using data between 2002 and 2011. They estimated that, during this period, seasonal influenza caused between 294,000 and 518,000 respiratory deaths each year globally, with an average of 389,000.4A similar study was conducted by Chaves and colleagues (2023), who estimated flu deaths from cardiovascular disease between 2011 and 2019. They estimated that seasonal flu caused 200,000 to 400,000 cardiovascular deaths globally each year, with an average of 300,000.5On the map, you can see the estimates of flu mortality from respiratory diseases shown as a rate per 100,000 people among people over 65.6In Europe, the rate of deaths from the flu was 30.8 per 100,000 each year among those aged over 65. This is more than three times the risk from traffic accidents, which kill 9 per 100,000 in the same age group.7In low-income countries, these estimates tend to be less certain due to lower levels of testing for influenza and limited mortality records.However, the flu is estimated to be more deadly in countries in South America, Africa, and South Asia than in Europe and North America. For example, Indonesia has more than twice the death rate of Canada. These disparities are at least partly due to poverty, poorer underlying health, and lower access to healthcare. Click to open interactive versionWhat did influenza mortality look like in the past?Death rates from influenza are much lower than they were in the past.We don’t have good long-term estimates of flu deaths across most countries. But, researchers have produced weekly estimates of influenza deaths over long periods in the United States. This allows us to see how modern rates compare to the past. You can see this data in the chart.8Deaths from influenza fluctuate across the year, with large peaks in the winter.9 The total number of deaths from influenza has been roughly stable in the United States over the last 65 years. You can see this in the top panel of the chart.However, a large part of this is due to the fact that the population has been growing and aging.If we look at death rates within age groups, the rate of deaths from influenza has been falling. You can see this in the bottom panel, which accounts for changes in the size and age structure of the population.This means the likelihood that someone dies from influenza at a given age has declined over time. But, because the population is getting larger and older, the total number of deaths has remained stable.Why has influenza mortality declined over time?Influenza mortality has declined over several generations. We know this from historical data from the United States, which has been used to estimate "cohort effects". This tells us whether people born more recently have lower risks of death after accounting for their younger age.Since 1900, there has been a long-term decline in the risk of dying from the flu.10 There are several reasons for this.One is that there were large projects to improve sanitation in cities across the United States in the early 1900s.11 Over the twentieth century, there were also improvements in neonatal healthcare and increases in the rate of childhood vaccinations. All of these factors had benefits that carried forward as people aged: they protected people from developing comorbidities that increased the risk of dying from influenza.There has also been an increase in the rate of flu vaccinations. Influenza vaccines were developed for the first time in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1952, the World Health Organization began a surveillance system to monitor which flu strains were circulating worldwide. This helped researchers develop new vaccines each year that matched those strains.12 Over the following decades, the rate of influenza vaccinations among the elderly began to grow.13The historical decline in influenza mortality has been substantial, as you can see in the chart.Even when they reached the same age, people born in 1940 had around a third of the risk of dying from influenza as those born in 1900. This decline continued, and those born in 1980 had a risk of half that of those born in 1940.14Which factors affect the number of deaths from the flu?Age is a major risk factor for dying from the flu. As you can see in the chart, infants and the elderly tend to have a much higher risk of death from a range of respiratory diseases, including influenza, compared to young adults. For example, 60-year-olds have a ten times greater risk of death from influenza than 20-year-olds.15Once someone reaches their twenties, their mortality risk from the flu increases exponentially. This shape follows the risk of death from all causes.16The risk of dying from influenza also depends on other factors, such as the quality of healthcare, the strain of influenza, and whether the person received the flu vaccine.17Every year, influenza vaccines are reformulated to match the strains of flu that are expected to dominate during the winter. When there is a mismatch between the strains in the vaccine and the flu strains that are circulating, the vaccines tend to have lower efficacy, and flu seasons tend to be more severe.18Why are some flu seasons so severe?Some seasons are far more severe than usual seasonal influenza. This tends to occur when new influenza strains arise and cause influenza pandemics.Over time, influenza viruses circulating in the population tend to mutate through "antigenic drift". This gives them the ability to evade people's immunity.But, influenza viruses can also evolve with large and sudden changes. This happens in a process called “antigenic shift” when parts of different strains combine with each other. These new combinations can be more infectious and more lethal than previous strains, leading to deadlier pandemics.For example, the Spanish flu evolved from a combination of human influenza and another animal influenza, which formed a new H1N1 influenza virus. As you can see in the chart, it caused the largest influenza pandemic in history: research by Spreeuwenberg et al. (2018) suggests that the Spanish flu killed around 17.4 million people. Other estimates are even higher: Johnson and Mueller (2002) suggest that the Spanish flu killed between 50 to 100 million people.19This death toll massively exceeds the number who die from the flu in a typical year — it is between 30 to 340 times higher than the estimate of 700,000 total deaths caused by seasonal influenza each year, even though the global population was much smaller at the time.20Mortality during the Spanish flu rose sharply in young adults compared to previous seasons. Research suggests they lacked immunity to H1 influenza viruses because they had been exposed to different strains in childhood. In contrast, older generations had been exposed to similar H1 influenza viruses decades before the pandemic began, which gave them some protection from the H1N1 pandemic strain.21ConclusionSeasonal flu causes a total of 700,000 deaths from respiratory diseases and cardiovascular diseases each year on average. However, the burden is far lower than in the past due to improvements in sanitation, healthcare, and vaccination.The flu also remains a large burden around the world for two major reasons. One is that many people around the world still lack access to healthcare and have low rates of influenza vaccination, which increases the risk of death.Another reason is that the populations of many countries have been aging rapidly. In lower-income countries, the flu could become a larger burden as they face aging populations in the future.To tackle this risk, the world can take lessons from how the burden has been reduced in the past. One way is to increase the rates of influenza vaccination, as well as other routine vaccinations, which also reduce the risk of severe flu. Another is to improve sanitation and access to healthcare around the world.We've already seen a huge decline in the burden of the flu over many decades, and with greater efforts, we could see that burden decline even further.EndnotesGordon, A., & Reingold, A.

Rates for other age groups can be found here: https://www.nivel.nl/sites/default/files/influenza-nieuwsbrief/GLaMOR%20project_seasonal%20estimates.pdfOther global estimates of seasonal influenza mortality have been made by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Estimates made by GLaMOR were comparable to those by the CDC, while estimates made by IHME were around 4-5 times lower. This may be because the IHME estimated influenza mortality by estimating the number of deaths caused by lower respiratory diseases and then estimating the fraction of those primarily attributed to influenza in vital records, verbal autopsies, and other mortality data. This approach would have missed many deaths caused by complications of influenza and deaths that were not specified on records to be caused by influenza due to limited testing.CDC and GLaMOR's models are also likely to underestimate the total mortality burden from influenza, as they only use data from respiratory-associated deaths. While this would include deaths caused by influenza that had, for example, influenza listed as a secondary cause of death on death certificates, it would miss some that were caused by influenza but attributed to another cause, like cardiovascular disease. Had these models used all-cause mortality to estimate deaths caused by influenza, they would have been more sensitive (captured more deaths caused by influenza) and less specific (captured more deaths caused by other diseases that could not be distinguished easily).In comparison to CDC estimates, GLaMOR used many country-specific indicators in order to extrapolate seasonal influenza mortality to countries that did not provide weekly or monthly influenza mortality records or influenza surveillance data, while the CDC extrapolated this using mainly the WHO Global Health Estimates of respiratory mortality.Cozza, V., Campbell, H., Chang, H.

People also die from other complications of the flu — such as a stroke or heart attack — which are not shown on the map.Eurostat. (2022). Causes of death—Standardised death rate. European Commission. https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/HLTH_CD_ASDR2__custom_3500876/defaultable?lang=enTransport accidents are counted under (V01–V99, Y85) in the ICD-10. Across 27 EU countries, these rates were 9.02, 9.15, and 8.77 per 100,000 people over 65 in 2015, 2016, and 2017 respectively.Estimates of the death rate from influenza are much lower in the ICD-10 since they only consider deaths where influenza is listed as the cause of death on death certificates, while the estimates we show above also include those caused by flu indirectly. This means ICD-10 death rates are likely to be highly underestimated for the flu. However, deaths caused by traffic accidents are more likely to be listed as the primary cause of death on death certificates and are much less underestimated by death certificate data.Acosta, E., Hallman, S.

Demography, 56(5), 1723–1746. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-019-00809-yFrom 1960 to 2015, the number of deaths from influenza was estimated using a Serfling model, which estimates the excess number of deaths during flu seasons using data from the rest of the year and accounting for changes that occur year by year. Since 1997, there has also been routine testing for "influenza-like illnesses" in hospitals to determine the share of them caused by influenza rather than other diseases. Therefore, estimates from 1997 to 2015 were also calculated using a Serfling surveillance model, which accounted for the share of tests that were positive for influenza. This also validates the estimates from the regular Serfling model. In addition, deaths among children aged under 5 are excluded in both models, as they would be likely to include deaths from respiratory syncytial virus.Mortality in the US was slightly lower during the 2009 Swine flu pandemic season than usual flu seasons, as severe disease shifted away from the elderly to young and middle-aged adults. However, the 2009 Swine flu pandemic led to more deaths than regular flu seasons in other countries such as Mexico.Gagnon, A., Acosta, E., Hallman, S., Bourbeau, R., Dillon, L.

But in many tropical countries, flu epidemics coincide with warm rainy seasons, so the trends may have more causes. Other explanations include seasonal changes in human immunity or behavior, such as more indoor mixing and crowding. Petrova, V. N., & Russell, C. A. (2018).

Royal Society Open Science, 9(6), 211498. https://doi.org/10.1098sos.211498In this post, we show the relative risks of death. This is because it's more difficult to give an absolute risk of death from influenza at different ages because mortality rates vary widely over time and between countries, as we saw earlier. Absolute risks depend on how many people are infected during a flu season, the availability of healthcare, the rates of vaccination, and so on. However, the relative risk of death — the ratio between the risk of death in one age group versus another — tends to be more consistent.The shape of this age–mortality curve is often described by the Gompertz function.

Spencer October 19, 2022 UMass Chan Medical School researcher Jennifer Wang, MD, is leading local participation in a study testing a new flu vaccine based on modified RNA, or modRNA. As flu season ramps up, UMass Chan Medical School researcher Jennifer Wang, MD, professor of medicine, is leading local participation in a study to test a new kind of flu vaccine based on modified RNA, or modRNA. The Phase III randomized, observer-blinded, clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of Pfizer’s quadrivalent modRNA influenza vaccine compared with the standard inactivated influenza vaccine in healthy adults 18 years and older. The modRNA vaccine uses the same platform as mRNA vaccines that were developed for COVID-19, Dr. Wang explained. “In the standard vaccine, the proteins are in the vaccine. In the modified RNA vaccine, the code—the RNA—is injected and then your body makes the protein, and that’s the antigen target.” Standard quadrivalent flu vaccines have been available for years, but Wang said while they have made a big difference in preventing serious illness, they’ve only been around 40 percent effective in preventing infection most years. The rapid progress of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines showed there might be promising new approaches. “Standard flu vaccines have made an impact, but we’ve known for years that we could do better, and this is an opportunity. I think this is a really big push forward,” she said. The study at UMass Chan is enrolling participants now, aligned with the campaign to get employees at the Medical School and clinical system vaccinated. Some participants who enroll in the study will get the modRNA flu vaccine and the others will receive the standard vaccine. “Our site is involved with the core of the study,” said Wang. “Whereas some sites will have additional blood draws to look at immunologic responses in different aspects.” Some other sites will roll out their trials in future months to evaluate how the vaccines perform as flu season progresses. Wang said that the possibility of a “twindemic” of influenza and COVID-19 is very real this year because people have had less exposure to flu over the past several years. By now, people’s immune systems have waned against influenza and if they get infected without vaccine protection, they could get very sick. Influenza annually causes 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 to 52,000 deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The influenza virus, which causes the flu, is a major public health issue, infecting millions of people and is estimated to cost $10 billion in direct medical costs in the US annually. Like most viruses, influenza mutates rapidly as it spreads, making it difficult to vaccinate against every possible strain. As a result, every year there is a massive effort to determine which strains will likely be the most prevalent, to make a vaccine that offers the best protection for that season. “It is critical to better understand the fundamental rules that govern the evolution of viruses and how they escape from our immune systems,” said Associate Professor Chris Brooke, from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, US. Researching flu vaccines Most research efforts for influenza vaccination focus on the evolutionary potential of the surface protein haemagglutinin (HA) because this is the main protein the immune system targets. HA binds to receptors on the surface of cells, allowing the influenza virus to enter and replicate. However, another surface protein called neuraminidase (NA) has been largely overlooked. NA is important for later in the virus life cycle, when it destroys the receptors originally used for entry, cleaving the cell and releasing the virions inside. HA and NA are highly functionally involved with each other, despite their opposing actions, because they are both necessary for the virus to infect cells and spread. In a new paper published in Cell Host & Microbe, researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign explored how changes in NA activity affected the evolutionary potential of HA. To do this, they used a wildtype influenza strain and two strains identical to the wildtype except for a mutation that reduced NA activity. Next, the team used a process called deep mutational scanning to create a library of HA mutated versions of their three strains of influenza. The researchers could then measure HA activity and fitness across the mutated virus strains. It is critical to better understand the fundamental rules that govern the evolution of viruses and how they escape from our immune systems” “This is a high-throughput method for introducing every possible amino acid substitution into a given region of interest and then measuring the effects of those substitutions on relative fitness,” said Brooke. “We can then quantify fitness effects of specific substitutions depending on the NA gene they were paired with.” How does HA interact with NA? Through this process, the team determined that virus strains with reduced NA activity had higher mutational tolerance in changes in HA. In other words, when the influenza strains with lower NA receptor binding were paired with mutations that also decreased HA receptor binding, they largely showed no decrease in fitness, compared to the wildtype strain, which often did have decreased fitness. The researchers explained that this is likely due to the opposing functions of HA and NA, where the former works to break into the cell, and the latter works to escape the cell. “If NA has a substitution that decreases its activity, we see compensatory substitutions in HA that lower its relative activity as well, bringing them back into balance. If only one of them goes up or down, the cell becomes out of balance and this decreases the overall fitness. So, you will see a compensatory substitution to bring it back into the optimal range,” explained Brook. “I think we were all surprised to see that,” said Tongyu Liu, a graduate student in Brooke’s lab and lead author on the paper. “The textbook view of mutations is that they are mostly deleterious. But here in our experiment, we demonstrated that the interaction between HA and NA could reshape the fitness effect of mutations, from mostly deleterious to primarily neutral.” LONG READS: Is an HIV vaccine on the horizon? READ HERE The researchers also grew the same strains with reduced NA activity in the presence of neutralising antibodies that target HA to see what mutations would arise. The experiment mimics what happens in the body, when immune cells target and attack the HA protein of influenza cells to clear an infection. By looking at what HA variants are selected to evolve in this environment, the researchers found more evidence that the pathways that HA evolution takes to escape immune pressure are highly contingent on NA function. The evolution of HA is mainly studied in isolation from other genes in influenza vaccine research, but Brooke said this data demonstrates the need to look at the interactions between HA and genes for other proteins, like NA, to predict better how HA will evolve depending on mutations in these other genes across strains. The future of flu vaccine research “Every year we try and pick which of the many different co-circulating flu strains to target with the next year’s vaccine and if we do not pick correctly, that leads to more severe infections and deaths,” Brooke said. “So it is really important to understand the rules that govern the evolution of the virus so that we can better predict the specific pathways it will take.” The researchers now hope that their findings will be used to improve accuracy for predicting future predominant genotypes and create vaccines against these strains.

Daniel Reichert, MD, FAAFP, chair of the Department of Family Medicine, says COVID-19 protocols decreased flu cases, but he anticipates an uptick due to the relaxed precautions in late 2022. The CDC reported that flu was responsible for 12,000 to 52,000 annual deaths between 2010 and 2020. The report notes a dramatic decrease in flu cases during peak COVID-19 mitigation measures. Reichert and other experts equate this effect to proper hand washing techniques, face masks, staying home when sick, deceased proximity to others, and reduced travel, among other factors. With the abandonment of these practices, experts anticipate a flu surge higher than what was reported during the 2020 and 2021 seasons. If the numbers are serious, why don’t more people get the vaccine? As observed by Reichert, individuals often get a common cold or respiratory infection and label it as the flu. “Many get a cold and think, ‘Hey, I had the flu last year, and I was entirely fine. If my body fought it off last year, it could do it again,’” Reichert says. “This is an extremely dangerous mindset to have because we know how contagious and harmful influenza is.” The flu is classified as a highly contagious disease. All individuals can become severely ill upon infection, but no matter their severity, they can pose a risk of infecting high-risk populations. High-risk populations include people ages 65 years and older, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illness, children younger than 5, and especially children younger than 2. “Before the pandemic, patients would visit their primary care doctors for regular check-ups or minor concerns. They’d receive their flu shot while in office because they were already there. To limit exposure, people stopped coming to medical facilities for two years, thus halting their routine and receiving an annual vaccine,” Reichert says. Doctors recommend that all individuals over the age of six months receive a vaccine. Reichert says the vaccine reduces the risk of contracting the virus as well as reduces the risk of serious illness, hospitalization, and death. Does my COVID-19 booster cover influenza? “No, but I highly encourage you to receive both. They are safe to receive together. Just expect a sore arm,” Reichert says. When should I get the influenza vaccine? “Now. We start distributing them as early as September but now is the crucial time to receive them before peak influenza season. You can receive it in the midst and tail end of the season in late winter,” he says. It is difficult for experts to predict how annual vaccines will be against the latest flu strains. Early reports suggest the vaccine is effective against this year’s strain.

Study: Intra-season waning of immunity following the seasonal influenza vaccine in early and late vaccine recipients. Image Credit: Angela_Macario/Shutterstock Studies have reported that inactivated influenza vaccines confer temporary immune protection against influenza infection among HCWs (healthcare workers) with an elevated risk of influenza virus exposure. Immune responses post-influenza vaccinations have been found to reduce intra-seasonally. However, the significance of antibody waning during the season of influenza is not clear. About the study In the present observational prospective cohort study, researchers investigated whether vaccination timing influenced immune protection conferred by influenza vaccinations against infection. The single-center study was conducted between September and November 2021 and comprised 400 HCWs of the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS (national health service) trust, UK (United Kingdom). The participants were vaccinated with QIV (quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine) at two time points before the beginning of the influenza season (between December 2020 and April 2021), i.e., three months prior (early group, n=200) and one month prior (late group, n=200). The vaccines comprised four antigens of the influenza virus, which were: A/Hong Kong/2671/2019 A/H3N2-like, A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019 A/H1N1pdm-like, B/Phuket/3073/2013-like, and B/Washington/02/2019-like. For follow-up assessments, monitoring for ILI (influenza-like illness, elevated body temperature >38°C, and cough) and blood samples were required by the participants. Blood samples obtained were analyzed by HAI (haemagglutinin inhibition assays) performed at four different time points, which were: pre-vaccination, three weeks-post vaccination, February 2021 (influenza season peak), and May 2021 (influenza season end). The seroprotection rates were defined based on the EMEA (European agency for the evaluation of medicinal products) criteria as the proportion of individuals with titers exceeding or equal to 1:40, and those obtained were compared among the two groups at every follow-up visit. Multinomial linear regression modeling was used to evaluate the effects of influenza vaccination timing, sex, age, and previous influenza vaccinations on HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs) at the influenza season peak and season end. Results HAI titers were comparable between the two groups of vaccinees across follow-up time points across all influenza virus strains, except for the influenza A/H1N1pdm strain, for which the titers for the early group of vaccines and the late group of vaccinees at influenza season peak were 76 and 99, respectively. The corresponding season-end titers were 54 and 67, respectively.

The influenza B viral strains rates were >98% across follow-up time points. The multinomial analysis showed that the season-peak and season-end HAI assay titers did not significantly differ among the two groups of vaccinees for IAV strains considering sex, age, and previous influenza vaccinations. In contrast, individuals who were not administered ≥2 influenza vaccinations in the previous four years were associated with lesser HAI GMTs at season-end for the A/H1N1pdm strain (season-peak and season-end adjusted coefficients were -0.7 and -0.8, respectively). Similar findings were noted for individuals who received multiple influenza vaccinations for Victoria/influenza B virus at season peak (adjusted coefficient -0.4). ILI was reported by sixteen individuals during the follow-up period, none of whom were influenza virus-positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive, ten individuals were severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive, one individual was Rhinovirus-positive, and five individuals were not positive for any of the respiratory viruses tested. Irrespective of the timing of influenza vaccinations, HAI GMTs following yearly influenza vaccinations were not likely to differ significantly over the forthcoming flu season. Participants vaccinated immediately before the flu season could swiftly generate antibody responses given that GMTs at the season peak showed no differences compared to the early group vaccinees. Thus, programs of influenza vaccinations must not be halted too early before the flu season commencement to ensure maximal influenza vaccination access for the HCWs. Late vaccine group HCWs showed a greater likelihood toward vaccination reluctance factors, including minor ethnicity and lower age. Thus, early termination of seasonal vaccination programs may reduce the uptake of influenza vaccines for such individuals. Overall, the study finding showed that among healthy adult individuals, flu vaccine-conferred immune protection did not significantly differ by vaccination timing, underpinning influenza vaccine administration over extended periods for maximizing the uptake of influenza vaccines.

Blake would help chase off the geese, as they pose a real threat to domesticated birds, but they would come back at night, Blake said.The virus has killed 99% of the farm's birds and left Emmanuel fighting for his life since Wednesday."I will do anything and go into any amount of debt to save his life," Blake tweeted about her best friend. "My vet came out and was able to sedate and stabilize him until I could find an avian specialist. I have been treating him around the clock since Wednesday."It's "relatively impossible" to vaccinate birds for the virus because there are many mutated versions of it, Blake said.

But one could argue that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had one benefit: It sent influenza viruses (and some others) packing. Global influenza activity was historically low through 2020 and 2021, likely because people wore masks or stayed home. Influenza has only started picking up again this year. So where does that leave us as we head into the 2022-2023 northern hemisphere flu season and what should we expect? The entirely unsatisfactory answer is that no one knows. Predicting the nature of influenza seasons is a global public health challenge. While the World Health Organizations' Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and its more than 150 laboratories around the world -- who incidentally are celebrating their 70th birthday this year -- track and anticipate the evolution of the virus, our ability to predict the magnitude of an upcoming influenza season is poor. The COVID-19 pandemic has made this even more challenging. For starters, one sure bet used to be that we would have an influenza season, but that has not necessarily been the case of late. So, what do we know? Unlike last year's northern hemisphere season, we know that influenza is back. The southern hemisphere flu season, which occurs while those of us in the north enjoy summer, was a mixed bag. But in countries such as Australia and New Zealand, influenza returned with activity at or even above pre-2020 levels. While the magnitude of influenza activity in countries south of the equator doesn't necessarily foretell of similar trends north, the more widespread activity cannot be ignored. The influenza virus' reappearance, combined with the return of international travel, ensures that northern hemisphere countries, except maybe those who still have tightly controlled borders, will have influenza viruses arrive at their doorstep. They probably already have. The CDC website showed during the week ending September 24, 2022, there was a small but steady rise in the number of influenza cases detected nationally. The early rise of case numbers in the U.S. was something experienced by some southern hemisphere countries who recorded very early influenza seasons, some weeks earlier than usual. One factor that likely contributed to this atypical seasonality is a change in population immunity to the influenza virus. Every year, somewhere between 10 to 30% of the population gets exposed to the influenza virus and, in doing so, get a bump in their immunity. We have now gone through a couple of years where, while vaccinations have continued, widespread natural infections haven't. It is again difficult to quantify this lower immunity and conclude what impact it may have, but there is enough evidence to suggest that it could lead to atypical peaks of activity and potentially a more susceptible population. A more susceptible population would equate to more influenza activity. Perhaps the biggest variable that will dictate the upcoming influenza season is the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself. The factors that drove influenza activity to low levels during the past 2 years likely included masking, social distancing, lack of international travel, and school closures, but also direct virus-virus interference with rampant SARS-CoV-2 spread keeping the lid on influenza virus transmission at the population level. There are biologic and immunologic phenomena that might explain why this is the case. Influenza virus activity was starting to pick up in the U.S. in early 2022 when the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant emerged and started rapidly spreading. Once that started, influenza activity dropped off. I, for one, am becoming more inclined to believe we are less likely to see the "twindemic" of rampant COVID-19 and influenza at the same time. One may follow the other, but an overlap in peak activities might be biologically less likely. With several mutations starting to appear in the Omicron variants, and winter conditions such as crowding and other more favorable conditions for transmission coming, we may well experience another COVID-19 wave. If this occurs all bets are off as to what will happen to influenza activity. Coming back to the question at hand, where does that leave us as we head into the 2022-2023 northern hemisphere flu season and what should we expect? There is a considerable amount of gazing into a crystal ball in these following comments. But I do believe we will have an influenza season, one that will be more like pre-pandemic seasons than post-pandemic. There is also a good chance the season will be early. The biggest unknown that could make a mockery of these predictions is SARS-CoV-2. If this virus comes roaring back with another variant and another wave, the crystal ball shatters. I have left the "what can we do?" question until last. The answer is simple: Get vaccinated and encourage your patients to do so too. Make sure they get them both -- influenza and COVID-19 (including all boosters for which they're eligible). We are poor at predicting epidemic magnitude, but as cliched as it is, preparing for the worst and hoping for the best is prudent. Vaccination is central to preparing. Richard J.

Here's how to recognize baby flu symptoms and when to seek treatment. By Nicole Harris Updated on October 19, 2022 Medically reviewed by Antwon Chavis, M.D Close Unfortunately for worried parents, babies aren't immune to influenza. In fact, children under 5 years old—and especially those under 2—are actually more likely to suffer from flu-related complications like pneumonia and dehydration, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Because the flu vaccine isn't recommended for those younger than 6 months old, it's important to recognize flu symptoms in babies and get proper treatment. Here's what you need to know. Baby Flu Symptoms In babies, influenza often resembles a bad cold with a high fever (and occasionally diarrhea or vomiting) that comes on quite suddenly. Babies with the flu are also fussy because they feel so awful, says pediatrician Luke Beno, M.D., with Kaiser Permanente in Atlanta. According to March of Dimes, flu symptoms in babies include: FatigueCoughStuffy or runny noseFever (at least 100 degrees F)Chills or shakesSore throatGastrointestinal issues like vomiting or diarrhea Preventing Flu in Babies Parents should take this respiratory infection seriously. Babies younger than 6 months have the highest risk of being hospitalized, as well as the highest rates of flu mortality. That's largely because their immune system hasn't fully developed and they're too young to have a flu shot. If you were vaccinated during pregnancy, your antibodies cut your baby's flu risk by 41% during those first 6 months, according to research. "A flu shot given during pregnancy has been shown to not only protect the pregnant parent from flu, but also to help protect the baby from flu infection for several months after birth, before he or she is old enough to be vaccinated," says the CDC. All About the Flu Shot for Babies After 6 months, your child will be old enough for their own flu shot. Get the rest of the family and caregivers immunized too, advises Orlando pediatrician Hernando Cardona, M.D., of Windermere Pediatrics. One way your baby might contract the flu is if someone brings it home, he says. The CDC takes the same stance. "As a caregiver to a young child, you should get a flu vaccine, and make sure that other caregivers and all household members aged 6 months and older also get vaccinated each year. By getting vaccinated, you will be less likely to get flu and therefore less likely to spread flu to the child," says the organization. "If the child you care for is 6 months or older, they should get a flu vaccine each year." Also remember to take preventative measures against the flu. For example, wash your hands often, avoid contact with sick or unvaccinated individuals, and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. When to Call the Doctor for Baby Flu Symptoms If your little one spikes a fever, see your doctor that same day. A rapid test of nasal secretions can confirm that they have influenza. Your health care provider might administer an antiviral, such as Tamiflu, which can speed recovery and ward off complications. "When a baby is really sick, we'll give it, because the younger they are, the higher their risk for complications," says Dr. Cardona. One of the most common flu complications is pneumonia, which develops when a flu virus migrates into the lungs from the nose and throat, or when a bacterial infection has cropped up. Viral pneumonia is treated with comfort measures; bacterial pneumonia requires antibiotics. This Is The Best Time for Your Family to Get the Flu Shot Also see your doctor right away if your baby has worrisome symptoms, including: Breathing difficulties Fast breathing High fever (or any fever in babies younger than 12 weeks) Bluish face or lips Chest pain Signs of dehydration Inability to wake Extreme fussiness Ribs pulling in while breathing Seizures Worsening of chronic health conditions Fever or cough that goes away, then returns and worsens Is It Something Else?

However, due to the low pathogenicity of the H11 subvariant and the absence of its widespread transmission among humans, there are only a few reports on the etiology of the H11 subvariant influenza virus. Therefore, in the present study, we isolated a strain of the H11N3 avian influenza virus (AIV) from poultry feces from the live poultry market in the southeast coastal region of China. Considering that the H11 subvariant is known to cause infections in humans and to enrich the knowledge of the H11 subvariant of the avian influenza virus, the genetics, pathogenicity, and transmissibility of the isolate were studied. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the H11N3 isolate was of Eurasian origin and carried genes closely related to duck H7N2 and H4N6. The receptor binding analysis revealed that the H11N3 isolate only acquired a binding affinity for avian-derived receptors. In the respiratory system of mice, the isolate could directly cause infection without adaptation. In addition, the results from transmission experiments and antibody detection in guinea pigs demonstrated that H11N3 influenza viruses can efficiently transmit through the respiratory tract in mammalian models. Direct infection of the H11N3 influenza virus without adaptation in the mouse models and aerosol transmission between guinea pig models confirms its pandemic potential in mammals, underscoring the importance of monitoring rare influenza virus subtypes in future studies. Introduction The avian influenza virus (AIV) is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family isolated from and adapted to an avian host. Influenza A virus has 18 HA subtypes and 11 NA subtypes according to its hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) differences (Spackman, 2014). Waterfowl and birds are the natural reservoirs of avian influenza viruses (Wang et al., 2018). In 1956, the H11 subtype of avian influenza virus was first isolated from domestic ducks in England (Webster et al., 1992). Following that, isolation of this subtype of the virus has been reported in several countries around the world. The H11 subtype of AIV is a low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) covering nine different NA subtypes. Pawar et al. and Koratkar et al. isolated the H11N1 avian influenza virus from the Eurasian spoonbill in India (Koratkar et al., 2014) and from Anas acuta in Japan (Pawar et al., 2010), respectively. Yuee Zhang et al. isolated an H11N2 subtype influenza virus from samples collected from the live poultry market in east China and performed whole-genome sequencing (Zhang et al., 2012). The H11 subtype is most often co-infected with other subtypes of the influenza virus and has not been found to show significant clinical symptoms in infected ducks but has been reported to infect mammals—even humans (Gill et al., 2006). Data from GenBank showed that A/swine/KU/2/2001 (H11N6) was isolated from domestic pigs in Korea, proving that the subtype virus has the potential to infect mammals (Tuong et al., 2020). Antibodies to the H11 subtype virus have been repeatedly detected in the serum of poultry (Kayali et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2021). The continuous spread of this virus could pose a potential threat. The live poultry market (LPM) is a gathering and distributing place for poultry, which is characterized by a large number of poultry species from complex sources, involving long-distance transportation and frequent contact between humans and poultry, which plays a key role in the spread and evolution of AIV (Wei et al., 2019). In the present study, a strain of the H11N3 subtype of AIV was isolated from ducks in a live poultry market in Fujian Province, China. Considering that the H11 subvariants were known to cause human infections, we investigated the viruses in vitro and in vivo (Gill et al., 2006; Kayali et al., 2011). Through whole-genome sequencing, genetic evolution analysis, and mouse infection and transmission experiments of the strain, the genetic evolution status of the virus was clarified, and the infectious risk of the virus to mammals was assessed. This study provides a reference for the comprehensive prevention and control of the H11 subtype. Materials and methods Ethical statement The study was conducted strictly according to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals provided by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of Changchun Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The H5N1 virus experiments were conducted in an animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL-3) laboratory. Virus isolation We collected environmental samples on 14 January 2020 at Xindian Farmers Market, Xiang'an district, Xiamen city. After preliminary screening of the samples by real-time PCR, the influenza A virus was detected in a poultry fecal sample, which was temporarily named EV01. After shaking and centrifugation of the virus-detected sample, the supernatant was harvested and inoculated with 10-day-old SPF chicken embryos, and allantoic fluid was collected after culturing at 37°C for 48 h. The isolated virus was serially passaged three times in 10-day-old SPF chicken embryos, and the allantoic fluid of the chicken embryos was harvested and stored at −80°C. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses TRIzol reagent (TaKaRa) was used to extract total RNA from the allantoic fluid, and a PrimeScriptTM RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa) was used to prepare cDNA using an influenza universal oligonucleotide primer Uni12 (Supplementary Table 1). The obtained cDNA was sent to Shanghai Sangon Bioengineering Co., Ltd. for specific primer PCR of the viral genome, and the resultant PCR product was sequenced. Based on the sequences downloaded from GenBank, we compared the reference sequences of HA and NA genes with the sequences of the strains obtained in this study using the ClustalW method. The GTRGAMMA nucleotide substitution model in PhyML 3.1 software was used, and bootstrap replicates were run 1,000 times to evaluate the maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies of codons of the two gene sequences. Phylogenetic trees were visualized using FigTree v1.4.4. The nucleotide sequences obtained in this study have been submitted to the GenBank database (accession numbers ON968457–ON968464). Identification of receptor binding specificity The receptor binding affinities of the EV01 virus were determined by performing HA assays using 1% desialylated chicken red blood cells (cRBCs; Zhang X. et al., 2021). Specifically, to enzymatically remove sialic acid residues from cRBCs, the cells were treated with 50 mU of vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (VCNA) for 1 h, and then, the cells were resialylated using α-2,6-(N)-sialyltransferase or α-2,3-(N)-sialyltransferase (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 3 h. In addition, an HA assay was performed on VCNA-treated cRBCs, resialylated cRBCs, and normal cRBCs using 4 different erythrocytes to analyze the receptor binding specificity of the virus. A/chicken/Hebei/HB777/2006(HB777[H5N1]) virus isolates from poultry and A/California/04/2009 (CA04[H1N1]) virus isolates from humans were used as controls for preferential binding to avian-type SA α-2,3-Gal and human-type SA α-2,6-Gal, respectively. Growth dynamics in cells A549 and MDCK cells were used to compare EV01 growth kinetics. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 was used to inoculate the virus into two cell monolayers. Infected cells were harvested at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h post-inoculation (h.p.i.) and stored at −80°C, and then, virus titers were determined by median egg infective dose (EID50) assays. Experimental infection of mice Mouse infection experiments were conducted to evaluate the pathogenicity of the virus in a mammalian host. For the experiment, 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. Mice infection experiments were divided into two parts. The first part is weight monitoring, where 10 mice were equally divided into two groups: the infection group and the negative control group. The two groups of mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and were nasally inoculated with 50 μL of PBS buffer and 106 EID50 of the virus. A 14-day continuous weight monitoring program was instituted for all mice of the two groups. The second part of the mice infection experiment was the in vivo monitoring of virus replication. We randomly divided 15 mice into two groups, namely, the infection group and the negative control group, the same as in the first part. Virus infection was conducted based on the protocol described previously (Zhang C. et al., 2021). The mice in the infected group were euthanized at 1, 3, 5, and 7 day(s) post-inoculation (d.p.i.) to measure viral replication. A total of 10 tissue samples, namely, the heart, the liver, the spleen, the lung, the kidney, the brain, the trachea, the pancreas, the intestine, and the turbinate, were collected, and the samples were homogenized in 1 ml of PBS with 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Viral multiplication was determined in each tissue by EID50 assays. Then, we evaluated the clinical symptoms associated with viral infection in mouse models. For histopathological examination, a part of the lung tissue was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 3 d.p.i. Evaluation of transmissibility among guinea pigs For the study of EV01 virus transmission in mammals, nine female guinea pigs of SPF Hartley strain weighing 300–350 g were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. Of the nine guinea pigs, three of them were inoculated intranasally with 106 EID50 of EV01 virus at a volume of 200 μl (100 μl per nostril), which were considered the infection group. All the guinea pigs were transferred to a “tailor-made transmissibility evaluation cage” at 1 d.p.i. To study the direct contact transmission capacity of the virus, three unvaccinated guinea pigs were placed in the same isolator as the three guinea pigs of the infected group. Meanwhile, to monitor the spread of aerosols, three additional unvaccinated guinea pigs were kept in an adjacent isolator (5 cm apart). At 1, 3, 5, and 7 d.p.i., nasal wash samples were harvested using 1 ml PBS with 1% penicillin–streptomycin and titrated in SPF embryonic eggs for EID50 testing. Antibody detection Serum was collected from all guinea pigs in as mentioned previously (Section Evaluation of transmissibility among guinea pigs) at 21 d.p.i., and the HI test was conducted according to the protocol described in the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. A/California/04/2009 (CA04[H1N1]) virus isolates from humans were used as the control group in this study. Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism was used to determine statistically significant differences using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Analyses were performed in triplicate and are representative of three separate experiments. The standard deviation is represented by error bars. Results Phylogenetic analysis We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the genomes of the H11N3 virus using phylogenetic trees generated by PhyML 3.1 and FigTree v1.4.4 to acquire phylogenetic information. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the H11N3 isolate was of Eurasian origin. EV01 virus isolates of HA and NA clustered into clade A/environment/Fujian/S1XA33/2017/H11N3 and clade A/environment/Fujian/02754/2016/H3N3, respectively (Figure 1). PB1, PB2, PA, M, NS, and NP clustered into clade A/chicken/Zhejiang/51048/2015/H1N9, A/duck/Fujian/SE0195/2018/H7N2, A/duck/Fujian/SD061/ 2017/H11N3, A/duck/Fujian/FZHX0004-C/2017/mixed, A/duck/Mongolia/926/2019/H5N3, and A/duck/Zhejiang/ 422/2013/H4N6 (Supplementary Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Figure 1. ML tree of HA and NA of H11N3 virus. The GTRGAMMA nucleotide substitution model in PhyML 3.1 software was used, and bootstrap replicates were run 1,000 times to evaluate the maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies of codon comparison between the two gene sequences. Phylogenetic trees were visualized using FigTree v1.4.4. Black dots indicate the isolate EV01 in this study. Test for receptor-binding property The specificity of receptor binding is an important factor for IAV to cross species barriers. For avian influenza to cross species barriers, a-2,3-linked receptors must switch to a-2,6-linked receptors. HA assays were used to determine the receptor specificity of the EV01 virus, where the poultry-isolated A/chicken/Hebei/HB777/2006(HB777[H5N1]) and human-isolated A/California/04/2009 (CA04[H1N1]) viruses were used as controls for preferential binding. EV01 virus binds more readily to SA a-2,3 receptors according to the receptor binding property studies (Figure 2A, Supplementary Table 2). FIGURE 2 Figure 2.

Analysis of replication kinetics A549 and MDCK cells were used to study the replication kinetics of EV01. The result indicates that the EV01 virus showed a certain proliferation ability in both cells. However, from 24 h.p.i., the proliferation ability of the virus in MDCK cells was significantly higher than that in A549 cells (Figure 2B). Pathogenicity of EV01 virus in mice No noticeable clinical symptoms were observed in infected mice, but the body weight of the mice decreased slightly from 3 d.p.i. and resumed slow growth to 7 d.p.i. All the infected mice survived 14 days (Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 3). Viruses were found in the turbinates, the trachea, the pulmonary tissues, and the heart but not in the liver, the brain, the spleen, the kidney, the pancreas, or the intestines. The highest viral titer was found in the pulmonary tissue at 5 d.p.i., with a value of 103.53 EID50/ml. The viral titer was lower in the trachea, consistent with the receptor-binding property test results in Section Test for receptor-binding property (Figure 3B, Supplementary Table 4). The pathological damage of the mice inoculated with either EV01 or PBS virus was assessed by staining pulmonary tissues with H&E. The pulmonary tissues of the control group inoculated with PBS were normal (Figure 3C), and the pulmonary tissues from the mice inoculated with EV01 virus showed alveolar wall thickening and inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 3D). FIGURE 3 Figure 3. Pathogenicity of EV01 virus in mice. (A) Body weights were monitored daily over 14 days after inoculation.

The histopathological analysis of pulmonary tissues was acquired at ×20 magnification; blue arrows indicate inflammatory cell infiltration, green arrows indicate pus cells, and red arrows indicate alveolar wall thickening. Transmissibility of EV01 virus in guinea pigs The CA04 virus readily infected guinea pigs, as shown in Figure 4A. At 1 d.p.i. with CA04, guinea pigs had a nasal wash titer of 4.95–5.45 lgEID50/ml. In the inoculated guinea pigs, the virus titer peaked at 3 d.p.i. with a titer of 5.95 lgEID50/ml. Detectable nasal wash virus titers were relatively low in contract and exposed animals, peaking at 4.20 and 3.95 lgEID50/ml, respectively. The virus was detected in nasal washes of all groups, indicating efficient horizontal transmission, which is consistent with previous research (Itoh et al., 2009). The seroconversion of all guinea pigs was consistent with virus transmission (Figure 4C). These findings are consistent with those of previous studies, demonstrating the validity of the research method. Figure 4B shows that the EV01 virus can also infect guinea pigs. EV01-inoculated guinea pigs showed a nasal wash titer from 3.45 to 4.20 lgEID50/ml at 1 d.p.i. In the inoculated guinea pigs, the virus titer peaked at 3 d.p.i., with a titer of 4.20 lgEID50/ml. Detectable nasal wash virus titers were relatively low in contract and exposed animals, and the peak value of each group was 1.95 lgEID50/mL. In total, three of the inoculated guinea pigs were positive for the virus, due to direct contact with two pigs, and for virus shedding in one guinea pig. Seroconversion results are identical to virus-shedding test results in both groups (Figure 4D). The results showed that the EV01 virus can be aerosol-transmitted between guinea pigs. In summary, the EV01 virus was efficient in replicating in guinea pigs as well as in transmitting efficiently in contact and exposed guinea pigs. FIGURE 4 Figure 4. Evaluation of the transmissibility of the EV01 virus among guinea pigs. (A) Viral titers of the CA04 group. (B) Viral titers of the EV01 group. (C) Serum detection of each guinea pig in the CA04 group. (D) Serum detection of each guinea pig in the EV01 group. A total of three guinea pigs were inoculated with 200 μl of 106 EID50 viruses (100 μl per nostril). After 24 h, the three naive guinea pigs were placed in the same cage as the infected pigs to see if direct contact transmission occurs, and three other naive guinea pigs were placed in an adjacent cage (with an interval of 5 cm) to observe respiratory droplet transmission. For the detection of virus shedding, nasal washes were collected every other day after inoculation for 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after inoculation. Serum was collected at 21 d.p.i., and the HI test was conducted according to the protocol described in the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. Red, green, and yellow indicate the inoculated group, the contact group, and the aerosol group, respectively. The different shades of color bars in each group indicate individual animals, and the dashed line indicates the lower limit of detection. Discussion Recently, some popular subtypes of the influenza virus (e.g., H9N2 and H5N6) have been confirmed to infect humans, and research on these influenza virus subtypes has also emerged endlessly (Peiris et al., 1999; Schwartz et al., 2019; Li et al., 2022). Researchers in many countries reported the H11 subtype of the avian influenza virus. However, in-depth research on the H11 subtype of the avian influenza virus is rarely reported. Therefore, in the present study, we isolated the avian influenza H11N3 virus from the poultry market environment in the southeast coastal region of China and systematically studied the evolutionary origin, pathogenicity, and transmission ability of the strain. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all eight genes of EV01 belong to the Eurasian lineage. The genes isolated in the current study have high homology with genes of some subtype strains found in Zhejiang, Mongolia, and other places. This study revealed that the H11N3 subtype of the avian influenza virus may undergo different types of recombination in different regions. This may be due to the migration of birds or the spread of the virus via the poultry supply chain. The test for receptor-binding property demonstrated that EV01, like HB777[H5N1] (Zhao et al., 2013), only has α-2,3 receptor binding capacity, indicating a lower risk of cross-species infection. MDCK cells are commonly used to study influenza virus replication because they possess both avian- and human-like receptors. In previous studies, A549 cells also have been proven as a useful cell line to study the infectivity and replication of influenza viruses (Zhu et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2016). As expected, our study found that the EV01 virus showed better proliferative ability in MDCK cells than in A549 cells. These results are consistent with the receptor-binding property. Moreover, in vivo study results are often inconsistent with in vitro study results, which necessitates the development of an ideal mammalian cell model to assess infectivity and replication. Mice and guinea pigs are considered ideal models for AIV adaptation and transmission (Schulman, 1968; Samira et al., 2009; Rodriguez et al., 2017). In our study, EV01 is pathogenic to mice and persists in their lungs for a long time. The results of the guinea pig transmission study and the serological study showed that EV01 has a certain risk of host-to-host transmission, with a direct contact transmission efficiency of 2/3 and aerosol transmission efficiency of 1/3. Based on the aforementioned results, we speculate that H11N3 can cause disease in mammals after adaptation. Strengthening surveillance to prevent cross-species infections and human pandemics and avoiding biosafety risks are recommended. Overall, populations of RNA viruses exhibit large genetic variability; even uncommon low pathogenic influenza viruses have strong epidemic potential in a population. Rare subtypes of the virus should be monitored to prevent them from quietly developing major variants and mammalian pathogenicity due to poor surveillance.

The flu is an infection of the nose, throat, and (sometimes) lungs caused by an influenza virus. (It's not the same illness as gastroenteritis, which is often called a "stomach flu.") Flu infections are most common during "flu season," which lasts from approximately October to May. There are many different influenza viruses, and in any given year some are more prevalent than others.Advertisement | page continues below If your child is near someone with the flu who is coughing or sneezing, they may breathe in infected droplets through their mouth or nose. People with the flu are generally contagious for a day or two before symptoms begin and for five to seven days after. Children may be contagious for longer. Your child can also become infected if they touch something (a toy or a tabletop, for example) that has the virus on it and then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes. The flu virus can live on surfaces for up to two days. Because the flu spreads when people are in close contact, it travels easily through schools, daycares, playgroups, and families. Most people usually get sick one to four days after exposure. The severity of the flu differs from person to person, so it's possible to be infected with the virus and not know it. If you only develop mild symptoms, it's easy to think it's a cold and unknowingly pass the flu virus to others. Is the flu dangerous for babies and young kids? While most children with the flu recover just fine, the illness can be dangerous – even deadly – for babies and small children. Children younger than 5 years are at higher risk of complications than older children and adults. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, about 20,000 children under the age of 5 are hospitalized with flu complications each year. The younger the child, the higher the risk. Children younger than 2 years old are at highest risk for complications, and infants younger than 6 months have the highest hospitalization and death rates from flu. Children with underlying chronic medical conditions (lung, heart, or kidney disease, an immune system condition, cancer, diabetes, some blood diseases, or central nervous system or muscular conditions) are at increased risk for developing complications from the flu. But any child – even those who are otherwise healthy – can develop severe, life-threatening complications.Advertisement | page continues below Complications from the flu include serious illnesses such as pneumonia, as well as dehydration, worsening of long-term health issues (like heart disease or asthma), brain dysfunction, sinus problems, acute myositis (muscle inflammation), and ear infections. Flu symptoms in babies and toddlers During flu season, watch for flu symptoms in your baby or toddler, especially if you know they've been exposed to the virus. Infant and toddler flu symptoms can last a week or more and typically include: Sudden fever, usually above 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) (However, your child can have the flu without a fever.) Chills and body shakes Muscle aches Headache Dry, hacking cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Fatigue Poor appetite Ear pain or a feeling of pressure in the head or face Sometimes vomiting and diarrhea Tiredness Some of these symptoms – such as a headache or body aches – are hard to detect in a baby or young toddler. Since your child may not be able to tell you what hurts, you'll need to pay close attention to how they behave. Do they seem fussier, more uncomfortable, and sicker in general than they might if they just had a cold? If so, get in touch with their doctor.Advertisement | page continues below Does my child have the flu, a cold, or COVID-19? The common cold, COVID-19, and the flu are all respiratory illnesses, but they're caused by different viruses. With all of these circulating, it can be hard to tell what your child has. The flu usually makes kids (and adults) feel much more miserable than a cold does. A baby or young child with a cold typically has: No fever or a low fever (Flu temperatures may run as high as 103 degrees F to 105 degrees F, while a cold rarely produces a fever.) A runny or stuffy nose Only a little coughing Symptoms that come on gradually rather than abruptly Influenza and COVID-19 have similar symptoms (fever, cough, tiredness, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, vomiting, diarrhea), so you can't tell the difference without testing. COVID-19 symptoms may take longer to show up, and the illness may be contagious for a longer time than the flu. It's also possible (though uncommon) to get COVID-19 and the flu at the same time. When should I call my child's provider about the flu? Call the doctor right away if your baby or toddler has any typical flu symptoms. Your child's provider may want to examine them and even test for the flu. Even if you're not sure that your child has the flu, call the doctor if your baby or toddler has any of these symptoms:Advertisement | page continues below A fever of 100.4 degrees F or higher if your baby is younger than 3 months old (A fever in a baby this young may indicate serious infection or disease.) A fever that rises to at least 101 degrees F if your baby is between 3 and 6 months old A fever that rises above 103 degrees if your child is over 6 months old A fever that lasts for more than 24 hours A cough that isn't improving after a week Ear pain A chronic medical condition (such as asthma) that's gotten worse Call 911 if your baby or toddler has any of these symptoms or conditions: Fast or difficult breathing (ribs pulling in with each breath) Bluish or gray skin color Not drinking enough fluids (not peeing as much as usual is a sign of this; see other signs of dehydration) Severe or persistent vomiting Not waking up or not interacting when awake Seizures Fever above 104 degrees F Being so irritable that they don't want to be held Flu-like symptoms that get better but then return with a fever Fever with a rash Other conditions (like heart or lung disease, or asthma) and developing flu symptoms, including a fever or cough Chronic medical conditions that worsen Can I breastfeed my baby if I have the flu? Yes. The flu isn't spread through breast milk. In fact, your breast milk contains antibodies that will help protect your baby from getting the same infection. There are some steps you can take to prevent passing the flu to your baby (see below), but you can continue to nurse them. If someone else is helping care for your baby while you're sick, you could pump your milk and have the caregiver feed your baby. (Wash your hands well with soap and water, and clean the pump according to the manufacturer's directions before pumping.)Advertisement | page continues below Don't worry if you find that your breast milk supply decreases a bit while you're sick. Your milk supply will return to normal when you're feeling better. Get in touch with your provider or a lactation consultant for support if you're concerned. If you're sick with the flu within 2 weeks after birth, your doctor may recommend that you take antiviral medications, because postpartum women are at high risk of flu complications. Flu treatment for babies and toddlers Not all children who come down with the flu will need medicine. But because the flu can be so dangerous for children younger than 2 years old, they're often treated with antiviral drugs. Antivirals work best when started within the first two days of the illness. They can help your child feel better by making symptoms milder, and they can also help prevent serious complications, like pneumonia. The antiviral drug oseltamivir (trade name Tamiflu) is an oral medication approved for treating flu in babies as young as 2 weeks. For children who can't take oral medications, peramivir (Rapivab) is a drug that's given in an IV to children 6 months or older. Guidelines for using antiviral medications change periodically, so check with your baby's provider about current recommendations.Advertisement | page continues below You may wonder if antibiotics will help treat the flu. Antibiotics are only effective against bacteria and a virus causes the flu, so antibiotics won't do a thing. However, antibiotics may be necessary if your child develops a bacterial infection as a result of the flu, such as pneumonia or an ear infection. Are there home remedies to help babies and toddlers with the flu? Whether or not your provider prescribes medication, you can help your child recover from the flu and stay comfortable with these remedies: Hydration: Make sure your child gets lots of fluids. Nurse your baby often if they're breastfeeding, and offer them the bottle as usual if they're bottle-fed. If your child is eating solids, try offering frozen fruit bars and soup or broth in addition to water. If your baby (3 months or older) or toddler is showing any signs of dehydration, their doctor may recommend an electrolyte drink to replenish the water and salts that their body needs. Rest: Keep your child home so that they get plenty of rest (and won't pass the virus to others). Give them plenty of snuggle time, and find quiet activities to keep them entertained. Depending on their age, you might read to them or have them watch a television show or movie. Pain relief: If your child seems uncomfortable, ask their provider whether you can give them a pain reliever, such as children's acetaminophen or (if your baby is 6 months or older and is not dehydrated or vomiting continuously) ibuprofen. Don't give aspirin to a child unless recommended by your doctor. Aspirin can trigger Reye's syndrome, a rare but life-threatening condition. And avoid giving your baby or toddler over-the-counter cough and cold medicine, since they can cause serious side effects. How can I prevent my baby or toddler from getting the flu? Although it's not always possible to prevent your child from getting the flu, there are things you can do to lower their risk. Getting the flu vaccine, practicing good hygiene, and avoiding others who are infected are all important when trying to fight flu germs. Get the flu vaccine If your child is 6 months or older, they can get a flu vaccine. The first time they get one, they'll receive two doses four weeks apart. After that, they'll get one dose each year. The nasal spray vaccine is available for most children 2 years old and older. If your baby is too young for the vaccine, make sure everyone in close contact with them gets vaccinated to limit the chances of exposure.

In most years, the flu peaks between December and February, but outbreaks can happen as early as October. And it takes a couple of weeks for the body to develop antibodies against the influenza virus. Ask your child's doctor when it would be best to vaccinate them. Getting the vaccine is even more important if your child is in a high-risk group – for example, if they have diabetes, a suppressed immune system, severe anemia, a chronic heart or lung condition (including asthma), or kidney disease. Unfortunately, the flu vaccine isn't foolproof. Its effectiveness depends on your child's overall health (it's more effective in healthy children) and how well the vaccine matches the virus that's currently circulating. Different strains of the flu virus circulate each year, and in some years the vaccine is a closer match than in other years. A flu shot is recommended every year. If your child does get the flu after being vaccinated, it's most likely because they were infected by a strain the vaccine didn't cover. And, of course, the shot won't protect them from other viruses that may seem like the flu. That said, the flu vaccine gives your child the best protection available against the flu. And if they do get the flu after being vaccinated, their symptoms will likely be less severe. Practice good hygiene Keep hands clean. Wash your child's hands with soap and warm water, and have everyone in the family wash their hands often, too. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap and water aren't available. Keep germs at bay. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, and then throw the tissue in the trash right away. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Disinfect. Wipe down bathroom and kitchen surfaces and toys frequently with soap and water, or a household disinfectant that's EPA approved for killing bacteria and viruses. Advertisement | page continues below Avoid others who are ill Keep your child away from people who may be sick. If someone in the household is sick, make sure that person stays away from your child as much as possible. If you're sick, you may want to have your partner take care of your child if possible (and vice versa), and consider wearing a face mask when you do interact with your child, to keep from breathing into their face. Let your child's doctor know if they've had close contact with someone who has the flu. Your doctor may want to give your child an antiviral medicine to prevent the illness from developing. No matter how conscientious you are, your child may pick up the virus. If they do get the flu, the good news is that they're less likely to get it again in the same year because they'll be immune to that particular strain. How can I keep my child from spreading the flu to others? While caring for your child, you can also take steps to prevent them from passing on the virus to others: Wash your hands with soap and water after you care for your baby or toddler. Limit your child's contact with others while they're sick. Keep them home from daycare, and steer siblings away when possible. Wash your child's dishes, utensils, and any bottles or sippy cups with hot, soapy water – or run them through the dishwasher – to sanitize them. This will also keep you from reintroducing germs to your baby. Don't let siblings or visitors use any of your child's toys, dishes, and other possessions.

Avian influenza A virus genes, including the three viral polymerase genes, PA, PB1 and PB2, require host-adaptive mutations to allow for viral replication and transmission in humans. Previously, PA from the 2009 pH1N1 viral polymerase was found to harbor host-adaptive mutations leading to enhanced viral polymerase activity. By quantifying translation and mRNA transcription, we found that the 2009 pH1N1 PA, and the associated host-adaptive mutations, led to greater translation efficiency. This was due to enhanced cytosolic accumulation of viral mRNA, which was dependent on the host RNA binding protein GRSF1. Mutations to the GRSF1 binding site in viral mRNA, as well as GRSF1 knockdown, reduced cytosolic accumulation and translation efficiency of viral mRNAs. This study identifies a previously unrecognized mechanism by which host-adaptive mutations in PA regulate viral replication and host adaptation. Importantly, these results provide greater insight into the host adaptation process of IAVs and reveal the importance of GRSF1 in the lifecycle of IAV.

Avian species are the natural reservoir for IAV and avian IAVs represent a major source from which novel IAVs could be introduced to the human population, leading to a new pandemic1,2. However, avian IAVs must obtain host-adapting mutations in their viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRdRp) in order to efficiently replicate and transmit in humans3,4,5. The vRdRp is comprised of three components, PB1, PB2 and PA, bound to viral RNAs which are encapsulated by NP to form viral ribonucleoproteins. Various host-adaptive mutations have been identified in the vRdRp, mainly in PB2 and PA, suggesting that these two components play a key role6,7,8.Especially, the single mutation E627K in PB2 has been shown to significantly increase the activities of avian vRdRps in mammalian cells, leading to greater replication and pathogenicity of avian IAVs9,10,11,12. Recently, the mechanism by which PB2 E627K enhances the activity of avian vRdRps in mammalian cells has been elucidated and comes down to species-specific differences in ANP32 proteins, which facilitate vRdRp dimer formation required for genome replication13,14,15. Most mammalian ANP32A proteins lack a 33 amino acid insertion in the C-terminal low-complexity acidic region which is present in avian ANP32A proteins. Recent structural data has revealed that this 33 amino acid insertion, which is made up of both acidic and basic residues, in chicken ANP32A allows the C-terminal low-complexity acidic region to directly interact with the PB2 627 domain16. However, due to the lack of this 33 amino acid insertion in human ANP32A, the region of human ANP32A which contacts PB2 627 is almost entirely acidic, possibly giving an explanation for the strong selective pressure for a mutation from an acidic residue, glutamic acid (E), to a basic residue, lysine (K), at residue 627 in the PB2 of human adapted vRdRps15.The single PB2 E627K mutation was present in nearly all human IAVs since 1918 until the emergence of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus, which lacked this mutation17,18. The vRdRp of the pH1N1 virus contained an avian-like PA and PB2 and was able to spread globally and cause disease19. Our lab discovered the PB2 mutation T271A had emerged with this pH1N1 virus and was able to activate avian vRdRp, possibly compensating somewhat for the lack of PB2 E627K20. Additionally, the mutation Q591K/R in PB2 has also been shown to play a role21,22. However, we and others found that the avian-like PA contributed the most to vRdRp activity of the pH1N1 virus in mammalian cells6,20,23,24. Previously, we identified PA mutations T85I, G186S and L336M in pH1N1, which enhanced avian IAV vRdRp activity in mammalian cells, as determined by reporter gene assay and mutant viruses23. In addition to these, more mutations in PA have been introduced into pH1N1 during seasonal circulation in the human population, including V100I25. However, the mechanism of how these PA mutations enhance vRdRp activity is not known. It is also unclear if these mutations directly affect the transcription and replication activities of the vRdRp or have alternate functions to enhance viral growth and protein production.IAV is known to utilize several cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) during its life cycle for various functions such as splicing, replication, and selective translation of viral mRNAs26,27,28. Among these RBPs is GRSF1, a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family29. GRSF1 has been shown to directly bind the sequence 10AGGGU14 in the 5' UTR of IAV NP and NS mRNAs to enhance their translation efficiency30,31,32. GRSF1 has also been shown to bind similar sequences in other cellular mRNAs and regulate their translation, as well33,34. RBPs in the hnRNP family are known to regulate translation in a variety of ways, such as via mRNA trafficking, ribosome and translation factor recruitment, mRNA stability, and more35. However, it is not known if GRSF1-dependent selective expression of IAV proteins is a determinant for mammalian host adaptation.Here, we followed up on our previous studies which identified several host-adaptive mutations in the PA from the 2009 pH1N1 virus. By examining the vRdRp activities of 2009 pH1N1 A/California/04/2009 (Cal), 2017 pH1N1 A/Michigan/272/2017 (Mich), and a prototypical avian strain A/chicken/Nanchang/3-120/01 (Nan), we found that mRNA transcripts produced by human adapted IAV vRdRps displayed greater translation efficiency. Specifically, the host-adaptive mutations T85I and G186S, and V100I, within the PA endonuclease domain were found to be involved in the regulation of cytosolic accumulation and translation of viral mRNA. The importance of mutations at residues 85 and 186 was confirmed in recombinant Cal pH1N1 viruses in which mutations to avian virus PA residues reduced viral protein synthesis, cytosolic accumulation of viral mRNAs, polysome association of viral mRNAs, and viral growth in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we found GRSF1 was required for the enhanced cytosolic accumulation and translation efficiency conferred by pH1N1 PA and the host-adaptive mutations T85I and G186S. Together, our results indicate that specific residues in PA affect the translation efficiency of viral mRNA via cytosolic accumulation which is dependent on the host RBP GRSF1.ResultsOrigin of vRdRp components determines the translation efficiency of viral mRNAWe previously found that the PA and PB2 subunits, but not PB1, from Cal independently and cooperatively enhance overall vRdRp activity of avian IAV as determined by reporter gene assays20,23,36. Here, we extended our reporter gene assays and measured both viral transcripts and translated products from the same cell lysates in order to understand the mechanism of enhanced vRdRp activity. Using a luciferase reporter gene, we quantitated both luciferase activity and mRNA production in cells transfected with wild type (WT) or mixed vRdRp cDNAs from the pH1N1 Cal strain and the avian strain Nan. Compared to Nan vRdRp, Cal vRdRp produced 24.2-fold more mRNAs in transfected cells (lane 1 vs 7, Fig. 1a). The Nan vRdRp containing Cal PA or Cal PB2 produced 26.6- or 13.2-fold more mRNAs than Nan vRdRp, confirming that both PA and PB2 genes of Cal enhance transcription activity of Nan polymerase (lanes 1–3, Fig. 1a). However, the enhancement of luciferase activity did not necessarily correlate with the quantity of mRNAs. Lysate of cells expressing Cal vRdRp showed 159.0-fold more luciferase activity compared to the Nan vRdRp (lane 1 vs 7, Fig. 1b). The Nan vRdRp containing Cal PA also showed a significant 257.6-fold increase in luciferase activity. However, Nan vRdRp containing Cal PB2 showed only 35.2-fold increase in luciferase activity (lanes 1–3, Fig. 1b). We calculated the ratios of luciferase activity per mRNA copy number, which we term here as translation efficiency. Comparison of the normalized ratios indicate that mRNA transcripts produced by Cal vRdRp, Nan vRdRp containing Cal PA alone or together with Cal PB2 have significantly greater translation efficiency than those produced by Nan vRdRp (lanes 1, 2, 4 and 7, Fig. 1c). Similarly, Cal vRdRp in which PA was replaced with that of Nan strongly reduced translational efficiency (lane 7 vs 6, Fig. 1c). Cal PB2 also appeared to affect translation efficiency (lanes 1 vs. 3 and 7 vs. 5, Fig. 1c), but this effect was not significant. We confirmed that firefly luciferase activity closely matched protein expression determined by immunoblotting, and there were no major differences in PA expression (Fig. 1d). These results indicate that the origin of PA strongly affects the translation efficiency of viral transcripts.Fig. 1: Origin of vRdRp components determines the translation efficiency of viral mRNA.293 T cells were transfected with the indicated viral polymerase subunits (N = Nan, C = Cal) along with pPolI-NP-luc.

All error bars show means plus/minus the standard deviations (n = 3 biological replicates). One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).Full size imagePA impacts the ability of viral mRNAs to form polysomesTranscripts which are actively translated are associated with multiple ribosomes and form polysomes, allowing for multiple proteins to be rapidly translated from a single mRNA37,38,39,40. Therefore, we examined the association of viral mRNAs with ribosomes by polysome fractionation assay. We analyzed the transcripts produced by Nan vRdRp containing either PA or PB2 from Cal. These polymerase complexes produced similar levels (<2-fold difference) of transcripts, but showed a large difference in translation efficiency (lane 2 vs 3, Fig. 1a and c). Transfected cell lysates were ultracentrifuged through sucrose gradients, fractionated, and mRNAs in each fraction were quantitated by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1e). When the quantity of polysome associated mRNAs were compared, we found that more mRNAs produced by Nan vRdRp with Cal PA were recovered from polysome fractions (fractions 7–12) compared to those produced by Nan vRdRp with Cal PB2 (54.9% and 23.8%, respectively, Fig. 1f). Similarly, 13.4% of the transcripts produced by vRdRp with Cal PA were recovered from the fraction containing 80 S ribosome (fraction 6), while only 5.4% transcripts from vRdRp with Cal PB2 were recovered from this fraction. These results are consistent with the data showing efficient translation of transcripts produced by Nan vRdRp containing Cal PA (Fig. 1c).The observed differences in translation efficiency could be due to the global effect of vRdRp proteins on host translational machinery. To determine this, we quantitated host GAPDH mRNAs in each fraction of the same samples. We found that GAPDH mRNAs efficiently recruit ribosomes and form polysomes, and there was no difference between the cells transfected with the different vRdRp complexes (Fig. 1g).The PA N-terminal region affects the translation efficiency of viral mRNATo determine which region(s) within PA are involved in regulating translation efficiency, we characterized the activities of chimeric PAs containing sequences from Cal and Nan PA (Fig. 2a, b). We expressed these chimeric PA genes together with Nan NP, PB1, PB2 and reporter gene and quantitated luciferase activity and transcripts. When comparing mRNA production, the chimeras containing amino acids 334–463 from Cal PA showed higher transcription activity than those containing the same region from Nan PA (PA-C2; 12.9-fold, PA-C3; 75.9-fold, and PA-C5; 162.2-fold compared to Nan PA, Fig. 2c). These differences were not due to differential expression of the PA chimeras since similar levels of the PAs were detected in transfected cells by immunoblotting (Fig. 2f). For luciferase activity, the chimeras containing the PA N-terminal 333 residues from Cal produced the most activity compared to Nan (PA-C1; 100.0-fold, PA-C4; 173.8-fold and PA-C5; 1,258.9-fold, Fig. 2d). When compared to the mRNA transcript production, the luciferase activity again did not necessarily correlate. The translation efficiency was significantly higher for those produced by vRdRp containing the PA N-terminal 333 residues from Cal compared to Nan (PA-C1, PA-C4, and PA-C5, Fig. 2e). By comparison, the PA chimeras containing the same N-terminal region from Nan PA did not have significantly greater efficiency than that of WT Nan PA (PA-C2 and PA-C3, Fig. 2e). These data indicate that different regions of PA affect the transcription activity and translation efficiency of the transcripts, and that the N-terminal region including the endonuclease domain strongly affects the translation efficiency of viral mRNAs.Fig. 2: The N-terminal region of Cal PA enhances the translation efficiency of viral mRNA.a Diagram showing the chimeric PA constructs.

Previously, we identified two mutations T85I and G186S in the N-terminal region of Cal PA, which are involved in increasing vRdRp activity23. These residues are located within the endonuclease domain of PA, which is associated with cap snatching and initiation of transcription41,42. Additionally, since 2009, the pH1N1 viruses continued to circulate in humans and gained additional mutations, some of which are within the polymerase genes43,44,45. We characterized the polymerase genes of a pH1N1 strain isolated in 2017, A/Michigan/272/2017 (Mich), and found that Mich PA was also able to further enhance the translation efficiency of the Cal vRdRp (Supplementary Fig. 1). Mich contains an additional 6 mutations in PA (residues 100, 224, 321, 330, 362, 438), one of which, V100I, is within the PA endonuclease domain and subsequently was included in our study alongside residues 85 and 186 (Fig. 3a).Fig. 3: PA mutations T85I, V100I and G186S increase the translation efficiency.a Percentages of pH1N1 viruses containing valine or isoleucine at residue 100 in PA from 2009 to 2020.

One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).Full size imageWe next determined the effect of the three mutations within the endonuclease domain, T85I, G186S, and V100I. Nan PA containing each mutation individually or in combinations were tested by reporter gene assay together with the rest of the components from Nan. All mutant PAs were expressed well as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3h). Individual or combined mutations in Nan PA showed no or slight increase of transcription activity (0.9–2.5 fold) compared to WT (Fig. 3b). However, we did detect greater variations in luciferase activity ranging from 0.98–7.4 fold (Fig. 3c). Among the single residue mutations, V100I significantly increased translation efficiency (Fig. 3d). Individual mutations of T85I and G186S did not significantly affect translation efficiency; however, the combination of these two mutations did (Fig. 3d). These results suggest that all three residues contribute to regulating the translation efficiency of mRNAs, and that residues 85I and 186 S likely act cooperatively.We then tested whether mutations to Nan residues at 85 and 186 in Cal PA reduce translation efficiency and if V100I could further increase translation efficiency. Again, all of the mutant PAs were found to be expressed well (Fig. 3i). The individual reversion mutations, I85T and S186G did not significantly reduce transcriptional activity, but the combination of both did by 5.5- fold (Fig. 3e). A similar, albeit more pronounced, trend was observed for luciferase activity where the combination of I85T and S186G caused a 102.3-fold decrease in activity (Fig. 3f). This combined mutant led to a significant decrease in translation efficiency (Fig. 3g). In contrast, the mutation V100I in Cal PA significantly enhanced luciferase activity by 2.7-fold with no significant effect on mRNA transcription. This mutation did lead to a slight, albeit non-significant increase in translation efficiency (Fig. 3f). The data suggest these mutations, most specifically T85I and G186S, obtained by pH1N1 PA contribute to the vRdRp being able to produce viral mRNAs which are efficiently translated within infected cells.Viral mRNAs transcribed by vRdRp containing Nan PA do not accumulate in the cytosolIn order to determine the mechanism by which PA residues in the endonuclease domain enhanced translation efficiency, we considered multiple possibilities. First, the key residues identified are located within the endonuclease domain, which is shared with PA-X. PA-X is a host shutoff protein produced by ribosomal frameshifting and shares the N-terminal 191 residues with PA46,47,48. PA-X suppresses host gene expression by targeting host RNA Pol II transcripts for degradation via its endonuclease domain49. Therefore, it is possible that mutations in the shared domain between PA and PA-X enhance PA-X activity to degrade more host mRNAs and allow viral transcripts better access to ribosomes and translational machinery, resulting in enhanced translation of viral transcripts. We tested the shutoff activity of Nan or Cal PA-X containing the aforementioned mutations and in fact, the opposite was observed (Fig. 4). The presence of the avian-like residues I85T and S186G in Cal PA-X significantly increased shutoff activity while decreasing the translation efficiency (Figs. 4a and 3g). In agreement with this we found that the presence of both T85I and G186S in Nan PA-X significantly reduced shutoff activity while contributing to increased translation efficiency (Figs. 4b and 3d). To further eliminate the possibility that the activity of PA-X plays a role in translation efficiency, we created Nan PA cDNA containing silent mutations at the frameshift site to reduce the expression of PA-X as described previously48. In reporter gene assays using Nan PA frameshift mutants, we still detected differences in translation efficiency, suggesting that PA-X activity is not responsible for the enhanced translation of viral mRNAs (Fig. 4c–e).Fig. 4: Shutoff activity of PA-X does not affect the translation efficiency of viral mRNA.a, b Shutoff activity of Cal and Nan mutant PA-Xs. 293 T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for Cal PA-X a or Nan PA-X b with the indicated mutations along with pCAGGS firefly luciferase.

One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).Full size imageNext, we sought to determine if the cytosolic levels of viral mRNA was affected by the origin of PA. The IAV vRdRp carries out transcription within the host cell nucleus which necessitates the export of viral mRNAs to the cytosol for translation50,51. Cells transfected with WT or mixed vRdRps from Cal or Nan were fractionated into nuclear and cytosolic fractions, and vRdRp transcribed mRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR. Strikingly, we detected major differences in the cytosolic levels of viral mRNA that depended on the origin of the vRdRp (Fig. 5a). Only 2.35% of mRNAs transcribed by Nan vRdRp were detected in the cytosol in contrast to 24.49% of mRNAs transcribed by Cal vRdRp. Importantly, 20.37% of mRNAs produced by Nan vRdRp containing Cal PA were detected in the cytosol and, similarly, the presence of Nan PA in Cal vRdRp reduced the percentage of cytosolic mRNA to 7.12% (Fig. 5a). These results clearly indicate that PA determined the efficiency of mRNA accumulation in the cytosol. These effects were specific to vRdRp transcribed mRNA as the percentage of cytosolic GAPDH mRNA and nuclear U6 snRNA was similar for all conditions (Fig. 5b). Immunoblotting for lamin (nuclear marker) and tubulin (cytosol marker) confirmed the specificity of the fractionation (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, host-adaptive mutations, V100I, and T85I and G186S, in Nan PA enhanced the accumulation of Nan vRdRp transcribed mRNAs in the cytosol (Fig. 5d). This effect was found to be greater in the context of the Cal vRdRp with Nan PA, suggesting that other components of the vRdRp also play a role and may act synergistically with these host-adaptive mutations (Fig. 5e). These results suggest that host-adaptive mutations in PA have a strong influence on the cytosolic accumulation of viral mRNAs, possibly via nuclear export.Fig. 5: PA mutations affect the cytosolic levels of viral mRNA.a–c 293 T cells were transfected with the indicated vRdRp subunits (N = Nan, C = Cal) along with Cal NP and pPolI-NP-luc.

One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).Full size imageGRSF1 binding regulates cytosolic accumulation and translation efficiency of viral mRNAPrevious studies have shown that the host RBP GRSF1 attaches to IAV mRNAs and enhances the translation of viral transcripts as determined in vitro using IAV infected cell lysates30. Specifically, it was shown that GRSF1 binds to a conserved 10AGGGU14 sequence in the 5' UTR of NP and NS IAV mRNAs31. Notably, this GRSF1 binding sequence is not conserved in other IAV mRNAs, such as PB1, where instead the sequence reads 10AGGCA14(Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3). Our pPolI-NP-luc reporter contains the 5' and 3' UTRs from the NP gene of A/WSN/1933(H1N1), which includes the conserved GRSF1 binding sequence. To determine if GRSF1 binds mRNA produced by the vRdRp from pPolI-NP-luc, and if we could abolish this binding by mutating the 10AGGGU14sequence to 10AGGCA14, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 6a). Anti-GRSF1 or IgG rabbit control antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation on lysates from transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and recovered luciferase reporter mRNAs were quantitated by qRT-PCR.Fig. 6: GRSF1 binding regulates cytosolic accumulation and translation efficiency.a A model diagram showing the interaction of GRSF1 with the 10AGGGU14 binding site in the 5' UTR of NP luciferase mRNA. b 293 T cells were transfected with Cal NP and Nan or Cal vRdRp components along with the original pPolI-NP-luc or pPolI-NP-luc CA mutant. Anti-GRSF1 rabbit antibody was used for immunoprecipitation (IP) from whole cell lysates and RNA was extracted from the eluted material. Luciferase mRNAs before and after IP were quantitated by qRT-PCR and percentages of mRNA recovered after IP are shown. c, d 293 T cells were transfected with Cal NP, PB1, PB2, and either Nan PA or Nan PA mutants together with the original pPolI-NP-luc or the pPolI-NP-luc CA mutant c Luciferase mRNA was quantitated by qRT-PCR. d Luciferase activity was determined by the Dual-Luciferase Assay Reporter system. e Ratio of luciferase activity per mRNA, transformed to a normal distribution. f Percentages of cytosolic luciferase mRNA for both templates. Error bars show the means plus/minus standard deviations (n = 3 biological replicates). Two-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).Full size imageWe found that mRNA transcribed by Cal vRdRp was bound by GRSF1 at a higher rate compared to mRNA transcribed by Nan vRdRp, and importantly mutation of the GRSF1 binding sequence to 10AGGCA14 (CA Mutant) significantly decreased the mRNA which was bound by GRSF1 (Fig. 6b). Next, we performed the same experiment utilizing the Cal vRdRp with Nan PA or Nan PA with the indicated mutations to compare the translation efficiencies of the original and CA mutant luciferase mRNAs (Fig. 6c–e). Transcription of the CA mutant luciferase mRNA was not found to be different from the original template (Fig. 6c). However, luciferase production and translation efficiency of CA mutant luciferase mRNA was significantly lower than that observed with the original luciferase mRNAs (Fig. 6d, e). To determine if the CA mutation at the GRSF1 binding site affected the cytosolic levels of vRdRp transcribed mRNA, we performed nuclear/cytosol fractionation and qRT-PCR as described above. Similar to translation efficiency, we found that the percentage of cytosolic vRdRp transcribed mRNA was decreased in all conditions which used the CA mutant reporter gene compared to the original (Fig. 6f). The same results were obtained when mixed vRdRp containing Cal or Nan components were used (Supplementary Fig. 4b–e). It should be noted however, even with the CA mutant GRSF1 binding site, mutations V100I, and T85I and G186S in Nan PA slightly increased the translation efficiency and cytosolic levels of luciferase mRNA in complex with Cal PB1 and PB2 components, suggesting that these mutations may act synergistically with other components of the Cal vRdRp.Knockdown of GRSF1 reduces cytosolic accumulation and translation efficiency of viral mRNATo further confirm the role of GRSF1 in cytosolic accumulation and translation efficiency of IAV mRNAs, we established GRSF1 knockdown (GRSF1 KD) cell lines that stably express shRNA for all isoforms of GRSF1. We confirmed reduced protein and mRNA expression of GRSF1 in two KD cell lines (clones 1–2 and 1–16) (Fig. 7a, b). We also confirmed that the nuclear/cytosolic localization of mRNAs and proteins of representative host genes was not affected by knockdown of GRSF1 in these cell lines (Fig. 7c, d).Fig. 7: GRSF1 knockdown reduces cytosolic accumulation and translation efficiency.a Lysates from WT 293 T or 293 T cells stably expressing shRNA for GRSF1 (clone 1–2 and clone 1–16) were used for immunoblotting to determine GRSF1 and β-actin expression. b GRSF1 mRNA expression from total cell lysates was determined by qRT-PCR using the 2^ΔΔ Ct method. c, d WT 293 T or shRNA GRSF1 clone 1–2 or 1–16 cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytosolic fractions. c Percentages of cytosolic GAPDH mRNA and U6 snRNA are shown. d Representative image of immunoblotting analysis for tubulin (cytosolic marker) and lamin (nuclear marker) detected by specific antibodies. e–h WT 293 T or shRNA GRSF1 clone 1–2 or 1–16 cells were transfected with Cal NP, PB1, PB2, pPolI-NP-luc and Nan PA with the indicated mutations. e Luciferase mRNA was quantified by qRT-PCR. f Luciferase activity was determined by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system. g Ratio of luciferase activity per mRNA, transformed to a normal distribution. h Cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytosolic fractions and mRNA was quantified by qRT-PCR. Percentages of cytosolic luciferase mRNA are shown. Error bars show the means plus/minus standard deviations (n = 3 biological replicates). One-way or Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.Full size imageWe then preformed reporter gene assays in these two GRSF1 KD cell lines with the original pPolI-NP-luc reporter to determine the effect of GRSF1 depletion on translation efficiency and cytosolic levels of vRdRp transcribed mRNAs. Reporter gene assays performed in these GRSF1 KD cell lines utilizing the Cal vRdRp with Nan PA or Nan PA with the indicated host-adaptive mutations showed that transcription was only slightly reduced in one of the GRSF1 KD cell lines (Fig. 7e, Clone 1–2). Importantly, luciferase activity and translation efficiency were significantly reduced in both GRSF1 KD cell lines (Fig. 7f, g). In addition, the quantity of vRdRp transcribed mRNA in the cytosol was significantly reduced in the GRSF1 KD cells compared to that in WT cells (Fig. 7h). Overall, these data further support the idea these host-adaptive mutations in PA are heavily reliant on host GRSF1 for accumulation in the cytosol and translation of vRdRp transcribed mRNAs.PA mutations and GRSF1 regulate viral growth, cytosolic mRNA levels, and protein expressionTo verify the effect of PA mutations on cytosolic accumulation and translation efficiency of viral mRNAs in the context of viral infection, we rescued pH1N1 Cal viruses which contained the avian-like mutations I85T and S186G in combination and a virus containing the mutation V100I. We were unable to rescue recombinant Cal virus with the entire Nan PA gene despite multiple attempts possibly due to significant reduction in polymerase activity (Fig. 1). Using the rescued viruses, we first conducted a multi-step growth curve in human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells. Compared to WT Cal, the PA V100I mutant grew faster and to slightly higher titers, most notably at 6 h post infection (hpi) (Fig. 8a). In contrast, mutations to avian virus residues in PA were severely detrimental to virus growth as demonstrated by the I85T and S186G virus which grew much slower and to lower titers than WT Cal (Fig. 8a).Fig. 8: GRSF1 and adaptive mutations in PA regulate viral growth, cytosolic mRNA levels, and protein expression.a Calu-3 cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 0.01. At indicated times, virus titers in the supernatant were determined. b 293 T cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 3 for 1 h. At 4 hpi, cells were lysed and polysome fractionation was performed. NP mRNA in each fraction was quantified by qRT-PCR and fractions are grouped together as in Fig. 1. c A549 cells were infected with the indicated viruses at MOI of 3. At 4.5 hpi, cells were labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 0.5 h and lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gel is a representative image from 3 biological replicates. Densitometric traces of labeled proteins from 3 biological replicates were quantified by Quantity One software. d–g 293 T WT or 293 T shRNA GRSF1 clone 1–2 or 1–16 were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 5. At 4.5 hpi, cells were lysed and fractionated into nuclear and cytosolic fractions. d, e Total NP or PB1 mRNA as determined by qRT-PCR and standard a curve. f, g Percent cytosolic NP and PB1 mRNAs as determined by qRT-PCR. Error bars show means plus/minus standard deviations (n = 3 biological replicates). Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.Full size imageTo estimate translation efficiency, we determined the association of viral mRNAs with ribosomes in infected cells by polysome fractionation assay. Consistent with the viral growth data, we found greater amounts of NP mRNA associated with heavy polysomes for the WT Cal and V100I viruses compared to the I85T and S186G virus (Fig. 8b). Next, protein synthesis in infected cells was determined by metabolic labeling (Fig. 8c). The results showed that the V100I mutation led to greater synthesis of viral proteins, most notably HA, NP, M1, and NS1, compared to WT Cal. The I85T and S186G virus consistently displayed reductions in viral protein synthesis (Fig. 8c).Lastly, we characterized the effect of GRSF1 KD on viral mRNA during infection. WT and GRSF1 KD cells were infected and total mRNA for NP and PB1 was quantified. Similar to what was seen in reporter gene assays, total NP mRNA transcription was only slightly decreased in one GRSF1 KD cell line (Fig. 8d). Importantly, levels of cytosolic NP mRNAs were significantly reduced in both GRSF1 KD cell lines for the WT and V100I viruses (Fig. 8f). NP mRNAs produced by the virus with avian-like mutations I85T and S186G were not efficiently translocated to the cytosol, even in the presence of GRSF1. These data agree with our reporter gene assays in the GRSF1 KD cells and suggest that, for NP mRNA, residues 85 and 186 are somewhat reliant on GRSF1 for cytosolic accumulation, possibly via nuclear export. In contrast, despite seeing significant reductions in PB1 mRNA in the GRSF1 KD cells (Fig. 8e), the cytosolic levels of PB1 mRNA were largely unaffected by GRSF1 depletion, indicating that GRSF1 is not involved in the cytosolic accumulation of PB1 mRNA (Fig. 8g). Overall, these data demonstrate a link between residues 85 and 186 and host factor GRSF1 in facilitating the efficient cytosolic accumulation and translation of viral mRNAs, which has important consequences for viral fitness.DiscussionIt has been well recognized that vRdRp mutations are necessary for avian IAVs to cross the species barrier and productively infect humans. Many host-adaptive mutations of the vRdRp have been identified, mainly in PA and PB23. However, the underlying mechanisms of how these mutations activate vRdRp activity in mammalian hosts have not been fully elucidated, with the recent exception of PB2 E627K. On the other hand, there exists little mechanistic explanations for how host adaptive mutations in PA regulate vRdRp activity. Mostly, these mutations in PA are located within either the endonuclease domain, which is required for cap-snatching to initiate viral mRNA transcription, or the C-terminal domain, which is involved in the interaction with host RNA polymerase II or vRdRp dimerization52,53,54. Here, we have uncovered a mechanism by which host-adaptive mutations in the endonuclease domain of PA regulate the cytosolic accumulation and translation of viral mRNAs via the host factor GRSF1. By quantifying vRdRp produced transcripts and their subsequently expressed proteins, we have revealed that host-adaptive mutations in PA accelerate viral protein production by enhancing the translation efficiency of transcripts rather than simply increasing their quantity. This appears to affect only a subset specific viral mRNAs which can be bound by the host factor GRSF1. This is a previously unrecognized mechanism of host adaptation by the IAV vRdRp which is independent of transcriptase or replicase activity.Specifically, what we have shown is that viral mRNAs produced by vRdRps containing host-adaptive mutations T85I and G186S in PA were able to efficiently accumulate in the cytosol and be translated into protein. This effect was dependent on the host RBP GRSF1. Knockdown of GRSF1 significantly reduced translation efficiency and the cytosolic accumulation of viral mRNA. It is of note that the major isoform of GRSF1 is predominantly localized to mitochondria where it has been shown to regulate RNA processing and degradation55,56. Therefore, knockdown of GRSF1 expression, as preformed here, could lead to release of RNAs from the mitochondria and triggering of RNA sensors in the cytosol which could inhibit viral protein synthesis. However, mutating the GRSF1 binding site in viral mRNA reduced translation efficiency and cytosolic accumulation of viral mRNA as well, highlighting the role of GRSF1 in IAV mRNA translation.The human GRSF1 gene encodes for an RNA-binding protein within the hnRNP family and there exists at least two major isoforms57. Both known isoforms of GRSF1 share three quasi-RNA recognition motifs (qRRM) and an acid-rich domain, which is considered to play a regulatory role58. The three qRRMs in GRSF1 mediate interactions with guanine rich sequences of RNA, including cellular mRNAs for glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and unusual SNARE of the endoplasmic reticulum (Use1)33,34. GRSF1 binding to GPx4 and Use1 mRNAs positively regulated their translation, although the exact mechanism is not yet clear. However, the guanine rich sequences of RNA which are bound by GRSF1 have the propensity to form G-quadruplex structures which are proposed to regulate RNAs through a variety of mechanisms59. Recently, it has been shown that GRSF1 binding to G-quadruplex structures results in the melting of these RNA secondary structures56. This presents one potential mechanism of GRSF1 enhancement of translation, melting of secondary structure in RNA to increase the rate of translation initiation or ribosome processivity. In support of its role in regulating translation, GRSF1 overexpression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts has been shown to increase the amount of GPx4 mRNA found associated with polysomes34. Additionally, GRSF1 has been shown to interact with miRNA-346, which regulates the translation of hTERT mRNA. Overexpression of miRNA-346 leads to enhanced recruitment of hTERT mRNA to ribosomes, but knockdown of GRSF1 expression abrogates this effect, which suggests a role for GRSF1 in ribosome recruitment via miRNA-34660.Previous studies conducted over two decades ago showed that GRSF1 binds to the 10AGGGU14 sequence in the 5' UTR of the IAV NP and NS mRNAs, and enhances their translation as determined by in vitro assays31,61. Our data here indicated that binding of GRSF1 to IAV mRNAs also increased cytosolic levels of the transcripts. In support of GRSF1 possibly being able to regulate the nuclear export of viral mRNAs, a recent Bio-ID screen identified GRSF1 as an interacting partner of the nuclear export factor Aly/REF62. This is in line with the known functions of other hnRNPs in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling63. Our data here clearly show that loss of GRSF1 binding or knockdown of GRSF1 reduces cytosolic levels of viral mRNA and subsequently leads to a decrease in translation, having major consequences for viral growth and replication. All together, these data suggest that IAV utilizes GRSF1 for selective and rapid expression of viral proteins.There are major differences in the sequences of human and chicken (Gallus gallus) GRSF1 (Supplementary Fig. 5). The three qRRM domains show a high degree of conservation (67%, 60%, and 60% identity) compared to only 43% identity overall for the entire protein. Importantly, the acid-rich regulatory domain only shares 21% identity. This domain is considered to be responsible for functional regulation through interactions with partner proteins64,65. Considering our findings here show that PA host-adaptive mutations T85I and G186S affect cytosolic mRNA levels and translation efficiency, it is reasonable to speculate that PA is involved in recruitment and/or attachment of GRSF1 to viral transcripts in a species-specific manner. Residues 85 and 186 are located within the endonuclease domain of PA, closely positioned to where cap-snatching and transcription of the 5' UTR of viral mRNAs is initiated (Supplementary Fig. 6). While IAV cap-snatching does introduce an additional unique 10–13 nucleotides to the 5' end of each viral mRNA, the high variability observed in these cap-snatched sequences makes it difficult to predict how cap-snatching could affect GRSF1 binding to viral mRNAs66,67. Additionally, NS mRNA is spliced into both NS1 and NS2 and both mRNAs share the 5' UTR which includes the GRSF1 binding sequence. Therefore, it is possible that GRSF1 regulates the cytosolic levels and translation of NS2 mRNA as well.The GRSF1 binding sequence that we investigate here, 10AGGGU14, is highly conserved in the 5' UTRs of mRNAs from the NP and NS genes from both avian and human IAVs, suggesting that both human and avian IAVs utilize GRSF1 (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3). The 5' UTR of HA mRNA from avian and human IAVs contains the sequence 10AGGGG14which is the same consensus binding sequence that GRSF1 was shown to bind in GPx4 mRNA(34) (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3). This also implicates GRSF1 in the regulation of HA mRNA translation. Importantly, the IAV HA, NP and NS1 proteins are the most rapidly and highly expressed proteins during viral infection68. GRSF1 binding to these transcripts provides a potential mechanistic explanation for this. IAV is known to regulate the kinetics and accumulation of viral mRNAs and proteins during the course of infection69. How exactly IAV accomplishes this regulation for all eight different vRNA segments is unclear. However, our data suggest that enhanced translation of NP and NS mRNAs conferred by GRSF1 accelerates virus replication and rapid growth in host cells. NP and NS1 are two highly abundant viral proteins in infected cells and play key roles during early stages of viral infection. Compared to components of the vRdRp, large amounts of NP are required for encapsulating positive and negative sense cRNAs and vRNAs to facilitate replication70. Rapid expression of NS1 is also required during viral infection to effectively impair host anti-viral responses, accelerate viral replication, and selectively enhance the translation of other viral mRNAs71,72. These facts stress the importance of GRSF1 regulation of NP and NS expression to allow for efficient viral replication.Our data reported here strongly suggest that host-adaptive mutations in PA enable GRSF1 to enhance the cytosolic accumulation and translation of a subset of viral mRNAs. This GRSF1 mediated selective expression of viral proteins represents an additional approach for adaptation of IAVs to mammalian hosts.MethodsViruses and cell cultureMDCK (ATCC: CCL-34), 293 T (ATCC: CRL-3216), A549 (ATCC: CRM-CCL-185) and Calu-3 (ATCC: HTB-55) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 8% FB Essence (Seradigm) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Gibco). A/Michigan/272/2017 (H1N1) was acquired from the International Reagent Resource (FR-1615) and propagated in MDCK cells. Recombinant A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) with mutations I85T and S186G or V100I were rescued in 293 T/MDCK cell co-culture and propagated in eggs23,73. Rescued viruses were sequenced for confirmation. Viral infections were carried out in DMEM containing 0.15% bovine serum albumin (DMEM-BSA).PlasmidsNan and Cal PA, PB1, PB2 and NP genes were previously cloned into pCAGGS and pPolI expression vectors by use of specific restriction enzymes20. Mich PA, PB1, PB2 and NP were cloned into pPolI and pCAGGS similarly using RNA from infected cell lysates. The pPolI-NP-Luc construct, which contains firefly luciferase under the control of the human RNA polymerase I promoter, was obtained from T. Wolff (Robert-Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany). Overlapping site-directed mutagenesis was used to mutate the 5' UTR sequence from 10AGGGU14 to 10AGGCA14. Chimeric Nan/Cal PA, and Nan PA T85I, G186S, T85I/G186S mutant cDNAs in pCAGGS vectors were created previously23,36. Cal PA cDNAs with mutations in I85T, V100I, S186G, and I85T/S186G were created by overlapping site-directed mutagenesis. pCAGGS Nan PA Frameshift (FS) was created by overlapping site-directed mutagenesis to remove the frameshifting site by introducing silent mutations. pCAGGS constructs with mutations in Nan PA and Nan PA FS were created by overlapping site-directed mutagenesis or subcloning. pCAGGS Cal PA-X (without tag) was created by cloning the PCR product produced by specific primers from pCAGGS Cal PA-X-flag as a template48. pCAGGS Nan PA-X was created by overlapping site-directed mutagenesis to remove cytosine 598 and then amplifying the coding region for Nan PA-X and cloning into empty pCAGGS48. Mutations were introduced in pCAGGS Cal PA-X and pCAGGS Nan PA-X by subcloning. All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing.Transfection-based reporter gene assaysReporter gene assays were conducted in 293 T cells in 12-well plates. Cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of pCAGGS plasmids containing PA, PB1, PB2 and NP along with 0.1 μg pPolI-NP-luc or pPolI-NP-luc-CA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Gibco) for 24 h at 37 °C. Luciferase activity was measured by the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to manufacturer protocol. For measuring total mRNA, cell lysates were treated with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity was determined with a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo fisher). For RT-PCR reaction, 1 μg of total RNA was digested with DNase I (New England Biolabs) and then purified with TRIzol reagent. 100 ng of purified RNA was used for RT-PCR using RevertAid Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher). Real-time PCR was carried out using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-time PCR system. DNA standards for NP-Luc mRNA, Cal NP mRNA, Cal PB1 mRNA, GAPDH mRNA, and U6 snRNA were generated by PCR. A standard curve from 109 to 101 copies was used for quantification. Primers used for RT-PCR and qPCR were designed to be strand specific for mRNA and validated as described by Kawakami et al.74. For measuring PA-X shutoff activity, 293 T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with 0.4 μg of pCAGGS-FF-Luc and 0.4 μg of pCAGGS PA-X plasmids or empty pCAGGS vector lipofectamine 2000. At 24 h post transfection, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured by the dual-luciferase reporter assay system.Western blotting and reagentsFor immunoblotting, cell lysates were mixed with 4X NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and 5% beta-mercaptoethanol. Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to 0.45 μM PVDF membranes. For detection of protein, primary antibodies used were mouse anti-firefly luciferase (1:1000 dilution, MA1-12556, Invitrogen), mouse-anti PA (1:500 dilution, F5-3275), mouse anti-PB1 (1:500 dilution, F5-1075), mouse anti-beta actin (1:10,000 dilution, 8H10D10, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-Lamin A/C (1:1000 dilution, 2032, Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti α-Tubulin (1:500 dilution, 2144, Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit anti-GRSF1 (1:3000 dilution, A305-136A, Bethyl Laboratories). Secondary antibodies used were rabbit anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked (1:5000 dilution, 7076, Cell Signaling Technology), goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked (1:5000 dilution, 7074 Cell Signaling Technology) and goat anti-mouse IgG1 HRP-linked (1:3000 dilution, ab97240, abcam).Transfection based polyribosome fractionation293 T cells in 100 mm dishes were transfected with 5.3 μg each of pCAGGS plasmids containing PA, PB1, PB2 and NP along with 1.3 μg pPolI-NP-Luc and Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM for 24 h at 37 °C. Polysome fractionation was carried out as described by Panda et al.39. Briefly, at 24 h post transfection, cycloheximide (CHX, Thermo Fisher) was added to cells at a final concentration of 100 μg/mL and incubated for 10 min. Cells were washed three times with ice cold PBS containing 100 μg/mL CHX. Next, 600 μL of high salt lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1x HALT protease inhibitor, 120 units RNAseOUT, and 100 μg/mL CHX) was applied directly to the plate and cell lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. After incubation on ice for 15 min with occasional mixing and vortexing, the lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, and total RNA concentration was determined by a NanoDrop 2000. A total of 300 μg of RNA was loaded on top of a 10–50% linear sucrose gradient prepared in high salt lysis buffer and centrifuged for 90 min at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C using a Beckman Coulter SW 41Ti rotor. Gradients were fractionated using a BR-188 Density Gradient Fractionation System (Brandel) with absorbance measured at 254 nm. Gradients were separated into 12 fractions. RNA in each fraction was extracted by TRIzol and precipitated overnight with isopropanol at −20 °C. RT-PCR was carried out as described above. Analysis of mRNA distribution amongst polysome fractions was determined as described by Panda et al.39.The equation used for determining the relative amount of RNA per fraction is as follows$$100\ast (({2}^{(cTTube1-cTTubeX)})/(sum:cT\,Tube\,1-cT\,Tube\,{X}_{1}through\,{X}_{N})).$$ (1) Nuclear/cytosolic fractionationAt the indicated times cells were briefly treated with trypsin for detachment and were collected by centrifugation at 600 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Fractionation was performed using the Nuclear/Cytosol Fractionation Kit (K266, BioVision) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After fractionation, RNA was isolated by TRIzol Reagent as described above or cell lysates were processed for immunoblotting as described above. RNA was used for qRT-PCR as described above.$$ Percent\,cytosolic\,mRNA\,was\,determined\,as\, \% \,cytosolic\\ =(cytosolic\,mRNA/(nuclear\,mRNA+cytosolic\,mRNA))\ast 100.$$ (2) shRNA GRSF1 knockdown cell linesTo create a stable GRSF1 knockdown cell line, 293 T cells were transfected with pGIPZ lentiviral shRNA vector containing the shRNA targeting sequence ATGTCAACTATATTCAGTC (RHS4430-200225085 Clone Id: V3LHS_634501(ORF)) obtained from Horizon Discovery. After transfection, cells were cultured in the presence of normal cell growth media for 24 h prior to supplementation with increasing concentrations of puromycin. Single cell colonies were selected based on GFP expression and puromycin resistance and further expanded. GRSF1 protein levels were determined by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-GRSF1 (1:3000 dilution, A305-136A, Bethyl Laboratories).RNA Immunoprecipitation293 T cells were transfected in 100 mM dishes as described above for transfection based polysome fractionation assays. At 24 h post transfection, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (A32955, Pierce)). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 x g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Five percent of input lysate was reserved for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR to calculate the input amounts. Then, 2 μg rabbit polyclonal anti-GRSF1 (A305-136A, Bethyl Laboratories) or 2 μg rabbit IgG isotype control (02-6102, Invitrogen) was added to 1 mg lysate and incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 2 h. After 2 h, 0.5 mg Dynabeads Protein G (10003D, Invitrogen) were added to each sample and further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. Protein/RNA complexes were eluted by magnetic separation and re-suspending in either 4X NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and 5% beta-mercaptoethanol or TRIzol Reagent for RNA extraction. qRT-PCR was carried out as above for detection of mRNAs.Viral infectionsFor polyribosome fractionation, 293 T cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 3 for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 0.15% bovine serum albumin (DMEM-BSA). At the indicated times after infection, 100 μg/mL CHX was added to cells and cultured for 10 min. Cell lysate preparation, ultracentrifugation, and fractionation were carried out as above and gradients were separated into 12 fractions. Strand-specific qRT-PCR for Cal NP mRNA was carried out as described above73,74.For monitoring protein synthesis, A549 cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 3 for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM-BSA. At the indicated times, cells were metabolically labeled with 50 μCi [35S]Met-Cys for 30 min in medium lacking methionine and cysteine prior to lysis with RIPA buffer. Radiolabeled lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were exposed to a phosphor screen and visualized using a Bio-Rad personal molecular imager. To compare the sum of intensities of pixels across lanes, volume analysis was performed using Quantity One 1-D analysis software.For monitoring virus growth, Calu-3 cells were infected with the viruses for 1 h at 37 °C at an MOI of 0.01 and cultured with DMEM-BSA supplemented with acetylated trypsin at 2 ug/mL. At the indicated time points, cell supernatants were collected and titrated in MDCK cells76.Sequence analysisInfluenza A virus sequences for A/California/04/2009(H1N1), A/Michigan/272/2017(H1N1), and A/Chicken/Nanchang/3-120/01(H3N2) were from fludb.org and correspond to NCBI:txid641501, NCBI:txid2033552 and NCBI:txid215853. For comparison of residue V100I, protein sequences for PA from 2009 pH1N1-like influenza A viruses (Human Host) were analyzed from publically available sequencing data on fludb.org using the Analyze Sequence Variation (SNP) program. For comparison of protein sequences for Homo sapiens GRSF1 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_002083.4) and Gallus gallus GRSF1 (NCBI Reference Sequence XP_015131904.2), the program Clone Manager (Sci Ed Software) was used. Comparison of the 5' UTR sequences of IAV mRNAs was performed by downloading complete (coding and non-coding) sequences for all 8 gene segments from fludb.org for both human and avian hosts. Sequences were then trimmed to the length of the 5' UTR for each segment, PB2 = 27 nucleotides, PB1 = 23 nucleotides, PA = 23 nucleotides, HA = 32 nucleotides, NP = 45 nucleotides, NA = 19 nucleotides, M = 25 nucleotides, NS = 26 nucleotides, and aligned for LOGO analysis using a custom R script with Biostrings and ggseqlogo.Statistics and reproducibilityA minimum of three biological replicates was performed for each experiment. Error bars shown represent the means plus/minus the standard deviations. Statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism 9.0 software. Comparisons between multiple groups were performed using a 1-way or 2-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test. Comparisons between single groups was performed using a student’s t-test.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

However, directly targeting the LD lipolytic catabolism in virus-infected cells has not been widely investigated. Here, we show the linkage of the LD-associated lipase activation to the breakdown of LDs for the generation of free fatty acids (FFAs) at the late stage of diverse RNA viral infections, which represents a broad-spectrum antiviral target. Dysfunction of membrane transporter systems due to virus-induced cell injury results in intracellular malnutrition at the late stage of infection, thereby making the virus more dependent on the FFAs generated from LD storage for viral morphogenesis and as a source of energy. The replication of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus (IAV), which is suppressed by the treatment with LD-associated lipases inhibitors, is rescued by supplementation with FFAs. The administration of lipase inhibitors, either individually or in a combination with virus-targeting drugs, protects mice from lethal IAV infection and mitigates severe lung lesions in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. Moreover, the lipase inhibitors significantly reduce proinflammatory cytokine levels in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2- and IAV-challenged animals, a cause of a cytokine storm important for the critical infection or mortality of COVID-19 and IAV patients. In conclusion, the results reveal that lipase-mediated intracellular LD lipolysis is commonly exploited to facilitate RNA virus replication and furthermore suggest that pharmacological inhibitors of LD-associated lipases could be used to curb current COVID-19- and future pandemic outbreaks of potentially troublesome RNA virus infection in humans.

However, they have emerged in recent years as highly dynamic, ubiquitous organelles in lipid and energy homeostasis, cell stress and related challenges, immune responses, and antigen cross-presentation.4 Many viruses manipulate host lipid metabolism, LD biogenesis, and lipid- and LD-associated immune responses during viral replication and/or assembly which suggests that targeting host lipid metabolism is a potential strategy for host-directed antiviral therapy.5,6,7 Indeed, the pharmacological inhibition of lipogenic transcription factors and enzymes has been widely demonstrated to protect host cells and experimental animals from various viral infections.8,9,10,11In the context to LD dynamics during viral infection, there are no detailed studies on how accumulated LDs from the early to the middle stages of viral replication are associated with later stages of infection. These studies may provide, in addition to early lipogenesis and LD formation, a possibility that LDs at a late stage could be re-purposed to serve as lipids that serve as building blocks for the biogenesis of viral replication compartments, viral morphogenesis, or as an energy source for viral replication.6,7,8,9,10,11 However, the regulatory mechanism underlying the lipolytic process which leads to LD breakdown during virus infection has not been studied in detail, possibly enabling new targets for the development of host-directed antiviral therapeutic agents against various viruses. Here, we illuminate the fate of accumulated LDs at the late stage of infections caused by various RNA viruses. Moreover, this study suggests that inhibitors of LD-associated lipases provide a promising new target for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies, including SARS-CoV-2 and its variants and IAV.ResultsA common feature of lipase-mediated LD lipolysis in the late stage of replication by diverse RNA virusesTo evaluate the dynamics of LD formation during viral infection, seven different RNA viruses were individually inoculated into permissive cell lines and evaluated over time. SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells showed an increase in LDs and its major components, TAG and cholesterol, up to 18 h post infection (hpi), followed by a decrease in basal levels, as shown by BODIPY staining and lipid content analyses (Fig. 1a, b). We found similar in vitro LD dynamics during the replication of six additional RNA viruses including IAV, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV), bovine species A rotavirus (RVA), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine sapovirus (PSaV) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Moreover, the alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells exhibited a similar pattern of increase and decline in LDs in the lung tissues sampled sequentially from either SARS-CoV-2-challenged Syrian hamsters or IAV-challenged mice (Supplementary Fig. 2). These data indicated that a broad range of RNA viruses, regardless of their genomic structure or the presence/absence of an envelope in the particle, dynamically regulate early LD formation and late breakdown during their life cycle.Fig. 1In vitro and in vivo activation of lipid droplet (LD)-associated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) during SARS-CoV-2 replication. a Representative images (left) and quantification (right) of sequential changes of BODIPY-stained intracellular LDs (green) and SARS-CoV-2 S protein (red) in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 KCDC03 strain at an MOI of 0.1 FFU. b Dynamics of intracellular triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesterol in the cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 FFU. c Representative images (left) and quantification (right) of phosphorylated HSL (pHSL, green) colocalized with the LD surface marker perilipin-3 (PLIN3) (red) of cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 FFU. d Representative western blot.

Scale bars = 50 µmFull size imageLD breakdown is primarily mediated by lipolysis, a process requiring three distinct hydrolases, including adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and monoacylglycerol lipase.12 Interestingly, noticeable increases in phosphorylated HSL (pHSL, S563) colocalized with the LD surface marker perilipin-3 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the expression levels of pHSLs (phosphorylated at both S563 and S660) determined by a western blot analysis were observed from 8 hpi with a peak at 36 hpi (Fig. 1d). Similar results were obtained for the six other target RNA viruses (Supplementary Fig. 3). Lung tissues obtained sequentially from either SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters or IAV-challenged mice also showed significant increases in pHSLs at 4 days post infection (dpi) or six dpi, respectively (Fig. 1e, f and Supplementary Fig. 4a–d). As a consequence of LD lipolysis, intracellular free fatty acid (FFA) and glycerol levels surged at the late stage of viral infections in vivo (Fig. 1g, Supplementary Fig. 4e) and in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 5).Although LD lipolysis could be governed by multiple signaling events during viral infection, the cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway is widely known to be the most critical to lipase-mediated LD lipolysis through phosphorylation of HSL.12 In response to the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV, the level of cAMP and phosphorylated PKA (pPKA) were increased, particularly at the middle stage of infection (Supplementary Fig. 6a–d) with a concomitant peak of pHSL level (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Since the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway activates various molecules,13 we examined whether the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway participates in the phosphorylation of HSL in SARS-CoV-2- and IAV-infected cells. Of note, simultaneous treatment of virus-infected cells with H89, a PKA inhibitor, prevented viral-mediated HSL phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 6e, f). These data suggested that lipase-mediated LD lipolysis in the late stage of viral infection could be triggered by, but not limited to, the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Taken together, our data strongly indicated that the disappearance of LDs in the late stage of RNA viral infection is causally correlated with intracellular lipolysis via LD-associated lipases through activation of cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.12,13In vitro reduction in viral replication and proinflammatory cytokine through lipolysis inhibitionWe next examined the effects of the non-selective lipase inhibitor CAY10499 and the selective ATGL inhibitor atglistatin on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV at different treatment times.14 In parallel to the increase in lipase activity that occurs in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 3a), the antiviral effect of the CAY10499 and atglistatin at 20 µM concentration in SARS-CoV-2- or IAV-infected cells (MOI of 0.01 FFU) were evident as the treatment time point was closer to median virus incubation time (Supplementary Fig. 7). In addition to inhibiting the replication of both viruses (Fig. 2a–d), treatment of SARS-CoV-2- and IAV-infected cells (MOI of 0.1 FFU) with 20 µM CAY10499 and atglistatin at 18 hpi and 12 hpi, respectively, significantly reduced the levels of intracellular FFAs and glycerol compared to vehicle-treated control (Fig. 2e, f). The inhibition of LD lipolysis in the virus-infected cells resulted in the retention of intracellular LDs (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 8a).Fig. 2In vitro reduction in viral replication and proinflammatory cytokines through lipolysis inhibition. a, b Reduction in SARS-CoV-2 genome copy number and infectious progeny production by treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells (MOI = 0.1 FFU) with atglistatin or CAY10499 at 20 µM. c, d Reduction in IAV genome copy number and infectious progeny production by treatment of IAV-infected A549 cells (MOI = 1 FFU) with 20 µM atglistatin or CAY10499 at 20 µM. e, f Inhibition of FFA and glycerol release from LDs by the treatment with 20 µM atglistatin or CAY10499 in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells at an MOI of 0.1 (e) or IAV-infected A549 cells at an MOI of 1 (f). g Retention of LDs (green) with corresponding inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication (red) by the treatment of virus-infected cells (MOI = 0.1 FFU) with 20 µM atglistatin or CAY10499. h Graphical representation of LC-MS data.

Scale bars = 50 µmFull size imageTo examine the role of FFAs in the late stage of virus replication, FFA profiles of mock- and IAV-infected A549 cells were analyzed by a gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Compared to mock-infected cells, IAV-infected A549 cells at 24 hpi showed a significant increase in the most FFAs, including saturated palmitic acid (PA), monounsaturated oleic acid (OA), and polyunsaturated linolelaidic acid (Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis showed that PA and OA increased by IAV infection were significantly decreased by treatment of infected cells with both lipase inhibitors (Fig. 2h). Interestingly, supplementation individually with PA, OA, or polyunsaturated linoleic acid (LA) in the FFA-deprived condition in lipase inhibitor-treated cells resulted in a rescue of replication for both IAV (Fig. 2i, j) and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2k, l), an observation consistent with the previous reports.11,15 Furthermore, siRNA-mediated gene silencing of ATGL and/or HSL markedly suppressed the protein expression levels of hemagglutinin (HA) and M2 (active as an ion channel16), genome replication, and infectious progeny production through inhibition of LD degradation in IAV-infected A549 cells (Fig. 2m–p).Activated proinflammatory cytokines including interferon-α (IFN-α), IFN-β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in response to IAV infection were significantly reduced by treatment with atglistatin and CAY10499 (Supplementary Fig. 8b–m). Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells with atglistatin and CAY10499 in the above conditions resulted in markedly reduced levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 but not IFN-α and IFN-β which was likely due to both the inability of Vero cells to synthesize IFNs and the antagonist role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins against types I and III IFNs (Supplementary Fig. 8b–m).17,18 Taken together, these data suggested that both lipase inhibitors could reduce viral replication and proinflammatory cytokine response through blockade of FFA release from LDs.Inevitable LD lipolysis for FFA generation during the late stage of viral replicationMost viral infections damage infected cells as a result of viral replication and immunopathological effects and, in severe cases, cause cell death mainly by apoptosis and necrosis.19,20 In these compromised settings, transport of nutrients such as glucose through plasma membrane transporters is likely restricted, thereby causing a deficiency of intracellular energy generation. To understand more about the role of LD lipolysis during the late stage of infection with RNA viruses, we first determined cell death dynamics induced by IAV infection. Dual positive cells for the IAV M2 protein and the necroptosis marker, phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL), were visible from 18 hpi and their numbers increased thereafter (Fig. 3a, upper panels). Notably, pMLKL—the major effector—whose accumulation ultimately leads to membrane lysis, was translocated to the inner plasma membrane of IAV-infected cells (Fig. 3a, upper panels).19 Moreover, characteristic necroptotic cells showing both plasma membrane rupture and peripheral translocation of pMLKL increased (Fig. 3a, upper panels). Likely, IAV-positive apoptotic cells were detected from 18 hpi and its number increased (Fig. 3a, lower panels).Fig. 3Dysfunction of cellular glucose transporter systems by virus-induced cell injury, leading to release of FFAs from accumulated lipid droplets for viral palmitoylation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). a Sequential changes of necroptotic-marker (pMLKL) positive (upper panels) and apoptotic-marker (TUNEL) positive (lower panels) A549 cells infected with IAV PR8 strain at an MOI of 1 FFU determined by immunofluorescence assay (using an antibody against necroptotic marker pMLKL) or TUNEL assay. b, c Sequential glucose uptake into Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 KCDC03 strain at an MOI of 0.1 FFU by measurement of fluorescent glucose using a fluorometer and flow cytometry. d, e Sequential glucose uptake into A549 cells infected with IAV PR8 strain at an MOI of 1 FFU by measurement of fluorescent glucose by a fluorometer and flow cytometry. f Uptake of green fluorescent glucose into Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 FFU (upper panels) and A549 cells infected with IAV at an MOI of 1 FFU (lower panels) observed by confocal microscopy. g Graphical representation of inhibitory effects of atglistatin and CAY10499 on intracellular FAO activities in the SARS-CoV-2- and IAV-infected cells at 36 hpi and 24 hpi, respectively. h Representative western blot (left) and quantification (right) of inhibitory effects of atglistatin and CAY10499 on palmitoylation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in virus-infected Vero E6 cells (MOI = 0.1 FFU) at 36 hpi. All data in the graphs are presented as arithmetic means ± SD from three independent experiments. For statistical analysis, a one-way analysis of variance was carried out with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. Scale bars = 30 µmFull size imageWe next quantified sequential changes of a number of cells expressing either necroptotic (pMLKL) or apoptotic (TUNEL) markers using flow cytometry. Quantification of each cell portion showed that both necroptotic and apoptotic-marker-positive cells started to increase simultaneously, but the percentage gradually increased in necroptotic-marker-positive cells, reaching a proportion of 70%:17% (necroptotic vs apoptotic-marker-positive ratio) at 48 hpi in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells and a proportion of 56%:29% (necroptotic vs apoptotic-marker-positive) at 36 hpi in IAV-infected A549 cells (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). Moreover, the above results were confirmed by western blotting results that showed the expression level of pMLKL significantly increased from 18 hpi in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and from 12 hpi in IAV-infected cells, but cleaved caspase 3 accumulated from 24 hpi in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and from 18 hpi in IAV-infected cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). We next checked whether both lipase inhibitors reduce virus-induced cell death. Inhibition of LD lipolysis by treatment with both lipase inhibitors significantly decreased necroptotic (pMLKL) and apoptotic (TUNEL) marker-positive cells (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b) along with the marked reduction in both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV replication (Fig. 2). In contrast, supplementation of FFAs in the condition of FFA deficiency by the treatment with lipase inhibitors showed an increase in necroptotic and apoptotic-marker-positive cells (Supplementary Fig. 10c–f) with increased SARS-CoV-2 and IAV replication (Fig. 2i–l).The above data suggested that both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV may induce dysfunction of cellular machinery, including membrane transporter systems, particularly at the late stage of infection. Therefore, we examined glucose uptake levels in the SARS-CoV-2- or IAV-infected cells at different time points. Interestingly, the increased levels of glucose uptake levels during SARS-CoV-2 and IAV replications decreased substantially at the late stage of viral infection (Fig. 3b–f), suggesting that virus-induced dysfunction of membrane transporter systems, such as the glucose transporter at the late stage of infection, could make the virus more dependent on the FFAs generated from stored LDs by lipolysis. Indeed, infection with both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV significantly increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) activities at the late stage of infection, which was reduced by lipase inhibitors (Fig. 3g). Moreover, infection with IAV increased basal and maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity in a substrate restricted condition, whereas lipase inhibitors suppressed IAV-induced the rate of FAO (Supplementary Fig. 11a), confirming the role of FFAs as an important energy source, particularly at the late stage of virus replication. It is also possible that FFAs contribute to SARS-CoV-2 and IAV replication via the lipidation of viral proteins, since S-palmitoylation or S-fatty-acylation, post-translational protein modifications, are critical for viral membrane fusion, assembly, budding, and virulence.21,22 Notably, palmitoylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and of IAV HA and M2 proteins was significantly inhibited by the treatment of infected cells with atglistatin or CAY10499 (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 11b). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the pharmacological inhibition of lipases blocks LD lipolysis, thereby inhibiting the use of FFAs as the source of viral protein palmitoylation and energy production via oxidative phosphorylation and possibly inhibiting viral replication compartment formation.4,5,6,7Broad-spectrum safety and antiviral activity in vitroWe next carried out to measure in vitro broad-spectrum safety and antiviral effect of lipase inhibitors by measuring half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50), and selectivity index (SI). Notably, atglistatin and CAY10499 suppressed replication of seven target RNA viruses at even low-micromolar concentrations, showing IC50 from 0.82 ± 0.08 µM of atglistatin for IAV to 6.70 ± 0.49 µM of atglistatin for RVA, and 1.54 ± 0.18 µM of CAY10499 for SARS-CoV-2 to 20.85 ± 5.06 µM of CAY10499 for RVA (Fig. 4a–g and Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, these inhibitors showed relatively very low cytotoxicity to seven cell lines originating from humans, monkeys, dogs, and pigs and were used for measuring IC50 of seven target RNA viruses, resulting in a very high SI, for example, 251 and 154 SI of atglistatin against IAV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively (Fig. 4a–g and Supplementary Table 2). We next examined whether treatment with non-cytotoxic concentrations (1–20 µM) of atglistatin and CAY10499 (much lower than the CC50; Supplementary Table 3) at different treatment times (Supplementary Table 4) exerts broad-spectrum antiviral effects on the seven target RNA viruses in vitro. Treatment of target virus-infected cells with atglistatin or CAY10499 just prior to the peak of lipase activity resulted in a greater reduction in viral genome replication and infectious progeny production of all target RNA viruses in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4h, i) relative to virus-infected cells treated with atglistatin or CAY10499 immediately after virus absorption (Supplementary Fig. 12). These data suggested that targeting LD lipolysis shows a therapeutic potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidate.Fig. 4In vitro broad-spectrum safety and antiviral effect of lipase inhibitors. a–g Dose–response curves for half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and half-maximal cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) and selective index (SI) of atglistatin and CAY10499 against seven target RNA viruses.

Cytotoxicity of atglistatin and CAY10499 to each cell line was measured by MTT assay. h, i Effect of atglistatin and CAY10499 on reduction in viral genome copy numbers and viral infectivity titers for seven different RNA viruses in infected cells when treated just prior to the peak of lipase activity.

One-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisonsFull size imageIn vivo antiviral effectsTo evaluate the in vivo toxicity of atglistatin and CAY10499,14 we treated mice and hamsters with intraperitoneal injections at the maximally explored dose of atglistatin (10 mg kg−1 d−1 for mice and 80 mg kg−1 d−1 for hamsters) and CAY10499 (10 mg kg−1 d−1 for mice). As reported previously,23 we found that atglistatin and CAY10499 moved through the blood and then accumulated in the lungs of mice and hamsters (Supplementary Fig. 13) and did not induce any overt signs of toxicity, including loss of body weight (Supplementary Fig. 14). In addition, there were no gross and histopathological changes were observed in the major organs (liver, lung, kidney, heart, and spleen) in atglistatin- or CAY10499-treated mice (0.1, 1, or 10 mg kg−1 d−1 twice daily (Bid) with 12 h interval for 4 consecutive days) (Supplementary Fig. 15) and atglistatin-treated hamsters (20, 40, or 80 mg kg−1 d−1 Bid with 12 h interval for 4.5 consecutive days) (Supplementary Fig. 16) compared to vehicle-treated control groups.We next evaluated the in vivo antiviral effects of the atglistatin and CAY10499. All the IAV-challenged, vehicle-treated mice in the control group died within 9 dpi, whereas the administration of inhibitors to IAV-challenged mice significantly improved survival rates in a dose-dependent manner, with a 63% survival rate after treatment with atglistatin at 5 and 10 mg kg−1 d−1 (Fig. 5a–c). Moreover, the administration of atglistatin at different concentrations to SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamsters improved gross lung lesions in a dose-dependent manner, showing a 72% reduction in lung lesions at 80 mg kg−1 d−1 compared to lesions in the virus-challenged, vehicle-treated control group (Fig. 5d, e). In parallel, the treatment of IAV-challenged mice and SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters with these inhibitors resulted in a significant recovery of body weight and fewer clinical manifestations of disease compared to those of the virus-inoculated, vehicle-treated control groups (Supplementary Fig. 17). Consistent with in vitro data, FFA and glycerol levels were significantly reduced in the lung tissues of virus-challenged and drug-treated animals (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 18a, b), leading to the suppression of viral genome replication and infectious progeny production (Fig. 5g, h and Supplementary Fig. 18c, d). The interruption of virus-induced LD lipolysis resulted in the cytoplasmic retention of LDs (Fig. 5i and Supplementary Fig. 18e) and a remarkable reduction of virus-associated histopathological lung lesions and viral replication (Fig. 5j and Supplementary Fig. 18f). In IAV-challenged mice, moreover, treatment with both lipase inhibitors also reduced blood viral load compared to the mock-treated control groups, consistent with an inhibitory effect on the spread of IAV through viremia (Supplementary Fig. 18g). Interestingly, inhibition of LD lipolysis by treatment of IAV-challenged mice with both lipase inhibitors significantly reduced the levels of activated proinflammatory cytokines including the IFN-α, IFN-β, TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 in the lungs, compared to the vehicle-treated control (Fig. 5k–o and Supplementary Fig. 19). Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters with atglistatin reduced levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 but had no effect on IFN-α and IFN-β production due to the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins as antagonists to types I and III interferons (Fig. 5k–o and Supplementary Fig. 19).18,24 Taken together, our data suggested that lipase inhibitors have in vivo antiviral and anti-inflammatory cytokine effects on the lung lesions of SARS-CoV-2- and IAV-challenged animals via the blockade of virus-induced LD lipolysis.Fig. 5In vivo antiviral and anti-proinflammatory cytokine effects of lipase inhibitors against influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2. a Scheme of chemical administration twice daily for 4 consecutive days after challenge with 103 PFU of mouse-adapted IAV PR8 strain to mice (n = 16). b, c Survival rates (expressed as percentages) of IAV-challenged mice by treatment with either atglistatin (b) or CAY10499 (c). d Scheme of chemical administration twice daily for 4.5 consecutive days after challenge with 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 KCDC03 strain to Syrian hamsters (n = 5). e Reduction in SARS-CoV-2-induced gross lung lesions in hamsters by treatment with atglistatin. f In vivo inhibition of FFA and glycerol release from LDs in lungs sampled from SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters (n = 5) by treatment with atglistatin. g, h Reduction in SARS-CoV-2 genome copy number and infectious progeny production in lungs sampled from SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters (n = 5) by treatment with atglistatin. i Representative images of LDs and virus replication.

Scale bars = 30 µm for panel i and 200 µm for panel jFull size imageAntiviral synergy with oseltamivir or remdesivirWe further evaluated the potential synergistic antiviral effects of ATGL-targeting atglistatin with either IAV neuraminidase-targeting oseltamivir or SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-targeting remdesivir. The treatment of mice with 10 mg kg−1 d−1 atglistatin and 2 mg kg−1 d−1 oseltamivir and the treatment of hamsters with 80 mg kg−1 d−1 atglistatin and 2.5 mg kg−1 d−1 remdesivir, either singly or in combination exhibited no toxicity, including no detectable body weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 20). Notably, combination therapy of 5 mg kg−1 d−1 atglistatin and 2 mg kg−1 d−1 oseltamivir conferred 100% survival in IAV-infected mice (Fig. 6a, b). Furthermore, combination therapy of 40 mg kg−1 d−1 atglistatin and 2.5 mg kg−1 d−1 remdesivir significantly reduced gross lung lesions in hamsters challenged with different strains of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, KCDC03 (A lineage closely related to early original Chinese strains25), KDCA51463 (Alpha lineage in British variants25) and KDCA55905 (Beta lineage in South African variants25) strain-exposed hamsters treated with a combination therapy showed lung lesions reduced by 82%, 67%, and 69%, respectively (Fig. 6c, d). In parallel, experimental animals administered the combination therapy exhibited better recovery of body weight (both IAV and SARS-CoV-2) and resulted in fewer clinical manifestations (IAV) relative to those of the virus-challenged animals administered the same concentration of either atglistatin, oseltamivir, or remdesivir alone (Fig. 6e–i). Our results demonstrated that combination of atglistatin with virus-targeting drugs, oseltamivir or remdesivir, had better in vivo antiviral effects than those of the individual treatments in all cases.Fig. 6Synergistic in vivo antiviral effects by combination therapy. a Scheme of chemical administration of atglistatin and oseltamivir, either individually or in combination, twice daily for 4 consecutive days after challenge with 103 PFU of mouse-adapted IAV PR8 strain to mice (n = 16). b Survival rates (expressed as percentages) of IAV-challenged mice after treatment. c Scheme of chemical administration of atglistatin and remdesivir, either individually or in combination, twice daily for 4.5 consecutive days after challenge with 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 KCDC03 (closely related to early Chines strains), KDCA51463 (Alpha lineage with British variants), and KDCA55905 (Beta lineage with South African variants) to Syrian hamsters (n = 5). d Reduction in gross lung lesions in Syrian hamsters challenged with each strain by combination therapy with atglistatin and remdesivir. e Effect of treatments on the recovery of body weight in each group. f Effect of treatments on the reduction in clinical signs in each group. g–i Effect of combination therapy of atglistatin and remdesivir on the recovery of body weight in Syrian hamsters (n = 5) challenged with SARS-CoV-2 KCDC03 (g), KDCA51463 (h), and KDCA55905 (i).

Moreover, we demonstrated that inhibitors of cellular lipases have broad-spectrum antiviral potential in vitro and in vivo.IAV and SARS-CoV-2 damage infected cells and ultimately kill host cells by apoptosis and necroptosis.16,19,20,26,27 In these bad milieus, transport of nutrients through dysregulated plasma and/or organelle membranes is restricted or ceased. Thus, FFAs stored in cytoplasmic LDs could be used as viral morphogenesis and energy sources at the late stage of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. In fact, our results showed that both apoptotic and necroptotic cells due to either IAV or SARS-CoV-2 infection were high in the late stage of both viral infections when the breakdown of LDs occurred actively in the virus-infected cells. In parallel, significant reductions in cellular glucose uptake were also found at the late stage of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infections, indicating dysfunction of cellular machinery including membrane transporter systems, particularly at the late stage of infection. The release of FFAs from intracellular stored LDs is also likely critical to provide substrates for energy production via FAO in mitochondria and for the palmitoylation of the key SARS-CoV-2 S protein and IAV HA and M2 proteins, which are necessary for the late stages of virus replication and maturation.6,7,8,9,10,11,21,22 Indeed, we demonstrated that blocking LD lipolysis by the treatment with lipase inhibitors significantly reduced FAO and viral protein palmitoylation. Thus, our data suggested that LDs induced and accumulated at the early stage of RNA virus infection are used as the source of energy, viral palmitoylation, and possibly viral replication compartment at the late stage of both viral infections.Our LC-MS data showed that treatment of IAV-infected cells with lipase inhibitors (atglistatin and CAY10499) significantly reduced the levels of two FFAs, PA and OA, compared to their abundance in untreated control groups. Supplementation of saturated PA and unsaturated OA and LA in the condition of FFA deficiency has been reported to restore the replication of not only RNA viruses including not only SARS-CoV-2, IAV, MERS-CoV, and enterovirus but also DNA viruses such as adenovirus.11,15 In agreement with previous studies,11,15 supplementation of FFAs during FFA deficiency by lipase inhibitors was found to rescue the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV. The addition of unsaturated FFAs such as LA and OA at the time of virus inoculation is known to inhibit pathogenic human β-coronaviruses through their binding to FFA binding pocket in the spike protein, which blocks virus entry.28,29,30,31 This is contrast with our results where supplementation of FFAs in the lipase inhibitor-induced FFA deficiency condition during the active virus replication stage resulted in increased virus replication through providing an energy factory and increasing viral morphogenesis.4,5,6,7 In addition, supplementation of FFAs in the above FFA deficiency condition could promote the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV through its feedback inhibition of cytosolic phospholipase A2.31,32,33Proinflammatory cytokines are essential in the host response that inhibits virus replication, but local and systemic hyper-induction, also known as a cytokine storm, is a fetal driving force for critical infection or increased mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and IAV. In fact, this might be more prominent than the direct inhibitory effects on the virus life cycle.34,35,36,37 In addition to in vitro effects, interestingly, SARS-CoV-2- and IAV-induced activation of proinflammatory cytokines in the lung lesions in our study was significantly reduced by the treatment of virus-challenged animals with lipase inhibitors, which coincided with a significant reduction in the level of FFAs. Since cytokine storm could be induced by an FFA-derived eicosanoid storm after induction of an ER stress response directly via the virus itself or indirectly via debris from virus-induced cell death,7,38 our data suggested that blockade of FFA release from virus-induced LDs and/or decrease in the amount of debris from virus-induced cell death after treatment with lipase inhibitors could reduce the eicosanoid storm/cytokine storm pathway. Of note, an inhibitor-induced FFA deprivation was found to decrease viral genome copy number and protein expression of SARS-CoV-2- and IAV in vitro and in vivo through interruption of energy production, viral morphogenesis, and possibly viral replication compartments. Thus, a reduction in the interaction of viral components as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) with pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) could decrease cytokine production.34,35,36,37,38 Taken together, we hypothesize that reduction in FFA release from LD by lipase inhibitors could mitigate the SARS-CoV-2- and IAV-induced cytokine storm through blocking a FFA-driving eicosanoid storm and virus replication-associated interaction of PRRs and PAMP.34,35,36,37,38 In addition, lipase inhibitor-induced reduction in the cytokine levels could be beneficial in reducing critical infection or mortality due to cytokine storming in the virus-challenged experimental animals.34,35,36Interestingly, greater efficacy of atglistatin and CAY10499 was observed when applied to the virus-infected cells just prior to the peak time of lipase activity. Since liquid-liquid phase separation of viroplasms interacted with LDs has been reported to alter the function of various host proteins, it may interfere with the effectiveness of atglistatin and CAY10499 to lipases and their associated proteins on the LDs.39 Virus-induced LDs are known to enhance the early antiviral innate immune response and inhibit viral replication,7,40 suggesting stabilization of LDs by treatment with a lipolysis inhibitor and then blockade of the antiviral response. The potential reasons why atglistatin and CAY10499 are less effective at suppressing various RNA viruses when treated in the early stage of infections may be the result of instability, inactivation or an inability to effectively access the LDs at the critical time remain unclear; however, this is an active area of investigation.Nevertheless, in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters and IAV-infected mice, early administration of lipolysis inhibitors from 1 day post-inoculation resulted in a significant reduction in mortality and alleviation of lung pathology and virus replication. In virus-infected animals, different steps of the virus life cycle should occur in each individual cell infected at different times, rendering that all steps of the viral life cycle simultaneously occur in infected animals. Therefore, the administration of lipolysis inhibitors even from the early infection could block specific steps of the virus life cycle requiring FFAs generated from LDs by lipolysis. It could be supported by notable in vivo findings in this study; significant low levels of FFAs and glycerol and retention of LDs were observed in virus-infected animals after treatment with lipolysis inhibitors compared to vehicle-treated controls. These in vivo data also supported that blocking FFA production from LDs through lipase inhibition limits virus replication and maturation via interrupting both viral protein palmitoylation and energy production and possibly biogenesis of viral replication compartments for viral replication.6,7,8,9,10,11Toxicity is a limiting factor in the therapeutic application of many drugs with known antiviral activity.41,42,43 In this study, the non-selective lipase inhibitors, atglistatin and CAY10499, potently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection at low-micromolar concentrations and showed a relatively high selectivity index in comparison to FDA-approved chemicals,43 suggesting its safety and effectiveness as a therapeutic agent. Moreover, the combination of the lipase inhibitor atglistatin with IAV NA-targeting oseltamivir or SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-targeting remdesivir, even at lower concentrations, effectively protected mice from lethal IAV infection and much improved the therapeutic effects on SARS-CoV-2-induced lung lesions in a hamster model compared to those for the individual drugs.41 Future clinical studies of a single or combined antiviral therapy with LD-associated lipase inhibitors and drugs targeting viral proteins are warranted for the treatment of patients with severe acute viral infections, such as COVID-19.42Materials and methodsCells, viruses, and culture conditionsA549, Caco-2, MARC-145, and HRT-18G cells in DMEM, Vero E6 and LLC-PK cells in EMEM, and MA104 cells in α-MEM, which were all supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin, were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The IAV A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8) strain, three strains of SARS-CoV-2 (KCDC03, KDCA51463, and KDCA55905), BCoV KWD20 strain, PEDV QIAP1401 strain, PRRSV LYM strain, RVA NCDV strain, and PSaV Cowden strain were used in this study.

They were then mock-inoculated with medium only or virus-inoculated with various multiplicities of infection (MOI): MOI of 0.01 or 1 FFU/cell for IAV, and MOI of 0.01 or 0.1 FFU/cell for SARS-CoV-2, BCoV, PEDV, PRRSV, and PSaV. Thereafter, each inoculum was absorbed for 1 h, and the cells were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4). As shown in Supplementary Table 4, further treatments and incubations varied dependent on the virus species used. Cells treated with PKA inhibitor H89 (5 μM or 50 μM concentration) or vehicle-treated immediately after absorption of IAV at an MOI of 1 FFU or SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 FFU were incubated for 24 and 36 h, respectively, and each cell lysate was used for the detection of HSL and pHSL by western blot analysis as described below. Cells treated with lipase inhibitors at the median incubation time of IAV or SARS-CoV-2 as described in the above condition were supplemented with LA, OA, or PA at 100 µM concentration and left incubation for further median incubation time. The cells were used to assess levels of intracellular TAGs, cholesterol, FFAs, glycerol, FAO, proinflammatory cytokines as well as viral genome copy numbers and virus titers as described below and in Supplementary Information.Determination of FFAsThe difference in saturated and unsaturated FFAs between the untreated and the treated cells after infection with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 was determined by GC-FID and LC-MS as previously reported,11 and detailed procedures are described in Supplementary Information.Transfection of siRNAA549 cells grown in 12-well culture plates or 8-well chamber slides with 70 and 80% confluency were transfected with siRNAs against ATGL (1 and 10 nmol) and/or HSL (1 and 10 nmol) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Scientific) as described elsewhere.46 To optimize the efficient knockdown of target proteins, a second transfection into cells was performed 24 h after the first transfection, and the cells were incubated for a further 24 h. As a negative control, scrambled siRNA (10 nmol) was transfected in cells as described above.Glucose uptake assayGlucose uptake into IAV-infected A549 or SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells was evaluated by measurement of the fluorescent glucose analog 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) amino]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-NBDG) from Abcam according to the manufacturer’s method as described in Supplementary Information.Flow cytometryTo determine the proportion of apoptosis marker (TUNEL)-positive and necroptosis marker (pMLKL)-positive cells and to quantify FITC-conjugated glucose in IAV-infected A549 and SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells, flow cytometry assay was performed as described elsewhere,11 and its procedure is described in Supplementary Information.FAO assaysThe difference in the level of fatty acid oxidation and oxidation consumption rates between the untreated and the treated cells after infection with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 was determined as previously reported,47 and detailed procedures are described in Supplementary Information.Ethics statementIn the animal experiments, all procedures were performed in accordance with the institutional animal care and use committees’ requirements at Chonnam National University (CNU IACUC‐YB‐2018‐41) and Korea Research Institute of Bioscience & Biotechnology (KRIBB-AEC-21203, KRIBB-IBC-20210206).

These policies have evolved over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, including after the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, with regional and country-level differences in their ongoing use. The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with changes in respiratory virus infections worldwide, which have differed between virus types. Reductions in respiratory virus infections, including by influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, were most notable at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued in varying degrees through subsequent waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The decreases in community infection burden have resulted in reduced hospitalizations and deaths associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections. Respiratory virus evolution relies on the maintaining of a diverse genetic pool, but evidence of genetic bottlenecking brought on by case reduction during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced genetic diversity of some respiratory viruses, including influenza virus. By describing the differences in these changes between viral species across different geographies over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may better understand the complex factors involved in community co-circulation of respiratory viruses.

Early pandemic public health responses focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), actions that can be taken at the individual, environmental, community and country level to limit the spread of infection, given the significant health care burden of acute COVID-19 and the lack of COVID-19 vaccines or virus-specific therapeutics. NPIs have been the mainstay of pandemic influenza planning guidance issued by the World Health Organization (WHO)2, the Pan-American Health Organization3 and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention4. The goal of near-simultaneous global implementation of NPIs (Table 1) during the COVID-19 pandemic was to slow down the community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, mitigate the burden of disease and the need for health care resources, and allow time to develop vaccines and treatments.Table 1 Community non-pharmaceutical interventions used during the COVID-19 pandemicFull size tableSince 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and public health implementation of NPIs have had broad effects on individuals, communities and governments. Given that NPIs were designed to mitigate respiratory virus transmission, there have been notable disruptions to the typical seasonal circulation patterns of common respiratory virus infections, including by influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The reduction in community respiratory virus activity, in turn, has led to other downstream effects, including an associated decreased prevalence of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae infections (Box 1). These changes to the community prevalence of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses are undoubtedly multifactorial, influenced in part by the collective implementation and ongoing use of NPIs, changes in health behaviours, reductions in travel, virus-specific transmission factors (Supplementary Table 1) and shifts in testing priorities and surveillance systems5,6. Virus–virus interactions, including viral interference, have been hypothesized as a factor explaining some of the changes in the community circulation of respiratory viruses7 (Box 2). Public health responses have varied since the start of the pandemic as COVID-19 vaccinations became available and hospitalizations declined, resulting in a patchwork of community, regional and country-level differences in the ongoing use of NPIs, with corresponding effects on the circulation of respiratory viruses in the community. Documenting and understanding these changes in respiratory virus circulation during the COVID-19 pandemic can inform future public health responses.In this Review, we summarize the epidemiology of common respiratory virus infections and then focus on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 and the use of NPIs in modifying the circulation, clinical burden and evolution of endemic respiratory virus infections.Box 1 Changes in invasive pneumococcal disease during the COVID-19 pandemicIn addition to changes in viral pathogen activity, there have been reported global reductions in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, particularly among children younger than 5 years149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156. S. pneumoniae is a clinically important bacterial pathogen spread by respiratory droplets and can cause significant morbidity and death. Transmission can lead to colonization and a high carriage density157, which can in turn affect the risk of progression to invasive disease, including sepsis, meningitis and lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia158. Colonization of the respiratory tract by S. pneumoniae is influenced by vaccination159,160,161, host immunity162, respiratory microbiota interactions163 and viral co-infections157,163. Specifically, influenza virus and other respiratory virus co-infections have been associated with increased S. pneumoniae carriage density through modifications of the microenvironment and facilitating S. pneumoniae growth in respiratory sites of colonization157,163. Furthermore, influenza virus co-infection has been associated with increased IPD risk164,165,166; however, this synergistic relationship may differ across species of respiratory viruses that cause co-infection with S. pneumoniae157.The decline in IPD during the pandemic is likely multifactorial, owing to factors such as reduction of person-to-person bacterial transmission through face mask mandates and social distancing156, reduction of bacterial burden among children from school closures151,154 and changes in the circulation of viruses other than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which decreased the risk of co-infection153,156. The reduction of influenza virus infection and RSV infection cases mirrored reductions in IPD cases153. Although people with SARS-CoV-2-associated IPD experience severe disease outcomes152, S. pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2 co-infections are uncommon167,168.However, these reductions in IPD cases may not be sustained, as reports have shown increased incidence of IPD where non-pharmaceutical intervention measures were removed169. Furthermore, reduced paediatric vaccination rates during the COVID-19 pandemic170, including S. pneumoniae immunizations, may result in long-term increases in the community burden of IPD171.Box 2 Viral interferenceRespiratory viral infections can involve complex viral pathogen interactions when a host is infected with more than one type of respiratory virus or when a host is sequentially infected with different respiratory viruses. Among the different virus–virus interactions, viral interference is a direct or indirect antagonistic interaction between respiratory viruses that affects one virus’s ability to infect and cause disease in the host. Evidence of such inhibitory interactions was reported during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in Europe, during which preceding regional rhinovirus epidemics were temporally associated with unexplained and abrupt declines of influenza cases172,173. In turn, annual respiratory syncytial virus activity in France was delayed while infections due to pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus became widespread174. These early observations laid the foundation for subsequent studies exploring viral interference. Negative virus interactions have also been reported in other viral pairings175,176, and viral interference involving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is also thought to occur given the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 but relatively few viral co-infections during the COVID-19 pandemic177.Laboratory-based models have demonstrated plausible mechanisms by which viral interference could exist. For instance, infection with one virus stimulates a broad innate immune response and interferon release, which may inhibit subsequent respiratory viral infections65,178. Alternatively, simultaneous respiratory viral infections may lead to antagonistic effects; for example, viruses may compete for resources179, or the presence of one virus may drive the downregulation of cellular receptors that are necessary for viral entry in the host180. These effects can result in inhibition or delay of secondary infections, or the reduction of severe disease risk associated with subsequent infection.Community circulation of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virusesThe community co-circulation of respiratory viruses was common before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Established local, national and global surveillance systems, many of which measured medically attended respiratory virus infection cases, have helped monitor seasonal changes in circulation before the COVID-19 pandemic8,9,10. While influenza viruses and RSV have been prioritized for surveillance, the expanded use of multiplex molecular respiratory virus assays and the increased awareness of the public health burden of respiratory viruses have renewed interest in characterizing the epidemiology of respiratory viruses. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of community-based surveillance as a means to assess the burden of infection11,12,13.Through the Seattle Flu Study (a community surveillance consortium in the Seattle, WA, USA, metropolitan area) community respiratory virus detection was monitored year-round14. With the community spread of SARS-CoV-2, there were associated circulation changes across the tested non-SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogens from March 2020 onwards, coinciding with community implementation of NPIs, including a stay-at-home ordinance implemented at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic15,16 (Fig. 1). Over time, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses varied throughout the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, with changes in the detection of influenza virus, RSV, rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus infections most commonly described. Characterizing these changes during the COVID-19 pandemic may help to shape public health recommendations to mitigate infection, especially in those most vulnerable to severe disease, and help our understanding of the interviral complexities that govern community co-circulation.Fig. 1: Prevalence of community respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2 from the Seattle Flu Study 2019–2022.a | Prevalence of influenza A virus A and influenza B virus (2019–2022). b | Prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other respiratory viruses. Included are respiratory specimens from 2018 epidemiological week 47 to 2022 epidemiological week 30; a total of 154,740 specimens were tested: 957 in 2018, 25,019 in 2019, 64,869 in 2020, 48,458 in 2021 and 15,437 in 2022. Respiratory specimens were tested with use of a custom-arrayed reverse transcription–PCR platform (Thermo Fisher)16.

Since 1952, the WHO has coordinated a global influenza surveillance system through the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, with 124 WHO member states21,22. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducts seasonal influenza surveillance through syndromic surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) in laboratory, outpatient and hospital-based platforms, as well as through monitoring for deaths due to influenza and pneumonia in adult and paediatric populations23. The combined use of these and other systems around the globe has helped to clarify regional and temporal factors that affect the circulation of influenza virus, which are critical to influenza pandemic planning4.Across different regions and hemispheres, there have been reduced cases of influenza since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. While declines in the numbers of influenza cases may be due in part to changes in health care-seeking behaviours and influenza testing practices, specimen positivity rates have also shown an associated decline over this period18. Influenza vaccination coverage rates increased in adults and adolescents at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic24 while influenza vaccine uptake in those younger than 5 years decreased over the same period24. Influenza vaccination campaigns historically have focused on the youngest age groups25,26,27 as children account for a substantial burden of influenza virus infections and are important contributors to influenza virus transmission in the community25,26,27,28,29. However, reductions in influenza virus activity reported by surveillance systems occurred despite evidence of decreased influenza vaccination coverage in children24,30.Infections during the influenza season were reduced across a range of countries in the Northern Hemisphere. Influenza virus activity levels between October 2020 to early 2021 in the USA and Canada showed historically low levels, with US cases at their lowest since influenza surveillance data were first publicly available in 1997 (refs.31,32). Similarly, in Mexico, where bimodal influenza seasons occur, national indicators of influenza virus activity showed a decline of influenza cases after broad NPI implementation began on 23 March 2020 (ref.33). This included decreases in the frequency of ILI (see later), of clinical specimens that tested positive for influenza viruses, and of the numbers of severe influenza cases. In Bangladesh, the 2020–2021 influenza season was delayed and was shorter than prior seasons, with the start of the annual influenza epidemic occurring soon after NPIs were removed34. A modelling study of the timing of NPI implementation on influenza virus activity in China and the USA showed an associated decrease in influenza virus infections at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic19, with influenza virus activity remaining suppressed in China throughout the remainder of 2020 (refs.35,36). Surveillance reports in China from 2020–2021 show increased influenza virus activity relative to the previous year, with regional differences in the onset of peak activity; however, the degree of activity remained lower than in seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic37.Similarly, data from the Southern Hemisphere showed much lower levels of influenza virus activity than in previous seasons during the months that typically mark the beginning of the influenza season18. Influenza surveillance sites in Australia, Chile and South Africa found that the influenza virus per cent positivity of clinical specimens was markedly lower from April to July 2020 compared with data from the 2017–2019 influenza seasons18. In Australia, this pattern of low influenza virus activity continued through to September 2020, despite variation in the implemented NPI strategies across the country6.Global influenza virus activity remained low during the 2021–2022 influenza season, with low influenza virus numbers (as well as of most viruses) detected overall in northern temperate zone countries and countries in the tropics and subtropics38. However, there was a relative increase in influenza virus activity, particularly in temperate zone countries, compared with the 2020–2021 influenza season38. In China, influenza B virus predominated during the 2021–2022 influenza season, while other Asian countries reported cases of both influenza A virus and influenza B virus38.How influenza virus activity will change over the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown, especially with the variable lifting of travel restrictions, changes in NPI implementation policies, return to in-person learning, behavioural changes (such as variable compliance with masking), waning population immunity to influenza viruses, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants, the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 and challenges associated with influenza vaccine strain selection with low levels of circulating virus39.Community circulation is thought to be driven in part by household transmission of influenza viruses40, with school-aged children playing a significant role in these infections41. However, despite the reopening of schools in some communities, early surveillance data during the 2021–2022 influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere indicated a return of only sporadic cases of influenza virus infections but not the same degree of activity observed before the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada42 and the USA8. These examples show that personal-level NPIs, such as social distancing or face mask use, are associated with low influenza virus community circulation.But even in communities where virus circulation is low, influenza outbreaks may still occur. An influenza A(H3N2) outbreak on a US university campus highlighted the effect of an abrupt return of community influenza virus circulation43. Data from the Seattle Flu Study identified a spike in influenza A(H3N2) virus prevalence in the spring of 2022, coinciding with the easing of pandemic NPIs16. This occurred at a time typically associated with the end of the traditional annual influenza season.Moreover, several countries in the Southern Hemisphere reported influenza virus activity that was different from that in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period. In Brazil, an unusual interseasonal influenza A(H3N2) epidemic occurred between October and November 2021 (ref.44), while in Argentina influenza virus activity was increased in 2022, as reported in epidemiological week 17 (ref.45). In June 2022, Australia experienced an early epidemic surge of seasonal influenza virus activity that peaked in May and June, with higher numbers of reported cases than during the three influenza seasons before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (ref.46). It is unclear whether this is a reflection of the removal of COVID-19 pandemic NPIs or whether it was related to factors specific to that region.RSV circulation during the COVID-19 pandemicWith COVID-19 NPIs in place, case counts decreased significantly across geographic regions and climate zones31,32,47,48,49,50. The effect of stay-at-home orders during the early pandemic decreased non-household social interactions, thereby reducing viral introductions and secondary household transmission. Because RSV is often transmitted through close contact in a childcare facility or school, the effect of these stay-at-home orders was likely to have had a more pronounced effect on the spread of RSV in paediatric populations, as well as onward transmission to groups at increased risk of infection, such as infants and adults aged 65 and older.In Tokyo, where RSV outbreaks occur in summer and autumn months, no RSV outbreaks were observed in 2020 (ref.51). However, in 2021, the Tokyo metropolitan area had the largest increase in RSV cases since RSV surveillance was established in 2003 (ref.51). The rapid resurgence of RSV infections was thought to be due in part to the reduced population-level immunity as well as children’s re-engagement in social activities51.Interseasonal RSV circulation has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, with uncharacteristic peaks during times of the year not typical of RSV seasonality51. In Australia and South Africa, where seasonal peaks generally occur during the winter, peaks of RSV cases were noted in the spring and summer of 2020, coinciding with the implementation and subsequent easing of community NPIs48,52,53. US cases of RSV infection decreased rapidly after NPI implementation and remained at historical low levels into early 2021 (ref.54). However, RSV activity peaked in the USA during the spring and summer months of 2021, with variations by geographic region likely attributed to differences in implementation of community NPIs by states55.Rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus circulation during the COVID-19 pandemicThe case counts of rhinoviruses and respiratory enteroviruses decreased at the start of the pandemic. However, unlike for most of the other endemic respiratory viruses, the prevalence of rhinoviruses and respiratory enteroviruses quickly rebounded and persisted despite ongoing community NPI implementation.Rhinoviruses and respiratory enteroviruses, which are non-enveloped viruses that are members of the same viral genus and are thus indistinguishable by most molecular tests, have been observed across multiple studies from different countries and regions. US national surveillance of respiratory viruses showed that rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus detections decreased substantially between March and May 2020 but then returned to the seasonal levels of previous years31. In California, a sentinel surveillance system reported levels of rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus activity that were similar to the levels in pre-COVID-19 pandemic seasons, with typical seasonal-level changes observed beginning in the autumn of 2021, after lower activity at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic56. Persistence of non-enveloped respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus, was also seen in South Korea despite stringent social distancing practices during the pandemic57,58. The authors of these studies suggested that this was due to the non-enveloped virus structure’s resistance to environmental factors and prolonged shedding. Similarly, in a nationwide analysis of paediatric data in a Finnish infectious disease registry, rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus detection initially decreased with early lockdown procedures and school closures but returned to typical levels as social distancing measures were eased59. During the winter season in Australia over the same period6, rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus were noted to be present at above-average levels, and the levels increased as schools reopened60. Studies from tropical regions, including Brazil61 and the Philippines62, where seasonality of respiratory viruses may differ from that in temperate regions, reported continued detection of rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus among respiratory samples tested during the pandemic.Collectively, these studies suggest that the inherent properties of rhinoviruses and respiratory enteroviruses, including the absence of a viral envelope, their stability on surfaces and the genomic diversity and number of strains that co-circulate, may allow infections to quickly increase and persist when the implementation of NPIs is relaxed. This is despite the continued suppression of other respiratory viruses by the remaining NPIs. A greater proportion of rhinovirus infections are minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic, compared with most other respiratory viruses, which may lead to ongoing transmission in settings where symptom screening was used as part of the criteria for school or work attendance. Given the sensitivity of rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus to changes in implementation of NPIs, some have proposed using rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus as a sentinel indicator of the stringency and effectiveness of NPI use63.Interestingly, studies have identified an inverse relationship between levels of SARS-CoV-2 and rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus in some locations. As rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus cases returned to near pre-pandemic levels in both California56 and South Korea57, their peaks and troughs were the inverse of those of SARS-CoV-2. While this finding may be incidental, viral interference7 (Box 2) between the three viruses may be possible64. A similar virus–virus interaction has been reported at the host and population level between rhinovirus and influenza virus65.Circulation of other non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemicAmong other non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses, there has been variation in circulation changes by viral species during the COVID-19 pandemic.Like influenza virus and RSV, seasonal human coronavirus16,31,32,66,67, human parainfluenza virus16,32,60,67,68 and human metapneumovirus16,32,60,67,68 experienced marked reductions in circulation at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic when NPIs were in place. All three are negative-stranded RNA viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae, and share the features of having a viral envelope, circulating primarily in paediatric populations and having a clear seasonality. These viruses all rebounded as pandemic NPIs were lifted, thought to be due to school reopening and relaxation of NPIs leading to transmission16,69.Adenoviruses and respiratory enteroviruses have both persisted despite NPIs. Although the levels of both decreased at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic16,32,67,70, there were fewer fluctuations in case counts of these viruses compared with influenza virus and RSV despite shifting community policies in some localities60. In part, the persistence of adenovirus may be attributable to its lack of a viral envelope, and environmental stability, leading to persistent detection on surfaces, and extended shedding among infected individuals71. In Europe, relaxation of NPIs was associated with a rapid increase in enterovirus D68 cases between July and October 2021 (ref.72).Reports on human bocavirus early in the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated different circulation patterns, with some reporting increasing positive testing rates66 and others showing decreased frequencies67,70. Studies from China and South Korea found initial decreases in cases of human bocavirus35,57 early in 2020, followed by a later resurgence beyond what was expected from previous season patterns in China35.Data on human parechovirus circulation patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic are limited, with one study showing a decrease in human parechovirus detection in young children early in 2020 (ref.67).Health care burden of non-SARS-CoV-2 virusesThe health care burden of respiratory virus infections during the COVID-19 pandemic reflected the changes seen in respiratory virus community circulation.From a health care utilization standpoint, the volume of emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus infections decreased at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as broad NPIs were first implemented. One study estimated that community face mask use was associated with a significant decrease in ED visits for diseases associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections, including exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)73. As public health measures were lifted and some viruses returned, a corresponding increase in health care utilization was also seen.While NPIs likely played an important part in medical visits, other factors may have also affected these measures of health care burden. Human behaviour and health care attendance changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with increases in telemedicine consultations, contributing to reports of fewer in-person clinic appointments74,75 and ED visits76,77,78,79. Supply chain shortages and changes in respiratory virus testing priorities may have led to a prioritization of testing for SARS-CoV-2 in some localities until reagents became available, which may have been associated with less testing and therefore less detection of other respiratory viruses20. But even as patients returned for in-person care and health care systems increased their capacity to test for non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses, there were fewer ED visits and hospital admissions associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses early in the COVID-19 pandemic.ED visits associated with respiratory illnesses and non-SARS-CoV-2 virusesThe weekly number of US ED visits associated with respiratory illnesses and non-SARS-CoV-2 infections decreased early in the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the corresponding weeks of 2017–2019 (ref.80). The number of ED visits associated primarily with respiratory concerns (including fever, cough and shortness of breath) initially increased between March and April 2020, but by the end of 2020, there were fewer non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory ED visits than in previous years. The start of the COVID-19 pandemic was also associated with a decline in US paediatric ED visits compared with 2019, with the greatest decreases observed for non-SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory illnesses81.France82, Israel83, South Africa84, Turkey85 and Finland76 also reported decreases in ED visits associated with respiratory illness at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there was considerable variability in the number of ED visits for respiratory illnesses as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, likely related to differences in country-specific implementation of NPIs.Changes to ED visits associated with specific viral pathogens have also been noted, despite variations in testing patterns and implementation of COVID-19 NPIs. Sharp declines of both influenza virus-related ED visits76,80,86,87,88 and RSV-related ED visits76,80,88 were reported as NPIs were implemented, consistent with the decline in the community circulation of influenza virus and RSV. In addition, ED visits in the USA associated with other enveloped respiratory viruses, such as human metapneumovirus and human parainfluenza virus, showed a similar decline and remained low for the duration of 2020 (ref.80). By contrast, the numbers of ED visits associated with the non-enveloped rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus were similar and sometimes higher than what was observed in previous years, which is consistent with their persistence in the community80.Hospital admissions associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus infectionsHospital admissions associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus infections showed declines similar to those of other measures of health care burden early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitalization rates are an important public health measure of disease severity, and population-level hospital-based surveillance systems were established before the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly to monitor seasonal influenza virus activity.As SARS-CoV-2 community spread began early in 2020, influenza-associated hospitalizations decreased internationally and continued to be at historically low levels until the 2021–2022 influenza season worldwide. Hospital-based surveillance early in the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia6, South Africa48 and South Korea58 showed reductions in influenza-associated hospitalizations throughout the remainder of 2020.In the USA, where surveillance of influenza-associated hospitalization is conducted through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET)89, the rates of influenza-associated hospitalization between February and March 2020 plateaued following community spread of SARS-CoV-2 (ref.90). During the 2020–2021 influenza season, US surveillance sites reported a cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate of 0.8 per 100,000 population, the lowest rate of any season since 2005, when data collection began91. US hospitalization rates by age group in that year were not calculated given the low numbers of influenza-associated hospitalizations. Through the subsequent waves of SARS-CoV-2, there was regional variation in the ongoing use of COVID-19 NPIs, and by the 2021–2022 influenza season, influenza-associated hospitalization rates had returned to the levels seen in previous influenza seasons. As of 11 June 2022, the cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rate in the US for all ages for the 2021–2022 influenza season was 17.1 per 100,000 population, compared with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic rate of 62.0 per 100,000 population during the 2016–2017 influenza season and 102.9 per 100,000 population during the 2019–2020 influenza season8.Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, RSV-associated hospitalizations declined in countries in both the Northern Hemisphere58,92,93,94,95,96 and the Southern Hemiphere48,53,97, where the typical RSV season was ending or just beginning, respectively. However, unlike influenza-associated hospitalizations, there has been variation in the trends of RSV-associated hospitalizations as COVID-19 NPIs were lifted. Many countries reported delayed returns of RSV-associated hospitalizations in comparison with pre-COVID-19 pandemic seasons, corresponding to community circulation patterns. In the USA, between October 2020 and April 2021, the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network98 reported a lower RSV-associated hospitalization rate (0.3 per 100,000 persons) than in the two prior seasons (27.1 per 100,000 persons and 33.4 per 100,000 persons)54. Of the RSV-associated hospitalizations between October 2020 and May 2021, 77% were reported during April and May 2021, illustrating a shift in the typical peak of RSV-associated hospitalizations, which usually peak in the winter months31. One New York City area hospital reported a delay in its expected winter peak of RSV-associated hospitalizations during the 2020-2021 RSV season to the spring and summer months99. Potential reasons for this shift may be lower population-level immunity from lack of infections because of reduced circulation during the early days of the pandemic, leading to a larger susceptible pool of individuals who can be infected and transmit RSV.Shifts in hospitalizations associated with the RSV season have also been seen in other countries, with variations in the degree of delay relative to previous seasons. In France, the 2020–2021 RSV season was characterized by a 3–4-month delay in the seasonal peak of RSV-associated hospitalizations100,101. Moreover, one Spanish hospital reported that RSV-associated bronchiolitis admissions were delayed until June 2021; in previous seasons, RSV-associated hospitalization peaks typically occurred between November and February95.In the Southern Hemisphere, countries also experienced delays in RSV-associated hospitalizations during the 2020 winter months. Regional reports from Western Australia noted significant reductions in RSV-associated infections during the winter months47,53. However, an uncharacteristic interseasonal increase of RSV-associated ED visits and hospitalizations occurred in the spring and continued into the early summer months following the lifting of social distancing policies but before relaxation of restrictions on interstate travel53. In 2020, RSV-associated hospitalizations in Buenos Aires, Argentina, were very low during the winter months, when hospitalizations typically peak. In the winter season of 2021, a seasonal peak of RSV-associated hospitalizations returned following the reopening of schools in the community, but was delayed by 10 weeks compared with the 2016–2019 seasons97. The unpredictable onset and duration of the RSV season after initial COVID-19 pandemic NPIs were implemented complicated decisions around administration of palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody given to infants at increased risk of severe illness during the RSV season102.In addition to the variation in RSV incidence shifts, there has been considerable geographic variation in the proportion of RSV infections requiring hospitalization, with some countries reporting higher rates and others lower rates as RSV re-emerged100. Moreover, one US study reported that children hospitalized with RSV during the 2020–2021 season required higher levels of care (81% versus 45%, respectively, admitted to an intensive care unit) and had a longer median length of hospitalization (4 days versus 3 days, respectively) than children hospitalized with RSV during the 2019–2020 season99.Why these changes in the epidemiology of RSV occurred is not known, although these shifts may be in part due to waning population-level immunity. Infants are protected through transplacentally derived maternal antibody in the first several weeks of life. Low levels of RSV circulation will lead to waning population RSV antibody titres, and subsequently lead to lower levels of maternal antibody being transferred to infants during gestation103. This has the potential to result in a birth cohort with low levels of maternally derived antibody to experience their first RSV season, at a time when RSV circulation is much higher than in prior years. This would lead to both increased risk of infection and minimal neutralizing antibody titres to protect against severe disease. Simultaneously, there will also be older children who will also encounter their first RSV infection, and infections in young and older children could strain hospital capacity. Modelling studies have estimated that RSV hospitalizations in the post-pandemic period were twice as great as in a normal RSV season for children aged 1 year or younger, but to be highly dependent on NPIs in place and introductions of the virus from other regions104.Data on hospital admissions due to other non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses are limited. Several reports demonstrate that rhinovirus-associated and respiratory enterovirus-associated hospitalizations in adults and children persisted or appeared to increase as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, coinciding in part with the return of in-person school instruction for children58,92,105,106. A retrospective study of paediatric hospitalizations in one US children’s hospital reported a persistence of rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus detection, while the number of other viruses decreased92. In a report on hospitalized adult patients from the UK, there was an initial decrease in rhinovirus-positive and respiratory enterovirus-positive test results between March and September 2020 (ref.105). However, 2 weeks after the reopening of primary and secondary schools, there was a notable increase in the detection of rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus in these hospitalized patients, reaching levels seen during the 2019 season105. In both China106 and South Korea58, the numbers of rhinovirus-associated hospitalizations in the summer months of 2020 were higher than the numbers reported in previous seasons.Whether increases in rhinovirus and respiratory enterovirus circulation reflect decreased interactions with other respiratory viruses, alteration of predominant rhinovirus species or serotypes, or an opportunistic change where rhinovirus infections are filling a niche left by decreases in the numbers of enveloped viruses is unknown. However, rhinovirus sequencing data early in the COVID-19 pandemic showed no significant changes in rhinovirus species predominance in comparison with previous seasons57,106.Similar persistence patterns were also observed for other non-enveloped viruses, including adenovirus and human bocavirus, which demonstrated persistent but oscillating detections as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded58.Reports on hospitalizations associated with other non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses are limited, but some studies have shown similar declines at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In one US paediatric hospital, there was an abrupt decrease in non-SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalizations after 21 April 2020 that continued through to December 2020 (ref.92). In addition to no reported cases of influenza virus-associated or RSV-associated hospitalization, there were no hospitalizations for human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza or seasonal human coronavirus infections through to 31 December 2020 (ref.92). Hospital surveillance data from South Korea also demonstrated decreases in the monthly rate of detection of enveloped viruses, including human parainfluenza virus, seasonal human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus58.Respiratory disease associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 virusesThe landscape of clinical respiratory disease burden not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection has also changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respiratory syndromes and conditions such as otitis media, pneumonia and invasive bloodstream infections have been affected by shifts in viral pathogens, showing initial declines in frequency and alterations that match the clinical epidemiology of community-acquired respiratory viruses.Acute respiratory illnesses and ILIDeclines in cases of acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) and ILI were associated with the mitigation of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses and have been reported most prominently among children. One multicentre ARI surveillance study in the USA showed a sharp decline in paediatric ARI cases in April 2020 after many communities had implemented stay-at-home orders107. This was largely due to the decline of influenza-associated and RSV-associated ARI.In a multicentre prospective study of primary care paediatric practices in Germany between November 2020 and April 2021, rhinovirus was the most commonly detected respiratory virus among children with ARI, while SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections were minimally detected108. Among children in Thailand seeking care, there was a notable increase in cases of ILI caused by rhinovirus in July 2020, which were replaced by RSV-associated ILI cases later in the season109. This suggests that although overall numbers of ILI cases declined, rhinovirus and RSV were important contributors to those cases that did require hospitalization.All-cause outpatient ILI surveillance in the USA, conducted through ILI-Net, has shown general fluctuating patterns between the 2019–2020 and 2021–2022 influenza seasons8. The changes in the percentages of ILI outpatient visits are likely due in large part to the waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults, but are possibly also due in part to non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses as endemic respiratory virus infections increased during 2021–2022 with the relaxation of NPIs. In a study of ILI in South Korea, the levels of respiratory virus causes fluctuated with community circulation, including initially lower levels of human bocavirus followed by increases in the detection rate towards the end of 2020 (ref.57).Community-acquired pneumonia incidenceCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) causes substantial clinical burden and has both viral and bacterial aetiologies110,111. Many early COVID-19 pandemic reports showed a decrease in the incidence of non-COVID-19 CAP that was associated with the implementation of community NPIs112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120. Comparisons of these CAP cases early in the COVID-19 pandemic with CAP cases in periods during the pandemic but before NPI implementation and with CAP cases in previous seasons show a change in both bacterial and viral aetiologies118,121.One multicentre study in Germany observed a seasonal decline in the frequencies of CAP cases associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses, and these corresponded to a reduction in the diversity of the causative viral pathogen (that is, there were fewer types of respiratory viruses associated with CAP)121. For instance, from May 2020 through the remainder of the year, there was an abrupt reduction in the diversity of pathogens, with only rhinovirus-associated CAP as a persistent and lingering viral cause of non-COVID-19 CAP.Bronchiolitis incidenceThe burden and epidemiology of bronchiolitis, a common lower respiratory tract disease diagnosis in young children, has also been impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.While bronchiolitis can be associated with any respiratory virus infection, including SARS-CoV-2 infection and influenza virus infection, cases are commonly associated with RSV infection122. Many countries reported changes in the frequency of bronchiolitis cases that mirrored trends in community circulation of RSV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Bronchiolitis cases decreased in Northern Hemisphere countries, with low numbers of cases reported throughout much of the 2020–2021 respiratory virus season94,95,96,120,123,124,125,126.The implementation of NPIs early in 2020 occurred at a time when seasonal cases of bronchiolitis were expected in the Southern Hemisphere. However, acute lower respiratory tract infections, including bronchiolitis, in children in Argentina remained low for the duration of the 2020 season, when bronchiolitis and other paediatric lower respiratory tract infection peaks were expected127. In Brazil, infant hospitalizations for respiratory disease, including bronchiolitis, declined during April and June 2020 (typically seasonal peaks occur from March to July)128. In Australia, fewer cases of hospitalized bronchiolitis and fewer bronchiolitis admissions to paediatric intensive care units were observed than in previous seasons129. However, sentinel surveillance of Australian hospital records when RSV epidemics reoccurred in late 2020 to early 2021 showed numbers similar to or higher than the numbers in previous seasons, confirming the mirrored incidence of bronchiolitis and RSV community transmission130.Chronic respiratory disease incidenceChronic respiratory diseases have also been impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Exacerbations of asthma and COPD are frequently associated with respiratory virus infections, and national lockdowns and pandemic NPIs were associated with fewer asthma hospital admissions in the early COVID-19 pandemic period120,124,125,131. In the UK, in addition to fewer asthma admissions, there were reductions in severe asthma exacerbations, with no significant changes in deaths due to asthma132. Frequencies of hospital admissions for exacerbations of COPD have also declined in South Korea and Slovenia133,134.Several explanations have been proposed to explain these findings, including infections and non-infectious causes. Respiratory virus infections are frequently associated with exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases. Therefore, the decreased community circulation, which is associated with behavioural changes and NPIs, may have led to fewer exacerbations attributed to respiratory viruses. One report noted that there was an increase in the number of prescriptions for inhaled and oral corticosteroid before lockdown was implemented, possibly due to concern about medication shortages or access during lockdown, and higher adherence to controller medication use132. Fewer hospitalizations due to asthma and COPD may also be due to improved home management of exacerbations. Other factors associated with fewer chronic respiratory disease exacerbations include additional changes in health-seeking behaviour, such as the use of telehealth visits that allowed management of exacerbations at home and reduction in air pollution from stay-at-home measures135.Virus-associated severe illnesses and deathsSevere illnesses associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus infections declined during some periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, only one influenza-associated paediatric death was reported in the USA during the 2020–2021 season, in contrast to144 deaths during the 2018–2019 season and 199 deaths during the 2019–2020 season. From October 2021 to April 2022, 24 influenza-associated paediatric deaths were reported in the USA, corresponding to increased influenza virus activity during the 2021–2022 season8.Evolution of influenza viruses and other non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virusesThe global implementation of NPIs, broad community spread of SARS-CoV-2 and individual behaviour changes during the COVID-19 pandemic seem to have dramatically reduced the circulation of common respiratory viruses. However, many respiratory viruses returned as these measures were lifted, with the frequency of infections and circulation patterns influenced by regional differences in community NPIs. A hallmark of respiratory viruses is their ability to continue circulating despite the accumulated population immunity from infections, and in the case of influenza virus infections, the variable use of vaccines. Evolution is central to immune evasion by respiratory viruses, and is facilitated by genetic mutations from a diverse viral gene pool. The sudden drop in respiratory virus transmission may have affected the genetic diversity of many viral species by creating an evolutionary bottleneck, but the lasting effects of this evolutionary pressure will vary and will be impacted by many factors, such as changing population-level susceptibility, the introduction of strains through increased international travel and the development of novel vaccines.Impact of changes in viral transmissionBoth baseline pre-pandemic genetic diversity and specific viral characteristics may influence a virus’s ability to resist the selection pressure associated with NPI use. RSV, for example, circulates in the community as two subtypes, RSV-A and RSV-B, that can alternate in predominance in many regions. In Australia, both subtypes frequently co-circulate with similar prevalence130. Before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, RSV genomic diversity was maintained by sources both within and outside Australia136. However, genomic analyses of samples obtained before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic showed both a change in the RSV subtype predominance (with RSV-A predominating after community NPIs were implemented) and a reduction in RSV-A sublineages and the emergence of novel lineages, which were genomically linked to frequent domestic importations as well as rarer importations from Washington state in the USA130. Whether similar changes in RSV subtype predominance or genomic diversity were experienced in other regions is not known, and subsequent analyses will be needed to understand whether regional RSV diversity could be restored as global travel increases.By contrast, limited genomic analyses of rhinoviruses suggested a different outcome during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rhinovirus includes several species that are genetically diverse and are able to continuously circulate in the community despite NPIs. Although differentiating rhinovirus types through genomic sequencing is not always possible, the predominance of rhinovirus species in South Korea did not seem to change during the COVID-19 pandemic despite community SARS-CoV-2 mitigation efforts57.Similarly, although there was an initial reduction in the detection of seasonal human coronavirus throughout 2020, epidemics did occur early in 2021 in the USA as all four seasonal human coronavirus species reappeared, coinciding with the relaxing of NPIs later in the COVID-19 pandemic137. Epidemic peaks in early 2021 occurred at different time points, differing by geographic region and viral species, with most regions experiencing increased prevalence of seasonal human coronavirus that continued throughout early summer137. Data are limited on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on seasonal human coronavirus genomic diversity. One study comparing the genomic diversity of seasonal human coronavirus infections in homeless shelters before and during the COVID-19 pandemic showed similar diversity between the two periods138.Impact of changes in immunityChanges in immunity may also influence the evolution of some viruses. For influenza viruses, for instance, population-level immunity is developed from prior infections and vaccination. With the decline in levels of circulating influenza viruses, lower vaccination coverage and antigenic drift, defined as small changes in the viral genome associated with errors in viral replication, leading to vaccine subtype mismatch39,139, waning humoral immunity, as defined by lower antibody titres, may make infection more likely, leading to more infections, increased viral replication and additional opportunities for mutations leading to emergence of new variants. It is also possible that in locations where influenza vaccination is not widely administered, waning immunity from recent infections can result in high infection attack rates despite limited influenza virus diversity. Moreover, the strain selection process for the influenza vaccine depends on an evaluation of humoral immunity, specifically haemagglutinin inhibition antibody titres against the circulating virus strains from influenza sentinel surveillance sites in the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. Low levels of circulating influenza virus may also create challenges for the annual vaccine strain selection process because the smaller number of characterized viruses identified through surveillance makes it more difficult to predict the predominant influenza virus strains for the upcoming season for inclusion in the vaccine, with unknown effect on influenza vaccine effectiveness.Impact of travelInternational travel, which has facilitated the spread of respiratory viruses, may also influence the evolution of certain viruses. Global circulation and seasonal epidemic patterns of influenza virus vary by species and type. Influenza A(H3N2) virus continuously circulated in a complex network of regional epidemics in eastern Asia and Southeast Asia that subsequently facilitated the seeding of temperate regions outside this area, leading to annual seasonal epidemics140.By contrast, during the pandemic, influenza A(H1N1) virus and influenza B virus experienced relatively slower rates of evolution and were less reliant on viral seeding from Asia, with variants continuing to circulate across multiple seasons141. It is possible that changes in travel behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic may have had differential effects on viral species and types. The resumption of global travel is likely to facilitate the spread and evolution of influenza viruses and other respiratory viruses by enhancing the diversity of the viral genetic pool.The broad application of genomic sequencing to study SARS-CoV-2 molecular epidemiology has enhanced our understanding of respiratory virus evolution. Expanded sequencing of non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses will be useful to monitor viral diversity and evolutionary changes during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and with the introduction of vaccines, antiviral, and monoclonal antibodies for prevention and treatment.Changes in the influenza B/Yamagata virus lineage and observations from the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemicOne evolutionary change observed during the COVID-19 pandemic is the possible extinction of the influenza B/Yamagata virus lineage, with no confirmed detections from March 2020 onward142. The 2019–2020 influenza season in the USA was characterized by influenza B/Victoria virus predominance, with a later predominance of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus143. During the US 2020–2021 season, low levels of influenza-positive test results were reported, with influenza B virus predominating144. Influenza virus activity resumed during 2021–2022 but was lower than in most seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic.Interestingly, Nextstrain last reported influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus in March 2020 (ref.145). Similarly, FluNet, a WHO global influenza virological surveillance tool started in 1997 through the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, has shown a dramatic reduction in influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus detections reported, with none confirmed by sequencing after March 2020146 (Fig. 2). Ongoing global influenza surveillance will determine whether the influenza B/Yamagata virus lineage is no longer circulating and whether this viral antigen no longer needs to be included in the composition of quadrivalent influenza vaccines used worldwide.Fig. 2: Surveillance of influenza viruses by the World Health Organization Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System 2019–2022.The prevalence of influenza A(H3N2) virus, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, influenza B/Yamagata virus and influenza B/Victoria virus is shown. The date range of the data extends from 2019 epidemiological week 17 to 2022 epidemiological week 16. The last confirmed report of influenza B/Yamagata virus was in March 2020 (ref.146). Adapted with permission from ref.146, WHO.Full size imageRecent influenza pandemics offer few clues as to how COVID-19 will affect the circulation of seasonal influenza viruses. In 2009, the emergence of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was associated with a marked decline in seasonal influenza A and influenza B viruses147 and replacement of seasonal influenza A(H1N1) virus in subsequent seasons148. Although low numbers of circulating seasonal influenza viruses were reported while COVID-19 pandemic NPIs were in place, the longer-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be apparent until future influenza seasons.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented societal and human behaviour changes that have altered the community circulation of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses. Although changes in testing priorities and available resources may have influenced the earliest reports of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory virus activity, subsequent studies across multiple geographic locations have shown consistent reductions in the activity of most respiratory virus species. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, there were increasing differences in the application of NPIs and community circulation of SARS-CoV-2 that led to variability in the return of some respiratory viruses. Most notably, influenza virus activity, including the clinical burden of disease and paediatric mortality, remained low through the 2020–2021 season before influenza virus activity increased in 2021–2022. While influenza A and influenza B viruses have begun circulating more widely, influenza B/Yamagata viruses have hardly been detected, and ongoing surveillance will inform whether these viruses might be extinct. Detections of RSV infections initially remained low, with the resurgence of interseasonal circulation in many locations since 2021. There is also evidence that influenza virus diversity and RSV diversity have been reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but whether these changes are maintained requires continued surveillance and genomic analyses.Unlike many of the enveloped viruses, non-enveloped viruses, including rhinovirus, demonstrated remarkable persistence through NPIs, with early evidence showing similar species circulation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In part, the persistence of non-enveloped viruses despite NPI implementation may be due to prolonged shedding, their greater diversity and their persistence on environmental surfaces.These collective findings and lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic have important implications for pandemic preparedness. Although the changes in circulation of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses cannot be attributed to any one factor, the near-simultaneous implementation of NPIs at individual, community, environmental and country levels, in addition to behavioural changes, seems to have been an important contributor to reducing community circulation, decreasing the associated health care burden and blunting the evolution of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses. As such, these collective NPI strategies and global collaboration will be important public health considerations for the next pandemic. ReferencesCollaborators, C.-E. M.

And how does it work? Keep reading to find out. Each year, it’s recommended that everyone age 6 months and older get a flu shot. Why? Because it’s the best way to protect yourself from the flu — helping to prevent serious illness, hospitalizations and even death. Ever wonder how the flu shot works to provide this protection? Here’s the science behind the vaccine. How does the flu shot work? “The vaccine works by introducing a small protein from the virus into your body. This causes your body to produce antibodies to fight the disease and creates some degree of immunity in case you’re faced with the real virus later,” explains Stanley Martin, MD, director of Geisinger’s Division of Infectious Diseases, adding that it takes about two weeks for the shot to be most effective, which is why it’s recommended that you get your vaccination in the fall, before flu season even begins. What if it’s later in the season and you still haven’t gotten your shot? Don’t worry — you’ve still got time. “Geisinger still offers flu shots through March,” says Dr. Martin. “And with COVID-19 continuing to spread, it’s once again important to be vaccinated against both viruses. You certainly don’t want to catch both at once. Protect yourself where you can.” What’s in the flu vaccine? Each year, researchers determine which strains of the flu virus are the most likely to occur during the upcoming season and the vaccines are designed accordingly. “Most flu vaccines protect against four types of viruses,” explains Dr. Martin. “An influenza A (H1N1) virus, an influenza A (H3N2) virus and two influenza B viruses.” The vaccine can be made from an inactivated virus — which means the particles have been grown in a culture and have lost their ability to cause disease. The vaccine can also be made from a recombinant virus — which means it’s been created synthetically and can't reproduce and cause disease. A third option is the live (but weakened) virus, which is used in the nasal spray vaccine. “All choices work equally well,” explains Dr. Martin, “but the live virus is not recommended for anyone with a weakened immune system, pregnant women or those with certain other medical conditions.” I’m allergic to eggs. Can I get a flu shot? Most flu vaccines, whether they're administered through a shot in the arm or through a nasal spray, are made using an egg-based process. The virus is injected into fertilized chicken eggs, where it incubates and replicates for several days. This means a minute amount of egg protein may be in the vaccine. But the amount is so small it’s negligible to the vast majority of people with an egg allergy, and they can still tolerate the flu shot just fine. In fact, the flu shot has been given to many people with an egg allergy without any serious adverse reaction. Only in cases where someone has a history of severe anaphylaxis — a type of allergic reaction requiring hospitalization — in response to eggs should there be cause for concern. If you’re one of these few people, not to worry: There is a limited supply of egg-free flu vaccines for those with a demonstrated history of anaphylaxis. Other ways of preventing the flu “The flu vaccine is your best defense against catching the flu,” says Dr. Martin. “Other precautions to take are the same ones we’ve been following to protect against COVID-19. Avoid close contact with others, stay home when you’re sick, wear a face mask when you’re out in public and wash your hands often.” Get your flu shot at Geisinger Every year, we make it as easy as possible for you to get vaccinated against the flu. You can make an appointment, walk into a clinic or provider’s office or visit a drive-through location. The flu shot is your “best shot” against catching the flu. That’s why we do everything we can to keep you, and the rest of the community, protected. See all the ways to get your flu shot.

Amman, 8 August 2022 – Stakeholders from 5 priority countries in the Region identified approaches that could be adopted in their national seasonal influenza vaccination programme during a meeting conducted in Amman, Jordan, from 24 to 26 July 2022. Immunization and influenza focal points from ministries of health and WHO country offices, supported by technical experts from the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, WHO headquarters, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Partnership for Influenza Vaccine Introduction (PIVI) programme attended the meeting. While influenza causes high morbidity and mortality around the world and safe and effective influenza vaccines have been available for more than 60 years, uptake of influenza vaccine remains suboptimal in the Region. The meeting aimed to build on the foundations of functional influenza surveillance systems and the lessons learned from COVID-19 vaccine deployment. Over the 3-day meeting, participants from Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, and a range of experts worked together to understand the situation of influenza vaccination globally and regionally, as well as to review available strategic frameworks, such as the life course immunization strategy and regional roadmap on strengthening influenza vaccine use. This helped to inform participants of the influenza situation and the support available to them before working as country teams to develop their individual country workplans. Participants discussed different approaches for the seasonal influenza vaccination programme. Despite the differing situations of countries, much of their workplans were similar in terms of the areas they wanted to focus on, such as the generation of country-specific data, development and updates to policy, including review of the responsible parties for influenza vaccination, dissemination of the updated and new policy, development of a communication plan and continuous advocacy, capacity-building, and education for all stakeholders. WHO and partners will continue to support countries to realize the implementation of their individual workplans over the coming months. They also aim to expand this targeted approach to other countries in the Region as these priority countries strengthen their seasonal influenza vaccination programmes. This will contribute to the main goal of enhancing the availability, accessibility and utilization of seasonal influenza vaccine in the Region to reduce influenza-associated morbidity and mortality among high-risk groups and other groups of national priority.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Viral TikTok star Emmanuel – an emu who gained a vast online following thanks to videos shared by his owner at Knuckle Bump Farms in Florida – has reportedly fallen sick with avian influenza. Farm owner Taylor Blake wrote on Twitter that wild geese brought avian influenza to the farm, with many birds having since died. As a large outbreak sweeps poultry farms across the US and the UK, many people are now asking: what exactly is avian influenza, and what do I need to know? Read more: Nearly half a million poultry deaths: there are 3 avian influenza outbreaks in Victoria. Should we be worried? What is avian influenza? Avian influenza is a disease caused by an influenza A virus, affecting birds across many species. It can have significant consequences for the poultry industry, due to its potential impact on bird health, production and even international trade. Although avian influenza does not usually infect people, it is considered a zoonotic virus. That means it can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected birds, and sporadic cases have been seen when outbreaks happen in poultry. Some avian influenza viruses are more pathogenic than others. Pathogenic means disease-causing, so if highly pathogenic avian influenza gets into a poultry farm, it can cause sudden and significant mortality. It has been reported the outbreak underway on the farm where Emmanuel lives is a highly pathogenic strain, which has been affecting poultry and wild birds in the US since January 2022. Even low pathogenic strains can make birds unwell and cause them to lay fewer eggs. Avian influenza infections in humans can cause a range of clinical symptoms, from mild upper respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia. Some strains of avian influenza, such as highly pathogenic H5N1 and H7N9, can cause significant disease in humans, and in some instances even death. Recommended standard treatment for humans is with antiviral drugs, and will depend on individual circumstances and severity of the symptoms. In domestic birds, the most likely path of infection is through contact with infected wild birds. This could be direct contact or contact through water contaminated with wild bird droppings. Generally, an outbreak of avian influenza on a poultry farm means many birds have to be culled in an effort to stop the spread. Is there any avian flu in Australia? Australia is classed by the World Organisation for Animal Health as free of avian influenza in the domestic bird population. However, we do currently have a low-level circulation of low pathogenic influenza viruses among wild birds. We have had several low and highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in domestic poultry in Australia before, with the most recent one affecting farms in Victoria. Many birds were culled to eradicate the disease and in all cases eradication was successful. None of the viruses causing these outbreaks in Australia have caused disease in humans. However, it is important that we use hygienic practices and biosecurity when working with poultry. We currently do not have H5N1 in Australia; waterfowl, the bird species most likely to carry this virus, do not migrate to Australia. In addition, Australia has very strict biosecurity measures to prevent disease introduction through imports. Therefore, the risk of introduction of this strain into the country is very low. Most measures aimed at reducing the risk of avian influenza outbreaks in poultry in Australia have focused on reducing contact between wild birds and farmed birds. That means limiting the access wild birds can get to farms, as well as protecting and treating water sources. In the past decade, we have seen an increase in the number of domestic outbreaks in Australia. Previous research suggests this increase could be associated with an increase in free range poultry over the last 30 years. A paper I coauthored in 2019 modelled how intervention strategies could reduce risk, noting that: a shift of 25% of conventional indoor farms to free-range farming practices would result in a 6–7% increase in the risk of a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak. Current practices to treat water are highly effective, reducing the risk of outbreaks by 25–28% compared to no water treatment. Halving wild bird presence in feed storage areas could reduce risk by 16–19% while halving wild bird access of potential bridge-species to sheds could reduce outbreak risk by 23–25%. A large outbreak in Australia would be enormously costly to industry, cause a vast number of birds to die and could potentially pose a health risk to humans. Although vaccines for avian influenza for poultry are available, these would only be considered if an outbreak became widespread. Following appropriate biosecurity practices on poultry farms continues to be the most important prevention tool we have to avoid outbreaks.

In the past few days, both France and the United Kingdom have announced new biosafety measures aimed at curbing the swiftly spreading illness. Dozens of infected penguins in South Africa have died recently, and on Wednesday South Korea reported its first case in six months. In the United States, the disease is driving up prices for turkey a month before Thanksgiving, in which the bird plays a central part. The prevalence of the disease is the highest on record in Europe, and the number of domesticated birds that have died over the past year is approaching a record in the United States.

Influenza is one of the deadliest viruses in the world (Image credit: Shutterstock) Jump to: Marburg virus Ebola virus Rabies HIV Smallpox Hantavirus Influenza Dengue Rotavirus SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 MERS-CoV Humans have been fighting viruses since the species has existed. For some viral diseases, vaccines and antiviral drugs have prevented widespread infection or helped people recover. And we've even been able to eradicate one disease — smallpox. Some viruses pose a bigger threat than others. The viral strain that drove the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa kills up to 90% of the people it infects, making it the most lethal member of the Ebola family.Related: 20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in historyBut there are other viruses that are are even deadlier. Some viruses, including the novel coronavirus currently driving outbreaks around the globe, have lower fatality rates, but still pose a serious threat to public health because they infect so many people. Here are the 12 worst killers, based on the likelihood that a person will die if they are infected with one of them, the sheer numbers of people they have killed and whether they represent a growing threat.Marburg virusThe Marburg virus causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. (Image credit: ROGER HARRIS/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Marburg virus was first identified by scientists in 1967, when small outbreaks occurred among lab workers in Germany who were exposed to infected monkeys imported from Uganda. Marburg virus symptoms are similar to Ebola in that both viruses can cause hemorrhagic fever, meaning that infected people develop high fevers, and bleeding throughout the body that can lead to shock, organ failure and death, according to Mayo Clinic.The case fatality rate in the first outbreak (1967) was 24%, but it was 83% in the 1998-2000 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and 100% in the 2017 outbreak in Uganda, according to the WHO. The first known Marburg virus outbreak in West Africa was confirmed in August 2021. The case was a male from south-western Guinea, who developed a fever, headache, fatigue, abdominal pain and gingival hemorrhage before ultimately dying of the disease. This outbreak lasted for six weeks and, while there were 170 high-risk contacts, only one case was confirmed, according to Reuters.Ebola virusMicroscopic image of an Ebola virus (Image credit: Shutterstock)In 1976, the first known Ebola outbreaks in humans struck simultaneously in the Republic of the Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Ebola is spread through contact with blood or other body fluids, or tissue from infected people or animals. The known strains vary dramatically in their deadliness, Dr. Elke Muhlberger, an Ebola virus expert and associate professor of microbiology at Boston University, told Live Science.One strain, Ebola Reston, doesn't even make people sick, though it is deadly to other primates, according to Essential Human Virology (2016). But for the Bundibugyo strain, the human fatality rate is up to 25%, and it is up to 90% for the Zaire strain.The largest Ebola outbreak on record emerged in West Africa in early 2014 and took two years to resolve. During that time, it infected 28,652 people and claimed 11,325 lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Transmission (CDC).In December 2020, the Ervebo vaccine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This vaccine helps to defend against the Zaire ebola virus and a global stockpile became available from January 2021. Dr. Elke MühlbergerSocial Links NavigationProfessor of Microbiology at Boston UniversityDr. Elke Mühlberger is a professor of microbiology and the director of Integrated Science Services at the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) at Boston University. Dr. Mühlberger is a renowned expert in the field of BSL-4 hemorrhagic fever viruses. She has a strong research focus on the highly pathogenic filoviruses, Ebola and Marburg virus. She received her PhD in Virology from the Philipps University Marburg, Marburg, Germany in 1993 and continued to work on filoviruses as an independent PI and group leader in Marburg. In 2008, she joined the Department of Microbiology at Boston University.RabiesThis image of the rabies virus, taken through an electron microscope, shows particles of the virus itself, as well as the round structures called Negri bodies, which contain viral proteins. (Image credit: CDC/ Dr. Fred Murphy)Although rabies vaccines for pets, which were introduced in the 1920s, helped to make the disease extremely rare in the developed world, this condition remains a serious problem in India and parts of Africa. About 59,000 people die every year from the virus, according to a 2019 study in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.Infection from this virus develops after a bite or scratch from an infected mammal. Once a person is bitten, they must immediately get rabies vaccines or antibody treatments to prevent the disease from progressing. If they don't, the virus will damage the brain and nerves. Once symptoms begin to show, death almost always follows; the virus has a 99% fatality rate, according to the CDC."It destroys the brain, it's a really, really bad disease," Muhlberger said. "We have a vaccine against rabies, and we have antibodies that work against rabies, so if someone gets bitten by a rabid animal we can treat this person," she said.However, she said, "if you don't get treatment, there's a 100% possibility you will die."HIVThis scanning electron microscope image shows the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, in green), infecting a cell. (Image credit: Cynthia Goldsmith, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)In the modern world, the deadliest virus of all may be HIV. "It is still the one that is the biggest killer," Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and spokesman for the Infectious Disease Society of America told Live Science.An estimated 32 million people have died from HIV since the disease was first recognized in the early 1980s. "The infectious disease that takes the biggest toll on mankind right now is HIV," Adalja said.Powerful antiviral drugs have made it possible for people to live for years with HIV. And in rare cases, stem cell transplants have cured the disease. But the disease continues to devastate many low- and middle-income countries, where 95% of new HIV infections occur. Nearly 1 in every 25 adults within the World Health Organization Africa region is HIV-positive, meaning that there are over two-thirds of the people living with HIV worldwide, according to the WHO. In 2021, there were 650,000 HIV-related deaths worldwide. Dr. Amesh AdaljaSocial Links NavigationInfectious disease physician Dr. Amesh Adalja is an infectious disease physician specialising in emerging infectious diseases, pandemic preparedness, and biosecurity. A Senior Scholar at the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland in the United States of America (USA), he is also a spokesman for the Infectious Disease Society of America. A fellow of the American College of Physicians, and the American College of Emergency Physicians, he obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial management from Carnegie Mellon University in 1995 and graduated from the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine in 2002.SmallpoxIllustration of a smallpox virus (Image credit: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images)In 1980, the World Health Assembly declared the world free of smallpox. But before that, humans had battled smallpox for thousands of years, and the more severe version of the disease, Variola major, killed about 30% of those it infected, according to the WHO. It left survivors with deep, permanent scars and, often, blindness.In populations outside of Europe, where people had little contact with the virus before visitors brought it to their regions, mortality rates were much higher. For example, historians estimate that smallpox, which was introduced by European explorers, killed 90% of the native population of the Americas. In the 20th century alone, smallpox killed 300 million people, according to National Geographic."It was something that had a huge burden on the planet, not just death but also blindness, and that's what spurred the campaign to eradicate from the Earth," Adalja said.HantavirusThe hantavirus caused an outbreak in November 1993, in the Four Corners region of the U.S. (Image credit: Getty)Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a deadly disease for those who contract it, but it has killed relatively few people. It first gained wide attention in the U.S. in 1993, according to the CDC). A healthy, young Navajo man and his fiancée living in the Four Corners area of the United States died within days of developing shortness of breath. A few months later, health authorities isolated hantavirus from a deer mouse living in the home of one of the infected people. More than 833 people in the U.S. have contracted HPS as of the end of 2020, the last year that data was reported for, and 35% have died from the disease, according to the CDC.The virus is not transmitted from one person to another, rather, people contract the disease from exposure to the droppings of infected mice.Previously, a different hantavirus, called Korean hemorrhagic fever, caused an outbreak in the early 1950s, during the Korean War, according to a 2010 paper in the journal Clinical Microbiology Reviews. More than 3,000 United Nations troops became infected, and about 12% of them died.While the virus was new to Western medicine when it was discovered in the U.S., researchers realized later that Navajo medical traditions describe a similar illness, and linked the disease to mice.InfluenzaWomen working for the Red Cross make masks during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 (Image credit: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images)Influenza kills a small proportion of the people it infects, at about 1.8 in 100,000 people every year, according to the CDC. But because it infects so many people, it's one of the leading killers worldwide. During a typical flu season, up to 650,000 people worldwide will die from the illness, according to WHO. And occasionally, a new flu strain emerges, and a pandemic spreads across the globe. Often, these new strains have higher mortality rates than endemic flu.The most deadly flu pandemic, sometimes called the Spanish flu, began in 1918 and sickened up to 40% of the world's population, killing an estimated 50 million people, according to CDC."I think that it is possible that something like the 1918 flu outbreak could occur again," Muhlberger said. "If a new influenza strain found its way in the human population, and could be transmitted easily between humans, and caused severe illness, we would have a big problem."DengueDengue viruses are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. (Image credit: Getty)Dengue hemorrhagic fever, caused by the dengue virus, is a mosquito-borne disease that first appeared in the 1950s in the Philippines and Thailand. It has since spread throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the globe, according to a 2009 study in the journal Clinical Microbiology Reviews. Up to 40% of the world's population now lives in areas where dengue is endemic and the disease will spread farther as climate change enables the mosquitoes that carry it to spread to other regions, according to the journal Nature .According to WHO, dengue infects 100 to 400 million people a year. Although dengue fever has a lower mortality rate than some other viruses, at around 1%, the virus can cause an Ebola-like disease called dengue hemorrhagic fever, which has a mortality rate of 20% if left untreated. "We really need to think more about dengue virus because it is a real threat to us," Muhlberger said. A vaccine for dengue, called Dengvaxia was approved in 2019 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in children ages 9 to16 years old living in areas where dengue is common and with a confirmed history of virus infection, according to the CDC. In some countries, an approved vaccine is available for those who are 9 to 45 years old, but again, recipients must have contracted a confirmed case of dengue in the past. Those who have not caught the virus before could be put at risk of developing severe dengue if given the vaccine. RotavirusRotaviruses particles are shown here under a very high magnification of 455,882X. (Image credit: CDC/ Dr. Erskine L. Palmer)Rotavirus is a diarrheal disease that kills about 200,000 children annually, mostly in Nigeria and India, according to PreventRotavirus, a council dedicated to widespread use of rotavirus vaccines. The virus can spread rapidly, through what researchers call the fecal-oral route (meaning that small particles of feces end up being consumed).Thanks to vaccines, children in the developed world rarely die from the infection. But the disease is a killer in the developing world, where rehydration treatments are not widely available.The WHO estimates that worldwide, there are more than 25 million outpatient visits and two million hospitalizations each year due to rotavirus infections. Countries that have introduced the vaccine have reported sharp declines in rotavirus hospitalizations and deaths. Two vaccines are now available to protect children from rotavirus, the leading cause of severe diarrheal illness among babies and young children.SARS-CoV(Image credit: CDC/ Dr. Fred Murphy)The virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, was first identified in 2003 during an outbreak in China, according to the WHO. The virus likely emerged in bats initially, then hopped into nocturnal mammals called civets before finally infecting humans, according to the Journal of Virology. After triggering an outbreak in China, SARS spread to 26 countries around the world, infecting 8,096 people and killing more than 774 over the course of several months, according to the CDC.The disease causes fever, chills and body aches, and often progresses to pneumonia, a severe condition in which the lungs become inflamed and fill with pus. SARS has an estimated mortality rate of 9.6%, however, no new cases of SARS have been reported since the early 2000s, according to the CDC. SARS-CoV-2 This transmission electron microscope image shows SARS-CoV-2– the virus that causes COVID-19– isolated from a patient in the US. (Image credit: NIAID-RML)SARS-CoV-2 may not kill a huge fraction of the people it infects, but the disease caused by the virus, called COVID-19, has become the leading viral cause of death in since it exploded onto the scene in 2020. As of October 2022, the virus has caused more than 6.57 million deaths worldwide and counting, and has infected at least 626 million people, according to OurWorldInData.SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same large family of viruses as SARS-CoV, known as coronaviruses, and was first identified in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The virus may have originated in bats and passed through an intermediate animal before infecting people, according to a 2021 study in the journal Nature. The initial outbreak prompted an extensive quarantine of Wuhan and nearby cities, restrictions on travel to and from affected countries and a worldwide effort to develop diagnostics, treatments and vaccines. Estimating an infection fatality rate, or the fraction of people who die after being infected, is difficult, because many mild cases are never diagnosed. But age is clearly a huge factor in the virus' lethality: One study in the journal The Lancet estimated that the virus killed about 0.0023% of children under age 7 that it infected and about 20% of those infected over age 90.The virus also poses a higher risk to people who have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure or obesity, according to WHO. Common symptoms include fever, cough, loss of taste or smell and shortness of breath and more serious symptoms include breathing difficulties, chest pain and loss of mobility. Several COVID-19 vaccines, as well as booster doses for those vaccines, are currently approved for use in both children and adults. These vaccines dramatically reduce the odds of severe disease and death, according to the CDC.MERS-CoV An illustration of the MERS virus, a type of coronavirus. (Image credit: Shutterstock)The virus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, sparked an outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and another in South Korea in 2015. It has a high case fatality rate, killing about 35% of people diagnosed with it. But the virus has killed only 858 people as of 2021, because it does not spread easily between people. The MERS virus belongs to the same family of viruses as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. According to WHO, the disease infected camels before passing into humans and can trigger a fever, coughing and shortness of breath in infected people. MERS is deadly because, like its less lethal cousins SARS and SARS-CoV-2, it often progresses to severe pneumonia. There is no vaccine available to prevent this disease. The best way to reduce the chances of infection is to wash hands regularly, avoid contact with camels and not consume products containing raw animal milk.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article Influenza-associated hospitalization rates were nearly 80% higher among Black adults compared with white adults from 2009-2010 to 2021-2022, according to a CDC Vital Signs report released Tuesday. These rates were also 30% higher among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults and 20% higher among Hispanic adults compared with white adults, reported Carla L. Black, PhD, of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, and colleagues. Furthermore, vaccination coverage for influenza has been "consistently lower among Black, Hispanic, and American Indian and Alaska Native adults since 2010," she noted on a call with reporters. During the 2021-2022 flu season, vaccination coverage was lower among Hispanic (37.9%), AI/AN (40.9%), Black (42.0%), and other/multiple race (42.6%) adults compared with coverage among white (53.9%) and Asian (54.2%) adults, Black and team said. While the CDC recommends getting a flu vaccine every year, only about half of all Americans follow this advice, Black noted. "There are many reasons for disparities in vaccine uptake, including lack of access to healthcare and insurance, missed opportunities to vaccinate, and misinformation and distrust," she added. According to CDC estimates, influenza has resulted in 9 to 41 million illnesses, 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 to 52,000 deaths per year from 2010 to 2020. From 2009-2010 to 2021-2022 (excluding 2020-2021 data), the age-adjusted influenza-related hospitalization rates per 100,000 population were:Black adults: 78.2AI/AN adults: 54.6Hispanic adults: 50.3White adults: 43.0Asian or Pacific Islander: 34.5 Interestingly, during the 2011-2012 and 2021-2022 flu seasons, AI/AN adults were hospitalized for influenza more than any other racial group, with age-adjusted rates 2.7 times those in white adults, while these rates among Hispanic adults were 2.1 times that of white adults in 2009-2010 and 2021-2022. Looking broadly at trends in flu vaccine uptake from the 2010-2011 season through the 2021-2022 season, coverage rose from 40.5% to 49.4% and increased across all racial and ethnic groups, except for AI/AN adults. Between the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 flu seasons, coverage dipped by 0.8 percentage points overall, and fell 1.6 percentage points among white adults, while coverage remained "stable" from the 2018-2019 through the 2021-2022 flu seasons across all other racial and ethnic groups, the authors noted. Common Characteristics of Vaccinated Adults For the 2021-2022 flu season, vaccine uptake was higher among adults ages 65 and older compared with younger adults across all of the racial and ethnic groups studied. This was also the case for those with health insurance versus those without, those with a personal healthcare provider versus those without, and those who had had a routine medical checkup in the past year versus those who had not. Compared with white adults, Hispanic adults were less likely to have health insurance, and Hispanic, AI/AN, and multiracial adults and adults of other races were less likely to have a personal healthcare provider and to have had a medical check-up in the past year, the authors noted. Even among those adults who checked all these boxes, flu vaccine coverage was still higher among white adults compared with Black, Hispanic, AI/AN, and multiracial adults and adults of other races. Asked whether other factors beyond vaccination status might contribute to Black adults having the highest influenza-associated hospitalization rates, Black explained that "the presence of chronic illnesses contributes to more severe flu outcomes," and some racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to have chronic illnesses. She also noted that crowded housing conditions can also contribute to an individual's risk of hospitalization. The CDC is continuing to promote vaccination through public awareness campaigns, and encouraging healthcare providers to recommend flu vaccines to their patients and to use culturally appropriate materials that include images that reflect the community and are written in the predominant language of the community. In addition, programs such as Partnering for Vaccine Equity (P4VE) -- which "likely contributed to decreased disparities in COVID-19 vaccination" by using non-traditional settings, such as libraries, barbers shops, and thrifts stores -- might also help to mitigate disparities in influenza vaccination, Black and team wrote. Study Details The researchers sought to examine influenza disease severity and vaccination rates by race/ethnicity over a 12- to 13-year period, excluding 2020-2021 influenza-associated hospitalization data because "case counts during this season were too low to calculate rates by race and ethnicity," they noted. They used the Influenza-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), which tracks confirmed flu-related hospitalizations in certain states, representative of about 8% to 9% of the U.S. population. They also leveraged data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a telephone survey that collects information on a range of health conditions, including whether respondents received a flu vaccine in the past 12 months. Limitations to the study included that the FluSurv-NET may not be representative of the entire U.S. population, since it only tracks data in "selected counties." As for BRFSS data, "survey response rates were low and influenza vaccination coverage might differ between survey respondents and nonrespondents," Black and team noted.

Taylor Blake's family farm in South Florida, Knuckle Bump Farms, has lost more than 50 birds in just three days, Blake wrote on Twitter Saturday. Only two birds survived. "I am still trying to wrap my head around it," Blake wrote. "We thought we were out of the woods, when Emmanuel unexpectedly went down this past Wednesday." Emmanuel became a viral sensation for his behavior interrupting Blake's TikTok videos and attacking the phone while Blake was filming. Blake is looking for an avian specialist who can treat Emmanuel, who has suffered nerve damage in his right leg and foot, according to the Twitter thread. In the meantime, Blake posted a photo to Twitter of her helping Emmanuel start physical therapy using a homemade sling. Sponsor Message Not many people are aware of the dangers that wild birds pose to domesticated birds.Wild birds carry and transmit a deadly virus known as Avian Influenza.Our farm was heavily impacted by wild geese bringing in AI,and we lost 99%of the birds on our farm.— eco sister(@hiitaylorblake)October 15,2022 Blake announced on Monday she is not looking to do any interviews with news outlets, tweeting, "As much as I appreciate news stations reporting and elevating Emmanuel's story, the last thing on my mind right now is doing interviews. My best friend is fighting for his life, and I'm just doing my absolute best not to crumble into a million pieces." The H5N1 bird influenza has killed more than 45 million birds in the U.S. since the start of an outbreak in February, according to the Department of Agriculture. Scientists believe wild migratory birds brought the virus to North America at the beginning of the year and have spread the virus to more than 40 wild bird species. While chickens and turkeys with the virus quickly die, some waterfowl with the virus can remain healthy and carry it long distances. The flu strain historically has posed almost no risk to humans, but public experts remain concerned about the possibility that it could jump across species. "Because humans have no prior immunity to these viruses typically, if they were to be infected and spread the virus to other humans, then we could have another pandemic virus on our hands," Todd Davis, an expert on animal-to-human diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told NPR earlier this year. Sponsor Message The United Kingdom is also dealing with a bird flu outbreak — its largest ever — and declared an Aviation Influenza Prevention Zone on Monday, requiring bird keepers in Great Britain to follow strict biosecurity measures. Bird keepers in Great Britain will have to keep free-ranging birds within fenced areas and keep domestic ducks and geese separate from other poultry. Keepers also will need to regularly clean and disinfect their footwear.

The city has seen 900 cases of the flu within the first two weeks of October. Dr. Philip Keiser is the local health authority for Galveston County. He said the county does an annual flu surveillance program that starts in October. The program gathers two weekly reports. One is influenza-like illnesses where participating doctors see cases that look like influenza, and once checked off, gets reported back to Keiser and his team. The second report consists of positive flu tests, which gets added to the influenza-like illnesses. "So, the 900 cases that we're talking about are simply the positive flu test. When we add up the influenza like illnesses, there's about 1,000 more each week, so the numbers really are very, very shocking," Keiser said. Usually the numbers seen this time of year are typically "enough you can count on one hand," he said. "Usually you see five, ten in a week of positive cultures and the influenza-like illnesses because not all of them are flu. You may see only 20, 30," he said. Dr. Keiser said most people testing positive are adults. Keiser said the high numbers could be a combination of COVID and weaker immune systems. “I mean, I guess there are three possibilities. The number one is that people aren't taking the necessary precautions, I think that's a huge part of that," he said. "Because of that, people's immunity has waned. There's not that many people that have gotten the flu in the past couple of years. Just like COVID, if you don't get exposed to it, or you don't get a vaccine, your immunity wanes." "The third thing, which I don't think is the case at this point, is that it could be a strain. That's much more transmissible, and of course, we could see that from time to time."

Ireland Army Health Clinic officials are asking Fort Knox civilian employees and community members to be patient about getting flu vaccines until they can vaccinate Soldiers first. Community members will get their first opportunity at vaccines during the MWR-sponsored trunk-or-treat event called Balloween Oct. 28, 2022. (Photo Credit: Eric Pilgrim, Fort Knox News) VIEW ORIGINAL The flu season runs from October through April each year. According to Capt. Shantyl Galloway, officer in charge of the Fort Knox Vaccine Site, vaccine requirements are different depending on where you work. “The story is that the flu vaccine is mandatory for Soldiers,” said Galloway. As for civilian employees, Galloway said it varies. “For healthcare providers it’s a mandatory requirement to have the flu vaccine annually,” said Galloway. “Some civilian employees and contractors even have it written in their [position description], depending on what they do.” Galloway said Soldier readiness requirements guide to whom and in what order health officials administer the flu vaccines. Because Soldiers are the priority for readiness, they receive the shots first. Soldiers started receiving this year’s round of shots Oct. 1. “Some civilian staff have tried to come through at the same time we’re administering the shots to Soldiers, and I’ve had to turn them away,” said Galloway. Because of an abundance in flu shots delivered to the vaccine site this year, health officials decided to offer shots to retirees at the 2022 Retiree Appreciation Day Oct. 14, said Galloway. That is not always the case, however. “Every year we’re unsure if we will be able to provide that service at the retiree event,” said Galloway. “This year has been an outlier; we typically do not have our entire allotment at this time each year.” Galloway said they will offer the vaccine to civilian employees who are mandated to receive it from Oct. 24 and 25, 1-5 p.m. each day. The kickoff of flu vaccines for everybody else will occur Oct. 26, 3-6 p.m. Flu vaccines will also be offered at the Fort Knox Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation’s trunk-or-treat event Oct. 28, called Balloween. That will be held at Caruso Youth Sports Complex, beginning at 6 p.m. Otherwise, community members can get their flu shots at the Fort Knox Vaccine Site, Ireland Army Health Clinic, or off post where available. Galloway said those who do decide to get their shots off post are asked to bring a record of their vaccine into her staff, or to school staff for students who are required to get their shots.

In rare cases, handling infected birds can enable the virus to jump to people. Get more newsLiveonOct. 18, 2022, 12:04 AM UTCBy Aria Bendix and Angela YangAfter TikTok user Taylor Blake shared photos of herself snuggling with Emmanuel the emu, who is sick with avian influenza, fans and bird flu experts alike warned of the dangers of touching infected animals.Blake’s videos of Emmanuel went viral this year, getting millions of views on TikTok and boosting the emu's celebrity. But Blake announced Saturday that Emmanuel had fallen ill after a flock of wild Egyptian geese visited Knuckle Bump Farms, the hobby farm in South Florida where the emu lives. Geese and other types of waterfowl are carriers of avian influenza and can pass the virus through saliva, mucus and droppings.Blake said on Twitter that the virus killed 99% of the birds on her farm, including chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, female black swans and other emus popular with its TikTok followers. Her recent photos show her hand-feeding Emmanuel, giving him fluids and kissing him on the head. The images and updates prompted some followers to point out that although Emmanuel’s illness is worrisome, it’s also alarming to see the emu and his caretaker cuddling, given the dangers of the virus. "Look we all love Emmanuel the Emu but he has avian flu. It’s transmissible to humans and other animals," a Twitter user wrote. "And it’s deadly. The absolute last thing his owners, with other birds and animals in their care, should be doing is kissing his face."Avian flu experts, too, said touching an infected emu isn't advisable, given that the virus can jump from animals to humans in rare cases. "Keeping [Emmanuel] away from humans and other birds or mammals would be probably the most responsible behavior," said Nichola Hill, an ecologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston.Blake didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. She told her followers Sunday that her farm is in a 150-day quarantine, with strict sanitation procedures, including hand- and foot-washing before and after contact with the animals. She said that Emmanuel is "completely isolated" but that she doesn't wear a mask around him because he "freaks out" and she doesn't want to add more stress.The farm has "been fully compliant with the state," she wrote.H5N1, the bird flu strain currently spreading, is highly contagious among birds, and it can be deadly to them. It's also spreading to more places and affecting a greater diversity of species than past outbreaks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 47 million poultry birds and nearly 3,000 wild birds have been infected across 46 states since January. Cases have also been recorded in red foxes, bobcats, otters, skunks and a dolphin."It’s spilling over in all kinds of different species, including mammals, which gives me a little pause for humans," said Maurice Pitesky, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. "Once an avian virus can move to mammals, now we’re in the realm of 'Yeah, we better be careful.'"Experts said that the risk of a caretaker's getting avian influenza from a single animal is low but that the virus regularly mutates and that it could evolve to get better at jumping to humans over time. Two recent cases of H5N1 have been documented in people: an asymptomatic person in England who raised birds and an inmate in Colorado who'd been culling poultry."Historically, we’ve actually never had a transmission directly from a wild bird to a human, so if it did actually shift or transmit from the emu to its owner, who's clearly very affectionate with it, that would be a first," Hill said.Dr. Jim Wellehan, an associate professor at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, has pet emus of his own. He said some evidence suggests H5N1 is spreading more through feces than through respiratory droplets. But even so, Wellehan said, "that’s not to suggest that it’s ever a good idea to go snuggle up with a bird with a virus."If people must have contact with infected animals, he added, they should wear personal protective equipment, like masks and gloves. Pitesky recommended that everyone working closely with poultry get their flu shots, as well.All three experts said scientists are watching this bird flu closely even though the risk to humans is low."There’s eyes on this virus because it’s considered a pandemic risk, which means that if it could ever gain the ability to transmit from human to human, we’d be in trouble," Hill said.

It’s not worth the health risks, the experts we talked to said. Update: The bird's owner said that Emmanuel never had bird flu.By by Katie CameroBuzzFeed News ReporterUpdated on October 18, 2022, 9:03 pmPosted on October 18, 2022, 1:16 pmTwitterFacebookLink Maddie Abuyuan / BuzzFeed News; @hiitaylorblake on Twitter Update: Since publication, the bird's owner said that Emmanuel never had bird flu. A separate article on the update has been published.One of TikTok’s favorite birds, the beloved Emmanuel the emu, has a life-threatening case of avian influenza. However, virologists and animal handlers have raised concerns about how the owner is dealing with the sick bird.Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza type A viruses that naturally spread among wild birds, such as ducks, geese, vultures, and hawks, and can infect domesticated poultry, such as chickens, turkeys, and ducks. People don’t normally contract bird flu viruses, but if they do, infections can sometimes be fatal.When a virus jumps from birds to humans, the concern is that the germ could undergo genetic changes and spread more easily from person to person, setting the stage for a flu pandemic. (Although the current threat to humans is considered to be low, according to the CDC.)Taylor Blake, who works on Knuckle Bump Farms in South Florida, has 2.4 million followers on TikTok and posts videos of Emmanuel and other animals in an effort to teach people about farm life.On Saturday, Oct. 15, however, Blake revealed on Twitter that she lost over 50 birds in just three days following what she believes was the introduction of avian influenza via wild Egyptian geese. The wild birds would fly into her farm every night, she said. Domesticated birds can get sick by coming into contact with contaminated saliva, nasal secretions, and feces from other infected birds; Blake mentioned that state officials believe the excess standing water from Hurricane Ian “made the virus more rampant.” Dr. Angela Rasmussen @angie_rasmussen If your emu (or any bird) has avian influenza, do not kiss it. Do not cuddle with it. Do not touch it. Bird flu is extremely dangerous to humans and other animals. And it sounds harsh but to prevent it’s spread, birds that get avian flu should be euthanized. 08:40 PM - 16 Oct 2022 Reply Retweet Favorite Twitter: @angie_rasmussen Bird flu is typically separated into two categories: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), which causes little to no symptoms in birds, and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) — strains that are extremely contagious and deadly to birds, which are likely responsible for the colossal loss at Blake’s farm.HPAI has been spreading in Europe for about a year and recently made its way to Canada. It was detected for the first time in Florida in January and has since been found in several other states, including Kentucky, New York, Virginia, Delaware, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, and Nebraska. Emmanuel is one of the last remaining birds at the Florida farm and is currently fighting for his life, Blake said.“I cannot even begin to express the guttural feeling of watching innocent animals die,” Blake tweeted. “[Emmanuel] has a long road ahead, but I know in my heart that God is healing him. I know all of this won’t be in vain.”As tragic as the loss is, infectious disease experts can’t help but cringe at the photos Blake has shared of her cuddling, kissing, and handling a sickly Emmanuel — the only surviving emu on the farm — without protective equipment. Some experts are questioning why Blake said she attempted to save some of her animals, which in this scenario should be euthanized to prevent further spread.In her defense, Blake says she can’t wear a mask because it stresses the bird and that she’s taking other steps, including sanitizing her hands, clothes, and body, as well as quarantining on the farm.Typically during outbreaks of bird flu, millions of domestic poultry are euthanized to stop the spread of the viruses. This year’s outbreak is the worst in North America since 2014-2015, when 50 million chickens and turkeys in the US either died or were culled to stop the spread of the disease. Doug Reed, Ph.D. 🔬🦠🤒⚽🎮 @DougSReed @angie_rasmussen Cuddling, kissing, or touching an infected animal that has avian influenza is horrifying on so many levels. 01:39 PM - 17 Oct 2022 Reply Retweet Favorite Twitter: @DougSReed Douglas Reed, an associate professor of immunology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who studies avian influenza, told us that H5N1 viruses — the strain that's currently circulating in US wild birds and poultry — “have been on our radar for a long time as a potential pandemic virus.”Close contact with sick birds in the way that Blake is handling Emmanuel is not recommended.“Fortunately there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission, but with every exposure we risk that the virus could adapt to spread more easily human-to-human,” Reed wrote in an email. “Handling or close contact with infected animals without use of appropriate personal protective equipment accentuates that risk, as we do not have a good understanding of how avian influenza viruses transmit from birds to humans.“Of course, I also feel compassion for the individuals involved in this particular story; it is heartbreaking to have a pet become ill and potentially die (or need to be euthanized) from a serious disease,” Reed continued. “But in this instance the risks to the humans involved, and to the rest of us, also has to be weighed.”Kirsten Lie-Nielsen, author and homesteader at Hostile Valley Farm in Maine, said she feels Blake's attempts to save Emmanuel are "unforgivably selfish" due to the extremely contagious nature of the virus. As someone who had to cull her own flock this spring because of avian influenza, Lie-Nielsen feels it's not fair to risk the virus spreading to other farms just because of one emu."This virus is highly contagious within poultry, and can be spread by wild birds that stop by Emmanuel's farm or by visitors to the farm on their boots or clothes. That puts other people's flocks at risk," Lie-Nielsen wrote in an email. "I completely understand Blake's adoration for her bird. I adored my birds. My heart goes out to her. But there is no good reason why Emmanuel gets to 'recover' when others have lost their friends forever — and his recovery puts even more birds at risk."And that is to say nothing of poultry farms affected where a family's entire livelihood is destroyed," she wrote. "Why is Emmanuel different?"Poultry infected with bird flu are usually culled (euthanized) to prevent further spread, the CDC says, but Reed said it's possible an exception was made in Blake's case because it appears Emmanuel was isolated from other birds "and was not a (literal) flight risk." Still, he said "it's rather extraordinary that culling didn't happen in this case."It's also "unusual" for a bird to survive H5N1 infection, Reed said. "Because they’re typically culled, I don’t know how soon a bird would be considered ‘cured’ (virus negative)." One 2010 study found that H5N1 persisted in duck feathers for as long as 5 months.But "how long it is until the animal is truly virus free," Reed said, "we don’t yet know."How bird flu spreads and what to know about your personal risk at this timePeople can contract bird flu by touching their mouth, eyes, or nose after prolonged, close, and unprotected contact with infected birds’ saliva, feces, or bodily fluids, according to the CDC. The virus can also become aerosolized in droplets or dust, so it’s possible to get infected via inhalation, as well.Not everyone who gets infected experiences symptoms, but those who do may feel mild illness, such as sore throat, eye redness, runny nose, body aches, headaches, and fatigue. More serious conditions are possible, too, like pneumonia, that require hospitalization. Fever is not guaranteed; meanwhile, other less common symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, or seizures.Person-to-person spread is incredibly rare, the CDC says, but even when it has happened, it hasn’t led to further spread among people. Since 2003, 19 countries have reported “rare, sporadic human infections” with H5N1 bird flu viruses, but no known events have occurred with the H5N1 virus circulating in US birds at this time. Tom Peacock @PeacockFlu Thread of avian influenza virus (AIV). First off a PSA - DO NOT touch, handle or attempt to treat suspected sick or dead birds yourself - particularly poultry, waterfowl (ducks, geese, etc) or seabirds. These are VERY dangerous viruses that can infect people and be deadly! 12:07 PM - 16 Oct 2022 Reply Retweet Favorite Twitter: @PeacockFlu The best way to prevent infection, the CDC says, is to avoid exposure from the start. If that’s not possible, the use of gloves, medical-grade face masks, and eye protection is an absolute must. Otherwise, it’s important to wash your hands with soap and water and change your clothes after touching or handling wild birds.Only two infections in humans with the currently circulating H5N1 bird flu viruses have been reported. The first occurred in December 2021 in an asymptomatic person in the UK who raised birds. The second — and the only case reported in the US — was confirmed in Colorado in April in a person who was culling (eliminating) infected poultry and whose only symptoms included fatigue. (Just four people have contracted LPAI viruses in the US.)Globally, a total of 863 infections and 455 deaths caused by H5N1 have been reported since 2003, according to an alert posted in January by the World Health Organization.The good news is that the current risk to the general public is low, the CDC says. (Although people with job-related or recreational exposures to birds may face higher risks of infection and are advised to take appropriate precautions.)Equally as positive is the fact that the latest H5N1 viruses in the US do not carry the same mutations as past strains that allowed them to spread faster among poultry and infect people more easily, the CDC says.“The detections of H5 viruses in wild birds, poultry and in one person in the United States do not change the risk to the general public’s health, which CDC considers to be low,” the agency says on its website. “Right now, the H5N1 bird flu situation remains primarily an animal health issue. However, CDC is watching this situation closely and taking routine preparedness and prevention measures in case this virus changes to pose a greater human health risk.”The agency notes that if multiple reports of H5N1 infections in people emerge across the US, or if person-to-person spread is occurring, then it may be time to consider avian influenza a public health risk.In the meantime, you should avoid handling dead or sick birds. If you must, the CDC recommends wearing disposable gloves and using an inverted plastic bag over your hand when picking up a dead bird. You can also help reduce the virus’s spread among wild birds by regularly cleaning your bird feeders with a 10% bleach solution.If you are exposed to bird flu, you should isolate yourself from others until you recover. You can also take flu antiviral drugs that can help protect you from severe illness with avian influenza; these work best if taken soon after symptoms begin. Some evidence shows that flu antivirals aren’t as effective against some H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, which are another type of avian flu that can cause sporadic outbreaks in humans.Flu shots can also reduce your risk of getting seriously ill with bird flu viruses, although they can’t prevent infection, the CDC says.

Brown/AFP via Getty Images, FILERacial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be hospitalized with the flu in the United States, new federal data shows.A new report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuesday looked at data from the 2009-10 through the 2021-22 flu seasons – excluding the 2020-21 season – and flu vaccination coverage from the 2010-11 season through the 2021-22 season.MORE: What Australia's flu season could foreshadow in the US this fallThey found that compared to white adults, influenza-related hospitalizations were 80% higher among Black adults.Although there was some variation by season, during most season, hospitalization rates for Black adults were between 1.5 and 2.4 times the rates among white adults.Additionally, American Indian and Alaska Natives (Ai/AN) flu-related hospitalizations were 30% higher and hospitalizations among Hispanics were 20% higher.Flu Hospitalizations in the U.S. by Race/EthnicityABC News Photo Illustration, CDCFor AI/AN adults, rates were highest during the 2011-12 season and the 2021-22 seasons with rates 2.7 times those of white adults.Meanwhile for Hispanics, the highest rates were seen during the 2009-10 and 2021-22 seasons and were 2.1 times those of their white counterparts.The report also found that Asian/Pacific Islander adults had the lowest rates of hospitalization of all the racial and ethnic groups, ranging from 60% to 90% of hospitalization rates of white adults.Although experts say flu vaccination is the best protection against the flu, rates are lower among racial and ethnic minorities."Every year, the flu continues to cause severe illness hospitalization and death," said CDC Acting Principal Deputy Director Dr. Debra Houry in a press briefing to reporters Tuesday.MORE: Flu cases on the rise as US prepares for possibly severe season, data shows"Unfortunately, flu vaccination rates have been consistently lower among black, Hispanic, and American Indian, Alaska Native adults in the United States since 2010."During the 2021-22 season, 49.4% of white adults were vaccinated against flu. By comparison, just 42% of Black adults, 37.9% of Hispanic minorities and 40.9% of AI/AN adults were vaccinated.Asian and Pacific Islander adults had the highest rate of vaccination at 54.2%.According to the CDC, there are several reasons for racial and ethnic disparities, including lack of access to health care and insurance, which in turn leads to less vaccine access.Another reason for the disparities is missed opportunities to vaccinate."For adults who reported a recent medical checkup, vaccination coverage was still lower for Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Alaska Native and adults of other races than for white adults," Dr. Carla Black, an epidemiologist from the CDC's Immunization Services Division, said during the press conference. "This suggests that health care providers are missing opportunities during routine medical appointments to vaccinate people from certain groups."She added there may be misinformation about how serious flu is and vaccine safety as well as distrust due to past racist health policies that have negatively affected America's communities of color.A sign announces free flu vaccines outside a CVS pharmacy, Jan. 14, 2022, in Monterey Park, Calif.Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images, FILECDC officials recommend that doctors encourage their patients, including those of color, to get the flu shot and that public health officials host outreach evens including town halls and pop-up clinics to increase turs tans access to flu vaccines.Black also encouraged flu vaccination due to the risk of a potentially severe flu season this year after the U.S. had two years of little to no flu activity:"Well, what we can so far is that we've had mild flu season, and this means we might be ripe for a severe season, because people are not, you know taking all the measures they took for COVID which also had an impact on flu like masking and social distancing," she said. "People haven't had natural disease in two years. So, you know, there's less natural immunity out there. People are going back to work. People are traveling again; all of these factors could contribute to us having a more severe flu season."Related TopicsFlu SeasonPopular ReadsCalifornia fire grows over 20,000 acresNov 7, 9:47 PMSeattle stabbings: 10 attacked in 2 daysNov 8, 7:04 PMMissing American tourist in Hungary killed: PoliceNov 9, 1:36 PMFEMA probing supervisor over Trump sign orderNov 9, 3:46 PM538's final forecasts for the 2024 electionNov 5, 7:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC News'Influenza is here': Flu shots open for Albertans as virus circulates | Calgary HeraldSkip to Content Mix up your morning routine!

Below we dispel five common myths that discourage some people from getting the flu vaccine, putting themselves and their loved ones at risk. Myth 1: I’m healthy, so I don’t need a flu shot. Even healthy people die of influenza. In fact, approximately 50 percent of children who die from the flu each year were previously healthy, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While the flu can cause some of the symptoms we are familiar with, such as high fever, body aches and fatigue, it can also cause pneumonia, sepsis (a life-threatening response to infection) and organ failure. The risk of suffering a heart attack or a stroke also increases in the weeks following a flu infection. “We are all potentially at risk for developing dangerous complications from the flu. Everyone who is eligible — even healthy people — should get vaccinated,” says Gretchen LaSalle, MD, a family medicine physician at MultiCare Rockwood Clinic. Myth 2: I can get the flu from the flu shot. The flu shot cannot cause the flu because it is made from inactivated, or dead, viruses. While the flu nasal spray does contain live viruses, they are weakened so they cannot transmit an infection to someone with a healthy immune system. “It takes two weeks for the vaccine to offer protection, and during that time, people can and sometimes do actually catch the flu,” Dr. LaSalle says. “That’s why it is important to get the vaccine before flu season begins.” Some people may also experience mild side effects from the vaccine, such as a low-grade fever or muscle aches, that can be mistaken for flu symptoms. Myth 3: The flu vaccine doesn’t really work. It’s true that you may still get the flu despite being vaccinated, but you are less likely to experience a severe form of the illness. “Getting the flu vaccine is similar to wearing a seatbelt. While a seatbelt doesn’t guarantee you won’t get into a car accident, it will help protect you from serious harm if you do,” Dr. LaSalle says. “That’s what the flu vaccine does best — it prevents hospitalizations and deaths from influenza.” Myth 4: I can just build up my immunity naturally. “Flu viruses mutate, or change, so frequently that having had the flu one year does not provide protection against it the following year, so it’s not possible to develop immunity. That’s why it’s important to get the flu shot annually,” Dr. LaSalle says. Getting vaccinated is also a safer choice than being exposed naturally to the virus because flu infections carry a risk of serious health complications. Myth 5: I can’t get a flu shot because I have an egg allergy. People with egg allergies can still be vaccinated. However, if you have a history of severe allergic reactions to eggs, such as vomiting or anaphylaxis, it’s best to get a flu shot in a medical clinic rather than a pharmacy. “Physicians and other health care providers are trained to recognize these life-threatening allergic responses and treat them,” Dr. LaSalle says. “Another option is to ask for an egg-free alternative. There are two vaccine brands currently available that are not developed using eggs.” Get vaccinated The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older, including pregnant people, get a flu vaccine every year unless otherwise instructed by your physician. The ideal time to get vaccinated is early fall before flu season begins. You can even get the latest COVID-19 shot the same time as your flu vaccine.

New antigen tests are capable of differentiating between the twoAs the autumn-winter season approaches and the influenza virus has regained seasonality, new diagnostic kits have the ability to detect both diseases at the same time Mariano ZafraPablo LindeOct 20, 2022 - 17:43CESTWhatsappFacebookTwitterLinkedinCopy linkCovid-19 or the flu? Although the symptoms of both viruses are practically indistinguishable from each other, as of this autumn it will be possible to tell the difference. For the first time since the coronavirus pandemic swept across the globe in early 2020, pharmacies are now stocked with tests that are capable of detecting both Covid-19 and influenza. These antigen tests are almost identical to the ones that have become so familiar during the pandemic, but now they are also able to detect the flu virus separately. The autumn-winter season in 2022 in the Northern Hemisphere will arrive with both pathogens hand in hand, something has not yet occurred since the beginning of the pandemic. It has already happened in the Southern Hemisphere, where influenza has returned to a seasonality – albeit somewhat earlier than would usually be the case – that it had temporarily lost due to the interference of Covid-19 and the measures put in place to curb its spread.In Spain – and it can be extrapolated therefore in Europe in general – the latest data suggests something similar will happen. The epidemiological bulletins produced by the Ministry of Health place the incidence rate of both pathogens at a practically equal level. Infections have been on the rise, moderately but steadily, for a little over three weeks. The procedure for the combined antigen tests is the same as that for Covid-19 tests: a sample is taken from either the nose or mouth, depending on the type of test purchased, using the swab provided and then mixed with the solution included in the diagnostic kit. From there, there are two different kinds of test kit, one with two small receptacles in which to place the sample – one for Covid-19 and one for flu – and another that has just one. In both cases, the red line determines whether coronavirus or flu (types A and B) antigens have been detected. The active cycle of both viruses has a similar duration: they take between one and four days to incubate, and the infection generally lasts for between eight and 10 days. María del Mar Tomás of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology notes that antigen tests are very reliable in people who return a positive result, but not so much when the result is negative. “There could have been an error when collecting the sample, the virus may still be in the incubation period or the viral load could be insufficient,” she says. As such, the expert recommends that people who are displaying symptoms compatible with both diseases should observe basic precautions so as not to risk infecting other people, particularly the elderly and people with immune system problems, who are most at risk of being hospitalized or dying from Covid-19 or the flu.As things stand, there is nothing to suggest that either Covid-19 or the flu will be more severe on this occasion than during previous waves, during which fatality and hospitalization rates have been much lower than during the early stages of the pandemic. If the Omicron variant continues to behave in the same way as it has up to now, it is foreseeable that transmission rates will be high, but that there will not be as significant an impact on public healthcare systems as in 2020 and 2021.At the moment, the predominant strain is the same one that caused the seventh Covid-19 wave: BA.5, a subvariant of Omicron, although others have been detected that could replace it. Studies published so far refer back to the original Omicron strain; one from July shows that antigen tests were still returning positive results in the majority of infected people (83%) five days after the first symptoms emerged. Over time, that number drops. In a majority of cases, the infection disappears after eight to 10 days, but 13% of people still remained positive after that timeline had elapsed. In general, a positive test result is correlated to the ability to infect other people, something that should be taken into account when taking a test.Another study published in October examined the most frequent symptoms among a group of 3,000 people who tested positive for Omicron. These were: coughs (67%), a sore throat (43%), nasal congestion (39%), and headaches (35%). The least recorded were loss of smell (5%) and diarrhea (5%).The new tests make it possible to determine if these symptoms are being caused by Covid-19 or flu. Beyond the curiosity factor, this could prove to be important for older patients or those with immune deficiencies, who can proceed with one course of treatment or another depending on the illness, says Roger Paredes, head of the infectious diseases department at the Hospital Trias i Pujol in Badalona, Catalonia. For the rest of the population, precautions to avoid infecting other people should be the same in both instances, particularly in the case of the most vulnerable.

Advertisement Emmanuel, the TikTok-famous emu, has contracted avian influenza, his caretaker Taylor Blake shared to Twitter on Saturday.According to Blake, Emmanuel fell ill after a flock of wild Egyptian geese visited her farm, Knuckle Bump Farms in southern Florida. Shortly after, said Blake, she lost over 50 birds over the course of three days in a "massive tragedy" to the virus — including every chicken, duck, and goose.Emmanuel is one of two survivors of the virus that ran through the farm, though after thinking they were "out of the woods," the emu unexpectedly also showed symptoms on Wednesday.Emmanuel first gained the attention of TikTokers when he pecked at his owner's phone in an early @knucklebumpfarms educational video, which would become a theme of Blake's TikTok account. A July 8 TikTok of Emmanuel peering close to Blake's phone — seemingly about to peck, as Blake says "Emmanuel, don't do it!" — has been viewed over 13 million times. Knuckle Bump's TikTok account has more than 2.4 million TikTok followers and videos of Emmanuel figure prominently on its account. Advertisement @knucklebumpfarms Not a day goes by that Emanuel doesn’t try my life #emu #emusoftiktok #farmlife ♬ original sound - Knuckle Bump Farms Since first announcing his illness, Blake has posted some positive updates. A vet was able to "sedate and stabilize" the emu, and Blake and her girlfriend created a sling for Emmanuel to begin physical therapy. On Sunday, she told followers that she left the emu in one position, but returned to find him sitting up and facing the opposite direction later in the day. Related stories "HE REPOSITIONED HIMSELF, BY HIMSELF! This is huge!" — she tweeted. Later that day, she shared that Emmanuel drank water on his own for the first time since becoming ill.EMMANUEL JUST DRANK WATER BY HIMSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE BECOMING ILL😭🥹 Please keep the prayers coming! pic.twitter.comieSFKtkFB— eco sister (@hiitaylorblake) October 16, 2022 But Emmanuel's condition still appears to be touch-and-go. On October 17, Blake said Emmanuel's neck was "presenting a bit twisted," a condition reportedly common in baby emus, but said that her avian specialist had never dealt with "wry neck" in adults. Blake tweeted a plea for help to Bindi, Robert, and Terri Irwin, offering to pay to fly anyone to the farm to help save her emu. "He needs someone experienced in physical therapy," she wrote. "I am also open to any other methods of treatment: acupuncture, UV therapy, chiropractic, hydrotherapy, etc. I just need someone with expertise. PLEASE HELP."

TikTok's favorite emu Emmanuel is unable to eat or drink on his own after contracting the avian flu. From @hiitaylorblake/Twitter CNN — Emmanuel, the emu who won viral fame on TikTok for his attention-grabbing behavior, is in dire condition after contracting the avian influenza, according to his owner. CNN previously reported on the emu, who rose to fame after his owner, Taylor Blake, began posting videos documenting life on her small farm, Knuckle Bump Farms, in south Florida. Emmanuel repeatedly interrupted Blake’s videos of other animals to peck at the camera and garnered millions of views in the process. @knucklebumpfarms Must-watch videos of the week Blake posted a lengthy Twitter thread Saturday, in which she described the “massive tragedy” caused by an avian flu outbreak at her farm. Wild geese flying onto the farm transmitted the virus, she said. More than fifty of her birds, including three emus, died over the course of three days. Then, on Wednesday, Emmanuel also contracted the illness, she wrote. “Currently, he is stable. His neurological symptoms have subsided but he still won’t eat or drink on his own,” she wrote. “I am hand feeding him & giving him subcutaneous fluids every 2hrs around the clock. “He is a fighter and I wholeheartedly believe he is going to make a full recovery.” Lucas Peterson posted two videos of his pet frog, enlarged with video editing, that gathered millions of views and attracted confused comments about whether or not the animal's size was real. Courtesy Lucas Peterson Dumpy, the giant frog that went viral on TikTok, is actually fake -- well, kinda The emu is suffering from nerve damage in his right leg and foot, Blake said. Blake posted snapshots of the sling she and her girlfriend engineered to help him regain function in the leg. Emmanuel and a swan named Rico, are now the only birds left on the farm, Blake wrote. The facility is also home to cows, deer, and pigs, among other animals. “I’ve taken time to process and grieve as much as possible, while also dedicating all of my time to the animals and their well-being,” she wrote. “It’s hard to grieve when so many lives depend on you.” A highly contagious strain of avian influenza has been confirmed in wild birds in 32 counties in Florida since January 2022, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. Almost 50 million poultry have been affected by the disease as of Friday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Here's what we know about this year's flu shot.The number of flu cases could be higher this season than what we've seen earlier in the pandemicCBC Radio · Posted: Oct 01, 2022 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: October 21, 2022Pharmacist Shivali Sharma administers a flu shot. As flu season approaches, pharmacists say they are fielding questions about the rollout of flu shots that will coincide this year with the availability of new COVID-19 vaccines targeting Omicron strains. (Emily Fitzpatrick/CBC)Social SharingThe Dose17:04What do I need to know about this year’s flu shot?Experts say it's almost time to roll up your sleeve for the annual flu shot. But this year, some pharmacists say people have questions about the influenza vaccine rollout, which will coincide with the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines that target Omicron strains — also known as bivalent vaccines.Ashley Davidson, a pharmacist and associate owner of Shoppers Drug Mart in St. Albert, Alta., has fielded a lot of questions."So many people are asking about flu shots and I think a lot of that conversation comes around how do they time their vaccines and what does that look like?" she told Dr. Brian Goldman, host of CBC's podcast The Dose. Here's what experts have to say about this year's flu vaccines. What do we know about the upcoming flu season?The number of flu cases this year could look a little different than what we've seen over the last few years."What has changed in the last two years is we had historical lows throughout the pandemic and we've now been in the time of uncertainty about when is it going to come back, what is it going to look like," said Dr. Robyn Harrison, vice-chair of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) and infectious disease specialist, on Wednesday during a webinar on seasonal influenza.AnalysisWe're close to cold and flu season. So, what does that look like with COVID-19 in the mix?Quebec could be in for a severe flu season, officials and experts sayAn example of what could come is Australia's recent flu season, which happens before Canada's because it is in the southern hemisphere.The country recently had its worst season in years, with data from Australia's Department of Health and Aged Care showing influenza infections were higher than the five-year average and infections notably spiked, then dropped, earlier than usual. Canadians also haven't had much exposure to flu over the last couple of years because of mask mandates and other public health measures introduced during the pandemic, Davidson said."One thing that stands out to me this year is that we won't have masks in schools. So that is going to increase the potential exposure for flu virus for children as well," she said. Flu season has officially arrived in Waterloo region with 2 lab-confirmed casesAccording to experts, influenza is a serious illness. Up until 2019, it is estimated that there are on average 12,000 hospital stays in Canada due to influenza every year, and about 3,500 deaths each year are caused by the flu, Harrison said.Influenza is very contagious and spreads by respiratory droplets which cause an infection. Symptoms can vary but commonly include fever, sore throat, runny nose, cough, fatigue and muscle aches.Who is eligible for a flu shot?Experts say it's important to get a flu shot each year as vaccine-induced immunity does wane over time. There are three types of influenza vaccines approved in Canada, according to NACI: Inactivated influenza vaccine Recombinant influenza vaccines Live attenuated influenza vaccine Anyone six months of age or older who does not have a known negative reaction to the vaccine should get a flu shot every year. "The reason why children under six months of age are not included in that is because we know that they don't mount a good immune response to influenza vaccines," said Dr. Jesse Papenburg, a pediatric infectious disease and medical microbiology specialist, during Wednesday's webinar. He is also the chair of the NACI influenza working group. A health-care worker prepares a flu shot in Calgary. According to experts, it's important to get a flu shot each year as vaccine-induced immunity does wane over time. (Leah Hennel)He said the suggested flu shot schedule for children nine and older and adults is one dose of the influenza vaccine at the beginning of flu season. For kids aged six months to eight years who have yet to receive a flu shot, NACI recommends two doses given at least four weeks apart. Who shouldn't get a flu shot?Papenburg said NACI recommendations for those who shouldn't get any of the flu shots include: People who have had an anaphylactic reaction to any of the vaccine's components, except for eggs. People who have developed Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) within six weeks of a previous flu vaccine (unless another cause has been found). Infants under six months of age. NACI's recommendations on who shouldn't get the live attenuated influenza vaccine can be found here. When should I get a flu shot?Davidson recommends that people get the influenza vaccine as soon as it's available.Doctors advise Ontarians to keep up with vaccines ahead of fall flu season, possible COVID-19 surgeHealth officials offer free flu shots to dampen potential fall influenza and COVID-19 surgeCanada's flu season typically lasts from mid-October to April or early May, Davidson said. "I will often remind patients that although you can get your flu shot right away, it does take about two weeks to develop an immune response to that vaccination," she said. "It is important to get your shot as soon as you can to ensure that you have coverage through the flu season."Can I get a flu shot and a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time?For most people, the short answer is yes.For people age five and older, all seasonal influenza vaccines, including the live-attenuated influenza vaccine, may be given at the same time or before or after other vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, according to the most recent recommendations from NACI. "It is important that you're protected from both viruses throughout the winter," said Davidson. WATCH | Experts break down what to expect from flu season this year: However, kids aged six months to five years shouldn't receive a COVID-19 vaccine and an influenza shot at the same time, according to NACI, which instead recommends those in this age group wait 14 days between COVID-19 shots and other vaccines.It's a precautionary approach "to prevent erroneous attribution of adverse events following immunization to one particular vaccine or the other," reads the committee's advice. How effective are flu vaccines this year?Experts say influenza vaccines have been proven to help prevent influenza, transmission, complications and hospitalizations. The effectiveness of flu vaccines can vary year-to-year because it all depends on the strains circulating, Davidson and Harrison said. New Brunwick braces for flu seasonFor the 2004-2005 flu season to 2019-20, Harrison said the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in Canada has varied between around 40 to 70 per cent. Every year, World Health Organization (WHO) experts make recommendations on which strains of the influenza virus should be targeted by the vaccines. This year, WHO recommended three influenza strains — one influenza A (H1N1); one influenza A (H3N2) and one influenza B — for inclusion in the trivalent flu shot. Although the flu vaccine's effectiveness can vary, both Harrison and Davidson agree that it does offer protection. "The effectiveness of the vaccine may not be 100 per cent and may not persist beyond a year, but has impact and that's why it's recommended," Harrison said.Written and produced by Stephanie DuboisAdd some “good” to your morning and evening.A vital dose of the week's news in health and medicine, from CBC Health.

Continue Cancel Health Minorities More Likely to Be Hospitalized With Flu, CDC Says Vaccine rate is also lower in Black, Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native adults By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published October 19, 2022 Juan Carlos Lucas/NurPhoto Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Each year the flu sends hundreds of thousands of American adults to the hospital, and a new report finds that people of color are much more likely tha﻿n whites to make those visits. Between 2009 and 2022, hospitalization rates were nearly 80 percent higher among Black adults than white adults, a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found. And rates were 30 percent higher among American Indian/Alaska Native adults and 20 percent higher Hispanics, compared to their white counterparts. The findings, published Oct. 18, come ahead of what some experts are predicting could be a particularly bad year for the flu. After two relatively tame years, thanks in large part to pandemic precautions that helped to cut down on the spread of respiratory illnesses, including influenza, “we might be ripe for a severe season,” Carla Black, a CDC epidemiologist, said during a briefing with reporters. Flu vaccinations lag, while inequities persist Health experts say one of the best ways to avoid winding up in the hospital with the flu is to get the annual flu shot. It may not safeguard against an﻿y infection, but it can make symptoms less severe if you do catch the bug. Still, only about half of adults in the U.S. typically roll up their sleeves for the shot, CDC data shows. And flu vaccination coverage has been consistently lower among Black, Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native adults in the last several years. Fewer than 43 percent of adults in these groups got the flu shot during the 2021–2022 flu season, compared to 54 percent of white adults. Explanations for these inequities run the gamut, the report’s authors note. Lack of health insurance and vaccine misinformation play a role — two factors that have also had damaging effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. And “lack of access to culturally competent providers and negative experiences with the health﻿ care system are still barriers for many people from certain racial and ethnic minority groups,” Black said. Even those who have access to health care may be slipping through the cracks. Among adults who reported a recent medical checkup, vaccination coverage was still lower for racial and ethnic minorities than for white adults, Black said. “This suggests that health care providers are missing opportunities during routine medical appointments to vaccinate people from certain groups,” she added. AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Subscribe See All Newsletters Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT What’s more, the CDC notes that racism and prejudice are also known to worsen inequalities. “Improving access to and trust in flu vaccines among people is critical to help reduce inequities,” CDC Acting Principal Deputy Director Debra Houry, M.D., said. Lower vaccination rates may be contributing to the disparities seen in hospitalization rates, the CDC says. It’s likely chronic diseases, some of which are more common in certain minority populations, also play a role. Conditions like asthma, diabetes and obesity can increase the risk for serious flu complications and hospitalization. Now is the time to get the flu shot If you haven’t had your flu shot yet, now is the time to get it, since flu activity typically starts to pick up in October. (The CDC has already noted an early uptick in flu cases, with the Southeast and South Central areas of the country reporting the highest levels.) “It takes about two weeks after you get your vaccine for your body’s immune system to mount a good antibody response. You need to factor that time into it as well,” Nipunie Rajapakse, M.D., a pediatric infectious diseases physician at the Mayo Clinic Children’s Center, explained in a news release. Everyone 6 months and older is encouraged to get the vaccine. And this year, health officials are urging all adults 65 and older to get what’s known as a high-dose version of the flu shot (there are three different options to choose from). Older adults are among those at highest risk for complications from the flu and account for the majority of flu-related hospitalizations and deaths. The CDC estimates that the flu was responsible for between 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 to 52,000 deaths annually between 2010 and 2020. “Vaccination is the best defense we have against the worst outcomes of getting the flu,” the CDC’s Houry said. ﻿ Rachel Nania writes about health care and health policy for AARP.

To protect ourselves and our community, everyone is encouraged to get their flu shot—ideally by the end of this month. “Getting vaccinated is a quick, safe and easy way to prevent contracting the flu and spreading it to others,” said Dr. Bob Pelz, PeaceHealth’s medical director for infection prevention. “I get the flu shot every year because I have a responsibility to do everything I can to protect my patients, coworkers, friends and family as much as I can,” he said. Who should be vaccinated and when? Flu season typically begins in November or December and can ramp up quickly. The CDC recommends getting the flu shot before the end of October – although it’s never too late while the disease is still present in the community. It usually takes about two weeks after a shot for the vaccine to reach full effect. The vaccination is safe and effective for nearly everyone. These groups, who are particularly vulnerable, should make flu shots a priority: Anyone 65 and older People with certain medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease Pregnant people Children younger than 5 “We encourage families to bring their kids 6 months and older in for their flu vaccination as soon as possible,” said Dr. Serena Black, a pediatric hospitalist at Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend and PeaceHealth’s director of children’s medical services. “Influenza is highly contagious and can be easy to spread among children in daycare and school settings and has potential to make kids very sick. Even if they have mild symptoms, infected children can pass the flu on to grandparents or others who are at high risk of complications if they get sick.” Where are flu shots available? Pediatrics: PeaceHealth Pediatrics has set aside times specifically for flu vaccinations at the RiverBend Pavilion clinic in Springfield and the University District and Barger clinics in Eugene. Please call your pediatrician’s office to schedule an appointment. A clinic for children 6 months to 11 years old in the Cottage Grove area will be held on Saturday, Oct. 29, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at PeaceHealth Cottage Grove Community Medical Center, 1515 Village Drive. No appointment is needed. Visit www.peacehealth.org/flushot for the dates and times of all the pediatric vaccination clinics. Adults: Many PeaceHealth family medicine clinics are scheduling flu shot clinics. Please schedule using MyPeaceHealth, or call ahead. For more details about offerings in each community, please visit www.peacehealth.org/flushot. Area pharmacies also are a good option. What else can I do to protect against the flu? Continue to wash your hands frequently. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and dispose of the tissue in the trash. Avoid close contact with people who are sick, and limit contact with others when you feel sick. The flu vaccine is never a 100 percent guarantee you won’t get sick, but it can significantly lower your chances of becoming ill. And even if you do get the flu, you’ll likely experience milder symptoms if you’ve been vaccinated.

Link: https://health.choc.orgreatments-and-tips-to-help-kids-with-the-flu-feel-better/ As flu season approaches, there are various ways to help prevent your child from getting sick with the flu. But, what should parents do if their child does come down with the flu? Here, Dr. Teresa Lee, a pediatrician in CHOC’s Primary Care Network, explains how the flu is commonly treated and how you can help your child feel better, faster. What is the flu? The flu (influenza) is a very contagious viral infection of the respiratory tract (nose, throat, and lungs). The flu can make someone feel sick for up to 7 to 10 days. Learn about the seven other respiratory illnesses common in kids. How is the flu treated? The flu usually doesn’t need medical treatment. Sometimes, doctors might prescribe antiviral medicine for some people who have the flu. This medicine works best if given within the first 2 days of the illness. It can make flu symptoms milder and shorten the illness by a couple of days. But it has some side effects, so discuss the pros and cons of taking it with your doctor. Doctors don’t prescribe antibiotics for the flu. Antibiotics only work against bacteria, not viruses. How can I help my child feel better when they have the flu? If your child gets the flu: Offer plenty of liquids. Fever and appetite loss is common with the flu and can lead to dehydration. Encourage your child to rest in bed or on the couch with a supply of magazines, books, quiet music, and perhaps a favorite movie. Get more sick day activities for kids. Dress your child in layers that are easy to add and remove during bouts of chills or fever. Can I give my child over-the-counter fever-reducing or cough and cold medicine? Give acetaminophen, like Tylenol, or ibuprofen, like Motrin and Advil, for fever and aches. Do not give aspirin unless your doctor tells you to. It has been linked to a rare but serious illness called Reye syndrome. Featured article Acetaminophen vs. ibuprofen and how to administer both safely You can give over-the-counter cough or cold medicines to children over 6 years old if your doctor says it’s okay. Follow the package instructions carefully so you give the right amount. Do not give cold or cough medicines to children under 6 years old because they can cause bad reactions. Can I give my kids honey to help with their flu symptoms? Honey can help loosen a stubborn cough in children older than 12 months of age. Give one to two teaspoons of honey at night. Do not give honey to children under 12 months old. How can I help relieve my child’s stuffy nose? Running a cool-mist humidifier can help relieve coughs and runny or stuffy noses. Clean it after each use or at least once a day. For babies: Put a few drops of saline (salt water) into the nose, then gently suction the mucus out with a bulb syringe. Do this no more than two to three times a day so that the inside of your baby’s nose does not get swollen or sore. For older kids: Give two sprays of saline nose spray three times a day. A CHOC expert helps parents distinguish a common cold from the flu. How can I prevent my child from getting the flu? Take care of yourself and the other people in your family. If you haven’t already, speak to your doctor about getting the flu vaccine for you and other family members. It’s recommended yearly for everyone older than 6 months of age. Also, wash your hands well and often, especially after picking up used tissues. If your doctor prescribes medicine to ease symptoms, call the pharmacist before you go to pick it up. In a severe flu season, some pharmacies might have trouble keeping the medicines in stock. Germ busters for kids. How long should my child stay home with the flu? Kids who are sick should stay home from school and childcare until they: Feel better. Have been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of a fever-reducing medicine.

EatingWell's Editorial Guidelines Close Photo: Getty Images About 36 million Americans per year come down with the regular seasonal flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. With many health experts predicting a strong possibility for a "twindemic," involving high infection rates of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu, there's never been a better time to get an updated COVID-19 booster shot and this year's flu shot. ICYMI, now or ASAP is the best time to get a flu shot this year, to bolster your immune system before the virus season really gets into full swing. "The flu shot, in combination with hand-washing, is among our best defenses against this highly contagious, and potentially frustrating, infectious disease," explains Jonathan Yadlosky, M.D., the medical director of UPMC Matilda Theiss Health Center in Pittsburgh. The National Foundation for Infectious Diseases recently released the results from a late-summer survey that found that only 49% of American adults plan to get a flu vaccine during the 2022-2023 flu season. The CDC recommends that everyone age 6 months and older get vaccinated against flu annually, Patricia A. Stinchfield, RN, M.S., CPNP, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based president of the NFID, confirms. So if you can do your part to raise that statistic, you'll be protecting not only your own health, but also the health of those with whom you share a household, workplace or school, along with anyone you encounter as you go about your daily tasks and holiday gatherings. If the potential for post-shot pain has you on the fence about getting a flu shot, we'll coach you through how to feel your best each step of the way. Read on for what to eat and drink before and after your vaccine. You're just days away from feeling fantastic and having extra antibodies. 20 Healthy Recipes to Make When It Seems Like Everyone's Sick Before the Flu Shot No need to overhaul your entire meal plan, Yadlosky advises: "A healthy and balanced diet along with a slight increase in hydration is all someone will really need to be nutritionally prepared." We've broken down a few specific tips to act as your pre-shot starter pack. But there's no need to wait until you have a flu vaccine appointment (if you haven't booked one already) to start shifting your strategy, confirms Roxana Ehsani, RD, CSSD, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Miami and a national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Start today to ensure that you feel your best before and after. Drink 16 Ounces More Water per Day "Staying hydrated is important to your overall health, and is a key thing to focus on when planning for your vaccine," Stinchfield says. Drinking enough H2O helps your body maintain a normal temperature, which may be particularly helpful leading up to a flu shot since fever is a possible side effect. The amount of water you need varies based on a number of factors (here's a rough guideline for how much water you should drink), but "try to be intentional about drinking an extra glass or two of water each day leading up to your vaccine," Stinchfield adds. If you find it challenging to meet your mark, there are a few things you can do to make it more enjoyable to up your intake: Carry a water bottle with you and refill it throughout the day. Infuse your water with citrus and/or herbs to perk up its flavor. Follow Drew Barrymore's lead and invest in a chic pitcher to keep within your line of sight. Consider adding some hydrating foods to your menu to supplement what you sip. 5 Easy Ways to Stay Healthy Through Cold and Flu Season Prioritize Anti-Inflammatory Foods While there's no one recipe ingredient, vitamin or mineral that can prevent disease, there are some foods and nutrients that can help support your immune system so it can perform at its peak and is better able to do its important job of fighting off foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria. One of the best ways to "feed" your immune system is to lean into more anti-inflammatory foods. Beyond acting as part of your immunity Rx, this will also help reduce inflammation in the body pre- and post- shot, Ehsani says. Over time, following an anti-inflammatory diet can help reduce your risk for other chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes, too. Anti-inflammatory foods may also help decrease feelings of fatigue and possibly reduce your risk for headaches. Our anti-inflammatory comfort food meal plan is packed with fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy fats like fish and nuts, hearty whole grains and protein-packed beans, lentils and more. The comfort food factor will help calm any pre-shot stress, and the cozy recipes are ideal to savor as temperatures begin to dip. Aim for Balanced and Colorful Meals and Snacks "It's important to note that the flu vaccine cannot cause flu illness. This is a common misconception. However, flu activity starts to ramp up in October and November, meaning it's a good time to give your immune system a boost with nutrient-rich meals at any time—and it's never too early to start this healthy strategy," Stinchfield says. One of the easiest ways to mix up your menu and maximize the amount of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants you're consuming is to focus on adding more color to your plate, Ehsani says. (BTW, we suggest adding these 5 fall superfoods to your shopping list, since they can support your immune system during cold and flu season.) "Fruits and veggies are among our most nutrient-dense foods, and most Americans are not consuming enough of them," Ehsani explains, and the USDA confirms. Setting a goal to include at least three different natural colors on your plate at each meal will go a long way to help support an overall stoked and strong immune system. Bonus: Fruits and veggies are packed with water, so will help hydrate you pre- and post-shot too, Ehsani adds. Pack a Snack Receiving a flu vaccine can trigger anxiety among some individuals, Stinchfield says, which may, in turn, result in fainting. "Having a snack and some water right before your vaccine has been shown to sometimes prevent anxiety-related fainting," she says. "Pack an easy snack and a water bottle just in case," to enjoy on your way to your flu shot. Snag one of these healthy grab-and-go snacks, or whip up one of these 29 dietitian-approved homemade, packable snacks. After the Flu Shot There aren't any foods that are necessarily off-limits after getting a flu shot, says Lauren Manaker M.S., RD, LD, a registered dietitian and owner of Nutrition Now Counseling in Charleston, South Carolina. So just listen to your body to feed it what it's craving and keep these general best practices in mind. Continue to Stay Hydrated A good balance of fluids and nutrients helps the immune system process the flu shot and begin to build protection, Yadlosky explains. Plus, one of the possible ripple effects of a flu shot is a slight headache. Being dehydrated can exacerbate said headache, Manaker says. Drinking adequate water (and a glass or two extra, if possible) the day before, the day of and the day after your flu shot is a good rule of thumb, she says. Add in Some Prebiotics and Probiotics The scientific jury is still out, but Manaker says that gut-healthy foods with pre- and probiotics may help make your vaccine more effective, according to some evidence. Aim to eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, yogurt, kefir and fermented foods (such as kimchi, sauerkraut and kombucha) to give your good gut bacteria a boost. Stock Plain Foods While rare and almost always mild, another side effect of the flu vaccine is nausea, so it's never a bad idea to be prepared for an upset stomach, Stinchfield says. Pantry staples like saltine crackers, pasta and rice are wise choices if you're experiencing any nausea, as are bananas and avocados. Check out our complete primer on easy-to-digest-foods—plus what to skip for when your stomach feels "off." Maintain Your Healthy Habits Within a few days of being vaccinated, you should be fully recovered from any of the possible rare and minor flu shot side effects, the CDC says. "If you increased your water intake and incorporated more nutrient-rich foods in your diet, congratulations—and keep up the good work! These habits are great ways to support your overall health and wellness, flu season or not," Stinchfield concludes. The Bottom Line These ideas for what to eat and drink before and after a flu shot can help you breeze through the appointment and recovery process. Still, that doesn't mean you're protected by a germ-proof coat of armor. "While getting the flu shot can protect a person during cold and flu season, it isn't a magic bullet for everyone," Manaker says. "Continuing to support your immune health by eating vitamin-rich produce, sleeping well and exercising can help support your immune health and can be important components of your lifestyle choices during cold and flu season."

Read our privacy policyA national bird flu “prevention zone” has been declared by the UK government as the country continues to grapple with the worst outbreak of the disease ever recorded.At least three million birds have already been culled by farmers and landowners due to the spread of the disease, which has also taken a heavy toll on populations of endangered wild birds.The government said new Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) rules will come into force from midday on Monday requiring all bird keepers in Great Britain to follow “strict biosecurity measures help protect their flocks from the threat of avian flu”.“Implementing the highest levels of biosecurity measures on farms is the most effective way to reduce the risk of disease spreading within flocks,” the government said.The introduction of the AIPZ comes after 190 cases of bird flu have been confirmed across the UK since late October 2021, with over 30 of these confirmed since the beginning of the month.RecommendedNearly 3 million birds culled as UK grapples with ‘unprecedented’ wave of bird fluBird flu case prompts Omaha zoo to close several exhibitsRare wild birds among many species hit by ‘unprecedented’ avian flu outbreakBird flu outbreak nears worst ever in US with 37 million chickens and turkeys deadThe East of England has been particularly badly hit with outbreaks in poultry and captive birds.There have also been outbreaks in the southwest and in wild birds at multiple sites across the country.In a statement, the government said: “Avian influenza circulates naturally in wild birds and when they migrate to the United Kingdom from mainland Europe over the winter they can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. Maintaining strict biosecurity is the most effective method of protecting birds from the virus.”However, the outbreak of the disease, which has also heavily impacted globally important populations of seabirds around the UK’s coastline, has been linked back to east Asian poultry farms.As well as the millions of captive birds culled, “hundreds of thousands” of wild birds are known to have died.open image in galleryA national bird flu prevention zone is to apply to all of Britain in effort to contain the country’s worst ever outbreak of the disease (Getty)In a joint statement the chief veterinary officers for England, Scotland and Wales said: “Bird keepers have faced the largest ever outbreak of avian flu this year and winter brings an even more increased risk to flocks as migratory birds return to the United Kingdom.“Scrupulous biosecurity and hygiene measures are the best forms of defence, which is why we have declared an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone across Great Britain, meaning that all bird keepers must take action to help prevent the disease spreading to more poultry and other domestic birds.“The introduction of an AIPZ means regardless of whether you keep a few birds or thousands, you are legally required to meet enhanced biosecurity requirements to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease.”Last month, when The Independent reported the scale of the culls at poultry farms around the country, the government said the numbers represented a small proportion of overall poultry production, which stands at around 20 million birds slaughtered a week.The government said the introduction of an AIPZ followed a decision to raise the risk level for avian influenza incursion in wild birds in Great Britain from “medium” to “high”.open image in galleryEarlier this year the RSPB called for the annual release of 50 million non-native pheasants to be halted to help stop the spread of the disease (Getty)“For poultry and captive birds the risk level has been raised from ‘medium’ to ‘high’ at premises where biosecurity is below the required standards, and from ‘low’ to ‘medium’ where stringent biosecurity measures are applied,” Defra said.The UK Health Security Agency said the risk to public health from the virus was “very low”, and the Food Standards Agency advises that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat, it said.The government also said due to the continuing risk posed by the disease “a mandatory housing requirement in the AIPZ may arise” in future.The AIPZ means bird keepers across Great Britain must:Keep free-ranging birds within fenced areas, and ponds, watercourses and permanent standing water must be fenced off (except in specific circumstances eg zoo birds)Clean and disinfect footwear and keep areas where birds live clean and tidyMinimise movement in and out of bird enclosuresReduce any existing contamination by cleansing and disinfecting concrete areas, and fencing off wet or boggy areasKeep domestic ducks and geese separate from other poultryEnsure the areas where birds are kept are unattractive to wild birds, for example by netting ponds, and by removing wild bird food sourcesFeed and water your birds in enclosed areas to discourage wild birds.More aboutGovernmentbird fluGreat BritainDiseaseBirdsfarmersavian fluEnvironmentJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesCommentsMost PopularPopular videosSponsored FeaturesGet in touchContact usOur ProductsSubscribeRegisterNewslettersToday’s EditionInstall our appArchiveOther publicationsInternational editionsIndependent en EspañolIndependent ArabiaIndependent TurkishIndependent PersianIndependent UrduThe StandardExtrasAdvisorPuzzlesAll topicsBetting OffersVoucher codesCompetitions and offersIndependent AdvertisingIndependent IgniteSyndicationWorking at The IndependentLegalCode of conduct and complaintsContributorsCookie policyPrivacy policyUser policiesModern Slavery StatementThank you for registeringPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged inExperts Call Out Owner of TikTok Emu Emmanuel Over Avian Flu Risk - Business Insider Menu icon A vertical stack of three evenly spaced horizontal lines.

( Leah Hennel)Social SharingThe flu is here and experts are urging Albertans to roll up their sleeves as influenza shots roll out around the province this week.Alberta launched its flu vaccination program for the general public Monday, making the shots available free of charge to everyone six months of age and older. "We know that it's here and it's probably going to start pretty hard because this is how it seemed to start in Australia and other parts of the Southern Hemisphere," said Dr. Cora Constantinescu, a Calgary-based infectious disease specialist. Provincial data show that as of Oct. 1, there were 40 confirmed cases of influenza in the province, with the bulk of them in the Calgary and Edmonton zones.Ten hospitalizations had been reported at that time, including two ICU admissions."Officially the flu season starts when we have a hospitalized case of influenza," said Constantinescu. "So we know if we have a few hospitalized cases there are a lot more out in the community."The Alberta government has ordered 1.9 million doses of the vaccine, which will be available at pharmacies and some community medical clinics.Alberta Health Services' immunization clinics will provide flu shots to kids under five and their families, along with people who don't have a provincial health care number.Bracing for a tough seasonExperts are keeping a close eye on the trends."It's too early to say if this is higher or lower than expected," said Dr. Karla Gustafson, a medical officer of health in the Calgary zone."This year with the anticipation of early flu activity — we're already seeing it — I think [it's] best to get immunized and get that influenza vaccine as early as possible this year."After disappearing during the early part of the pandemic, influenza reappeared this spring as COVID-related public health measures were lifted, sparking an unusually late 2021-22 flu season.Calgary-based public health physician Dr. Jia Hu is urging Albertans to get their flu shots and their bivalent boosters. People five and up can get both shots at the same time (Erin Collins/CBC)"Because we really haven't seen a lot of flu for the past few years because of COVID restrictions, people have probably lost some immunity to flu, which might make it a bit worse, " said Dr. Jia Hu, a public health physician who teaches at the University of Calgary.He's worried about vaccine uptake. Just 27 per cent of Albertans got the flu shot last season."I think there's a sense of complacency — a lack of concern," he said. "And I hope that this year people recognize … that flu will be back."'Twindemic' There are also concerns about a so-called "twindemic," with both influenza and the SARS-CoV-2 virus potentially surging at the same time. It's a phenomenon that's more likely with public health measures gone."They'll certainly both be circulating this season. People will certainly be susceptible to both of them. Guaranteed," said Hu.AnalysisWe're close to cold and flu season. So, what does that look like with COVID-19 in the mix?The flu is back: What can Albertans expect this fall?That could cause further strain on Alberta's struggling healthcare system as the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 continues to rise, and it could increase the risk to Albertans."[It] can lead to potentially more severe illness in people if they acquire multiple viruses at the same time. So it is important to do everything you can to stay protected," said Gustafson, noting Albertans five and up can get their flu vaccine and a COVID shot, including bivalent boosters, at the same time.Young children at higher riskConstantinescu, who works at the Alberta Children's Hospital, said children under five and those with underlying health conditions are at higher risk for severe influenza."However, anecdotally, every year we see kids of all ages end up in hospital with influenza complications," she said, adding that can include serious conditions such as pneumonia, lung abscess and heart complications.Already this flu season, one child between the ages of one and four has been admitted to the ICU due to influenza.Dr. Cora Constantinescu is a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Alberta Children's Hospital in Calgary. (Submitted by Cora Constantinescu)Constantinescu is working to dispel misconceptions that have traditionally held people back getting from the vaccine.She says people often confuse the so-called "stomach flu" — vomiting and diarrhea — with influenza, which can appear with respiratory symptoms, body aches, fever and headaches. Some people don't bother getting the flu shot if they've had a stomach bug."If you have had one of those in the past, you should still get the flu vaccine because that does not have built in immunity against influenza," said Constantinescu.And she said people who are allergic to eggs can safely get the flu vaccine, just like everybody else.ABOUT THE AUTHORJennifer LeeReporterJennifer Lee is a CBC News reporter based in Calgary.

Flu season is already ramping up, and experts are expecting an especially rough fall and winter, so getting your shot before the end of October is pretty darn important. There are plenty of precautions that can help protect you from the flu—washing your hands frequently and masking up, to name a couple—but the vaccine is a tool that should top your list.Like any vaccine though, the flu shot does come with potential side effects—and this is usually a good thing. It’s a strong sign that your immune system is responding to the vaccine and building up those all-important, infection-fighting antibodies, as SELF previously reported.But how long do flu shot side effects last? Here’s what you should know so you can plan ahead, just in case you do end up feeling a bit crummy after your appointment.How long do flu shot side effects last for most people?First it’s important to note that everyone reacts differently post-vaccine. Some people get the flu shot and feel totally fine, while others may feel a bit unwell. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most common side effects that can occur include soreness, inflammation, or swelling in the arm or around the injection site; low-grade headache; fever; nausea; muscles aches; fatigue; and fainting (especially if needles tend to freak you out).“Most people get pain at the injection site and a sore arm,” John Sellick, DO, infectious disease expert and epidemiological researcher at the University at Buffalo/SUNY in New York, tells SELF. “It’s typical of what we see with most other vaccines.”Thankfully these symptoms are usually mild and go away on their own. The duration “varies from person to person” but, in general, side effects from the flu vaccine “usually last about a day”—again, if you have them at all, infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, MD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells SELF. How to feel a bit better when side effects strikeAgain, any discomfort post-vaccine should be pretty short-lived, Dr. Adalja says. But if you’re not feeling great, there are a few things you can do to try to speed up your recovery time:Take OTC pain relievers. Acetaminophen is a good option for reducing fever and easing any soreness, Dr. Schaffner says.Move your affected arm. This can help promote blood flow to the area, which helps repair the muscle in your arm that’s (very slightly) torn from the injection, Dr. Schaffner says.Cool it down. Putting a cool, damp washcloth over your arm can help with any swelling and visible inflammation or reddening of the skin, Dr. Schaffner says.Drink plenty of fluids. Being hydrated won’t necessarily get rid of the side effects, but it enables your body to work more efficiently, Dr. Sellick says. Also, being dehydrated can make you feel even worse.Rest! If your body feels off and you’re just sluggish, take it easy, Dr. Schaffner says. Consider going to bed a bit earlier, or doing lighter stretching instead of an intense run, for example.When should you talk to a doctor about potential flu shot side effects?Some people may have an allergic reaction to a component in the flu vaccine, like egg protein, but this is fairly rare. If you do have an allergic reaction, it usually happens within a few minutes to a few hours after you get the shot, the CDC says, so you’ll know pretty quickly; those who are allergic can potentially experience trouble breathing, wheezing, hives, weakness, a rapid heartbeat, and/or dizziness. You should always let your health care provider or pharmacist know in advance if you have a history of allergies or severe reactions to any vaccines, so you can talk through your options with that in mind.And, you probably already know this, but it never hurts to mention it again: The flu shot does not actually give you the flu—even if it kinda feels like it for a day. “It’s absolutely medically impossible to get the flu from the flu vaccine,” Dr. Schaffner stresses.If you suddenly start experiencing respiratory symptoms after you get your vaccine—like coughing, sneezing, or a sore throat—Dr. Sellick says that’s a sign you probably caught something before your appointment. It’s totally possible to come down with a cold, the flu, or even COVID before you get vaccinated, and then coincidentally develop symptoms of that illness shortly after you get your jab.“Some people may get their flu shot on Monday and start to have a runny nose or sore throat on Tuesday,” Dr. Schaffner explains. That usually “means you picked up a virus from somewhere else.” Related:How to Prep for Cold and Flu Season Right Now, Before You Get SickHere’s How Long You Can Expect the Flu to Last, According to a DoctorI Don’t Feel Sick Anymore—But Is My Cold Still Contagious?Korin is a former New Yorker who now lives at the beach.

A fall booster is recommended as long as it’s been five months since you last got COVID or had a COVID vaccine. Some who might be at a high risk from the disease can get the booster after a shorter three-month wait.Doctors expect worse flu season compared to previous yearsSo far in 2022, there have been 40 lab-confirmed cases of influenza in Alberta.AHS lead medical officer of health of communicable diseases Dr. Kristin Klein said flu shots are especially important this year, since COVID restrictions that suppressed flu spread over the past two years are no longer in effect.“Definitely anticipate that it will be worse than the last couple of years,” she said.Young children and adults older than 65 are at higher risk of serious health problems from influenza, and the immunization doesn’t guarantee you won’t get the flu, but it reduces your chances of getting it and spreading it to others.Looking to other countries in the southern hemisphere, where the flu season takes place over our summer months, Klein said there’s increased flu activity after a couple “atypical” years.Advertisement 4Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content“So what that means is we’re going to see probably several thousand cases, as well as the impacts on our hospitals and ICUs.” Dr. Kristin Klein, AHS Medical Officer of Health speaks to the media as Alberta’s influenza immunization campaign begins on Monday, Oct. 17, 2022 in Edmonton, to all Albertans six months of age and older. COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters, may also be offered to individuals that are eligible with each influenza vaccine appointment booked .Greg Southam-Postmedia Photo by Greg Southam /PostmediaKlein added there’s understandable fatigue around COVID at this point, but the start of flu season is a good reminder to assess your immune protection.“Having the simplicity of offering both vaccines this fall at the same appointment, I’m really hoping people take that opportunity and come get immunized.”Albertans can book flu and COVID vaccines at bookvaccine.alberta.ca, by calling 811 or by contacting a local pharmacy. Some pharmacies may also offer walk-in appointments.Children between six months and five years old have to be immunized at an AHS clinic or in a doctor’s office. They’re also the only group that can’t get both vaccines at the same time, and instead have to wait 14 days between the shots.masmith@postmedia.com@meksmithArticle contentShare this article in your social network Share this Story : Albertans can get flu, COVID shots in one appointment as fall flu season arrives Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr CommentsYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.Create an AccountSign in Join the Conversation Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

(The Canadian Press)Social SharingNova Scotians can book their annual flu shot online as of Monday, with appointments beginning on Oct. 22.The province is using the same online portal to book influenza vaccines at pharmacies that it used for COVID-19 shots.Residents can also call 1-833-797-7772 to book an appointment.Those who wish to receive a flu shot from a family doctor, nurse practitioner or family practice nurse can do so by calling the clinic directly.The flu vaccine is available to all Nova Scotians over the age of six months.During a press conference Monday, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Robert Strang said some groups, including those over 65, young children, the immunocompromised and those who are pregnant, are at greater risk of "severe influenza." And with the health-care system already under strain, Strang said it's important for all Nova Scotians to get the jab."We continue to see an increase of respiratory illness in 2022 that we haven't seen in the last couple of years of the pandemic, especially in children," he said. "In the southern hemisphere, who are entering their spring, just coming out of their flu season, they had early and substantial surges of influenza, again with a focus on children."Strang added that the department is concerned about simultaneous influenza and COVID surges during the colder weather, and further stressed the importance of getting both vaccines.Public Health advises all residents to get the shot, especially those at risk of developing complications from influenza, as well as those who care for them. Those with a higher risk include adults over 65, children six months to five years old, those who are pregnant, people in crowded living situations, residents of long-term care facilities and people with chronic illness.People who are five years old and older can receive the flu shot before, after or at the same time as a COVID-19 shot.Children aged six months to four years must have at least a 14-day gap between receiving an influenza shot and a COVID-19 vaccine.Flu season usually begins in late December or early January, but the Health Department says there have already been a few influenza cases in the province.MORE TOP STORIESBanning use of NDAs in sexual assault matters not a priority for N.S. governmentN.S. families who lost their homes to Fiona scramble to find a place to liveFuel costs mean Nova Scotia Power rates could spike again in the coming yearsNeighbours call out Halifax police for high-speed chase across lawns, school yard in residential areaBig jump in number of patients seeking doctors in central N.S. over last 2 years, figures showCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorAdd some “good” to your morning and evening.Get the latest top stories from across Nova Scotia in your inbox every weekday.Email address:SubscribeCurrent TimeIgnore this field.

(CBC)Social SharingP.E.I. has already seen its first lab-confirmed case of influenza for the 2022-23 season."As anticipated, and we talked about it, the influenza season may be earlier and this is certainly earlier than we would expect," Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison told CBC News: Compass host Louise Martin Thursday.Flu, kept down by public health measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, has not been much of an issue on the Island for the last couple of years. A more severe season is expected this year, and a fall wave of COVID-19 on top of that is still possible.The number of people in hospital with COVID-19 quadrupled in the last week, and the number of confirmed cases doubled."It reminds us of the importance of getting vaccinated for both. We know that our influenza will protect us from severe illness related to influenza," said Morrison."Being vaccinated and making sure that you're up to date with your boosters and your COVID vaccine is really important."It is too early to tell if the recent jump in cases is a bump or the beginning of a wave, she said.COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations jump on P.E.I.P.E.I.'s COVID-19 isolation requirement reduced to 5 daysP.E.I. has extended self-isolation requirements for people testing positive for COVID-19.

Pre-COVID, flu was one of the top 10 causes of death in Canada, with an estimated 12,200 hospitalizations and 3,500 deaths annually.1 As influenza transmission/exposure was low in the community over the last 2 years, there is concern over the reduction in natural immunity to influenza. Signs point to a severe flu season, with growing fears around a potential âtwindemicâ, referring to a surge in both COVID and influenza. Looking at surveillance data from Australiaâs 2022 flu season earlier this year, often used as a predictor for the northern hemisphere, there was a stark increase in laboratory confirmed influenza cases, with a significantly higher peak number of cases this year compared to each of the last 5 years (both before and during COVID).2 Another concerning statistic is the prediction for low flu shot uptake this year, with only half of Canadians indicating that they intend to get vaccinated against the flu.3 After these last 2 seasons, pharmacies are well-versed in adapting to the latest recommendations to provide flu, COVID, and other recommended vaccines. Keep reading for some key updates and reminders to help pharmacy teams protect your patients! Whatâs new for flu? Advertisement - article continues below Advertisement A new product this year is the recombinant influenza vaccine (SupemtekTM), which contains purified hemagglutinin (HA) proteins that are an exact match to the recommended flu strains by the World Health Organization and three times the dose per strain (45mcg) compared to standard dose vaccines (15mcg). SupemtekTM and the other non-egg-based vaccine (FlucelvaxÂ®, standard dose, cell-based) are not included in any provincialerritorial programs. Patients may access these products from pharmacies privately, although pharmacists in ON will require a direct order to administer them. BC is providing the adjuvanted trivalent vaccine (FluadÂ®) for all patients 65+ this year; SK and MB are providing the high dose quadrivalent vaccine (FluzoneÂ® High Dose) for all patients 65+ this year. Pharmacists in Nova Scotia will be able to administer flu vaccines to patients 6 months and up. Manitoba recently updated minimum age for pharmacy administration of flu shots to 2+ (note: only for publicly funded flu vaccines, otherwise the minimum age is 7+). In other provinces the minimum age for flu remains 2+ (ON, NB), 4+ (BC, can administer FlumistÂ® for ages 2+), and 5+ (AB, NFL, PEI, SK, YK). Co-administration with COVID-19 & other vaccines? Flu vaccines can be co-administered with other vaccines (including live vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines in ages 5+). With all the different types of vaccine messaging they receive, patients may not recognize that bivalent COVID boosters donât offer any protection against flu, clarification from pharmacy staff with strong affirmations that both vaccines are necessary can aid with uptake. Surveys show that Canadians would be open to getting vaccines co-administered if presented the option to schedule them together.3 Many high-risk patients for flu should also be recommended pneumococcal (age 50+ or patients with chronic conditions) and herpes zoster (age 50+ or immunocompromised 18+) vaccines. When possible, scheduling multiple vaccines on the same day may optimize workflow and reduce down-time for patients, and is recommended by NACI.4 When administering multiple vaccines, use different limbs if possible, or separate injection sites by at least 1 inch.4 What is the best option for my patientâs flu vaccine? The key message continues to be: âthe best vaccine is the one you get todayâ. Patients should be advised not to delay their flu shot, as all products are safe and effective for their indicated ages. If you are in a province with multiple vaccine options available, or if the patient would like to receive a non-publicly funded vaccine, there are some considerations between products. For patients aged 2-17 who are needle averse, FlumistÂ® (intranasal), the only live-attenuated flu vaccine available in Canada, may be offered (publicly funded in BC, PEI, YK). As a reminder, children less than 9 years of age receiving their very first flu vaccine require a second dose at a minimum interval of 4 weeks. For older adults aged 50-64 or those with comorbidities who are not yet eligible for the High-Dose quadrivalent vaccine (indicated for ages 65+), you may consider recommending the new recombinant vaccine (SupemtekTM) or a cell-based vaccine (FlucelvaxÂ®) to provide a better match to circulating flu strains than traditional egg-based vaccines. Please note neither of these options are publicly funded. For ages 65+, NACI recommends high dose (FluzoneÂ® High Dose) over standard dose quadrivalent vaccines (multiple products). FluzoneÂ® High Dose contains the highest dose of antigen available (60mcg per strain), especially important with influenza A, the strain that causes most severe disease for older adults. Other options include the trivalent vaccine (FluadÂ®), which contains an adjuvant to help boost immune response. Similarly, SupemtekTM may be recommended to provide an exact antigen match and higher dose (45 mcg per strain). If none of these high dose, non-egg-based or adjuvanted vaccines are available options, standard dose quadrivalent vaccines are still recommended, immunogenic, and safe. How do we integrate other recommendations into the flu vaccine workflow? When possible, utilize booking systems to screen for relevant vaccines (flu, COVID, adult immunizations). Passive screening with signage in waiting areas/drop off and adding vaccine screening (meningitis B, HPV, pneumonia, shingles) within consent forms can help patients self-identify based on age and/or medical conditions. Pharmacies may also consider implementing programs to prompt patients to schedule a follow up appointment for other recommended vaccines as the initial rush for flu subsides. Are there strategies to improve the vaccine experience for patients and families? A study conducted in 5 independent Wholehealth pharmacy locations found that implementing the CARD (Comfort, Ask, Relax, Distract) system improved the vaccination experience for children, parents, and pharmacy staff.5 Children reported that CARD reduced their pain and fear, while parents reported that CARD helped âa lotâ in getting their children vaccinated.5 Although studied in pediatric patients, the main approaches used in CARD (patient centredness, supporting autonomy, reducing fear triggers, distractions etc.) are useful for all ages. For more information on CARD, watch this webinar! Community pharmacies have established themselves as key vaccination service providers. Last year, the majority of flu vaccines in Canada were administered in pharmacies, with many of these patients planning on returning to pharmacy for their flu shot this year.4 With the possibility of a severe flu season, pharmacists and pharmacy teams will have a significant role in guiding patients to get fully protected against vaccine preventable diseases, to protect our communities and support the capacity of our healthcare systems.

With flu season underway and COVID-19 continuing to evolve, there’s a need for action — both on the part of individuals and governments — to keep communities safe this fall, say Brock University experts. Brock immunologist Adam MacNeil and political theorist and legal scholar Alison Braley-Rattai are weighing in on ways to increase protection for Canadians during the season when sickness often rears its head. Providing clarity about whether people vaccinated against COVID should also get a flu shot, MacNeil explains that the immune system recognizes the influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses as being two distinct entities based on the three-dimensional structure of each. Therefore, flu and COVID vaccines do not overlap, he says. Brock University immunologist Adam MacNeil. The latest COVID vaccine is ‘bivalent,’ which means the booster targets the original strain plus subvariants arising from the Omicron strain, giving the immune system what MacNeil calls a “competitive edge.” The Associate Professor of Health Sciences says people often think of COVID-19 as being a ‘bad flu,’ since COVID and flu symptoms can appear similar, and both are spread through aerosols and droplets. But COVID has a more invisible side that can cause problems in other tissues and organs that may persist after infection, he says. This is thought to happen in part by causing inflammation of the blood vessels, or vasculitis, and by frequently finding its way into more places, including the brain and heart. “To give yourself the best possible protection against the expected surge in influenza and SARS-CoV-2 this fall, do yourself and your community a favour and get both vaccines as soon as you are eligible, wear a well-fitting N95 respirator when in crowded indoor locations or when ventilation and air filtration is poor, and practise distancing,” MacNeil says. Public health officials, he says, predict that the coming fall and winter will be “very challenging,” given Omicron’s infectiousness and ability to evade vaccine protection that performed well against the Delta variant last fall, in addition to the return to pre-pandemic behaviours. “Layer your protection by wearing a mask,” he says. “Layers are the hottest trend for a healthy fall and winter in 2022 and 2023.” MacNeil offers further insights in an article he wrote earlier this year for The Conversation. Associate Professor of Labour Studies Alison Braley-Rattai researches the moral and legal aspects and policy implications of childhood vaccination. Despite constitutional guarantees, Alison Braley-Rattai, Assistant Professor in Brock University’s Department of Labour Studies, says protecting workers’ rights continues to be a struggle. She says several recent studies show that, owing to heightened transmission, children’s susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 has been rising over the pandemic, increasing the possibility of severe outcomes.” Braley-Rattai says COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Ontario’s children is relatively low compared to adults. She explored the issue in an article in The Conversation earlier this month, where she argued that, to increase vaccine uptake, the provincial government should add COVID-19 to the list of “designated diseases” in its Immunization of School Pupils Act. Recent research has also been done in ‘nudge literature’ about how to encourage people toward a particular end, particularly in the areas of childhood vaccination, and, more recently, regarding COVID-19 vaccines, she says. Braley-Rattai says the ‘nudge literature’ describes ways of increasing routine vaccine uptake in general, including early intervention, targeted information campaigns, automatic reminders, individualized follow-ups and easier access. But vaccination alone is not enough, she says, adding COVID-19’s ability to mutate may make vaccination “increasingly less important than controlling infection itself.” “Here’s the rub: It makes little sense to include COVID vaccines under designated diseases without other measures to reduce infections, like air quality standards, masking, and better testing and tracing,” says Braley-Rattai. “Governments have abandoned the notion of public health for a ‘you do you’ approach which is, frankly, unconscionable given the long-term implications of infections for both individuals and society,” she says.

So, who is eligible for a free flu shot, how can you get the vaccine, and can it be combined with your Covid booster? Here’s what you need to know about flu vaccines in France. Who is eligible for the flu vaccine in France? French residents over 65 years old and those with eligible health conditions can receive an annual flu shot in France. Flu vaccines are covered under France’s state health insurance, meaning that all eligible persons with a Carte Vitale can receive the shot for free. Flu shots are also available to those not considered high-risk, but they won’t be covered by your state health insurance – instead, expect to pay between €6 and €10 depending on the pharmacy. Those eligible for a free flu vaccine in France include: People aged 65 and over People under 65 with certain chronic diseases and long-term health conditions (if in doubt, you should talk to your doctor to find out if you qualify) Pregnant women People with obesity Healthcare workers Caregivers and workers looking after young children or the elderly Professionals exposed to swine and avian influenza viruses How do I get my free flu shot? If you are eligible for a flu vaccine, you will typically be sent a voucher by post – you can take this voucher to the pharmacy to pick up your vaccine. If you haven’t received a voucher, if it’s your first time receiving a flu shot in France, or if you are unsure whether you are eligible, you should contact your médecin traitant (your doctor/GP). They will be able to provide you with the voucher. Getting vaccinated in France If it’s your first time getting vaccinated in France, you might be surprised to find that things are done a bit differently from how you are used to. In France, it is the responsibility of the patient (i.e. you!) to pick up the vaccine from the pharmacy and bring it to your appointment with you. Don’t forget, as the nurse will be unable to administer the vaccine without it! Once you have your free flu vaccine voucher, this serves as a prescription – take this to the pharmacy to pick up your shot. You can pick the vaccine up at any time before your vaccination appointment, but be aware that it must be kept refrigerated. However, there’s nothing stopping you from picking it up the week before at a time that is convenient, then storing it in your fridge at home until your appointment date. You will also be responsible for booking your vaccination appointment, either directly with the doctor or nurse, or online via Doctolib. In France, you can receive a vaccination from any doctor, midwife, nurse, or pharmacist (for under 16s or those with certain allergies, the vaccination will have to be administered by a doctor or midwife). Most people find it easiest to book directly with their local pharmacy (some smaller pharmacies may not offer vaccination services, so be sure to check) or with the doctor or nurse at their médecin traitant practice. When can I receive my flu shot in 2023? Vaccines are available to the above-mentioned at-risk groups from Tuesday, October 17th, 2023. For 2023, it has been announced that flu shots will be available to everyone from this date, instead of the usual prioritisation window that is typically reserved for high-risk individuals. Flu vaccines in France: FAQ Should I get the flu vaccine? The general advice is that anyone in the above-mentioned at-risk groups should receive a flu vaccine. While a flu vaccine does not eliminate the risk of catching the flu, vaccines are estimated to reduce the risk of needing to visit the doctor with the flu by 40-60%, and studies1 have shown that vaccinated patients were 26% less likely to be admitted to ICU and 31% less likely to die. If you are in doubt about receiving the vaccine, we highly recommend speaking to your doctor and following their advice. Can I get a flu vaccine in France if I’m not eligible? Flu vaccines are not only available to high-risk groups, but are also available to the general population. However, it’s important to note that flu vaccines for the general population are not covered by France’s state health insurance. The cost may be covered or partially covered by your Mutuelle health insurance, but this will depend on your policy. Typically a flu shot costs between €6 and €10, depending on the pharmacy. Can I get a flu vaccine in France if I don’t have a Carte Vitale? If you aren’t registered with France’s healthcare system, you can still receive the vaccine when it opens up to the general public. You will also need to pay for the vaccine, as detailed in the question above. However, there is nothing to stop a person without a Carte Vitale from receiving the flu vaccine. Can I receive my Covid booster shot and flu vaccine together? The latest Covid-19 booster vaccine will be available to high-risk groups from Monday, 2nd October. If you are eligible for the flu vaccine, you will also be eligible for the Covid-19 booster, and you can opt to have the vaccines administered together (although you will need to wait until the flu vaccine is released in order to do so). If you choose to do this, note that two separate vaccines will still be issued – one in each arm – but you will be able to receive both during a single appointment.

By Lauren Leffer Published October 17, 2022 | Comments (0) | ð Copied! Emus may have lovable faces, but that doesnât mean you should ignore CDC guidelines on bird flu. Photo: Cassandra Cury (Shutterstock) A highly infectious strain of avian influenza has been raging across the U.S. for months now, claiming the lives of thousands of wild birds and tens of millions of domestic poultry, according to the latest estimates from the CDC. And now, the bird flu has reportedly come to one of TikTokâs most famous farmâs: Knuckle Bump Farms in Florida, home to Emmanuel the Emu. The bird, who became a viral sensation for his video-bombing tendencies, has now gone viral in the bad way. Emmanuel contracted avian flu, according to multiple tweets from Taylor Blake, the influencer whose family owns the farm. âWe lost 50+ birds in 3 days. I am still trying to wrap my head around it,â she wrote on Twitter. âWe thought we were out of the woods, when Emmanuel unexpectedly went down,â Blake added. We lost 50+ birds in 3 days. I am still trying to wrap my head around it. We thought we were out of the woods, when Emmanuel unexpectedly went down this past Wednesday…ð pic.twitter.com/OPgts2XVWV — eco sister (@hiitaylorblake) October 15, 2022 As tragic and devastating as bird flu outbreaks are, and as beloved as Emmanuel the Emu may be, virologists on Twitter were horrified to see the type of up-close care Emmanuel seems to be receiving. Many of Blakeâs tweets show her cuddling face to face with the ill emu. I am trying my best to remain hopeful, tap into my unwavering faith, and trust that God is in control. I am also doing my best to remain thankful in the face of loss, for I have so much to be grateful forâ¤ï¸ Thank you for reading. pic.twitter.com/z0ozJ1yWCO — eco sister (@hiitaylorblake) October 15, 2022 Experts are warning: DO NOT DO THIS. âBeing face to face with a bird w [sic] avian flu is a bad idea,â posted Boghuma Kabisen Titanij, a doctor and global health and infectious disease researcher at Emory University. âThis is how zoonotic transmissions occur, this is why entire farms cull sick birds. We live with the threat of pandemic flu,â Titanij further explained in her tweet thread on the topic. https:/witter.com/embed/status/1581611288681013248 Although not very common, bird flu can and has jumped from poultry to people multiple times before. A strain closely related to the one currently circulating nationwide has infected hundreds hundreds of people in the past two decades and killed about 50% of those who contracted it, according to the World Health Organization. In the current U.S. outbreak, only one human is known to have contracted the virus. The person caught the virus at a commercial poultry facility in Colorado and recovered from the disease, according to WHO. Yet the virus has proven that it can mutate to be more transmissible between birds and people. Close contact with infected birds certainly increases the risk of cross-species spread. âInfected birds shed bird flu virus through their saliva, mucous, and feces,â warns the CDC. âHuman infections with bird flu viruses can happen when virus gets into a personâs eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or possibly dust) and a person breathes it in, or possibly when a person touches something that has virus on it then touches their mouth, eyes or nose,â the agency further says on its website. In other words: Absolutely, positively do not go nose to beak with a sick bird. Other virologists voiced their concern online. âI screamed when I saw this,â tweeted Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University and the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization. I screamed when I saw this — Dr. Angela Rasmussen (@angie_rasmussen) October 16, 2022 âIf your emu (or any bird) has avian influenza, do not kiss it. Do not cuddle with it. Do not touch it. Bird flu is extremely dangerous to humans and other animals. And it sounds harsh but to prevent [its] spread, birds that get avian flu should be euthanized,â said Rasmussen. And Tom Peacock, a flu researcher at Imperial College London, posted a lengthy thread outlining the risks of handling sick birds. Thread of avian influenza virus (AIV). First off a PSA – DO NOT touch, handle or attempt to treat suspected sick or dead birds yourself – particularly poultry, waterfowl (ducks, geese, etc) or seabirds. These are VERY dangerous viruses that can infect people and be deadly! — Tom Peacock (@PeacockFlu) October 16, 2022 Back at the farm, Blake has posted multiple tweets claiming she and her family are following âFDA guidelinesâ surrounding bird flu, including quarantining. However instead of cuddling infected birds, the CDC recommends that anyone responding directly to an avian influenza outbreak avoid direct contact where possible and wear protective equipment like gloves, a medical face mask, and eye protection when contact canât be avoided.

YonhapPrime Minister Han Duck-soo on Wednesday instructed officials to take preventive measures, including the culling of poultry, as the nation reported its first virulent avian influenza case in some six months. The emergency instruction came as the case was reported a day earlier at the farm in the southeastern county of Yecheon, 165 kilometers southeast of Seoul, with the authorities confirming the highly pathogenic strain of H5N1. Han has ordered the agriculture minister to carry out "the preventive culling within a 500-meter radius and swiftly implement containment measures," the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement. Han also instructed officials to thoroughly implement other preventive steps, including restricting movement and disinfecting farms and roads in Yecheon, according to the statement. Upon the report, the authorities have cordoned off the farm and implemented containment measures, including the culling of some 9,800 ducks raised there.Korea had last reported an avian influenza case in April.

Though the Knuckle Bump Farms resident is still hanging in there, the bird flu has already killed about 50 of the other birds on the farm.Article continues below advertisementKnuckle Bump Farms did not immediately respond to Green Matters’ request for comment, and owner Taylor Blake tweeted that she is not doing news interviews right now, as she is exhausted from dealing with the situation on her farm. That said, here’s what we know so far about the condition of Emmanuel and the farm’s other birds.Article continues below advertisementThe avian flu has killed more than 50 birds on Knuckle Bump Farms.On Saturday, Oct. 15, Taylor Blake, who runs Knuckle Bump Farms, began to share Emmanuel’s story on Twitter, explaining that she had “a massive tragedy strike the farm.”“Not many people are aware of the dangers that wild birds pose to domesticated birds. Wild birds carry and transmit a deadly virus known as avian influenza,” Blake explained in a tweet thread. “Our farm was heavily impacted by wild geese bringing in AI, and we lost 99 percent of the birds on our farm.”She then explained that this issue began when a flock of about 50 wild Egyptian geese started flying onto the Florida-based farm every day — and even when the staff would try to chase them away, they would return overnight.Article continues below advertisement“Not many people are aware of the dangers that wild birds pose to domesticated birds,” she added. According to NBC News, geese and other wild birds can carry the avian flu, and via their saliva, mucus, feces, they can pass the virus onto other birds, including domesticated ones.Soon, nearly every bird on the farm was affected by the disease. Within three days, Blake claims that it killed 99 percent of Knuckle Bump Farms’ birds — a total of more than 50 birds, including chickens, ducks, geese, black swans, and turkeys.Article continues below advertisementEmmanuel the emu has contracted the avian flu.As of Oct. 15, only two birds were still alive on the farm: Rico and Emmanuel, the latter of whom is Knuckle Bump Farms’ most famous inhabitant. However, Emmanuel also contracted the avian flu, and for the past few days, Blake has been “treating him around the clock.”“I will do anything and go into any amount of debt to save his life,” Blake wrote on Saturday, adding that she was working with a vet and an avian flu specialist, as well as following all FDA-recommended advice to prevent the flu from spreading any further.Article continues below advertisementOver the past few days, Blake has kept her 898,000 Twitter followers up to date on Emmanuel’s symptoms and injuries as related to the flu, which include nerve damage — and as of today, Oct. 19, Emmanuel is “getting stronger every day.” He has been doing physical therapy, he is trying to stand up on his own, and the avian specialist was "incredibly impressed with his demeanor and vitals" on Monday. She took blood from Emmanuel, and tests should be coming back shortly.Article continues below advertisementThe avian flu affects different bird species differently — and in rare cases, it can infect humans. As explained by NPR, the avian flu typically kills chickens and turkeys very quickly, but certain wild marine bird species can simply be carriers of the virus and survive it — which explains why Emmanuel is still holding on.Though there have been a few documented cases of humans contracting the bird flu, humans generally do not need to worry about being impacted by the virus, unless they are in direct contact with affected birds. In fact, experts have warned that there’s always the chance that the next human pandemic could be born from the bird flu, as per NPR. Blake is following all regulations, including quarantining, to ensure the virus does not leave Knuckle Bump Farms.It’s clear how much Blake loves Emmanuel, and we hope he makes a full recovery — and gets back to hilariously interrupting Blake’s TikTok videos — very soon.AdvertisementMore from Green MattersThis Emu Is Ready for His Close Up and Has Gone Viral on TikTokTikTok's Mommy Farmer Says Her Corgi Boone Was "Intentionally Killed"Why Everyone Should “Adopt Don’t Shop”Latest Pets News and UpdatesAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementABOUT Green MattersAbout UsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseDMCASitemapCONNECT with Green MattersLink to FacebookLink to XLink to InstagramContact us by EmailOpt-out of personalized ads© Copyright 2024 Engrost, Inc.

Read our privacy policyVirologists said they were left shocked after viral social media posts from an influencer and farm owner showed her cuddling TikTok’s most famous emu, lovingly called Emmanuel Todd Lopez, after it contracted avian flu.Experts are warning US farmers to cease cuddling and coming in close contact with infected birds, saying it could be “extremely dangerous”.One expert has said this was “no different than exposure to bird flu from a bird market or wet market anywhere in the world”.The warnings have come after an outpouring of sorrow and support for Taylor Blake, an influencer, whose family-owned bird farm in Florida, Knuckle Bump Farms, came under attack from the disease and led to the deaths of 50 birds.Among the birds that got the disease, but are still alive, is Emmanuel the emu.RecommendedTikTok star Emmanuel the emu fighting for life amid avian flu outbreak, caretaker says Bird flu prevention zone declared across Britain in ‘devastating’ outbreakBird flu case prompts Omaha zoo to close several exhibits“I am still trying to wrap my head around it,” Ms Blake wrote. “We thought we were out of the woods, when Emmanuel unexpectedly went down this past Wednesday.”The Twitter thread is going viral as Emmanuel had earlier become the most-followed bird on TikTok for constantly interrupting Ms Blake’s video recordings and pecking at her phone. The farm’s TikTok account has collected more than 2.4 million followers.Emmanuel, the TikTok star emu, is fighting for his life amid avian flu outbreak (Twitter / Taylor Blake)Ms Blake said she is looking for avian specialists who can treat Emmanuel for nerve damage in his right leg and foot, saying she could “do anything and go into any amount of debt to save his life”.But even as social media users were left “devastated” by the news, several virologists and veterinarians have raised an alarm over the photos shared by Ms Blake who was seen cuddling, kissing and hugging the infected bird.“This is how zoonotic transmissions occur, this is why entire farms cull sick birds. We live with the threat of pandemic flu,” wrote Boghuma Kabisen Titanij, a doctor and global health and infectious disease researcher at Emory University.“This may seem cute but it’s no different than exposure to bird flu from a bird market or wet market anywhere else in the world. It carries a risk and the public should be educated on this,” she added.American virologist Angela Rasmussen said she “screamed” when she saw the photos and urged people to not cuddle, touch or kiss birds with avian flu as this could be “extremely dangerous to humans and other animals”.She also suggested euthanasia for birds infected with the dangerous flu.Another virologist, Tom Peacock, who works as a flu researcher at Imperial College, London, wrote a lengthy Twitter thread that began with a reiteration of his colleagues’s warnings, telling people to not touch or attempt to treat infected or dead birds.“We are entering the third year of unprecedented levels of circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in Europe - the culprit is H5N1 - similar viruses are causing the current outbreaks in North America as well,” he wrote in another tweet.“There have also been several human infections, among poultry workers and keepers. It is highly likely as this epizootic continues there will be further cases,” he said.When asked about the number of birds to human transmission, he said that while “in the current outbreak there have been very few cases”, earlier avian flu epidemics “have ended with hundreds of human deaths”.Ms Blake, in another tweet, has said she was taking “every precaution recommended by the FDA”, was “fully compliant with the state” and said Knuckle Bump farms was put in a “complete quarantine for 150 days”.But she also added that “Emmanuel freaks out whenever we approach him wearing a mask”, but said that she and her girlfriend have isolated the emu and also sanitise themselves “before and after entering and exiting his stall”.According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), a highly infectious strain of avian influenza has claimed lives of millions of wild birds and domestic poultry as the particular strain is spreading across the US.RecommendedTwo gibbons escape zoo enclosure as visitors evacuated during ‘amber alert’Nearly 3 million birds culled as UK grapples with ‘unprecedented’ wave of bird fluIt also confirmed one case of human transmission in May. The person from Colorado caught it from a commercial poultry facility and has since recovered.While transmission to humans is rare, people can contract the disease if “the virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled,” according to the CDC.More aboutbird fluUSavian fluTikTokEmusFloridaJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/1Virologists warn farmer not to cuddle emu that is dying of bird fluVirologists warn farmer not to cuddle emu that is dying of bird fluEmmanuel, the TikTok star emu, is fighting for his life amid avian flu outbreakTwitter / Taylor Blake ✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)Social SharingPrime Minister Justin Trudeau is urging Canadians to get their influenza and COVID-19 vaccines soon to avoid the need for additional health measures this winter.Speaking at an announcement in Kanata, Ont. on Monday, Trudeau encouraged Canadians to ensure they receive the full complement of COVID-19 and seasonal flu vaccines."If we are able to get a high enough of level of vaccination, we reduce the danger of having to take other health measures to make sure that we're all safe and not overloading our hospitals," Trudeau said.Ontario opens bivalent boosters to those aged 12 and over as indicators show COVID-19 on the riseHis remarks came as health officials express concerns over recent upward trends in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore said last week that he'll recommend the return of mask mandates if the province's health care system becomes too strained.In much of the country, emergency rooms are hovering above full capacity.COVID-19 vaccinations stall, high flu circulation expectedThe share of the population that has received the primary series of a COVID-19 vaccine — one or two doses, depending on the product — has levelled out at around 80 per cent since February. About 49 per cent of Canadians have received the primary series and one additional booster.The National Advisory Committee on Immunization issued a "strong" recommendation that everyone aged 12 and older be offered a fall COVID-19 booster dose, regardless of the number of booster doses previously received. (Robert Short/CBC)Ontario opened appointments Monday for everyone aged 12 and over to receive Omicron-targeted vaccine doses. Earlier this month, Health Canada approved an updated Pfizer BioNTech Comirnaty vaccine that targets the most common variants of the virus currently in the country."There are new formulations that cover both Omicron and the original strain of COVID," Trudeau said. "We encourage everyone to get those vaccinations to keep pressure off of our hospitals, off our frontline heroes who are working so hard to keep people safe, but also to keep pressure off of our economy and our communities."Kids at higher risk of catching flu this season, experts warnIn a statement released earlier this month, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization issued a recommendation that everyone aged 12 and older be offered a fall COVID-19 booster dose, regardless of the number of booster doses previously received.The committee also said its "preferred" product for booster doses is a bivalent Omicron-containing mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.With cold weather approaching, relatively low flu circulation over the last two years puts children at a greater risk than usual of catching the illness, infectious disease experts have told CBC.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

The outbreaks were confirmed yesterday (Wednesday, October 20) in Norfolk, which has been plagued by the disease for weeks, and in Yorkshire and Lancashire. The latter two cases show that the disease has travelled somewhat north, as the majority of cases in the 2022/2023 bird flu season have been in southeast and east England so far. Six outbreaks were confirmed at sites in southeast England on Tuesday (October 18) alone. Advertisement The outbreaks The disease was found in commercial poultry at one site near Leyland, South Ribble in Lancashire and another near Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire. A fourth premises near Wymondham, South Norfolk, and a fifth premises near Dereham, Breckland in Norfolk have had the presence of bird flu confirmed on their sites too. In line with bird flu protocol, 3km Protection Zones and 10km Surveillance Zones have been declared around each of the premises. All poultry on the premises will be humanely culled. Advertisement Bird flu in England Since October 1, 2022, there have been 53 cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) in England. The disease has also been confirmed in Wales and Northern Ireland. To help mitigate the spread of the disease, an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) has been put in place across the UK. Under the AIPZ, it is a legal requirement for all bird keepers to follow strict biosecurity measures to help protect their flocks from the threat of the disease.

Nav opener/closer Zoom inZoom outResetContrastHelp Main navigation Our Services A to Z In your area News Work for Us My account Rakegate pupils become Flu Fighters to join the battle this winter Breadcrumb Home News Rakegate pupils become Flu Fighters to join the battle this winter Pupils at Rakegate Primary School are among the first in Wolverhampton to have become Flu Fighters after receiving their free influenza vaccinations last week. This year, all children from Reception to Year 9 are eligible for the vaccination, which is safe, effective and delivered via a nasal spray, not a needle. Vaccinations will be given by nurses from Vaccination UK in school, starting with primary aged children first. Schools are providing information about the vaccine to families of eligible children now, and parents and guardians are asked to give consent online to ensure their child doesn't miss out. Consent forms are available at Vaccination UK, and must be completed at least 48 hours before vaccinations are due to be given in school. Vaccination UK nurses were at Rakegate Primary School in Oxley on Friday (14 October 2022), and Headteacher Sarah Horton said: "As a school we are supporting the child flu vaccination programme, and feel it is important that as many children receive this as possible. "The flu vaccine will help to reduce the risk of our children getting or spreading flu to friends and family who are at greater risk, for example, grandparents or people with underlying health conditions. It will also help prevent our children becoming unwell with flu and needing time off school, causing disruption to their learning." Councillor Jasbir Jaspal, the City of Wolverhampton Council's Cabinet Member for Public Health and Wellbeing, said: "I was delighted to be able to join the children at Rakegate Primary School as they received their vaccinations on Friday. "Flu can be deadly and easily spread by children and adults, and the free vaccine is the best way to protect our children and other family members. "Vaccinations are continuing in schools throughout Wolverhampton over the next couple of months, and I would encourage parents and guardians to complete their consent form as soon as possible, so their children – like those at Rakegate – can become Flu Fighters this autumn." Children aged 2 and 3, and children with some long term health conditions, are also eligible for the nasal spray, with their vaccinations given at their local GP surgery. The vaccination is available by injection if parents do not wish their child to have the nasal spray, or if children are unable to have it for medical reasons, for instance if they have a supressed immune system or severe egg allergy.
