Vaccine Types: There are different types of flu vaccines available, including flu shots, trivalent flu vaccines, high-dose flu vaccines, cell-based flu vaccines, nasal spray flu vaccines, and flu vaccination by jet injector. Each type offers protection against specific groups of influenza Type A and B viruses.
Vaccine Recommendations: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides recommendations for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines. These recommendations are updated annually to reflect the most common influenza viruses expected during the upcoming season.
Vaccine Effectiveness: Influenza vaccines cause the development of antibodies in the body, which provide protection against infection with the influenza viruses used to make the vaccine. It typically takes about two weeks after vaccination for the antibodies to develop.
Protection against Common Strains: The seasonal flu vaccine is designed to protect against the influenza viruses that research suggests will be most common during the upcoming flu season. This includes three different main groups of influenza Type A and B viruses.
High-Dose Vaccine for Older Adults: The high-dose flu vaccine, called Fluzone High-Dose, contains four times the amount of antigen as a regular flu shot, providing a stronger immune response. It is specifically approved for use in individuals aged 65 years and older.
Cell-Based and Egg-Free Vaccines: Some flu vaccines, such as the cell-based vaccines grown in mammal cell culture and the egg-free nasal spray flu vaccine, offer alternatives for individuals with specific allergies or preferences. These vaccines are approved for use in specific age groups.
Jet Injector Vaccination: Flu vaccination via a jet injector, such as Afluria, is approved for use in individuals aged 18 through 64 years. Those under 18 and over 64 years old can only receive this vaccine with a needle.
Nasal Spray Flu Vaccine: The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also known as FluMist, is given as a nasal spray. It is made with weakened live influenza viruses and is approved for use in individuals aged 2 through 49 years.
Recommendations for Vaccination: It is important to follow the recommendations of healthcare professionals and public health organizations regarding flu vaccination. These recommendations take into account factors such as age, health conditions, and vaccine availability to optimize protection against influenza.
