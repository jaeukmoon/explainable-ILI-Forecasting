The early detection and prediction of influenza outbreaks are crucial for efficient resource planning to save patient’s lives and healthcare costs. We propose a new data-driven methodology for influenza outbreak detection and prediction at very local levels. A doctor’s diagnostic dataset of influenza-like illness from more than 3000 clinics in Malaysia is used in this study because these diagnostic data are reliable and can be captured promptly. A new region index (RI) of the influenza outbreak is proposed based on the diagnostic dataset. By analysing the anomalies in the weekly RI value, potential outbreaks are identified using statistical methods. An ensemble learning method is developed to predict potential influenza outbreaks. Cross-validation is conducted to optimize the hyperparameters of the ensemble model. A testing data set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model. The proposed methodology is shown to be sensitive and accurate at influenza outbreak prediction, with average of 75% recall, 74% precision, and 83% accuracy scores across five regions in Malaysia. The results are also validated by Google Flu Trends data, news reports, and surveillance data released by World Health Organization.

Influenza is one of them1. Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection that causes diseases ranging from mild respiratory tract infection (RTI) to severe pneumonia and even death. Worldwide, seasonal influenza leads to an estimated 5 million cases of severe illness and 650,000 respiratory deaths every year2. It also causes a significant hospitalization burden, workplace absences, and productivity losses. For example, based on a study conducted at the University of Malaya Medical Centre in Malaysia in 2009, the direct healthcare cost for each hospitalized H1N1 patient was USD 510, which was 60% higher than the year 2007 per capita national expenditure on health of USD 3183. Given these circumstances, investigators are working on detecting and predicting influenza outbreaks early. This prediction would bring tremendous value to the world’s healthcare systems. Firstly, the early detection of influenza outbreaks is crucial to the healthcare system to enable efficient resource planning and save healthcare costs. Secondly, early detection can potentially help save people’s lives. Thirdly, we can control the spread of influenza if we can predict it early.Traditional surveillance is widely used to monitor anomalies in influenza-like illness (ILI) cases in selected hospitals or clinics. For example, in Malaysia, the Ministry of Health designs and deploys a system to monitor national influenza status efficiently at a low cost. One to two clinics are selected per state as sentinel sites to conduct both clinical-based and laboratory-based surveillance4. However, this traditional surveillance method used in Malaysia requires weeks or even months to gather, process, report, and finally release the surveillance data through WHO5,6,7. In addition, with only fifteen hospitals or clinics monitored4, the national ILI trend may not be captured accurately due to the small sample size and low coverage.In recent years, there have been more research papers on influenza outbreak prediction. Many papers built prediction models based on historical ILI case data from traditional surveillance or WHO reports. These data had the limitations such as low geographic coverage and small sample size. Other papers used simulated data or Google Flu Trends (GFT) data. GFT was launched in 2008 to provide estimated influenza activities using Google searches8. GFT provided near real-time estimates of seasonal influenza activity each day and stimulated many innovative research projects.In 2013, Dugas9 developed a model to forecast influenza cases number based on influenza data from one medical center. It was shown that the generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GARMA) model with Negative Binomial distribution integrating GFT information provided the highest influenza case forecast confidence at 83%. The model aims to provide advanced warning of future influenza cases for medical centers. However, it was tested on only one medical centre. Hence, its geographic generalizability must be further evaluated.García10 used Bayesian model selection and Bayesian regression to detect outbreaks of ILI using surveillance data in 2015. Their method was applied to both Spanish influenza outbreaks in San Francisco, USA, in 1918 and acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) from San Luis Potosí, Mexico, for validation. The paper claimed to have accurate and consistent predictions. However, the model performance evaluation was based on observations and lacked statistical measure reporting.Bédubourg11 compared different statistical methods for early temporal detection of outbreaks by using R package surveillance on simulated data generated using a negative binomial model. Among all the models, the CUSUM generalized linear model (GLM) gave the best recall at 79.5% but had a very low precision value at 9.9%. Periodic Neg Binomial GLM gave the best precision value at 68.4% but had a very low recall value of 20.7%. All the tested models struggled to reach a high balanced score for both precision and recall. Therefore, they were either insensitive, missing out on real outbreaks, or overreacting to give many false alarms.In 2019, Zhang13 combined GFT together with surveillance data FluNet published by WHO and developed a multivariate seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model to track influenza epidemics in Australia, China, the USA, and the UK . In 2020, Darwish12 investigated the performance of three different feature spaces in different models to forecast the weekly ILI rate in Syria using Early Warning, Alert and Response System (EWARS) data from WHO. Both papers showed promising results. However, similar to traditional surveillance conducted by the government, the published WHO data could be delayed by several weeks or months.In this paper, we propose a new data-driven methodology to detect and predict influenza outbreaks. A near real-time diagnostic dataset is used in this study, which covers information from over three thousand clinics in Malaysia. A new region index (RI) is developed to capture the ILI trend in the regions. By analysing the anomalies in the weekly RI value, potential outbreaks are identified using statistical methods. An ensemble learning method is developed to predict potential influenza outbreaks. Cross-validation is conducted to evaluate the prediction model performance. The proposed methodology is shown to be sensitive and accurate at influenza outbreak prediction, with around 80% accuracy, 75% recall, and 75% precision scores. It is also validated further with publicly available information, including the GFT data, news, and WHO FluNet data6,7.MethodsDataFor this study, a dataset was provided by Zuellig Pharma, covering over 3000 clinics’ diagnostic records in their Malaysia clinic partner network. The dataset consists of approximately two million ILI case records from 4 Jan 2016 to 21 July 2019 with patient diagnostic details, such as the patient ID, diagnosis, prescription drugs, visiting date, etc. The pre-processing of diagnostic data is required to filter the relevant ILI data, because the raw dataset contains data from all types of illnesses. In this study, the ILI data were identified by ICD10 codes, the international classification of diseases codes used by the WHO14. To sound an early alarm on influenza outbreaks, both confirmed cases and early symptoms are considered. Table 1 shows the ICD10 codes used to filter the ILI data from the original diagnostic dataset.Table 1 ICD10 Code and ILI Diagnosis.Full size tableAll the diagnostic data are collected automatically and refreshed in real time. The data can be aggregated into different frequencies, e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly. Similar to past surveillance systems, weekly data are used in this study. We aggregate the data by clinic and count the number of weekly ILI cases. So that, we can detect the weekly outbreak status and predict whether the next coming week will bring an outbreak. Our approach can provide outbreak alerts several weeks earlier than official reports from traditional surveillance methods.Region Index (RI)As the data is from the clinic partner network, it is common for new clinics to join the partner network from time to time. Therefore, the number of clinics in the dataset might be different over time. In addition, the clinics’ size could be varied from tens of patient visits a week to hundreds of patient visits a week. To study the regional influenza outbreak, we introduce the RI, a metric that normalizes the impact of the weekly number of clinics and the clinic size. Using the diagnostic data from the clinics, we have the flexibility to decide on the granularity of the regions by grouping the clinics based on geographic location. In this paper, we define five regions in Malaysia by following the definition used by the Malaysia Federal Department of Town and Country (Table 2)18. All clinics are segmented into five regions: the Central, East Coast, East Malaysia, Northern, and Southern regions (Fig. 1). After segmentation, each of the regions still has good coverage for the number of clinics and the number of ILI cases (Table 2). In a paper by Santillana25, the influenza surveillance for ten regions in the USA was studied and analysed independently. With the same concept, we will study each of the five regions independently in this paper.Table 2 Definition of the Five Regions in Malaysia18.Full size tableFigure 1Five Regions in Malaysia (generated using Tableau version 2020.3.2) (https://www.tableau.com/supporteleases/desktop/2020.3.2).Full size imageThe following data preparation step is to calculate RI for each of the five regions weekly. The mathematical definition of RI is shown in Equation (1). Table 3 shows an example of the regional RI.$$\begin{aligned} R_{j,r}=\frac{\sum _{i=1}^{n_{j,r}} N_{i,j,r}}{\sum _{i=1}^{n_{j,r}} S_{i,j,r}} \text { , } j \ge 1 \end{aligned}$$ (1) where \(R_{j,r}\) is Region Index (RI) at week j of region rr \(\in \) {Central, East Coast, East Malaysia, Northern, Southern} (Table 2)\(N_{i,j,r}\) is number of ILI cases of clinic i at week j of region r\(n_{j,r}\) is number of clinics at week j of region r\(S_{i,j,r}\) is average size of the clinic i at week j of region r as defined in Equation (2)$$\begin{aligned} S_{i,j} = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \frac{\sum _{J=k}^{J=j-1} N_{i,J}}{j-k} &{} \text {if } j > 1 ; (k \,\text { is the week number that clinic }\, i \,\text {joined the partnership)} \\ N_{i,1} &{} \text {if } j=1 \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$ (2) In Malaysia, no publicly available dataset contains all the clinics or hospitals. The data we use contain partner clinics, which may be of different sizes and may have joined the partnership at different times. By averaging the clinic sizes and normalizing based on this average number, we can avoid biases from missing data.Table 3 Regional Index (RI) of Diagnostic Data.Full size tableInfluenza outbreaks detection methodThe RI had normalized the original ILI cases for each week and each region. A histogram is plotted below to show the distribution of RI, which is close to a normal distribution (Fig. 2). Next, we will apply anomaly detection models to label the regional outbreak on a weekly basis. From the past research papers19,20,21, the 70th and 90th percentiles are often used on normalized ILI cases to identify weak and strong indications of influenza outbreaks. Applying these thresholds to the data, \(RI\ge 1.05\) and \(RI \ge 1.2\) give weak and strong indications of influenza outbreaks at the 70th and 90th percentiles, respectively (Table 4). In the example illustration plot for the southern region, the weeks in the pink range represent strong indications of influenza outbreaks above the 90th percentile; the weeks in the light pink range represent weak indications of influenza outbreaks between the 70th and 90th percentiles (Fig. 3).Figure 2Histogram of RIs.Full size imageTable 4 Weekly RIs statistics Summary.Full size tableFigure 3Example: Apply \(70\%\) and \(90\%\) threshold to Southern region’s RIs.Full size imageThese thresholds are used to design the anomaly detection models. The majority (\(70\%\)) of the RIs were below RI=1.05, representing a normal situation. A RI=1.05 will be used as the minimum requirement for a week to be labelled as an outbreak. (Equation (10)). A RI=1.2 is applied in one of the anomaly detection models. (Equation (3)).Anomaly detection modelsWe consider influenza outbreaks as anomalies in the weekly RI values. To identify the anomalies, we use two types of statistical methods, including five statistical models (Table 5). The type A method is focused on detecting the anomalies over the statistical upper bound of the dataset, and the type B method identifies the abrupt growth in the time-series data. The type B method complements the type A method when the base values are low. The details of the anomaly detection models are described below. Here we use \(O_{j,r,i}\) as the anomaly label at week j in the region r using model i. The southern region is used as an example, in which labelled weeks are plotted in red triangles for each of the five models (Fig. 4).Table 5 Five Statistics Models used for Anomaly Detection.Full size table Model 1: Simple Threshold The first model is the simple threshold model. The anomaly label using the simple threshold model is given in Equation (3). RI=1.2 is selected as the threshold to give a 90% confidence interval (Table 4). This RI indicates that the labelled weeks have at least 20% more ILI cases than the historical average. $$\begin{aligned} O_{j,r,1} = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &{} \text {if } R_{j,r} \ge 1.2\\ 0 &{} \text {else} \end{array}\right. } \text { , } j \ge 1 \end{aligned}$$ (3) Model 2: Z-score Model In the Z-score model, the anomaly label is given in Equation (4). In each region, the \(\mu \) and the \(\sigma \) are the mean and the standard deviation of the RIs every half-year. p=1.3 is used for the 90th percentile (Equation (5)). $$\begin{aligned} O_{j,r,2} = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &{} \text {if } R_{j,r} \ge \mu + p * \sigma \\ 0 &{} \text {else} \end{array}\right. } \text { , } j \ge 1 \end{aligned}$$ (4) $$\begin{aligned} \Pr (O_{j,r,2} = 1) = 1 - Z_{score}(p) \end{aligned}$$ (5) where:\(\mu \) is the mean of the RIs for each of the half-year (26 weeks) windows\(\sigma \) is the standard deviation of the RIs for each of the half-year (26 weeks) windowsp is a constant. In this paper \(p=1.3\) is used to obtain a \(90\%\) confidence interval using Equation (5) Model 3: Tukey’s Model The anomaly label using Tukey’s model is given in Equation (6). The confidence interval is computed using the quantiles of the RIs every half-year. Here, we use q=0.4 for the 90% confidence interval (Equation (7)). $$\begin{aligned} O_{j,r,3} = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &{} \text {if } R_{j,r} \ge Q75 + q \times IQR \\ 0 &{} \text {else} \end{array}\right. } \text { , } j \ge 1 \end{aligned}$$ (6) $$\begin{aligned} \Pr (O_{j,r,3} = 1) \xrightarrow [\text {}]{\text {normal approximation }} 1 - Z_{score}(0.6745 + q * 1.35) \end{aligned}$$ (7) where Q75 is the 75th-Percentile of the RIs of the half-year (26 weeks) windowsIQR is the Z-score interquartile range of the RIs of the half-year (26 weeks) windowsq is a constant. In this paper \(q=0.4\) is used to obatain a \(90\%\) confidence interval using Equation (7) Model 4: Growth Value The fourth model uses the RI growth value as a measurement to identify the abruptly growing RIs. The anomaly label using the growth value is given in Equation (8). This values indicates that the labelled weeks have RI growth values exceeding the median of the positive growth values. $$\begin{aligned} O_{j,r,4} = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &{} \text {if } R_{j,r} - R_{j-1,r} \ge median(R_{J,r} - R_{J-1,r}) \text { where } R_{J,r} > R_{J-1,r}\\ 0 &{} \text {else} \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$ (8) Model 5: Growth Rate The fifth model uses the RI growth rate as a measurement to identify abruptly growing RIs. The anomaly label using the growth rate is given in Equation (9). This rate indicates that the labelled weeks have an RI growth rate exceeding 10%. $$\begin{aligned} O_{j,r,5} = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &{} \text {if } \frac{R_{j,r} - R_{j-1,r}}{R_{j-1,r}} \ge 10\% \\ 0 &{} \text {else} \end{array}\right. } \text { , } j > 1 \end{aligned}$$ (9) Figure 4Outlier lables from five Statistics Models.Full size imageOutbreak labellingThe weekly outbreak labelling in each region is performed in two steps, as given by Equation (10) and (11) respectively. An illustration of this labelling process is shown in Fig. 5.In the first step (Equation (10)), as long as one of the five anomaly detection models detects the anomaly, the week will be labelled as an outbreak. Because the five models complemented each other in anomaly detection, they increased the sensitivity of the influenza outbreak detection. Note that an \(R_{j,r}\) greater than 1.05 from the 70th percentile is imposed, so that the weeks labelled as outbreaks were at least \(5\%\) more frequent in ILI cases than the historical average to avoid over-labelling.In the second step (Equation (11)), a two-week outbreak window is proposed in this paper. This is because the development of an infectious disease outbreak takes some time. Based on our study of the historical diagnostic dataset, for any region r that starts to show a strong indication of an outbreak in weeks \(j-1\), the next week j will be considered as a continuity of the previous outbreak. In accordance with the empirical observation, this paper defines the start of an influenza outbreak as a two-week period.$$\begin{aligned} I_{j,r} = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &{} \text {if } R_{j,r} \ge 1.05 \text { and } {\sum }_{m=1}^{m=5} O_{j,r,m} \ge 1 \\ 0 &{} \text {else} \end{array}\right. } \text { , } j \ge 1 \end{aligned}$$ (10) where:\(I_{j,r}\) is the influenza outbreak indicator at week j of Region r,1 means outbreak, and 0 means non-outbreak$$\begin{aligned} I_{j,r} = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &{} \text {if } I_{j-1,r} =1\\ I_{j,r} &{} \text {else} \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$ (11) Figure 5Influenza outbreak detection for historical data illustration.Full size imageInfluenza outbreaks prediction methodWith the labelled influenza outbreak data (Table 6), we develop an ensemble learning method26 to predict future outbreaks.Table 6 Diagnostic data with labelled influenza outbreaks.Full size tableFeature generation—Focus on prior outbreak patternIn supervised learning, feature X in response Y relationship must be constructed to train the model using historical data. Then, given a new X, the model can predict the corresponding Y. In this paper, response Y is the outbreak indicator of the next week. Feature X is constructed as the RI patterns of w weeks prior. Here, w is a parameter. This feature-response construction allows the model to address patterns before an outbreak.Assuming there are n weeks of historical data available, Table 6 can be reformatted into Table 7 for each region r. The feature set X to respond to Y construction is shown in Equation (12) for historical data. In each region r, X takes the past w weeks’ RI, and Y is the influenza outbreak indicator. The same construction works to predict future outbreaks, as shown in Equation (13). Given the known \(X_{n-w+1}\), i.e., the most recent w weeks’ RI from the historical data, the classification model predicts unknown \(Y_{n-w+1}\), i.e., the outbreak indicator of the next week.Note that the (X, Y) pairs are mutually independent. It has been assumed that the outbreak indicator of week j only depends on the RI pattern of the week j-w to week j-1. In other words, it is the week j-w to week j-1’s RI pattern that decides whether week j is an outbreak. That is why parameter w must be selected with care. We will discuss the use of cross-validation to select the optimal value for parameter w.Table 7 Reformat of Table 6 for Each Region r.Full size table$$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} (X_u, Y_u) = ((R_u, R_{u+1},..., R_{w+u-1}) , (I_{w+u})) \text { for } 1 \le u \le n-w \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (12) where:\(X_u\) is the feature constructed at week \(w+u\), which is composed of RIs from w weeks prior\(Y_u\) is the response at week \(w+u\), which is the outbreak indicator$$\begin{aligned} (X_{n-w+1}, Y_{n-w+1}) = ((R_{n-w+1}, R_{n-w+2},..., R_{n}) , (I_{n+1})) \end{aligned}$$ (13) Model designResponse Y, the outbreak indicator, is a 1/0 binary variable, where 1 represents outbreaks and 0 represents non-outbreaks. This paper uses an ensemble learning method with a support vector machine (SVM) and Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB) and a simple OR function as the combiner26. The pseudocode of the ensemble learning method is shown in Algorithm 1.SVM is selected because it fits perfectly into the paper’s problem setup. As it is widely known, SVM can be used in supervised learning, which plots each example X as points in space. Its aim is to find a hyperplane to separate the points by category Y as widely as possible. With the hyperplane, new example X entering the space will fall to one side of the hyperplane, therefore being predicted to belong to a category Y. The same concept is then applied to the data structure defined in section ”Feature Generation - Focus on Prior Outbreak Pattern”. For features constructed using historical data as described in Equation (12), each example X is a point in space. SVM aims to find a hyperplane to separate Y=1 outbreaks from Y=0 non-outbreaks as widely as possible. With the hyperplane, the Equation (13) new X (X is the last W weeks RI) entering the space will be categorized to be either Y=1 or Y=0 (Y is the prediction for next week’s outbreak indicator).SVM might fail to separate outbreak cases from non-outbreak cases if the pattern for Y is not so distinct. If relying purely on SVM, it might lead to false negative predictions that the model may fail to capture all outbreaks correctly. In this paper, we select one more classification model to complement the SVM model, GNB. GNB can be applied because we have shown that the RI value follows a Gaussian distribution (Figure 2). It uses Bayes theorem for prediction using conditional probability function and is able to capture outbreaks that SVM might miss out from a different angle.Model training and parameter tuningTo build a robust prediction model and provide an unbiased performance evaluation of the final model, we divide the whole data set into training, validation, and test data sets. 15% of the data are set aside as a test dataset. The remaining 85% of the data are used in a cross-validation process, which is further split into training (70%) and validation (30%) data. Details about the cross-validation process using repeated random sub-sampling27 are described in Algorithm 2 (Fig. 6) to optimize the hyperparameter w and SVM kernel.Figure 6Cross-validation architecture.Full size imageThree evaluation metrics are selected to be reported for model performance evaluation in this paper. 1. Recall score as the primary metrics aiming to find all real outbreaks The recall score measures how sensitive the model is at reporting actual outbreaks, i.e., how many real outbreaks are being predicted correctly by the model. The primary purpose of the project is to detect potential outbreaks early and not miss any actual outbreaks. The historical data are imbalanced in the outbreak indicator labelling, and there are many more 0s (non-outbreak weeks) than 1s (outbreak weeks). Therefore, the recall score is the optimal option for evaluating the sensitivity of the model in identifying real outbreaks. The recall score is used in the cross-validation process for parameter tuning and to increase the model sensitivity. 2. Precision score to ensure predicted outbreaks are real outbreaks The precision score measures the precision of the model in reporting outbreaks, i.e., for all the weeks predicted as an outbreak by the model, how many are real outbreaks. The precision score is reported together with the recall score during cross-validation to avoid over-labelling of the outbreaks. It is also reported as the confidence level of the prediction result, indicating the probability of the predicted outbreak being a real outbreak. 3. Accuracy score for reference Accuracy is the most intuitive performance measure. Due to the nature of imbalanced data, the accuracy is quite high in general. Therefore, it is reported just for reference. We use Algorithm 2 to select the best hyperparameters for the prediction model. The cross-validation result of the recall score is shown in Table 8. SVM \(kernel=rbf\) and \(w=3\) are selected as the best parameters, because they provide high, balanced, and stable recall scores across all five regions. Table 9 reports the precision and accuracy scores on top of the recall scores for the selected best hyperparameters. For all the regions, there are high recall and precision scores and low standard deviations. Once we obtain the optimal hyperparameter set, we use the test data set to measure the final model performance, which is further elaborated in the results section.Table 8 Cross-validation result of recall score.Full size tableTable 9 Detailed Cross-Validation results with optimal parameter: Kernel = rbf, w=3.Full size tableEthical use of dataThe authors confirm that all methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. All the experimental protocols were approved by Zuellig Pharma Holdings Pte Ltd and National University of Singapore. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects by the approving ethics committee. The consent of use of the data for this study by the authors has been provided by Zuellig Pharma Holdings Pte Ltd.ResultsWe compared the model outbreak detection and prediction results with both the WHO and the GFT data. Currently, Malaysia Ministry of Health (MOH) reports ILI cases to WHO based on the traditional surveillance method4. A total of 15 clinics or hospitals in the whole country monitor and report ILI cases to WHO every two weeks or longer. The WHO published weekly influenza data including the total number of specimens processed and the total number of confirmed influenza cases on FluNet7. In this study, we used WHO data to validate the high-level ILI trend at the national level.Although the WHO data is able to show some useful national ILI trends, it is very approximate due to the small sample size. In addition, the WHO data cannot support the detailed weekly analysis at the regional level. Therefore, we compared the regional detection and prediction results with the GFT data. As an example of collective intelligence, GFT has attracted a lot of attention in the past 10 years28,29. On the one hand, GFT unlocked the power of big data in the public health area. It is able to understand the prevalence of influenza at very local levels with more finely granular data from search engines, which is not practical for the traditional surveillance systems to widely produce. In addition, GFT can provide influenza alerts much earlier than the traditional surveillance systems. On the other hand, GFT was challenged by some researchers because its predictions have sometimes been inaccurate. This is because that people making influenza-related Google searches may know very little about how to diagnose influenza. Therefore, searches for influenza or influenza symptoms may well be researching disease symptoms that are similar to influenza but are not influenza.The GFT data are selected in this study for comparison for the following reasons. Firstly, GFT is one of the best public data sources for providing near real-time influenza information at very local levels. GFT can specify search terms and geographic granularity to align with our model at the regional level. We can use ILI-relevant search terms and choose the cities in the same region from GFT to provide the closest comparison with our model results. Secondly, despite its limitations, GFT is still able to provide useful influenza alert information in many cases based on previous research8,28,29. Thirdly, the potential problem of GFT can be identified and rectified as we also use the WHO data to validate the national-level results in this study.Result of the Influenza outbreaks detection methodWe extracted Malaysia’s influenza data from WHO FluNet website7 and computed the influenza rate as the percentage of influenza cases found in all the processed specimens. We calculated the aggregated RI at the national level and compared it with WHO influenza rate data trend. Overall, these national-wide data are aligned and show a similar trend (Fig. 7).Figure 7National level RI vs. WHO weekly influenza rate in the past 1 year.Full size imageTo validate the influenza detection results at the regional levels, GFT data are used. Figure 8 shows an example of the comparison in the southern region. As defined in Table 2, the region is composed of three states: Johor, Melaka, and Negeri Sembilan. The upper graph shows the influenza outbreaks in the southern region as labelled using the approach proposed in this paper (red color indicates outbreaks). The lower graph shows the GFT search index of ILI-relevant terms for the same region. From this comparison, the GFT shows outbreak periods similar to those of our model. However, as we used real ILI case data from more than three thousand clinics while GFT relied on the search results from the general public, our method was able to detect the outbreaks more obviously in most cases while GFT patterns were not so clear in some cases.Figure 8Outbreak detection result vs GFT for the southern region.Full size imageIn Fig. 8, we highlighted three local outbreaks in the southern region, in which GFT also shows distinct spikes in the search index. To further validate the outbreak detection results, we also collected published news reports. In week 27 of 2019 (from 30 June to 6 July), the Selangor Journal reported that ILI cases soared in Negri Sembilan22, which is a state in the southern region. The finding is aligned with the model detection result, as specified in Fig. 8 outbreak period 3. In addition, we compared the time at which our paper gives the signal with that of the GFT for the 3 highlighted outbreaks, as summarized in Table 10. From the comparison, our method could detect the same outbreak during the same week or earlier than the GFT.Table 10 First spike date comparison of this paper’s outbreak detection vs. the GFT for the southern region in sample periods.Full size tableResult of the Influenza outbreaks prediction methodTo provide an unbiased evaluation of the prediction model, we use a testing data set to measure the performance of the model trained early on. The testing data set includes 15% of the total data, which are not used in the model training and validation stage. Model performance results (Table 11) are summarized below. The model is proven to be reliable and stable, with average of 75% recall, 74% precision and 83% accuracy scores across the five regions. (Table 11). The model is sensitive to capturing the real outbreaks, that around 75% of the real outbreaks can be correctly predicted by the model across the five regions (Table 11. Recall). Table 11 Testing Data Set Results with Optimal Parameter: Kernel = rbf, w=3.Full size tableTo further validate the prediction model performance, we predict whether the next week, i.e., week 22 to 28 Jul 2019, would be an outbreak for each of the five regions by using the historical data from 4 Jan 2016 to 21 Jul 2019. The model predicts that East Malaysia would not have an influenza outbreak in the next week, and all the rest of the regions will have an influenza outbreak then (Table 12). To be specific, there is around 88% of probability central will have an outbreak; 60% of probability east coast will have an outbreak; 89% of probability east Malaysia will have an outbreak; 60% of probability northern will be an outbreak; and 71% of probability southern region will have an outbreak (Table 11).Table 12 Predicted Influenza Outbreaks for Next Week 22 to 28 Jul 2019 with Optimal Parameter: Kernel = rbf, w=3 1 represents outbreak, and 0 represents non-outbreak.Full size tableWe also compared the new prediction result with WHO FluMart data in the national level (Fig. 9). It shows that there is a spike around week 30 (22 to 28 Jul 2019), which is consistent with our prediction.Figure 9WHO weekly influenza rate in 2019.Full size imageFrom the GFT data (Fig. 10), we can see that there is also a distinct spike in searches for ’Influenza’ for Malaysia overall in the week of 22 to 28 Jul 2019. This is consistent with the prediction result from our model (Table 12). More specifically at the region level: Northern, southern, central and east coast regions have the top GFT Indexes indicating high influenza searches, which is consistent with the model result that these regions will have an outbreak (Table 12). East Malaysia has the lowest GFT index with the least likelihood of an outbreak, which is consistent with the model result showing 0, no outbreak (Table 12). Figure 10Google Flu Trend Result (week 22 – 28 Jul 2019) (Map screenshot from GFT website23).Full size imageDiscussionThis paper proposes a data-driven methodology using a diagnostic dataset from over 3000 clinics in Malaysia to detect and predict influenza outbreaks at very local levels effectively. The main objective of this study is to provide a good supplement to traditional influenza surveillance systems instead of a replacement. We believe that when our method is deployed in conjunction with traditional surveillance systems and GFT, it will provide better influenza detection and prediction outcomes.During a typical outbreak life-cycle as plotted in Fig. 11, there are three types of datasets that can be used for the influenza outbreak study: Google Trends dataset, diagnostic datasets, and official reports. Diagnostic data stand out for the following reasons. First, they are used to monitor ILI cases based on licensed doctor diagnoses, which are usually more reliable than Google Trends search-based data. Second, diagnostic data provide earlier detection insights into influenza outbreaks compared to the official reports. Andrea validated that diagnostic data from one medical center work well for the influenza case forecasting9. In this study, we used diagnostic data from over three thousand clinics, covering half of the clinics in Malaysia24. We can extend Andrea’s work to address geographic generalizability. In addition, as this dataset is directly extracted from a real-world healthcare system, our methodology can be easily integrated with this system and deployed for daily operations.Figure 11A typical outbreak lifecycle.Full size imageA new measurement metric of influenza outbreaks, i.e., the RI, is proposed in this paper. The RI compares the number of ILI cases during the current week with the historical weekly average in the region. Unlike previous papers13,19,21, which simply use the total number of cases from all hospitals or clinics, the RI uses the average size of individual clinics and handles cases when new clinics are added into or removed from the dataset during the sample period. In statistical terms, the RI eliminates the biases of different clinic sizes and a varying number of clinics. It gives a good indication of whether the current week shows an anomaly in the ILI cases in the region.We designed an influenza outbreak detection method based on RI using statistical outlier detection models and validated the method with GFT results. In real-world scenarios, the sensitivity of the outbreak detection model is crucial because we try to detect as many outbreaks as possible. To improve the sensitivity of outbreak detection methods, we introduce five complementary statistical models in this paper. These models are used to label the weekly regional outbreaks to train the prediction model.This paper emphasizes the study of RI patterns before an outbreak and develops a machine learning model to predict future outbreaks. There are usually two types of methodologies when detecting outbreaks, i.e., regression models and classification models. Regression models focus on seasonal or periodical outbreaks and fit long-term predictions better. By contrast, classification models capture dynamic patterns and fit short-term predictions better. In this paper, we decided to use classification models because Malaysia, which is located in Southeast Asia, does not have distinctive seasons; therefore, there are no clear seasonal trends in ILI cases4. Moreover, we can give early alerts using classification models by learning the patterns right before the outbreaks.The methodology has consistent performances, with average of \(75\%\) recall, \(74\%\) precision, and \(80\%\) accuracy scores on the testing set across five regions in Malaysia. Therefore we conclude that the methodology is sensitive and accurate in predicting influenza outbreaks at very local levels. Compared to previous similar research works, the proposed methodology is more reliable, effective, and scalable to influenza outbreak detection and prediction.In the future, the proposed methodology introduced in this paper can be easily adapted to other diseases covered by diagnostic data, such as hand foot mouth disease, dengue fever, and COVID-19, etc. Moreover, the methodology, as currently predicting at the regional level, can be extended easily to the city level, or any granularity by grouping clinics based on geographic location. In addition to the short-term prediction results presented in this paper, the methodology can be extended for long-term outbreak prediction by restructuring the data and incorporating other machine learning models. In addition, we can apply more complex nonlinear models such as LSTM or other neural networks to the data set to explore if they have better prediction accuracy. ReferencesWorld Health Organization.

Permanente, and the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division June 21, 2021 • By B Traxinger Novel respiratory virusesâsuch as SARS-CoV-2â arise periodically, causing global pandemics of varying severity. Therefore, early pandemic preparedness responses should be put in place for inevitable future outbreaks. Early, community-level mitigation strategies are crucial for decreasing viral transmission, infection, and death. However, the impact and dynamics of city-wide social distancing as an intervention to reduce influenza or respiratory virus spread are unknown. Most previous data has been collected from studying weather-related or routine school closures, which primarily affect children, precluding extrapolation of this data to estimate the effects of social distancing among an entire community. However, the unusually high snowfall in February, 2019 in western Washington State led to widespread school, workplace, and community closures, presenting a unique opportunity to study the effects of short-duration, high-intensity social distancing at the city-wide level. The Seattle Flu Study began during the 2018/2019 influenza season and is a Seattle-area surveillance project aimed at evaluating city-level transmission of influenza and other respiratory pathogens. Under one arm of the study, respiratory swabs taken from community members who sought care at local hospitals for respiratory illness were tested for infection with common respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human corona virus (hCoV), rhinovirus (HRV), and influenza. Dr. Michael L. Jackson (Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute) and colleagues from the Seattle Flu Study and the Fred Hutch Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division used data collected under this arm of the Seattle Flu Study to determine how snowfall-induced social distancing over a short period during 2019 impacted respiratory virus transmission in the Seattle area. They recently published this work in BMC Infectious Diseases. To model the effects of city-wide closures on virus transmission, the authors used the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) frameworkâwhich models virus transmission based on the proportions of community members who are susceptible, infected but not yet infectious, infectious, and recovered and not susceptible, respectivelyâthe authors modeled transmission of nine respiratory viruses between February 3 and 15, 2019. To control for a possible decrease in diagnosis of respiratory infection due to an inability to travel to a hospital during the heavy snowfall, the authors compared traffic and regional hospital data during the snowfall to other dates between January and March 2019 and estimated decreases in traffic and hospital visits in their model. They found that the contact rate, or the rate at which susceptible people (S) become exposed (E), ranged from a 16.2% decrease for coronavirus to a 94.6% decrease for RSV, suggesting that city-wide closures and the resulting social distancing accounted for a large decrease in contacts between people infected with respiratory viruses and those susceptible to become infected, likely resulting in fewer infections. To determine the percent of infections prevented by weather-related, city-wide social distancing, the authors simulated transmission of the nine viruses with and without the decreased contact rates. They found that between 3 and 9.2% of infections, depending on the virus, were averted during this period, suggesting that even short periods of high-intensity social distancing can meaningfully prevent viral spread.

Percentage of the population infected over time for the best fit model (gray) and assuming no weather-related disruption in contact patterns (colored). The solid and dashed black lines mark the beginning and end of weather-related social distancing Image and caption from publication. This study also presented a unique opportunity to study the timing of social distancing on viral transmission. During the 2019 snowfall, influenza A/H1N1 and influenza A/H3N2, the pathogens with the highest incidence in samples collected during the snowfall period, were circulating at different stages in their epidemic dynamics: the snowfall came just before the predicted peak of influenza A/H1N1 transmission, while influenza A/H3N2 was early in the course of the epidemic. Because the decrease in total influenza A/H1N1 infections was much greater than A/H3N2 infection, the authors concluded that city-wide disruption later, near the peak of transmission, has a greater impact on final incidence than does disruption early in an epidemic, which causes an initial decrease in infections that rebounds to an incidence comparable to no disruption. To further interrogate this finding, they next modeled the transmission of influenza A/H3N2 with a 14-day social distancing disruption at various points during the epidemic. Likewise, they found that an early disruption has little effect on final infection rates, while a disruption near the peak of transmission significantly reduces incidence of infection. This work supports previous findings that have shown that social distancing disruptions initiated early in a pandemic have little effect on the final infection incidence, an important consideration for pandemic control measures. These results suggest that, instead, aggressive social distancing measure are best implemented slightly later, closer to peak transmission. Additionally, this study demonstrates that short-term, high-intensity social distancing measures have significant impacts, decreasing contact rates and total infections with respiratory viruses. These findings are important for pandemic response measures for SARS-CoV-2 and inevitable future pandemics, as short-term social distancing may be more feasible to enforce than pandemic-long social distancing, while still preventing a large number of infections. Going forward, intermittent social distancing events could be deployed as a tool to manage disease spread even after viral containment is not possible.

View: Text | PDF Research Article Immunology Canonical features of human antibodies recognizing the influenza hemagglutinin trimer interface Text PDF Abstract Broadly reactive antibodies targeting the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) head domain are thought to be rare and to require extensive somatic mutations or unusual structural features to achieve breadth against divergent HA subtypes. Here we describe common genetic and structural features of protective human antibodies from several individuals recognizing the trimer interface (TI) of the influenza A HA head, a recently identified site of vulnerability. We examined the sequence of TI-reactive antibodies, determined crystal structures for TI antibody–antigen complexes, and analyzed the contact residues of the antibodies on HA to discover common genetic and structural features of TI antibodies. Our data reveal that many TI antibodies are encoded by a light chain variable gene segment incorporating a shared somatic mutation. In addition, these antibodies have a shared acidic residue in the heavy chain despite originating from diverse heavy chain variable gene segments. These studies show that the TI region of influenza A HA is a major antigenic site with conserved structural features that are recognized by a common human B cell public clonotype. The canonical nature of this antibody–antigen interaction suggests that the TI epitope might serve as an important target for structure-based vaccine design. Authors Seth J.

Photograph: David Cheskin/PAFlu This article is more than 3 years oldExplainerIs the UK in for a bumper flu season this winter?This article is more than 3 years oldExperts warn population immunity will have waned, as studies look at combining Covid and flu vaccinesIan Sample Science editorFri 25 Jun 2021 15.50 BSTLast modified on Sat 26 Jun 2021 04.37 BSTShareThe UK is banking on coronavirus vaccines to bring the Covid epidemic under control, but scientists warn that in the autumn and winter another virus, influenza, may bounce back and hit us hard.Why might the next flu season be tough?Flu seasons are bad when virulent strains of the virus meet people with little or no immunity. In the past few years, the UK has experienced relatively low numbers of flu cases, with hardly any in the season just gone because lockdowns and other Covid measures dramatically reduced the spread of influenza. According to the Royal College of General Practitioners, cases of flu in the community were about 95% lower than normal last season.With so little virus in circulation, population immunity will have waned, leaving people more vulnerable to flu when the world reopens and transmission picks up again. There is also more uncertainty over the effectiveness of the flu vaccine this year, because the decision on which strains to include in the shot was taken on fewer samples than usual.How bad could it be?In a typical year, seasonal flu kills about 7,000 people in the UK, with the number of infections up to thousands of times higher. In the season ahead, reduced immunity could double the number of cases we would normally see, according to Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government’s new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group (Nervtag). The potential impact on hospital admissions and deaths is unclear, not least because Covid has already caused a lot of extra deaths among old and frail people. If the UK experiences a serious wave of coronavirus in the winter, there is a chance some Covid restrictions will be reintroduced, or people may switch back to social distancing and mask-wearing voluntarily, all of which will keep influenza rates down.What does it mean for the NHS?The health service always comes under strain in the winter and influenza can be a major factor in the number of people who need hospital care. If influenza bounces back as the country faces a resurgence in coronavirus, there is a risk the NHS will be overwhelmed.Flu could be ‘bigger problem than Covid in UK this winter’Read moreThe NHS may need to sort flu patients from Covid patients to give them different treatments. The antiviral flu drug oseltamivir is most effective when it is given as soon as patients are admitted. “The problem you’ll have with coronavirus and flu around at the same time is: who are the flu guys? You’ve got to give oseltamivir straight away, you don’t have time to wait for test results,” says Dr John McCauley, the director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute in London.One option might be to start people on oseltamivir if there is any suspicion they have flu, McCauley says, and then stop the treatment if a flu test comes back negative. Another concern is that some patients may have flu and Covid at once, which nearly doubles the risk of dying compared with Covid infection alone.How should we prepare?Surveillance of influenza cases around the world, in the southern hemisphere, the Middle East and tropical regions, should provide early warning of the flu season to come, but most important is to ensure that people who are vulnerable to influenza and Covid – and there is considerable overlap – are well-protected by vaccines. All adults should have the opportunity to receive two shots of Covid vaccine before the flu season starts and the NHS aims to repeat last year’s extended flu vaccination programme, making flu shots available to everyone aged 50 and over, in addition to children and the usual at-risk groups.Flu vaccines are not as effective as Covid vaccines – 50% effectiveness is considered good – but they still make a huge difference. “With flu, you are on a knife-edge. It doesn’t take a lot to have a bad flu season,” says McCauley. “There is always uncertainty and vaccination is the insurance policy. You can’t afford not to be prepared for a flu epidemic. It doesn’t matter if it doesn’t happen: vaccines are cheap.”Can Covid and flu jabs be given together?Going into the winter, some people may need Covid booster jabs to top up their immunity, particularly those who had their first vaccine in December or January. This will be easier for the NHS to deliver if Covid boosters are given at the same time as flu shots. Studies are under way to look at the feasibility of giving both together and are expected to have answers later in the year.“It’s a major challenge to get flu vaccines into people, but it is a challenge to which the NHS regularly rises,” says Openshaw. “But trying to administer separate vaccines for Covid and an intensified flu vaccination campaign is a huge challenge if they aren’t to be given simultaneously.”Explore more on these topicsFluHealthCoronavirusInfectious diseasesVaccines and immunisationexplainersShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Read time: 2 minutes A bout with flu virus can be hard, but when Streptococcus pneumonia enters the mix, it can turn deadly.Now researchers have found a further reason for the severity of this dual infection by identifying a new virulence mechanism for a surface protein on the pneumonia-causing bacteria S. pneumoniae. This insight comes more than three decades after discovery of that surface protein, called pneumococcal surface protein A, or PspA.This new mechanism had been missed in the past because it facilitates bacterial adherence only to dead or dying lung epithelial cells, not to living cells. Heretofore, researchers typically used healthy lung cell monolayers to search for bacterial adhesins that aid infection. Virus killing of lung cells during flu was found to set the stage for S. pneumonia attachment to the airway, thereby worsening disease and pneumonia.The research, published in the journal Cell Reports, was led by Carlos Orihuela, Ph.D., and David Briles, Ph.D., professor and professor emeritus in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Department of Microbiology. Orihuela and Briles say their findings provide further explanation for how an infection by influenza A flu virus -- followed by S. pneumoniae superinfection -- causes severe pneumonia and a high death rate. The mechanism also points to possible improvements for disease treatment and vaccination.A historical example of the deadly synergy of flu infection followed by S. pneumoniae superinfection is found in banked lung samples from the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic that killed 40 million to 50 million people -- the vast majority of these samples showed co-infection or secondary infection with S. pneumonia.The UAB research on PspA began with some head-scratching results from experimental lung infections of mice with influenza A, followed by either wild-type S. pneumonia that has the intact PspA gene, or a mutant S. pneumoniae that lacks PspA. Lung homogenates from mice infected with the wild-type had much higher numbers of S. pneumonia bacteria than lungs infected with the mutant. However, when researchers washed the interiors of the lungs and collected that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, they counted similar numbers of the wild-type S. pneumonia and the mutant."This unexpected result was interpreted to mean that wild-type S. pneumoniae were more resistant to dislodgement than S. pneumonia with a pspA gene deletion, and it served as rationale for further experimentation," Orihuela said.From this clue, the researchers were able to show that PspA functions as an adhesin to dying host cells, in addition to its several other previously established virulence mechanisms. The researchers also detailed the molecular mechanism of this bacterial adherence.Both influenza A infection and release of the S. pneumoniae toxin pneumolysin cause death of lung epithelial cells. As they are dying, cells' phosphatidylserine residues get flipped to the outer cell membrane, where they bind the host enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or GAPDH. In turn, the S. pneumoniae PspA on the surface of the bacteria binds to the GAPDH. PspA-GAPDH-mediated binding to lung cells increased S. pneumoniae localization in the lower airway, and this was enhanced by pneumolysin exposure or co-infection with influenza A virus.Tests with fragments of the PspA protein showed that a 52-amino acid portion of the protein -- from amino acid 230 to 281 -- was required for GAPDH binding. Instilling one of those binding fragments into the lungs of influenza-infected mice reduced the disease severity of S. pneumoniae superinfection, presumably through binding competition."Our findings support the targeting of regions of PspA for therapeutic and vaccine development against influenza A/Streptococcus pneumoniae superinfections," Orihuela said. "Importantly, and despite more than 30 years since its discovery, PspA was not previously shown to function as an adhesin. Thus, our finding of PspA's role in adherence substantially advances our knowledge on the interactions of S. pneumoniae with its host."Reference: Park S-S, Gonzalez-Juarbe N, Riegler AN, et al. Streptococcus pneumoniae binds to host GAPDH on dying lung epithelial cells worsening secondary infection following influenza.

Part of the LabX Media GroupFact check: California lawmakers could decide on vaccine exemptionSkip to main content HomeU.S.SportsEntertainmentLifeMoneyTechTravelOpinionFor SubscribersWeatherInvestigationsCrosswordsHumankindNewslettersMediaFor YouContributor Content Fact check: California doesn't have personal belief exemption for COVID-19 vaccination in schoolsDaniel Funke | USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption White House turns focus to getting under 30 vaccinatedThe Biden Administration is turning its vaccination focus on the under 30 population, as the country isn't expected to meet the president's July 4th deadline in getting 70% of the population vaccinated with at least one shot. (June 22)APThe claim: California has a personal belief exemption for new vaccine requirements in schoolsAs the United States lags behind the Biden administration's goal to get 70% of Americans at least partially vaccinated by July 4, anti-vaccine advocates on social media are sharing tactics for getting around vaccination requirements.Denise Aguilar is an outspoken critic of vaccines and the founder of a woman-oriented survivalist group called Mamalitia. In a June 21 Instagram post, she said her home state of California has a loophole for parents who want to avoid getting their children vaccinated against the coronavirus, influenza and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines."California has a personal belief exemption to any NEW vaccine added to the schedule after June 2015 for public & private daycare, preschool & k-12," says text in the image, which has more than 6,400 likes.As evidence, the post cites "CA SB277 Sec. 3. Section 120338." The law, which then-Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed in June 2015, eliminated personal belief exemptions that allowed parents to opt out of vaccinating their children.But the post overreaches on the impact of this law. Fact check: COVID-19 vaccines provide safer, more consistent immunity than infectionFor one, coronavirus, influenza and HPV vaccines are not required in California public and private schools, so no personal belief exemption is needed to avoid them.And the vaccine waiver referenced here would only apply if the state health department added the requirement — something that's never happened before. Vaccine law experts say the California Legislature, not the health department, has always decided which vaccines to require in schools, meaning lawmakers would decide whether to allow personal belief exemptions for future vaccine requirements.No personal belief exemptionsCalifornia is one of only a handful of states that offers no non-medical exemptions for existing school vaccination requirements. That policy traces back to the law cited in Aguilar's Instagram post.In 2015, lawmakers got rid of personal belief exemptions for a list of 10 vaccinations required for children in both public and private schools. Prior to that, parents could get out of vaccinating their children by filling out a form, signed by a health care provider, saying vaccines violated their personal beliefs. Under the new law, parents could still provide a valid medical exemption or choose to home-school their children.Included on the list of mandatory vaccines are shots for diseases like diphtheria, hepatitis B and tetanus. The coronavirus, influenza and HPV vaccines are not currently required for school children in California.Aguilar and Tara Thornton, co-founders of the anti-vaccine advocacy group Freedom Angels, told USA TODAY in an email that, if the state were to require those vaccines, a personal belief exemption would apply. "The personal belief exemption is available for any vaccine added to the schedule after 2015 beyond the 10 listed in the bill text," they wrote.As evidence, Aguila and Thornton cited the following passage of the 2015 bill: "This bill would eliminate the exemption from existing specified immunization requirements based upon personal beliefs, but would allow exemption from future immunization requirements deemed appropriate by the State Department of Public Health for either medical reasons or personal beliefs."That provision made it into state law. But vaccine law experts say the clause, which amended the state's existing Health and Safety Code, doesn't mean what anti-vaccine advocates say it means."Misinformation sources took this section, and read it to say 'every new vaccine needs a personal belief exemption (PBE).' But that only applies if the Department of Health added the vaccine, which never happened," Dorit Reiss, a law professor at the University of California-San Francisco, told USA TODAY in an email.Fact check: COVID-19 vaccines aren't magneticThe existing vaccine requirements for school children in California were passed by the state Legislature — not the health department. Reiss said that, if the state were to require vaccination against COVID-19 or other diseases, it would probably go through a similar process. Lawmakers could then decide whether they wanted to include a personal belief exemption, but that's not as certain as Aguilar's post makes it sound.USA TODAY reached out to the California Department of Public Health for comment, but it did not provide one on the record.Our rating: Partly falseThe claim that California has a personal belief exemption for new vaccine requirements in schools is PARTLY FALSE, based on our research. State law does reference this, but vaccine law experts say the waiver only is required if the state health department adds the vaccination requirements itself, which the department has never done. If California were to require a new vaccines in schools for COVID-19 or anything else, it would likely go through the Legislature, which woulddecide whether to include a personal belief exemption.Our fact-check sources:Denise Aguilar, June 21, InstagramUSA TODAY, June 22, Biden administration says it won't make 70% COVID-19 vaccine goal.

Allrecipes' editorial guidelines Updated on June 21, 2021 Close These top-rated recipes comfort completely while also boosting your immune system. They'll keep you on your feet this cold and flu season. Rosemary Chicken Noodle Soup | Photo by Andrew T. What should you eat to keep common colds and the seasonal flu away? Recently, CNN asked that question of Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist, an internist at Emory University. Dr. Bergquist recommended "a diet rich in high-fiber foods, vitamins A and C) and antioxidants." Also, stay hydrated. When the aching and fever kick in, that's your signal to up your intake of fluids -- at least 8 ounces per hour, according to experts. As Kate Murphy smartly summarizes in The New York Times: "Drinking fluids will diminish your headache and bolster your immune response because your [immunologic] soldiers are conveyed via bodily fluids," which need to be replenished. Replenishing fluids is another reason why soup is such a smart choice when the the flu gets you in its clutches. And what should you avoid? "High-fat foods," said Dr. Bergquist, "especially those with saturated fat, because they may skew the body's balance of good and bad bacteria." These healthy comfort food recipes fit the Dr.'s prescription. Enjoy them any time -- whether you're under the weather or above the fray and hoping to stay that way. 1. Slow Cooker Chicken Mole Chipotle chile peppers in adobo sauce, peanut butter, garlic, and crushed tomatoes get things off to a healthy start.

Experts Caution People Against Swine Flu As Cases Of H1NI Rise Written by Arushi Bidhuri |Updated : June 23, 2021 10:35 PM IST In the midst of the continuing Covid-19 outbreak in Mumbai, cases of influenza H1N1 or swine flu is being reported in the city yet again. Last year, the city witnessed the same problem as swine flu cases rose amidst the pandemic. According to experts, swine flu and Covid-19 have similar disease presentation, experts have advised that doctors check for swine flu if patients don't respond to Covid-19 treatment. A media report suggested that seven to eight cases of H1N1 flu have been reported in the past month. Last year, Mumbai saw 44 instances of H1N1, while this year the city saw 451 cases and five deaths due to the virus. India Today reported that an expert on infectious disease, Dr Vasant Nagvekar said he has seen three cases of swine flu and two cases of H3N2, also a subtype of influenza A this year. What Is H1N1 Flu?H1N1 is one of the several strains of swine flu. It initially spread after coming in contact with pigs but that soon changed when a new virus emerged that spread among individuals who had not come in contact with pigs.

This virus is a hybrid of pig, bird, and human viruses that causes sickness in people. H1N1 was responsible for the respiratory virus known as swine flu in humans during the 2009-10 flu season. Because it was spreading rapidly around the world in 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it a pandemic. Since then, it has been infecting people around the world, but not as many. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the signs of the disease to safeguard yourself from getting it. Symptoms of the disease include: CoughChillsFeverSore throatBody achesHeadacheFatigueRunny or stuffy noseDiarrhoeaNausea and vomitingSince most of the symptoms of swine flu are similar to Covid-19, people often get confused, which is why here are some differences to help you understand it better. Difference Between Covid-19 And Swine FluIt is easy to get confused with these two diseases since both, Covid-19 and swine flu viruses are respiratory diseases, hence the right diagnosis is important. Both the diseases can transmit by contact, droplets and fomites. You may like to read One of the major differences between the diseases is that H1N1 has a shorter incubation period as compared to Covid-19. Mortality for Covid appears higher, whereas data on H1N1 is not well-documented in India. However, vaccines are available to treat the conditions that will help people combat the diseases. So, go out there and get vaccinated as that is your best bet against the pandemic right now. TRENDING NOW As for the Covid tally, the city recorded 10,066 new Covid cases and 163 deaths in the last 24 hours. During the same time period, the state reported 11,032 recoveries.

Restrictions will not be as heavy and, as a result, there will be a flu epidemic,” said Graham Medley, a professor at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who chairs the Sage sub-group on pandemic modelling.“And because of the fact we didn’t have one last winter, that might be a bit larger, or a lot larger, and I think that’s something that focus will turn to as much as Covid in the future.”The ComFluCov study is looking at what side-effects people get when they are given a recommended flu vaccine alongside either the Oxford/AstraZeneca or the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, as well as the immune responses when the two shots are co-administered.Finn said early results on the side-effects when two jabs are given together had been shared with the JCVI. However, the official results are expected by August or September, said the study’s chief investigator, Dr Rajeka Lazarus, a consultant in infectious diseases and microbiology at University hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS foundation trust.For now, the study is looking at the impact of giving the second Covid dose alongside a flu vaccine, but further research may be needed if a subsequent “booster” Covid shot is required, she said.Finn said there was a “reasonably strong possibility” that both the Covid and flu jabs could be administered in one appointment either this autumn, or as part of a programme to administer Covid booster shots early next year, or even both.The big question facing researchers on the ComFluCov study is whether the side-effects produced by giving both jabs together are worse than when they are given on their own. Another key question is whether the immunity provided by the two jabs changes when they are administered at the same time.One concern is that the immune system could respond to one vaccine more than the other, said Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “So you might get a very good response to the Covid vaccine, let’s say, but not a very good one to the flu [jab] – or the other way around. And so that could be a problem.” Alternatively, getting the jabs at the same time might boost the immune response to both, he added.Novavax – a Covid vaccine developer that recently published successful late-stage data on its jab – examined in a study that has yet to be peer reviewed whether its vaccine could be given in tandem with an influenza vaccine. Data showed that co-administering the jabs resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune response, while a minor reduction in antibody responses, from 89.8% to 87.5%, was found for the Covid vaccine.Novavax and Moderna are also in the early stages of developing a combined Covid and flu vaccine.Explore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationCoronavirusNHSHealthFluInfectious diseasesMedical researchnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
