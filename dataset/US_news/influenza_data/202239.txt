During egg- or cell culture-propagation, the vaccine viruses become too old to confer the highest match with the latest strains, impacting vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, an alternative strategy like mRNA-based vaccine using the most recent strains should be considered. We analyzed influenza A subtype H3N2 strains circulating in NH during the last 10 years (2009–2020). Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple clades of influenza strains circulating every season, which had substantial mismatches with WHO-recommended vaccine strains. The clustering pattern suggests that influenza A subtype H3N2 strains are not fixed to the specific geographical region but circulate globally in the same season. By analyzing 39 seasons from eight NH countries with the highest vaccine coverage, we also provide evidence that the influenza A, subtype H3N2 strains from South and Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh, had the highest genetic proximity to the NH strains. Furthermore, insilico analysis showed minimal effect on the Bangladeshi HA protein structure, indicating the stability of Bangladeshi strains. Therefore, we propose that Bangladeshi influenza strains represent genetic makeup that may better fit and serve as the most suitable candidate vaccine viruses for the forthcoming NH season.

However, the demand for seasonal influenza vaccines has been increasing (i.e. the USA estimated 200 million doses for 2021–2022 season), considering the health and economic impact of influenza virus with an estimated annual 5–10% infection in adults2 and 20–30% in children3. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that these infections result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths globally4. However, the influenza A virus does cause not only seasonal endemic infections in humans, but also unpredictable periodic pandemics.A recent meta-analysis calculated the influenza attack rate among unvaccinated individuals, and found that 22.5% of child < 18 years old and 10.7% of adults were influenza positive5. Due to influenza, the estimated average annual total economic burden was $11.1 billion in the United Stats6. To minimized this health and economic burden, vaccination remains the best strategy for preventing the spread of seasonal influenza. Due to rapid viral evolution, the influenza vaccine formulation requires updates each flu season; hence, the term “seasonal vaccine”7.Antigenic evolution of human influenza A viruses facilitate the virus to escape pre-existing immunity through abrupt drift with structural alterations in antigenic epitopes. The segmented genome and zoonotic nature allow the exchange or reassortment of RNA segments between viruses when a host is co-infected with different influenza strains, known as antigenic shift. This may generate novel strains with enhanced pathogenicity and facilitate crossing species barriers, thereby contributing to influenza pandemics at unpredictable intervals8. Thus, variants of circulating or newly emerging influenza A viruses continue to trigger global health threats annually for both humans and animals.Circulating influenza A virus is classified based on the genotype of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins (18 HA and 11 NA)9. Among these subtypes, H1N1 pdm09 virus, a descendant of the seasonal H1N1 influenza which had circulated before 2009, is now predominant in most countries, although the proportion of H3N2 virus had increased over time10. Therefore, WHO and the National Influenza Centers conduct influenza virologic surveillance to monitor the spread of viruses and their continuous evolution. Each year considering previous surveillance data, an expert panel of WHO recommends the most appropriate vaccine for the next season in February and September for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (SH), respectively. Three types of seasonal influenza vaccines are currently licensed for human use; however, most influenza vaccines are distributed as inactivated vaccines (89.6% of global production) which contain antigen from two influenza A strains (subtype H1N1 and H3N2), and including influenza B strain(s). Global production of two other vaccines, live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) was similar in 2019, 5.0% and 5.4% respectively1. But, over time, antigenic changes of circulating strains affects receptor preference, virulence, and vaccine effectiveness (VE)11,12. Therefore, VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection is rarely higher than 60% and may sometimes be 30% or less, with protection that may wane from one season to the next or within a season13,14,15,16,17,18.Furthermore, the timing and duration of the influenza season vary by country and by year. Previous studies showed that new antigenic variants of influenza A subtype H3N2 appear every 3–5 years, whereas new antigenic variants of influenza A subtypr H1N1 viruses appear less frequently19. However, phylogenetic analyses provided evidence against the local persistence of influenza A subtype H3N2 viruses between epidemics20 where South and Southeast Asia (SSEA) act as the global source of the viruses21,22,23,24,25, that might spread globally19. In SSEA region, influenza A subtype H3N2 viruses become locally extinct between epidemics, but variation in local climates enables viruses to circulate continuously from one epidemic to another19,21. Therefore, we explored the evolutionary footprint of influenza A subtype H3N2 strains in Bangladesh to assess their suitability as potential vaccine candidates (referred as p-vac throughout the text).International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in collaboration with the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), the national influenza center, has been conducting hospital-based influenza surveillance (HBIS) since 2007 across the country26. Taking advantage of the existing surveillances and available genomic sequence data in EpiFlu database in GISAID.ORG, this study describes (i) the global circulating pattern of influenza A subtype H3N2 strains in contrast to the vaccine strain through phylogenetic analysis; (ii) the evolutionary pattern of the influenza A subtype H3N2 virus circulating in Bangladesh during the last decade, and finally, (iii) genetic proximity of p-vac with circulating strains of high vaccine coverage countries in the northern hemisphere (NH).ResultsPhylogenetic analysis of influenza H3N2 strainsA phylogenetic tree was constructed to observe the possible circulation pattern of influenza A subtype H3N2 over time, using HA genes of vaccine strains (recommended for the NH) and globally circulating strains (Fig. 1). Different branch colours indicate the geographical origin of the strains; i.e. red for Bangladesh and pink for South-East-Asia (SEA). The colour ribbon on the right side shows the timeline of each strain. Thus, the same colour in different positions of the ribbon specifies more than one phylogenetically distinct influenza strains circulating every season. The green arrows indicate the vaccine strains (WHO recommended) that are distantly related to the circulating strains of the respective seasons, with few exceptions. The same cluster with different branch colour suggests that influenza A subtype H3N2 strains are not fixed to the specific geographical region but circulate globally in the same season.Figure 1The time-scaled phylogenetic tree of HA gene from globally circulating influenza A subtype H3N2 strains, including WHO-recommended vaccine strains (indicated by green arrow). Different branch colours indicated strains location. The right colour ribbon indicates the year of sample collection.Full size imageFor understanding the relationship between the Bangladeshi dominant strains, p-vac and WHO recommended vaccines, we have constructed another phylogenetic tree using a generalized time-reversible (GTR) substitution model (Supplementary Appendix B, Fig. B1). This tree also produced similar results to MCMC tree (Fig. 1), where the WHO-recommended vaccine placed in a different clade than the most dominant Bangladeshi strains (Table 1).Table 1 The clade of WHO recommended H3N2 vaccine strains and concurrent most dominant strains detected in Bangladesh.Full size tableGenetic proximity of p-vac with circulating strainsThe genetic distance (p-distance) of WHO-recommended vaccine and p-vac from SSEA with NH strains (South Korea, UK, USA, Ireland, The Netherlands, Japan, Sweden and Russia) circulating during 2015–2020, are presented in Fig. 2. The box-plot analysis, which includes 39 seasons, shows that the p-vac were more closely related to NH strains circulating in the subsequent seasons (31/39, 79.5%) compared to vaccine strains (20.5%). The box-plot for Korea indicates the average p-distances of vaccine strain in red which was much higher than the p-vac in other colours; even sometimes higher than the control strain from SH in grey. A similar conclusion can be made for other countries.Figure 2Genetic proximity of selected potential vaccine (p-vac) and WHO-recommended vaccine strain with circulating strains from consecutive seasons. Mean genetic distance (p-distance) of vaccine and p-vac strains in each season are shown separately as Box-plot graph. The number of analyzed sequences from a season were denoted with (n).Full size imageSince the vaccine effectiveness is largely affected by epitope sites, we further compared epitope sites of vaccine strains and p-vac with globally circulating strains during 2015–2020 from Dataset-1. In most of the epitope sites, the p-vac and NH strains were closer than the vaccine strains indicated by green arrows (Fig. 3). In epitope-D, one amino acid site (K176) in 2015–2016, two (K176 and P210) during 2016–2018, three (K176, P210 and D241) in 2018–2019 and four (K176, G202, D206 and S235) in 2019–2020 were identified. In other epitopes, A154, N160 in 2015–2016; N187 in 2016–2017; E78 in 2018–2019; and E78, N137, N160 and N187 in 2019–2020, also showed higher proximity of NH strains with p-vac than vaccine except one in 2017–2018 season indicated by purple arrow (Fig. 3).Figure 3Amino acid changes in epitope site of global hemagglutinin protein (HA) sequences. The red bar indicates the percent of changes compared with the WHO-recommended vaccine, while others indicate p-vac. The green down-arrow indicates the site where p-vac (any of the four) showed higher proximity with global strains than the vaccine. The purple up-arrow indicates the site where the vaccine showed higher proximity than all p-vac.Full size imageThe evolutionary trend of Bangladeshi Inf/H3N2 strainsWe analyzed all eight gene segments of influenza A subtype H3N2 circulating in Bangladesh (n = 531) from 2009 to 2020 to observe the mutation pattern (Table 2). The highest mutation rate was found in NS (4.54 × 10–3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year), and the lowest rate in PA (2.37 × 10–3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year). The two major glycoproteins, HA and NA, showed high mutation rates as expected, 4.33 × 10–3 and 4.06 × 10–3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year, respectively. For all gene segments, the divergence ratio at non-synonymous and synonymous sites across the protein sequence was negatively selected (dN/dS < 1). However, most of the amino acids were conserved at a specific position in a protein sequence; therefore, selection pressure for each site was calculated using four different models (Table 1). The highest diversifying eight positive selection sites were identified in HA followed by six in NA, three in NS1 and PB2, two in PA, and one in MP and PB1. Among the eight diversifying HA sites, four belonged to one from each epitope site of A, B, D and E; at amino acid positions 147, 160, 214 and 69, respectively (Fig. 4A).Table 2 Evolutionary rate of Bangladeshi H3N2 strains over a decade (Jan 2009–Dec 2020).Full size tableFigure 4(A) 3D structure of hemagglutinin protein (HA) indicating diversifying epitope sites for Bangladeshi strain; (B) changes in host receptor binding affinity for alterations in the amino acid, at the positions of diversifying epitope sites.Full size imageInsilico analysis of highly diversifying epitope site3-D models for all possible amino acid substitutions at positions 69, 147, 160, and 214 were prepared based on the highest sequence identity with templet (98 to 99), sequence similarity (0.62), coverage (0.88), and lowest resolution value (1.90 Å) determined by the X-ray diffraction method. The Ramachandran plot for all models indicates that more than 95% of the residues were in the favoured regions and only < 0.4% in the outlier region. Based on the Verify 3D software, more than 88% of the residues have an average 3D-1D score of ≥ 0.2. For all protein models, ERRAT’s overall quality factor ranges from 96 to 98. According to the ProSA-web result, all protein models were of appropriate quality and consistency with Z-scores ranging from − 8.68 to − 9.6.To see if alterations in the amino acid, at the positions of 147, 160, 214, and 69 from A, B, D, and E epitope respectively have influenced the host receptor binding, computationally all of 80 3D prepared proteins were docked on N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminic acid-(2-6)-beta-d-galactopyranose (Fig. 4B). In position 147, substitution with Lysine showed reduced affinity while others had no significant change for epitope A. Similarly, in position 160, Glycine and Methionine; in position 214, Alanine, Cysteine and Glutamine; and in position 69, Tyrosine and Arginine showed reduced affinity; while other substitutions showed no significant changes for B, D, and E epitope respectively (Fig. 4B).DiscussionOur study revealed the global circulating pattern of influenza A subtype H3N2 strains over time through phylogenetic analysis, where two or more distinct influenza strains circulate simultaneously in every season were identified. Additionally, vaccine strains were misplaced from the main branch of circulating strains of the respective seasons. Therefore, we considered the latest influenza A subtype H3N2 strains from South and South-East Asian (SSEA) regions as potential vaccine candidates (p-vac). The comparative genetic proximity and amino acid analysis of the HA protein epitope showed that p-vac from SSEA were closely related to the NH strains than the vaccine.Bangladesh has been providing genomic data through existing influenza surveillance, and here, we analyzed the evolutionary pattern of Bangladeshi strains from the last decade. A major rate difference between those segments expressed on the surface of the virus (high rates) and those that only have internal functions (low rates) was observed. However, a modest mutation rate of HA gene was observed in Bangladesh influenza A subtype H3N2 (Supplemenatry Appendix Table A2). But, this rate was higher than influenza A subtype H1N1 and influenza B in humans27,28. Due to a higher mutation rate, subtype H3N2 infected individuals might remain immunologically naïve for recurrent subtype H3N2 infections19. However, our insilico analysis showed no major affinity changes for amino acid substitution in the highly diversifying position of epitope sites of Bangladeshi strains, except few exceptions (Fig. 4). Therefore, selecting Bangladeshi strains as the global vaccine is very promising.The degree of similarity between vaccines and circulating strains are affected by the heterogeneity of the influenza A subtype H3N2 virus, resulting in a modest VE each season29. In this study, the phylogenetic analysis showed a similar result in the heterogeneity of global influenza A subtype H3N2 and vaccine strains. For instance, the vaccine of the 2019–2020 season made a close cluster with north American 2018 strains while globally circulated 2019–2020 strains were in a distinctive cluster, which might result in low (39%) VE in the USA for season 2019–202030. Such disparity between circulating viruses and the vaccine strain could have resulted in low immunity of populations, leading to reduced VE previously reported globally31,32,33,34. On the other hand, the overall VE was estimated below 40%, even after genetic proximity with circulating strains34,35,36, due to the co-circulation of different strains and/or sudden decline of a dominant strain37. Furthermore, the H3N2 vaccines undergo mutation during passage in eggs in 2012–2013, 2013–2014, 2014–2015, 2015–2016, 2017–2018, and 2018–2019 seasons37,38. The fast and unpredicted evolution is the main reason for these scenarios.However, increased surveillance revealed that the SSEA region plays an important role in influenza virus evolution and seeding epidemics worldwide19. While the influenza season starts later in this region than other NH countries19; therefore, the WHO failed to consider the latest strains during vaccine recommendation in February for the upcoming season. Here, we tried to find potential vaccine (p-vac) strains with the highest genetic proximity to circulating strains of subsequent flu season from the latest SSEA strains. Every season constant higher genetic proximity with circulating strains was observed for p-vac. Therefore, the upcoming NH’s seasonal influenza vaccine should be recommended after considering the most recent strain from SSEA.The study had several limitations. First, selecting the early appeared strains region as p-vac, could be a selesction bias due to the fact that the selected p-vac starin would no longer the dominant starins in that season. Second, the genetic distance between WHO-recommended strains and p-vac from SSEA was missing during 2009–2015 because of limited data on consecutive seasons available in GISAID database. Finally, we only focused on influenza A subtype H3N2 strain and NH region. Whether this method is applicable for influenza A subtype H1N1 strain and SH region, needs further investigation to illustrate the comprehensive global scenario.Our study concluded that influenza strains from SSEA are closer to the time of intended vaccine use and had the highest genetic proximity to strains of the next season. By selecting these strains as vaccine candidates will help reducing the window of opportunity for the emergence of new antigenic variants in the human population. Although the vaccine candidates identified by this approach showed better genetic proximity to circulating strains of subsequent flu season, further study including global strains with immunological assay data is required to identify the best vaccine candidates. A highly sensitive pseudovirus-based assay for neutralization antibodies against the influenza virus could be a potential tool for in-vitro validation and evaluation of p-vac39,40,41. In addition, considering the most recent strain will delay the production of egg-based influenza vaccines, which can be overcome by using advanced mRNA based technology42 as an alternative for future influenza vaccines. Our findings provide new insight into the influenza vaccine selection and production process for the policymaker.MethodsTime-scaled phylogenies of globally circulating strainsNeutralizing antibodies or immunity are generated against HA protein43. Therefore, only HA gene was considered for further analysis and Dataset-1 was prepared, including 596 global HA sequences. In brief, from 2009 to 2020 at least 5 strains were randomly selected for each year from Bangladesh, East Asia (China/Korea/Japan), Southeast Asia (Indonesia/Malaysia/Philippines/Singapore/Thailand/Vietnam), Central Asia (India/Kazakhstan/Uzbekistan), Europian Union (Germany/Greece/Spain/Sweden), United Kingdom, North America (Canada/USA), Oceania (Australia/New Zealand), and Southern Hemisphere (Namibia/ Madagascar/South Africa/Argentina/Brazil/Chile/Peru) (Supplementary Appendix D: Dataset-1). All the influenza A subtype H3N2 vaccine strains recommended for the 2008–2009 to 2019–2020 seasons in the NH were also included in this dataset.Bayesian inference was implemented through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework in BEAST v2.6.344 to prepare the evolutionary tree. We employed GTR for each dataset and a coalescent Bayesian skyline tree prior and strict molecular clock model. MCMC chains were run for 5 million steps, and TreeAnnotator program v2.6.0 was used to summarise the obtaining file as a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree. Finally, the tree with the maximum product of posterior probabilities after a 10% burn-in was visualized using FigTree v1.4.4.Selection and comparison of potential vaccine (p-vac) with country wise dataCountries between equator and tropic of cancer from the world map were selected for potential vaccine (p-vac) strain selection as influenza A subtype H3N2 spread globally from SSEA each year19. Only four countries (Bangladesh, India, Thailand, and Singapore) had sequences of the last five consecutive seasons (2015–2020) from this region. Australia from the SH was also included as an outgroup for identifying p-vac. The first identified sequence (based on collection date in the database) was selected as p-vac from each season, but no later than the 2nd of June (Supplementary Appendix D: Dataset-2). All selected p-vac were compared with sequence data from the top five influenza vaccination countries in the NH; Korea, UK, USA, Ireland, Netherlands, Japan, and Sweden45. Although vaccine coverage data was unavailable for Russia, sequences data were included as Russia covered a large geographical region. A separate dataset (Supplementary Appendix D: Dataset-3) having all sequences from 2015–2016 to 2019–2020 seasons of each country was prepared. The average genetic distance (p-distance) with all five p-vac and WHO recommended vaccine strains of each concurrent season was calculated using MEGA X (Version 10.0.5)46.Evolutionary rate and selection pressure measurement for Bangladeshi strainAll gene segments of influenza A subtype H3N2 strains (n = 531) from 2009 to 2020 were retrieved (Supplementary Appendix D: Dataset-4) from the EpiFlu database of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) website (www.gisaid.org) for analysis of evolutionary dynamics. The MUSCLE programme47 was used for multiple sequence alignment. To calculate the evolutionary rate (nucleotide substitutions/site/year), an uncorrelated relaxed clock log-normal molecular clock model with coalescent Bayesian skyline prior was used through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework in BEAST (v2.6.3)44. MCMC chains were run for 100 million steps, sampling every 10,000 steps from the posterior distribution to ensure adequate mixing of model parameters. The best-fit nucleotide substitution model was identified according to the Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and performance-based decision theory method with 11 (88 candidate models) substitution schemes in jModelTest v2.1.1048. GTR model was used for each gene, and the evolutionary rate was evaluated using Tracer v1.7.1. Finally, all the genes were subjected to selection pressures measurement using the Datamonkey server49 by calculating the ratio of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitutions per site (dN/dS).Insilico epitope analysis of HA proteinFor epitope and other Insilico analysis of HA protein from NCBI GenBank references strain A/New York/392/2004 subtype H3N2 (accession# YP_308839) was used as a representative sequence for exploring the changes of binding affinity to its human receptor. Each highly diversifying positive selection site (amino acid positions 147, 160, 214, and 69) were manually substituted with corresponding amino acid and prepared a dataset of 80 target sequences for homology modelling using the SWISS-MODEL server50. The SWISS-MODEL template library (SMTL version 2022-01-05, PDB release 2021-12-31) was explored to search for the best templates for the target sequences. The SWISS PDB viewer optimized the geometry by energy reduction on the created 3D models. The quality of the projected 3D models was examined using Duke University’s Molprobity web server51, Verify 3D, and ERRAT. For the investigation of structural flaws, plotting of residue scores, and generating Z scores, ProSA52 was used. For ligand preparation and molecular docking to determine Binding Affinity, N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminic acid-(2-6)-beta-d-galactopyranose was extracted from the PDB:2WRE as a ligand molecule. Geometry optimization of ligand molecule was conducted using MMFF94 force field in Avogadro53. Molecular docking of individual 3D protein models with optimized ligand was performed by AutoDock wizard in PyRx (version 0.8) virtual screening tool54 to find out binding affinities. Their interactions were visualized and analyzed using Discovery Studio Visualizer v20.1.0.19295, Chimera 1.13rc, and Pymol (The EduPyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.7.4.5 Schrödinger, LLC).

For the birds: Battling the threat of avian influenza By Susan Kelley, Cornell Chronicle September 28, 2022 In mid-February, the owners of a backyard flock in Suffolk County, New York, noticed two guinea hens and three of their chickens were sick. Three days later, the birds were dead. Within five hours of getting a swab of the birds’ airways, Cornell’s Animal Health Diagnostic Center and the New York State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory determined it was New York state’s first case of a deadly strain of avian influenza – the same strain that has killed millions of domestic poultry and devastated wild birds in dozens of countries. Cornell researchers knew highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu, was coming. They had been tracking the disease’s spread in northeast Canada and then in the Carolinas for months. “We knew it was almost inevitable that we were going to get hit. So we put everything in place to prepare for it,” says anatomic pathologist Gavin Hitchener, director of Cornell’s Duck Research Laboratory on Long Island, just 15 miles from the backyard flock. “There was no shock moment for me. Fear? Yes. Because it was like, ‘It’s really in my backyard now.’ But we were prepared.” Credit: Noël Heaney/Cornell University Dr. Jarra Jagne, DVM ’90, associate professor of practice in the Department of Public and Ecosystem Health at the College of Veterinary Medicine, examines a submission in the Animal Health Diagnostic Center’s necropsy laboratory. Within hours of confirmation by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, and an announcement by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Veterinary Services, Hitchener started calling commercial poultry operators to advise them on enhancing their biosafety protocols. The idea is to keep the birds inside, where they won’t mix with the wild waterfowl that carry the disease; limit interaction with other farms; and prevent cross-contamination within the farm, Hitchener says. “We knew how to implement strategies to prepare, and prevent potential losses,” he says. Hitchener and others at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, part of the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM), have been helping to keep New York’s avian flu incidents remarkably low, with education, outreach and testing that help safeguard commercial producers and backyard flock owners from the devastating disease. Those measures have helped to minimize New York’s avian flu cases. As of April 6, the state has had just one outbreak in a small commercial flock and seven in backyard flocks, for a total of 9,500 birds affected. Credit: Cornell University; Pathways and silhouettes by Chloe Lam Wild birds cross New York state -- and sometimes spread avian influenza -- during the fall migration as they fly from Greenland to South America via the Atlantic flyway. So far, all of the state’s large commercial operations have remained unscathed, including the flock of more than 100,000 ducks that Marcus Henley oversees in the Hudson Valley. “The ability for poultry farmers to reach out and get answers to these questions is so important to us all. It’s a really vital resource to the state,” Henley says. “Cornell having that depth of understanding of how the virus is spread – it’s just critical.” What is bird flu and why can it be so devastating? New York is currently in what Hitchener calls an avian influenza “lull.” But he and other Cornell researchers and staff are taking measures now during the fall migration, when migrating birds will flood the Atlantic flyway, from Greenland to South America, crossing New York state along the way. When migrating birds land near bodies of water, their feces and other secretions spread the virus to commercial and backyard flocks and wild birds – say, when a bird drinks water contaminated with the virus. “Because backyard flocks are usually outside, free-range, they’re mixing and mingling with migratory birds. They may pick the virus up from the feces of wild birds in their environment,” says veterinarian Jarra Jagne, DVM ’90, head of the Animal Health Diagnostic Center’s Avian Health Program. There are 144 types of avian influenza. Some cause just mild respiratory infection. But the current strain, H5N1, is highly pathogenic and causes extreme mortality, says Jagne, who is also an associate professor of practice in the Department of Public and Ecosystem Health at CVM. When the virus takes hold, it replicates rapidly in the respiratory, neurologic, digestive and reproductive organs. “It is systemic – throughout the whole body. This virus just enters and destroys the tissues,” Jagne says. “And so within 24 to 48 hours after seeing the first sick or dead birds, you will see very high mortality.” Waterfowl, like geese and gulls, are the natural reservoirs of all avian influenza. Other wild birds can be infected, such as bald eagles, owls, and other birds of prey, says Krysten Schuler, director of the Cornell Wildlife Health Laboratory, which is part of the Animal Health Diagnostic Center. “A lot of birds of prey – eagles and vultures – were quite affected, because they scavenge dead birds,” she says. “And we have seen the virus too in some mammals. We have several cases of infected and dying young foxes.” Credit: Sreang Veng Hok/Cornell University Ducklings nestle together at a farm in New York’s Hudson Valley. Because it is so devastating, “high path avian influenza is at the top of the list” of diseases the center tracks, says François Elvinger, executive director of the center, and professor of population medicine and diagnostic sciences and associate dean for diagnostic operations and government relations at CVM. The H5N1 strain has been circulating in various parts of the world since 1997, Jagne says. “But it had not affected New York state,” Jagne says. “It was just a matter of time.” The first case in New York In the first case in New York, the owner of the backyard flock in Suffolk County contacted the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, which sent a technician to take a swab from the birds. That swab was mailed overnight to the Animal Health Diagnostic Center. The center also tests wild bird samples sent by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and by the USDA’s Wildlife Services. And the center is one of 60 labs throughout the country in the National Animal Health Laboratory Network that tests sick and dead birds. “They send us samples from other states as well, from Maine, from the Carolinas, from Tennessee,” Elvinger says. The Suffolk County sample was one of about 1,500 submissions of all kinds of samples that the center tests every day, from a single blood sample to an entire cow or horse for necropsy. The center tested 280,000 submissions in the last fiscal year and has completed about 3,500 tests for the current bird flu outbreak, Elvinger says. While New York is not a big poultry producer, commercial farms do contribute significantly to the state’s economy, Jagne says. New York has nine large commercial poultry operations, and several medium-sized farms owned by Amish and Mennonite communities in the Finger Lakes region, for a total of 5.6 million egg-laying chickens. If avian influenza circulates through those flocks, “it’s going to be devastating, definitely, in terms of jobs and livelihoods,” Jagne says. “So anything that comes into our lab that has either neurological signs, or respiratory signs, coupled with high mortality, will be tested for highly pathogenic avian influenza.” The Cornell team was tracking reports that the strain was circulating in eastern Canada in January and February. “As soon as we saw highly pathogenic avian influenza in Canada, we started upping our game,” Hitchener says. That meant encouraging commercial producers and backyard flock owners to call if they saw any sickness or reduced egg production. And it meant advising them on how to enhance their biosecurity measures. For Henley, that meant making sure the birds he processes from local farmers were virus-free, restricting the public from visiting the farm, preventing employees from working in multiple buildings, and making sure every vehicle that enters or exits rolls through a concrete basin of disinfectant. “Suddenly we went from a routine maintenance of security, where we knew of no serious cases in the state, all the way to condition red,” Henley said. Credit: Sreang Veng Hok/Cornell University Poultry producer Marcus Henley, center, talks with co-workers on his farm in New York’s Hudson Valley. Within 16 days of the first case, Hitchener and the Cornell Duck Research Laboratory partnered with Cornell Cooperative Extension, the Long Island Farm Bureau and New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets to create a presentation on the science of the virus, the risks it poses, how it spreads, how to protect birds with biosecurity plans, and what happens when the virus is detected. Duck producers like Doug Corwin ’80 are especially at risk, because some have been breeding their birds for generations. Corwin, a fourth-generation duck farmer, operates Crescent Duck Farm in Aquebogue, New York, Long Island’s last remaining duck farm. It produces 1 million ducks per year, selling to fine-dining restaurants in New York City, Philadelphia and Boston. “If I had a strain of avian influenza here, I would lose my genetics. If I lose my genetics, I’m out of the poultry industry,” Corwin says. “Because my selling point is, I’ve made my genetics so much more different than my competition.” The guidance of the Cornell team has been invaluable, says Corwin, who is president of the International Duck Research Cooperative, which creates and produces USDA-licensed vaccines through the Duck Research Lab. “I owe a huge thanks for gratitude to Gavin and his outreach. He could speak as a Cornell University diagnostician, which carries an awful lot of weight,” Corwin says. “He’s helping to keep an awful lot of people in business right now.” The Cornell team will continue their efforts to keep the number of cases low as the fall migration ramps up, Jagne says. “We’ve been spreading the word: If you see any mortality, or unusual mortality, in your flock, give us a call.” Food & Agriculture Life Sciences & Veterinary Medicine Features NYS Impact Public Engagement Get Cornell news delivered right to your inbox.

Through innovative medicines and vaccines, we seek to protect every kind of heart: both healthy hearts and those that need more care. Flu-related heart attacks A balanced diet, exercise, and routine medical checks arenât the only important paths to a healthy heart. So is getting a flu vaccine each fall. Influenza infection (flu) can trigger a heart attack or stroke, even in otherwise healthy people.1Â In fact, the risk of a heart attack is 10 times greater within the week following a flu infection than at any other time.2,3 A flu vaccine can reduce that risk.4Â Influenza strikes every winter, so recommended flu shots are available before the season begins (and throughout the winter). Flu vaccines and COVID-19 Bogdana Coudsy, Global Head of Medical Affairs for Vaccines, explains the importance of flu shot timing: âThe peak of the annual flu epidemic has become more unpredictable since COVID-19 began circulating.5Â So the best plan is to get vaccinated early in the fall, at the start of countriesâ vaccination campaigns,â she said. Coudsy further advises, âYou donât need to choose between a flu shot and a COVID-19 booster. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple country health authorities have provided positive guidance on coadministration of a flu vaccine with a COVID-19 booster. At Sanofi, we have reported positive data on coadministration of our high dose flu vaccine and an mRNA COVID-19 boosterâ.6,7,8,9,10,11 High-risk hearts In addition to helping reduce the risks of flu-related heart attacks through vaccination, weâre also helping prevent recurrent heart attacks in cardiovascular patients at most risk. âUnfortunately, most people who have a second heart attack within 90 days of a first one will die within five years,â12Â says Luciana Giangrande, Global Cardiovascular Medical Head. Sanofi is one of the companies able to offer a complete range of solutions for high-risk cardiovascular patients and their physicians. These medicines enable them to reduce lipid levels, prevent heart attacks and strokes, and even save lives. Thatâs why weâre working with the global cardiology specialist community on a new kind of program. Weâre working with doctors to identify how at-risk patients may be missing out on life-saving solutions. We want to bridge those gaps with innovative health care tools and therapies.Luciana GiangrandeGlobal Cardiovascular Medical Head at SanofiBridging gaps in cardiovascular care Our Pulse Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) Pathway program13Â is helping bridge gaps in cardiovascular care. Because medical guidelines can change when new therapies or protocols become available, it can be challenging for doctors to keep up with the latest developments. ACS Pathway offers several solutions. New tools for doctors and hospitals Weâve rolled out a self-check tool that allows doctors to verify their current clinical practice scientifically against the latest treatment guidelines from medical societies. These checks help doctors understand and update their practice of interacting with at-risk ACS patients, from the acute phase to hospital discharge, through follow-ups and referrals. The program also supports the use of patient management protocols in hospitals to ensure the optimal care appropriate for each patientâs risk level. Weâre also developing new initiatives to improve standardization in treatment approaches to ACS patients and their doctors in different health care systems around the world.

Sept. 5, 2023 4 minute read Myth #1: The flu is just a bad cold.Truth #1: The flu can cause mild to severe illness and can even be deadly.The flu virus, also known as influenza, infects the nose, throat and sometimes the lungs. Flu symptoms include:FeverCoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle of body achesFatigue VomitingDiarrheaMost people who get the flu will only experience a mild case and can get relief with over-the-counter medications, but some people will develop more serious or life-threatening complications.Complications of the flu include:Sinus infectionsEar infectionsPneumoniaWorsening of existing chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes or heart failureThe most recent data available from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is from the 2019-2020 flu season. In that timeframe, 35 million people were estimated to have been infected with the flu. There were 16 million medical visits for the flu and 380,000 hospitalizations because of the flu. Twenty thousand people died from the flu. Some flu symptoms and COVID-19 symptoms are the same. Testing for the influenza virus and the COVID-19 virus is the best way to get a definitive diagnosis. Both are a simple swab of the back of the nose (towards the throat) that should be available through your doctor’s office. Depending on your diagnosis, treatment will be different. Myth #2: Healthy people don’t need to be vaccinated against the flu.Truth #2: Anyone can get the flu, even young, healthy people.While some people are at a higher risk than others of complications due to the flu, anyone can get the flu. The flu shot is recommended for everyone six months and older, with some rare exceptions. The CDC recommends that even pregnant women and people with certain chronic conditions get vaccinated against the flu.The flu vaccine protects you from getting sick with flu and reduces the severity of your symptoms if you do get sick. Getting vaccinated against the flu also protects those around you, especially people who are more likely to get severely ill or experience complications. Children under the age of 2 and adults over the age of 65 are the most vulnerable groups. Myth #3: I don’t need to get the flu shot every year.Truth #3: Immunity from the flu shot lasts a limited amount of time. Also, the virus that causes the flu changes each year.You should get the flu shot every year because immunity from your vaccine wears down over time. The effects of the vaccine generally only last one flu season, so getting a yearly flu shot is the best way to maintain immunity. Also, the flu shot is slightly different each year because it is tailored to the most dominant strains of the virus. Getting a yearly flu shot will ensure you get the strongest, most up-to-date protection possible. Myth #4: It’s not peak flu season, so it’s too early to get a flu shot.Truth #4: The best time to get a flu shot is in October, before peak flu season.Peak flu season is between December and January, but you should get your flu shot before the virus starts spreading in your community. Early fall is the best time to get your flu shot, ideally in September or October. The CDC recommends you receive a flu shot by the end of October each year.Myth #5: I can’t remember the last time I had the flu, so I probably won’t get it this year.Truth #5: The 2022-2023 flu season is expected to be more severe than in recent years with more widespread infection.During the COVID-19 pandemic, the flu season was milder than average, according to the CDC. Mask mandates, social distancing, a better awareness of hand washing hygiene and people being more vigilant about staying home when sick prevented the flu from spreading as much as usual. However, as protective measures against COVID-19 relax, the risk of infection (for any virus, flu and COVID-19 alike) increases. Also, this season’s flu strains are expected to lead to more flu cases. U.S. infectious disease experts base their flu season predictions on data from the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season peaks sooner. This year, Australia had its worst flu season in recent years, with infection rates surpassing pre-pandemic levels. This indicates flu cases in our area will likely be higher than usual.With the COVID-19 virus still circulating in the community and more widespread flu expected, it is more important than ever to get vaccinated to protect yourself and others. You can get both the COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine at the same time. We encourage you to get a flu shot wherever it is convenient for you. Many local pharmacies and retailers offer walk-in vaccinations. You can also receive your flu shot through the Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin health network.Sonya Hollingsworth, MD, is a family medicine physician who sees patients at the HFM Harbor Town Campus.

The individual did not require hospitalization. “Historically, we begin seeing flu cases in December and this early confirmed case is a reminder not to delay getting a flu vaccine,” said John Felton, President and CEO of RiverStone Health and the Yellowstone County Health Officer. “Australia is experiencing its worst flu season in several years and if that country’s experience is a predictor, we could be in for a severe flu season, so I am encouraging everyone to get vaccinated.” A yearly flu vaccine is recommended for everyone six months of age and older. season but a new dose is needed each year because the type of flu viruses circulating change from year to year. Influenza is a serious contagious disease that can lead to hospitalization and even death. The disease spreads through coughing and sneezing with symptoms that can include high fever, chills, headaches, exhaustion, sore throat, cough and body aches. It may take about 1 to 4 days after being exposed to the virus for symptoms to develop. Additionally, you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick. Individuals with chronic medical conditions, the elderly, pregnant women and young children are at particularly high risk of becoming very ill from influenza. Vaccine options include a quadrivalent shot which covers four different influenza viruses and a high-dose flu shot approved for people age 65 and older. Everyday precautions can help stop the spread of influenza. Those measures include: Covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Washing your hands often with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth Avoiding close contact with sick people. If you are sick with a flu-like illness, stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone except to get medical care or necessities. Your fever should be gone without the use of a fever-reducing medicine. While sick, limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from infecting them.

Download PDF Copy By Bhavana KunkalikarReviewed by Aimee MolineuxSep 27 2022 In a recent study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, researchers calculated the decrease in vaccine effectiveness due to repeated influenza vaccinations. Study: Does repeated influenza vaccination attenuate effectiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis. Image Credit: BaLL LunLa/Shutterstock Circulating viruses, especially influenza A(H3N2) viruses, experience fast antigenic drift that necessitates vaccine reconfiguration. Since vaccination-induced protection against homologous strains may decrease, influenza vaccines must be administered afresh yearly. In several nations, a yearly seasonal influenza vaccine is currently advised. However, repeated injections of vaccination may reduce its effectiveness. About the study In the present study, researchers conducted a thorough review and meta-analysis of trials reporting vaccine efficacy by vaccination status from the prior year. Throughout this systematic review and meta-analysis, the team adhered to PRISMA standards. For publications published between January 1, 2016, and June 13, 2022, the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched. For research published in English between the beginning of the database and June 13, 2022, the team searched the Web of Science. Additionally, the team looked through reference lists and MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL Complete databases for non-English language research until December 31, 2015. Four comparison groups, including vaccinations administered in the present season only, the previous season, the current season and the previous season, and neither season were created. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials that reported vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza were reported. Two reviewers carried out screening, data extraction, and risk of bias analyses separately. Extracted information comprised research, patient characteristics, and odds ratio estimates for each season's vaccination efficacy according to age group and type of influenza virus. The absolute difference in vaccine efficacy (VE) between those who received vaccinations during the current and prior seasons (VECP) and those who received vaccinations solely during the current season (VEC) was estimated. If inoculated during the current and past seasons and not in the current season, VE more than zero suggests greater vaccine efficacy. By season and age group for each vaccination group, the team calculated pooled vaccine efficacy for influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B. For the primary examination of each type, estimates of vaccination efficacy for the largest age group, such as all ages or nine years or more, were utilized for the A subtype or B lineage. Estimates from studies that solely provided data on vaccine effectiveness for a certain age group (such as children) were excluded. Estimates from the northern and southern hemispheres that used the same vaccine formulation were grouped. Results The study results showed that 681 of the 4979 unduplicated papers found were full-text analyses. Eighty-three publications met the eligibility criteria. All the included research—including five cohort studies, six case-control studies, and 72 test-negative studies—were observational. Most of them were conducted in North America and Europe. The earliest season was 2007–2008, while the earliest eligible study was published on February 17, 2011. Related StoriesSeasonal influenza adapted and evolved during the COVID-19 pandemicStudy finds minority patients less likely to refuse vaccinesCleveland Clinic presents new findings on triple-negative breast cancer vaccineIn 95% of the investigations, reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect influenza infection. Among these, 5% of the studies used a rapid diagnostic test. Outpatient settings accounted for 51% of the 83 studies, inpatient for 23%, outpatient and inpatient for 16%, and community settings for 10%. In 49% of the studies, influenza vaccination was verified by medical record or registry, 17% by self-report, 31% by a combination of medical record or registry and self-report, and 4.8% by an unspecified technique. In all investigations, patients were considered to be vaccinated if the vaccination occurred at least 14 days before the onset of symptoms. Of the 83 investigations, trivalent inactivated vaccinations were utilized in 60% of the studies. Almost 24% of the 83 studies that constituted systematic reviews produced a total of 27 estimates of the vaccine's efficacy against seasonal generalized influenza. As per 14 estimations, only immunization during the present season was more successful. On the other hand, vaccination during the previous season was more effective, according to one estimate. Approximately 5% of all assessed trials compared the vaccine efficacy for different outcomes, including intensive care unit admission, hospital death within 30 days of admission, influenza-associated severe acute respiratory (SAR) infection, and hospitalization of patients with diabetes. According to the majority of estimations, those who received vaccinations during the present season and past seasons had significantly higher vaccine effectiveness than those who received vaccinations solely during the current season. Estimates of combined vaccine efficacy against influenza A (H3N2) were poor compared to those for other types like A subtypes or B lineages. Vaccine efficacy for the current season only group was 37%, for the current season and the previous season group was 20%; and for the previous season only group was 9%. Except for 2013–14, estimates of the seasonal pooled vaccination effectiveness for the current and prior season groups were lower than those for the current season only group. In both the current and prior season groups, the reduced season-specific pooled vaccine efficacy estimates were most prominent in 2014–15. Conclusion The study findings showed that vaccination administered against influenza in two consecutive years offered greater protection as compared to when no vaccine was administered, even though vaccination in the year prior reduces the effectiveness of the vaccine. However, the estimated effects of vaccination received in the prior year are not consistent or severe enough to recommend a different vaccination strategy at this time.

Cold & FluStay Safe This Flu SeasonShare this articleShareShare on FacebookShare on XShare on PinterestCopy Link8 Ways to Keep the Flu From Spreading Through Your HouseholdThe influenza virus is highly contagious, so if you or someone else brings it home, do all you can to keep it contained.ByJohanna NeesonMedically ReviewedbyJennifer Rooke, MD, MPHPublished on September 26, 2022An air purifier can be a worthy investment during flu season — especially for people living in close quarters.Getty ImagesLike most infectious diseases, the seasonal flu is highly contagious: All it takes is an uncovered sneeze to send the influenza virus that causes flu into the air, where anyone in close proximity can breathe it in (or pick it up off a surface after it lands) and wind up sick.It’s no wonder, then, that within households, if one person comes down with the flu, there’s a good chance others will wind up sick too. One study found, for example, the risk of flu spreading within a single dwelling is around 38 percent.Families, roommates, and others who live together can beat those odds, though, starting with annual flu vaccines all around for every household member who’s eligible for one. But given that getting a flu shot isn’t a guarantee you won’t get sick (the vaccine is around 40 to 60 percent effective), taking other precautions to prevent the flu from spreading is prudent.1. Wash Your HandsDo it frequently and fervently. That means after sneezing and coughing, coming in from outside, shaking hands, and especially before eating or touching your face or someone else’s, urges Mike Hoaglin, MD, medical advisor for DrHouse and supervising virtual care physician at Oscar Medical Group and Brightside Health in San Francisco.To make sure your hand-washing routine is effective, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises using warm water and soap and taking care to lather the backs of your hands and between your fingers for at least 20 seconds. (An easy way to count it out is to sing the “Happy Birthday” song twice.) Use a fresh towel, preferably a paper towel, to dry your hands completely.2. Isolate“Many infection control measures we learned during COVID apply to influenza,” notes Laura Purdy, MD, chief medical officer at OpenLoop telehealth platform and a family physician in Fort Benning, Georgia.If you have flu symptoms, test positive for flu, or even suspect you may have been exposed to someone who’s sick, put as much space as possible between you and the people you live with (and have others do the same if the flu is on the other foot, so to speak). If there’s a bedroom or other spare room available, that’s ideal, especially if someone is able to deliver meals and other must-haves.At the very least, advises Dr. Hoaglin, stay away from common areas for at least three or four days, when the virus is most contagious.3. Designate a CaregiverIf a small child, elderly person, or someone else who needs to be cared for has flu, pick one person for the job. That will limit the number of people who come in contact with the virus and cut the risk of it spreading.Whoever the designated caregiver turns out to be, it’s important they take every precaution to protect themselves — even if they’ve already had the flu. “I’ve been surprised by the number of people who catch the flu more than once in a season,” says Dr. Purdy.4. Gear UpAs with the COVID virus, one of most effective ways to prevent the spread of influenza is by wearing a mask — preferably an N95 mask, advises Michael Roizen, MD, chief wellness officer emeritus at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. That goes for anyone who is sick, to keep their viral droplets out of the air, and for those who are well, to shield themselves.If you’re caring for a child or someone else who has flu, slipping on disposable gloves is a good idea too, as it will lower the risk of picking up the virus with your fingers and then touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.5. Clear the AirProper ventilation of common spaces and individual rooms is important, says Hoaglin. Whether you crack a few windows or plug in an air purifier, it can help reduce the volume of infectious particles in the air.Consider doing this even before someone comes home sick, as well as when you have a gathering of people.6. Keep Things CleanThe flu virus can live on hard surfaces for up to 48 hours, meaning everything from countertops, doorknobs, and cell phones to TV remotes, drinkware, and eating utensils —especially those touched or used by someone who’s ill.Make use of disinfectant wipes, sprays, and other cleaning solutions that contain hydrogen peroxide, chlorine, and/or alcohol, which can kill germs immediately and on contact. Stash alcohol-based cleaners throughout your home so they’re handy for everyone, suggests Hoaglin.7. Trash the VirusStudies show the influenza virus can survive for 8 to 12 hours on cloth and paper. Consider a temporary switch from hand towels and dishcloths to single-use paper products.Then take care to dispose of used paper products promptly by tossing them into a trashcan, preferably one lined with a plastic bag, and don’t set them down anywhere or let them come in contact with someone else.8. Do an Immune System BoostSome simple ways to help fight off infection are also healthy lifestyle measures. One is to stay well-hydrated, which supports the circulatory system in delivering nutrients to organs throughout the body and to remove waste products — including potentially infectious microbes.The U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends males get about 15.5 cups of fluid each day and females get 11.5 cups. Not all fluid needs to be water, according to the Mayo Clinic. Non-caloric beverages, including coffee and tea, count too, as do juicy fruits and veggies and fluid-based foods such as soup.Vitamin C may help as well. Although the once-popular theory that high doses of C may help prevent or cure the common cold has never been proven, there is evidence C may be able to kill influenza A and other viruses. And it can never hurt to include plenty of C-rich foods in your diet: citrus fruits, bell peppers, strawberries, tomatoes, white potatoes, and broccoli, cabbage, and other cruciferous vegetables.Consider (carefully) catching some rays as well, to boost your intake of vitamin D, which plays a key role in shoring up the immune system. The National Institutes of Health advises wearing sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15 if you’re in the sun longer than a few minutes, and eating plenty of D-dense foods, such as fortified dairy products, fatty fish, and even mushrooms: Sometimes the fungi are exposed the ultraviolet light to boost their vitamin D content.Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkJennifer Rooke, MD, MPHMedical ReviewerJennifer Rooke, MD, MPH, is an associate professor of community health and preventive medicine at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta.

Combinations of antivirals may reduce the likelihood of drug resistance and improve clinical outcomes. Previously, two hospitalised immunocompromised influenza patients, who received a combination of a neuraminidase inhibitor and baloxavir marboxil, shed influenza viruses resistant to both drugs. Here-in, the replicative fitness of one of these A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates with dual resistance mutations (NA-H275Y and PA-I38T) was similar to wild type virus (WT) in vitro, but reduced in the upper respiratory tracts of challenged ferrets. The dual-mutant virus transmitted well between ferrets in an airborne transmission model, but was outcompeted by the WT when the two viruses were co-administered. These results indicate the dual-mutant virus had a moderate loss of viral fitness compared to the WT virus, suggesting that while person-to-person transmission of the dual-resistant virus may be possible, widespread community transmission is unlikely.

Influenza seasonal epidemics may cause up to 1 billion infections and 650,000 deaths worldwide each year1,2. In combination with seasonal influenza vaccines, antiviral drugs are an important tool in reducing the disease burden of infected patients, particularly in a pandemic setting, where unavoidable manufacturing and testing requirements will delay vaccine development for a novel strain. As a result, many countries maintain antiviral stockpiles as a pandemic contingency3. The most recent influenza pandemic occurred in 2009 when a novel influenza A(H1N1) pandemic virus emerged from a swine-origin virus that had undergone several reassortment events, allowing efficient transmission in humans and rapid global spread4,5.There are currently five licensed influenza antiviral drugs recommended for clinical use, although not all are available globally. These include four neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), oseltamivir (OST), zanamivir (ZAN), laninamivir (LAN) and peramivir (PER), and a single polymerase acidic (PA) endonuclease inhibitor, baloxavir marboxil. Adamantanes (or M2 inhibitors) are a class of licensed antivirals that have been discontinued from clinical use since 2009, because most circulating viruses are resistant due to the S31N amino acid (AA) substitution in the M2 gene6,7. In 2008-2009, widespread resistance to OST and PER occurred due to the neuraminidase (NA) substitution H275Y that was identified in 93-100% of influenza A(H1N1) viruses characterised globally8,9.Baloxavir marboxil (BXM), a recently developed inhibitor of the PA cap-dependent endonuclease, has been shown to rapidly reduce viral shedding and reduce symptom duration and complications associated with influenza infection10,11. However, BXM treatment can select for influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility to this drug, with the most commonly detected resistance mutation being PA-I38T. In clinical trials, post-treatment influenza virus analysis showed that 2-10% of adults and approximately 20% of children shed virus with a PA-I38T substitutions (or other variants at this locus)10,12,13,14,15,16. The selection of treatment-emergent NA-H275Y17,18 or PA-I38T12,16 viruses has been associated with longer time to symptom alleviation in some patients compared to patients infected with drug susceptible viruses19. In the event that drug resistant viruses emerge, switching from OST to BXM treatment has been shown to improve clinical outcomes for infections with OST-resistant NA-H275Y influenza viruses20,21,22. Surveillance data on the antiviral susceptibility of circulating seasonal influenza viruses from patients in the community (most of whom had not been treated with an antiviral) are reported regularly by the WHO global influenza surveillance and response system. In general, the frequency of viruses tested with reduced susceptibility to at least one of the NAIs or BXM in globally circulating influenza viruses has been very low, at <1% of viruses tested in 2018-2020. However, in Japan, where BXM was more routinely used, the incidence of viruses with reduced susceptibility to BXM was 4.5% (41/991) during 2018-201923. More recently influenza viruses collected from February 2021 to February 2022 revealed only two out of 2953 (0.07%) influenza viruses with reduced inhibition by NAIs (A246V and D197N), and only one of 2443 (0.04%) influenza viruses with reduced susceptibility to BXM (PA-E23K)24,25, however, this was during an unusual period of very low global circulation of influenza viruses as a consequence of the measures taken to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.Combination antiviral drug therapy is the cornerstone for treating chronic infections by viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis C to avoid the generation of resistance26 and may offer similar advantages in treating severe cases of influenza27,28,29,30. Combination therapy with OST and BXM in mice was more effective than either monotherapy to prevent the selection of treatment-emergent resistant influenza viruses29. A phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study was conducted by Hoffmann-La Roche in 2019-2020 (FLAGSTONE; NCT03684044) to assess the efficacy and safety of the standard of care NAI (often OST, depending on individual hospital practises) treatment in combination with BXM (or placebo) in hospitalised adolescents and adults patients (≥12 years) with severe influenza. In this study, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with treatment-emergent dual-mutations (NA-H275Y and PA-I38T) were identified in two immunocompromised (undergoing cancer treatment) patients treated with OST or PER in combination with BXM. These viruses were considered to have reduced susceptibility to OST, PER and BXM31.The spread of viruses with reduced susceptibility to BXM and OST/PER in the community would severely reduce current treatment options for influenza. However, the fitness and transmissibility of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza viruses with NA-H275Y and PA-I38T dual substitutions is unknown. This study assessed the replicative capacity, airborne transmissibility and relative fitness of such viruses isolated from patient samples using in vitro assays and the ferret challenge model.ResultsIn vitro characterisation of virus isolates containing single and double mutant NA-H275Y and PA-I38T virusesOriginal respiratory clinical samples from a 71-year-old South Korean female patient infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, who was participating in the FLAGSTONE study31, were obtained and sequenced from Day 1 (d1), Day 4 (d4) and Day 10 (d10) of study enrolment, and the proportions of viruses with NA-H275Y, PA-I38T and PA-P325Q were determined as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Purified virus clones were obtained by two rounds of plaque purification from these original isolates, and the resulting viruses were then sequenced to confirm that pure isolates of the desired genotype had been obtained; wild type virus (WT), which had NA-H275 and PA-I38, a single mutant with NA-H275Y, a single mutant with PA-I38T, and a double mutant with NA-H275Y + PA-I38T. We also noted three additional mutations in these isolates; PA-P325Q, which occurred in the patient before antiviral treatment, as well as hemagglutinin (HA)-A204T (H1 numbering, beginning from Met) and viral polymerase 1 (PB1)-Y129H mutations that occurred only after passaging the WT virus in cell culture (Supplementary Table 1).Susceptibility to baloxavir acid (BXA; the active form of BXM) and all four NAIs, oseltamivir carboxylate (OSC; the active form of OST), PER, LAN, and ZAN, were determined by phenotypic assays for all four viruses. Virus isolates with PA-I38T demonstrated highly reduced susceptibility to BXA (EC50 fold change of 373 for PA-I38T and 190 for NA-H275Y + PA-I38T; when compared to the EC50 of PA-I38 wild type A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses). Virus isolates with NA-H275Y (NA-H275Y and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T) demonstrated highly reduced susceptibility to OSC and PER (IC50 fold change of both viruses of approximately 600 to OSC and approximately 100 to PER when compared to the IC50 of NA-H275 wild type A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses). There was no change in susceptibility against LAN or ZAN (IC50 fold change <3) for any of the mutant viruses. All isolates with a wild type PA (I38) and/or NA (H275), demonstrated sensitivity to BXA or all four NAIs, respectively (Supplementary Table 2).The replication kinetics of the WT, NA-H275Y single mutant, PA-I38T single mutant and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T double mutant viruses were analysed in vitro. Influenza virus replication at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) (5) sampled over 12 h and at a low MOI (0.01) over 102 h were performed to assess single- or multi-stage viral replication, respectively. No substantial differences were observed between the replication kinetics of each virus when assessed at a high or low MOI, although the PA-I38T single mutant appeared to have a slightly delayed replication in the single-stage experiment (Fig. 1). Pyrosequencing analysis also confirmed that each virus maintained (at 95-100%) their relevant substitution at AA positions, NA-275 and PA-38, at 102 h post infection, indicating none of the mutants had reverted to the WT genotype (Supplementary Table 3). Overall, double and single mutant virus replication profiles remained similar to WT.Fig. 1: Virus growth in single and multi-stage replication cycles.MDCK cells were infected with virus isolates containing one or both NA-H275Y and PA-I38T mutations. a Single-stage replication assay (MOI 5) with sampling every 2 h for a total of 12 h. b Multi-stage replication assay (MOI 0.01) and sampled at 6, 24, 30, 48, 54, 72, 78, 96, 102 h. Infectious virus in the supernatant was quantified by TCID50. Each symbol represents the mean amount of virus present at each time point and the error bars depict one standard deviation (SD). Data in each graph is the combination of three independently conducted experiments performed in triplicate. Limit of detection (LOD) is shown as a dotted horizontal line, all values below LOD equal two log10TCID50/mL. No statistically significant differences (adjusted p < 0.05) were observed (Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons).Full size imageFerret in-host replication fitness of the double mutant clinical isolate virusTo determine the replication fitness of the double mutant virus (NA-H275Y + PA-I38T) in the upper and lower respiratory tract (U/LRT), ferrets were infected with either WT or the double mutant NA-H275Y + PA-I38T isolates. Nasal washes were collected daily for 9 days post-inoculation to quantify the viral load in the URT. Based on infectious virus load in the URT, the replication of both viruses was comparable for the first 3 days following infection, but on days four, five and six, the mean viral load in the URT of animals infected with double mutant NA-H275Y + PA-I38T virus was significantly lower (by 1.59, 1.75, and 2.73 log10TCID50/mL on day 4, 5 and 6, respectively) when compared to ferrets infected with the WT virus. The duration of viral shedding was 1 day shorter for NA-H275Y + PA-I38T infected animals (5 days, 4/4 ferrets) than WT infected animals (6 days, 4/4 ferrets). Area under the curve (AUC) analysis of mean nasal wash viral titres revealed NA-H275Y + PA-I38T infected ferrets had a lower AUC (17.98 ± 1.43) than WT infected ferrets (25.77 ± 1.29) (Fig. 2a). While infectious viral titres shed from the URT were significantly different between the two isolates, quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis was not (Supplementary Fig 2a).Fig. 2: Viral shedding and lung lobe viral load of WT and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T virus isolate infected ferrets.Ferrets (n = 8) infected by the intranasal route with 4 log10TCID50/mL (in 500 µL of PBS) with WT (d1 isolate, black) or NA-H275Y + PA-I38T (d10 isolate, red) purified virus isolates were nasally washed daily for 9 days. Half of the ferrets were culled at day five post-inoculation to harvest the five major lung lobes. a The viral shedding from the ferret nasal washes was measured by TCID50 assay. b Viral titre of each homogenised lung lobe aliquot wase enumerated using a TCID50 assay, the fraction representing the number of major lung lobes with detectable viral titres (above LOD) per ferret. Each dot represents the titre in a single lung lobe and the line shows the mean. Error bars represent one SD. LOD is shown as a dotted horizontal line, all values beyond LOD equal zero viral titre. Adjusted p-values and asterisks show statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences (Two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons).Full size imageTo quantify the pulmonary viral load, the infectious viral titre was determined in the five major lung lobes at day five post-inoculation. Three of four ferrets in both infection groups (WT or NA-H275Y + PA-I38T) had infectious virus present in two or more lung lobes (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig 2c). qPCR analysis of each lung lobe was consistent with virus titration data, showing similar viral load between WT or NA-H275Y + PA-I38T inoculated ferrets (Supplementary Fig 2b). We also observed by WGS that the NA-H275Y and PA-I38T mutations were unchanged in the virus samples recovered from ferret lungs, and no other amino acid changes from virus inoculum were detected (sequences as per Supplementary Table 1). Overall, virus titres detected in the lungs of WT and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T infected ferrets were comparable. We also compared infected ferrets for clinical signs, including weight and body temperature, which was monitored once daily, which revealed no significant differences between WT and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T infected animals (Supplementary Fig 3).Ferret airborne transmission studyAirborne transmission chains were initiated by inoculating donor animals that were housed adjacent to naïve recipient ferrets (RF) but separated by a perforated metal barrier, allowing the transfer of airborne virus only. For WT and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T viruses, transmission events from donor to the first recipient ferret (RF1) and RF1 to the second recipient ferret (RF2) were detected by nasal wash qPCR analysis cycle threshold <30 (matrix gene Ct value) within 2–3 days post exposure. The mean infectious virus titres shed for each group of ferrets is shown in Fig. 3a–c (individual ferret nasal wash titres shown in Supplementary Fig 4). The AUC analysis showed that overall infectious virus titres were lower in the NA-H275Y + PA-I38T infected ferrets compared to WT, with an AUC reduction of 28% in donors (p = 0.13), 29% in RF1 (p = 0.0005) and 26% in RF2 (p = 0.0038) (Fig. 3d), reinforcing the data from the previous experiment (Fig. 2a). Although statistically significant differences were not observed for the duration of viral shedding between WT and the NA-H275Y + PA-I38T infected animals (Fig. 3e), a consistent trend of ~1 day shorter duration of viral shedding was observed in ferrets infected with NA-H275Y + PA-I38T compared to WT infected ferrets, across donor, RF1 and RF2 animals (Fig. 3f). The qPCR analysis revealed closely matched viral RNA load in both WT and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T infected ferrets over time (Supplementary Fig 5).Fig. 3: Infectious viral shedding in nasal washes from ferrets infected with WT or NA-H275Y + PA-I38T clinical isolates and in ferrets infected by airborne virus exposure.Donor ferrets (n = 4) were infected by the intranasal route with 5 log10TCID50/mL of pure WT or NA-H275Y + PA-I38T clinically isolated virus and co-housed with naïve recipient ferret 1 (RF1) separated by an airborne virus-permeable barrier at day 1 (D1) post inoculation. Infected RF1s were then co-housed with RF2 ferrets, enabling a second airborne transmission event to occur. Viral titre mean from nasal washes from donor (a), RF1 (b) and RF2 ferrets (c), by TCID50 assay. Fractions above each symbol represent the number of ferrets shedding virus above LOD (dotted horizontal line), all values below LOD equal zero. No statistically significant (adjusted p < 0.05) differences was observed (Sidak’s Two-way ANOVA multiple comparisons). d Area under the curve analysis was performed for each individual ferret (n = 4) and overall viral shedding was compared between WT (black) and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T (D.Mt, red). e Duration of infectious viral shedding above LOD was tallied for each ferret. f Estimation plot of the combined duration of viral shedding for all donor, RF1 and RF2 ferrets was analysed by Unpaired t-test to display a 95% confidence interval of the difference between the mean duration of shedding for WT and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T infected ferrets. Error bars indicate one SD. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were compared by Tukey’s Ordinary One-way ANOVA.Full size imageThe WT and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T infected ferrets were also assessed for clinical signs such as weight loss and body temperature. RF1 and RF2 animals showed no significant difference in weight loss or body temperature during WT or NA-H275Y + PA-I38T influenza virus infection. One of the four NA-H275Y + PA-I38T infected animals suffered more severe weight loss and was euthanised due to its condition on D11 (Supplementary Fig 6).Ferret nasal washes with detectable virus (>2 log10TCID50/mL) from the transmission study were analysed by pyrosequencing to determine the viral genotype at the PA-38 and NA-275 AA positions. Sequence data from the nasal washes infected with WT virus confirmed that all four WT infected donor ferrets transmitted approximately 100% PA-I38 + NA-H275 virus through to RF1 and onward to RF2 animals (Supplementary Fig 7a). NA-H275Y + PA-I38T infected ferrets also shed virus with sequences consistent with the inoculum genotype, at approximately 100% PA-I38T + NA-H275Y, with the exception of Group I RF1 ferrets whose nasal washes had a mixed proportion of WT and double mutant virus genotypes, which resulted in the infection and shedding of pure (approximately 100%) WT virus to the next recipient ferret (Group I RF2) (Supplementary Fig 7b).Competitive mixture airborne transmission studyTo explore more subtle differences between the replicative and transmission fitness dynamics of the NA-H275Y + PA-I38T and WT viruses, a competitive mixture airborne transmission ferret study was performed with an initial challenge inoculum mixture of both WT and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T at an approximate 50%:50% ratio (based on pyrosequencing analysis). The viral titres from daily nasal washes demonstrated successful donor infection and onward transmission for each group of ferrets (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig 8). To measure the head-to-head fitness, nasal washes with detectable virus by TCID50 were analysed by pyrosequencing at the PA-38 and NA-275 loci to determine the proportion of WT or mutant virus. Pyrosequencing analysis of the donor ferret inoculum showed that instead of the desired 50:50 mixture, a mixture of approximately 60:40 WT:NA-H275Y + PA-I38T viruses was given to the donor ferrets. All four donor nasal washes showed a similar proportion of WT:NA-H275Y + PA-I38T to that of the inoculum at day 2 post-inoculation (bottom bar of each donor bar chart of Fig. 4b), however the proportion of WT gradually increased to become the dominant virus shed from donor ferrets (approximately 90% WT) by the last day of viral shedding (day 7 or 8). Donor to RF1 airborne transmission seeded approximately 100% pure WT virus in three of the four recipient ferrets, which resulted in three pure WT infected RF2 animals. The remaining Group C RF1 animal shed a mixed virus population at day 2 post exposure, which resulted in the shedding of pure (90-100%) single mutant NA-H275 + PA-I38T virus from both Group C RF1 and RF2. Overall, the pyrosequencing data revealed a competitive fitness advantage of WT over H275Y + PA-I38T virus within the donor ferrets, and after onward transmission the proportion of WT virus increased to 100% in 3 out of 4 of the RF1 and RF2 ferret transmission groups (Fig. 4c–d).Fig. 4: Infectious virus titres and pyrosequencing analysis of ferret nasal washes from 50:50 WT:NA-H275Y + PA-I38T clinical isolate inoculated donor and airborne transmission infected recipient ferrets.Donor ferrets (n = 4) were infected via the intranasal route with 5 log10TCID50/mL with 50:50 WT: NA-H275Y + PA-I38T clinically isolated virus and co-housed with naïve recipient ferrets (RF1) virus separated by an airborne virus permeable barrier, infected RF1s were then co-housed with RF2 ferrets. Nasal wash samples were titrated by TCID50 assay for each Group A-D Donor-RF1-RF2 transmission pairs, LOD is shown as a dotted horizontal line, and all values beyond LOD equal zero viral titre (a). The relative proportion of virus encoding WT PA (white bars) and PA-I38T (dark blue bars) and WT NA (white bars) and NA-H275Y (light blue bars) were determined by pyrosequencing analysis and are shown side-by-side in bar charts for each donor (b), RF1 (c) and RF2 (d) ferret.Full size imageGenotype analysis of ferret nasal washesPyrosequencing analysis unexpectedly revealed the rapid emergence of a PA-I38T single mutant virus from the 50:50 WT:NA-H275Y + PA-I38T inoculated Group C donor to the RF1 animal (Fig. 4). To investigate the origin of the single mutant PA-I38T virus further, individual virus plaques were grown, picked and analysed by pyrosequencing at positions NA-275 and PA-38 to determine the proportion of the WT, single mutant or double mutant viruses present in nasal washes from the ferrets. The genotype of 42 to 92 distinct plaques from representative Group C nasal wash samples were analysed, as well as two distinct Group B nasal wash samples, as a comparison group that did not demonstrate single mutant virus genotype emergence. Firstly, the WT and NA-H275 + PA-I38T purified virus stocks and 50:50 mixed inoculum were confirmed to be pure virus populations that did not contain detectable PA-I38T single mutant virus. However, analysis of two 50:50 WT:NA-H275 + PA-I38T inoculated donor ferret nasal washes (at day 2 post inoculation) revealed that Group C had a mixture of 17/65 (26%) plaques with a PA-I38T single mutant genotype and 6/65 (9%) NA-H275Y single mutants and Group B also had a mixed virus population with all four possible genotypes detected. Therefore the origin of PA-I38T single mutant infection in the Group C ferrets was likely to have been from the donor ferret, which resulted in 32/48 (67%) PA-I38T genotype plaques by day 5 in RF2 (Table 1).Table 1 Pyrosequencing analysis at NA-275 and PA-38 of individual plaque picks grown from clinical isolate, ferret inoculum and representative nasal wash samples from the competitive mixture airborne transmission study.Full size tableThe above results suggest that reassortment events between the WT and double mutant virus may be the source of the single mutant NA-H275Y and PA-I38T viruses generated from 50:50 mixture inoculated donor ferrets. To investigate if reassortment occurred, influenza virus whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on the ferret inoculum samples and representative nasal washes, capturing the potential genetic changes occurring from donor to RF1 to RF2 within at least one transmission group of each pure and mixed inoculum experimental group. All sequenced viruses were genetically identical apart from five AA changes on four genes (including NA-H275Y, PA-I38T, PA-P325Q, HA-A204T and PB1-Y129H), which differed between the WT and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T plaque purified clinical isolates. The five AAs of interest remained stable throughout transmission events of the pure WT Group G and the pure NA-H275Y + PA-I38T Group L infected ferrets. However, the pure NA-H275Y + PA-I38T Group I infected ferrets (where the RF1 viral infection became a mixture with WT virus, potentially as a result of contamination) revealed evidence of reassortment with the WT virus, given the RF2 shed pure virus with a WT sequence on the PA and NA genes (PA-I38, PA-P325, NA-H275), and double mutant virus associated sequence on the HA and PB1 genes (HA-A204 and PB1-Y129). Reassortment also occurred in the 50:50 WT:NA-H275Y + PA-I38T inoculated Group B and C ferrets, confirming the reassortment of gene segments from both virus inoculums in the Group C transmission group that resulted in a dominant single mutant PA-I38T virus infection (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 4).Fig. 5: Summary of whole-genome sequencing on ferret inoculum and nasal wash samples from pure WT, pure NA-H275Y + PA-I38T and 50% WT: 50%NA-H275Y + PA-I38T isolate infected ferrets.Ferret inoculum and nasal wash samples post inoculation/exposure (PI/E) from pure WT, pure NA-H275Y + PA-I38T or 50% WT: 50%NA-H275Y + PA-I38T virus infected ferrets were sequenced using WGS. Five amino acid (AA) changes (across the HA, NA, PA and PB1 genes) distinguished ferret inoculum WT and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T virus genotypes. The bar charts display the proportion of AA codon changes detected by NGS for each sample associated with the WT (white) and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T (black) virus inoculum for each gene loci (along X-axis; HA-294, NA-275, PA-38, PA-325, PB1-129). Percentage frequency of AA codons is determined from variant bases called with a read depth over 1000 and frequency of greater than 5%.

Three respiratory samples were obtained from this patient and four viruses were isolated from these samples; a WT isolate with no antiviral resistance mutations (NA-H275 and PA-I38), separate single resistance mutation isolates with either NA-H275Y (causing PER/OST resistance) or PA-I38T (causing BXM resistance), and an isolate with both resistance mutations NA-H275Y + PA-I38T (causing resistance to both PER/OST and BXM). Testing of these isolates indicated that while the dual-resistant isolate had comparable replicative fitness to the WT isolate in vitro, it replicated to lower viral titres and was cleared more rapidly from the upper respiratory tract of ferrets compared to the WT isolate. However, when viral titres in the lungs were examined on day five post-inoculation, no clear difference was observed between the NA-H275Y + PA-I38T and WT infected ferrets, with similar levels of pulmonary viral load as previously reported with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in ferrets32,33,34.Airborne transmission is the most common form of influenza virus spread between humans in the community35,36. We utilised the well-established ferret airborne transmission model, which relies on respiratory droplet transfer of viruses between animals, and requires a higher viral transmissibility to be achieved compared to direct contact transmission models37. Previous ferret studies have characterised A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with either OST-resistant NA-H275Y or BXM-resistant PA-I38T mutations independently. Viruses with NA-H275 demonstrated a robust within-host replicative fitness and transmission potential38,39, but some studies showed a reduced airborne transmission capacity40,41. When assessed as pure virus population, viruses with PA-I38T showed only a slight reduction in upper respiratory tract viral shedding and had equivalent airborne transmission capacity compared to WT viruses42,43,44. The double mutant NA-H275Y + PA-I38T virus isolate in our study showed successful airborne transmission to all recipient ferrets, but the nasal washes had reduced viral titres (as measured by area under the curve analysis of TCID50 results) and the virus was cleared a day earlier compared to the WT virus isolate. In contrast, the viral RNA quantification indicated no substantial difference in viral loads detected in the URT between these groups, however, this metric may be less indicative of viral fitness than TCID50 assay data, given it also measures non-infectious virions.Genetic analysis confirmed that the NA-H275Y + PA-I38T virus remained stable and did not revert to WT during in vitro and in vivo ferret studies, except for one group of ferrets infected with the double mutant virus, where the WT virus became dominant in RF1 and RF2. This outcome may have resulted from low-level contamination with the WT virus, or perhaps reversion at both loci, although this would seem an unlikely event. Previous studies have also shown that both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses with PA-I38T had good stability in ferret transmission studies43,44, but have shown limited person-to-person transmission23,45. Additionally, NA-H275Y stability has been demonstrated by widespread community transmission of the previous seasonal A(H1N1) virus in 2008-20098,9 and localised transmission in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses46,47,48.The competitive mixture ferret airborne transmission study demonstrated a consistent within-host fitness reduction for the NA-H275Y + PA-I38T virus. During these transmission events the co-administered NA-H275Y + PA-I38T virus was clearly outcompeted following the initial donor to recipient ferrets virus transmission, indicating that WT virus was transmitted preferentially during the viral airborne transmission bottleneck from Donor to RF1, as has been described by Varble et al.49. Similar competitive mixture experiments with single mutant PA-I38T and WT A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates have previously shown no significant within-host fitness cost, but a drastic between-host fitness cost compared to WT50,51, while single mutant NA-H275Y and WT competitive mixture studies have shown no significant within-host fitness cost and variable between-host fitness cost with reports of no reduction52,53 or some reduction40.Possible mechanisms that might explain the reduced competitive fitness of these mutant viruses include reduced enzymatic activity, changes in structural stability, or for the PA-I38T, increased genome replication errors resulting in additional defective interfering virus particles (DIVP). Enzymatic efficacy studies of the PA-I38T mutation have shown that this change reduced endonuclease enzymatic activity15,43, although polymerase complex activity was unchanged (or higher), compared to the WT virus polymerase43,51. Computational structural analysis of NA-H275Y may indicate impaired stability compared to WT, although this virus also contains the NA mutations N369K and V241I, which were demonstrated by Hurt et al. to restore stability46. Our study did not find any differences in the proportion DIVP in the nasal wash samples from WT or NA-H275Y + PA-I38T infected ferrets as determined by WGS (looking for large deletions in individual gene segments). Hence, the true mechanism for the observed decrease in competitive fitness of this dual-mutant virus is likely to be multifaceted that may be difficult to fully elucidate.Further NGS analysis of one of the outliers in the competitive mixtures study, where an RF1 ferret in Group C (Fig. 4) generated a predominantly single mutant PA-I38T infection (which was then transmitted effectively to RF2), showed that reassortment occurred between the WT and NA-H275Y + PA-I38T virus mixture, following the initial infection of the Group C donor ferret. This was apparent as the two substitutions detected in PA (I38T and P325Q) were always detected in identical proportions, indicating that a whole gene segment reassortment event had occurred and not a site-specific recombination or reversion event. Similar reassortment events have been described previously by Goldhill et al., who also observed the emergence of a single mutant viruses from a ferret inoculated with a mixture of WT and a favipiravir-resistant double mutant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus54. Another study by Richard et al.55 detailed rapid influenza virus reassortment across all eight genes within co-infected URT cells of ferrets with a mixture of WT and a mutant A(H1N1)pdm09 virus with a silent substitution tagging each influenza virus gene. Their study also confirmed that reassortment only occurred when WT and variant-labelled influenza viruses were inoculated into the same anatomical compartment of the ferret respiratory tract55. These studies, alongside our results, suggest that reassortment is likely to have occurred in all four WT and double mutant virus co-infected donor ferrets, but despite these events, the WT virus emerged as the dominant virus in the presence of both double and single mutant (NA-H275Y or PA-I38T) viruses in 3 out of 4 ferrets.The potential for the future emergence and widespread circulation of this dual PER/OST and BXM-resistant virus is unknown, but given that NA-H275Y + PA-I38T variant viruses have not been observed outside of the two immunocompromised patients in the FLAGSTONE study31 it would seem unlikely, although as yet, little PER/OST and BXM combination therapy has been used. While the double mutant virus may be capable of person-to-person transmission, based on successful airborne transmission between ferrets in this study, the reduced relative fitness observed in ferrets compared to a WT virus, suggests that this double mutant virus would be unlikely to replace an existing A(H1N1)pdm09 WT virus that was circulating in the human population.Limitations of this study include the heterogeneity present amongst the outbred ferrets used in these experiments and the small number of animals infected with each virus per group, making it difficult to elucidate subtle differences in viral kinetics. Additionally the peak viral loads in the ferret lungs may not have been fully captured at day five post inoculation, and further time points might be more informative. Infections of the lungs is important as it occurs in 30-40% of hospitalised patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, and is often associated with more severe disease56. It is also worth noting that while ferrets are the best available animal model for studies of influenza transmission, no animal model perfectly recapitulates influenza disease in humans57. Our study also did not measure the fitness of these double mutant isolate viruses in the presence of antiviral drugs, but it would be assumed that their relative fitness would be enhanced compared to drug-sensitive virus in the presence of the relevant antiviral(s).In the future, patients receiving combination therapy with OST/PER and BXM or other influenza antiviral combinations, should be closely monitored for the emergence of any drug resistant viruses. Early studies suggest that combination therapy of a neuraminidase inhibitor and BXM may reduce the incidence of resistance mutations compared to monotherapy31. This is also supported by human clinical data using OST and the unlicensed polymerase inhibitor pimodivir in combination therapy58. Therefore, combination therapy may be beneficial in hospitalised and in immunocompromised patients, where influenza virus is shed for longer periods and resistance mutations are more likely to emerge59,60,61. Dosing of both antivirals simultaneously from the start of treatment (unlike that given to the patient in this report) should reduce the risk of generating viruses with dual-resistance, and may also shorten the patient’s duration of virus shedding and symptoms compared to single or sequential antiviral therapies. This study highlights the need for continued influenza virus surveillance for drug-resistant viruses so that public health authorities can readily adapt influenza antiviral recommendations to ensure that the circulating influenza viruses remain susceptible to the antiviral drugs in use. The emergence of dual-drug resistant influenza viruses shows that continued development of new antiviral drugs against influenza might still be required for the future.Materials and methodsCellsMadin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK CCL-34) cells (ATCC, USA) were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, high glucose pyruvate; Gibco, USA). The DMEM was supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Bovogen Biologicals, Australia), 1x GlutaMAX (Gibco, USA), 1x MEM non-essential amino acid solution (Gibco, USA), 0.05% sodium bicarbonate (Gibco, USA), 20 μM HEPES (Gibco) and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco, USA). DMEM media was used for virus dilution, containing the above constituents excluding only serum, hereafter known as maintenance media. Maintenance media was also used for virus infection protocols, although media was supplemented with 8 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (SAFC Biosciences, USA), hereafter known as infection media.VirusesInfluenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolates were derived from clinical samples collected from one subject at days 1, 4 and 10 (d1, d4 and d10) post enrolment into a phase III clinical study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT0368404431). To ensure pure virus populations, the three virus samples were subjected to two rounds of plaque purification and following expansion in MDCK cells were sequenced to confirm the required genotypes had been obtained without mixed bases. These purified isolates were given the following designations; A/South Korea/90207_d1_ A/2020 (Day 1; WT); A/South Korea/90207_d1_B/2020 (Day 1; NA-H275Y); A/South Korea/90207_d4_C/2020 (Day 4; PA-I38T); A/South Korea/90207_d10_D/2020 (Day 10; NA-H275Y + PA-I38T) (Supplementary Table 1). All virus aliquots were stored at −80 °C until used. The infectious virus titre was determined prior to use (described below).Virus plaque purification assayMDCK cells seeded at 1.05 × 106 cells/3 mL in 6-well plates overnight before plates were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Virus was diluted 10-fold from 10−2 to 10−7 and 0.5 mL of inoculum was added to each well before incubation for 1 h at 35 °C/5% CO2. The virus inoculum was removed and 2 mL overlays of infection media containing 0.5% agarose were added. Plates were incubated for 3 days before distinct plaques were isolated with a pipette tip and diluted in 500 µL of maintenance media for virus propagation or genotypic analysis.Virus titration assayInfectious virus titres were determined by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay in MDCK cells, as previously described62. In brief, MDCK cells were seeded at 3 × 104 cells/100 µL into a 96-well plate and cultured overnight at 37 °C/5% CO2. 10-fold serial dilutions of virus samples were overlayed on confluent MDCKs cells following two washes with PBS, on a flat-bottom 96-well plate. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 35 °C/5% CO2 and then the virus inoculum was removed from the plates and replaced with 200 µL infection media. The plates were incubated for 3 days and virus growth was determined by red blood cell agglutination (1% turkey red blood cells in PBS). The viral titre was determined by the Reed-Muench method63.Whole-genome sequencingViral RNA was extracted from a 140 µL virus sample using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Australia). The eight influenza gene segments were then amplified by one-step RT-PCR with universal influenza A primers64 using the qSCRIPT XLT kit (Quanta). Viral DNA libraries were assembled and barcoded using the Nextera library preparation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina iSeq 100 platform. Downstream analysis of sequencing data was performed by in-house WHOCCRRI, Melbourne pipeline, outlined previously by Lee, et al.44, based on the CDC IRMA pipeline65. Consensus genotype analysis performed using Geneious Prime (Biomatters, Auckland). Variant call format was used to quantify mixed base genotypes, with a minimum variant calling threshold of 1%.Antiviral drugsA fluorometric neuraminidase inhibition assay was performed to analyse virus susceptibility against four NAIs, oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir (BCX-1812), laninamivir (R-125489) and zanamivir (kindly provided by Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, Switzerland; BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, USA; Daiichi-Sankyo, Japan and GlaxoSmithKline, Australia, respectively). 300 µM of NAI stock solution was prepared in 2x Assay Buffer (AB) (66.6 mM MES and 8 mM CaCl2 pH 6.5) and stored at −20 °C for up to 12 months.A cell-based baloxavir susceptibility assay was performed with Baloxavir acid (S-033447), an active form of BXM, which was kindly provided by Shionogi & Co. Ltd., Japan. 10 mM BXA stock solution was prepared in DMSO and stored at −80 °C.Neuraminidase inhibition assayBriefly, each clinical isolate virus was titrated to its optimum NA activity as described by Leang and Hurt66. 50 µL of diluted virus was incubated with 50 µL of oseltamivir carboxylate, peramivir, laninamivir or zanamivir at a range of concentrations (0.03–30,000 nM) for 45 min at room temperature. 50 µL of 300 µM MUNANA (2'-(4-Methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid) substrate was added to the virus and drug mixture and further incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. To terminate the reaction, 100 µL of 0.14 M NaOH in ethanol was added. The NA enzymatic activity at each NAI concentration was read using a fluorometer. JASPR v1.2 curve fitting software (kindly provided by Dr. Larisa Gubareva, CDC, USA) was used to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each virus.Cell-based BXA susceptibility assayThe susceptibility of clinical influenza viruses to BXA was determined using a cell-based assay described by Koszalka et al.67, with modifications. Briefly, all viruses were initially titrated to a standard optical density (O.D.) of 1.5–2.0. Each virus was titrated by half-log dilutions in maintenance media. MDCK cell monolayer, prepared at concentration 2.5 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate on a day prior, was washed twice with PBS and 50 µL of diluted virus was added to the cells and incubated for 90 min at 35 °C, 5% CO2. 50 µL of 2x Infection Media (DMEM maintenance media with 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin (SAFC Biosciences)) was added to the plate and incubated for 35 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. Virus was removed and the cell monolayer was washed three times with PBS and fixed with 100 µL of chilled 80% acetone for 15 min. Plates were dried at room temperature before washing with Wash Buffer (0.3% Tween20 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS) three times. 100 µL of influenza A nucleoprotein antibody MAB8251 (Millipore, USA) in 5% skim milk was added to the plate and was left overnight at 4 °C. On the following day, the monolayer was washed three times with Wash Buffer and incubated with 100 µL goat anti-mouse IgG-horse radish peroxidase (Biorad, US) for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed five times with Wash Buffer before adding 100 µL of TMB microwell peroxidase substrate system (SeroCare) to each well. The plate was incubated in the dark for 10 min at room temperature and 100 µL of 1 M Hydrochloric acid was added. The O.D. of each well was read at 450 nm using a colorimeter. To determine the virus dilution factor, a graph of O.D. against half-log virus dilutions was plot using GraphPad Prism 9.To determine the susceptibility of the virus to BXA, each virus was diluted to 1.5–2.0 O.D. in DMEM maintenance media and 50 µL was added to the MDCK cell monolayer (prepared a day prior as above). After 90 min of incubation at 35 °C, 5% CO2, 50 µL of BXA in 2x Infection Media at a range of concentrations 0.01–12,800 nM was added to the well. After 24 h of incubation, the monolayer was washed, fixed, stained and the O.D. of each well was read, as before. Based on the O.D. reading, the percentage of inhibition was calculated. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of BXA was determined using GraphPad Prism 9.Single-stage virus replication assayMDCK cells were seeded overnight at 6 × 104 cells/2 mL in 24-well plates. Confluent MDCKs were infected at a MOI of 5 for 1 h at 35 °C with virus isolates. The inoculum was then removed and replaced with 2 mL of infection media. Virus was harvested from each well at 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-h post infection. Samples were stored at −80 °C before virus titre quantification.Multi-stage virus replication assayConfluent T-25cm2 flasks of MDCK cells were inoculated at an MOI of 0.01, and incubated for 1 h at 35 °C. The inoculum was then removed and replaced with 10 mL of infection media. Virus was harvested from each flask at 6-, 24-, 30-, 48-, 54-, 72-, 78-, 96- and 102-h post infection. Supernatant aliquots were stored at −80 °C before virus titre quantification.FerretsOutbred male and female ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were obtained from commercial breeders (Animalactic Animals & Animal Products Pty Ltd, Australia) and were a minimum of 12 weeks of age and 0.6 kg in body weight. Seronegativity against the four different types/subtypes of recently circulating human influenza virus strains was confirmed by haemagglutination inhibition assay. Ferrets were housed individually in high efficiency particulate air filtered cages with ab libitum food, water and enrichment equipment throughout the experimental period. All animal procedures conducted in this study were approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee (project license no. 20033) in accordance with the Australian Government, National Health and Medical Research Council Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes (8th edition).Ferret challenge studyThe ferret in-host replication fitness study included two groups of eight ferrets inoculated with either pure WT or NA-H275Y and PA-I38T patient-derived purified influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates (n = 16). All ferrets received anaesthesia (1:1 (v/v) ketamine (100 mg/mL) and xylazine (20 mg/mL)) via intramuscular injection (IM) and 5 log10TCID50/mL units of virus in 500 µL PBS was delivered by the intranasal route (250 µL per nostril).Ferrets were sedated (Xylazine; 5 mg/kg), and subsequently monitored (clinical signs, subcutaneous microchip temperature and body weight) and nasal wash samples were collected with 1 mL of PBS daily, using methodology previously defined44. At day five post-inoculation, half of each group (four animals) were euthanised (Lethabarb; 0.5 mL/kg), and the five major lung lobes were excised, weighed, and each whole lobe was separately homogenised in 5 mL of PBS using a gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). Residual cells and connective tissue were removed by centrifugation at 1600 rpm. The remaining eight ferrets were sacrificed 14 days post-inoculation, cardiac bleeds were obtained for analysis by haemagglutination inhibition to the infecting virus. The infectious viral load of ferret lung lobes and nasal wash samples, which were determined by TCID50 titration assay, performed as outlined above.Real time RT-PCRViral RNA quantitation was performed each day of ferret nasal wash (prior to storage at −80 °C), and ferret lung lobe aliquots were also analysed by the SensiFast Probe Lo-ROX One-Step qRT-PCR System Kit (Bioline), as outlined in previous study44. Influenza A cycle threshold (Ct) value was analysed by the ABI 7500 Real Time PCR System (Thermo, Australia) under the following conditions; 45 °C for 10 min, one cycle; 95 °C for 2 min, one cycle; 95 °C for 5 s then 60 °C for 30 s, 45 cycles. The influenza A RNA primers detected the matrix gene using a forward (5'-GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC-3'), reverse (5'–GGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTACG–3'), and Taqman probe (5'–6FAM-TGCAGTCCTCGCTCACTGGGCACG-BHQ1–3') sourced from CDC Influenza Division (Atlanta, United States of America).Ferret airborne transmission model experimentsThe experimental procedure for the transmission study is shown in Supplementary Fig. 9, with three different inoculums; 100% WT, 100% double mutant or a 50:50 mixture of WT:double mutant (Supplementary Table 4). In brief, donor ferrets were infected via intranasal inoculation with influenza virus diluted to 5 log10TCID50/mL in 500 uL PBS (250 µL per nostril). After infection, all ferrets were monitored daily. The first group of naïve recipient ferrets (RF1s) were introduced into the donor-adjacent cage at 1 day post-inoculation, a double panel perforated metal sheet (two staggered panels are 25.4 mm apart with holes of 5 mm in diameter and spaced 3 mm apart) and one-directional circular airflow was used for airborne transmission studies, this cage design does not distinguish between airborne droplet and aerosol virus transmission5. At day 2 post-exposure to the donor animals, nasal washes from RF1 animals were collected and immediately analysed for viral RNA by qPCR. A Ct value of less than 30 indicated a ferret was influenza virus positive and RF1 was subsequently moved to a new cage adjacent to RF2, where both animals stayed for the remainder of the trial. All animals were sacrificed at day 14 post-PCR positive and cardiac bleeds were taken for serology analysis prior to euthanasia.PyrosequencingViral RNA was extracted, as above, from ferret nasal washes on the day of sample processing and stored at −80 °C. RT-PCR amplification of PA-38 and NA-275 gene regions was performed using biotin-tagged primers (Supplementary Table 5) and the MyTaq One-Step RT-PCR kit (Bioline, Australia). The pyrosequencing analysis was performed on amplified cDNA with sequencing primers (also described in Supplementary Table 5) and the PyroMarkQ96ID system (Qiagen). Sequence analysis revealed the relative proportion of wild type and SNPs at position PA-38 and NA-275, as previously outlined68.Statistics and reproducibilityAll statistically analysis performed throughout was named with the statistical test used with information about the exact sample size (>3), any assumptions or corrections, and the resulting p-value of the null-hypothesis tests. Standard deviation was used to capture error from the mean.

This year's flu season may strike earlier and harder than usual, experts warn. A flu shot's your best protection. Scott Olson/ Getty Images After virtually disappearing for two years in the U.S. as the COVID-19 pandemic shut down society, there are hints the flu could reemerge this fall, potentially causing an unusually early and possibly severe flu season. As a result, many experts are urging people to get their flu shots right away to make sure they're protected. But is that the best timing? It depends on which expert you talk to and, maybe, on your age and particular situation. "It's time to get your flu shot right now," advises Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University. Sponsor Message "People should get them now," agrees Shaun Truelove, an assistant scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who's helping lead a new effort to project this year's flu season for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The usual flu season starts in November in the U.S. and peaks in January or February. "In normal years, it makes sense to hold off on the flu shot until late fall, as protection really doesn't last more than a few months and late fall/winter is when the flu wave usually hits here," says Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona College of Medicine. "So in a normal year, I would probably try to wait until mid-October and get the flu shot then," he says. But this year, he says, "flu cases are already starting to go up, so it makes sense to get it sooner — i.e., now." Why flu could come back strong this year The reason experts are particularly concerned about the flu this year is that many people, especially very young children, may have little or no immunity against the respiratory infection because the masking, social distancing and other behaviors aimed at protecting against COVID have blunted flu's spread, too. Also, the CDC notes, young children would do well to get a flu shot soon because they require two shots one month apart, and it takes time to build up immunity. Sponsor Message Because the protection that flu vaccination provides to the elderly tends to wane faster than for other adults, many experts recommend against that group getting vaccinated too early — but one now is fine. "For the elderly, I would not recommend vaccination until September at the earliest, since immunity can wane. I tend to get my vaccination in October," says Dr. Walter Orenstein, a vaccine specialist at Emory University who previously worked at the CDC. Warning signs from Australia There's another reason for many other adults to get a flu shot sooner than later: The flu season hit early and hard in some countries in the Southern Hemisphere (such as Australia) this past winter. And what happens during the winter south of the equator often foreshadows that will happen in the Northern Hemisphere. "So getting the vaccine earlier is definitely a good idea," Truelove says. Shots - Health News Here are the key reasons to get a flu shot — now Still, some experts say they're planning to wait several weeks yet to get their own shot. "I'll get mine sometime in November," says John Moore, an immunologist at Weil Cornell Medicine. "Protection by flu vaccines is usually weak and short-lived," he notes, "so getting vaccinated too early provides too little protection when the virus is actually circulating. And that's not now. We are not in 'flu season' yet." Others say adults might reasonably wait until it seems like cases in their region are increasing. "I'd say it's best to keep eyes on what flu activity is like in your area," says Jeremy Kamil, an immunologist at Louisiana State University. "Ideally, we'd want to match our boosting to afford us optimum levels of immunity when the virus is actually on the rise." Just don't wait too long. Because the flu often starts to hit hard right when people are traveling and gathering for Thanksgiving, the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases encourages people to "make sure they're vaccinated by Halloween," says Patsy Stinchfield, the foundation's president. "It takes about two or three weeks for antibodies to rise high enough to be protective." Shots - Health News Flu is expected to flare up in U.S. this winter, raising fears of a 'twindemic' In the end, the precise timing of when you get a flu shot over the next month or so doesn't matter as much as that you get one, flu experts agree, especially this year. Truelove's group estimates that, in the worst case scenario, the flu could hospitalize as many as 560,000 people in the U.S. this year — and kill as many as 63,000.

Early indicators have state public health officials bracing for what could be a significant influenza season. As Edward O’Brien reports, Montanans are urged to get the flu shot as soon as possible.Australia is emerging from its worst influenza season in five years. Flu season there arrived earlier and hit harder than normal. The southern hemisphere’s flu trends can sometimes be a harbinger of what the United States may face.Montana Health Department influenza epidemiologist, Devon Cozart, says public health officials are bracing for the possibility of a severe flu season this fall and winter.“This is especially true when you do consider the last two flu seasons we had here in Montana where activity was very minimal compared to previous seasons. We may be more susceptible this season to influenza infection, especially in young children whose immune systems may not have strong immunity to the flu virus yet.”Health Department Immunization Section Supervisor Trisha Gardner is urging Montanans to get their flu shot in the coming weeks.“The recommendation is really September, October to receive those vaccines – particularly by the end of October to get those in your system would be ideal.”But Gardner adds if you can’t make that deadline, a little late is far better than no flu vaccine at all. She says it’s perfectly safe to simultaneously get the new COVID-19 Omicron bivalent booster and the flu shot.Health officials say frequent hand washing, covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, avoiding touching the face with unwashed hands and staying away from work when sick, also helps prevent the spread of illness.

Amid travel restrictions, quarantines, closures, physical distancing, masking, enhanced hand washing, and disinfection, the 2020-2021 flu season was all but canceled. That meant not just an unprecedented global decrease in the number of people sick with the flu but also a dramatic collapse in the genetic diversity of circulating flu strains. Many subtypes of the virus all but vanished. But most notably, one entire lineage—one of only four flu groups targeted by seasonal influenza vaccines—went completely dark, seemingly extinct. Researchers noted the absence last year as the flu was still struggling to recover from its pandemic knockout. But now, the flu has come roaring back and threatens to cause a particularly nasty season in the Northern Hemisphere. Still, the influenza B/Yamagata lineage remains missing, according to a study published this week in the journal Eurosurveillance. It has not been definitively detected since April 2020. And the question of whether it has truly gone extinct lingers. What B/Yamagata's absence might mean for future flu seasons and flu shots also remains an open question. For a quick refresher: Four main types of seasonal flu have been circulating globally among humans in recent years. Two are influenza type A viruses: subtypes of H1N1 viruses and H3N2 viruses. The other two are influenza type B viruses: offshoots of the Victoria and Yamagata lineages. (For a more detailed explanation of influenza, check out our explainer here.) Current quadrivalent vaccines target season-specific versions of each of these four types of flu viruses. Having fewer flu viruses around means it could be easier to match future vaccines to circulating viruses, making seasonal shots more effective. On the other hand, a surprise re-emergence of B/Yamagata could become more dangerous as time passes and people lose immunity. But, before health experts can game out future influenza seasons, they'd like to know if B/Yamagata is truly gone. Vanished virus In an article published this week in the journal Eurosurveillance, researchers in the Netherlands sifted through the latest global influenza surveillance data up to August 31, 2022, looking for the missing strain. They note that GISAID, a global database of influenza virus genetic sequences that typically gets thousands of flu sequences each year, has not received a single B/Yamagata sequence with specimen collection data after March 2020. The World Health Organization's FluNet surveillance data has had a small number of reports of the missing lineage—43 in 2021, mostly from China, and eight sporadic cases from four countries in 2022. For comparison, there were more than 51,000 detections of B/Yamagata in 2018. The authors suggest the small number of cases in the last two years may be erroneous detections. Rather than circulating viruses, they may simply be detecting signatures of B/Yamagata from vaccines that carry live-attenuated influenza viruses. Or, they could be genetic contamination from inactivated-virus vaccines. This isn't just a hypothetical. The authors note that a number of B/Yamagata detections in the US and Scotland were found to be from live-attenuated influenza vaccines rather than real cases of circulating virus. The researchers call for flu surveillance laboratories to increase efforts to detect any Yamagata cases to determine if it's truly gone or just lying low. "From a laboratory perspective, we think it would be advisable to increase the capability and capacity to determine the lineage of all detected influenza B viruses around the world as this is critical to determine the absence of B/Yamagata lineage viruses," they conclude. They also propose that the World Health Organization set up criteria to define when the lineage could be declared "extinct" and what the consequences of that declaration might be.

In this week’s edition of Ask Prognosis, a reader wonders whether it’s OK to double up on the flu shots this season. But before we get to that ...If you get a flu shot in early September, can you get a second one later in the season? Joan, Port Chester, New YorkThis inclination makes total sense to me. After reaching the fourth dose of Covid vaccines, we’re all hyper-aware that their potency can eventually wane. And the flu is terrible. No one wants the flu! So why not get your flu shot early in the season, and then top it off a bit later? While there’s no danger in getting two flu shots, it’s probably unnecessary, according to Katrine Wallace, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago.“For adults whose immune systems have encountered both the flu vaccine and the flu virus, studies have not shown a benefit to receiving a second flu shot, even in elderly people with less robust immune systems,” Wallace says. “One influenza vaccination per year is enough for the majority of the population.” (The rules are different for kids, she says. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that kids under 9 who have never had a flu shot get two shots for their first vaccination.)The efficacy of the flu shot, however, does fade. The flu virus mutates rapidly — much more rapidly than Covid — making the shot you got last year less effective against this season’s version. Both of these factors mean it’s important to boost your immune system with a new dose of the flu shot each year. Have a confidential tip for our reporters?

Advanced Search Home News Releases Multimedia Meetings Login Register News Release 29-Sep-2022 New drug has potential to turn COVID-19 virus against itself Scripps Research team showed that a variation of an already FDA-approved therapeutic for neurological disease can block COVID-19 infection in animals Peer-Reviewed Publication Scripps Research Institute image: A drug developed by Scripps Research scientists prevents SARS-CoV-2 (blue) from binding to ACE2 receptors (pink) to infect human cells. The drug latches on to the virus and then adds a “nitro group” similar to nitroglycerin to ACE2 whenever the drug-coated virus approaches the receptor. view more Credit: Scripps Research LA JOLLA, CA—A new drug designed by scientists at Scripps Research can turn the COVID-19 virus into a harbinger of its own doom. The drug, NMT5, described in Nature Chemical Biology on September 29, 2022, coats SARS-CoV-2 with chemicals that can temporarily alter the human ACE2 receptor—the molecule the virus normally latches onto to infect cells. That means that when the virus is near, its path into human cells via the ACE2 receptor is blocked; in the absence of the virus, however, ACE2 can function as usual. “What’s so neat about this drug is that we’re actually turning the virus against itself,” says senior author Stuart Lipton, MD, PhD, the Step Family Endowed Chair and Scripps Research professor. “We’re arming it with little molecular warheads that end up preventing it from infecting our cells; it’s our revenge on the virus.” Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Lipton and his colleagues had long been studying variations of the drug memantine, which Lipton developed and patented in the 1990s for treating neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s. While memantine originated from an anti-influenza drug used in the 1960s, clinicians began investigating it for additional diseases after they noticed a woman with Parkinson’s symptoms improved when she took the drug for the flu. “My team had made these antiviral drugs better for the brain, and when COVID-19 emerged, we wondered whether we had also, in the process, made any of them better antivirals,” says Lipton. Lipton and his team tested a library of compounds similar to memantine in overall structure but covered with additional pharmacological warheads. They pinpointed the drug candidate designated NMT5 as having two key properties: It could recognize and attach to a pore on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, and it could chemically modify human ACE2 using a fragment of nitroglycerin as the warhead. The group realized this could turn the virus into a delivery vehicle for its own demise. In the new paper, Lipton’s group characterized and tested NMT5 in isolated cells as well as animals. They showed how NMT5 attaches tightly to SARS-CoV-2 viral particles as the viruses move through the body. Then, they revealed the details of how the drug adds a chemical (similar to nitroglycerin) to certain molecules if it gets close enough. When the virus gets near ACE2 to infect a cell, that translates into NMT5 adding a “nitro group” to the receptor. When ACE2 is modified in this way, its structure temporarily shifts – for about 12 hours – so that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can no longer bind to it to cause infection. “What’s really beautiful is that this only knocks down availability of ACE2 locally when the virus is coming at it,” says Lipton. “It doesn’t knock down all the function of ACE2 elsewhere in the body, allowing for normal function of this protein.” In cell culture experiments testing how well the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 can attach to human ACE2 receptors, the drug prevented 95% of viral binding. In hamsters with COVID-19, NMT5 decreased virus levels by 100-fold, eliminated blood vessel damage in the animals’ lungs, and ameliorated inflammation. The drug also showed effectiveness against nearly a dozen other variants of COVID-19, including alpha, beta, gamma and delta strains. Most anti-viral drugs work by directly blocking part of a virus—which can pressure the virus to evolve resistance to the drug. Since NMT5 is only using the virus as a carrier, the researchers think the drug is likely to be effective against many other variants of SARS-CoV-2. “We expect this compound would continue to be effective even as new variants emerge, because it doesn’t rely on attacking parts of the virus that commonly mutate,” says Chang-ki Oh, a senior staff scientist and first author of the new paper. Though they have only studied the compound in animal models, the team is now making a version of the drug to evaluate for human use, while carrying out additional safety and effectiveness trials in animals. This work is being sponsored by the Scripps Center Grant for Antiviral Medicines & Pandemic Preparedness (CAMPP AViDD) from the National Institutes of Health (U19 AI171443). “These exciting findings suggest a new avenue for drug development that requires drug combinations for effective pandemic preparedness,” says co-author Arnab Chatterjee, PhD.

However, predicting mutational effects remains challenging because of epistasis—the nonadditive interactions between mutations. Here, we investigate the biophysical mechanism of strain-specific epistasis in the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A viruses (IAVs). We integrate structural, kinetic, thermodynamic, and conformational dynamics analyses of four NS1s of influenza strains that emerged between 1918 and 2004. Although functionally near-neutral, strain-specific NS1 mutations exhibit long-range epistatic interactions with residues at the p85β-binding interface. We reveal that strain-specific mutations reshaped the NS1 energy landscape during evolution. Using NMR spin dynamics, we find that the strain-specific mutations altered the conformational dynamics of the hidden network of tightly packed residues, underlying the evolution of long-range epistasis. This work shows how near-neutral mutations silently alter the biophysical energy landscapes, resulting in diverse background effects during molecular evolution.

However, nonadditive interactions between mutations make comprehensive mapping of this sequence-function space extremely difficult to achieve, if not impossible2.For example, the effects of two single mutations at sites a and b, denoted as ΔGa and ΔGb, respectively, can cause the double mutant of the two sites to show either additive (ΔΔGa,b = ΔGa + ΔGb) or nonadditive behaviors (ΔΔGa,b ≠ ΔGa + ΔGb)3. Epistasis refers to the nonadditive effect between two mutations. Various patterns of epistatic interactions are possible, and the same mutation can result in different outcomes in different backgrounds3,4. Epistasis also allows neutral or near-neutral mutations to have an evolutionary impact by diversifying genetic backgrounds, which might serve as a pre-adapted platform in the new environment5,6,7. Alternatively, these mutations may have permissive roles in which subsequent mutations would otherwise be deleterious8,9.Although many studies on epistasis have focused on the mutational effects on the functional landscape, mapping the mutational effect on the energy landscape is critical for understanding the mechanistic basis of epistasis10,11. In particular, because neutral mutations are functionally silent on their own, deep mechanistic studies on how they alter biophysical traits of a protein are essential6,8.From the physical perspective, epistasis can be classified as a short- or long-range mutational effect. While a short-range epistatic interaction between directly contacting residues is structurally intuitive, the mechanistic basis of long-range epistatic interactions between spatially distant residues requires further refinement, although some interesting mechanisms are available12,13,14,15. Moreover, epistatic effects of neutral mutations often occur through long-range interactions8,16. Thus, the biophysical foundation of long-range epistasis can help understand how neutral mutations contribute to protein evolution9.In this study, we trace evolutionary changes in the in vitro functional and biophysical traits of nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A viruses (IAV). To this end, we selected four NS1s of human IAV strains that emerged between 1918 and 2004: 1918 H1N1, Puerto Rico 8 (PR8) H1N1, Udorn (Ud) H3N2, and Vietnam (VN) H5N1.NS1 of an influenza virus is a multifunctional virulence factor that antagonizes the host’s innate immune response and is associated with many strain-specific functions in viral replication and host range17,18. Moreover, NS1 is one of the most frequently mutated19 and mutation-tolerant proteins20 in the IAV genome. Multiple strain-specific mutations in NS1 were identified as adaptive mutations with respect to viral virulence and replication21,22; however, many remain uncharacterized, mainly because of the lack of functional phenotypes. Especially, many mutations occur in the effector domain (ED) of NS1 that interacts with a number of host factors, including retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), during the infection cycle23,24,25,26.Outlining the present study, we first present that strain-specific mutations in NS1 EDs have near-neutral effects on the association kinetics to the p85β subunit of PI3K. We subsequently find that near-neutral, strain-specific mutations have long-range epistatic interactions with the residues on the p85β-binding interface of NS1. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we then find that strain-specific mutations altered the thermodynamic energy landscape of the NS1:p85β interaction. To further address how strain-specific mutations altered the energy landscape of NS1s and enabled long-range epistasis during evolution, we conducted extensive biophysical analyses of NS1s. Structural analyses revealed conformational variations occurred during NS1 evolution. Especially, using NMR spin dynamics of backbones and side-chains, we reveal how strain-specific mutations influence long-range epistasis through dynamic reorganization of packing interactions in the hydrophobic core. Consequently, our study provides a high-resolution mechanism by which neutral mutations contribute to protein evolution by reshaping the energy landscape, despite the absence of functional changes.ResultsStrain-specific epistasis in NS1The four NS1 EDs (referred to as NS1s) employed in this study contain 3–14 % of residues that are strain-specifically mutated in the protein sequence with respect to the 1918 NS1 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Many of the mutations are conservative between similar types of amino acids located at buried or partially buried sites in the NS1 structure; the average relative solvent accessible surface area of mutated residues was 32.2% (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1b).Fig. 1: Strain-specific mutations of NS1s.a The sequence logo of four NS1s.

Compared to the 1918 NS1, other NS1s dissociated from p85β with a smaller dissociation rate constant, resulting in a moderately higher binding affinity to p85β (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figs. 2b–e).However, there was no difference in the binding among the later strains of 1918 IAV; namely, PR8, Ud, and VN NS1s shared virtually identical binding (kon) and unbinding (koff) rate constants (Fig. 1c). Notably, the kon value was highly similar in all four NS1s, including 1918 NS1, showing that strain-specific mutations across the NS1s have a near-neutral effect on the p85β-binding rate constant. These results also suggest that kon is a biophysical constraint of NS1 evolution27,28.We further tested whether the energetic contribution of the individual p85β-binding residues to kon is conserved across different NS1 backgrounds (Supplementary Fig. 3). The p85β-binding interface on NS1 consists of 20 residues based on the crystal structure of the complex23,29, while our previous study identified residues 89, 95, 98, 145, and 146 of NS1 as the major players determining the p85β-binding rate constant29; thus, these residues are referred to as core interface residues (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2: Strain-specific epistasis in NS1s.a The core and rim interface residues are shown as cyan sticks and wheat spheres, respectively. b Definition of ΔGon (WT–MT) in the binding reaction coordinate between NS1 and p85β.

Error bars represent the propagated standard deviation of three repeated measurements of kon values. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageUsing Ala-scanning mutagenesis30, we measured the extent to which individual core interface residues contribute to the p85β-binding rate constant in the four NS1 backgrounds. For Y89, however, we incorporated F89 instead of A89 because the Y89A mutation reduced binding too much to quantify the effect. We first calculated ΔGon (WT–MT) of the individual mutants with respect to their wild-type constructs (Fig. 2b); a larger negative number means a larger deleterious effect of a mutation. Notably, individual core interface residues have substantially different binding energetics in different NS1 backgrounds (Fig. 2c). Next, to follow the evolutionary trajectory of the binding energetics at the residue level, we plotted the ΔGon of the core interface residues along with the year of occurrence of IAV strains (Fig. 2d). Overall, the energetic contribution of core residues decreased from 1918 to 1972 (Ud) and then increased in 2004 (VN).These background-dependent mutational effects suggest that the core binding residues are energetically coupled with strain-specific mutations of NS1, i.e., epistatic interactions. So, we measured the epistatic interactions using a thermodynamic cycle analysis (Fig. 2e–g and Supplementary Fig. 4). Note that we considered a different NS1 background as a single mutant, although multiple mutations are involved in different NS1s. Thus, energetic coupling (i.e., epistasis) in our study represents the interaction between mutations of individual core interface residues and the collection of strain-specific residues. Following the standard notation for epistasis4, here, we define that additive and negative epistasis corresponds to less (i.e., larger kon values) and more (i.e., smaller kon values) deleterious effects, respectively, by a double mutation than the sum of two single mutational effects. Sign epistasis means that the effect of a double mutation is beneficial with respect to one type of single mutation background and deleterious with respect to another single mutation background.Indeed, we observed various types of epistasis, including additive, negative, and sign epistasis Supplementary Fig. 4). Moreover, the same residue exhibited different types of epistasis depending on the choice of NS1 background. For example, Y89F showed sign epistasis between the 1918 and PR8 NS1 backgrounds but negative epistasis between Ud and VN NS1 backgrounds (Fig. 2e–g).Then, to examine the evolutionary trajectory of epistasis, we calculated how the epistatic interaction evolved in different NS1s relative to the 1918 NS1 (Supplementary Fig. 5). This trajectory is equivalent to cumulative epistatic interactions starting in 1918. Overall, core interface residues showed positive epistatic interactions with strain-specific mutations between 1918 and 1972, indicating that the binding interface mutations have less deleterious effects on kon values of NS1s of later IAV strains. This trend reversed between 1972 and 2004, with large negative epistasis. As a result, overall epistatic interactions seemed to fluctuate around null epistasis. This outcome indicates that strain-specific mutations have near-neutral effects on the overall association kinetics, while they altered the energetic contribution of individual residues during NS1 evolution. Structurally, however, the majority of strain-specific mutations are located remotely from the p85β-binding interface, indicating long-range epistasis (Fig. 1b).Strain-specific mutations reshaped the energy landscape of NS1Long-range epistasis—energetic coupling between distant residues—suggests that strain-specific mutations altered the protein energy landscape3,4. The protein energy landscape can be probed by examining biophysical properties such as binding thermodynamics31. Thus, we characterized the thermodynamic signature for the binding of NS1s to p85β using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Here, changes in binding thermodynamic signature across NS1s represent the evolution of the binding energy landscape accompanying changes in enthalpic (ΔH) and entropic (TΔS) properties.Overall, binding was driven by favorable enthalpy and entropy changes (Fig. 3a and b). However, Ud NS1 showed a striking difference from other NS1s in that the binding was not accompanied by measurable heat; that is, the binding was driven exclusively by a favorable entropy change (Fig. 3a, b). Although minor compared to Ud NS1, other NS1s also showed sizable variations in thermodynamic signature, indicating strain-specific variations in the binding energy landscape.Fig. 3: Effects of strain-specific mutations of NS1s on the thermodynamic signature for binding to p85β.a ITC thermograms and binding isotherms for the interaction between NS1s and p85β. Red lines represent fit curves using 1:1 binding stoichiometry. b Estimated thermodynamic parameters for binding between NS1s and p85β. Uncertainties represent the standard deviation of three repeated measurements. N.D. represents not detected because of the absence of heat in the binding reaction. c Surface representation of NS1. Core interface residues are shown as sticks. Residues 95 and 98 of 1918 and Ud NS1s are shown in cyan and magenta, respectively. d The structure of p85β bound to NS1 is shown to illustrate the interaction with the core interface residues.Full size imageThis result is surprising because the protein sequence of the p85β-binding interface is almost completely conserved across the NS1s. The only difference is that Ud NS1 contains mutations at two of the 20 interface residues compared to the other three NS1s. However, these mutations are isosteric: L to I and M to L for residues 95 and 98, respectively (Fig. 3c, d). Moreover, grafting the Ud sequence to 1918 NS1 did not affect its binding to p85β23.To further confirm that the two mutations are not responsible for the drastic change in the thermodynamic signature, we incorporated I95L/L98M mutations into Ud NS1; i.e., this mutant contains the same sequence in the binding interface as other NS1s. ITC data showed that the binding of Ud-I95L/L98M to p85β is not accompanied by heat as in wild-type Ud NS1 (Fig. 3a, b). We also tested the effect of grafting the Ud sequence to the PR8 background (i.e., PR8 L95I/M98L) and found no significant change in the thermodynamic signature for binding to p85β compared to that of wild-type PR8 NS1 (Fig. 3a, b). These results demonstrated that the direct binding interface is not responsible for the variation in the thermodynamic signature for binding. Instead, our results suggested that strain-specific mutations reshaped the energy landscape of NS1 via long-range interactions, resulting in strain-dependent thermodynamic signatures for binding to p85β. However, its underlying mechanism remains to be determined. In particular, future studies on the NS1-p85β complex are warranted to reveal the mechanism.These results are reminiscent of the recent finding that proteins explore diverse thermodynamic mechanisms by neutral or selective mutations during adaption to high temperatures, referred to as thermodynamic systems drift32. Thus, our results support the notion that proteins can acquire the same functional phenotype using completely different biophysical mechanisms32,33,34.NS1s have the same structures in the complexes with p85βTo reveal the mechanistic bases of long-range epistasis and how strain-specific mutations reshaped the energy landscape of NS1 during evolution, we first examined the structure of the NS1:p85β complexes. Noticeable changes in the complex structures could be a plausible explanation for the strain-specific epistasis and variation in the thermodynamic signature. The structure of the NS1:p85β complex was available for 1918 and PR8 NS1s23,35, and we determined a new crystal structure of VN NS1 bound to p85β in this study (Supplementary Table 1).Interestingly, the conformations of NS1s in the complexes were almost identical, with RMSD < 0.5 Å (Fig. 4a, b). Although the complex structure of Ud NS1 is not available, it is reasonable to assume that it has a structure similar to other NS1s, considering the sequence identity in the binding interface. This result indicated that the complex structure is not responsible for strain-specific mutational effects on NS1.Fig. 4: Conformational energy landscape of NS1.a RMSD (n = 4) of backbone Cartesian coordinates of NS1s.

Exchanging rate constants (kex) and population of BI conformers were determined by NMR CPMG RD (see Supplementary Fig. 7). N.D. not detected.Full size imageGiven the structural invariance of the complexes, we hypothesized that the structure and dynamics of NS1 in the unbound state are most likely responsible for the strain-specific epistasis and thermodynamic signature for binding. The following observations further support this hypothesis. The observed epistasis represents the change in the free-energy difference between the unbound and transition states (Fig. 2b), and the ITC result corresponds to the free-energy difference between the unbound and bound states. Therefore, both results are directly related to the structure and dynamics of free NS1.Conformational energy landscape of free NS1To study the evolutionary influence on the conformation of free NS1, we first compared all the crystal structures of free NS1s (n = 16) of the four IAV strains available in PDB. The structural alignment showed substantial conformational heterogeneity among free NS1s (Fig. 4a, c). Previously, we showed that 1918 NS1 populates two conformations23: p85β binding-competent (BC) and -incompetent (BI) conformers (Fig. 4d). Indeed, hierarchical cluster analysis showed that all 16 crystal structures could be clustered into either BI-like or BC-like conformations (Fig. 4e).However, which of the BI and BC states represents the major conformer in the solution remained uncertain. To identify the major conformer of free NS1s, we compared NMR NOESY cross-peaks specific to either BI-like or BC-like conformers. Based on the NOESY cross-peaks pattern, we concluded that the free NS1s of the four IAV strains populate the BC-like conformer as the major species (Supplementary Fig. 6).Considering the presence of the two groups of crystal structures, it is likely that the BC state of NS1 undergoes conformational exchange with the BI state. We further characterized the BI-BC conformational dynamics using the NMR 15N CPMG relaxation dispersion36,37,38. Indeed, PR8 and VN NS1s underwent the BI-BC dynamics on a sub-ms timescale (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 7). Our previous study showed that 1918 NS1 also undergoes the BI-BC conformational dynamics on a similar timescale23. The analysis of slow-exchanging residues on the NMR timescale revealed that the population of the BC-like conformer was ~99% for PR8 and VN NS1s and ~90% for 1918 NS1 (Supplementary Fig. 7).On the contrary, Ud NS1 was static and only populated the BC conformer (>99%) (Fig. 4f)23, which is consistent with the fact that all available Ud NS1 structures showed only a BC-like conformer. Although Ud NS1 could be dynamic in different timescales that are not detectable by NMR CPMG-RD, it was obvious that strain-specific mutations reshaped the energy landscape of free NS1s, as evidenced by altered conformational dynamics (Fig. 4f).Given that the epistatic interactions were probed based on the mutational effects on binding rate constants, we expected that the energy landscapes of the BC state differ strain-specifically; the BC conformer is the major species and responsible for binding to p85β. Therefore, we examined the conformational variations in the BC state between NS1s.To this end, we compared NMR chemical shifts (CS) of the backbone amide (1H and 15N), 13Cα and 13Cβ resonances in four NS1s (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 8). The root-mean-square deviation of chemical shift (RMSD-CS) among the NS1s reports the evolutionary variation in the conformation of the BC state. In other words, conformational fluctuations of NS1 during evolution can be mapped in a site-specific manner using RMSD-CS. Residues with an RMSD-CS larger than the third quartile Q3 were identified as structurally variable residues across NS1s (Fig. 5a, b). Here, we excluded strain-specific mutations from the calculation of Q3; note that the inclusion of mutated residues altered the selection of only five residues and did not affect our analysis.Fig. 5: Conformational variation across NS1s.a RMSD-CS of backbone amides (15NH) resonances of NS1s (n = 3 or 4).

Orange arrows show positions of core interface residues. b Residues whose RMSD-CS (15NH) > Q3 are shown as light blue spheres. Core interface residues are shown as orange sticks. c Strain-specific mutation sites are shown as spheres. Mutations in the hydrophobic core are shown in blue spheres. d RMSD-CS of methyl (13CH3) resonances of NS1s. Note that x-axis represents approximate residue number due to space limitation. The same plot with explicit residue numbers is shown in Supplementary Fig. 10. a, d Source data are provided as a Source data file. e Residues whose RMSD-CS (13CH3) > Q3 are shown as purple spheres. The β-sheet shared by the hydrophobic core and p85-binding surface is shown in cyan. f Conformationally variable methyl-containing side-chains and β6-α2 loop are shown in magenta and blue spheres, respectively, in the complex with p85β (PDB ID: 6U28).Full size imageMany of the identified residues are spatially close to the mutation sites (Fig. 5a–c), indicating that the chemical shift changes represent mutational effects on the conformation of nearby residues. Moreover, the rim interface showed conformational variation across NS1s; for example, several residues in the β6-α2 loop in the rim interface showed conformational variation (Fig. 5b). This result is also consistent with the crystallographic analysis of BC conformers (Fig. 4a; blue line).To further examine the side-chain conformational changes, we compared RMSD-CS of side-chain methyl resonances (1H and 13C) of Ile, Leu, Val, Thr, Met, and Ala (ILVTMA) in four NS1s (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10, and Supplementary Tables 2–5). Notably, all conformationally variable side-chains (i.e., RMSD-CS > Q3) clustered in the hydrophobic core (Fig. 5e). The hydrophobic core is spatially located on the opposite side of the β-sheet harboring core p85β-binding residues (Fig. 5e, f). Moreover, the hydrophobic core contains multiple strain-specific mutation sites (Fig. 5c). This result indicates that the hydrophobic core might play a key role in transmitting mutational effects to the p85β-binding interface through a long-distance network of physical contacts. Notably, none of the core interface residues showed considerable conformational variation across NS1s, while the hydrophobic core and rim interface (i.e., β6-α2 loop) were sensitive to strain-specific mutations (Fig. 5f).Strain-specific mutations altered the structural dynamics of the hydrophobic core of NS1The conformational variations in the hydrophobic core and rim interface across NS1s can result from diverse biophysical mechanisms32,34. Thus, we further examined the mechanistic basis of the long-range mutational effects on the rim interface.We first tested whether the evolutionary conformational variation of NS1 is the result of changes in the overall protein stability. Long-range epistasis can be mediated by differential mutational effects on protein stability4,11,39,40. We measured the protein stability of NS1s using H/D-exchange coupled with NMR and the thermal shift analysis. Intriguingly, all four NS1s showed similar global protein stability (Supplementary Fig. 11), indicating that the long-range epistasis is not due to the differential stability of NS1s. These results also suggest that the stability of NS1s was already optimized during natural evolution.Protein motion is another commonly postulated mechanism of epistatic interactions14,15,41; however, there is a paucity of direct experimental evidence. To test the role of protein motion in long-range epistasis, we hypothesized that mutations affected the rim interface by altering the flexibility of hydrophobic core residues of NS1. However, it should be noted that our hypothesis does not assume a contiguous pathway between a mutational site to the rim interface. Instead, we expected that the flexibility of individual residues changes differently depending on the position and nature of the mutations. For example, a comparison between strain-1 and strain-3 (Fig. 6) can show the long-range interaction between residues A and F. However, this comparison does not reveal other hidden relationships between residues E and F, for which strain-1 and strain-2 need to be compared. Moreover, the same residue may become more flexible in one NS1 but more rigid in another (Fig. 6). Taken together, studying the residue-specific flexibility within a specific NS1 might be insufficient to identify all the residues responsible for long-range epistasis.Fig. 6: Statistical view of long-range epistasis.Interactions between residues A and F may not be detectable in individual NS1s, as strain-specific mutations (denoted by a, b, and c) differently perturb the flexibility of individual residues. However, residues with large changes in flexibility (red balls) during evolution can be identified by comparing the standard deviation of flexibility among NS1s. The identified residues might collectively form a network in the hydrophobic core and rim interface when they are projected onto the NS1 structure. Our hypothesis suggests that the networked residues interact with each other through direct or indirect contact during NS1 evolution.Full size imageHowever, a large statistical variation in the residue-specific flexibility among NS1s indicates that the residue underwent significant changes in flexibility during NS1 evolution. Therefore, we can accept the hypothesis if the residues with a large statistical variation in flexibility are clustered in the hydrophobic core and rim interface (Fig. 6).To characterize mutational effects on the flexibility of individual residues of NS1s, we measured the NMR order parameter (S2) of the backbone amide bonds (1H-15N)42. Generally, NMR S2 characterizes the energy landscape shaped by the conformational flexibility of individual chemical bonds. Here, S2 probes the energy landscape basin corresponding to the BC-like conformer because it populates 90–99% of the entire population (Fig. 7a). For comparison, the NMR CPMG-RD probed the energy landscape shaped by conformational exchange in the slower (typically μs – ms) timescale (Fig. 7a).Fig. 7: Variation in conformational dynamics during NS1 evolution.a Schematic showing the energy landscape mapping by NMR CPMG-RD and S2 analyses. b Standard deviation (SD) of backbone S2NH values acquired for four NS1s.

The same plot with explicit residue number is presented in Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15. e NS1 structure with residues whose SD-S2axis > Q3 are shown as tan spheres. Methyl groups examined by NMR are shown in purple. β-sheet of NS1 is shown in cyan. f All dynamically variable residues are shown as spheres. Residues with SD-S2NH > Q3 and SD-S2axis > Q3 are shown in light blue and purple, respectively. Residues whose backbone and side-chain are both dynamically variable are shown in orange. g All dynamically variable residues are shown in spheres. Residue 171 is shown in green. Rim interface residues that are dynamically variable are shown in slate blue with residue numbers in purple. Core binding residues are shown in orange sticks. Source data are provided as a Source data file.Full size imageResidues with a large standard deviation of S2 values (i.e., SD-S2 > Q3) across NS1s were identified as dynamically variable residues; that is, the conformational flexibility of these residues fluctuated widely during the evolution of NS1 (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 12). Overall, the backbone amide order parameter (S2NH) analysis largely recapitulated the mutational effects on the structure: the core interface residues only showed slight variation in S2NH across NS1s, whereas residues with a large SD-S2NH were mainly in the hydrophobic core and rim interface (Fig. 7c). Noticeably, the dynamically variable residues are mainly located at or near the mutational sites and are mainly in the well-folded secondary structures, not in the flexible loops (Fig. 7c). This result suggests that the observed variation in dynamics reflects the bona fide mutational effects and not the variation of intrinsically flexible regions by subtle changes in experimental conditions. Thus, site-specific conformational dynamics most likely varied along with the evolution of NS1.Interestingly, three hydrophobic core residues with a dynamically variable backbone also showed conformational variations in the side-chain based on methyl chemical shift changes (Supplementary Fig. 13). Generally, however, backbone and side-chain dynamics do not necessarily correlate, especially for residues with a long side-chain43. So, we hypothesized that the high packing density in the hydrophobic core enabled the facile propagation of mutational effects to a longer range, and as a result, both backbone and side-chain dynamics probe mutational effects in a complementary manner.To test the idea, we examined side-chain dynamics by measuring the methyl axis S2 values based on deuterium relaxation rates in the 13CH2D moiety of the ILVTMA residues44 (Supplementary Fig. 14 and 15). The dynamically variable side-chains across NS1s (SD-S2axis > Q3) clustered closely in the hydrophobic core; in contrast, none of the core interface residues were dynamically variable across NS1s (Fig. 7d, e). Moreover, dynamically variable side-chains are near the residues whose backbone is dynamically variable among NS1s (Fig. 7f and Supplementary Fig. 12). For some residues, both backbone and side-chain were dynamically variable. These dynamically variable residues directly contact each other (Fig. 7f).These observations support our hypothesis that a high packing density in the hydrophobic core enables the long-range relay of mutational effects. For example, residue 171 is the most frequently mutated position in NS1 of all human IAVs and directly contacts with residues whose side-chain or backbone showed dynamic variation during NS1 evolution (Fig. 7g). This example illustrates how strain-specific mutational effects are transmitted to the rim interface area. Although core residues make a significant energetic contribution to binding, rim residues also play a role in modulating the local environment around core residues45,46,47,48. Subsequently, it is likely that altered dynamics of the rim interface affect the sampling of productive conformations during the association process to p85β, resulting in strain-dependent epistasis. From the energy landscape perspective, strain-specific mutations altered the conformational energy landscape of NS1s by rearranging the packing interactions, as evidenced by the clustering of dynamically variable residues.These results demonstrate that near-neutral mutations can silently alter the energy landscape without noticeable changes in functional phenotypes. We speculate that the cumulative effects of near-neutral mutations on the molecular energy landscape help proteins explore new functions during evolution. Therefore, understanding how mutations reshape the biophysical landscape can offer a new mechanistic basis for protein evolution and function14,49.DiscussionThe evolutionary inference of our results should consider the following caveats. The strain-specific mutations in NS1s employed in the present study might not be neutral with respect to in vivo viral fitness. For example, although the interaction with p85β is highly conserved, NS1s showed some differences in their interactions with other host factors24,50. Thus, we cannot exclude that the mutations in NS1s could affect interactions with other host factors. Here, we cautiously define the “neutral mutation” as limited to the association kinetics to p85β, not concerning other cellular or in vivo functions.In the present study, we found long-range, strain-specific epistasis in the NS1s of human IAVs and sought to determine its mechanistic basis. Our structural study revealed that strain-specific mutations have limited impacts on the conformation of core p85β-binding residues. In contrast, the hydrophobic core and rim interface showed strain-specific conformational variations among free NS1s. Further studies revealed the hidden network of residues showing varied conformational dynamics during NS1 evolution. These networked residues structurally connect the mutational sites and the rim interface through the hydrophobic core. Therefore, our findings illustrate the high-resolution mechanism whereby a network of closely packed residues underlies long-range epistasis.Recent studies showed that epistasis is a pervasive phenomenon in protein evolution14,51. A tightly packed hydrophobic core is a common structural feature of well-folded proteins. We speculate that mutations altering the packing interactions might contribute to intramolecular epistatic interactions. Thus, our study provides mechanistic insights into why epistasis prevails. This result is also related to coupled conformational dynamics in the evolution of enzyme catalysis and protein allostery14,15,34,41,49,52,53.It is noteworthy that the network view of dynamically variable residues only emerges by the statistical measure of fluctuations in conformational (RMSD-CS) and dynamical (SD-S2) data across multiple NS1s (Fig. 6). This result indicates that the conformational or dynamic responses of individual residues in the network differ depending on the NS1 background. Indeed, this statistical picture aligns with the fluctuating pattern of long-range epistasis during NS1 evolution (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5); strain-specific mutations alter the pattern of epistasis because one mutation remodels the packing interaction differently from another.Our study also indicated that the molecular energy landscape of NS1s responds more sensitively to mutations during evolution than the functional landscape. For example, strain-specific mutations drastically alter the thermodynamic signature for binding to p85β in addition to affecting its structure and dynamics. Despite drastic changes in the molecular properties, the functional phenotype (i.e., association to p85β) did not change accordingly. This result is reminiscent of thermodynamic system drift, indicating that diverse biophysical mechanisms can result in the same phenotype during protein evolution33. Because of the diverse hosts and high zoonotic potential of IAVs, the NS1s employed in this study are the outcome of diverse evolutionary adaptations54. We conjecture that strain-specific mutations allowed NS1s to explore different evolutionary pathways, resulting in various molecular properties, while the key functionality is conserved. Our results highlight the need for integrated biophysical approaches to reveal the hidden molecular foundations of protein evolution.MethodsProtein sample preparationGenes encoding all NS1 EDs and p85β proteins were prepared by gene-synthesis service from Genscript: 1918 NS1 (residues 80–205), PR8 NS1 (residues 80–206), Ud NS1 (residues 83–205), VN NS1 (residues 79–206), and p85β (residues 435–599). All NS1 proteins contain W187A mutation to prevent protein dimerization and aggregation55. The incorporation of W187A mutation does not interfere with the binding to p85β23. All proteins were expressed with the N-terminal His6 and SUMO tags in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells and purified by Ni2+ NTA column chromatography. Tags were removed by SUMO protease and further purified by additional Ni2+ NTA column and gel-filtration chromatography. All purified proteins were >95% pure; the purity of protein samples was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.NMR sample preparationIsotopically labeled NS1 proteins for NMR studies were prepared by growing BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells in an M9 medium containing 15NH4Cl and 13C6 glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. For deuterium relaxation measurements, NS1 proteins were grown in an M9 medium containing 50% D2O/50% H2O with 15NH4Cl and 13C6 glucose. All NMR samples were prepared in a buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% D2O for PR8, Ud, and VN NS1s. NMR sample for 1918 NS1 was prepared in a buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 10% D2O. NS1 concentration in NMR samples was 150–200 μM.Biolayer interferometryThe binding of surface-immobilized NS1 to p85β was measured at 25 °C using an Octet RED biolayer interferometry (Pall ForteBio). The N-terminal His6 and SUMO-tagged NS1 proteins were used for immobilization. The buffer was 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 150 mM NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.6 M sucrose56. All reported values are the average and standard deviation of three repeated measurements. Association and dissociation data were fit using single exponential growth and decay functions, respectively, using GraphPad Prism (ver. 9). KD values were calculated using measured kon and koff values (KD = koff/kon). For core interface mutants, only kon values were calculated by fitting a linear equation to the plot of kobs vs. [p85].NMR resonance assignmentNMR experiments were conducted on Bruker 800- and 600-MHz spectrometers equipped with a cryogenic probe at the Biomolecular NMR facility (Texas A&M University). All NMR data were collected at 25 °C. NMR data were processed using NMRPipe57 and NMRFAM-SPARKY58. Sequential backbone assignments were performed using 3D triple resonance experiments, including HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, and HBHA(CO)NH. Side-chain methyl resonance assignments were performed using HCCH-TOCSY, H(CCO)NH, and C(CO)NH experiments. 13C-edited NOESY HSQC was performed with 100 ms mixing time. Chemical shifts for backbone atoms were deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank under accession code 51403 for VN NS1 and 51404 for PR8 NS1.RMSD-CSThe RMSD-CS values were calculated using the following equation.$${{{{{\rm{RMSD}}}}}}-{{{{{\rm{CS}}}}}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum ({\omega }_{x}(C{S}_{x,i}- < C{S}_{x} > ))^{2}}{N}}$$ (1) where ωx represents the weighting factor accounting for the differences in the gyromagnetic ratios of different types of nuclei. CS represents a chemical shift. i represents different strains (e.g., 1918, PR8, UD, and VN), and N represents the number of NS1s included in the calculation.NMR 15N Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion (RD)Constant relaxation time 15N CPMG RD36,37,38,59 data were recorded at 25 °C on Bruker 600- and 800-MHz NMR spectrometers with CPMG frequencies, ranging from 50 to 1000 Hz, as pseudo-three-dimensional experiments. The uncertainty of R2,eff was estimated by duplicated experiments. The relaxation dispersion data were fit using the Carver-Richards equation60 for a two-state exchange model. Residues undergoing a slow-exchange process were identified based on the Akaike information criterion.NMR order parametersThree relaxation parameters were measured for backbone amides of NS1s at 25 °C on Bruker 600 and 800 MHz NMR spectrometers. For 15N R1 and R2 constants, five relaxation time points were taken with a recycle delay of 2 s, as previously described. For the heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effect measurements, a recycle delay of 10 s was used in the reference experiment. The steady-state saturation of protons was performed by applying 180° pulses for 4 s61. 2H R1 and R1ρ relaxation parameters were measured at 25 °C on a Bruker 600 MHz NMR spectrometer; pulse sequences provided by Dr. José A. Caro were used after minor modifications. For 2H R1, six relaxation time points were taken between 0.05 and 50 ms. For 2H R1ρ, six relaxation time points were taken between 0.2 and 20 ms. Uncertainties of the relaxation parameters were estimated using duplicated measurements.The Lipari-Szabo model-free formalism was used to calculate order parameters42. Overall correlation times and rotational diffusion tensors for the axially symmetric model were estimated using the program Quadric62. Backbone order parameters S2NH were calculated using Mathematica (version 12) following the model-selection protocol and the Akaike information criterion63. Side-chain methyl axis order parameters S2axis were calculated using the following equation64.$$J(\omega )=(2/5)[{S}^{2}{\tau }_{m}/(1+{(\omega {\tau }_{m})}^{2})+(1-{S}^{2}){\tau }_{i}/(1+{(\omega {\tau }_{i})}^{2})]$$ (2) where S2 is an order parameter for the methyl group, τm is the overall correlation time, and τi−1 = τm−1 + τe,i−1 with τe,i is the effective correlation time of the internal motions for the 13C-2H bond vector. S2axis was calculated by S2 = 0.111S2axis, assuming tetrahedral geometry for the methyl group64.S2axis values of Leu 13Cδ, whose chemical shifts are larger than 24.5 ppm, were eliminated to prevent artifacts arising from a strong 13C-13C coupling on S2axis65.NMR H/D exchangeBuffer containing 150 μM 15N labeled NS1 was exchanged against 20 mM sodium phosphate (pD 7), 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, and 1 mM EDTA in 99.9% deuterium oxide using a spin desalting column (Micro Bio-Spin 6, BioRad). 15N-HSQC spectra were measured every 40 min for 106 h at 25 °C on Bruker 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. H/D exchange rates of backbone amide resonances of NS1 were calculated from a single exponential fit. Protection factors were calculated from the H/D exchange rate divided by the predicted intrinsic exchange rate from the program SPHERE66.X-ray crystallographyThe VN NS1 W187A:p85β complex was crystallized at 277 K by sitting-drop vapor diffusion in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.0) and 80 mM NaCl. The crystal was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in the reservoir solution containing 25% (v/v) glycerol. X-ray diffraction datasets were collected at 120 K using an R-AXIS IV++ image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku MicroMax 007HF X-ray generator. The data were processed using iMosflm in the CCP4 package67. The structure was remodeled and refined with Coot68 and the Phenix package (Supplementary Table 1). The crystal structure of VN NS1 W187A in a complex with p85β is deposited in the PDB (ID code: 7RCH). Protein structures were visualized using Pymol and ChimeraX 1.469.ITC measurementsAll ITC samples were prepared in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM TCEP. Data were recorded at 25 °C using a Microcal-PEAQ-ITC calorimeter (Malvern Panalytical). 100 μM p85β was in the syringe, and 10 μM NS1 was in the cell. 19 consecutive 2 μl aliquots of p85β were titrated into the cell. Data were fit using a 1:1 binding model to obtain Ka, ΔH, and ΔS using software provided with the instrument. All reported parameters are the average and standard deviation of two repeated measurements.Thermal shift analysisProtein melting temperatures (Tm) were measured using thermal shift analysis. 0.1 μM NS1 was mixed with Sypro Orange (S5692, Sigma-Aldrich) in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM TCEP. Data were recorded from 20 °C to 80 °C using a Quantamaster 400 fluorometer (Photon Technology International). Tm was calculated by fitting data to Boltzman sigmoid equation (GraphPad Prism).NS1 sequence comparisonThe NS1 sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega70 and the sequence logo was generated using WebLogo71.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

And it’s never too late to get vaccinated.ByDon RaufMedically ReviewedbyJane Yoon Scott, MDUpdated on September 26, 2022Flu and the common cold share similar symptoms, but the flu usually comes on stronger and lasts longer.CanvaGetting a flu shot isn’t a guarantee you won’t get the flu: The vaccines protect against the four strains of the influenza virus scientists predict will be most common each season, but if you’re exposed to a different strain, all bets are off. And because it takes about two weeks for immunity from flu to kick in post-vaccination, if you encounter a flu virus before that happens you could wind up sick.And having the flu is no joyride, with symptoms more comparable to COVID-19 than to the common cold. Flu is associated with a range of complications as well — from ear infections to pneumonia — although again, if you’re vaccinated you’ll be far less likely to have complications, according to a report published in June 2021 in the journal Vaccine.Whether you’ve been vaccinated or not, it’s important to understand how to recognize the symptoms of flu and if you or someone you care for winds up getting sick, to know the steps to take for a speedy recovery.How to Know It’s Really FluFirst things first: In order to know how to manage flu, you’ll need to make sure that’s what you’re dealing with. For example, it’s easy to mistake flu for COVID-19, or even a common cold, as all three can cause a cough, chest discomfort, sore throat, runny nose, and fatigue.But colds and COVID are caused by different viruses than influenza, so they do have some key differences. For one thing, “colds usually come on slowly, over several days, and cause mild illness,” explains Eric A. Weiss, MD, professor emeritus of emergency medicine at the Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto, California.Flu, on the other hand, can hit you like a truck: You suddenly feel weak and find yourself overcome with abrupt chills, a fever that gradually rises, muscle aches, shortness of breath, and fatigue.And like flu, COVID can cause severe illness, but is associated with a few unique symptoms. Chest pain is a common symptom for both, for example, but with flu it tends to be mild to moderate while COVID can cause persistent pain and interfere with breathing.The CDC recommends managing flu with rest and drinking plenty of water to prevent dehydration. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can help ease muscle aches and relieve fever. Because the virus is highly contagious, staying home is also important so as not to spread the sickness to others.When to Consider Antiviral DrugsAntivirals don’t actually kill the flu virus. Instead, they stop it from replicating or reproducing in the body. They can be helpful whether you have been vaccinated or not.When taken within 24 to 48 hours of when symptoms start, these prescription drugs make symptoms less severe and can shorten the amount of time you feel sick by about a day, says William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist and a professor of preventive medicine and health policy at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee.Four antiviral medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat flu:Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu), which comes as a capsule or liquid to be taken every 12 hours for five daysZanamivir (Relenza), an inhaled medication you take twice a day for five daysPeramivir (Rapivab), given once via infusion (through a needle into a vein) by a healthcare provider; the treatment takes 15 to 30 minutesBaloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), a one-and-done single-dose tablet that must be swallowed within 48 hours of the start of symptomsExperts don’t always agree about who should take antivirals for flu, but these medications generally are recommended for people who have severe flu symptoms or are at high risk for serious complications. If you fall into one of these categories, see your healthcare provider as soon as possible, as antivirals are most effective when taken early in the course of infection.When the Going Gets ToughExtreme flu symptoms require immediate medical attention. The most common are:A high fever (103 or above) or one that lasts four or more daysTrouble breathing or shortness of breathPain or pressure in the chest or abdomenSudden or persistent dizziness or confusionFlu-like symptoms that seem to improve or go away, then get worse or come back“If you’re getting worse, if you’re having difficulty breathing, or if you’re so sick you can’t keep fluids down and you’re getting dehydrated, you absolutely need to seek medical care,” says Dr. Schaffner.He advises people who are especially vulnerable to flu complications — those over 65, pregnant people, and people with chronic illnesses — to be on the alert for extreme symptoms. Parents should also keep an eye on kids who come down with the flu.How Vaccinations HelpThe CDC advises everyone older than 6 months get a flu shot. Again, although the vaccine is not a guarantee you won’t come down with the flu, it’s estimated it can reduce the risk of illness by 40 to 60 percent.What’s more, it’s never too late to get vaccinated, Weiss says. Although flu season peaks from December through February, it can last well into May. Also, the predominant flu strains circulating in a single season can change, so even if you get the flu early you should still get vaccinated to protect yourself from the possibility you’ll encounter a different strain later in the season.Weiss advises people with mild upper respiratory infections (colds) get vaccinated even if they are sick, but people who have moderate to severe illnesses with or without a fever should wait until they recover or consult their doctor before getting vaccinated.“Vaccination doesn’t influence the effectiveness of the treatment,” says Schaffner. “The vaccine makes it likely that you will have a less severe infection, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get treatment in addition.”Meet Our ExpertsSee Our Editorial PolicyMeet Our Health Expert NetworkJane Yoon Scott, MDMedical ReviewerJane Yoon Scott, MD, is an infectious disease physician and an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University in Atlanta.

An illustration of the influenza virus (giant blue sphere) surrounded by human antibodies (small orange Y shapes). (Image credit: NANOCLUSTERING/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY) It's the time of year for flu shots, but you might not know that there is more than one kind of flu vaccine. Indeed, half a dozen different types of flu shots are available for the 2022-2023 season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). So which one should you get?In general, flu shots are recommended for everyone ages 6 months and older. The specific types of vaccines you can get depend mainly on your age, and certain flu vaccines are preferentially recommended for older adults. In addition, certain health conditions may affect which flu shot you can get. Here's a rundown of the different types of flu vaccines available, and who's recommended to get them.People younger than 65 years oldFlucelvax Quadrivalent is approved for those aged 6 months and over. (Image credit: Bloomberg / Contributor via Getty Images)For people younger than 65, the CDC does not preferentially recommend one type of flu vaccine over the other. That means people in this age group can choose to receive any flu vaccine type that's approved for their age group. According to the CDC, these include:Standard-dose, inactivated flu vaccines: These vaccines contain flu viruses that are grown in chicken's eggs and then inactivated (killed). They are approved for people ages 6 months and older. A number of different brands of standard-dose flu shots exist, including: Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent and Fluzone Quadrivalent.Cell-based flu vaccine: There is one cell-based flu vaccine available for the 2022-2023 flu season, called Flucelvax Quadrivalent. Rather than being grown in eggs, flu viruses in this vaccine are grown in cultured mammalian cells, meaning the vaccine is completely egg-free. This vaccine also contains inactivated flu viruses. It is approved for people ages 6 months and older.Recombinant flu vaccine: There is one recombinant flu shot approved for the 2022-2023 flu season, called Flublok Quadrivalent. (The vaccine uses recombinant DNA technology, when scientists use genetic engineering techniques to combine DNA from multiple sources to create a new DNA molecule.) This vaccine doesn't use the full influenza virus or chicken's eggs in the production process. Instead, this vaccine is made synthetically. To make the vaccine, researchers combine a flu virus gene with a baculovirus — a virus that grows well in insect cells but doesn’t cause disease in humans — according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. This "recombinant" virus is then replicated in insect cells. The flu gene instructs the cells to produce a flu virus protein, and this protein is then harvested and purified to create the vaccine. It is approved for people ages 18 and older.Flu nasal spray: There is one flu nasal spray available for the 2022-2023 season, called FluMist Quadrivalent, which is made using chicken's eggs. It contains flu viruses that have been attenuated (weakened) rather than killed, though these weakened flu viruses cannot cause the flu, Live Science previously reported. It is approved for people ages 2 through 49 years old. But certain groups of people should not get the flu nasal spray, including people who are pregnant and those with weakened immune systems (immunocompromised), according to the CDC.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.There is also an option of a nasal flu vaccine. (Image credit: TEK IMAGE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)If all the flu shot options have you suffering from the agony of choice, the most important thing to keep in mind is to get one of the flu vaccines available to you every year, according to the CDC. If you have questions about flu vaccines, you can speak with your healthcare provider about your options. Here are some more things to consider:Availability and cost: Your pharmacist or healthcare provider may only stock a couple of versions of the flu shot. You can speak with them about which shots they offer, and how much they cost, if not covered by your insurance.Egg allergies: People with egg allergies can still receive any flu vaccine that's approved for their age group, according to the CDC. Most flu shots use eggs in the manufacturing process, but only very small amounts of egg protein end up in these flu vaccines. Studies have found that people with egg allergies are very unlikely to have a severe reaction to flu vaccines. The rate of anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction) after flu shots is about 1 case per million vaccine doses given, according to the CDC. People who have severe allergic reactions to egg, such as trouble breathing, swelling under the skin, lightheadedness or recurrent vomiting, or who have required epinephrine treatment for their egg allergy, should receive their flu shot under the supervision of a healthcare provider who can treat severe allergic reactions, according to the CDC. People who wish to avoid vaccines made with eggs can get the cell-based or recombinant flu vaccines, which are egg-free.Side effects: The flu nasal spray may cause a slightly different set of side effects compared with vaccines that contain inactivated (killed) flu viruses. Common side effects of inactivated vaccines can include redness at the injection site, fever, muscle aches, headache and fatigue. Side effects of the nasal spray may include runny nose, sore throat, headache and cough, and in children, wheezing, vomiting and a low grade fever.If you're afraid of needles: With the exception of the flu nasal spray, flu vaccines are given through a needle injection. But one brand of the standard-dose flu vaccine, Afluria Quadrivalent, can be given through a so-called jet injector for people ages 18 through 64, according to the CDC. A jet injector uses a high-pressure stream of fluid to inject the vaccine through the skin, instead of a needle.People 65 and olderDifferent flu vaccines are recommended for those 65 and over. (Image credit: Shutterstock)Starting in the 2022-2023 flu season, the CDC recommends that people ages 65 and older preferably get vaccinated with one of the following three flu vaccines: The high-dose flu vaccine, called Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent vaccine. This egg-based vaccine is approved for people ages 65 and older and contains four times the amount of flu antigen (the part of the flu vaccine that induces an immune response) compared with the standard-dose vaccines.The adjuvanted flu vaccine, called Fluad Quadrivalent adjuvanted flu vaccine. This vaccine is also egg-based and approved for people ages 65 and older. It contains an ingredient, called an adjuvant, that helps boost the immune response to the vaccine.The recombinant flu vaccine (Flublok Quadrivalent). The recombinant vaccine contains three times the amount of antigen than standard-dose vaccines, which can induce a stronger immune response.The CDC recommends these vaccines for people ages 65 and older because recent studies suggest that these three vaccines are potentially more effective for older adults compared with other versions of the flu shot, according to the CDC. (In general, older adults may have a reduced immune response to vaccines compared with younger people due to immune system changes that happen with age.) For example, For example, a 2014 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) randomly assigned more than 31,000 older adults to receive either the standard dose or high dose flu shot, and found that the high dose flu shot was 24% more effective at preventing flu illness compared with the standard dose. Another study, published in 2017 in NEJM, randomly assigned 9,000 older adults to receive either the standard dose flu vaccine or recombinant flu vaccine; and found that the recombinant vaccine reduced the likelihood of influenza illness by 30% compared with the standard dose."Given their increased risk of flu-associated severe illness, hospitalization, and death, it's important to use these potentially more effective vaccines in people 65 years and older," Dr. José R. Romero, director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a statement. Among these three vaccines, the CDC does not recommend one over the other, as they were all linked with increased protection for older adults. So older adults can get the one most readily available to them, according to AARP, the nonprofit organization that focuses on issues of people over 50. But if the recommended shots aren't available, older adults shouldn't wait to get vaccinated and should receive a standard-dose version of the shot instead, according to the CDC.This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.Originally published on Live Science.

Written by: Savannah KoplonMedia contact: Anna Jones UAB physicians urge people to get flu shots early in the season.The change of season in October and November brings in crisp, fall weather for the majority of the United States. Many begin to look toward the holiday season to come, but few think about the impending cold weather and subsequent sickness that pops up when winter arrives. Physicians at the University of Alabama at Birmingham have their sights firmly set on influenza season, however, and want to encourage everyone to get a flu shot between now and early November. That is when the cold sets in for many in the United States, and flu germs historically begin to thrive. The flu vaccine is the best protection for the flu and how to protect others from the flu as well, says Stephen Russell, M.D., professor in UAB’s Division of General Internal Medicine and physician at UAB Medicine Leeds. The vaccine prepares the immune system to see, recognize and fight off the flu virus. “Flu season starts in early October, and the reason is that, by the time we see more cases of flu and in the hospital – which is usually at the beginning of November – we want people to be protected,” Russell shared. “It takes about two weeks from the time you get your flu shot for your body to develop antibodies that fight the flu, which is why we recommend that everybody gets the flu shot in October or early November. That way, by the time we see more flu in the community, people’s bodies are ready to fight off the virus.” Russell has had patients ask if getting the flu shot actually means his patients are receiving the flu virus, but he says that is not the case. Some people believe that, if they get sick immediately after receiving the vaccine, they have the flu, he says. “We know from very good medical studies and science that the flu vaccine does not give you the flu,” he said. “If you experience body aches and have a low-grade fever 24 hours after you get a flu vaccine, we consider that a success because your immune system is revved up and ready to fight off the flu. We can almost guarantee that 48 hours after that you will feel normal, which means your immune system is ready to fight off the flu this season.” Russell notes that, if you actually have the flu, you can expect to experience seven days of aches, along with several days of feeling bad overall, including experiencing cough and fever. With the flu shot, your mild symptoms will last less than 48 hours. If people are unable to or forget to get the flu shot early in the season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says you can still get the shot for ample protection through January. However, when there are higher numbers of reported cases of the flu, your immune system is more susceptible to acquiring the flu if you are unprotected. Members of the community can find out where they can get a flu shot in their area by visiting the CDC’s vaccine finder. UAB employees and UAB students can get free flu shots on campus throughout the season. back to top More News UAB Experts Arts Campus Health & Medicine People of UAB Research News You Can Use Contact Us Media Policy Guidelines UAB News Studio Visual Content UAB Did You Know RSS Feed Generator Marketing and Communications UAB Home The University of Alabama at Birmingham 1720 2nd Ave South Birmingham, AL 35294 Public Relations: (205) 934-3884 Media Specialist On Call: (205) 934-3411 Contact UAB | Cookie Settings | A-Z Site Index | Privacy | Terms of Use | © 2024 The University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB is an Equal Employment/Equal Educational Opportunity Institution dedicated to providing equal opportunities and equal access to all individuals regardless of race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, sex (including pregnancy), genetic information, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and veteran’s status.

Which Shot Should You Get First This Fall?Written by David Mills on September 26, 2022Share on PinterestExperts say it is OK to get a flu shot and a COVID-19 booster at the same time, but it’s not necessary either. Victor Bordera/StocksyAs the official start of autumn approaches, there are two important decisions to be made when it comes to vaccinations.The first is when to get your annual influenza shot.Experts say Australia is finishing up a flu season in which the illness started early and finished strong. They warn the United States could be in store for a similar pattern as our winter season draws near.The second decision is when to get the new Omicron-specific COVID-19 booster shot that was authorized by the Food and Drug Administration a few weeks ago.The Pfizer and Moderna versions of that new booster are starting to arrive in pharmacies and other locations.The recommendations to get both vaccinations may raise some questions for individuals.Should you get both at the same time or space them out? Which one should you get first?Healthline put these questions to two infectious disease experts.Dr. Monica Gandhi, MPH, is a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco.Dr. William Schaffner is a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.Should you get a flu shot and a COVID-19 Omicron booster at the same time?Schaffner: You can receive both a flu shot and the updated COVID booster at the same time. Your immune response will be just as good as when the vaccines are given separately. Also, there is no increase in serious adverse reactions – although be mindful that you may experience two sore arms for a day or so.Gandhi: The short answer is that we don’t have data on the simultaneous administration of the influenza vaccine and the new COVID-19 boosters. However, there was a study called the ComFluCov study performed in the United Kingdom on the concomitant administration of the older formulations of the COVID-19 vaccines with the seasonal flu shot… This study showed that administering both simultaneously did not lead to an increase in adverse effects and the increase in SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was not significantly different if the shots were spaced out or given at the same time. One limitation is that this study did not report on neutralizing antibody titers (which are really important) nor T cell immune responses to COVID-19 with the two different timings, but this U.K. study does give us some reassurance that – if easier for you logistically – you can go ahead and get the flu shot and the new COVID-19 booster at the same time.If you get the shots at the same time, should you get them in the same arm?Gandhi: The CDC advises that two vaccines given simultaneously be given at least one inch apart. However, given that some people have injection site reactions with both vaccines, I would recommend the shots be given in different arms. Again, there is no contraindication to giving them in the same arm except to have the injection site reactions minimized by having the two shots distributed.Schaffner: If you are getting the flu vaccine and the COVID vaccine at the same time, most providers will give them in separate arms. It is possible to give both vaccines in the same arm, but the inoculation sites must be spaced at least an inch apart and that may present some difficulties, especially in smaller persons. That said, the substantial majority of both patients and healthcare providers prefer to give the two vaccines in separate arms when they are being received at the same time.What is the minimum amount of time you should have between the flu and COVID-19 inoculations?Schaffner: If you decide to get the flu vaccine and the updated COVID booster on separate days, there is no required time interval between the two vaccines that you need to wait.Gandhi: I think you can get the two shots at the same time per the COVID ComfluCov study we discussed above. However, I did want to discuss the minimum amount of timing between this new booster and your last booster for COVID-19 since we had a more frequent booster strategy in 2021 for COVID shots than the routine vaccine schedule for influenza. I would recommend at least 6 months from your last infection or booster before getting this Omicron-specific booster as I wrote in a piece in TIME (this may also have an influence on timing your booster with the flu vaccine). Recent research studies during the Omicron variant era continue to demonstrate the benefit of an extended interval between doses in terms of increasing both neutralizing antibodies and memory B cells. A booster provides antibody protection for at least 6 months according to a recent study. Another study demonstrated that antibody levels stabilized 6 to 9 months post-vaccination for study participants both with and without previous infection. One of the aims of the Omicron-specific vaccines is to increase antibodies and prevent even mild infections. The antibody level plateau at the 6-month mark would thus signal an ideal time to boost with a BA.4/5-focused vaccine since a low pre-boost antibody level actually correlated with a greater fold increase post-boosting.Which vaccine should you get first? The flu shot or the COVID-19 booster?Schaffner: It depends. The best time to get the flu vaccine is during October or the first two weeks of November. That will help assure that your protection will last throughout the flu season into March. If it has been several months since your last COVID vaccine dose, your protection is starting to wane, so getting your updated COVID booster might be first on your “to do” list. A reminder: it should be at least 2 months since your last dose of COVID vaccine or at least 3 months since you have recovered from COVID infection before you get the new updated COVID booster.Gandhi: Now that we have discussed timing your COVID updated Omicron booster six months after your last booster (or infection), you can get the influenza vaccine first this fall if you are waiting until later fall-early winter for your COVID-19 booster. Otherwise, as we discussed above, data shows that it is fine to get them together.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by David Mills on September 26, 2022Read this nextPfizer Says Bivalent COVID-19 Booster Significantly Increases Antibodies to Fight OmicronNew COVID-19 boosters could be authorized by the FDA before full data from human trials are in because of past data on similar vaccines.

Meanwhile, flu season, which usually sets in during the fall and winter — though "the timing and during of flu activity has been less predictable" since COVID, the Centers for Disease Control states — is on the minds of just about everyone.As such, many people are considering another COVID booster along with their influenza vaccination. Others are wondering if it is safe to get a booster shot if you just had COVID. Some may be concerned about possible issues with getting both shots, raising questions about safety, interactions, and timing.First things first, you should know that it is perfectly safe to get both a COVID booster and a flu shot at the same time, according to Lehigh Valley Health Network Chief Infection Control Officer Dr. Alex N. Benjamin."There are no known interactions between the two, so a person can get the COVID booster and the flu shot at the same time," Benjamin said, and the CDC confirmed.Of interestSpace, staff and supplies: Northeast Pa. hospitals talk COVID challenges and changesCan you still get vaccinated if you recently had COVID-19?As for those who have recently had a case of COVID and are considering the booster, Benjamin recommends taking some time before getting it done in order ensure effectiveness."A person who is recovering from a COVID infection can get a booster as soon as they are able to come out of isolation. However, getting a booster so soon after infection may interfere with gaining the most benefit from the vaccine. Waiting two to three months after an infection can give you the most benefit," Benjamin said.On the other hand, if you happen to contract the flu and recover, feel free to schedule a flu shot, "as long as the infected person meets the criteria to be out of isolation, they can get the influenza vaccine… In this situation, waiting is not necessary," Benjamin said.Should I get vaccinated for monkeypox?Since monkeypox has been a hot topic across the country over the last few months, vaccination questions are popping up left and right, especially when it comes to interactions with other shots.The CDC recommends that most people, especially adolescent or young adult males, wait around four weeks after getting a monkeypox vaccination before receiving a COVID booster, "because of the observed risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis after receipt of ACAM2000 orthopoxvirus vaccine and mRNA (i.e., Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) and Novavax COVID-19 vaccines and the unknown risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis after JYNNEOS administration."Although relatively rare, myocarditis is nothing to sneeze at: it can produce chest pain, shortness of breath, and feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart. According to the Mayo Clinic, severe myocarditis may weaken the heart to a point where the body does not get enough blood, leading to clots in the heart, and the potential for a stroke or heart attack."When reported, the (myocarditis) cases have especially been in adolescents and young adult males within several days after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna," the CDC reports.If you are concerned about any potential interactions, always make sure to tell your physician about your recent inoculations prior to getting a COVID, flu or monkeypox vaccine.Which vaccine or booster shot should you get?Simply put, just about everyone should get vaccinated against COVID, according to the CDC: "CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccines for everyone ages 6 months and older, and boosters for everyone 5 years and older, if eligible," the agency's website states.The type of booster one receives — whether it is Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson and Johnson — does not matter, as the Food and Drug Administration approved "mixing-and-matching" back in April 2022."Just as a current reminder, Pfizer's vaccine is currently available for those 12 and older. Moderna's is available for those 18 and older. Under this new authorization, Pfizer's vaccine would become available for those aged five to 11 and Moderna's for those aged six to 17 years. And, of course, the government has said it's ordered more than 170 million updated vaccine booster doses for the fall and last week it had sent out over 25 million doses," American Medical Association Vice President of Science, Medicine, and Public Health Andrea Garcia, JD, MPH, said.Likewise, the CDC advises influenza vaccines for anyone six years of age and older, with rare exceptions: "some people (for example, pregnant people and people with some chronic health conditions) should not get some types of influenza vaccines, and some people should not receive flu vaccines at all (though this is uncommon)."Those under the age of 65 can get just about any flu vaccine, while the CDC advises those over 65 to consider the Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent vaccine, the Flublok Quadrivalent recombinant flu vaccine or the Fluad Quadrivalent adjuvanted flu vaccine.“Getting a flu vaccine is more important than ever this year because it can reduce the risk of illness, hospitalization, and death from the flu,” Benjamin said. “This flu season may be more severe than in year’s past based on how influenza has been acting in other parts of the world. Like many respiratory illnesses, influenza can be spread by infected individuals who are not showing symptoms, and if we are not masking as often as we have in recent years, we could see increased transmission. Therefore, we strongly encourage everyone to make it their responsibility to get vaccinated.”Monkeypox vaccinations are a bit different. The CDC does not advise the general population to get a vaccine, though there are a few conditions in which you may want to look into getting a JYNNEOS or ACAM2000 vaccine, which helps prevent the spread of the virus that causes monkeypox.If you have already been exposed to monkeypox through a close contact or sexual partner, especially homosexual men, transgender or nonbinary individuals, it is certainly advisable to schedule a shot. Furthermore, if you believe you might be exposed in similar circumstances, or if you have had more than one sex partner or a new diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease in the past six months, the vaccines could be helpful.Regional hospitals:LVHN honored for COVID-19 vaccination strategyHow to schedule a COVID, monkeypox or flu vaccine in northeast PAOne of the easiest ways to schedule a vaccine for any condition is to contact your primary care physician. However, there are other options available, just in case you cannot set an appointment.Starting Oct. 1, LVHN will begin their free drive-thru flu shot clinics. To sign up, go to the LVHN flu shot website.Pharmacies including Rite Aid, CVS, and Walgreens are also offering flu shots. Appointments can be scheduled on their respective websites as well.You can also set up a COVID shot through those same pharmacy portals, or you can find a booster or any other COVID vaccine by visiting the Vaccines.gov website.While patients seeking flu or COVID vaccines may either schedule appointments online or simply walk in to some providers, the monkeypox vaccine is more difficult to obtain. The DOH recommends consulting your primary care physician to see if they offer the monkeypox vaccine, or contacting 877-PA-HEALTH to find a location.

Coping strategies that can help / Heart Health More protection for your heart? It's just a shot away You can lower your risks for heart attack, stroke, and death from heart disease by staying current on vaccinations. October 1, 2022 By Julie Corliss, Executive Editor, Harvard Heart Letter Reviewed by Deepak L. Bhatt, M.D., M.P.H, Former Editor in Chief, Harvard Heart Letter With all the attention on COVID-19 vaccines over the past two years, you may have neglected to receive other routine vaccines recommended for older adults — namely, those that protect against influenza, pneumonia, and shingles. But if you have heart disease or are at risk for it, these shots are important. And early fall is a great time to get back on schedule. Earlier this year, a large study confirmed that flu vaccines may help lower the risk of serious cardiovascular complications (see "Flu shot linked to lower heart-related risks"). The risk of heart attack and stroke rises in the year following a bout of either pneumonia (a serious lung infection caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi) or shingles (a reawakening of the chickenpox virus that emerges through the nerves and causes a painful rash). Vaccines can help lower these risks as well. "COVID puts an important and renewed focus on the link between infections and cardiovascular disease," says Dr. Ankeet S. Bhatt, a cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital. Even a mild COVID-19 infection can raise a person's risk of heart problems (see "How COVID-19 can compromise your heart health" in the July 2022 Heart Letter). But physicians have long known that serious infections — especially the flu — can leave people more vulnerable to a heart attack, heart failure, and dying from heart disease. Flu shot linked to lower heart-related risks Even healthy people can develop serious complications from a bout of influenza (flu), with those 65 and older facing the greatest risk. Can getting a flu vaccine help lower the risk of heart-related problems? A study in the April 1, 2022, issue of JAMA Network Open explored this question. What: Data pooled from six separate studies done between 2000 and 2021. Who: 9,001 people in total, with an average age of 66. Just over half had heart disease, and about 43% were women. How: Researchers compared the rates of heart-related problems (including heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and death from heart disease) between people who received a flu vaccine and people who received a placebo or no vaccine. They followed participants for an average of nine months. Key findings: People who received a flu vaccine had a 34% lower risk of serious heart problems compared with those who didn't get the vaccine. Among those who'd had a heart attack in the year before they got vaccinated, the risk was 45% lower. Infection dangers When you have any type of infection, your body releases molecules called cytokines, which stimulate your immune system to combat the offending pathogen. This response can affect the cardiovascular system via two different pathways, Dr. Bhatt explains. "Cytokines can depress the heart's ability to pump normally. The resulting immune response also seems to be involved in accelerating the buildup of plaque inside the arteries, known as atherosclerosis," he says. Influenza A yearly flu shot may lower your risk of catching the disease roughly by half. The CDC recommends getting the vaccine in September or October. Several different types of flu shots are available; experts advise getting whichever one is most readily available. If you're 65 or older, three vaccines (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent, Flublock Quadrivalent recombinant, and Fluad Quadrivalent adjuvanted) may offer slightly better protection than the regular-dose shot and are the preferred choice. Pneumonia This year, the FDA approved two new pneumonia vaccines, PCV20 (Prevnar 20) and PCV15 (Vaxneuvance). They replace two older vaccines, PCV13 and PPSV23. The CDC now recommends that people ages 65 or older, as well as adults younger than 65 at high risk for pneumococcal disease, get either a single dose of PCV20 a dose of PCV15, followed a year later by a dose of the older vaccine PPSV23. If you have already received one or two of the older vaccines, ask your doctor whether you need another shot. Shingles Everyone 50 and older should get two doses of the shingles vaccine (Shingrix), given two to six months apart. You should still get this vaccine even if you're not sure you had chickenpox as a child you've already had shingles you got the earlier shingles vaccine, Zostavax, which is no longer available in the United States.

Cold & FluStay Safe This Flu SeasonShare this articleShareShare on FacebookShare on XShare on PinterestCopy LinkCold and Flu Complications: How Dangerous Are They?Even a mild cold or bout of influenza can compromise your immune system and lead to other health concerns.ByErinn ConnorMedically ReviewedbyJane Yoon Scott, MDUpdated on September 26, 2022On This PageWho's Most at RiskTypes of ComplicationsCold vs. FluTreatment RisksWhen to Call a DoctorOn This PageWho's Most at RiskTypes of ComplicationsCold vs. FluTreatment RisksWhen to Call a DoctorA cold or the flu can reduce your body’s ability to fight off other infections.Getty ImagesMost colds and bouts of flu can be treated at home and only last a week or two. But sometimes these infections can lead to moderate or potentially serious health complications such as bronchitis or pneumonia. People with weakened immune systems, asthma, or respiratory conditions are especially at risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (1)How do secondary infections happen? “It could be the immune system gets tired and another infection is able to come in,” says David Weitzman, MD, an urgent care physician in South Carolina and a board member of the American Academy of Urgent Care Medicine. “Or you’re exposed to a second type of virus or bacteria and get sick again.”Who Is Most at Risk for Cold and Flu Complications?Certain groups of people are especially at risk of developing cold- or flu-related complications, according to the CDC:Adults 65 and Older People in this age group account for 50 to 70 percent of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations and between 70 and 85 percent of seasonal flu-related deaths. (2)Young Children As many as 26,000 children 5 and under in the United States wind up in the hospital due to the flu each year. (3)Pregnant People Normal changes to the immune system, heart, and lungs during pregnancy can raise the risk of severe illness from the flu. The flu may also be harmful to a developing baby. The CDC advises people who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant to get the annual flu shot. (4)Adults With Preexisting Conditions These include chronic illnesses such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, and HIV or AIDS. (5)American Indians and Alaska Natives Research has shown these groups experience a disproportionate number of flu-related hospitalizations compared with the general U.S. population. (6)RELATED: 8 Home Remedies to Stop a Bad CoughWhat Complications Can a Cold or the Flu Cause?Potential complications of colds and flu include:BronchitisBronchitis — inflammation of the airways that carry air to and from the lungs — is commonly caused by cold and flu viruses, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Bacteria and inhaled irritants can also cause bronchitis. The most common symptom is coughing laced with mucus. Others include shortness of breath and wheezing. (7)DehydrationColds and the flu can affect the appetite, decreasing the amount of food and fluids a person takes in. This can lead to dehydration. Other factors can include symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, according to the Mayo Clinic (8).Signs of dehydration in infants or young children include listlessness, no wet diapers for three hours, a dry mouth and tongue, and no tears when crying. Adults may develop extreme thirst, urinate less, produce darker-colored urine, or feel dizzy, confused, or fatigued. (9)Severe dehydration is a medical emergency and may require treatment with intravenous fluids.Ear Infection“Earaches are common with colds, because of inflammation of the eardrum,” Dr. Rosenfeld says. Children are especially susceptible to middle-ear infections because their Eustachian tubes (which connect the ear and back of the nose) are shorter, floppier, and more horizontal than those of adults, which makes it easier for bacteria in the back of the nose to reach the ear.MyocarditisMyocarditis, inflammation of the middle layer of the wall of the heart (the myocardium), can be caused by cold or flu viruses, as well as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, according to the Mayo Clinic. It may begin with mild symptoms, such as fatigue or shortness of breath, but it can lead to arrhythmia (rapid or abnormal heart rhythms), heart attack, or stroke. (10)MyositisViral infections like influenza can cause inflammation that damages muscle fibers, a condition called infectious myositis, according to Harvard Health. The main symptom is weakness, but muscle aches and tenderness aren’t uncommon. Myositis usually subsides on its own in a few days or weeks. (11)PericarditisPericarditis, inflammation of the sac of tissue surrounding the heart (pericardium), is commonly caused by viral infections including colds, the flu, and COVID-19, according to the American Heart Association. The symptoms of pericarditis are sharp chest pain resembling a heart attack as well as fever, weakness, and coughing. Pericarditis usually gets better with little or no treatment, but severe cases require hospitalization and surgery. (12)PneumoniaAs with COVID-19, cold and influenza viruses can lead to pneumonia, a common and potentially life-threatening lung infection. These viruses can lead to viral pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia, with the latter usually being more serious, according to the American Lung Association. (13)Symptoms of pneumonia include cough, fever, shortness of breath, rapid and shallow breathing, and nausea and vomiting (especially in small children). If untreated, pneumonia can become severe, with signs such as difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, and a bluish tint to the lips and nail beds, according to the American Lung Association. (14)Sinus InfectionAcute sinusitis, which is inflammation of the sinuses that causes a buildup of mucus, is most often caused by a cold, according to Harvard Health. The most common symptoms are congestion, headache and facial pain, and discolored mucus. Others include loss of smell or taste, cough, bad breath, fever, toothache, and the sensation of fullness in the ears. (15)RELATED: No Flu Shot and Now You Have the Flu: What to DoAre All Complications of a Cold or Flu the Same?While both a cold and the flu can cause complications such as sinus and ear infections, complications from the flu (as is the case with COVID-19) are generally more serious and more likely to lead to conditions that require hospitalization, like pneumonia, according to the CDC. (16)Learn More About How to Tell the Difference Between a Cold and the FluCan Cold or Flu Treatment Cause Complications?Over-the-counter pain relievers and fever reducers can lessen the symptoms of a cold and the flu, but some can there can be complications.For instance, taking too much acetaminophen (Tylenol) can damage the liver. According to the Cleveland Clinic, adults should not take more than 4 grams a day. For people with liver conditions, the limit is 2 grams per day. (17)Aspirin has been associated with a risk of Reye’s (also called Reye) syndrome in children and teenagers who have a viral infection such as the flu. Reye’s syndrome is a rare but serious condition that causes swelling of the brain and liver damage, according to the Mayo Clinic. (18)Prescription antiviral drugs for treating the flu may have side effects. The most common side effects of oseltamivir (Tamiflu), for instance, are nausea and vomiting. (19)When Should I Seek Medical Help?The emergency warning signs of flu differ for adults and children. For adults, they include: (20)Trouble breathing or shortness of breathPersistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomenPersistent dizziness, confusion, or inability to rouse from sleepSeizuresNot urinatingSevere muscle painSevere weakness or unsteadinessFever or cough that improves but then returns or worsensWorsening of chronic medical conditions with fever and a worse coughEmergency warning signs for children with the flu include:Rapid breathing or trouble breathingBluish lips or faceRibs pulling in with each breathChest painSevere muscle pain (child refuses to walk)Dehydration (no urine for eight hours, dry mouth, no tears when crying)Not alert or interacting when awakeSeizuresFever above 104 degrees; in babies under 12 weeks, any feverFever or cough that improves but then returns or worsensWorsening of chronic medical conditionsMany of these symptoms resemble those seen with COVID-19, so the CDC recommends people who develop them be tested for COVID-19, particularly if they’re at risk for serious illness from the virus.As with a cold and the flu, people 65 and older and anyone with a chronic medical condition —including asthma (moderate to severe), diabetes, cancer, heart disease, stroke, being overweight or obese, and/or a weakened immune system — is at increased risk for serious illness from COVID-19.What Happens if Flu Is Not Treated?Most people with the flu recover within a few days or weeks without seeing a doctor or using prescription antiviral drugs. But if your symptoms are severe or you’re in a high-risk group, going untreated could have serious and potentially life-threatening consequences. Don’t delay: Antiviral medications are most effective when you begin taking them within the first two days of feeling sick, says the CDC. (21)Getting diagnosed right away is also key, particularly in light of the risks associated with COVID-19. If you have any of the following symptoms, you should get tested to determine whether you have a cold, the flu, or COVID-19:FeverChillsCoughShortness of breathFatigueMuscle achesHeadacheLoss of taste or smellSore throatCongestionRunny noseNausea or vomitingDiarrheaEditorial Sources and Fact-CheckingEveryday Health follows strict sourcing guidelines to ensure the accuracy of its content, outlined in our editorial policy.

This is like a flu,” former President Donald Trump insisted at a Feb. 26, 2020, press briefing, just as the virus hit the U.S. “It’s a little like a regular flu that we have flu shots for.” While the two can present with similar symptoms—like fever, cough, fatigue, sore throat, muscle aches, and headache—and are both more likely to be fatal for the elderly and immunocompromised, the comparison falls apart when it comes to the death toll. One graph in particular shows just how stark the mortality difference is between the two. Flu deaths appear almost flat compared to surges in COVID deaths over the past three years. “We’re now trying to treat [COVID] like a seasonal influenza and it’s just not yet,” Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), recently told Fortune. There were 1,055 COVID deaths in the U.S. two weeks ago, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, compared to only 4 flu deaths the same week. COVID deaths have spiked several times over the past few years due to new variants of the virus, taking hundreds of thousands of lives annually (463,210 last year). By contrast, the flu only took an estimated 22,000 lives during the 2019-2020 season, according to the CDC. Over the past 12 years, the flu’s estimated annual death toll has been as low as 12,000, but never higher than 61,000—just an eighth of COVID’s death toll in the first year of the pandemic. Since the earliest days of the pandemic, weekly COVID deaths have been at least 15 times that of weekly flu deaths—and sometimes as much as 811 times. Here for the long haul COVID’s death toll is unlikely to sink to flu levels any time soon, experts say, even though U.S. health officials have expressed hope that COVID boosters will soon become an annual occurrence, much like the flu shot. “I think COVID deaths will continue to exceed flu deaths for a while, unless we see something new in influenza,” like a deadlier strain developing, Dr. Stuart Ray, vice chair of medicine for data integrity and analytics at Johns Hopkins Department of Medicine, recently told Fortune. When it comes to leading causes of death in the U.S., COVID has landed as No. 3 for the last two years, while influenza and pneumonia, grouped together, have landed as No. 9, according to the CDC. Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees with Ray. He says COVID is likely to remain a leading cause of death in the U.S. “for the next couple of years,” as the population builds more immunity and science develops more effective tools to fight the virus—as long as the virus doesn’t evade those tools. Eventually, the CDC will likely collapse COVID deaths into the flu and pneumonia deaths category, Adalja predicts. But he still expects COVID to have an “outsized” death toll when compared to other infectious diseases in the U.S., like the flu, for the foreseeable future. One thing is certain, according to Adalja: Whether COVID continues to be a top killer in the U.S. and globally, or whether its fatality rate eventually sinks to that of the present-day flu, COVID is here to stay. To think that the new virus will be stamped out, and that life will revert to like it was in 2019, is “magical thinking,” he said. “Not in the history of the human species have we had a new infectious disease appear that just disappears,” he said. “As long as there are humans on this planet, there are going to be COVID-19 infections on this planet.”Sign up for the Fortune Features email list so you don’t miss our biggest features, exclusive interviews, and investigations.Latest in Health0 minutes agoHealth - chemicalsEndocrine-disrupting chemicals are everywhere.

This is especially true for groups at higher risk of experiencing flu-related complications, including people 65 years and older, people with chronic health conditions, people who are pregnant, and children."As the flu virus changes each year, the flu vaccinations are reformulated to add coverage for new strains of the influenza virus, so it's important for your entire family to get them, especially older adults and young children," says Jonathan Subaitani, physician assistant at Saltzer Health.Is the flu shot effective?According to data from the CDC, during the 2020 flu season, flu vaccination prevented an estimated 7.5 million influenza illnesses, 3.7 million influenza-associated medical visits, 105,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations, and 6,300 influenza-associated deaths. Research also indicates that the flu vaccine reduces doctor visits by 40% to 60%.Who should get the flu shot?According to Saltzer Health, in most cases, people six months and older should get a flu shot prior to the peak of flu season, which typically takes place between October and March. People 65 years and older tend to be the most adversely affected by the flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in recent years 50% to 70% of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations and 70% to 85% of seasonal flu-related deaths have occurred in those 65 and older. Because it takes two weeks after being vaccinated to develop antibodies to the flu virus, you should plan to schedule your flu shot in September.You can reach out to your primary care provider or Saltzer Urgent Care locations to set up an appointment for a flu vaccine.ACCESSIBILITYDownload Our Mobile Apps: Terms & Conditions Copyright Notices EEO Public File Report FCC Info FCC Applications Public File Assistance Contact News Team Careers Contests FAQ News Weather Sports Politics Idaho Living Game Center Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Do Not Sell or Share Cookie Preferences © 2024 Sinclair, Inc.Flu could be bigger problem in Hong Kong than Covid this winter as experts appeal for children and elderly to be vaccinated against both - Young Post | South China Morning PostdiscovernewsHong KongAsiaEnvironmentGlobalSportslifestyleFeaturesHealth & FitnessTravelFoodentertainmentMoviesTVTech & GamingMusicBooksadvicePersonal developmentLivingMoneyRelationshipsyour voiceOpinionLetters to the EditorsStories & PoemsCompetitionsvideoscmp.comLearnYoung Post is a unit ofSouth China Morning PostOverviewnews+lifestyle+entertainment+advice+your voice+videoscmp.comLearnYPDiscoverNewsHong KongFlu could be bigger problem in Hong Kong than Covid this winter as experts appeal for children and elderly to be vaccinated against bothPublished: 4:49am, 26 Sep, 2022SCMPListen to this article HKU infectious diseases expert says low flu jab rate and lack of exposure because of coronavirus restrictions could fuel outbreaks Government to launch school flu vaccination drive in kindergartens and primary schools on Thursday SCMP | Published: 4:49am, 26 Sep, 2022CommentCopiedLatest ArticlesAsiaClimate changePhilippines hit by fourth typhoon in less than a month4 hours agoHong KongHong Kong’s MTR urges commuters to stand still on escalators5 hours agoFeaturesEthnic minoritiesHow a Hong Kong NGO empowers ethnic minority women with career coaching10 Nov, 2024FeaturesHong KongHong Kong teen uses art to spread joy, advocate for social issues10 Nov, 2024DiscoverDeep Dive and Hot TopicsDeep Dive: Hong Kong’s crackdown on surfing ban leads to confusion10 Nov, 2024ListeningInspiring teensListen Up: Nepali teen becomes youngest to scale world’s 14 tallest peaks10 Nov, 2024Children receive the nasal spray vaccine at Five District Business Welfare Association Cheung Chuk Shan Kindergarten during a press conference on the potential use of nasal spray vaccines for influenza, which could reduce the time and effort spent to inoculate children against the flu. Photo: Sam TsangFlu outbreaks in Hong Kong this winter could be a bigger threat than the coronavirus, a government infectious diseases expert has warned.Professor Ivan Hung Fan-ngai, chief of the infectious diseases division at the University of Hong Kong, on Sunday said that vaccination for children and the elderly against both viruses should be a priority as a surge in flu cases was expected over the next few months.He explained a low influenza jab rate and an increase in cases of the disease arriving from overseas as the city’s anti-coronavirus restrictions were lifted could pose problems.Should Hong Kong’s vaccine pass be extended to include children aged 5-11?Hung said that the population had not been exposed to disease outbreaks that involved upper respiratory tract infections other than Covid-19 over the past two years.“Once children are in contact with it, they can develop relatively severe symptoms and complications,” he said.Hung explained the population’s high coronavirus vaccination rate and natural infection levels had already created a higher level of protection against the coronavirus.BioNTech vaccine for children may be available in Hong Kong by October“The chances of Covid-19 outbreaks are relatively small in the winter. Instead, influenza has a higher chance of outbreaks because society has low levels of antibodies,” Hung, one of the government’s pandemic experts, said.Hung highlighted that Covid-19 after-effects could leave people more vulnerable to flu infection and increased the risk of other medical problems.“Covid-19 has damaged patients’ upper respiratory immunity and they can be easily infected with influenza afterwards … It can be very destructive as there will be a higher chance of complications, in particular pneumonia,” Hung explained.Kids and parents wearing protective face masks queue to receive the Sinovac vaccination at Hong Kong Children’s Hospital in Kai Tak.

Travellers will undergo three days of medical surveillance at home or in a hotel, with limited movement around the city.William Chui Chun-ming, the president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists, added vaccines against the flu and Covid-19 could be given to children at the same time on different arms without causing stronger side-effects, a view backed by experience overseas.(L-R) William Chui Chun-ming, president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists and Professor Ivan Hung Fan-ngai, Chief of Division of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Professor of Department of Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong. Photo: Sam TsangChui said flu vaccines delivered through the nose by schools could be used to increase the inoculation rates among children.He explained nasal vaccines could be used on children who were aged at least two, except for youngsters aged between two and four with asthma and those who had weakened immune systems.“Nasal vaccines can facilitate or enhance the vaccination rate in terms of convenience and painlessness,” Chui said.End of coronavirus pandemic is in sight, WHO chief saysThe government will launch the seasonal influenza vaccination programme for schools on Thursday, with 282,000 injections and 24,000 nasal doses available free of charge.Around 720 kindergartens and child care centres and 460 primary schools have signed up for the scheme.Chui said there were not enough needle-free doses for the schools’ population, but he explained that the government would observe the education sector’s response.He suggested the government should work with schools and increase the supply of nasal vaccines if required.China approves world’s first inhalable Covid-19 vaccineThe Early Childhood Educators Association called for an increase the supply of nasal flu vaccine to kindergartens and primary schools after a survey carried by the organisation in March revealed that half of the staff involved preferred using nasal sprays for influenza inoculation.The survey, which involved more than 150 staff, also found 65 per cent of them agreed that an increased supply of nasal vaccines by the government would increase schools’ participation in inoculation programmes.The association explained that nasal vaccines could reduce the burden on schools as children would be less reluctant to be inoculated and the chance of injuries would be reduced.It added that the alternative delivery method could also cut the time and number of staff needed to administer doses.Sign up for the YP Teachers NewsletterGet updates for teachers sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicyCommentSign up for YP WeeklyGet updates sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicySign up for YP WeeklyGet updates sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy Policydiscovernewslifestyleentertainmentadviceyour voicevideoscmp.comLearnreportTEAM YPjournalism resourceslatest reportslearnlearning resourcescollege & uni lifecareer adviceeventssparkStoriesWorksheetstrending topicsHKDSE - Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary EducationHealth and fitnessEnvironmentalLivingRelationshipsStudent lifeCareersEnglish exercisesVideo gamesK-popMental healthCelebritiesMedia literacye-paperYP is a unit of South China Morning Post.SCMPVisit scmp.comAbout UsContact UsWrite for UsPrivacy PolicyTerms & Conditions© 2024 South China Morning Post Publisher Ltd.

To assist residents, the Burlington County Health Department will once again offer seasonal flu vaccines every Thursday through Jan. 3 at clinics throughout the county. “We’ve spoken a lot about the need for residents to get vaccinated and boosted to help guard against COVID-19 but it’s imperative they also get their seasonal flu shot as well,” said Dr. Herb Conaway, director of the Burlington County Health Department. “Influenza typically sends thousands of people to hospitals annually and can be a danger to anyone, but especially seniors, young children and others with weakened immune systems or other health conditions. Getting a seasonal flu shot is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones.” Burlington County Commissioner Felicia Hopson said the flu clinics ensure every Burlington County resident has access to this important preventative health care. “Burlington County is ranked as one of the healthiest locations in America and one of the big reasons is programs like the Flu Shot Thursday clinics that make sure flu vaccines are easily accessible to everyone,” said Hopson. All 20 flu clinics will be walk-up and open to any individual who is six months or older. The vaccines are available free-of-charge to county residents, but donations are accepted. All residents six-months and older are encouraged to get vaccinated, but health officials stressed the shot is especially important for people who live or work in a nursing home, long-term care facility or health care setting and those who live with or take care of elderly residents or young children or who have chronic health problems. Pregnant women are also advised to get a flu shot. Countries in the southern hemisphere have reported significant increases in flu cases this year, so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning more flu transmission is likely. Health officials are also concerned about the potential for some people to suffer overlapping infections of influenza and COVID-19.“Both the flu shot and the COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are proven to be safe and effective protection against serious illness,” Conaway said. “With COVID variants still active and flu season approaching, there’s a danger of overlapping infections, so it’s important to get both types of shots.” The schedule for upcoming flu clinics is as follows: Sept. 29 10 a.m. to noon New Gretna Fire Company 5 North Maple Ave, New Gretna Oct. 13 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Wrightstown Volunteer Fire Co. 21 Saylors Pond Rd, Wrightstown Oct. 13 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Keegan Center 522 Wood St, Burlington City Oct. 20 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Evesham Fire Dept. 26 East Main St, Evesham Oct. 20 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Palmyra Cove Nature Center 1335 Route 73 South, Palmyra Oct. 27 10 a.m. to noon Palmyra Community Center 30 West Broad St, Palmyra Oct. 27 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Florence Municipal Building 711 Broad St, Florence Oct. 29 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Burlington Twp.

Many southern hemisphere nations have had their most rampant flu season for years. It is largely because people mixed more once Covid restrictions had eased, but had little immunity to the influenza virus after a break from the disease.Health experts are urging anyone who is eligible for a flu shot to get one. After two years with almost zero flu circulating - and all the focus on Covid jabs - there is concern that vaccine fatigue may have set in. Covid cases are starting to rise again in the UK too. 'Autumn wave'UK Health Security Agency chief medical adviser Dr Susan Hopkins told BBC News that Covid cases "looked like they were turning in all four nations in the UK"."We do believe we are starting to see our autumn wave of Covid," she said.NHS director for vaccinations and screening Steve Russell said: "This winter could be the first time we see the effects of the so called 'twindemic' with both Covid and flu in full circulation, so it is vital that those most susceptible to serious illness from these viruses come forward for vaccines in order to protect themselves and those around them."The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says this year's flu jab is a good match for the type of seasonal influenza that is circulating - a strain called H3N2. In Australia, which had a reasonably severe flu season during its winter, the jab was well matched to that strain.It is the same one that caused a bad flu season for the UK in 2017-18. The number of excess deaths that winter in England and Wales exceeded 50,000, external - the highest recorded since the winter of 1975-76 - with around 22,000 thought to be associated with flu. Get booster jab Vaccination can help prevent people getting very sick, and the NHS is offering free flu shots to about 33 million people in the UK this autumn. About 26 million people are also eligible for a free Covid booster to top up their immunity. Covid and flu vaccines are recommended for those at higher risk of illness, which includes: everyone over 50pregnant womenpeople with certain underlying health conditionscare-home residentsfront-line health and social care workersThe UK is using an updated vaccine for the Covid booster, targeting both the original and the Omicron version of the pandemic virus. It is safe to receive the flu shot at the same appointment. Meanwhile, all primary school children and some secondary school children, as well as youngsters aged two or three, can get a free nasal spray flu vaccine. Most young children will not have encountered flu yet. This means they will not have built up any natural immunity to this virus, so it is particularly important for them to take up the flu vaccine this year, say experts.How to get a flu vaccine, externalHow to get a Covid vaccine, externalFind out about flu vaccination for children, externalDr Hopkins said: "I am more worried about flu than I have been for the last few years because of the reduction of immunity that is around."She said there were "strong indications" that the UK could face the threat of widely circulating flu along with new Covid variants that might evade the immune response. "This combination poses a serious risk to our health, particularly those in high-risk groups. So, if you are offered a jab, please come forward to protect yourself."GP surgeries and pharmacies get the flu vaccine in batches throughout the flu season. If you cannot get an appointment straight away, ask if you can book one for when more vaccines are available.Related topicsHealthFluCoronavirusMore on this storyCan I get a free flu jab?Published2 November 2022Who can get an NHS Covid jab this autumn?Published8 OctoberRelated internet linksFlu vaccine - NHSThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 840Top storiesStarmer set for Trump and Ukraine talks with MacronPublished33 minutes agoHouse vote hangs in balance as Trump appoints border tsarPublished1 hour agoEnergy smart meter issues creating north-south dividePublished2 hours agoMore to exploreâI lost nine teeth filming Squid Gameâ: BBC on set with showâs directorThe Papers: Kate's 'solemn duty' and PM to hold talks with MacronEnergy smart meter issues creating north-south divideâCatfish killer used my photo to trap other girlsâMTV EMAs: Eight bits of gossip we uncovered on the nightPower in the Palms: Inside the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago'I was moderating hundreds of horrific and traumatising videos'Will new battery-powered trains replace diesel, and are they safe?'Dying of thirst' as climate-driven floods mix with oilElsewhere on the BBCThe rise and fall of KodakKodak made photography mainstream, so why did it falter in a digital age?A disappearance that has mystified police for 50 yearsIs the son of victim Sandra Rivett about to solve the case of the fugitive aristocrat, Lucan?What will come after the International Space Station?It will be decommissioned in 2030, ending more than three decades of international cooperationSteve Backshall attempts his most extreme challengeThe adventurer embarks on exploring Venezuela's ancient, sheer-sided mountainsMost read1Energy smart meter issues creating north-south divide2House vote hangs in balance as Trump appoints border tsar3Kate's 'solemn duty' and PM to hold talks with Macron4âCatfish killer used my photo to trap other girlsâ5Paddy McGuinness: Chris Hoy training pushed me to 'absolute limits'6âI lost nine teeth filming Squid Gameâ: BBC on set with showâs director7Rita Ora is tearful in tribute to Liam Payne at MTV Awards8Jamie Oliver pulls 'offensive' children's book from sale9Starmer set for Trump and Ukraine talks with Macron10Moscow targeted as Ukraine and Russia trade huge drone attacksBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportEarthReelWorklifeTravelCultureFutureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usÂ© 2024 BBC.

This initial study – featuring a small cohort – found COVID-19 damaged the DNA in cardiac tissue, which wasn’t detected in influenza samples. UQ Diamantina Institute researcher Dr Arutha Kulasinghe said the team found while COVID-19 and influenza are both severe respiratory viruses, they appeared to affect cardiac tissue very differently. “In comparison to the 2009 flu pandemic, COVID has led to more severe and long-term cardiovascular disease but what was causing that at a molecular level wasn’t known,” Dr Kulasinghe said. “During our study, we couldn’t detect viral particles in the cardiac tissues of COVID-19 patients, but what we found was tissue changes associated with DNA damage and repair. “DNA damage and repair mechanisms foster genomic instability and are related to chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders, so understanding why this is happening in COVID-19 patients is important.” Data associated with the impact of COVID on the heart has previously been limited to blood biomarkers and physiological measurement, as obtaining heart biopsy samples is invasive. This study was able to get deeper insights using actual cardiac tissues collected during autopsies from seven COVID patients from Brazil, two people who died from influenza and six control patients. UQ’s Professor John Fraser, who established the international COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium, said the findings provided insights into how COVID-19 impacted the body compared to other respiratory viruses. “When we looked at the influenza cardiac tissue samples, we identified that it caused excess inflammation,” Professor Fraser said. “Whereas we found COVID-19 attacked the heart’s DNA – probably directly and not just as a knock-on from inflammation. “Our study has highlighted that the two viruses appear to affect cardiac tissue very differently, which we want to get a better understand of in larger cohort studies. “What we have categorically shown is that COVID is not ‘just like the flu’. “This study helps us understand how COVID-19 affects that heart, and that is the first step in working out what treatments might be best to repair that heart.” The international team included UQ’s Dr Fernando Guimaraes, Professor Gabrielle Belz and Dr Kirsty Short, Ning Liu and researchers from WEHI, as well as the Critical Care Research Group at the Prince Charles Hospital. The research has been published in Immunology.

Those eligible include all over-50s, those in clinical risk groups, pregnant women and care home residents. Close contacts of the immunocompromised and frontline health and social care workers are also being invited for the vaccine. All primary school and some secondary school children are eligible for the flu vaccine this year, which is given as a nasal spray. Parents have also been urged to bring in children who were two or three-years-old on August 31 for a nasal spray vaccine The UK Health Security Agency has now urged those most at risk — including the over-65s, those with underlying conditions and pregnant women — to come forward for a vaccine.

Share this article Share 319 shares Health chiefs warn Covid will strike at same time as flu this winter Tens of millions of Britons are being urged to rush forward for their Covid and flu jabs amid warnings of a 'twindemic' ahead.Covid cases and hospitalisations are already on the rise in England, in what health chiefs fear is the start of a winter wave.Meanwhile, flu is expected to take off earlier than usual and infect thousands more people after being suppressed by pandemic curbs over the last two winters.Officials today warned that the double-whammy of viruses poses 'a serious risk to our health' and urged people not to be 'complacent'. Around 20,000 people died from Covid last winter, while flu claimed up to 20,000 lives every year before the pandemic.Jabs are both proven to protect against the viruses.Covid's autumn booster campaign opened to 26million over-50s, at-risk groups and health and care staff earlier this month, with 3million jabbed so far.Meanwhile, a similar-sized group — plus millions of healthy children — are set to be offered a seasonal flu jab. Advertisement Will flu REALLY be extra bad this year?Flu's spread has been drastically thwarted over the last two winters, largely due to restrictions brought in to control the spread of Covid.Work from home rules and limits on social mixing stopped flu and other seasonal respiratory viruses from taking off as they usually would.Suppressing the annual cycle has left Britons with less immunity against the virus, scientists say.And the majority of young children — who, unlike for Covid, are one of the risk groups for influenza — have never encountered it in their lifetime.Health chiefs says this leaves the country at risk of more severe illness than usual.Professor Peter Openshaw, an immunologist who sits on the SAGE's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told MailOnline: 'We can't predict exactly [what will happen], but most flu experts are expecting it to be a bad winter season.'Isn't flu just a mild virus? Although usually mild and used as a benchmark to put the impact of Covid into perspective, flu still can be nasty. Sufferers are often bed-bound for a few days with symptoms including a high temperature, body aches, a cough, sore throat and exhaustion.Most people recover on their own. But in severe cases, people — especially the elderly and those with underlying conditions — can be hospitalised and die.Between five and 20 per cent of people are thought to be struck by flu each season, although just three to 11 per cent of these cases are symptomatic. But the virus still poses a threat to some, with health chiefs expecting the virus to trigger a surge in hospital admissions.This would pile more pressure on the already stretched NHS — which is battling staff shortages, a bed-blocking crisis, record poor performance in emergency services and a hospital treatment waiting list of nearly 7million.Between 10,000-20,000 people die from flu each winter, Government data suggest. But officials are worried this year could top that number.Surveillance data shows that the H3N2 flu strain dominant worldwide, meaning it is expected to take off in the UK. It is known to cause more severe illness than other variants.On top of that, being infected with both Covid and flu simultaneously increases the risk of severe illness, hospitalisation and death. Will the flu season last longer? Experts also fear the flu season may last longer and have multiple spikes.It usually runs from October to March and peaks once.Dr John McCauley, director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute in London, told MailOnline that while flu was largely suppressed last year, the season went on for 'much longer than usual' and caused two peaks.He said: 'The season did not finish until about mid-May, rather than late March or early April. 'It might be that this means we set off at the start of the next season at a higher baseline and the season might be early.'And signals from the southern hemisphere — which has already battled through winter — also suggest the flu season will be prolonged and hit more people.Australia confirmed six-times more flu cases than normal at its peak in June. The spike saw some scientists call for a return of Covid-like curbs. Professor Gary McLean, an immunologist from London Metropolitan University, told MailOnline: 'All the indicators are suggesting that this year could be an early and more severe flu season. 'That is based on what happened in the southern hemisphere countries — such as Australia — during their just completed flu season.'Don't we have some immunity?Although the majority of Britons have good levels of immunity against becoming severely unwell with Covid, influenza is a completely different virus.It has its own strains and variants, including H3N2.Covid vaccination rates are very high, with seven in 10 Britons being tripled-jabbed.By contrast, as few as 38 per cent of at-risk groups had a flu jab last year and cases, hospitalisations and deaths were well below average.Professor Openshaw said: 'Most people have not met flu for over two years and the levels of general immunity have declined. 'This is especially important in those most likely to get severe disease, which is why the UKHSA and NHS are extending the range of the vaccination programme this year.' The graph shows the number of GP consultations when the patient complains of an influenza-like illness. It shows that rates were dramatically lower in the years since the pandemic struck The graph shows the number of lab0-confirmed flu cases in Australia. The country confirmed six-times more flu cases than normal at its peak in June. The spike saw some scientists call for a return of Covid-like curbsWhy does it matter that Australia had a bad winter?Australia's experience with the flu acts as a canary in a coalmine for the UK.The country experiences winter, and therefore its annual flu season, while Britain is enjoying its summer.The dominant flu strain, as well as the severity and duration of the wave in Australia, therefore, can act as a model for what could happen in the UK. Professor Openshaw said: 'Normally, what happens in the southern hemisphere is a good predictor of what's about to happen in the northern hemisphere.'Dr Clarke said looking at flu in Australia is 'usually, but not always', a good indicator of what is to come as the virus tends to migrate north as the seasons change.He said: 'This relies on educated guess work, and sometimes things do go according to expectation.'Dr McCauley said: 'Australia’s past season was early, with a large number of detections.'However, he noted that the rise in confirmed cases 'might be because of increased testing due to surveillance for Covid'.Dr McCauley added: 'The description of the season in Australia that I have been told was that it was "moderate". 'It is difficult to quantify when you have flu and Covid around at the same time.'Who can get a flu vaccine?Around 33million Britons can get the flu jab for free.Those eligible include all over-50s, those in clinical risk groups, pregnant women and care home residents.Close contacts of the immunocompromised and frontline health and social care workers are also being invited for the vaccine.Eligible Britons are expected to be offered both jabs at the same appointment — with an injection in each arm — where possible, as was done last year. And all primary school and some secondary school children are eligible for the flu vaccine this year, which is given as a nasal spray.Parents have also been urged to bring in children who were two or three-years-old on August 31 for a nasal spray vaccine. Unlike previous winters, this group is being asked to get the vaccine too.Health chiefs are most concerned about this youngest cohort, as the vast majority have never been infected with flu in their lifetime and the age group drove the flu wave in Australia. When are vaccines being dished out and where can I get one?Flu vaccines are already being dished out to eligible people.Health chiefs are encouraging those groups to come forward for a jab this autumn before the virus starts circulating to get the best protection against it. However, those aged 50 to 64 are being asked to wait until mid-October before booking their appointment, as they are considered the less at risk than other eligible groups. It takes 10 to 14 days after receiving the jab for the body to develop a robust immune response to the virus. GP surgeries and high street pharmacies are dishing out the vaccine on the NHS. Eligible youngsters will be offered the vaccine at school, so don't need to contact their GP or pharmacy.Britons may receive an invitation for the vaccine but do not have to wait for this before they book an appointment. GP surgeries and pharmacies get supplies of the vaccine in batches throughout the flu season.So those who struggle to get an appointment straight away, are encouraged to book one when more vaccines become available. What if I'm not eligible for a flu vaccine?Those who don't fall into the categories listed for a free flu vaccine can still get one from a pharmacy, although they will have to pay for it.This is in comparison to the Covid booster jab, which is only available to eligible groups and cannot be secured privately. Boots kicked off its winter flu jab roll-out this week and has logged the highest ever demand already, with half a million appointments already booked. A fifth are among those not entitled to a free jab, who have to pay £16.99.The pharmacy plans to dish out 2million jabs across almost 2,000 stores and says 75 per cent of slots are still available. Six different vaccines are being used in the flu vaccine rollout. Quadrivalent Infuenza Vaccine, made by French pharmaceutical company Sanof Pasteur, is authorised for everyone over six-months-old. Supemtek, made by the same company, is on offer to all over-18s. FluenzTetra, from Covid vaccine maker AstraZeneca, is available to those aged two to 18 and Infuvac sub-unit Tetra, made by US-based Viatris, is being offered to those aged over six months. Two of Australian flu vaccine maker Seqirus' vaccines are being used — it's Cell-based Quadrivalent Infuenza Vaccine for over-twos and its Adjuvanted Quadrivalent Infuenza Vaccine for over-65sDo the vaccines work? The flu season is unpredictable.But health chiefs study the circulating strains worldwide, especially in the southern hemisphere which experiences winter before the UK. Scientists determine which variant of the flu is likely to cause illness and take off and make vaccines to match them as closely as possible.Quadrivalent jabs are being dished out to protect against four strains, which this year include influenza A subtypes H1N1(pdm09) and H3N2 and both B lineages. Even if the vaccine doesn't perfectly match the strain that eventually takes hold, they still provide some protection against it. Major mismatches don't happen often. Yet the jabs have been just 10 per cent against severe illness in some years, studies have shown.Last year's jabs don't protect against the flu now circulating because the virus mutates so quickly. Professor Openshaw said: '[The vaccines] are very effective in general, but not perfect. 'Sometimes the matching of the vaccine with the circulating strain is not perfect, and vaccines are less effective in people with weak immune responses.'Dr McCauley said the vaccine being offered to Britons this year is a good match with the circulating H3N2 flu strain.'But we cannot know if something new will emerge over the next couple of months,' he noted.What vaccines are being used?Six different vaccines are being used in the flu vaccine rollout.Quadrivalent Infuenza Vaccine, made by French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur, is authorised for everyone over six-months-old.Supemtek, made by the same company, is on offer to all over-18s.FluenzTetra, from Covid vaccine maker AstraZeneca, is available to those aged two to 18 and Infuvac sub-unit Tetra, made by US-based Viatris, is being offered to those aged over six months.Two of Australian flu vaccine maker Seqirus' vaccines are being used — it's Cell-based Quadrivalent Infuenza Vaccine for over-twos and its Adjuvanted Quadrivalent Infuenza Vaccine for over-65s. In some cases people may be able to decide which vaccine they get.For example, children who turn down AstraZeneca's vaccine because it contains porcine gelatine — a substance derived from animals that is used as a stabiliser in some vaccines — will be offered one of the Seqirus vaccines. However, scientists say AstraZeneca's option is more effective.

Here's Why Some May Experience it After Infection While vertigo may be experienced after COVID-19, it has also been reported after cases of influenza and ear infections Published September 28, 2022 • Updated on September 28, 2022 at 6:17 pm As temperatures continue to cool down, health experts are anticipating a rise in both flu and COVID-19 cases in the coming months as more activities shift indoors. With many people recovering from COVID or having recently recovered from COVID, some are wondering about what symptoms may persist and if any new ones may potentially develop. 📺 24/7 Chicago news stream: Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are On Tuesday during a Facebook Live session, Chicago's top doctor Allison Arwady answered a question regarding vertigo, a symptom that has been reported in some while recovering from COVID. Arwady said that while patients may be more likely to develop vertigo while recovering from COVID, the symptom is not specific to the virus and has been linked to other infections during recovery. "We see people after an ear infection, after a flu infection, a number of things can make people more likely to develop vertigo. And so generally, you may be a little more likely to develop vertigo if you've recently recovered from COVID," Arwady said. As for the flu, the season has not "started in any kind of serious way" yet, according to Chicago's top doctor. In the meantime, health experts are warning residents of the symptoms of both the flu and COVID-19 while encouraging vaccination for both. According to Arwady, both viruses have several strains that are active at one time, causing some minor differences in symptoms from one case to another. With COVID symptoms and flu symptoms often being extremely similar, Arwady said there's only one way to know for sure what virus you may have contracted. "Typically people who get influenza tend to have fevers, tend to have body aches, tend to feel like they have been hit by a truck and can feel pretty sick. Of course though, people can also get those with COVID. So the bottom line is, that you need to get a test basically to know for sure," Arwady said. While Chicago health officials currently don't see a noticeable rise in flu cases, information on the spread of the flu is being collected as part of surveillance reports. Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter. Arwady also encouraged accessing the current information and resources the city has collected on the flu at their database. As for COVID-19, the latest BA.5 variant remains the top driver of cases in the United States. New omicron-specific booster shots have recently become readily available, with health officials encouraging widespread inoculation ahead of an expected uptick in cases in the fall and winter months. While upper respiratory symptoms are currently the most tell-tale sign of the virus, some changes in symptoms have been observed as the virus has evolved. "We see a lot of things happening with the virus changing, you know," said Dr. Isaac Ghinai earlier this month, a medical director for the Chicago Department of Public Health who oversees COVID-19 testing and laboratory surveillance. "Omicron and its sub-lineages are an example of the virus changing a bit, and there are indications that different lineages of the virus can cause slightly different symptoms." Ghinai said that differences in symptoms may also be impacted by the introduction of vaccines and their subsequent widespread utilization nearly one year into the pandemic. "There are some indications for example, with omicron that the loss of taste and smell is less common than it was with some of the earlier lineages. All of this is also impacted probably by the fact that many more people are vaccinated than they were before," Ghinai said. Regardless of the changes in symptoms, Ghinai said getting vaccinated and boosted can significantly improve symptoms of the virus if infected. "Certainly, the severity of symptoms if you're vaccinated is much less and the severity of symptoms if you're boosted is even less, so that can kind of change how it looks," Ghinai said. Aug 25, 2022 Chicago's Top Doc, Allison Arwady, Tests Positive for COVID for 1st Time Aug 24, 2022 COVID Antivirals Like Paxlovid ‘Vastly Underused' During Pandemic, Study Says coronavirus illinois Aug 24, 2022 COVID Rebound FAQ's: Information About What it is, its Causes and More As for the symptoms that often stick around the longest? A cough. "That's the thing that's going to last the longest, almost always," Chicago's top doctor Allison Arwady said at a press conference earlier this month. "A cough tends to be the most lingering effect. That's true whenever you have any viral infection. You can be feeling totally better, and you're still going to have some irritation." According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, early symptoms of COVID typically include fatigue, headache, sore throat or a fever. A study by researchers at the University of Southern California found fever may be first, as well as a cough and muscle pain. Then, those infected will likely experience nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Unlike other respiratory illnesses such as MERS and SARS, COVID patients will likely develop nausea and vomiting before diarrhea, the researchers found. Digestive symptoms, in some instances, may be the first sign someone has contracted COVID. They have been known to develop at the beginning of an infection, with respiratory symptoms possibly following a day later, according to an article from Emerson Health. Still, some symptoms, such as shortness of breath, have become less prevalent as the virus continues to mutate. Dr. Sharon Welbel, the director of Hosptial Epidemiology and Infection Control for Cook County Health said earlier this month that fevers and coughs have become more common symptoms in recent months. "In terms of symptoms and what people have it's been so incredibly heterogeneous," Welbel said. "I find with omicron we do know that still the most common is fever, cough - not so much shortness of breath anymore." Experts do caution patients that the severity, or even the type, of initial symptoms can vary widely from person to person. "I think it's really variable depending from person to person," Welbel said. "It depends on age, it depends on comorbid illness, it depends on vaccine status, if one has been infected before potentially their you know, immune system is revved up more... So, I think that there's no way to protect it to predict it." The CDC says that the median time for the appearance of symptoms in a patient with the different lineages of omicron could be just three days. In general, symptoms will typically appear 2-to-14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the CDC. How long they last, however, can depend on the person, the severity of their infection and whether or not they end up with long COVID. "Some people say they feel better in a day, some people say they still have lingering symptoms after three weeks," Welbel said. Symptoms of the virus include: -Fever or chills -Cough -Shortness of breath -Fatigue -Muscle or body aches -Headache -New loss of taste or smell -Sore throat -Congestion or runny nose -Nausea or vomiting -Diarrhea Patients are urged to seek emergency medical attention if they experience: -Trouble breathing -Persistent chest pain or pressure -New confusion -Inability to wake or stay awake -Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds This article tagged under: covid symptoms on now Desde Cero: The Migrant Journey in Chicago Trending Stories Congress Who has control of the House after the 2024 election?

Doctors Say You Have to Test to Make SureIs It COVID-19 or the Flu? Doctors Say You Have to Test to Make SureCoronavirus and influenza are similar, but a simple test can tell you what you have and what your treatment options are.By Korin Miller and Madeleine HaaseUpdated: Sep 28, 2022 3:23 PM EDTSave ArticleNobody loves coming down with a nasty case of the flu. Compared to your typical cold, influenza can really wipe you out, leading to a high fever, deep chest coughs, overwhelming fatigue, and uncomfortable body aches all over. This year’s flu season is predicted to be particularly bad, and similar to the last two years, flu season presents a unique challenge as the novel coronavirus continues to spread throughout the U.S. And while the COVID-19 pandemic could be considered an “endemic” at this point, plenty of new cases are still showing up every day, and experts are expecting a surge in the coming winter months. Both the flu and COVID-19 are expected to put a strain on our healthcare system during the colder months, and unfortunately, it’s difficult to tell the two apart because the symptoms can be nearly identical. “Both influenza and coronavirus are very dangerous,” says Rajeev Fernando, M.D., an infectious disease expert in Southampton, New York. “We have to be careful and concerned about both of them.”Here’s what doctors know about how COVID-19 compares to the flu so far, which symptoms may present differently, and how to stay healthy. COVID-19 symptoms vs. flu symptomsThomas_EyeDesign//Getty ImagesThere’s a lot of overlap in symptoms between these two illnesses. But these are the main symptoms of COVID-19 to keep on your radar, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting DiarrheaSymptoms can appear between two and 14 days after a person is infected, the CDC says. The CDC lists these as the major symptoms of the flu:Fever or feeling feverish/chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue (tiredness) Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea (although it’s more common in children than adults)The flu comes on fast, typically one to four days after you have been infected. Keep in mind that not everyone with the flu develops a fever, but it is still common.While both the flu and COVID-19 are believed to spread from person-to-person via respiratory droplets after a person talks, coughs, or sneezes, the CDC says COVID-19 is more contagious and has established more “super-spreading” events.How do you know if your symptoms are due to COVID-19 or the flu?It’s really difficult to tell the difference between the two, even for doctors. “The early symptoms of influenza and COVID can be identical,” Dr. Fernando says. “Covid and the flu cause similar illnesses and it is not possible to reliably distinguish them based on symptoms,” says Richard Watkins, M.D., an infectious disease physician and professor of medicine at the Northeast Ohio Medical University. Only testing someone for the flu and COVID-19 can accurately determine the illness they are dealing with, says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “Without a test, we just don’t know for sure,” he says. If you feel sick and you test negative for Covid, you can also get tested for the flu, says Dr. Watkins. “There are many other viruses that cause respiratory infections referred to as ‘influenza-like illness’,” so it’s best to know what you have so you can know the best course of treatment.Is COVID-19 more deadly than the flu? It’s important to note that both COVID-19 and the flu are dangerous illnesses. According to preliminary data from the CDC, anywhere between 5,000 to 14,000 people died of the flu during the 2021-2022 season, much lower than previous years thanks to mask-wearing and social distancing. CDC data also found that, as of Sept. 21, more than 1,050,800 Americans have died of COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.Based on these numbers alone, COVID-19 is currently more deadly than the flu. “There’s no question: COVID-19 is more dangerous than the flu in terms of lethality,” Dr. Russo says. “Our defenses to COVID-19 are really minimal when compared to influenza, which most people have been exposed to already.” “There’s no question: COVID-19 is more dangerous than the flu in terms of lethality.” How are COVID-19 and the flu treated?For mild cases of both illnesses, doctors recommend supportive care if you’re not hospitalized. That means staying home, getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and taking fever reducing medications like Tylenol until your symptoms start to improve. The flu is generally treated with antiviral drugs to help make the course of illness milder and shorten the time you are sick, the CDC says. Those medications include: oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), peramivir (Rapivab), and baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza).With the flu, healthy people usually don’t have trouble recovering. Those in higher-risk groups may develop complications, including sinus or ear infections, pneumonia, bronchitis, sepsis, lung damage, and more—some of which can be deadly.If you test positive for COVID, CDC recommends isolating yourself from others for 5 days, or until you test negative. Depending on whether or not you have more severe symptoms, check these CDC guidelines for everything you need to know about protecting others while you are still infectious.There are some options available for COVID treatment, the most relevant being Paxlovid, Pfizer’s Covid-19 pill. However, Paxlovid is typically only suggested for use in high risk patients, says Amesh Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.With COVID-19, even healthy people have reported having a hard time recovering. Certain coronavirus patients may experience symptoms for months after “recovering” from the virus, a condition known as long COVID, which is why getting vaccinated and protecting yourself, and others, from the virus is so important.How to protect yourself from COVID and the fluExperts stress the importance of getting your flu shot. “The first thing to do is to get vaccinated,” Dr. Schaffner stresses. The CDC recommends that everyone over the age of six months get a flu shot by the end of October, so your body has enough time to build up immunity to the circulating strains.Even though the flu shot is not always 100% effective, it can help a person be less contagious and less sick if they do come down with a case, minimizing the risk of severe side effects. As for COVID-19, the COVID vaccines and the follow-up boosters have proven effective against contracting the virus and effective against severe illness, hospitalization, and death. According to the CDC, third and fourth doses, aka boosters, offered substantial protection among adults with healthy immune systems. If you have not yet received your first round of COVID vaccine shots, the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself, and others, from getting seriously sick. If you have received the first round of shots (and perhaps a booster or two), you may also be eligible for the new Omicron booster, specifically designed to protect against the latest slew of Omicron variants that have spread throughout the last year. There’s a lot of recommended vaccines to get this season, and we know scheduling all those appointments can be a hassle. Luckily, doctors say that if you’re eligible for the new Omicron booster, you can go ahead and get your flu shot and the booster in the same sitting. Fair warning though: your arms might be slightly more sore than you bargained for!On top of getting vaccinated, Dr. Schaffner Other than that, he recommends continuing all of the things you should already be doing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in your area. “These things will protect not only against COVID-19, but also against influenza,” Dr. Schaffner says. That includes the following:Social distancing from people outside of your householdWearing a face mask in publicWashing your hands for at least 20 seconds frequentlyUsing hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when you’re in a pinchDisinfecting high-touch surfaces in your homeCovering a sneeze or cough with a tissueAvoiding unnecessary travel Avoiding large gatherings Seeing a doctor if you develop symptomsThe bottom lineExperts are predicting a bad flu season, says Dr. Watkins. “I strongly encourage people to get vaccinated against both the flu and Covid. The benefits of these vaccines far outweigh the risks.” To find a COVID vaccine near you, go to https://www.vaccines.gov/.

You can take preventive measures - such as washing your hands and staying away from people who are sick - but when it comes to lowering your risk of getting the flu during pregnancy, vaccination is the best way to protect yourself. Experts at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and many other organizations agree. Pregnant women are more likely to develop complications from the flu, such as pneumonia, which can be dangerous for both mom and baby. But pregnant women who get flu shots are 40 percent less likely to be hospitalized for the flu.Advertisement | page continues below Note: The nasal spray flu vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women because it contains a tiny amount of weakened live virus. Will the flu shot protect my baby from the flu? It can. Antibodies that you develop during pregnancy in response to the flu shot are passed to your baby. And those antibodies will provide protection from the flu for several months after birth. That protection can be vital because babies younger than 6 months are especially vulnerable to complications but are too young to be vaccinated against the illness. Researchers found that babies born to women who've been vaccinated against the flu have a 63 percent lower risk of getting the illness before they're 6 months old compared to infants born to women who didn't get flu shots. Is there any danger of catching the flu from the flu vaccine? No - there's no chance. Flu shots don't contain the live virus, which is the only thing that can cause the flu. Flu shots contain fragments of killed influenza virus, which stimulate your body to produce antibodies that protect you from the live virus. But the influenza virus in the flu shot is inactive, so it can't infect you. The nasal spray flu vaccine, FluMist, contains live viruses, but they're weakened and can't survive the warm temperature in your lungs. Still, as a precaution, it's recommended that you get the shot instead of the spray during pregnancy. How effective is the flu shot? The effectiveness of the flu shot can vary from year to year. That's because the vaccine (which is reformulated each year) needs to match the strains of flu viruses that are most common that season. So, a bit of predicting is involved.Advertisement | page continues below According to the CDC, when the vaccine is well-matched to the circulating viruses, the risk of flu illness is reduced by 40 to 60 percent among the overall population. Even if you get the flu, it's likely to be much less severe if you've been vaccinated. For pregnant women, the flu shot reduces the risk of hospitalization with flu by 40 percent, and the risk of getting a lung infection as a result of the flu by about half. Video Should I get the flu shot and the COVID-19 vaccine while pregnant? Yes, you need protection against both COVID-19 and the flu, and it's important that you get both vaccines. You can get them at the same time. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for pregnant women. Women who get COVID-19 during pregnancy are at higher risk for severe illness and pregnancy complications than non-pregnant women. And as with the flu vaccine, getting vaccinated for COVID-19 during pregnancy provides your baby with protective antibodies against the COVID-19 virus, including variants. When should I get the flu shot? You need a flu shot every year, even if you've had one in previous years, because different strains of flu surface each year.Advertisement | page continues below No matter which trimester you're in, get the flu vaccine when it becomes available – preferably by the end of October, so you're protected before flu season begins. (It takes about two weeks for your body to make antibodies.) But if you miss getting a shot in the fall, it's still worth getting vaccinated afterward because the flu season can last into May. Is it safe to get a flu shot at the pharmacy when you're pregnant? Yes. While you can most likely get the shot from your healthcare provider at a prenatal visit, you can safely get a flu shot anywhere it's offered to adults, including pharmacies and drive-through clinics. If you can't find one, call your local health department to find out where the flu shot is available in your community. You don't need a referral or special permission from your healthcare provider to get a flu vaccine while you're pregnant. Because of COVID-19, some pharmacies have extra safety measures in place. You may be asked a few COVID screening questions and the pharmacist or technician may take your temperature. You'll likely have your shot in a screened area for privacy. So, if it's more convenient for you to go to the pharmacy than the doctor's office for your shot, that's a perfectly fine alternative. What are the possible side effects of the flu vaccine? Side effects from the flu shot are usually mild. Common ones can include:Advertisement | page continues below Soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site Headache Muscle aches Fever Nausea Fainting If you do have side effects, they usually begin soon after you get the shot, and may last a day or two. As with any vaccine, severe allergic reactions are very rare but possible. Signs of serious allergic reaction can include: Breathing problems Hoarseness or wheezing Hives Paleness Weakness Fast heartbeat Dizziness Severe reactions usually develop within a few minutes to a few hours after you get the shot. Call 911 if you start having any symptoms of a serious reaction.Advertisement | page continues below Remember, side effects of the flu vaccine are rare, and the complications associated with getting the flu in pregnancy can be much more serious. Does the flu vaccine contain thimerosal? Some flu vaccines that are stored in multidose vials prior to being drawn for a single-dose flu shot contain thimerosal (a preservative that contains a type of mercury) to safeguard against contamination of the vial. Most single-dose vials and prefilled syringes of the flu vaccine and the nasal spray flu vaccine don't contain preservatives because they're intended to be used once. The CDC considers thimerosal safe for pregnant women and their developing babies, but if you'd like to get a thimerosal-free vaccine, they're usually available. Just ask your doctor or pharmacist. Who shouldn't get the flu shot? Don't get a flu vaccine if you've had a severe allergic reaction to a flu shot in the past. If you're allergic to eggs, talk with your healthcare provider. (Chicken eggs are used as a culture for growing the flu virus that's used in most vaccines.) If you only get hives (rather than a severe reaction) after exposure, you can probably still get the flu shot. If you have a serious allergic reaction to eggs, you have two options:Advertisement | page continues below You can get the vaccine under medical supervision (that is, in your doctor's office). You can ask for one of the influenza vaccines that are egg-free. Two of these "cell-based" vaccines are now available. Before getting a flu shot, be sure to let your healthcare provider know if you have any other severe allergies, or if you've had the immune disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome.

From: UK Health Security Agency Published 28 September 2022 The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is urging everyone eligible for a free flu vaccine and a COVID-19 booster to take up the offer as soon as possible ahead of what could be a difficult winter with respiratory viruses circulating widely. International surveillance shows that H3N2 – a subtype of influenza type A – is currently the most-commonly detected flu virus worldwide. H3N2 has recently caused waves of infection in southern hemisphere countries such as Australia, which has also experienced flu circulating earlier than usual in their winter season. This H3N2 strain circulated in the UK last winter but was held largely in check by COVID-19 restrictions when people mixed a lot less and worked from home. This helped to protect people from catching flu but has also led to lower levels of natural immunity to this strain building up within the population. There was record uptake of the flu jab in people aged 65 and over in 2021 and 2022 (82%), though there was lower uptake among people in clinical risk groups and pregnant women and these groups are particularly encouraged to come forward this year. All primary school children and some secondary school children are eligible for the flu nasal spray this year, which is usually given at school. GP surgeries are also inviting children aged 2 and 3 years old (age on 31 August) for this nasal spray vaccination at their practices. Most young children will not have encountered flu yet. This means they will not have built up any natural immunity to this virus, so it is particularly important for them to take up the flu vaccine this year. In addition to the predicted flu wave, we have early indications that COVID-19 rates are beginning to rise ahead of winter, increasing the threat to people’s health. Study results from early in the pandemic show individuals who catch both flu and COVID-19 at the same time, known as co-infection, are around twice as likely to suffer death compared to those who only have COVID-19. For all those who are eligible, taking up both the COVID-19 booster and the flu jab is an essential form of protection against the most severe respiratory viruses in circulation this winter. As well as taking up the vaccines, everyone is encouraged to help stop the spread of respiratory viruses this winter by practising good hand hygiene, wearing masks in crowded or enclosed public spaces and covering your nose and mouth when you cough and sneeze. Dr Susan Hopkins, Chief Medical Advisor at UKHSA, said: Flu and COVID-19 are unpredictable but there are strong indications we could be facing the threat of widely circulating flu, lower levels of natural immunity due to less exposure over the last three winters and an increase in COVID-19 circulating with lots of variants that can evade the immune response. This combination poses a serious risk to our health, particularly those in high-risk groups. The H3N2 flu strain can cause particularly severe illness. If you are elderly or vulnerable because of other conditions you are at greater risk, so getting the flu jab is a sensible, potentially life-saving thing to do. We are extremely fortunate to have vaccines against these two diseases Most eligible groups have been selected because they are at higher risk of severe illness. Younger children are unlikely to have built up any natural immunity to flu and therefore it is particularly important they take the nasal spray vaccine this year. So, if you are offered a jab, please come forward to protect yourself and help reduce the burden on our health services. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Thomas Waite said: Vaccines have saved many lives over the years for both flu and more recently COVID-19. But we must not be complacent – infections will rise once again this winter, so it’s really important people get both their COVID-19 and flu vaccines if eligible. Vaccines are the best way to protect yourself from serious illness and will help reduce pressure on the healthcare system. NHS director for vaccinations and screening Steve Russell said: This winter could be the first time we see the effects of the so called ‘twindemic’ with both COVID-19 and flu in full circulation, so it is vital that those most susceptible to serious illness from these viruses come forward for vaccines in order to protect themselves and those around them. If you have been offered a flu vaccination or COVID-19 booster you should book in as soon as possible and with more vaccination centres than ever before this year, they are quick, convenient and will provide vital protection this winter.

Next Ag News More cases of Avian Influenza showing up on the Prairies Written by Glenda-Lee Vossler Tuesday, Sep 27 2022, 11:45 AM Share: Copied! Article continues below advertisement ↴ The migration of wild birds this fall has resulted in a return of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza or "bird flu" showing up across the prairies. Producers are encouraged to take active measures by preventing contact between poultry and wild birds, limiting visitors to barns, using barn-specific clothing and footwear, and regularly monitoring birds for signs of illness. The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza has had a major impact on the poultry industry with an estimated 1.2 million birds in commercial poultry operations in Alberta being infected. The CFIA's website on the ongoing status of avian influenza response by province puts the estimated number of birds in flocks impacted in Saskatchewan at 315,000 birds and 35,000 birds in Manitoba. Alberta is currently dealing with 12 cases, while Manitoba and Saskatchewan each have five. Saskatchewan's Chief Veterinary Officer Dr. Stephanie Smith has issued an Animal Health Order until October 21st prohibiting the movement and participation of birds in shows, auctions, and agricultural fairs, as well as any other events where birds would be brought together from multiple locations. "This order is specifically preventing the transport and comingling of poultry at things like poultry shows and sales. Any of those types of events where we're going to have birds coming from various flocks and coming together in one area and potentially spreading disease. So, the purpose of that is really to try and limit that spread of disease, because if you did have a flock that was infected, you came into contact with a number of others, of course, we're going to see that disease spread and that risk to other flocks." There's also been numerous detections in wildlife as well with people being encouraged to look at their provincial Ministry of Environment websites, or Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative for more information on wildlife species.

Photo courtesy of Medical One. MADELINE SMITH | STAFF REPORTER | mgsmith1@butler.edu Butler is hosting a four-day-long flu shot clinic from Oct. 4 through Oct. 8 at the Health and Recreation Complex, HRC. Medical professionals from Employer Wellness Solutions Indiana will travel to campus to administer the shots. While walk-in appointments will be accepted, students are encouraged to schedule an appointment ahead of time through the scheduling system. Costs will be billed directly to the student’s insurance provider. Students have to bring a copy of their health insurance card to their appointment. Director of Health Services Maxie Gardner said the university expects to see at least 50% of the student population at the clinic. She said Butler hopes to see as many students, staff and faculty as possible every time a health initiative takes place on campus. She said the clinic is convenient for students, and that it will help reduce instances of influenza on campus. “We do provide some privacy during that clinic also, even though it takes place in an open area,” Gardner said. “We have curtains that staff put up, so you have privacy. It truly is just one easy way that you can take care of your health and not get the flu.” Sophomore psychology major Sarah Glasser plans to receive her shot at one of the upcoming clinics. Glasser said even though it is a small act, she hopes it keeps campus slightly safer. “It’s important to stay vaccinated,” Glasser said. “Vaccines help and if I can stay even a little bit healthier because of them, then yeah, I’m going to get one.” In the United States, for the 2019-20 flu season, there were an estimated 35 million flu-related illnesses, 16 million medical visits for the flu, 380,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 20,000 deaths due to influenza. People with the flu can spread it to others by coughing, sneezing and talking. The infected droplets are easily transmitted and inhaled into the lungs, passing it on to others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, said the influenza vaccination protects from contracting the flu, while also reducing the severity of the illness in people who are vaccinated and still catch the flu. First-year international business major Colin Weber believes that offering the clinic is a great way to keep campus healthy, while also allowing students to do what is best for their personal well-being. “It’s great that we go to a school where the option is available to those who want it and maybe don’t have access to it otherwise,” Weber said.

Home/Featured/Avian Influenza hits Irish seabird coloniesAvian Influenza hits Irish seabird coloniesCalvin JonesSeptember 25, 20220 commentsHighly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI H5N1) has hit Irish seabird colonies this breeding season after running rampant through similar colonies in the UK earlier this year. The disease, which can infect a wide range of bird species, appears to have hit breeding Gannet colonies particularly hard.Report Dead or Sick BirdsAn outbreak of Avian Influenza (H5N1) has hit Gannet populations particularly hard in 2022 Gannets, our larges seabird, nest in dense colonies on uninhabited offshore islands numbering tens of thousands of birds. Unfortunately these mass gatherings, with birds crammed in close proximity, provide an ideal environment for transmission of a virus like H5N1 . There are three main gannet breeding colonies in Ireland: a large colony on Great Saltee off the Wexford coast, a much smaller colony on the Bull Rock off the Beara Peninsula in West Cork and one of the world’s largest Gannet colonies on Little Skellig, off County Kerry, which hosts almost 30,000 pairs of this iconic seabird each summer.Seabirds, wildfowl (geese, ducks and swans) and moreDead and dying Gannets are being reported from around Irish coasts this year, along with some other seabirds like Guillemots and Razorbills in smaller numbers. But it is not just seabirds that are affected by H5N1 — any bird that comes into contact with other infected birds could catch and carry the disease. Wildfowl (ducks, geese and swans) and birds of prey are particularly susceptible, as are birds like corvids (the crow family) that could come into contact with the disease through scavenging infected carcasses.To date there have been no reported cases in Ireland relating to garden birds, which are highly unlikely to come into direct contact with vectors of the disease. The risk posed by feeding your garden birds is considered minimal.While H5N1 is predominantly an avian disease, and only spreads easily through bird populations, some mammals, including humans in very rare cases, may be susceptible to infection.What should you do if you find a sick birdAlthough the risk of the disease passing from a wild bird to a human host is extremely low, authorities recommend that the general public avoid all contact with sick or dead wild birds at this time.DO NOT TOUCH sick or dead wild birdDO NOT attempt to help sick wild birds, bring them home, or take them to an animal rescue centreDO NOT allow pets to approach sick or dead wild birds. Keep dogs on a lead in areas where dead or sick birds are present.DO report any dead or sick seabirds, wildfowl (ducks, geese or swans), corvids (crows) and birds of prey through the Official Department of Agriculture web portal here.Report Dead or Sick BirdsAlternatively, you can call the Department’s Avian Influenza hotline to report potential cases of the disease on 01 6072512 during office hours or 01 4928026 outside office hours.Other Irish Avian Influenza ResourcesBelow you’ll find links to other Irish Avian Influenza resources on the web — we’ll keep this list updated as we discover relevant new links:Avian Influenza update from Birdwatch IrelandAvian Influenza Public Notice from the National Parks and Wildlife ServiceAvian Influenza Public Safety Information from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the MarineAvian Influenza general information on Gov.ieBook Review: Ireland’s Wild Orchids, A Field GuideAugust 23, 2013Ireland's orchids are a fascinating group of plants, and are among our most beautiful and evocative wildflowers.

Skip to content Good Things Guy People Environment Fun Business Lifestyle Travel Sport Opinion Charity Lists Mega Menu More Menu Search Search for: Menu Good Things Guy Search Search for: About Us Contact The Good Things Guy Get Involved Submit a Story Order Book More Over 100 African Penguins Released at De Hoop Nature Reserve! by Brent Lindeque@BrentLindequeOctober 1, 2022October 29, 2024 497 0 Photo Credit: Jean van der Meulen from Pexels Since the first release, five other groups of penguins have been released, 148 birds in total! Western Cape, South Africa (01 October 2022) – In an attempt to re-establish an African Penguin colony at the De Hoop Nature Reserve, South Africa, BirdLife South Africa, CapeNature and the Southern African Foundation For The Conservation Of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB) have released over 100 juvenile penguins at the reserve over the past two years. African Penguin numbers have declined by over 60% in the last 30 years, mainly due to a lack of food. In response, BirdLife South Africa partnered with CapeNature and SANCCOB to create a new breeding colony for African Penguins in an area of high fish abundance. The chosen site, at the De Hoop Nature Reserve, was the location of a short-lived penguin colony in the early 2000s, which was abandoned due to predation by caracal. Since 2018, a predator-proof fence has been installed to make the site safe for penguins to breed. The first phase of the project involved the use of life-like penguin decoys and a speaker playing penguin calls to trick penguins into thinking a colony already existed there. After two years of attempting to attract the penguins naturally, the next step was to release juvenile penguins at the site. “We released the first group of 30 penguins in June 2021. It was a very exciting day and was an important step in the progression of the project,” says Christina Hagen, the Pamela Isdell Fellow of Penguin Conservation at BirdLife South Africa, the project leader. The released penguins come from existing colonies, mostly from CapeNature’s Stony Point Nature Reserve at Betty’s Bay. They were abandoned by their parents as eggs or chicks and subsequently hand-reared by SANCCOB, a world leader in seabird rehabilitation. “We need to release young penguins as they still need to choose a breeding colony. Once a penguin breeds somewhere, they are unlikely to move to a different colony, so the key is to get the young penguins to imprint on the De Hoop site,” says Dr David Roberts, Clinical Veterinarian at SANCCOB. Since the first release, five other groups of penguins have been released, 148 birds in total. The last three groups have been released after spending the night in a pen on the beach to familiarise them with the area. Once released, they leave the colony site and are expected to spend the next few years at sea, learning how to fend for themselves and prospecting at different colonies. It was during the last release that an exciting discovery was made. After the penguins had been released, David Roberts came back from his vantage point where he’d watched the birds going to sea and found an adult penguin under a boulder. On further inspection, it looked like an adult that may have recently moulted (replaced all of its feathers). After looking around the area cautiously, the team found two more adult penguins showing no signs of moulting. “I almost couldn’t believe my eyes and had to make sure they weren’t decoys! This is such a positive moment for the project. While we don’t know if the penguins will stay and breed, it is a very encouraging sign,” says Hagen.
