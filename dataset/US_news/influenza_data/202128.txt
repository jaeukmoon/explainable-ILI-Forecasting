Fitting a statistical model to those distributions using surveillance data from New Zealand, we found they could be explained by historical changes in lineage frequencies combined with cross-protection between strains of the same lineage. We found additional protection against B/Yamagata in people for whom it was their first influenza B infection, similar to the immune imprinting observed in influenza A. While the data were not informative about B/Victoria imprinting, B/Yamagata imprinting could explain the fewer B/Yamagata than B/Victoria cases in cohorts born in the 1990s and the bimodal age distribution of B/Yamagata cases. Longitudinal studies can test if these forms of protection inferred from historical data extend to more recent strains and other populations.

However, many pathogens can infect the same host multiple times due to the circulation of antigenically distinct strains in the population. Changes in the prevalences of strains over time can lead to different infection histories in hosts born at different times, and such differences in infection history can lead to complicated age distributions of infection4,5,6. Influenza viruses, for instance, circulate as antigenically distinct variants, including the types A and B, subtypes of influenza A, lineages of influenza B, and clades within them. Changes in variant prevalence over time generate different infection histories that are correlated across birth cohorts7,8,9, but how differences in infection history affect protection and shape the age distribution of influenza virus infections is not fully understood.Early childhood infections with influenza A have long-lasting consequences for protection against influenza A subtypes, a phenomenon termed “immune imprinting”10,11,12. Subtypes are distinguished by their surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), with HA subtypes clustered into the major phylogenetic groups 1 (including, among others, H1, H2, and H5) and 2 (including H3 and H7). Different subtypes of influenza A have circulated in the twentieth century7 and protection against severe infection and death is higher against subtypes whose HAs are genetically similar to the HA of the subtype with which a person was likely first infected10,11,12. For instance, early infection with H1N1 or H2N2 is associated with lifelong protection against severe infections with not only H1N1 but also H5N1, and early H3N2 infection protects against severe infection with H7N9 as well as H3N2. Subtypes H1N1 and H2N2 were the only subtypes circulating between 1918 and 1968, and H3N2 has been more common than H1N1 since 1968. Thus, the age distributions of clinical infections with H1N1 and H5N1 skew young, and the distributions of H7N9 and H3N2 infections skew old, because of the lasting impact of childhood immunity to the first HA encountered10,11,12.Despite its durability, imprinting protection does not completely prevent re-infection with the same subtype, and models based on imprinting protection alone cannot completely recapitulate the age distribution of cases11,12. Longitudinal analyses of antibody titers, which reveal subclinical infections, suggest that protection after infection with influenza type A decreases significantly within 3.5–7 years13,14. Repeated clinical infections of the same subtype have been observed in the same person15,16,17,18 and are likely enabled by antigenic evolution of HA and NA, which experience strong positive selection19,20,21,22. Thus, protection against infection with a subtype appears to depend not only on imprinting protection (early infection with a subtype) but also cross-protection from recent infections with that subtype. This cross-protection can be sensitive to the precise strains with which a person was infected, apparent as birth cohort effects and reproducible in animal models13,23,24,25.Similar to the different subtypes of influenza A, the two lineages of influenza type B have distinct age distributions of medically attended infections. The B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages diverged in the early 1980s8,26 and have circulated with varying frequencies since, causing 25% of global influenza cases detected in 2000–201827. While the incidence of medically attended infections is highest in children for both lineages, B/Yamagata appears less common than B/Victoria in teenagers and young adults but the pattern reverses in older age groups. This pattern has been observed in surveillance from the 2000s and 2010s in Oceania28, East Asia29, Europe30,31, and North America32. It has also been observed in isolates from sequence databases33. Changes with age in the expression of sialic acid receptors have been proposed to explain the lower mean age of B/Victoria cases28, but this explanation does not account for the higher frequency of B/Yamagata cases in middle-aged people.Alternatively or in addition to physiological changes, differences in cohorts’ susceptibility to influenza B lineages might arise from differences in cohorts’ infection histories. It is unclear whether people have increased protection against their first infecting influenza B lineage. One hypothesized mechanism for immune imprinting in influenza A is antibodies to conserved epitopes10,11,12,34,35. As B/Victoria and B/Yamagata diverged from each other more recently8,26,36 and evolve antigenically much more slowly than the influenza A subtypes22,28,37, conserved epitopes within a lineage might also be conserved between lineages, leading to strong cross-lineage protection by antibodies targeting those epitopes, regardless of which lineage was encountered first. Alternatively, cross-lineage protection may be weak or asymmetrical, with downstream consequences for the age distribution of medically attended cases.To investigate how protection might arise from infections with B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, and contribute to differences in their age distributions, we fitted a statistical model to medically attended influenza B cases recorded by systematic surveillance in New Zealand from 2001 to 2019 (Fig. 1). The model used the estimated historical frequencies of the lineages to estimate the probabilities of different infection histories and the strength of within- and cross-lineage protection from previous infections. We found that differences in birth cohorts’ susceptibility to each lineage are consistent with strong cross-protection between strains of the same lineage. In addition to within-lineage protection independent of the order of infection, we found evidence of protection against B/Yamagata in people for whom it was the first influenza B infection, whereas the strength of a similar effect for B/Victoria could not be estimated from the data. This imprinting protection against B/Yamagata can explain why cohorts born in the 1990s, when B/Yamagata appears to have been the only lineage circulating in New Zealand, have since had fewer B/Yamagata cases than B/Victoria cases and fewer B/Yamagata cases than older birth cohorts. We found similar support for B/Yamagata imprinting in data from other regions where B/Yamagata was dominant during the 1990s but not in data from China, where B/Victoria was present during that time9. These results suggest that long-lasting protection from early infections, previously shown for the subtypes and groups of influenza A, also shapes the age distributions of the more recently diverged influenza B lineages.Fig. 1: Historical frequencies and age distributions of the influenza B lineages.a Distribution of medically attended influenza B cases in New Zealand in 2001–2019 by age (in years) of the infected person. b Frequency of B/Yamagata estimated from sequences deposited on GISAID and the NCBI Influenza Virus Database. Frequencies were estimated for New Zealand and Australia combined to increase power. The circles are annotated with the number of isolates used to estimate frequencies in each season. In 2001 and 2003, when both lineages were known to be circulating in Australia and New Zealand but the number of isolates from those countries combined were small, we estimated lineage frequencies using isolates from all countries represented in the sequence databases. c Distribution of medically attended influenza B cases in New Zealand in 2001–2019 by birth year of the infected person. In a and c, the fraction of cases was calculated relative to all cases observed for each lineage (including ages and birth years not shown in the figure).Full size imageResultsStatistical model of influenza B cases by birth yearTo test how age, early infections, and protection within and between lineages might shape the distribution of influenza B cases, we fitted a statistical model to medically attended infections detected by influenza surveillance from 2001 to 2019 in New Zealand (Methods: “Case data,” Fig. 1, and Supplementary Fig. 1). Data from 2002 to 2013 were previously analyzed by Vijaykrishna et al.28.Most of the data (60% of the 4036 cases identified at the level of the influenza B lineage) were collected by general practices as part of a surveillance program with well-defined sampling criteria independent of the patient’s age38, thus approximating the true age distribution of medically attended infections. The remaining cases were sampled without consistent criteria from hospital samples, mostly inpatient. We performed the main analyses on the entire New Zealand data set but assessed the effect of removing the non-surveillance data and fitting the model only to the general practice surveillance data. In addition to the New Zealand data, we analyzed age distributions from two data sets with unclear sampling criteria: Australian hospital samples compiled by ref. 28 and influenza B isolates from other countries that were submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database.Following work on influenza A10,11,12, the model describes the probability that a case occurs in each birth cohort (Fig. 2 and Methods: “Statistical model of influenza B susceptibility based on infection history”). These probabilities are based on the following:Fig. 2: Statistical model of influenza B infections by birth year.Extending the model developed by Gostic et al.10, for each influenza B season we predicted the fraction of cases observed in each cohort based on cohort-specific infection histories and on additional factors. The probabilities of the different infection histories in Table 1 are derived in the “Methods” using a discrete-time probabilistic model of infection. As an example, the diagram shows how the probability that a person is first infected with B/Yamagata depends on the frequency of B/Yamagata in the years after birth. Given a person’s first influenza B infection occurs in a particular year, we assumed that the probability this infection was caused by a particular lineage is equal to the frequency of the lineage in that year. We obtained the total probability of being first infected with a particular lineage by summing across all possible years when the first influenza B infection might have occurred. The susceptibility of each cohort is then calculated as a weighted sum of the susceptibilities associated with each infection history. In addition to infection history, other factors that affect the fraction of cases observed in a birth cohort include the cohort’s size relative to the total population and the effect of age itself (rather than year of birth) on infection risk and on the probability that an infection receives medical attention and becomes a case. We fitted the model by maximum likelihood assuming the distributions of cases by birth year in different seasons were independent multinomial draws.Full size image 1. Demography. The fraction of the total population that belongs to a birth cohort gives a baseline probability that a case occurs in that cohort. We obtained those fractions from demographic data for New Zealand (Methods: “Demographic data”). 2. Age-specific effects on infection risk. We assumed that preschoolers (0–5 years old), school-age children and teenagers (6–17 years old), and people 18 years and older had different baseline probabilities of infection, representing differences in exposure and susceptibility related with age itself and not infection history. These baseline probabilities were then modified by protection from previous infections. We compared the estimates for the preschool and school-age infection probabilities with independent estimates. 3. Age-specific effects on reporting. We assumed infections in children younger than 2 years old had a different probability of receiving medical attention, and thus being reported as a case, than infections in the rest of the population (estimates of protection were similar when we assumed this effect applied to children younger than 5 years). We estimated this differential reporting from the case data. 4. Infection history. The probability of observing a case of a lineage in a birth cohort could be modified by the average susceptibility of people in that cohort to that lineage, based on the birth cohort’s infection history. Susceptibility is defined as the probability of infection given exposure, relative to that of a naive person. We estimated the probabilities of different infection histories for each birth cohort using a discrete-time model in which the probability of becoming infected with either lineage depends on the lineages’ historical frequencies (Methods: “Infection history probabilities”), which we estimated using sequence databases (Methods: “Historical frequencies of influenza B lineages”). Consistent with historical surveillance and with trends observed in other countries outside East Asia9, we found that B/Yamagata was the only lineage circulating in New Zealand in the 1990s, although this observation was based on few isolates. B/Victoria started circulating again in the early 2000s and the two lineages have alternated in dominance since (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2). We investigated the sensitivity of the results to the frequency of B/Yamagata in the 1990s by alternatively estimating lineage frequencies from all countries represented in sequence databases for that period. We examined four effects of past infection (Table 1) as follows: (a) Within-lineage protection. Any previous infection with B/Victoria or B/Yamagata decreases susceptibility to future infections with the same lineage by fractions χVV and χYY, respectively, with a value of 1 representing full protection and a value of 0 representing no protection. (b) Cross-lineage protection. Cross-lineage protection was estimated as a fraction (γ) of the corresponding within-lineage protection against that lineage: χYV = γYV × χYY and χVY = γVY × χVV, where χYV is the protection from B/Victoria against B/Yamagata and χVY is the protection from B/Yamagata against B/Victoria. For instance, γYV = 0.7 means that compared with within-lineage B/Yamagata protection, protection from B/Victoria against B/Yamagata is 70% as strong. We assumed that once a person was infected with a lineage, within-lineage protection superseded protection from previous infection with the other lineage. (c) Lineage-specific imprinting. To represent increased protection against the lineage of first infection, susceptibility to B/Victoria and B/Yamagata could be further reduced by RV or RY if a person was first infected with the corresponding lineage. Thus, susceptibility to B/Victoria in people first infected with B/Victoria was (1 − χVV)(1 − RV) and susceptibility to B/Yamagata in people first infected with B/Yamagata was (1 − χYY)(1 − RY). A value of 1 for RV or RY results in perfect protection against the lineage first encountered, whereas a value of 0 means that within-lineage protection is the same regardless of the order of infection. (d) Infection with influenza B strains before 1988. As sequence data were too scarce before 1988 to reliably estimate the frequencies of B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, we treated all infections before 1988 as infections with a separate “ancestral” lineage A and estimated protection from those infections against B/Victoria (χVA) and B/Yamagata (χYA). Those infections encompass the ancestral influenza B lineage before the split between B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, and also strains circulating between the split and 1988. We modeled those infections to capture the age distributions of cases in people born before in the 1990s, but because of the uncertain identity and antigenic phenotype of strains circulating in that period, we interpreted the associated parameters with caution. We assumed that the protection conferred by an infection against future infections depends on the lineage but not on the time between infections. Since the lineages were identified in the late 1980s, the amino acid divergence of HA has been smaller within the lineages (≈7%) than between them (≈14%) (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Methods: “Sequence divergence analysis”). Assuming that cross-protection from past exposures does not decay over time allowed us to calculate infection history probabilities exactly without the need for dynamical simulations (Methods: “Infection history probabilities”). Influenza vaccination coverage was low in New Zealand during the study period in the non-elderly (0.5% for children <1 year old, 2–5% for each of four age groups spanning 1- to 49-year-olds, and 13% for the age group 50–64 years old in 201639; Methods: “Demographic data”) and we thus ignored protection by vaccination.Table 1 Possible infection histories in terms of the lineage of first infection and lineages encountered since.Full size table We fitted the model by maximum likelihood using the probabilities of observing an infection in each cohort as the parameters of a multinomial distribution. To limit model complexity, we fitted to cases from people born since 1959, i.e., to people 60 years old or younger at the time the cases were observed. Including older people (Supplementary Fig. 1) would have required additional parameters to describe age-related changes in susceptibility, vaccination, healthcare-seeking behavior, and contact rates, and potentially multiple ancestral strains. We assessed the effect of moving the birth year cutoff 7 years in each direction (1952 and 1966).Evidence for within-lineage protection and immune imprintingThe distributions of B/Victoria and B/Yamagata are most consistent with within-lineage protection against both lineages and imprinting protection against B/Yamagata, with weak or unidentifiable protection across lineages (Table 2, Fig. 3, and Supplementary Fig. 4). Any previous B/Victoria infection decreased the probability of medically attended infection with B/Victoria by 89% (χVV = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.85–0.96) and any previous B/Yamagata infection decreased the probability of medically attended B/Yamagata infection by 28% (χYY = 0.28, 95% CI 0.10–0.43). The data are most consistent with weak or nonexistent protection from B/Yamagata infections against B/Victoria (γVY = 0, 95% CI 0–0.07, corresponding to a reduction in susceptibility of 0–4% after re-scaling by χVV), whereas protection from B/Victoria against B/Yamagata was non-identifiable (γYV = 0, 95% CI 0–1). People for whom B/Yamagata was the lineage of first infection had an additional 87–100% reduction in susceptibility to clinical B/Yamagata infections compared with people infected with B/Yamagata after a primary infection with B/Victoria or with strains circulating before 1988 (RY = 0.96, 95% CI 0.87–1). The strength of imprinting for B/Victoria was non-identifiable (RV = 0.97, 95% CI 0–1).Table 2 Parameter estimates for the model fitted to the New Zealand case data.Full size tableFig. 3: Observed and predicted distributions of influenza B cases in New Zealand by birth year.The model was simultaneously fitted to the age distributions in each observation year from 2001 to 2019, accounting for uncertainty in the birth year of each reported case given the patient’s age. For plotting, we pooled observed and predicted numbers of cases across observation years for each birth year, assuming the earliest possible birth year for each age (e.g., an age of 10 years in 2000 was assumed to correspond to the birth year 1989). Red lines and dots show the fraction of cases in each birth cohort as predicted by the model. Vertical bars are 95% bootstrap confidence intervals based on n = 1000 multinomial draws from the predicted distributions indicated by the dots. In the bottom row, predicted and observed fractions of cases were normalized by dividing by the fraction of the population born in that birth year (i.e., the null expectation if all birth years were infected at the same rate).Full size imageThe model suggests imprinting protection against B/Yamagata contributes to two major features of the birth year distribution of cases: the low incidence of B/Yamagata compared to B/Victoria in people born in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the lower incidence of B/Yamagata in those birth cohorts compared with older cohorts (Fig. 3). As B/Yamagata appears to have been the only lineage circulating in New Zealand in the 1990s, many more people born in the late 1980s and early 1990s had been infected with B/Yamagata than with B/Victoria by the time the cases were recorded in the 2000s and 2010s (Fig. 4). Under the maximum likelihood estimates of infection history probabilities, 87% of people born between 1987 and 1993 had been infected with B/Yamagata by 2010 (the midpoint of the surveillance period), of which 96% had B/Yamagata as their first influenza B infection (Fig. 4). In contrast, only 55% of people in those birth cohorts had been infected with B/Victoria by 2010. Thus, cohorts born in the late 1980s and early 1990s were more susceptible to B/Victoria (about 50% as susceptible as a fully naive cohort) than to B/Yamagata (20% as susceptible).Fig. 4: Probabilities of different infection histories with influenza B in New Zealand for people born between 1959 and 2010, and observed in 2010.Infection histories consist of the lineage of first infection and lineages encountered later regardless of their order. Probabilities were estimated by fitting the model to case data from New Zealand. (A,0,0): first infection before 1988 and no subsequent infections with either B/Victoria or B/Yamagata. (A,Y,0) and (A,V,0): first infection before 1988 followed by B/Yamagata but not B/Victoria and by B/Victoria but not B/Yamagata, respectively. (A,{V,Y}): first infection before 1988 followed by infections with both B/Victoria and B/Yamagata in any order. (Y,V) and (Y,0): first infection with B/Yamagata, with and without a subsequent B/Victoria infection. (V,Y) and (V,0): first infection with B/Victoria, with and without a subsequent B/Yamagata infection. (0): fully naive to influenza B.Full size imageOlder birth cohorts, in contrast, were also likely infected with B/Yamagata in the 1990s and 2000s (74% of people born until 1986 had been infected with B/Yamagata by 2010), but unlike younger cohorts, they lacked the imprinting protection against B/Yamagata (Fig. 4). The high proportion of B/Yamagata cases in those older birth cohorts in the 2000s and 2010s, even after many people in them had already been infected with B/Yamagata, is consistent with only moderate within-lineage protection against B/Yamagata in the absence of immune imprinting. The difference in the proportion of B/Yamagata cases between cohorts born around 1990 and older birth cohorts also appears not due to differences in transmission related with age itself, as we estimated similar baseline annual infection rates for school-age children and adults (Table 2).Weak or nonexistent protection from B/Yamagata against B/Victoria is consistent with a surge of B/Victoria cases in children born in the late 1980s and early 1990s as B/Victoria re-emerged in New Zealand in the early 2000s (Supplementary Fig. 5). By 2000, 66% of people born in 1987–1993 had been infected with B/Yamagata. The high incidence of B/Victoria in those birth cohorts in the early 2000s suggests their history of B/Yamagata exposure did not protect them against medically attended B/Victoria infections. This lack of protection from B/Yamagata against B/Victoria was distinguishable from potential changes in transmission with age (Supplementary Fig. 6). The non-identifiability of cross-lineage protection in the other direction, from B/Victoria against B/Yamagata, might be due to the model estimating that relatively few people were infected with B/Victoria alone (Fig. 4). Our model assumes that protection from B/Yamagata infections themselves supersedes the protection from B/Victoria infections against B/Yamagata in people infected with both lineages.The estimated protection from strains circulating before 1988 against clinical infections suggests those early strains may have been antigenically more similar to B/Victoria than to B/Yamagata. Protection against B/Yamagata from strains circulating before 1988 (relative to protection from B/Yamagata itself) was non-identifiable (γYA = 1.00, 95% CI 0.00–1.00, corresponding to a 0–28% protection). It is possible that protection from those early strains against B/Yamagata violates our assumption that it cannot be stronger than protection from B/Yamagata itself, but the high proportion of B/Yamagata cases throughout the 2000s and 2010s in birth cohorts that were likely infected with those early strains suggests that such protection is limited at best (Supplementary Fig. 5). In contrast, the model estimated that infections with early strains were as protective against B/Victoria as were B/Victoria infections themselves (γVA = 1.00, 95% CI 0.93–1.00). Thus, when B/Victoria began circulating at high frequencies in the 2000s, birth cohorts with a history of influenza B infection prior to 1988 were strongly protected against medically attended B/Victoria infections.Sensitivity analyses corroborate the exclusive circulation of B/Yamagata in New Zealand in the 1990sAlthough previous work suggests B/Yamagata was the only lineage circulating widely outside of East Asia in the 1990s9, the evidence for the exclusive circulation of B/Yamagata in New Zealand during that period is limited. Few isolates collected in New Zealand or Australia during the 1990s were deposited in sequence databases (although they are all B/Yamagata, Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2) and antigenic surveillance often did not test circulating strains against representative B/Victoria strains. We re-fitted the model using lineage frequencies estimated from all countries represented in sequence databases for the 1990s—resulting in an average B/Victoria frequency of about 25% in that period (Supplementary Fig. 7)—and found that the age distributions of cases could not be adequately fitted using those alternative frequencies (a decrease of 53 log-likelihood units compared to the model fitted with only B/Yamagata in the 1990s for the same number of parameters). In particular, even with strong imprinting and cross-lineage protection from B/Victoria, the model could not fully capture the low number of B/Yamagata cases in cohorts born around 1990 (Supplementary Fig. 8). Thus, the age distributions of medically attended influenza B cases in New Zealand are most consistent with the exclusive circulation of B/Yamagata in the 1990s.Because we grouped infections before the lineages split with infections that occurred between the split and 1988, it is possible that the strong protection from those early strains against B/Victoria derives from a high incidence of B/Victoria during that period (which we are unable to detect). This potential period of B/Victoria dominance might also lead to imprinting protection against B/Victoria in cohorts born then. To investigate this possibility, we fitted the model assuming B/Victoria was the only lineage circulating from 1983 to 1990 and found a poorer fit to the data (by about 6 log-likelihood units) but overall similar estimates of protection (Supplementary Fig. 9). Even if assuming this period was dominated by B/Victoria, the data did not conclusively support imprinting protection against it (RV = 0, 95% CI 0–0.43). Cohorts born before the lineages split in the early 1980s do not appear more susceptible to B/Victoria than those born between the lineage split and 1990, when B/Victoria might have dominated (Fig. 3). We also simulated data identical in structure to the New Zealand case data, to verify that if B/Victoria had strong imprinting protection but limited within-lineage protection, as estimated from the observed data for B/Yamagata, the model would have correctly identified that scenario (Supplementary Fig. 10).The model captures broad features of the age distributions of cases in other regionsIf the estimated strengths of within- and cross-lineage protection are correct, our model should be able to explain the age distributions of cases outside New Zealand. As additional data sets with clear sampling criteria were not available, we used the model to predict the age distributions of influenza B sequences from the European Union (EU) and China on the GISAID database, and the age distribution of isolates from Australian hospital samples compiled by Vijaykrishna et al.28 (Methods: “Age distributions of cases in non-surveillance data”). In the absence of clear sampling criteria, the age distributions in those data sets might be affected by under or oversampling of particular age groups or by changes in sampling over time, factors that were not included in our model.Despite those potential biases and despite uncertainty in historical lineage frequencies in Europe and East Asia, the model reproduced major features of the age distributions in the additional data sets using estimates of protection from New Zealand (Supplementary Fig. 11). The model correctly predicted fewer B/Yamagata cases than B/Victoria cases in cohorts born around 1990 in the EU and Australia, where, as in New Zealand, only B/Yamagata circulated in the mid to late 1990s (all 51 isolates from 1995 to 1999 were B/Yamagata; Supplementary Fig. 2). In contrast, B/Victoria appears to have never stopped circulating during the 1990s in East Asia9 (Supplementary Fig. 2), although B/Yamagata might have been more common (65% of 275 isolates from East Asia in the 1990s). Compared to the other regions, the continued circulation of B/Victoria in East Asia would have decreased the difference in immunity against B/Yamagata vs. B/Victoria in cohorts born in the 1990s. Accordingly, the proportions of B/Victoria and B/Yamagata cases in those cohorts were more similar in China than in the other regions. This smaller difference was partly predicted by the model (Supplementary Fig. 11). However, the model still predicted a high proportion of B/Yamagata cases in older cohorts, which was not apparent in the Chinese data. When we re-estimated parameters separately for each data set, imprinting protection against B/Yamagata was inferred to be strong in the European and Australian data but was not identifiable in the Chinese data (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 12). Support for imprinting protection against B/Yamagata in the European data was robust to uncertainty in lineage frequencies in the early 1990s, when scarce isolate data suggest B/Victoria, and not B/Yamagata, may have dominated in Europe (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1).Estimates of cross-lineage protection in these additional data sets differed from the New Zealand estimates. This discrepancy might reflect differences in severity or health-seeking behavior between the data sets, for instance if cross-lineage protection occurs for severe cases but not milder cases. In contrast to the other data sets, the model estimated perfect within-lineage protection against B/Yamagata in China to account for the small proportions of B/Yamagata cases in older cohorts. This result too might arise from differences in severity between data sets, for instance, if older cohorts are susceptible to mild B/Yamagata cases but protected against severe ones. However, our model cannot disentangle those effects from sampling biases.Estimated infection probabilities are consistent with independent serological dataTo test whether our model produced realistic estimates of infection probabilities given complete susceptibility (βi parameters), we compared estimates from the model fitted to the New Zealand case data with estimates based on cross-sectional serology from children in the Netherlands40 (Methods: “Model validation with independent serological data”). Both the infection probabilities estimated from our model and those inferred from cross-sectional serology represent an average probability across influenza seasons. Despite potential differences between New Zealand and the Netherlands in the intensity of influenza B circulation and in lineage frequencies, we found similar estimates of infection risk. The annual probability of influenza B exposure was similar between our model (9% for preschoolers and 16% for school-age children, 95% CIs 7–10% and 13–20%, respectively) and the estimates from Dutch seroprevalence data (12% for preschoolers and 22% for school-age children, 95% CIs 10–14% and 16–27%, respectively). These estimates are also within the range of infection probabilities estimated from longitudinal studies18,41,42,43,44,45. The fraction of children with detectable antibodies against B/Victoria was close to the prediction from our model, but more children in the Netherlands had detectable B/Yamagata antibodies than predicted by the model for New Zealand (Supplementary Fig. 13). In addition to differences in lineage frequencies between New Zealand and the Netherlands, this discrepancy might be due to the presence of antibodies from B/Victoria infections that cross-react with B/Yamagata but not vice versa8,46,47,48,49.We performed two sensitivity analyses to test whether our conclusions held if the model were not given the freedom to estimate baseline infection probabilities (βi) and differential reporting for children under 2 years old (ρ). First, we fitted the model while removing the age-specific reporting parameter and constraining the baseline exposure probabilities to the values inferred from the Dutch seroprevalence data (using 22% for both school-age children and adults, as adults were not represented in those data). Second, we fitted the model while constraining baseline infection probabilities to be 30%, as reported by the Houston Family Study41,42, representing the upper range of independent estimates. Despite poorer fits to the data, parameter estimates were similar to those of the main analysis in both cases, except for protection from B/Victoria against B/Yamagata (γYV 95% CI 0.02–0.66 and 0–0.38, compared with 0–1 in the main analysis; Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15). Under a 30% exposure probability, the data would also support at most a very small imprinting protection against B/Victoria (RV 95% CI 0–0.07, compared to 0–1 in the main analysis). Thus, our main conclusions were independent of the model’s ability to estimate baseline exposure probabilities and differential reporting in children.Additional sensitivity analysesAdditional sensitivity analyses showed that estimates of protection based on the New Zealand data were similar if we excluded non-surveillance cases (Supplementary Figs. 16 and 17), if we moved the minimum birth year to which we fitted the model (1959) by 7 years in each direction (Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19), and if we assumed a separate reporting parameter for children under 5 years old instead of children under 2 years old (Supplementary Fig. 20). Fitted to both surveillance and non-surveillance cases combined, the model underestimated cases in the most recent birth cohorts due to variation over time in the number of non-surveillance cases reported in the youngest children (Supplementary Fig. 5). This variation might have been caused by changing sampling practices, for instance, if hospital samples from children were more likely to be collected in some years. Fitted to surveillance cases alone, however, the model predicted the number of cases in these birth cohorts well (Supplementary Fig. 17). Estimates of the remaining parameters were similar if we fixed at zero the two parameters that had large point estimates but were completely non-identifiable (imprinting protection against B/Victoria and protection from strains circulating before 1988 against B/Yamagata; Supplementary Fig. 21).Finally, as in children the first influenza infection also tends to be a recent infection, estimates of immune imprinting based on case data that include children might reflect a strong protection against recent infection instead of the effect of early infections per se12. To investigate this possibility, we re-fitted the model after excluding cases in children under 10 years old and found similar results (Supplementary Fig. 22). Thus, our estimate of B/Yamagata imprinting likely reflects the effect of early exposures.DiscussionOur model suggests that differences in the age distributions of B/Victoria and B/Yamagata cases can be explained by historical changes in lineage frequencies combined with cross-protection between strains of the same lineage and additional protection against B/Yamagata in people first infected with it. In particular, two major features of the age distributions seem to arise from the dominance of B/Yamagata in New Zealand in the 1990s. First, the model suggests that people born in the late 1980s and early 1990s had fewer B/Yamagata cases than B/Victoria cases in the 2000s and 2010s because they had accumulated immunity against B/Yamagata but not B/Victoria during the 1990s. Second, imprinting of people born in the late 1980s and early 1990s with B/Yamagata led to fewer B/Yamagata cases in those birth cohorts than in older and younger ones, whose primary influenza B infections were less likely to be B/Yamagata. Whereas previous work revealed immune imprinting at the level of the HA groups and subtypes of influenza A10,11,12, our results suggest a similar phenomenon occurs between more recently diverged and thus antigenically closer branches of influenza B. The major antigens HA and NA evolve more slowly within the influenza B lineages than within influenza A subtypes22,28,37 and the amino acid sequence divergences are much lower between B/Victoria and B/Yamagata (≈14%, 2%, and 7% in 2019 for the HA head, the HA stalk, and NA, respectively) than between H1N1 and H3N2 (≈66%, 50%, and 60%, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 23). Still, epitopes conserved within the lineages but variable between them (or between the lineages and their ancestor) might be the basis for imprinting protection against B/Yamagata (and potentially B/Victoria), as has been hypothesized for influenza A subtypes11,12,34,35. Whereas imprinting protection against B/Yamagata has a clear effect on the age distributions of cases, the non-identifiability of imprinting protection against B/Victoria might be due to the lack of an extended period when B/Victoria circulated at consistently higher frequencies than B/Yamagata. Our analysis is limited by the scarcity of data on the identity and antigenic phenotype of influenza B strains circulating prior to the lineage split and on lineage frequencies shortly after. However, even if we assumed B/Victoria circulated alone between the lineage split and 1990, the data did not conclusively support imprinting protection against B/Victoria. We speculate that antibodies elicited by primary B/Yamagata infections might target epitopes that are more conserved (or affect viral neutralization more strongly) than epitopes targeted by antibodies from primary B/Victoria infections.The model suggests protection from B/Yamagata against medically attended B/Victoria infections is weak at most, but it could not estimate the strength of cross-lineage protection in the other direction. Previous serological and vaccine effectiveness studies disagree on the strength of cross-lineage protection. B/Yamagata often induces low or undetectable levels of HA antibodies cross-reactive to B/Victoria8,46,47,48,49, consistent with our estimate of weak protection. The same studies of strains from the late 1980s, 2000s, and 2010s show that exposure to B/Victoria induces antibodies that inhibit hemagglutination by B/Yamagata, suggesting B/Victoria might protect against B/Yamagata even if this protection does not strongly affect the age distributions of cases. In contrast to the asymmetric cross-lineage protection suggested by these serological observations, cross-lineage protection in both directions has been observed in some vaccine efficacy studies but not in others, with unexplained variation across seasons and age groups50,51,52,53,54,55,56. Longitudinal studies of infection and vaccination might reveal if cross-lineage protection differs between infection and vaccination or varies with age (e.g., via increased bias toward conserved epitopes in adults57,58) or vaccine type (inactivated or live attenuated). Studies of children first exposed to influenza B via vaccination might also reveal if imprinting can occur via trivalent vaccines containing only one influenza B lineage or quadrivalent vaccines containing both.Our results also suggest that the acquisition of a B/Yamagata NA gene by B/Victoria strains via reassortment in 2000–200126,59 did not lead to substantial protection against the reassortant strains in people previously infected with B/Yamagata. Although most studies of the antibody response to influenza focus on HA, serological evidence suggests immune responses targeting NA but not HA are common for influenza B, especially in children45. Yet, birth cohorts with a history of B/Yamagata infections had a high proportion of clinical B/Victoria infections in the 2000s, even though all B/Victoria cases in the data occurred after B/Victoria had acquired a B/Yamagata NA. These results suggest that protection against B/Victoria is not strongly mediated by anti-NA antibodies.The difference in the estimated strength of within-lineage protection without imprinting for B/Victoria (85–96%) and B/Yamagata (10–43%) might be due to differences in the times of infection for the birth cohorts informing each of the estimates and different rates of antigenic evolution between the lineages. As most people born since the late 1980s and infected with B/Yamagata were imprinted with it, our estimate of within-lineage protection against B/Yamagata in the absence of immune imprinting is mostly informed by cases in older birth cohorts lacking imprinting protection against B/Yamagata. Most of the B/Yamagata infections in those birth cohorts would have occurred in the 1990s, when B/Yamagata was dominant. In contrast, our estimate of within-lineage non-imprinting protection against B/Victoria was informed by more recent B/Victoria infections in younger birth cohorts, including people who were imprinted with B/Yamagata in the 1990s and later infected with B/Victoria in the 2000s. As these B/Victoria infections were more recent, they were potentially antigenically closer to modern strains than were the B/Yamagata infections that inform estimated within-lineage protection against B/Yamagata, and thus less likely to violate our assumption of constant within-lineage protection over time. However, B/Victoria appears to undergo slightly faster antigenic evolution than B/Yamagata22,28, with several clades containing amino acid deletions emerging since 201533. These deletions have not been accompanied by an increase in B/Victoria cases in cohorts in which past B/Victoria infections are common (Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting they did not strongly affect within-lineage protection against B/Victoria. Longitudinal studies of infection risk might reveal if within-lineage protection against B/Yamagata without imprinting is stronger in recent birth cohorts.It remains unclear precisely how differences in people’s antibody responses and past infections shape their susceptibility to influenza. Our model and others10,11,12 show how analyses based on birth cohorts can reveal broad dynamics and potential mechanisms of immune protection. Characterizing antibody specificity after infection and vaccination might reveal the mechanisms behind these patterns. Antibody targeting of NA and of particular HA epitopes is known to change with age57,58,60, but few studies have linked antibody specificity to the infection history of particular birth cohorts and their susceptibility to particular variants23,25,61. This resolution could improve our understanding of influenza epidemiology and the response to influenza vaccination.MethodsCase dataMedically attended influenza B cases in New Zealand were identified from samples taken from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) attended by a network of general practitioners recruited for surveillance (2430 cases with an identified influenza B lineage) and from non-surveillance hospital samples (1606 cases with an identified lineage) analyzed by regional diagnostic laboratories and by the World Health Organization (WHO) National Influenza Centre at the Institute for Environmental Science and Research (ESR). Briefly, general practice surveillance operates from May to September, with participating practices collecting nasopharyngeal or throat swabs from the first ILI patient examined on each Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. ILI is defined as an “acute respiratory tract infection characterized by an abrupt onset of at least two of the following: fever, chills, headache, and myalgia”38. A subset of the New Zealand data (cases from 2002 to 2013) was previously compiled by Vijaykrishna et al.28 along with cases from Australia reported to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne.Statistical model of influenza B susceptibility based on infection historyFor lineage V (B/Victoria), we modeled the number of cases in people born in birth year b observed in season y as a multinomial draw with probabilities given by:$${\theta }_{V}(b,y)=D(b,y)\beta (b,y){Z}_{V}(b,y)\rho (b,y)$$ (1) with an analogous equation defining the multinomial distribution θY(b, y) for lineage Y (B/Yamagata). D(b, y) is the fraction of the population that was born in year b as of observation season y. Z(b, y) is the susceptibility to lineage V during season y of a person born in year b relative to that of an unexposed person. β(b, y) is a baseline probability of infection with influenza B that captures differences in transmission associated with age (thus depending on b and y) and is equal to β1 if people born in year b are in preschool during season y (0–5 years old), β2 if they are school-age children or teenagers (6–17 years old), or β3 if they are 18 or older. ρ(b,y) is an age-specific factor equal to a parameter ρ if people are <2 years old and 1 otherwise. Whereas β(b, y) represents true differences in infection probabilities between preschoolers and post-preschool individuals, and thus affects the infection history probabilities in the calculation of Z(b, y), ρ(b, y) represents a differential probability of receiving medical attention and does not affect those probabilities. For each lineage and observation season, values of θ from Eq. (1) are normalized by their sum across birth years to make them proper multinomial probabilities.We defined relative susceptibility to V, ZV(b, y), as an expectation over all possible immune histories in terms of the lineage of first infection and subsequent infection with the other lineage. We let susceptibility be 1 for a person never exposed to influenza B. Cross-immunity from any previously encountered strain of V or Y decreased susceptibility to the corresponding lineage by χVV and χYY, respectively. Susceptibility was further reduced by RV or RY if the lineage of first infection was V or Y. In the absence of a previous homologous infection, previous infection with Y decreased susceptibility to V by χVY and previous infection to V decreased susceptibility to Y by χYV. Protection due to homologous infections superseded cross-lineage protection. Protection against V from a previous Y infection was constrained to be a fraction of the within-lineage protection to V (and vice versa): χVY = χVV ⋅ γVY, χYV = χYY ⋅ γYV, where 0 ≤ γVY, γYV ≤ 1. Similarly, pre-1988 infections reduced susceptibility to V by χVA = χVV ⋅ γVA and to Y by χYA = χYY ⋅ γYA. Finally, ZV(b, y) was calculated as the sum of susceptibilities in Table 1 weighted by the probabilities of the corresponding infection histories (below). Relative susceptibility to Y, ZY(b, y) was defined analogously.We estimated parameters by maximum likelihood using R (version 3.4.3) and package optimParallel. We calculated the total likelihood as the product of the likelihood for each lineage in each observation year, with the number of cases in each combination treated as an independent multinomial draw. For plotting, we summed the observed and predicted cases for each birth year across observation years.Infection history probabilitiesTo calculate the probabilities in Table 1, we assumed infections occur in discrete time measured in units of annual influenza seasons. We considered possible infections in each season between birth and the last season before observation season y. For a person born in year b and previously unexposed to influenza B, we let ab,i be the probability of becoming infected in season i. This probability was then modified by protection from previous infections as in Table 1. Given that an infection occurred in season i, we assumed that the probability it was caused by lineages A (“ancestor”), V or Y was equal to their frequencies in that season, fA,i, fV,i, and fY,i, with fA,i = 1 for all i before 1988, and fV,i + fY,i = 1 since (Fig. 1). For simplicity, we assumed that people could not be infected more than once in each season (including simultaneous infections by the two lineages.)Let \({{{\Phi }}}_{i,j}^{B}\) be the probability that no infections with influenza B occurred for a naive person born in b from seasons i to j (inclusive). It is given by$${{{\Phi }}}_{i,j}^{B}=\mathop{\prod }\limits_{k=i}^{j}(1-{a}_{b,k})$$ (2) where k indexes years (influenza seasons). Thus, the first probability in Table 1, that of being fully naive to influenza B, is given by:$${P}_{0}(b,y)={{{\Phi }}}_{b,y-1}^{B}$$ (3) To shorten the expressions for the remaining probabilities, we let \({{{\Phi }}}_{i,j}^{V}(h)\), \({{{\Phi }}}_{i,j}^{Y}(h)\) and \({{{\Phi }}}_{i,j}^{VY}(h)\) be the probability that no V infections, no Y infections, and neither V nor Y infections occurred between seasons i and j (inclusive), respectively. Unlike ΦB, which applies to naive people, ΦV, ΦY, and ΦVY depend on the person’s infection history, h. To calculate the probability of an initial infection with A but no subsequent infections with V or Y, PA,0,0(b, y), we integrated, across all possible seasons i of first infection, the joint probability that the person’s first influenza B infection occurred in season i with the ancestral lineage A, and that no subsequent infections with V or Y occurred from i + 1 to y − 1:$${P}_{A,0,0}(b,y)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=b}^{y-1}\left[{{{\Phi }}}_{b,i-1}^{B}\cdot {a}_{b,i}\cdot {f}_{A,i}\cdot {{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,y-1}^{VY}(A)\right]$$ (4) where the probability that the first infection with influenza B occurred in season i with the ancestor A is obtained by multiplying the probability of no previous infections (\({{{\Phi }}}_{b,i-1}^{B}\)) by the probability of an infection in season i (ab,i) and by the frequency of lineage A in season i (fA,i). The probability of no infections with either V or Y after the initial infection with A in season i, \({{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,y-1}^{VY}(A)\), depends on protection from the A infection against V (χVA) and Y (χYA):$${{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,y-1}^{VY}(A)=\mathop{\prod }\limits_{k=i+1}^{y-1}\{1-{a}_{b,k}[{f}_{V,k}(1-{\chi }_{VA})+{f}_{Y,k}(1-{\chi }_{YA})]\}$$ (5) Similarly, the joint probability of first infection with the ancestor A and subsequent infection with V, but not with Y, is given by$${P}_{A,V,0}(b,y)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=b}^{y-1}\left[\right.{{{\Phi }}}_{b,i-1}^{B}{a}_{b,i}{f}_{A,i}\cdot \mathop{\sum }\limits_{j=i+1}^{y-1}{{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,j-1}^{VY}(A){a}_{b,j}{f}_{V,j}(1-{\chi }_{VA}){{{\Phi }}}_{j+1,y-1}^{Y}(A,V)\left]\right.$$ (6) where we again integrated over all possible seasons i when the first infection with influenza B might have occurred. Given the first infection occurred in season i with the “ancestral” lineage A, we calculated the probability of subsequent infection with V, but not with Y, by integrating over all possible seasons j when the first infection with V may have occurred. Given the initial infection with A in season i, the joint probability that the first V infection occurred in j is given by the probability that neither V nor Y infections occurred from i + 1 to j − 1, \({{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,j-1}^{VY}(A)\), times the probability of a V infection in season j, given by ab,jfV,j(1 − χVA). The probability \({{{\Phi }}}_{j+1,y-1}^{Y}(A,V)\) of no subsequent Y infections after season j given the previous A and V infections is then given by$${{{\Phi }}}_{j+1,y-1}^{Y}(A,V)=\mathop{\prod }\limits_{k=j+1}^{y-1}\{1-{a}_{b,k}{f}_{Y,k}[1-\max ({\chi }_{YA},{\chi }_{YV})]\}$$ (7) where we assumed that only the strongest cross-protection (from the previous A and V infections) applies. By analogy, for PA,Y,0(b, y) we have$${P}_{A,Y,0}(b,y)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=b}^{y-1}\left[\right.{{{\Phi }}}_{b,i-1}^{B}{a}_{b,i}{f}_{A,i}\cdot \mathop{\sum }\limits_{j=i+1}^{y-1}{{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,j-1}^{VY}(A){a}_{b,j}{f}_{Y,j}(1-{\chi }_{YA}){{{\Phi }}}_{j+1,y-1}^{V}(A,Y)\left]\right.$$ (8) where$${{{\Phi }}}_{j+1,y-1}^{V}(A,Y)=\mathop{\prod }\limits_{k=j+1}^{y-1}\{1-{a}_{b,k}{f}_{V,k}[1-\max ({\chi }_{VA},{\chi }_{VY})]\}$$ (9) To calculate PA,{VY}(b, y), we first computed the probabilities for the particular cases where either V or Y were the second infection, PA,V→Y(b, y) and PA,Y→V(b, y), such that PA,{VY}(b, y) is the sum of the two. The first is given by$${P}_{A,V\to Y}(b,y)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=b}^{y-1}\left[\right.{{{\Phi }}}_{b,i-1}^{B}{a}_{b,i}{f}_{A,i}\cdot \mathop{\sum }\limits_{j=i+1}^{y-1}{{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,j-1}^{VY}(A){a}_{b,j}{f}_{V,j}(1-{\chi }_{VA})[1-{{{\Phi }}}_{j+1,y-1}^{Y}(A,V)]\left]\right.$$ (10) and the second is given by$${P}_{A,Y\to V}(b,y)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=b}^{y-1}\left[\right.{{{\Phi }}}_{b,i-1}^{B}{a}_{b,i}{f}_{A,i}\cdot \mathop{\sum }\limits_{j=i+1}^{y-1}{{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,j-1}^{VY}(A){a}_{b,j}{f}_{Y,j}(1-{\chi }_{YA})[1-{{{\Phi }}}_{j+1,y-1}^{V}(A,Y)]\left]\right.$$ (11) Next, we write down the probabilities of infection histories with either V or Y as first infections and no subsequent infections. For PV,0(b, y),$${P}_{V,0}(b,y)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=b}^{y-1}{{{\Phi }}}_{b,i-1}^{B}\cdot {a}_{b,i}\cdot {f}_{V,i}\cdot {{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,y-1}^{Y}(V)$$ (12) where$${{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,y-1}^{Y}(V)=\mathop{\prod }\limits_{k=i+1}^{y-1}[1-{a}_{b,k}{f}_{Y,k}(1-{\chi }_{YV})]$$ (13) By analogy, for PY,0(b, y),$${P}_{Y,0}(b,y)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=b}^{y-1}{{{\Phi }}}_{b,i-1}^{B}\cdot {a}_{b,i}\cdot {f}_{Y,i}\cdot {{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,y-1}^{V}(Y)$$ (14) where$${{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,y-1}^{V}(Y)=\mathop{\prod }\limits_{k=i+1}^{y-1}[1-{a}_{b,k}{f}_{V,k}(1-{\chi }_{VY})]$$ (15) Finally, PV,Y(b, y) and PY,V(b, y) are given by$${P}_{V,Y}(b,y)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=b}^{y-1}{{{\Phi }}}_{b,i-1}^{B}\cdot {a}_{b,i}\cdot {f}_{V,i}\cdot [1-{{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,y-1}^{Y}(V)]$$ (16) $${P}_{Y,V}(b,y)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=b}^{y-1}{{{\Phi }}}_{b,i-1}^{B}\cdot {a}_{b,i}\cdot {f}_{Y,i}\cdot [1-{{{\Phi }}}_{i+1,y-1}^{V}(Y)]$$ (17) As case data had information on age and not the exact birth year, we averaged each exposure history probability across the two possible birth years given the age and the observation year (for instance, a 10-year-old in 2000 may have been born in either 1989 or 1990). As the probabilities of different infection histories become very similar for cohorts born long before the lineages split, we used the probabilities calculated for the birth year 1970 for all previous cohorts to decrease computation time.Season-specific attack ratesLet Pinf(b, i, t) be the probability that a previously unexposed person born in year b has been infected with influenza B after experiencing fraction t ∈ [0, 1] of season i. Assuming a constant instantaneous attack rate αb,i throughout the season, Pinf(b, i, t) is given by:$${{P}}_{\text{inf}}(b,i,t)=1-{e}^{-{\alpha }_{b,i}t}$$ (18) We let the instantaneous attack rate αb,i be equal to an age-specific baseline multiplied by an intensity score Si representing the strength of influenza B circulation in season i relative to other seasons:$${\alpha }_{b,i}=-{\mathrm{ln}}\,[1-\beta (b,y)]\cdot {S}_{i},$$ (19) where β(b, y) takes on value β1, if birth year b corresponds to an age of <5 in year y, β2, if the corresponding age is 6–17 years, and β3 for ages 18 and older. The probability of infection for an unexposed person born in year b across the entire season, ab, i, is obtained by substituting αb,i in Eq. (18) and setting t = 1:$${a}_{b,i}=1-{e}^{-{\alpha }_{b,i}}=1-{[1-\beta (b,y)]}^{{S}_{i}}$$ (20) The definition of αb,i in Eq. (19) was chosen such that for a season with average influenza intensity (Si = 1), the annual probability of infection for an unexposed person is equal to β(b,y).For the season corresponding to the first year of life (i = b), people are only susceptible to infections during a fraction of the season, depending on when they were born and how long they were protected by maternal antibodies. In those cases, we defined ab,i as the expected probability of infection across all possible weeks of birth:$${a}_{b,i}=\frac{1}{{W}_{b}}\mathop{\sum}\limits_{w}1-{e}^{-{\alpha }_{b,i}{\phi }_{i}(b,w+M)},\quad \,{\text{for}}\; i=b$$ (21) where ϕi(b, w) is the fraction of cases in season i observed in or after week w of year b and Wb is the number of weeks in year b. As people are assumed to be completely protected against infection by maternal antibodies for the first M weeks following birth, ϕi was computed for an effective birth week w + M. Based on the fraction of children under the age of 1 year with detectable antibodies to influenza B40, we set M to 26 weeks (~6 months). Averaging ϕi(b, w + M) over all possible birth weeks w in year b gives the expected fraction of season i experienced by a person born in year b assuming births are distributed uniformly in time. We estimated ϕi(b, w) by fitting the incomplete β-function to the cumulative fraction of cases in the seasons for which we had case data, using R package FlexParamCurve. Following Gostic et al.10, we truncated season-specific infection probabilities so that they never exceed 0.75 even in years of high estimated influenza B intensity.Intensity scoresWe defined the intensity score Si in Eq. (19) as:$${S}_{i}=\frac{ \% \ {\rm{Influenza}}\ {\rm{B}}\ {\rm{in}}\ {\rm{ILI}}\ {\rm{specimens}}\times {\rm{ILI}}\ {\rm{incidence}},\;{\rm{for}}\ {\rm{season}}\ i}{{\rm{Mean}}[ \% \ {\rm{Influenza}}\ {\rm{B}}\ {\rm{in}}\ {\rm{ILI}}\ {\rm{specimens}}\times {\rm{ILI}}\ {\rm{incidence}}]\;{\rm{across}}\ {\rm{seasons}}}$$ (22) Annual influenza surveillance reports from New Zealand’s Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) available from 2003 on give the “isolation” or “detection” rate (the number of influenza-positive swabs divided by the number of swabs tested), the percentage of influenza A and B viruses among all influenza-positive isolates (both “sentinel” and “non-sentinel”), and the estimated number of ILI cases in New Zealand for each season62. The reports do not directly give the fraction of ILI specimens that were influenza B positive. Instead, we calculated the fraction of ILI isolates that were influenza B positive in a season by multiplying the fraction of ILI isolates that were influenza positive by the fraction of influenza-positive specimens that were influenza B. For seasons without data on the fraction of influenza-positive specimens in ILI specimens (1988 to 2000), without data on the fraction of influenza B in influenza-positive specimens (1988–1989), or without estimates of the total number of ILI cases (1988–2001), we used the average values of those quantities across the remaining seasons. Although reports are not available for 1990–2002, the 2003 annual report lists the frequency of influenza B in influenza-positive specimens for those seasons.The WHO’s FluNet has weekly data on the fraction of ILI specimens that were influenza B positive in Australia from 1997 to the present. However, in data from before 2003, the number of influenza-positive specimens was usually the same as the reported number of specimens processed for that week, suggesting strong case ascertainment or reporting bias. We thus used data on the percent of influenza-positive ILI cases from 2003 on. Annual influenza reports from 1994 to 2010 are available from the Australian government’s Department of Health website63. They report numbers of influenza A- and B-positive isolates but not the total number of specimens tested. Thus, only the fraction of influenza B in influenza isolates (but not in ILI isolates) can be estimated from those reports. We therefore used data from the WHO to calculate the fraction of influenza B-positive specimens in ILI specimens for 2003–2017. For 1994–2002, we multiplied the fraction of influenza B in influenza-positive specimens for each season (from the Department of Health reports) by the average annual fraction of influenza-positive specimens in ILI specimens from 2003 to 2017 (from the WHO data), to arrive at the fraction of influenza B-positive ILI specimens. Finally, for seasons where data were missing altogether (1988–1993), we used the average annual fraction of influenza B-positive specimens in ILI specimens for subsequent seasons (1994–2017).To estimate ILI incidence in Australia, we used the maximum weekly number of ILI cases per 1000 consultations for each season from Department of Health annual and weekly reports (weekly reports are available for years since the last annual report in 2010). Different ILI definitions were used from 1994 to 2003 and from 2004 to 2010, and starting in 2009 reported weekly ILI rates were averaged from multiple branches of the Australian influenza surveillance system. We thus normalized values by the average value within each of those periods (1994–2003, 2004–2008, and 2009–2018) to arrive at a normalized peak number of ILI cases per 1000 consultations in Australia.Historical frequencies of influenza B lineagesTo estimate historical frequencies of B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, we downloaded data on lineage and date and country of isolation for all influenza B isolates on the GISAID website collected until 31 December 2019. To complement these data, we searched the NCBI Influenza Virus Database for all protein-coding HA sequences of influenza B viruses isolated from humans and excluding laboratory strains (information on passage history for GISAID entries was scarce and non-standardized, and so we did not filter out laboratory strains from the GISAID data). As lineage information was missing for virtually all sequences retrieved from NCBI, we used BLAST to assign each sequence to either B/Victoria or B/Yamagata, based on the highest bit score match with reference sequences B/Victoria/2/87 and B/Yamagata/16/1988.We combined data from both databases to estimate the frequency of B/Yamagata and B/Victoria isolates in each season. Isolates collected in year y in Europe or North America were assigned to season y − 1/y, if collected before October and to season y/y + 1 if collected in October–December. As most European and North American isolates were collected before October of the respective year (median across years = 83% for Gisaid and 82% for NCBI), we assumed isolates with missing month of collection in those regions were collected before October (and thus belonged to the season beginning in the previous calendar year).Isolates with the same name but reported for different countries or seasons were considered separately. We condensed multiple occurrences of the same isolate in the same country and season (within or across data sets) into one, disregarding isolates for which different lineages were assigned in different countries/seasons. Using isolates present in both databases, we found that our BLAST lineage assignment matched the lineage reported on GISAID in 98% (3159/3217) of cases. We disregarded isolates for which our BLAST assignment and the reported GISAID assignment disagreed. The final data set consisted of 35,158 isolates, 23 of which (0.07%) were represented more than once (in different countries or seasons). We estimated the frequency of a lineage as the number of isolates belonging to that lineage divided by the total number of influenza B isolates collected in a season.As all 23 isolates collected in New Zealand and Australia in the 1990s were B/Yamagata (Supplementary Fig. 2), and as previous work suggests B/Victoria circulated only in East Asia during that period9, we assumed the frequency of B/Yamagata in New Zealand and Australia to be 100% from 1988 to 2000, even though no isolates were available for several individual years within that range. In 2001 and 2003, when both lineages are known to have been circulating in New Zealand and Australia, but fewer than ten isolates were available for the two countries combined in the sequence databases, we used frequencies estimated from all other countries combined. Frequencies estimated from all other countries combined were strongly correlated with estimates based on isolates from Australia and New Zealand only (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.88, 95% CI 0.76–0.95). We also considered using frequencies estimated from isolates collected in the United States, which were also correlated with frequencies in Australia and New Zealand (Supplementary Fig. 2), but the correlation was weaker (0.69, 95% CI 0.42–0.85). For the sensitivity analysis of lineage frequencies in the 1990s, we re-fitted the model using frequencies from all countries combined for all years from 1988 on in which fewer than ten isolates were available for New Zealand and Australia combined, including years in the 1990s.We hoped to use the sequence databases to get more reliable estimates of lineage frequencies in the 1980s than those provided by early antigenic characterization8, but fewer than ten isolates were available for each year before 1988. To accommodate uncertainty, we grouped infections with B/Victoria and B/Yamagata before 1988 with infections by the ancestral influenza B strains circulating before the lineages split.We compared our estimates of lineage frequencies based on sequence data to estimates based on antigenic characterization of circulating strains from epidemiological surveillance reports (Supplementary Fig. 2). Surveillance reports from Australia are available from the Australian Government’s Department of Health website63. Surveillance reports from New Zealand are available from the website of New Zealand’s Institute of ESR62. Although reports from New Zealand are only available from 2003 on, Fig. 27 of the 2012 report shows B/Victoria and B/Yamagata frequencies from 1990 to 2002 (without reporting the number of isolates used to estimate those frequencies). Annual summaries of influenza surveillance in the United States are published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (e.g., see ref. 64).Age distributions of cases in non-surveillance dataWe applied the model to the age distributions of influenza B isolates available on GISAID. In these analyses, isolate data are used in two different ways: both to estimate historical lineage frequencies and to estimate the age distributions of cases to which the model is fitted. Although historical lineage frequencies are calculated based on all GISAID isolates with lineage information (and complemented with isolates from the NCBI Influenza Virus Database; see above), only a subset of GISAID isolates are annotated with both the isolate’s lineage and the host’s age, and therefore only a subset can be used to estimate the age distributions of cases. We analyzed the age distributions of isolates from the EU and China, because those regions have many isolates with both lineage and age information (4702 isolates from 2006 to 2018 for the EU, 1880 isolates from 2005 to 2019 for China) and easily available demographic data for the general population (we excluded the United States, because historically high influenza vaccination coverage would require incorporating vaccination into the model). To increase statistical power for the estimates of historical lineage frequencies, we included isolates from European countries outside the EU and countries in East Asia besides China (South Korea, Japan, Mongolia, and Taiwan) represented in GISAID (Supplementary Fig. 2). Individual countries are represented in different proportions in the lineage frequency and age distribution data sets (Supplementary Fig. 24). Thus, if lineage frequencies vary in space within Europe or within East Asia, our estimates of infection history probabilities might be biased relative to the true infection histories associated with the age distributions used to fit the model.As B/Yamagata was the only lineage circulating in Europe in the mid to late 1990s, when isolate data were more abundant, we assumed B/Yamagata was completely dominant throughout the entire 1990s, as we did for New Zealand. We relaxed this assumption by letting B/Victoria be the only circulating lineage in 1988–1993 in Europe, consistent with its high frequency in the scarce isolate data from that period.For both the EU and China, we assumed constant intensity scores across seasons (Si = 1) and used the cumulative incidence of cases within seasons (ϕi(b, w)) from New Zealand to model infection in the first year of life.Demographic dataWe obtained annual age distributions for the general population by single year of age from governmental websites from New Zealand65, Australia66, China67, and the EU68.Model validation with independent serological dataWe compared the fraction of children predicted by our model to have been previously infected with B/Victoria, B/Yamagata, or either lineage with the fraction of children that had detectable antibodies against the corresponding lineage (or any influenza B strain) in the Netherlands40. Sera from children 0 to 7 years old collected between February 2006 and June 2007 were tested using the hemagglutination inhibition assay against a panel of reference B/Victoria and B/Yamagata strains, as well as of strains isolated in the Netherlands during the study period. Sera were considered positive if their hemagglutination inhibition titer was ≥10 against at least one strain from the corresponding set (all influenza B strains, B/Victoria strains, and B/Yamagata strains). We compared these data with predictions under the maximum likelihood parameter estimates of our model fitted to the complete New Zealand data.We also used the seroprevalence data to independently estimate the annual probability of infection for preschoolers and school-age children, equivalent to the β1 and β2 parameters in our model. Assuming a constant instantaneous attack rate α, an individual of age A years is still naive (and therefore seronegative) to influenza B with probability PN(A) given by:$${P}_{\mathrm{N}}(A)={e}^{-\alpha A}$$ (23) The probability of observing X seronegative individuals in a sample of n individuals of age A can be calculated assuming X ~ Binomial[n,PN(A)], and α thus can be estimated by maximum likelihood. The annual attack rate can then be calculated from the instantaneous attack rate α as βNetherlands = 1 − e−α.We make two modifications to Eq. (23) to account for the presence of maternal antibodies early in life and for uncertainty in the age of individuals when their serum was collected. First, we assume individuals spend a time m (in units of years) fully protected against influenza B due to the presence of maternal antibodies. Consistent with the fraction of children under the age of 1 year with detectable antibodies to influenza B40, we assumed m = 0.5 year. Second, as ages were reported at the resolution of 1 year (e.g., an individual 2.6 years old is reported as being 2 years old), we assume individuals with recorded age A were sampled at a randomly distributed time T ∈ [0, 1) during the interval between the ages of A and A + 1. Thus, we let PN(A) be given by the expectation over T:$${P}_{\mathrm{N}}(A)=E[{e}^{-\alpha (A+T-m)}]=\int_{0}^{1}{e}^{-\alpha (A+t-m)}f(t)dt$$ (24) where f(t) is the probability density function of T. Assuming T is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 (i.e., f(t) = 1), we have:$${P}_{\mathrm{N}}(A) = \int _{0}^{1}{e}^{-\alpha (A+t-m)}dt\\ = \, {e}^{-\alpha (A-m)}\int_{0}^{1}{e}^{-\alpha t}dt\\ = \, {e}^{-\alpha (A-m)}\frac{(1-{e}^{-\alpha })}{\alpha }$$ (25) valid for A > m and α > 0. Letting α1 and α2 be the instantaneous attack rates for preschoolers and school-age children:$${P}_{\mathrm{N}}(A)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}{e}^{-{\alpha }_{1}(A-m)}\frac{(1-{e}^{-{\alpha }_{1}})}{{\alpha }_{1}},\hfill&\,{\text{if}}\,A\; \le\; {A}_{\mathrm{s}}\\ {e}^{-{\alpha }_{1}({A}_{\mathrm{s}}-m)}{e}^{-{\alpha }_{2}(A-{A}_{\mathrm{s}})}\frac{(1-{e}^{-{\alpha }_{2}})}{{\alpha }_{2}},&\,{\text{if}}\,A\; > \; {A}_{\mathrm{s}}\end{array}\right.$$ (26) where As is the age at which children start going to school (4 years old in the Netherlands69). It is noteworthy that for school-age children (the equation for A > As on the bottom), the correction term for uncertainty in sampling is not necessary for the time spent in preschool (assumed to be exactly As years), only for the time after preschool (A − As).Handling cases with missing lineage informationWe assumed cases with missing lineage information in 2002 (n = 61), 2011 (n = 312), and 2019 (n = 206) belonged to B/Victoria, as 99% or more of identified cases in those seasons were B/Victoria (86/87 cases in 2002, 276/280 cases in 2011, and 552/552 cases in 2019) as were 94%, 92%, and 92%, respectively, of isolates from sequence databases (for Australia and New Zealand combined). We assumed cases with missing lineage information belonged to B/Yamagata in 2013 (n = 37), 2014 (n = 77), and 2017 (n = 87), when the majority of identified cases were B/Yamagata (268/272, 131/138, and 473/489, respectively), as were 99%, 94%, and 84%, respectively, of isolates in sequence databases. Unidentified cases in other seasons were disregarded, because both lineages were present at higher frequencies among identified cases. Removing unidentified cases altogether in all seasons led to similar parameter estimates.Sequence divergence analysisTo estimate the amount of evolution within and between lineages, we analyzed all complete HA and NA sequences from human influenza B isolates available on GISAID in July 2019. The set of isolates used in this analysis differs from the set used to estimate lineage frequencies, because we required isolates to have complete sequences (although not all sequences listed as complete on GISAID were in fact complete). Two isolates collected in 2000 (B/Hong Kong/548/2000 and B/Victoria/504/2000) were deposited as B/Victoria but our BLAST assignment indicated they were in fact B/Yamagata (their low divergence from B/Yamagata strains was a clear outlier). NA sequences from isolates B/Kanagawa/73 and B/Ann Arbor/1994 were only small fragments (99 and 100 amino acids long) poorly aligned with other sequences and were thus excluded. We also excluded NA sequences from B/Yamagata isolates B/Catalonia/NSVH100773835/2018 and B/Catalonia/NSVH100750997/2018, because they were extremely diverged (60% and 38%) from the reference strain B/Yamagata/16/88 and aligned poorly with other sequences.To compare sequence diversity within and between lineages over time, we aligned sequences using MAFFT v. 7.31070 and calculated percent amino acid differences in pairs of sequences from the same lineage and in pairs with one sequence from each. For each year, we sampled 100 sequences from each lineage (or used all sequences if 100 or fewer were available) to limit the number of pairwise calculations. To estimate how much B/Yamagata and B/Victoria evolved since the late 1980s, we calculated percent amino acid differences between each B/Yamagata and B/Victoria sequence, and the corresponding HA and NA sequences of reference strains B/Yamagata/16/88 and B/Victoria/2/87. Unlike in the analysis of pairwise divergence within each time point, we used all sequences from each lineage in each year. We excluded sites in which one or both sequences had gaps or ambiguous amino acids.To compare HA and NA divergence between influenza B lineages with divergence between influenza A subtypes, we downloaded complete HA and NA sequences from H3N2 and H1N1 isolated since 1977 and available on GISAID in August 2019. Homologous sites in the HA of H3N2 and H1N1 are difficult to identify by conventional sequence alignment, and instead we used the algorithm by Burke and Smith71 implemented on the Influenza Research Database website72. Both H3N2 and H1N1 sequences were aligned with the reference H3N2 sequence A/Aichi/2/68. We verified that this method matched sites on the stalk and head of the H1N1 HA with sites on the stalk and head of H3N2 HA by comparing the resulting alignment with the alignment in Supplementary Fig. S2 of Kirkpatrick et al.73. To limit the total number of influenza A sequences analyzed, we randomly selected 100 H3N2 and 100 H1N1 sequences for years in which more than 100 sequences were available, and used all available sequences for the remaining years. Isolates A/Canterbury/58/2000, A/Canterbury/87/2000, and A/Canterbury/55/2000 were excluded, because both H1N1-like and H3N2-like sequences were available under the same isolate name on GISAID.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Here, we compare the humoral and cellular immunologic responses in a subset of participants receiving influenza vaccination by MNP to the intramuscular (IM) route of administration. We collected serum, plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 22 participants up to 180 days post-vaccination. Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers and antibody avidity were similar after MNP and IM vaccination, even though MNP vaccination used a lower antigen dose. MNPs generated higher neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) titers for all three influenza virus vaccine strains tested and triggered a larger percentage of circulating T follicular helper cells (CD4 + CXCR5 + CXCR3 + ICOS + PD-1+) compared to the IM route. Our study indicates that inactivated influenza virus vaccination by MNP produces humoral and cellular immune response that are similar or greater than IM vaccination.

More than half a million hospitalizations and 12,000 to 61,000 deaths occur in the United States alone2. Seasonal influenza vaccination remains the most effective way of preventing influenza infection. A better understanding of the immunologic mechanisms of influenza virus vaccines3 is needed to overcome their limited effectiveness (10–60%)4. Improving immune responses could be achieved by higher antigen doses5, use of adjuvants6, or alternative routes of immunization7.Targeting the skin as a route of immunization may be better at stimulating B and T cells than traditional vaccination routes by utilizing the high density of dendritic cells and extensive microvascular and lymphatic networks facilitating migration of antigen-presenting cells to the regional lymph nodes8. Delivery to the skin has been effective for many vaccines; most notably, the use of scarification for smallpox vaccine resulted in the worldwide eradication of this highly virulent disease. In addition to the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination against tuberculosis9, the intradermal route is also approved for the delivery of seasonal influenza virus vaccine, which allowed for antigen sparing10,11 and improvement of immunogenicity when equivalent doses of antigens have been compared (15 µg of HA per strain) between the intradermal and intramuscular (IM) routes12. Novel skin delivery modalities have targeted the vaccine delivery both intradermally and transdermally13. However, to date, the use of skin delivery systems has been hampered by the lack of appropriate vaccine delivery systems combining reliability, safety, and simplicity of use.Microneedle patches (MNPs) are micron-scale, solid, conical structures made of dissolvable excipients or solid projections coated with vaccine that deliver vaccine antigens across the stratum corneum into the viable epidermis and dermis14,15,16,17,18. MNPs provide an alternative to traditional IM injection of influenza virus vaccine, especially for needle-phobic patients19 and offer multiple potential advantages20,21: simplicity (amenable to self-vaccination, distribution, and storage outside the cold chain, such as on the pharmacy shelf), potential for dose sparing, cost effectiveness (reducing costs of vaccine administration, cold chain, and sharps waste disposal)22, and safety (eliminating needle-stick injuries with non-sharps waste). When tested in animal models23 and compared to other systemic influenza virus vaccine delivery modalities, the MNPs can induce higher neutralizing antibody responses, higher protective immunity against lethal challenges of influenza viruses24, broader cross-reactive protection25, longer-lasting protection25, and dose sparing effect26.In 2015–2016, a first-in-human, phase 1 clinical trial on the use of a dissolvable MNP for trivalent seasonal influenza virus immunization showed that the use of the MNPs was well tolerated, safe, had higher acceptability, and was strongly preferred by participants over conventional IM influenza vaccine administration27. The use of MNPs resulted in robust antibody responses measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) that were at least as strong as IM injection for all vaccine strains, particularly for the influenza B virus strain. In that study, the immune response was characterized only in terms of HAI titers. Here, we report the exploratory results of a broader immunological analysis of the phase 1 clinical trial in a subset of participants comparing the humoral and cellular immunologic mechanisms of inactivated influenza virus vaccine administered either using MNPs or hypodermic needles.ResultsStudy participants, demographicsFrom June 23rd to September 25th, 2015, 100 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to study intervention. Detailed immunologic analyses were performed on the group receiving 2014–2015 inactivated influenza virus vaccine (IIV) by MNP (n = 11) versus IM route (n = 11), both delivered by a healthcare worker (Supplementary Fig. 1). The demographics of the groups were comparable: 50% of participants were female, 41% were non-white (Table 1). Ages ranged between 21 and 46, with a median of 26.5 years (IQR: 24.3, 32.0).Table 1 Demographic characteristics of participants (n = 22)a.Full size tableSerological immune responsesWe found that HAI responses to MNP and IM immunization were similar at 1 and 6 months after vaccination, and that HAI responses were higher at 1 month than at 6 months (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1). There was no difference between the MNP and IM groups in HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs) for the H1N1, H3N2, and B strains at baseline or 1 and 6 months after vaccination. The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) was higher for the B strain for the MNP group but not for other strains (P = 0.009). There was no difference in the Day 180-to-baseline GMT ratio between any strain or any group (H1N1: P = 0.33; H3N2: P = 0.29; B: P = 0.29). Seroprotection rates were similar between the groups with 100% at Day 28 for all strains and 82–100% when measured 6 months after vaccination (P = 1.00). Seroconversion at Day 28 for all strains varied between 55 and 82% for the MNP group and between 18 and 82% for the IM group, but these rates were not significantly different from each other (H1N1: P = 1.00; H3N2: P = 1.00; B: P = 0.18). The seroconversion dropped remarkably at Day 180 compared to Day 28 and was only present in some participants in the MNP group for H1N1 (46%) and H3N2 (18%) strains, and only in a few participants in the IM group only for the H1N1 strain (27%), but the differences between MNP and IM groups were not significant (P = 0.66). HAI responses in the substudy align with those previously observed in the complete study dataset27.Fig. 1: Fold change of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean titers (GMT) (log2) over baseline level at Day 28 and Day 180 following vaccination against A/Christchurch/16/2010, NIB-74 (H1N1), A/Texas/50/2012, NYMC X-223 (H3N2), B/Massachusetts/2/2012, NYMC BX-51(B) strains for MNP (n = 11) and IM (n = 11) groups with geometric standard error (vertical bars).Black lines indicate statistical significance based on Wilcoxon rank-sum test. **P < 0.01. IM, IIV by intramuscular route; MNP, IIV by microneedle patch; D, Day.Full size imageWhile HAI has been routinely used to assess vaccine immunogenicity, lately neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) assays have been proposed as an independent correlate of protection28,29. Unlike HAI measurements, NAI responses were often different after MNP vaccination compared to IM (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2). At baseline, there was no difference between the groups in NAI GMTs, with the exception of the N1 strain where the GMT for the IM group was higher than the GMT for the MNP group (P = 0.04) (Supplementary Table 2). Interestingly, the fold changes between Day 28 and baseline for NAI GMTs were higher for N1 (P = 0.002), N2 (P = 0.003), and B (P < 0.001) strains after vaccination by MNP when compared to IM (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2). These results were also observed at Day 180 (N1: P = 0.05; B: P = 0.02) with the exception of the N2 strain (P = 0.11).Fig. 2: Fold change of neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) geometric mean titers (GMT) (log2) over baseline level at Day 28 and Day 180 following vaccination.Testing was performed against H6N1, H6N2, and H6NB strains for MNP (n = 8) and IM (n = 11) groups with geometric standard error (vertical bars).

IM, IIV by intramuscular route; MNP, IIV by microneedle patch; D, Day.Full size imageWe also measured antibody affinity by analyzing the antigen–antibody complex dissociation kinetics (off-rates) bound to H1N1pdm09 HA1 (globular head). Antibody affinity could be of clinical significance as high levels of low avidity antibodies in infected individuals were associated with severe H1N1pdm09 disease30. Pre-vaccination off-rates varied among participants ranging between 10−2 s−1 and 10−3 s−1 (Fig. 3) and were comparable between groups (P = 0.65). Increase in binding affinities was observed within both the MNP and IM groups at Day 28 post vaccination when compared to baseline (P = 0.002; P = 0.01, respectively).Fig. 3: Changes in antibody binding affinity at Day 28 post vaccination by vaccine delivery group (MNP: n = 10; IM: n = 11).SPR analysis of human plasma from various vaccine cohorts was performed with functional rHA1.

However, for TNF-α (P = 0.04), the level was higher for the IM group compared to the MNP group at Days 2–3 when compared to baseline. When Day 8 values were compared to baseline for the following cytokines: IL-8 (P = 0.02); IL-5 (P = 0.034); IL-13 (P = 0.013) and MIP-1b (P = 0.016) they were all higher for the MNP group (Fig. 4). After adjusting for multiple comparisons via Bonferroni correction, none of these findings remain statistically significant. Other changes in cytokines and chemokines over baseline values did not differ significantly between groups, including IL-6 and MIP-1 alpha.Fig. 4: Statistically significant fold changes in cytokines/chemokines following vaccination.Fold changes at a Day 2 and b Day 8 post vaccination by vaccine delivery group (MNP: n = 8; IM: n = 11).

Relative to baseline, there was a numerical increase in the median percentage of vaccine-induced IL-2 + CD40L + CD4+ T cells at Day 8 in the MNP group [0.32% (IQR: 0.16, 0.37)] compared to the IM group [0.11% (IQR: 0.06, 0.21)], but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.07) (Fig. 6). No significant change of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-21 was detected over baseline.Fig. 6: IL-2 secreting CD4+ T cells after vaccination.a Representative FACS plot showing CD3 + CD4+ T cells expressing CD154 (CD40L) and IL-2 by ICS assay. b Percentage of vaccine-induced IL-2 + CD40L + CD4+ T cells at Day 8 by vaccine delivery group (MNP: n = 8; IM: n = 8).

These T cells express the chemokine receptor CXCR5 and co-stimulatory molecules ICOS and PD-1, and thus belong to a circulating compartment of TFH cells. There was a higher percentage of cTFH (CD4 + CXCR5 + CXCR3 + ICOS + PD-1+) at Day 8 post vaccination in the MNP group [2.48% (IQR: 1.9, 6.8))] compared to the IM group [0.96% (IQR: 0.8, 2.5)] (P = 0.04) (Fig. 7).Fig. 7: Circulating T follicular helper (cTFH) cells after vaccination.a Representative FACS plot showing ICOS and PD-1 co-expressing CD3 + CD4 + CXCR5 + CXCR3 + cTFH cells. b Temporal cells at baseline and days 2–3, 8, and 28 post vaccination. c Percentage of cTFH (CD4 + CXCR5 + CXCR3 + ICOS + PD-1+) at Day 8 post vaccination by vaccine delivery group (MNP: n = 8; IM: n = 9).

While immunologic advantages of MNPs as a novel vaccine delivery method have been demonstrated in animal models, the current study is one of few to highlight the unique immunologic features of MNPs in humans in the setting of influenza virus vaccination, other than dose sparing18,34.Immune responses induced by available IIV vaccines primarily target the immunodominant globular head domain of the HA which is responsible for viral attachment and fusion. The HAI assay, measuring the antibodies to the HA head, is considered a surrogate correlate of protection and used in the evaluation of vaccines for licensure35; however, an HAI titer of 40 only provides a 50% putative protective threshold in adults36. In addition, HA head-specific antibodies do not reflect the whole spectrum of protective antibodies. Blocking neuraminidase (NA), another major surface glycoprotein, is an effective way to inhibit viral infection replication and shedding37. Antibodies against NA have been shown to confer protection from natural influenza virus infection28,29 as well as in an influenza challenge model38 and to shorten the duration of shedding and symptoms39. Therefore, NAI assay is being considered as an independent correlate of protection40,41. Interestingly, the MNPs were able to induce a better NAI responses at Days 28 and 180 when compared to baseline in comparison to the IM route.Intradermal vaccination directly targets epidermal Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells, which are essential for efficient cellular and humoral responses42. In our study, MNPs showed an early increase in IP-1043, MIP-1b, and IL-8 compared to baseline that was statistically higher than the IM route with a trend toward a higher proinflammatory monocyte responses 2–3 days after vaccination. Interestingly, higher levels of allergic inflammation IL-5 and IL-13 were noted in the MNP group, which could explain the local transient pruritus reported by a subset of vaccinees27.Though antibodies have been the hallmark of protection against influenza vaccines and infection, CD4+ T cells confer protection too44,45. Pre-existing CD4+ T cells result in lower virus shedding and less severe influenza symptoms in experimental A/H3N2 human challenge44 and natural infection with A/H1N1pdm45 in the absence of protective antibodies. In our study, MNPs did not lead to a better HA-specific IL-2 + CD154(CD40L) + CD4+ T cells response at Day 8 relative to baseline when compared with the response seen with IIV administered IM.In addition, the interactions between CD4+ T cells and B cells promote both extrafollicular responses that generate short-lived, class-switched antibody-secreting cells as well as germinal center reactions through cTFH that result in long-lived, affinity-matured antibody-secreting cells and memory B cells46.There are limitations to this study. A major limitation is the small group sizes typical for a phase 1 study and availability of samples. The lack of difference in HAI GMT between the different delivery routes could have been due to pre-existing antibodies linked to reduced humoral and effector B cell responses after vaccination47,48 making it difficult to compare our results with other studies where the majority of the participants had lower pre-existing antibodies18,34. Detecting differences in immune profiles between the different routes of delivery might have been easier in naive individuals (young children)49, where strong immunologic advantages of influenza vaccination by MNP compared to the IM route have been seen in a young mouse model50.There was a difference between the HA quantity in the vaccines delivered by IM versus MNPs, with 15–37% lower quantities delivered by MNPs27. Despite this, MNP delivery still showed similar HAI as well as superior NAI and cTFH cell responses highlights another advantage of MNPs with regard to antigen sparing. While the HA quantity in seasonal influenza virus vaccine is at least 15 µg per strain, the quantity and quality of NA included in the vaccine are not standardized51. We measured the quantity of HA administered by the MNPs, but did not measure the quantity of NA in either vaccine type, though both the IM doses and the monobulk used to prepare the MNPs were provided by the manufacturer, so we would expect the ratio of HA-to-NA to be the same in MNP and IM formulations.Memory B cell responses in our study were measured early, 28 days after vaccination, and did not show any difference between the groups; assessing these responses at a later timepoint (4–6 months) may have revealed differences in the groups. In addition, CD8+ T cells play an important role in influenza virus immunity. Due to limitation in availability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in our samples, we were unable to conduct these assays.In addition, an extended immunological analysis was not performed on any subject who received the placebo MNP in the trial. It is not possible therefore to determine if any of the responses observed were due to the application of the dissolving MNP rather than being due to delivery of the influenza antigen.In summary, the use of MNPs for influenza virus vaccination offers both logistical advantages as well as promising immunologic advantages reported here and elsewhere. Our study showed higher cTFH cells along with higher NA function in participants vaccinated with MNPs when compared to the traditional IM needle and syringe.MethodsParticipantsThe partially blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study recruited 100 healthy non-pregnant, immunocompetent adults aged 18–49 years who had not previously received the influenza virus vaccine during the 2014–15 influenza season. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02438423; date of registration: May 8, 2015) and have been previously described elsewhere27.Randomization and study groupsParticipants, who consented for the substudy, were randomly assigned to receive either IIV by MNP or by IM injection, in each case administered by a healthcare worker. In addition, there was a group that received placebo by MNP and another group that received IIV by MNP self-administered by study participants. As the main objective of the phase 1 trial was to compare IIV vaccination by MNP and IM, both applied by healthcare worker, the substudy compared these two groups for detailed immunologic analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). Laboratory testing was performed in a blinded manner.VaccinesThe licensed 2014–15 seasonal trivalent IIV (Fluvirin) was kindly provided by Seqirus (Cambridge, MA) in single-dose, prefilled syringes for IM injection containing the following three influenza vaccine strains: A/Christchurch/16/2010, NIB-74 (H1N1); A/Texas/50/2012, NYMC X-223 (H3N2); and B/Massachusetts/2/2012, NYMC BX-51(B). The MNPs were designed at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta, GA) and manufactured by the Global Center for Medical Innovation (Atlanta, GA) under Phase 1 Good Manufacturing Practice. The antigen incorporated into the MNPs was also provided by Seqirus and comprised the same three vaccine strains. The formulation and fabrication methods have been previously described52.IM was administered by hypodermic needle in the deltoid muscle of the arm preferred by the participant and the MNPs were manually applied to the dorsal aspect of the wrist of the non-dominant arm and left on the skin for 20 min.Assessment of vaccine deliveryThe difference between the antigen content measured by single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) assay of unused MNPs (i.e., 18 μg hemagglutinin (HA) per vaccine strain) and that of the residual antigen content of the 11 MNPs used in the substudy showed that the mean HA dose delivered by MNPs was 10.8 μg (Standard Error (SE) 1.1) for the H1N1 strain, 14.4 μg (SE 0.8) for the H3N2 strain, and 13.3 μg (SE 0.6) for the B strain27. Our measurements also showed that the IM injection administered 18 μg of HA per H1N1 vaccine strain, 17 μg of HA per H3N2 vaccine strain, and 15 μg of HA per B vaccine strain with a delivery efficiency of 60%, 85%, and 89%, respectively. Mean dose delivered by each strain significantly differed between MNP and IM groups (H1N1: p < 0.001; H3N2: p = 0.013; B: p = 0.018).Blood samplesBlood samples for the substudy were collected at Days 0 (pre-vaccination), 2–3, 8–10, 26–30, and 166–194 days post vaccination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated from sodium citrate whole blood using a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient and stored in a liquid nitrogen tank. Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed in a 37 °C water bath and washed. Before use, cells were counted and checked for viability by Trypan blue dye exclusion.Hemagglutination inhibition assayWe used reference strains contained in the 2014–15 trivalent influenza virus vaccine: H1N1 virus reference strain A/Christchurch/16/2010 (#10/216, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, UK), H3N2 A/Texas/50/2012 (#FR1210), and B virus reference strain B/Massachusetts/2/2012 (#FR1196, Influenza Reagent Resource of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, https://www.internationalreagentresource.org). Influenza viruses were propagated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK).2 cells and MDCK.2 SIAT1 cells in the presence of tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). HAI assays were previously performed and described27.Neuraminidase inhibition assayH6NX reassortant influenza A viruses were generated by reverse genetics as described previously53. These viruses contain the HA (H6) gene from influenza Aurkey/Massachusetts/3740/1965 (H6N2) virus, gene segments encoding internal proteins from influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus, and one of the following NA gene segments: N1 of A/California/04/2009 (H1N1); N2 of A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) or influenza B NA of B/Yamagata/16/198854. H6NX viruses were propagated in 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs at 37 °C for 2 days.To determine the ideal stock virus concentration to be used in the NAI assay, an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) was first performed for all reassortant H6NX viruses. In brief, 96-well microtiter plates (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) were coated with 100 μL/well fetuin (Sigma) at a concentration of 25 μg/mL in PBS and stored at 4 °C. The next day, the plates were washed three times with T-PBS [PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma)] and blocked in 200 μL blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in PBS) at room temperature for at least 1 h. On a separate cell culture 96-well plate, virus was serially diluted 1:2 in PBS and added to the fetuin-coated plate. The plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and washed four times with T-PBS. Peanut agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (PNA-HRP, Sigma) at a concentration of 5 µg/mL diluted in PBS was added to the plate (100 µL per well) and incubated in the dark for 1.5 h at room temperature. The plate was developed with 100 µL o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (SigmaFast) and the reaction stopped after 5 min with 50 μL 3 M hydrochloric acid (Thermo Fisher). The plate was read at a wavelength of 490 nm with a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). The data were fitted to a nonlinear regression curve (four parameters) to determine the effective concentration 50 (EC50) of the different viruses.Working stocks of each H6NX virus were prepared by diluting the virus stock to two times the EC50.To perform the NAI assays, the microtiter plates were coated and blocked as described above. In the first row of a cell culture 96-well plate, 150 µl of 1:20 pre-diluted and pre-treated human serum was added. The human sera were pre-treated with RDE (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) to reduce non-specific background inhibition. In all other wells, 75 µl PBS was added. The sera were serially diluted two-fold by transferring 75 µl into the next row. Then, 75 μL of virus working stock (2× EC50) was added to wells of the serially diluted human sera and incubated for 1.5 h on a shaker. The fetuin-coated plates were washed three times with T-PBS and the virus/serum mixture was added to the plates and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The remainder of the assay was performed as described above. The data were fitted to a nonlinear regression curve (four parameters) and the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) was calculated for all human serum samples individually. Sample sizes available for statistical analysis differed based on sample availability (MNP: n = 8; IM: n = 11).Serum antibodies binding assayThe DNA gene segments corresponding to the HA1 proteins of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09) virus were cloned as NotI-PacI inserts into a T7 promoter based pSK expression vector in which the desired polypeptide can be expressed as a fusion protein with His6 tag at the C-terminus. E. coli Rosetta Gami cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) were used for expression of HA1 proteins. Following expression, inclusion bodies were isolated by cell lysis and multiple washing steps, denatured, refolding in redox-folding buffer, and dialyzed. The dialysate was filtered through a 0.45 µm filter and purified by HisTrap Fast flow chromatography (information on instrument/materials). The purified proteins were characterized by the presence of oligomers by gel-filtration chromatography and by functional binding to turkey RBCs in a hemagglutination assay.To confirm that the rHA1 proteins formed oligomers (similar to the native spike HAs on virions) hemagglutination assay was performed with human RBCs. The HA0 from H1N1pdm09 and the purified rHA1 proteins agglutinated RBC to various concentrations. We previously demonstrated that several recombinant HA1 domains produced using bacterial system resembled native viral HA in EM, formed functional trimers/oligomers that were fully immunogenic, generated high-affinity antibodies, and protected ferrets from influenza challenge with pandemic strains55,56,57,58. The HA1 domains could also adsorb the majority of neutralizing antibodies from post-vaccination polyclonal antibodies in human plasma.Steady-state equilibrium binding of post-vaccination sera was monitored at 25 °C using a ProteOn surface plasmon resonance biosensor (SPR, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The rHA1 protein is coupled to a GLC sensor chip with amine coupling with 500 resonance units (RU) in the test flow cells. Samples prepared at 10-, 50-, and/or 250-fold dilutions were injected at a flow rate of 50 µL/min (120-s contact time) for association, and dissociation performed over a 600 s interval (at a flow rate of 50 µL/min). Responses from the protein surface were corrected for the response from a mock surface and for responses from a separate, buffer-only injection. MAb 2D7 (anti-CCR5) was used as a negative control. Antibody off-rate constants, which describe the fraction of antigen–antibody complexes that decay per second, were determined directly from the plasma sample interaction with rHA1 using SPR in the dissociation phase only for the sensorgrams with Max RU in the range of 20–150 RU and calculated using the BioRad ProteOn manager software for the heterogeneous sample model as described before. Off-rate constants were determined from two independent SPR runs. Sample sizes available for statistical analysis differed based on sample availability (MNP: n = 10; IM: n = 11).Innate and T-cell phenotyping assaysMonoclonal antibodies used for staining of PBMCs for innate cell phenotyping were CD3 (UCHT1, #557943), CD19 (HIB19, #557921), CD14 (M5E2, #565283), HLA-DR (G46-6, #560651), CD11c (O33-782, #561355), and CD123 (7G3,554529) from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ), CD56 (MEM188,17-0569) and CD16 (CB16,47-0168) from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA); for cTFH phenotyping CD3 (SP34-2, #562877), CD4 (L200, #560836), CXCR5 (RF8B2), and CXCR3 (IC6/CXCR3) BD Biosciences, ICOS (C398.4 A) and PD-1 (EH12.2H7) from Biolegend (San Diego, CA) (Supplementary Fig. 2). Data were collected on an LSRII (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed using R 3.6.3 software. Sample sizes available for statistical analysis differed based on sample availability (monocytes—MNP: n = 7; IM = 10, cTFH—MNP: n = 8; IM: n = 9).Influenza virus-specific CD4+ T cells by intracellular cytokine assay (ICS)Peptide pools consisting of 15-mers with 11 amino acid overlaps spanning 3 HA proteins in the vaccine were synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed in a 37 °C water bath and washed. Cells were counted and checked for viability by Trypan blue dye exclusion and rested overnight at incubator 37 °C with 5% CO2 and then incubated with virus peptide pools at final concentrations of 2 μg/mL of each peptide in the presence of CD28 and CD49d (BD Biosciences, #340957 and #340976). Negative control samples were left un-stimulated in culture medium, and positive control samples were treated with Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (Sigma) at a final concentration of 1 μg/mL. Cells were cultured for 2 h at 37 °C, and then a cocktail containing brefeldin A and monensin was added (eBioscience, #004980-93), followed by a 4 h culture. Cells were washed with 1xPBS; surface stained with Aqua live/dead stain L423102 (Biolegend), and then fixed and permeabilized using a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences; 554722). The cells were then stained with the following fluorescence conjugated antibodies: CD3(SP34-2), CD4(L200), IL-2 (MQ1-17H12, #554567), and TNF-α (MAB11, #550679) from BD Biosciences; and IFN-γ (4 S.B3, #47-731942) and IL-21 (2A3-N2) from eBioSciences. After the cells were washed, data were collected on an LSRII Fortessa instrument (BD Biosciences). Compensation was performed using tubes of CompBeads (BD Biosciences, # 51-90-9001229) individually stained with each fluorophore and compensation matrices were calculated with FACSdiva. Data were analyzed using Flowjo software. Sample sizes available for statistical analysis differed based on sample availability (MNP: n = 8; IM: n = 8).Memory B cell analysis by enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) assayRecombinant influenza virus HA proteins of A/Christchurch/16/2011 (H1N1) pdm09 (NR-42487) and neuraminidase (NA) Protein from A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) (NR-43784) were provided by BEI Resources (Manassas, VA). HA of A/Victoria/361/2011/H3N2 (FR-1059) was provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention International Reagent Resource (Manassas, VA). Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and checked for viability as described above. Memory B cell assays were performed as previously described59. In brief, PBMCs were plated in 24-well dishes at 5 × 105 cells/well in R-10 medium supplemented with IL-2 and R488 (CTL-hBPOLYS-200, CTL) plus antigens for 6 days. For ELISpot, 96-well filter plates (Millipore, #MSHAN4B50) were coated 0.1 µg per well of HA proteins or 1 µg per well of anti-human IgG. The plates were left to adsorb overnight at 4 °C, washed four times in PBS, and incubated in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. RPMI was removed, and PBMCs suspended in RPMI with 10% FBS were placed in each well with threefold dilutions. Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight, then were washed twice with PBS followed by four times in PBS with Tween® 20 (PBST) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with biotinylated anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory, #709065098) diluted 1:1000 in PBST with 2% FBS. Plates were washed four times in PBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with streptavidin-HRP (Vector Laboratories #A 2004) diluted 1:1000 in PBST with 2% FBS. Plates were washed four times each in PBST, then with PBS, followed with incubation with 3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrate kit (EMD Millipore Corporation, Substrate #152226, Buffer #152224) for 10 min until spot development. Plates were washed with water and allowed to dry; images were obtained using a CTL ELISpot plate reader. Data are presented as the percentage of influenza virus-specific IgG-secreting cells among total IgG-secreting cells. Sample sizes available for statistical analysis differed based on sample availability (MNP: n = 10, IM: n = 11).Cytokines and chemokinesCytokines tested included IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40/p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-γ, GM-CSF, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, IP-10, MIG, Eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-1. Human 25-plex cytokine kits (Cat # LHC0009M) were purchased from Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA) for Luminex assays and used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations with modifications. Beads were added to a 96-well plate and washed in a Biotek ELx405 washer. Samples were added to the plate containing the mixed antibody-linked beads and incubated at room temperature for 1 h followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Cold and room temperature incubation steps were performed on an orbital shaker at 500–600 rpm. Following the overnight incubation, plates were washed in a Biotek ELx405 washer and then biotinylated detection antibody added for 75 min at room temperature with shaking. Plates were washed again as above and streptavidin-PE was added. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, wash was performed as above and reading buffer was added to the wells. Each sample was measured in duplicate. Plates were read using a Luminex LX 100 instrument with a lower bound of 50 beads per sample per cytokine. As cytokine changes are observed early after vaccination, we measured cytokine levels 2–3 days and 8–10 days after vaccination and compared them to pre-vaccination levels. Sample sizes available for statistical analysis differed based on sample availability (MNP: n = 8, IM: n = 11).StatisticsDescriptive statistics of the population at enrollment were compared using Student’s t test for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. The immunogenicity population included all participants who provided serum samples at baseline and at least 28 or 180 days after study product administration (MNP: n = 11, IM: n = 11). GMT of HAI and NAI antibodies were determined for each strain and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were based on the normal distribution of log-transformed data. Mann–Whitney Wilcoxon tests were used to compare MNP and IM groups. We adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction.The proportion of participants achieving seroprotection (defined as a HAI antibody titer of 1:40 or greater) and seroconversion (defined as a minimum four-fold increase in post-vaccination HAI and NAI antibody titer) ~28 days following receipt of study products were determined for each strain in the MNP and IM groups. Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals were calculated, and chi-square tests were used to compare frequencies of seroprotection and seroconversion between each group. For all cellular assays, median percentage and IQR were reported and Mann–Whitney Wilcoxon tests were used to compare MNP and IM groups.All statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical software version 3.6.3 and a two-sided p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Study approvalAll participants provided written informed consent for participation in the study before enrollment. The study was approved by the Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology institutional review boards.

Nevertheless, there is no exact standardized protocol to prevent a possible reaction after a vaccine injection, especially for patients who have already presented a previous vaccine-related adverse event, considering that these patients frequently tolerate future vaccine doses. For this reason, we aim to share our experience at Meyer Children’s University Hospital in Florence to raise awareness on the potential risk for future vaccinations and to discuss the valuable therapeutic strategies intended to prevent them, taking into account what is proposed by experts in literature. We describe the case of an 18-month-old female affected by a polymorphic variant of maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis that presented an extensive bullous cutaneous reaction 24 hours after the second dose (booster dose) of inactivated-tetravalent influenza vaccine, treated with a single dose of oral corticosteroid therapy with betamethasone (0.1 mg/kg) and an oral antihistamine therapy with oxatomide (1 mg/kg/daily) for a week, until resolution. To the best of our knowledge, in the literature, no documented case of reaction to influenza vaccine in maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis is described. Subsequently, the patient started a background therapy with ketotifen daily (0.05 mg/kg twice daily), a non-competitive H1-antihistamine, and a mast cell stabilizer (dual activity). A non-standardized pharmacological premedication protocol with an H1-receptor antagonist (oxatomide, 0.5 mg/kg) administered 12 hours before the immunizations, and a single dose of betamethasone (0.05 mg/kg) together with another dose of oxatomide (0.5 mg/kg) administered 2 hours before the injections was followed to make it possible for the patient to continue with the scheduled vaccinations. Indeed, no reactions were subsequently reported. Thus, in our experience, a background therapy with ketotifen associated with a premedication protocol made by two doses of oxatomide and a single dose of betamethasone was helpful to make possible the execution of the other vaccines. We suggest how in these children, it could be considered the idea of taking precaution when vaccination is planned, regardless of the kind of vaccine and if a dose of the same vaccine was previously received. However, international consensus needs to be reached to manage vaccinations in children with mastocytosis and previous adverse reactions to vaccines.IntroductionThe term “mastocytosis” defines a various group of disorders characterized by an increase of mast cells in cutaneous tissue and different organs such as bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal tract (1, 2). The organs most frequently involved are skin and bone marrow (2, 3). Mast cells’ uncontrolled proliferation is mainly associated with gaining function mutations in c-KIT, the gene that encodes for a tyrosine kinase receptor expressed by mast cells (4, 5). Disease manifestations are mostly linked to mast-cell-derived mediators’ release, especially histamine, and include pruritus, flushing, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, and rarely anaphylaxis (6, 7). The typical Darier’s sign refers to the development of a wheal-and-flare reaction after a few minutes of scratching or rubbing a cutaneous lesion, due to the release of vasoactive mediators (8).The current classification of mastocytosis, recently updated by World Health Organization in 2016, identifies three major disease groups: cutaneous mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis, and mast-cell sarcoma (9, 10).The classification of cutaneous mastocytosis is subcategorized based on the macroscopic features of the skin lesions, their distribution, and onset into three groups: maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM), formerly known as urticaria pigmentosa (furtherly sub-dived in monomorphic and polymorphic types), diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM), and mastocytoma of the skin (3, 9).In children, mastocytosis is commonly limited to the skin, has a favorable prognosis, and improves spontaneously by the mid-teenage years. On the contrary, adult mastocytosis is usually systemic and may have a chronic or aggressive course (7, 9, 11).The most frequent type of pediatric mastocytosis is MPCM, specifically the polymorphic variant, followed by the cutaneous isolated mastocytoma and then the diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (9). Mastocytosis can appear at all ages but, it is possible to identify two incidence peaks: early childhood (65%) and young adulthood (35%). Focusing on the pediatric age, about 15% are connatal forms, 30% appear in the first 6 months of life, and the others between 2 and 15 years (7).Patients affected by mastocytosis present a greater risk than the general population for anaphylaxis. The main cause of anaphylaxis in pediatric mastocytosis is idiopathic, followed by some stimuli such as foods, medications, and Hymenoptera venoms. The latter ones represent a rare cause of anaphylaxis in pediatric mastocytosis, while they represent the most common triggers in adult patients. In pediatric mastocytosis, the risk of anaphylaxis is related to the extent and the density of lesions. Elevated basal serum tryptase levels, systemic disease, KIT D816V mutation, and previous episodes of anaphylaxis represent other suggested risk factors. For this reason, it can be considered reasonable to provide these children with extensive disease and/or previous anaphylaxis with an emergency autoinjector of epinephrine (12, 13).Vaccination is a well-known trigger for mast cell degranulation in subjects affected by mastocytosis. Nevertheless, there is no exact standardized protocol to prevent a possible reaction after a vaccine injection, especially for patients who have already presented a previous vaccine-related adverse event, considering that these patients frequently tolerate future vaccine doses. For this reason, we aim to share our experience at Meyer Children’s University Hospital in Florence to raise awareness on the potential risk for future vaccinations and to discuss the valuable therapeutic strategies intended to prevent them, taking into account what is proposed by experts in literature.Case ReportA female child of 18 months, affected by a polymorphic variant of MPCM, was presented to our attention following a significant diffuse bullous cutaneous reaction 24 hours after the injection of the second dose (booster dose) of the inactivated tetravalent influenza vaccine (Figure 1).FIGURE 1 Figure 1 (A) Initial bullous skin eruption involving the back of the patient after 24 hours from the second dose of the influenza vaccine; (B) Bullous lesions presented on the left foot of the patient after 24 hours from the second dose of the influenza vaccine.Before this event, the patient did not present any cutaneous reactions to the injection of the other vaccinations scheduled in Italy for this age group, although fever was frequently reported after most of these immunizations (Table 1).TABLE 1 Table 1 Vaccines received by the patient in accordance to the Italian scheduled vaccinations.Hence, the patient was addressed to our center with the primary purpose of continuing the scheduled vaccinations in a hospital clinical setting. In her family history, no other cases of mastocytosis were reported. The older sister was affected by atopic dermatitis, and the mother had a history of reaction to penicillins. No other significant disorders, except for mastocytosis, were mentioned in her personal medical history.At the age of 8 months, a first isolated mastocytoma appeared on the neck followed by more lesions, heterogeneous in shape and size, brownish-yellowish, on the head, chest, back, and legs. Sometimes, blisters occurred within the existing lesions. The diagnosis of polymorphic MPCM was made at the age of 9 months, after a dermatological evaluation that pointed out the characteristic skin lesions. During the physical exam, a gentle rubbing of a chest lesion revealed a prominent Darier’s sign associated with flushing of the face, neck, and chest. The serum tryptase level subsequently evaluated was within normal limits at 4.1 mcg/L. No skin biopsy was performed.At the age of 13 months, the patient received her first dose of influenza vaccine, and only a 2-day fever with no cutaneous involvement was reported. One month later, the patient received the second dose of inactivated-tetravalent influenza vaccine, and after 24 hours from the injection, she presented an extensive bullous skin eruption involving the face, head, chest, shoulder, back, hands, and feet (Figure 1). No blisters were present before the immunization. Moreover, she showed significant irritability and generalized pruritus. The adverse reaction was promptly treated with a single dose of oral betamethasone (0.1 mg/kg) and an oral antihistamine therapy with oxatomide (1 mg/kg/daily) for a week, with the complete resolution of the lesions.After 6 days from the resolution of the clinical manifestations, another evaluation of serum tryptase level was made, showing results within normal limits (2 mcg/L). After this adverse reaction, parents refused the next Italian scheduled vaccination with the third dose of 13-valent Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). The patient was later addressed by our Allergy Unit thanks to the parents’ desire to catch up with the scheduled vaccination in a hospital clinical setting.After a clinical evaluation of the patient, we planned the third dose of the PCV13 after 2 weeks from the first visit. Until that day, the patient assumed a background therapy with ketotifen (0.05 mg/kg twice daily), a non-competitive H1-antihistamine, and a mast cell stabilizer (dual activity). Furthermore, 12 hours before the injection, the patient assumed oxatomide (0.5 mg/kg), and 2 hours before the injection, she assumed the same dose of oxatomide together with a single dose of betamethasone (0.05 mg/kg). We decided not to perform a patch test to evaluate a possible delayed reaction to a component of the vaccine because of the possibility of provoking mastocytes degranulation. After 2 hours of observation from the injection, the patient did not present any cutaneous or systemic clinical manifestations. The patient was discharged with instructions to continue the therapy with ketotifen (0.05 mg/kg twice daily).Afterward, the patient continued the same background therapy with ketotifen until the varicella vaccination, planned after 1 month. Similarly to the previous vaccination, the patient assumed oxatomide (0.5 mg/kg) 12 hours before the immunization and the same dose of oxatomide together with a single dose of betamethasone (0.05 mg/kg) 2 hours before the immunization. After the immunization, no adverse reactions were presented, including fever.DiscussionMPCM, the most common form of mastocytosis seen in childhood, is subdivided into two variants: polymorphic and monomorphic (9).In the polymorphic variant, lesions are larger and asymmetric, and they have a typical distribution that affects the head, neck, and extremities. The lesions can be red, brown, or yellow and appear flat or elevated with sharp or indistinct margins. Darier’s sign, pruritus, and dermographism are usually present, while blistering may occur, especially in children under 3 years old. Serum tryptase levels are usually in the normal range; rarely patients with pronounced lesions can present increased level that usually decreases within 1 or 2 years (8, 14). The prognosis is excellent, and usually, lesions resolve by adolescence (2).On the other side, the monomorphic variant is typical of adult age. The lesions are usually smaller, round, and similar. In these patients, serum tryptase levels can be persistently increased over time, and the disease tends to persist into adulthood with a higher risk of developing systemic mastocytosis (3, 8, 14).Mastocytoma is the second most common lesion in the pediatric population. It usually occurs in the form of a single lesion, yellow-brownish, with the frequent formation of pomphoid lesions, the possible formation of bullous skin eruptions, and regional or diffuse flushing after the mechanical stimulation of the lesion. It has a dynamic pattern and can increase by dimensions (but not number) and usually regress by mid-teenage years (14, 15). According to Hartmann et al., a maximum of three compatible lesions still should qualify as mastocytoma, while more than three lesions should be considered as attributable to a case of MPCM (3). The diagnosis is based exclusively on clinical manifestations, and serum tryptase levels are usually within the normal range (3, 14).DCM is characterized by diffuse infiltration of the dermis with mast cells, which results in generalized erythema and diffuse papules associated with pachydermia, darker skin, and accentuation of hair follicles “peau d’orange” (16). Dermographism and blistering are characterizing signs of disease (3, 8). Diagnosis is made by skin biopsy (16). DCM can resolve by adolescence, but sometimes progress toward systemic mastocytosis can be seen, usually accompanied by hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and bone marrow involvement (3, 8).With a complete inspection of the skin accompanied by Darier’s sign evaluation, the physical examination is critical to have an initial approach to the disease. A skin biopsy that shows evidence of compatible histological findings can confirm the diagnosis, even if, in the absence of them, a diagnosis cannot be ruled out (17). As concerns the laboratory test, a significant role is played by the serum level of tryptase. In cutaneous mastocytosis and isolated mastocytoma, serum levels of tryptase are usually within the standard limit. If a tryptase serum level >20 mcg/L is detected, without signs and symptoms of systemic involvement, the value should be considered in first place associated with a release of mediators by cutaneous mast cells. The evaluation of serum levels is indeed recommended after 24 hours from the resolution of a clinical event caused by mast cells degranulation. Anyway, periodic control of tryptase should be considered in order to rule out a progression of disease (18). The study of c-KIT mutation should be carried out in selected patients (8), while a bone marrow biopsy should be requested if systemic clinical manifestations, especially organomegaly, in conjunction with elevation of tryptase level are present (9, 19).Multiple pathways have been described in the activation and degranulation of mast cells. One important signaling pathway is induced by the high-affinity receptor for IgE, and it is involved in immediate allergic reactions. Other triggers for mast cell activation are known, and they involve certain cytokines, immune complexes, complement proteins, drugs (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids), radiocontrast media, products of bacteria, or parasites. Physical factors such as heat, cold, friction, stress, and physical effort can induce mast cell activation and act as cofactors in allergic and anaphylactic reactions (20, 21). In our experience, we indeed avoided these known cofactors of mast cell degranulation. The vaccine was kept out of the fridge for 2 hours to bring it to room temperature, and the injection was carefully carried out as not to rub the skin. The patient was quiet, and we knew that she was not assuming other medications, except for the ones that we prescribed, and that she did not have histamine liberators food.Vaccines may act as triggers in patients with mastocytosis, especially children. Indeed, some substances contained in vaccines, such as dextran, gelatin, and polymyxin B, may be responsible for this adverse reaction (22). However, literature does not specifically describe the pathway associated with mastocyte degranulation after immunization.An Italian study of 102 patients, including 35 children and 67 adults with mastocytosis, demonstrated no relationship between types of vaccines and risk of mast cell degranulation after immunization. Seven children in the study presented reactions after the immunization. Subsequently, some of these children tolerated the same vaccine components, strengthening the hypothesis on the possible role of variable triggers in determining reactions to vaccines in cases of mastocytosis (Table 2) (22).TABLE 2 Table 2 Clinical data about patients from the analyzed studies on vaccination and mastocytosis.Parente et al., supposed that mast cell activation could be induced by a component in vaccines that acts like a superantigen, which unspecifically binds to human IgE, leading to mast cell degranulation. Furthermore, they speculated that the development of IgG or IgM after the first dose of vaccine, which neutralizes the superantigens before they interact with IgE, could explain the lack of reaction to the booster vaccination.This possible role of variable triggers in determining reactions to vaccines in cases of mastocytosis is not deeply analyzed in the literature. Additionally, when a specific trigger was identified, its role in the underlying mechanisms of reactions and cofactors could not be explained. For that reason, in the future, it will be of great interest to analyze the role of possible cofactors in cases of reactions to vaccines in patients with mastocytosis.Parente et al., in their study of the evaluation of vaccination safety in 72 pediatric patients with mastocytosis, concluded that vaccine reactions in mastocytosis are usually mild and do not generally occur with boosters (as confirmed by Hussain et al.) (Table 2) (6, 9). After the first dose of the hexavalent vaccine, four patients presented cutaneous reactions. All four of the children who presented a vaccine-related reaction received the subsequent vaccinations and boosters in a monitored hospital setting. Among them, the two patients who presented a previous bullous reaction assumed oral antihistamines beginning 48 hours before vaccine administration. Moreover, the patient affected by DCM was on a continuous antihistamine treatment. None of the four children presented a further reaction to the subsequent two boosters of hexavalent or the other mandatory vaccines, which may demonstrate a potential role for antihistaminic treatment in preventing further reaction. Hence, Parente et al., propose to limit a prolonged observing time to 2 hours, only in case of administration of the first dose of vaccine (6). In our experience, considering the significant reaction that occurred on the booster dose of a previous vaccine and in contrast to scientific literature that defines how adverse events usually occur with the first dose of vaccine, we found it difficult to stigmatize reaction to vaccination in mastocytosis, and so we decided to extend the 2-hours observation time for all the vaccines administered (6). Parents should be trained to identify the warning signs of an early adverse reaction and taught how to use an epinephrine autoinjector when necessary (12, 22). In the analyzed study by Parente et al., hexavalent vaccines (and therefore, polyvalent formulation) seem to be associated with a higher risk of reaction (6). Nevertheless, there is no significant overwhelming scientific evidence in the literature to suggest avoiding polyvalent formulation. Taking into account ministerial Italian recommendations (24) and other sources of information (16, 22), would suggest avoiding the co-administration of multiple vaccines (22) and not the use of polyvalent vaccines, also for practical reasons, including the maximization of the adherence to scheduled vaccinations. We decided to administer varicella vaccine in a single injection, instead of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine polyvalent formulation, only for the wish of patient’s family, that was still frightened and distrustful of vaccines. It is indeed very important that families regain their trust in vaccinations, especially among these kinds of patients and in the anti-vaccination movement era (25).A recent retrospective study of 35 patients evaluated vaccination reactions in pediatric patients with MPCM (Table 2) (23). The study’s conclusions are similar to previous ones and highlight that vaccination reactions in mastocytosis tend to be mild, so scheduled vaccinations should be continued (23).Bankova et al., highlight the importance of precautions with procedures and adequate premedication to reduce the risk of severe complications. The authors describe a case of generalized bullous cutaneous reaction in a 5-month-old boy affected by DCM after the scheduled 4-month vaccinations (Table 2). In this case, the patient was treated with a low-dose oral steroid for 5 days, which was indicated by the authors as the preferred therapy for cases with blister formation according to indications reported in the literature. Subsequently, the patient presented two additional episodes of blistering associated with vaccination and viral illness but, these episodes became milder, thanks to the initiation of a regimen of oral and topical sodium cromolyn (16).ConclusionThe lack of specific guidelines to follow in case of vaccination reaction in cutaneous mastocytosis represents a significant issue to face. The lack of predictive elements of the risk of reaction makes it impossible to define its level for future vaccinations, even if the literature states that these patients frequently tolerate future vaccine doses. Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus on which therapy is most appropriate. In addition, there are no criteria to define a stratification of risk that allows us to identify who is the most deserving patient to receive it. It would be very important to collect extensive multicentric data with the aim to compare different schemes of premedication to establish the most efficient protocol in the most suitable patient, but this is made difficult by the rarity of pathology.In this case report, we are far from establishing the best therapeutic strategy to adopt, but we took into account and shared information collected from the literature to define a non-standardized pharmacological and procedural protocol, which we adopted in our experience. Thus, a background therapy with ketotifen associated with a premedication protocol made by two doses of oxatomide and a single dose of betamethasone was helpful to make possible the execution of the other vaccines. Though, as previously underlined, since the incidence of future reactions appears unpredictable, the child might have tolerated the subsequent vaccination without premedication, but we did not consider this a deterrent to not perform a premedication therapy considering the significant role of premedication described in literature in these patients to prevent and control adverse events and the patient’s family fear to execute the other mandatory vaccinations, especially so shortly after a relevant reaction. It is indeed important to highlight as well the significant role played by the premedication therapy to make the patient’s family trust vaccinations again, considering that the patient subsequently did not present in the two vaccinations executed in our center any kind of clinical manifestations.The choice to use betamethasone in our premedication protocol can be justified by the long-time latency between vaccine injection and clinical manifestations, so to control any delayed reactions. We avoided all the possible stimuli of reaction, and we adopted specific measures of care, as explained in literature (16, 21, 22). Finally, we suggest how in these children, it could be considered the idea of taking precaution when vaccination is planned, regardless of the kind of vaccine and if a dose of the same vaccine was previously received. However, international consensus needs to be reached to manage vaccinations in children with mastocytosis and previous adverse reactions to vaccines.Data Availability StatementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.

Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementThe annual flu shot reduces the risk of stroke, sepsis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in Covid patients. (Representative Image)India Today Web DeskWashington,UPDATED: Jul 12, 2021 15:56 ISTA new study has revealed that people who are vaccinated against Influenza are less likely to need critical emergency care and the flu jab may reduce severe effects of Covid-19. An analysis of 75,000 Covid-19 patients from around the world found that the annual flu shot reduces the risk of stroke, sepsis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in Covid patients. advertisementAccording to researchers, Covid patients who had been vaccinated against the flu were also found to be less likely to be hospitalised and admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).READ: Nasal Covid vaccine prevents disease, transmission in animals, finds study"This finding is particularly significant because the pandemic is straining resources in many parts of the world," said Devinder Singh, a professor at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine in the US."Therefore, our research -- if validated by prospective randomised clinical trials -- has the potential to reduce the worldwide burden of disease," Singh, the study's senior author, added.Previous studies have suggested that the flu vaccine may provide protection against Covid-19, which means it could be a valuable weapon in the fight against the pandemic.The study, which is the largest of its kind, screened de-identified electronic health records held on the TriNeX research database of more than 70 million patients to identify two groups of 37,377 patients.The two groups were matched for factors that could affect their risk of severe Covid-19, including age, gender, ethnicity, smoking and health problems such as diabetes, obesity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.While the members of the first group received the flu vaccine between two weeks and six months before being diagnosed with Covid-19, the second group also had contracted the virus but were not vaccinated against flu.Patients from countries including the US, UK, Germany, Italy, Israel and Singapore were used to conduct the study.ALSO READ: Covid-19: Risk of severe illness, death in children very low, UK study findsThe research was presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID), held online.The incidence of 15 adverse outcomes, including sepsis, strokes, DVT, and acute respiratory failure, within 120 days of testing positive for Covid-19 was then compared between the two groups.The analysis found those who had not had the flu jab were significantly more likely, (up to 20 percent) to have been admitted to ICU.They were also up to 58 per cent more likely to visit the Emergency Department, up to 45 per cent more likely to develop sepsis, up to 58 per cent more likely to have a stroke, and up to 40 per cent more likely to have DVT."The risk of death was not reduced," the researchers said.However, it is not yet fully understood how the influenza vaccine provides protection against Covid-19. "Most theories centre around the influenza vaccine boosting the innate immune system -- general defences we are born with that are not tailored to any particular illness," they said.The study authors concluded that their results strongly showed the flu vaccine protects against several severe effects of Covid-19.They noted that more research is needed to prove and better understand the possible link but, in the future, the flu shot could be used to help provide increased protection in countries where the Covid-19 vaccine is in short supply."Influenza vaccination may even benefit individuals hesitant to receive a Covid-19 vaccine due to the newness of the technology,” said Susan Taghioff, of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.She further added that despite all this, the influenza vaccine is by no means a replacement for the Covid-19 vaccine and the researchers advocated for everyone to receive their Covid vaccine if possible.

Here are certain things parents should know getting their children vaccinated against influenza. Flu shot gives children protection against influenza or flu virus Written by Editorial Team |Updated : July 15, 2021 10:26 AM IST Influenza is also known as flu, and this mainly impacts the respiratory tract. The intensity of the flu or influenza is much more than a common cold. Doctors all over, highly recommend parents get their children vaccinated each year against influenza. One needs to get this vaccine each year because influenza changes and modifies itself every year. It can be called the seasonal flu, but it can cause a lot of harm if one is not protected against it. After studying and anticipating how the flu will transform itself, each year doctorsesearchers take out a new vaccine around the month of August or September, so that people do not catch the flu or influenza. Getting the flu shot means protecting ourselves and the people around us. It is important for children below 12 years to get vaccinated, however, there are some pros and cons to it. Here, Dr Lini Balakrishnan, Consultant Paediatrician, Motherhood Hospitals, Sarjapur, Bangalore, tells us all about flu/influenza vaccine. Is the flu/influenza vaccine safe?The flu vaccine is safe. The doctors and researchers put a lot of study into developing a new vaccine every season. A few groups of people you might want to avoid the vaccine are: Children with Guillain-Barre syndromeChildren under 6 months of ageChildren who have an allergy to egg allergyPros of getting the flu or influenza vaccineIt gives children protection against influenza or flu virus. This is the main and obvious benefit of getting a flu shot. If your child gets influenza or flu vaccine, he or she will be protected against the flu.

If by chance, your child contracts the influenza virus and he or she is vaccinated against it, the vaccine may help to lessen the impact of the virus. It may even help reduce the risk of any other kind of complications due to the virus. It may help achieve a herd immunity. If sufficient or enough people get vaccinated against the flu, then the people who might not be able to afford the vaccine and children under 6 months can be protected against influenza without being vaccinated. It is an indirect kind of protection provided through the community. Administering flu vaccine to children can help reduce pressure on hospitals. Taking the example right in front of us, where people are suffering and dying from COVID-19, getting vaccinated against influenza can help reduce the pressure on the hospitals and medical system amidst a crisis. You may like to read Cons of getting the flu or influenza vaccineAllergic reaction: There is a chance that children might get severe allergic reactions to the contents of the vaccine for influenza/ flu shot. Symptoms of an allergic reaction may include- wheezing, difficulty in breath, rashes, swelling or redness around the mouth and eyes, dizziness, or weakness. May trigger Guillain-Barre syndrome: This is an extremely rare condition in kids, the nervous system starts attacking the peripheral nerves. It is not very common; however, influenza or flu shot may trigger this condition. One must always consult with their general practitioner before getting the shot. May even get the flu: Even after getting the vaccine, one might end up getting influenza or flu. May get a sore arm: Due to the flu or influenza shot, some children may experience extreme pain in the arm for which they got the vaccine. It can be excruciating pain where they might even be able to move their arm and even a small move might hurt them. But there is nothing to worry about, it will resolve itself. TRENDING NOW Note: It is important for children to get vaccinated against flu. But before getting the influenza vaccine, one should always consult with their doctors or pediatricians to double-check for any allergic reactions.

Annual Survey Highlights Hot Topics for Facility Cleaning Managers News & Views 7/13/2021 Health Experts Fear Bounce-Back Flu Season Sponsors An unintended silver lining from the COVID-19 pandemic last year was a mild flu season — due largely to the dramatic decrease in social gatherings and general social distancing among the public. The lack of potential exposure, however, has health experts concerned about a rampant bounce-back in cases for the upcoming 2021-2022 flu season, CNBC reports. The eventual severity of the upcoming influenza season hangs on several factors, including people’s willingness to maintain personal hygiene habits, virus evolution and natural immunity buildup, notes Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas COVID-19 Modeling Consortium. The hope is people have gained more acceptance overall to vaccinations and continue to embrace infection control practices in the case that the season does indeed turn into a severe one.While predictions for the upcoming season are difficult, the CDC anticipates numbers closer to pre-pandemic levels as social distancing restrictions continue to be relaxed or lifted entirely. Lynette Brammer, team lead of the CDC’s Domestic Influenza Surveillance Team says the outlier of last year’s low cases means that immunity among adults will be contingent on exposure to the influenza virus from 2 years ago or later. Brammer notes positive case rates for the flu hovered between 26 and 30 percent from 2016-2019 prior to dropping to below 0.5 percent for the entirety of typical flu season in 2020. Regardless of how the upcoming season turns out, Brammer encourages public vaccination and to be especially mindful of younger children who have lower immunity to the influenza virus than adults. These tips for keeping facilities clean and safe from the flu apply to any year or severity.

(IANS)The annual flu shot may reduce the risk of stroke, sepsis and blood clots in patients with COVID-19, according to large international research. The findings showed it could be a valuable weapon in the fight to halt the pandemic.Researchers from the University of Miami in Florida, US, found that patients with COVID-19 who had been vaccinated against flu were also less likely to visit the emergency department and be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).On the other hand, those who had not had the flu jab were significantly more likely (up to 20 per cent more likely) to have been admitted to ICU; to visit the Emergency Department (up to 58 per cent more likely), to develop sepsis (up to 45 per cent more likely), to have a stroke (up to 58 per cent more likely) and a DVT (up to 40 per cent more likely). The risk of death was not reduced.It isn't known exactly how the flu jab provides protection against COVID-19 but most theories centre around it boosting the innate immune system—"general" defences we are born with that are not tailored to any particular illness, said the researchers.The study shows that flu shots could be used to help provide increased protection in countries where the COVID-19 vaccine is in short supply, however it is not a substitute for COVID-19 vaccinations, they added."Influenza vaccination may even benefit individuals hesitant to receive a COVID-19 vaccine due to the newness of the technology," added Susan Taghioff, from the University's Miller School of Medicine.Advertisement"Despite this, the influenza vaccine is by no means a replacement for the vaccine and we advocate for everyone to receive their COVID-19 vaccine if able to," she noted.For the study, the team screened de-identified electronic health records of more than 70 million patients to identify two groups of 37,377 patients from countries including the US, UK, Germany, Italy, Israel and Singapore.Members of the first group had received the flu vaccine between two weeks and six months before being diagnosed with COVID-19. Those in the second group also had COVID-19 but were not vaccinated against flu.The study was presented at the ongoing European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) taking place online between July 9 and 12.**The above article has been published from a wire source with minimal modifications to the headline and text The Weather Company’s primary journalistic mission is to report on breaking weather news, the environment and the importance of science to our lives.AdvertisementTop VideoVideoWATCH: Latest India's Weekend Weather Forecast: November 9-10VideoWATCH: When Hunting In Groups, Marlins Change Colours to Coordinate Attacks!VideoWHO Reports Nearly 10,000 COVID-19 Deaths Worldwide and 42% Surge in Hospital AdmissionsVideoArctic Report Card Highlights Unprecedented Warmth, Melting, and Declining Sea IceRead MoreAdvertisementAdvertisementThe Weather ChannelWeather UndergroundFeedbackWeather APINews RoomTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyAccessibility StatementData VendorsGeorgiaeSSENTIAL AccessibilityWe recognise our responsibility to use data and technology for good.

It displays broad-spectrum virucidal activity in the presence of UV light and has been shown to be effective in inactivating various viruses in blood products prior to transfusions. In addition, its use has been validated for methemoglobinemia and malaria treatment. In this study, we first evaluated the virucidal activity of methylene blue against influenza virus H1N1 upon different incubation times and in the presence or absence of light activation, and then against SARS-CoV-2. We further assessed the therapeutic activity of methylene blue by administering it to cells previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we examined the effect of co-administration of the drug together with immune serum. Our findings reveal that methylene blue displays virucidal preventive or therapeutic activity against influenza virus H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations and in the absence of UV-activation. We also confirm that MB antiviral activity is based on several mechanisms of action as the extent of genomic RNA degradation is higher in presence of light and after long exposure. Our work supports the interest of testing methylene blue in clinical studies to confirm a preventive and/or therapeutic efficacy against both influenza virus H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Influenza A viruses and coronaviruses are among the major human threats due to the presence of an important animal reservoir and the ability of both viruses to cross the species barrier via mutation and reassortment or recombination. The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) pandemic unveiled the inability to develop specific antivirals and vaccines in a sufficiently short time frame. Although a limited circulation of influenza virus in the 2020–2021 season was achieved through social distancing and lock-down measures, in the coming years co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza might contribute to the severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia1. Moreover, neuraminidase treatment has been shown to increase the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for its receptor, ACE-2, and this might increase the susceptibility of influenza infected patients to SARS-CoV-2 superinfection2. This scenario highlights the urgent clinical need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs ready to use during pandemics and epidemics.Methylene Blue (MB) is an FDA and EMA approved drug with an excellent safety profile. Due to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antitoxic effects, photoactivated MB is used for a wide range of applications including treatment of methemoglobinemia or malaria3. Photoactivated MB is also widely used to obtain blood product preparations free of viruses such as HIV4, Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS)5, or SARS-CoV-2 virus6. The antiviral activity appears to rely on multiple mechanisms, and is more potent for enveloped viruses7. Among other actions, MB is known to corrupt viral DNA or RNA integrity. This is due to a redox reaction in which the molecule accepts electrons on its aromatic thiazine ring, thus being reduced to leuko-methylene blue (MBH2) which in turn transfers electrons to other molecules such as nucleic acids. Moreover, MB in combination with oxygen and a source of energy results in the production of singlet oxygen, a highly reactive reaction partner which induces guanine oxidation [8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua) lesions] damaging DNA or RNA. Other mechanisms include but are not limited to (a) modified carbonyl moieties on proteins, (b) single-strand breaks in the RNA genome and (c) RNA–protein crosslinks, all lesions correlating well with a broad-spectrum virucidal activity8. In addition to nucleic acid damaging activity, MB was shown to inactivate viruses such as HIV by targeting also the viral envelope and core proteins9.MB presents few side effects at doses below 5 mg/kg. Long term, high dose administrations such as for malaria treatment, may result in temporary fully reversible blueish coloration of urine, sclera and skin. Sensitivity to thiazine dyes and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are contraindications10.Using a classical virus inhibition assay for both H1N1 influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, we present in vitro data demonstrating a potent antiviral activity of MB with and without UV-activation. We report a strong antiviral activity without light (experiments performed in a closed stainless-steel box) at 2, 4 and 20 h of incubation with the virus. Interestingly, degradation of genomic RNA was mostly observed in presence of light and upon long exposure, confirming that the antiviral effect relies on multiple mechanisms of action and can be efficient also in absence of extensive RNA degradation. Additional experiments carried on with SARS-CoV-2 further highlight that MB is effective also when added on cells already infected. Finally, we demonstrate an additive effect of MB when co-administered with immune sera. Altogether these data open the possibility to evaluate MB as a potential therapeutic agent against influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 in clinical studies.ResultsIn order to define a non-toxic dose range of MB, we calculated the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) in our in vitro infection systems, MDCK for H1N1 and Vero-E6 cells for SARS-CoV-2. We assessed MB toxicity in infection medium and upon different times of administration, according to the experimental conditions chosen to test the antiviral activity of the compound (Table1).Table 1 Assessment of MB toxicity.Full size tableWe first asked whether MB was able to exert antiviral activity independently of visible light. We thus incubated different doses of the compound spanning from 2 μg/ml to 0.08 μg/ml, with 1.5 × 107 plaque forming units (pfu) of human A/Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1), for 2 h or 20 h at room temperature and in the presence or absence of visible light. We then measured the number of infectious particles in each condition. MB exerted virucidal activity in the presence and absence of light and at both incubation times, suggesting that the compound can irreversibly inactivate a relevant enveloped respiratory virus independently of visible light (Fig. 1a,b). As more than one mechanism of action can underlie the antiviral properties of MB6, we asked whether the compound would damage the H1N1 genome. We measured genome integrity by RT-qPCR in each of the above-described conditions (Fig. 1c,d). Surprisingly, the reduction of H1N1 infectiousness induced by MB did not always result in a reduction of viral genome quantified by RT-qPCR. Only upon 20 h incubation under the light and at the highest doses, MB induced a significant decrease in viral RNA, compared to the untreated control (Fig. 1d). However, as the RT-qPCR amplicon is only ~ 105 bp, it could remain intact while longer genomic fragments may be affected by the treatment. We therefore investigated the integrity of H1N1 segments by conventional PCR, targeting the entire NP and M genes, which are 1.5 and 0.9 Kb long respectively (Fig. 1e,f). As expected, the highest tested dose of MB (2 µg/ml), caused significant degradation of these two viral segments after 20 h incubation in the light. Interestingly, partial degradation was also observed upon 20 h incubation in the darkness and upon 2 h incubation under the light, while no degradation was observed after 2 h incubation in the dark (Fig. 1e,f). These findings suggest that RNA damage caused by MB6,7 does not fully account for its antiviral activity. Overall these preliminary results prompted us to evaluate the virucidal activity of MB against SARS-CoV-2.Figure 1Assessment of MB antiviral activity on human H1N1. MB was incubated with H1N1 virus A/Netherlands/602/2009 (1.5 × 107 pfu) for 2 h or 20 h in the darkness (a, c) or in the presence of light (b, d). At the end of the incubation, mixtures were serially diluted and added for 1 h at 37 °C on MDCK cells (a) and (b). Mixtures were then removed and the cells were overlaid with medium containing 0.8% agarose and TPCK trypsin 1 µg/ml. At 48 h post infection (hpi) the cells were fixed in order to count the plaques and determine the viral titer in each experimental condition. In parallel, viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR (c, d) and viral genome integrity was assessed by PCR amplification of the NP (e) and M (f) viral segments. In (e) and (f) only the “UT” and “MB 2 µg/ml” conditions were examined. Results are mean and SD of two independent experiments. 2 µg/ml (6.25 µM), 0.4 µg/ml (1.25 µM), 0.08 µg/ml (0.25 µM). UT = untreated. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.Full size imageHence, we incubated different doses of the drug, ranging between 50 μg/ml and 0.08 μg/ml, with 5 × 106 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 for 20 h in the dark and at room temperature. The results shown in Fig. 2 evidence a complete inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication from 50 to 10 µg/ml and a 3.05 log reduction at 0.08 µg/ml, the lowest dose tested (Fig. 2a). Of note Jin et al.6 observed no virucidal activity of MB against SARS-CoV-2 when administered for 40 min in the dark. We thus performed additional experiments incubating MB and the virus for 2 h or 4 h and evidenced a statistically significant effect at the 2 h incubation time (Fig. 2b). This effect was however lower compared to that observed at 20 h incubation (5.3 log reduction after 2 h treatment with 20 µg/ml and 3.6 log with 2 µg/ml).Figure 2Assessment of MB antiviral activity on SARS-CoV-2. MB was incubated with SARS-CoV-2 (5 × 106 pfu) for 20 h (a,c) or 2 h and 4 h (b, d) in the darkness, in (c) MB was incubated in combination with human convalescent serum (diluted 1:80). At the end of the incubation, mixtures were serially diluted and added for 1 h at 37 °C on Vero-E6 cells. Mixtures were then removed and cells were overlaid with medium containing 0.8% avicel. Cells were fixed 48 hpi and plaques were counted in order to determine the viral titer in presence or absence of MB. In parallel, viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR (d). Results are mean and SD of three independent experiments. 50 µg/ml (156 µM), 10 µg/ml (31.2 µM), 2 µg/ml (6.25 µM), 0.4 µg/ml (1.25 µM), 0.08 µg/ml (0.25 µM). UT = untreated. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 ***p < 0.001 ****p < 0.0001.Full size imageSubsequently we evaluated the possible combinatorial activity of MB and immunoglobulins present in the serum of a convalescent individual. Preliminary tests were conducted to identify the optimal serum dilution able to neutralize the virus and evidenced a 4.15 log decrease in presence of 1:16 dilution, a 2.3 log decrease in presence of 1:80 dilution, and absence of neutralization at lower serum dilutions. In order to be able to evaluate any additive effect, the serum was diluted 1:80 for further experiments. 5 × 106 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 were incubated for 20 h in the dark with three different doses of MB in presence or absence of diluted convalescent serum. The results (Fig. 2c) evidence a partial additive effect of MB and convalescent sera, with a complete inhibition of viral infectivity when combining MB (up to 0.4 µg/ml) and serum. To rule out the possibility that serum factors other than anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could enhance the action of MB, we also tested MB in combination with a non-immune control serum, which showed no anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity alone nor potentiation of MB effect (Supplementary Fig. S1). To further verify the mechanism of action of MB in the dark against SARS-CoV-2, we performed RT-qPCR on the samples incubated for 2 h and 4 h. Despite the logarithmic decrease in viral infectivity (Fig. 2b), no decrease of viral RNA was evidenced by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2d).Finally, we assessed the efficacy of MB for therapeutic use. We thus tested whether MB was able to reduce the viral yield in cells previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. The treatment was administered at 4 or 24 hpi and the virus released by the infected cells was measured titrating the culture supernatants at 48 hpi. In both conditions we observed viral inhibition in a dose–response manner (Fig. 3) with an EC50 of 0.11 μg/ml at 4 hpi and of 0.13 μg/ml at 24 hpi.Figure 3Viral yield reduction assay. Vero-E6 were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.005). 4 h or 24 hpi, medium containing or not serial dilutions of MB was added on cells. 24 h later, cell supernatants were collected and titrated on Vero-E6 cells as described in Fig. 2. Results are mean and SD of two independent experiments performed in duplicate. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.Full size imageDiscussionHere we show broad-spectrum virucidal activity of MB in absence of light activation, against both H1N1 influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 after incubation times of 2, 4 or 20 h. In previous studies6, no antiviral activity was observed after shorter incubations (40 min) in absence of light. However, in these works, the evaluation of viral titer was done with qPCR and not by measuring infectivity. The activity of the compound in absence of UV-activation is thus suggestive of a different mechanism of action than that reported in presence of UV light or slower kinetics. This hypothesis is further sustained by the lack of H1N1 NP or M RNA decrease and the detection of both H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR after a 2 h incubation with MB in the darkness (Figs. 1d and 2d), which is in line with previous reports. We highlight that the antiviral activity of MB is enhanced in combination with convalescent serum, and that such effect is specifically due to the presence of immunoglobulins against Sars-Cov-2. This suggests that the compound could not only be effective in infected patients, but also that its efficacy could be further increased by immune serum.A limitation of our study with SARS-CoV-2 is that the experiments are performed in Vero-E6 cell line where other drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine11, were reported to exert antiviral activity, however without showing efficacy in clinical trials12. Nevertheless, in those cases the drug interfered with viral replication inside the cell, while MB acts also on extracellular viral particles. Therefore, we do not expect to observe such a discrepancy when going into clinical trials.A recent French publication on a cohort of 2500 end stage cancer patients treated with MB during the first wave of CoviD-19 mentions a possible protective role of MB against respiratory viruses, as in this cohort there were no reported cases of influenza or SARS-CoV-2 infections13. Another report describes a possible complementary effect of MB in vitro on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike–ACE2 protein–protein interaction14. The proposed mechanism of action is mediated by the binding of MB on the cells and not on the virus. The experiments were performed in a different experimental setting than ours, by pre-treating the cells with MB and subsequently infecting them with SARS-CoV-2. Lastly, an additional study compared in vitro the median Effective Concentration (EC50) of 3 drugs against SARS-COV-2, when administered 4 h before infection. MB was the most efficient antiviral drug with an EC50 of 0.30 ± 0.03 µM15. This study did not focus on the activity in absence or presence of light, nor in measuring the viral inactivation. The drug was added 4 h before infection and left on cells for the entire experiment, and the infectivity was evaluated through RT-qPCR. The EC50 determined was however in line with our experiments in which we added MB after infection (Fig. 3), validating our results.In view of the wide variety of singlet oxygen driven chemical reactions corroding nucleic acids and proteins, one is surprised by the well documented absence of severe side effects of MB, even at doses up to 5 mg/kg. This may be linked to the fact, that the body’s immune system uses MB for its own purposes. It is known that antibodies have, close to their binding site, a catalytic site capable of producing singlet oxygen in the presence of water16. Riboflavin, also known as Vitamin B2 is another efficient singlet oxygen producing compound17. It seems reasonable to assume that mammals have developed so far unknown control mechanisms to keep singlet oxygen collateral damages at bay.Altogether, our results support the interest of testing MB in clinical studies to confirm a preventive or therapeutic efficacy, alone or combined with immune sera, against two major public health concerns: influenza virus and SARS-CoV-21.Further experiments will be required to fully understand the different antiviral mechanisms of action of MB against these two enveloped viruses. Based on previously published data, MB might inactivate viruses limiting viral replication and spread beyond the upper respiratory tract. In addition, its anti-inflammatory activity3 may lower the side effects linked to the host response.Materials and methodsCompound and convalescent serumMethylene blue (Methylthonium chloride solution) was purchased from ProVepharm. A convalescent or a control serum, respectively tested positive or negatve for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 by ELISA, were isolated from blood collected in serum separator tubes. Within 1 h from collection, sera were isolated by centrifuging the blood at 2500 RPM for 15 min. The sera were aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C.Cells and virusMDCK and (ATCC CCL34) cells and Vero C1008 (clone E6) (ATCC CRL-1586) cells (kindly provided by Prof Gary Kobinger from the University of Laval), were propagated in DMEM High Glucose + Glutamax supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptavidin (pen/strep).SARS-CoV-2/Switzerland/GE9586/2020 was isolated from a clinical specimen in the University Hospital of Geneva in Vero-E6. Cells were infected and supernatant was collected 3 days post infection, clarified, aliquoted and frozen at − 80 °C before titration by plaque assay in Vero-E6.Human H1N1 virus A/Netherlands/602/2009, clade 1A.3.3.2, [Fludb entry CY148018]18 was a gift from Prof. Mirco Schmolke (University of Geneva) and was cultivated and titrated in MDCK cells by plaque assay.Toxicity assayVero-E6 and MDCK cells (13,000 and 20,000 cells per well respectively) were seeded in 96-well plate one day before the assay. For toxicity evaluation in Vero-E6 methylene blue was serially diluted 1:2 in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and added on cells for 1 h, followed by a washout and the addition of DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS for additional 48 h hours. Alternatively, the dose range of MB was added on the cells for 48 h. The toxicity evaluation in MDCK cells was performed in serum free DMEM supplemented with 0.2 µg/ml of TPCK-Trypsin (Sigma), using the same MB dose-range and times of treatment applied to Vero-E6. MTS reagent (Promega) was added on cells for 3 h at 37 °C according to manufacturer instructions, subsequently absorbance read at 570 nm. Percentages of viability were calculated by comparing the absorbance in treated and untreated wells. 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) were calculated with Prism 8 (GraphPad).Plaque assayVero-E6, 100000 cells per well, were seeded in 24-well plate one day before the assay. Serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 were added on cells in a final volume of 200 µl for 1 h at 37 °C. After infection Vero-E6 cells were washed and overlaid with 0.8% Avicel rc581 in medium supplemented with 5% FBS.MDCK cells 500000 cells per well, were seeded in 6-well plate 24 h in advance. Serial dilutions were added on cells in a final volume of 500 µl for 1 h at 37 °C. MDCK monolayers were then washed and overlaid with 0.8% agarose in medium supplemented with TPCK trypsin 1 µg/ml.Two days after infection, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% and stained with crystal violet solution containing ethanol.Plaques were counted.Inhibition assayH1N1 (1.5 × 107 pfu) or SARS-CoV-2 (5 × 106 pfu) were incubated at room temperature in the dark (in an opaque stainless-steel box) or under visible light, in a final volume of 100 µl, with different dilutions of MB for 2 h or 20 h. The infection mixtures were then serially diluted (1:10 factor) and added for 1 h at 37 °C on the respective host cell lines. The residual infectivity was evaluated by plaque assay as described in the previous paragraph. The residual infectivity of the different conditions was calculated. Statistical analysis was done with Prism software (GraphPad) comparing the different conditions.Neutralization assaySARS-CoV-2 (5 × 106 pfu) was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20 h in a final volume of 400 µl, with different dilutions of immune serum. The infection mixtures were then serially diluted (1:10 factor) and added for 1 h at 37 °C on the respective host cell lines and subjected to plaque assay as described in the paragraph above. The same experiments were conducted in presence of immune serum and non immune serum at dilution 1:80 in presence or absence of different concentrations of MB.RT-qPCR analysisH1N1 (1.5 × 107 pfu) was incubated at room temperature in the dark (in an opaque stainless steel box) or under visible light, in a final volume of 100 µl, with different dilutions of MB for 2 h or 20 h. SARS-CoV-2 (5 × 106 pfu) was incubated in the dark with 2 or 20 μg/ml of MB for 2 or 4 h. Viral RNA was extracted with EZNA viral extraction kit (Omega Biotek) and quantified by using RT-qPCR (Table 2) with the QuantiTect kit (Qiagen) in a StepOne ABI Thermocycler.Table 2 Primers and probes used for RT-qPCR analysis of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and SARS-CoV-2.Full size tablePCR analysisViral RNAs were isolated from H1N1 (1.5 × 107 pfu) incubated at room temperature in the dark (in an opaque stainless-steel box) or under visible light, in a final volume of 100 µl, with MB (2 µg/ml) for 2 h or 20 h. Samples were then reverse transcribed. The RT reaction was performed with a mix composed of First Strand Buffer 5x (Invitrogen), H2O Rnase free, Superscript ® III RT/Platinum ® Taq Mix (Invitrogen), 0.1 M DTT (Invitrogen), dNTPs (25 mM), Protector RNase inhibitor (40U/ul) (Roche) and Random hexamers (50ug/ul) (Invitrogen).Viral gene segments were then amplified from the viral cDNA using a master mix composed of 10X PCR Rxn buffer (-MgCl2) (Invitrogen), 50 mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen), H2O Rnase free, Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (5U/ul) (Invitrogen), dNTPs (10 mM) and M13-tailed primers specific for the M and NP H1N1segments (Table 3). The length and the quality of the amplified fragments were verified by electrophoresis in an agarose gel 1% with 4 ul of Sybr-safe.Table 3 Primers used to amplify gene segments of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.Full size tableViral yield reduction assayVero-E6 cells (100,000 cells per well) were seeded in 24-well plate. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI, 0.005 pfu/cell) for 4 h at 37 °C. The monolayers were then washed and overlaid with medium supplemented with 5% FBS containing serial dilutions of compound, alternatively the compound was added 24 hpi. Supernatants were harvested 48 hpi and titrated on Vero-E6 cells.Statistical analysisWhere possible, half-maximal antiviral effective concentration (EC50) values were calculated by regression analysis using the dose–response curves generated from the experimental data using Prism software (GraphPad). The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) was determined using logarithmic viability curves. Two-way or one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnet’s multiple comparison test, was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences between treated and untreated samples. Significance was set at the 95% level.Ethical authorizationWritten informed consent was obtained from the subjects involved and the research protocol was approved by the local ethics committee (commission cantonale d’éthique de la recherche CCER de Genève) and performed in accordance with relevant regulations and with the Declaration of Helsinki.

The patients in the two groups were closely matched for age, sex, ethnicity, health problems including diabetes and lung disease, and lifestyle factors such as diet and whether or not they smoked.The scientists analysed how often the patients suffered any of 15 potentially serious health effects ranging from blood clots and heart attacks to kidney and respiratory failure in the four months following their Covid diagnosis.‘Their childhood has been stolen’: calls for action to tackle long Covid Read moreThe findings, presented at an online meeting of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, suggest the flu vaccine may protect against some medical problems caused by Covid. According to the study, Covid patients who were not vaccinated against the flu were 45% to 58% more likely to have a stroke, about 40% more likely to develop DVT, and 36% to 45% more likely to have sepsis. They were also more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit and to have more frequent visits to hospital emergency departments.“It could be that the flu vaccine stimulates the immune system non-specifically and has that benefit, but you always wonder whether these associations are causal, or whether there’s a common factor, like social deprivation which might explain why they go hand in hand,” said Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag). “People who manage to get a flu vaccine may have better health in other ways.”“The best way to protect yourself from Covid is to get a Covid vaccine,” he added.Following interim advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the NHS is preparing to offer Covid booster shots alongside annual flu vaccinations from September. Ministers are particularly concerned that influenza, which was almost nonexistent last season, will bounce back dangerously in the winter ahead, just as Covid cases are peaking again.“One of the big risks that I and others were worried about is in a bad flu season, you could see 20,000 people dying,” the vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told The Andrew Marr Show on the BBC.Explore more on these topicsMedical researchCoronavirusVaccines and immunisationHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUS elections 2024UKClimate crisisUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But as people interact more they’re likely to spread and could hit children especially hard.Social SharingAs children emerge from their homes after COVID-19-related lockdowns, common viruses that all but disappeared during the pandemic are re-emerging too, doctors say."This time of year in pediatric hospitals, it's usually quiet," said Dr. Fatima Kakkar, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at CHU Sainte-Justine in Montreal. "But now we're seeing a surge of respiratory infections."The level of non-COVID illnesses is what Kakkar usually sees in the fall, she said, when children are out and about in daycares or schools.While the public health measures taken in the last year — including physical distancing, masking and staying home  — were used to stop the spread of COVID-19, they also had the side benefit of preventing other respiratory viruses, including colds, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus, which causes croup.But experts say that also means because children haven't come in contact with those viruses for a long time, they haven't built up the antibodies they normally would — and they won't have the immunity they might otherwise have."What's happened to us is we … had no exposure," said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist and microbiologist at Sinai Health in Toronto."Now that we're getting back to normal and kids can see each other, we're starting to see those infections [again] in children."Now that kids are emerging from isolation, they're being exposed to common viruses their immune systems haven't encountered for more than a year, experts say. (Syda Productions/Shutterstock)Kids will usually recover from most of these illnesses on their own, but Kakkar said pediatricians are especially worried about a rise in RSV. Although it's a common virus, it can cause breathing problems in infants and toddlers that are so severe they require hospital care, she said.Last month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory notifying health-care providers that RSV cases were on the rise in parts of the country, and asking them to test children with acute respiratory symptoms for RSV if COVID-19 was ruled out.According to the CDC, RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children under one.Flu still to comeOne respiratory virus that doctors aren't seeing yet is the flu, Kakkar said.But after a year with essentially no flu season, largely due to COVID-19 precautions, influenza is expected to return this fall.Should Ontario make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory for school?Why is there no flu amid so many COVID cases? Your COVID-19 questions answeredEven though our immune systems may not be ready for the flu this year, there's good news, doctors say."People are worried about the flu coming back. But for the flu, we have a safe and effective vaccine," said Dr. Ellen Foxman, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn."This is a great year to get your flu shot if you haven't done it before," said Foxman, noting that she gets her three children vaccinated every year.Although children are getting more respiratory infections, doctors say parents shouldn't be alarmed."This is not a big deal for most children," McGeer said.Pediatric infectious diseases specialist Dr. Fatima Kakkar says there's a 'surge' of respiratory infections that her hospital wouldn't normally see until the fall. (Submitted by Fatima Kakkar )Plus, she said, parents can use several of the same precautions they've learned during the COVID-19 pandemic to help prevent the spread of re-emerging childhood viruses."Wash your hands," McGeer said. "We know that simple things reduce your risk of respiratory viral infections.""[There's] good evidence that washing your hands five times a day reduces the risk by about 30 per cent, give or take."Staying home when you're sick and keeping your child at home if they have symptoms is also a behaviour adopted during COVID-19 that needs to continue, Kakkar said.Plus, parents should be prepared now to deal with viruses they wouldn't normally expect until the fall."Pretend it's October," she said.With files from Christine Birak and Melanie GlanzCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Should Ontario make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory for school?Analysis Why the delta variant means some Canadians now more 'at risk' from COVID-19 than ever before Why is there no flu amid so many COVID cases?

By Ed Cara Published July 12, 2021 | Comments (0) | ð Copied! A house sparrow (Passer domesticus) Photo: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP (Getty Images) Something is sickening and killing wild birds in multiple states, and no one knows what it is yet. Since May, wildlife experts and officials have reported unexplained die-offs throughout the Eastern half of the U.S. So far, the only thing clear is that these cases arenât being caused by common culprits like salmonella. The first reports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, emerged in late May from wildlife handlers in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky, as well as Washington D.C.; since then, similar reports from Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana have come in. The reports have involved songbirds (typically young) found with eyes that are swollen and/or have a crusty discharge on them, often rendering them blind. The birds also tend to have neurological symptoms that make it hard for them to navigate as usual, like dizziness and lethargy. âWe have received 300 birds so far,â Chelsea Jones, a spokesperson for the Animal Welfare League of Arlington, Virginia, told Live Science. âBut that is just counting the deceased birds; the real total is much higher.â A list of the birds affected include but are not limited to: blue jays, European starlings, common grackles, American robins, house sparrows, Eastern bluebirds, and red-bellied woodpeckers. Right now, experts only seem to have ruled out possible explanations. Tests havenât found the presence of salmonella and chlamydia bacteria, viruses like West Nile and avian influenza, nor other parasites like trichomonas in these birds, though more tests are ongoing. âI think whatâs especially challenging about this is that itâs not localized … to one specific geographic area [and] itâs not localized to one particular bird species,â Lisa Murphy, associate professor of toxicology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, told NPR last week. While the cause of this birdemic remains unknown, at this point, people and domestic birds donât seem to be in any danger themselves. And there are steps bird lovers can take to help minimize its potential spread. Agencies like the USGS have called for people in these affected areas to stop feeding wild birds for the moment, while people with bird feeders and bird baths should clean them with water mixed with 10% bleach. Ideally, you should also bring the feeders inside or out of use if possible, since they can serve as places for birds to crowd together. If you do see dead birds in your area, you should contact your local wildlife conservation agency and avoid directly handling them. But if you do try to handle them, then you should wear disposable gloves or use an inverted plastic bag to pick them up, and definitely keep them away from pets and other birds.

In this study, H9N2 avian influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) antigen, was targeted by fusing it to single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies specific to CD83 receptor expressed on chicken APCs. We observed an increased level of IFNγ, IL6, IL1β, IL4, and CxCLi2 mRNA upon stimulation of chicken splenocytes ex vivo by CD83 scFv targeted H9HA. In addition, CD83 scFv targeted H9HA induced higher serum haemagglutinin inhibition activity and virus neutralising antibodies compared to untargeted H9HA, with induction of antibodies as early as day 6 post primary vaccination. Furthermore, chickens vaccinated with CD83 scFv targeted H9HA showed reduced H9N2 challenge virus shedding compared to untargeted H9HA. These results suggest that targeting antigens to CD83 receptors could improve the efficacy of poultry vaccines.

However, many vaccines are administered in multiple doses, inducing sub-optimal immunity that might protect from clinical disease and death, but does not prevent shedding of infectious pathogens from vaccinated animals. Thus, the endemic cycle of disease continues. The challenge is to improve the effectiveness of vaccines to reduce transmission and increase protection from disease by inducing strong and long-lasting humoral and cellular immunity. In recent years, various strategies have been developed to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines. One such strategy is the recombinant targeted antigen delivery vaccine (TADV) whereby protective antigens are selectively delivered to professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, and B cells1. These cells capture, process, and present antigens to T lymphocytes for initiation and maintenance of immune responses. At present, either pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) agonist-or antibody-based conjugates, are used for targeting antigens to APCs. In PRR agonist-based APC targeting, antigens are conjugated to molecules such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), DNA containing unmethylated CpG motifs, or flagellin whereas in antibody-based targeting, antigens are conjugated to antibodies that recognise specific receptors on APCs2. Targeting antigens to APCs using antibody-based methods can be carried out by either chemically conjugating the antigen to a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for selected APC receptors or by genetic engineering in which the antigen is fused to antibody fragments such as single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies specific for the APC receptors3,4,5. The scFv antibodies have been popular for their use in antigen targeting due to their small size. They are the smallest unit of immunoglobulin molecule that holds a complete antigen-binding domain of an antibody and are 25−30 kDa in size6,7. They can be synthetically generated by connecting the variable domains (vH and vL) with a flexible short (16−20 amino acids) peptide linker. The scFv antibodies retain the binding specificity of the parent antibody and provide several advantages compared to the complete mAb IgG molecule containing the fragment crystalisable (Fc) region, in various therapeutic and diagnostic applications7. When antigens are targeted to specific receptors on APCs, their non-specific uptake can be reduced. This can increase the quantity of the antigens reaching the APCs.Previously, various studies explored antibody-based antigen targeting mammalian APCs via DC receptor for endocytosis-205 (Dec205)8,9,10. The first antigen-targeting study in chickens was also directed towards Dec205 receptor where the complete haemagglutinin (HA) protein of the H5N2 virus was chemically conjugated to anti-chicken Dec205 mAb. A single dose of this vaccine was shown to be sufficient to elicit a strong antibody response in chickens as early as fourteen days after priming10. Furthermore, targeting a synthetic peptide antigen to chicken CD40 receptor showed accelerated and enhanced antibody responses against the peptide antigen compared to untargeted peptide11. PRR-agonist-based targeting has also been investigated in chickens before. Song et al. generated a H7HA influenza subunit vaccine recombinantly fused to Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (H7HA-fliC). Immunisation of chickens with H7HA-fliC showed robust antibody responses leading to a significant reduction in viral loads compared to the chickens receiving only H7HA12. Various other receptors like CD11c, CD80, Clec9A, and MHC II have been used in mammals for antibody-based antigen targeting13,14,15,16,17,18,19. However, these APC receptors have not been examined in chickens for antigen targeting. One potential receptor molecule which has not yet been explored for antigen targeting in either the mammalian or the avian system is CD83. In mammals, CD83 is a surface glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. CD83 is predominantly expressed on DCs and is an early activation marker for DCs20. However, CD83 is also expressed in activated macrophages, natural killer cells, and activated T and B lymphocytes21. CD83 has been thought to be involved in immune response; however, its function on DCs and T cells remains unclear. Based on the expression profile of CD83 and its structural similarity with B7 family members (CD80/CD86), CD83 is thought to play important roles during interactions between cells of the immune system22. Recently, it was reported that CD83 plays a major role in B cell function for antibody production, in response to influenza A virus infection23. Moreover, chicken CD83 has been characterised, and was shown to have 39% and 40% amino acid sequence similarity to human and mouse CD83, respectively24.There are limited data available for targeting chicken APCs for modulating immunogenicity of poultry vaccines10. Here, we provide evidence that targeting chicken CD83 enhances the immunogenic potential of antigens by inducing faster and stronger immune responses. In this study, we selected avian influenza virus (AIV) H9N2 haemagglutinin (HA) as a model antigen reconstituted as a recombinant subunit vaccine. The HA protein lacking transmembrane domain (TM) was fused to scFv antibodies specific for chicken CD83 receptors and produced as a soluble trimeric protein in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CD83 receptor, being used for antigen targeting studies. This strategy could be used to develop new and effective vaccines against several infectious animal and human diseases.ResultsExpression and purification of the recombinant proteinsTo create a soluble H9HA protein, the TM domain of H9HA was replaced with the 30 amino acid long foldon of the trimeric protein fibritin from bacteriophage T4 (hereinafter referred to as rH9HA, Fig. 1a, b). Furthermore, rH9HA was fused to scFv antibody targeting the CD83 receptor protein on chicken APCs (hereinafter referred to as rH9HA-CD83 scFv). The CD83 scFv, rH9HA, and rH9HA-CD83 scFv proteins were expressed in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. Subsequent purification of the recombinant proteins by His-tag affinity chromatography produced proteins with the expected molecular weights of about 30 kDa for CD83 scFv, 70 kDa for rH9HA, and 100 kDa for rH9HA-CD83 scFv (Fig. 1c). For rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv proteins, a single polypeptide of about 70 and 100 kDa respectively was observed on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. This indicates that the recombinant rH9HA protein is expressed as a HA precursor (HA0). Based on recovered purified proteins, it was estimated that expression levels of recombinant proteins ranged from 10 to 20 mg/litre of culture supernatant.Fig. 1: Construction and purification of recombinant HA proteins.a Schematic representation of the full length HA protein of H9N2 (MsCon) virus. Precursor HA0 :1-560 amino acids (aa), HA1:19-338 aa, HA2: 339-560 aa, TM = transmembrane domain (525-547 aa) CT = cytosolic tail domain (548−560 aa). b Schematic representation of the soluble HA protein of H9N2 (MsCon) virus. The soluble H9HA was generated by removing the TM and CT domains (525-560 aa) and fusing the C-terminus of HA to 30 aa long trimerisation foldon sequence of the trimeric protein fibritin from T4 bacteriophage c His tag purification of the recombinant proteins. The expected sizes of the purified CD83 scFv antibody, rH9HA, and rH9HA-CD83 scFv are 30, 70, and 100 kDa respectively. Lane 1: control supernatant from the untransfected cells Lane 2: CD83 scFv Lane 3: rH9HA Lane 4: rH9HA-CD83 scFv. For the purification of the recombinant proteins, the harvested S2 cell culture supernatants containing recombinant protein bound to the metal ions (copper sulfate was used as an inducer of metallothionein promoter) were loaded onto uncharged “UNOsphere” resin derivatized with iminodiacetic acid functioning as a chelating ligand (Profinity™IMAC, Bio-Rad). Proteins were eluted with elution buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl and 50 mM imidazole. The purified proteins were analysed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. All blots were derived from the same experiment and were processed in parallel.Full size imageH9HA ectodomain fused to T4 bacteriophage foldon can trimerise and retain haemagglutination activityThe oligomerisation state of soluble H9HA protein with trimerisation foldon was determined by cross-linking using Bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate (BS3). Multimeric proteins exposed to this cross-linker will have each subunit cross-linked together with the formation of amide bonds25. This provides direct evidence for their close proximity26. This also helps to stabilise the structure of oligomers, allowing them to be resolved on SDS denaturing gels for western blot analysis25. This method was used to confirm the native structure of the protein. Recombinant rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv proteins were exposed to BS3 cross-linker and the cross-linked products were separated on SDS-PAGE gel under reducing and denaturing conditions, blotted, and immunodetected using anti-H9HA monoclonal antibody. The result is shown in Fig. 2a. Without BS3 crosslinking, three species: monomer, dimer, and trimer were observed (major band at monomer; Lane 1 and Lane 3 corresponding to about 70 and 100 kDa for rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv, respectively). With crosslinking, the stable trimeric form was observed (Lane 2 and Lane 4 corresponding to about 210 and 300 kDa for rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv, respectively). This indicates that the native structure of recombinant H9HA protein with foldon is a trimer, and three molecules of scFv antibodies are attached to one trimeric H9HA protein.Fig. 2: Analysis of the oligomeric form and activity of recombinant H9HA ectodomain containing foldon.a BS3 cross-linking experiment for determining the native structure of H9HA ectodomain with foldon.

About 15 µg of the recombinant protein was mixed with BS3 to a 10 mM final concentration and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 50 mM and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After cross-linking, proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, blotted, and analysed by western blot using anti-H9HA monoclonal antibody.

Negative control (PBS). For the haemagglutination assay, a two-fold serial dilution of 35 μg of the recombinant HA proteins was carried out in 96-well plates. About 50 μl of 1% chicken RBCs was added. The plates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and the highest dilution of the protein causing the agglutination of the RBCs was noted.Full size imageNext, the biological activity of soluble rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv proteins, was tested using haemagglutination assay (Fig. 2b). The soluble rH9HA protein, both on its own and when fused to CD83 scFv antibodies was able to agglutinate chicken red blood cells (RBCs) retaining its haemagglutination activity. An average amount of 0.14 μg of soluble rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv was required to observe haemagglutination activity.The fusion of CD83 scFv antibodies to rH9HA protein does not affect their functionTo determine whether the CD83 scFv antibodies can retain their activity after being fused to rH9HA protein, indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was carried out. Plates were coated with purified chicken CD83 protein (extracellular domain (ED)). CD83 mAb was included in the indirect ELISA assay as a positive control (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, rH9HA was used to assess the unspecific binding of rH9HA to chicken CD83 ED. Moreover, both CD83 scFv and rH9HA-CD83 scFv antibodies were able to detect and bind to chicken CD83 ED (Fig. 3b). Slightly lower binding to chicken CD83 ED by rH9HA-CD83 scFv antibodies was observed, although this was not statistically significant.Fig. 3: Characterisation of CD83 scFv and rH9HA-CD83 scFv for binding to chicken CD83 ectodomain using ELISA.a Indirect ELISA for testing the activity of CD83 mAb b Indirect ELISA for testing the activity of CD83 scFv and rH9HA-CD83 scFv. Purified 8 μg of chicken CD83 ectodomain was coated onto each well of the ELISA plate, a two-fold serial dilution was carried out and the plate was incubated overnight for 4 °C. For detection, the plates were incubated with an equimolar concentration of purified CD83 scFv and rH9HA-CD83 scFv or 1 μg/ml of CD83 mAb. This was followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse HRP secondary antibody for (a) and HRP-conjugated anti-V5 secondary antibody for (b). The colorimetric detection was carried out by adding TMB substrate and absorbance at 450 nm was recorded.Full size imageActivation of chicken splenocytes by CD83 scFv, rH9HA, and rH9HA- CD83 scFv proteins ex vivoSplenocytes were isolated from specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens and treated with CD83 scFv, rH9HA, and rH9HA-CD83 scFv proteins for 5, 22, and 30 h in vitro. The production of different cytokines such as IFNγ, IL1β, IL6, IL4, IL18, TNFα, and IL12, as well as the chemokine CxCLi2, was investigated to examine the immunogenic potential of our vaccine candidates; rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv. With regards to stimulation by CD83 scFv, CD83 scFv was able to induce significantly higher mRNA levels of IL6, IL1β, CxCLi2, and IL4 (p < 0.05) compared to the control scFv at some time points (Fig. 4a). There was little or no induction of IFNγ, IL18, TNFα, and IL12. For IFNγ, verification was also carried out using IFNγ ELISA (Fig. 4b).Fig. 4: Analysis of cytokine (IFNγ, IL6, IL1β, IL4, IL18, TNFα, and IL12) and chemokine (CXCLi2) mRNA levels in splenocytes upon stimulation with CD83 scFv, rH9HA, and rH9HA-CD83 scFv.a Cytokines and chemokine mRNA levels in splenocytes analysed using qRT-PCR. b IFNγ protein level analysed using ELISA. For a: splenocytes were isolated from the spleen of 3-week-old SPF chickens using Histopaque 1083 and stimulated with 10 μg of CD83 scFvH9HAH9HA-CD83 scFv for 5, 22, and 30 h in vitro. Stimulated splenocytes were harvested for RNA extraction and expression levels of the respective cytokines and chemokine were measured by qRT-PCR. Data were calculated using 2−∆∆CT approach (n-fold change compared to the media only control group) and reported as values normalised to the expression level of a housekeeping gene RPLPO1. For b: supernatants from the stimulated splenocytes were analysed for the presence of IFNγ by ELISA. Data are represented as mean ± SD and analysed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. ***p < 0.001 **p < 0.01 *p < 0.05. The data represent three independent experiments.Full size imageInterestingly, rH9HA-CD83 scFv stimulation showed an overall higher mRNA level of most of the cytokines tested compared to CD83 scFv. A significantly higher mRNA level of IFNγ, IL6, IL1β, CxCLi2, and IL4 (p < 0.05) was observed compared to rH9HA (Fig. 4a). There was little or no induction of IL18, TNFα, and IL12. Furthermore, IL6, IL1β, and CxCLi2 cytokines were induced earlier (5 h post stimulation) whereas IFNγ and IL4 were induced later (after 22 h post stimulation). Moreover, the expression of IFNγ in the supernatant after rH9HA-CD83 scFv induction was also verified using IFNγ ELISA assay (Fig. 4b). We also assessed the ability of rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv to stimulate chicken bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) for the production of different cytokines. The rH9HA-CD83 scFv was able to induce higher mRNA levels of the tested cytokines compared to rH9HA (Supplementary Fig. 1). This overall result suggests that rH9HA-CD83 scFv can promote the stimulation of chicken immune cells in vitro.Immunisation with rH9HA-CD83 scFv proteins induces a faster and higher humoral responseA standard haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was conducted to test the ability of rH9HA-CD83 scFv to generate H9HA specific antibodies. The serum antibody titres were measured at 6,14, 21, and 28 days post primary vaccination (ppv). With the 20 and 35 µg dose of rH9HA-CD83 scFv significantly higher amount of H9HA specific HI antibodies (p < 0.0001) were observed as early as day 6 ppv compared to the respective concentrations of rH9HA (Fig. 5). The HI antibody response induced by the 2 µg dose of rH9HA-CD83 scFv was slower when compared to that induced by 20 and 35 µg doses. However, after 14 days ppv even the 2 µg rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine group had HI antibody titre similar to the inactivated vaccine group. Furthermore, with the 20 and 35 µg doses of rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine group, the titre of HI antibodies produced was higher than rH9HA vaccine group at all the time points tested. Interestingly, there were no significant differences between the 2, 20, and 35 μg doses in rH9HA immunised groups at all the time points tested. However, with rH9HA-CD83 scFv significantly higher HI antibodies were produced with the 20 and 35 μg doses compared to the 2 μg dose on most of the time points tested (p < 0.0001 for day 6 ppv, p < 0.001 for day 14 ppv, p < 0.01 for day 28 ppv). Furthermore, the HI antibody titres with 20 μg and 35 μg of rH9HA-CD83 scFv were also significantly higher than that of the inactivated H9N2 virus vaccine group (p < 0.001 for day 6 ppv, p < 0.001 for day 14 ppv, p < 0.01 for day 28 ppv).Fig. 5: Analysis of HI antibodies in the serum of chickens vaccinated with rH9HA, rH9HA-CD83 scFv, and inactivated H9N2 virus.Groups of 7 days old chickens (n = 8) were immunised with 2.8, 28, and 49 µg of recombinant rH9HA-CD83 scFv equivalent to 2, 20, and 35 µg of recombinant rH9HA (equimolar concentration). Boost vaccination was given after 7 days post primary vaccination. The chickens were bled on day 6, 14, 21, and 28 posts primary vaccination. Antibody titres in sera were measured by haemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay. The highest dilution of serum inhibiting the agglutination of RBCs by H9N2 virus (UDL01/08) was recorded. Data are presented as mean ± SD and analysed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. ****p < 0.0001 ***p < 0.001 **p < 0.01 *p < 0.05. ppv post primary vaccination.Full size imageAn ELISA approach was used to determine the total anti-HA reactivity for different classes of antibody (IgM, IgY, and IgA) in the serum of the immunised chickens with 35 μg dose of vaccines at 6, 14, 21, and 28 days ppv. As expected27, the amount of anti-HA IgM and IgY antibodies were higher than IgA antibodies in the immunised serum (Fig. 6). On day 6 ppv the amount of anti-HA IgM and IgY antibodies were significantly higher in rH9HA-CD83 scFv group compared to rH9HA and inactivated H9N2 virus vaccine groups (p < 0.001). Furthermore, higher anti-HA IgM antibodies were also observed in rH9HA-CD83 scFv group compared to rH9HA group on day 14 ppv (p < 0.01). Moreover, no differences were observed in the amount of anti-HA IgY antibodies between rH9HA and rH9HA- CD83 scFv groups after day 14 ppv.Fig. 6: HA-specific IgM, IgY, and IgA antibody levels in the serum of chickens immunised with 35 μg dose of rH9HA, rH9HA-CD83 scFv, and inactivated H9N2 virus vaccines.The HA-specific isotypes of the antibodies were determined in 200-fold diluted sera collected at day 6, 14, 21, and 28 post primary vaccination by ELISA. The plates were coated with 1 μg of recombinant H9HA protein overnight at 4 °C. For detection, the plates were incubated with respective sera for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by further incubation for 1 h with 1:3000 diluted anti-chicken IgM, IgY, and IgA antibodies. The colorimetric detection was carried out by adding tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate and absorbance at 450 nm was recorded. The amount of HA-specific IgM, IgY, and IgA antibodies were expressed as a sample to reference ratio (relation of absorbance of a tested serum sample to the absorbance of the reference serum). Data are presented as mean ± SD and analysed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. ****p < 0.0001 ***p < 0.001 **p < 0.01 *p < 0.05. ppv post primary vaccination.Full size imageTo determine the effect of serum antibodies on viral biology, virus micro-neutralisation (MNT) test was also performed with immunised sera from 35 μg vaccine dose at 28 days ppv. The MNT assay is believed to be more sensitive than the HI assay, and it assesses the ability of the serum antibodies to block virus entry and productive replication28. The virus neutralisation antibody titre of rH9HA-CD83 scFv group was significantly higher than rH9HA and inactivated H9N2 virus vaccine groups (p < 0.01, Fig. 7).Fig. 7: Virus neutralising antibody titre measured by virus micro-neutralisation (MNT) test.Virus MNT was carried out on day 28 post primary vaccination serum samples (35 μg dose group). The serum was first inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min and two-fold serum dilutions were made in phosphate-buffered saline. Then, the inactivated serum was incubated with 150 TCID50 of H9N2 virus (UDL 01/08) for 1 h at 37 °C. The virus-serum mixture was then added onto the MDCK cells and further incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After 1 h of incubation, the virus-serum mixture was removed from the cells and fresh media containing 2 μg/ml trypsin was added. The cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution after 3 days. The virus neutralisation titre was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution at which virus infection is blocked and the cells survive. Data are presented as mean ± SD and analysed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. **p < 0.01.Full size imagerH9HA-CD83 scFv is better at reducing the viral load in H9N2 virus challenged chickens compared to rH9HATo determine the protective efficacy of rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine, groups of chickens were vaccinated twice (day 7 and day 14 old) with (i) rH9HA (ii) rH9HA-CD83 scFv (iii) inactivated H9N2 virus and (iv) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, negative control), and challenged with A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL 01/2008 (UDL01/08) H9N2 virus after 7 days post boost vaccination (day 22 old). The PBS treated and rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccinated groups also had un-infected chickens serving as contacts. The contact groups provide evidence on whether the vaccinated chickens have a reduced chance of getting an infection from the directly infected PBS control chickens while sharing the same air space, food, and water.The clinical signs observed in the virus-infected chickens include diarrhoea, rapid breathing, weight loss, eyes half shut, ruffled feathers, depression, and isolated behaviour. All vaccinated groups (direct and contact) had 100% survival rates compared with 58% in the directly infected PBS control group. In addition, the survival rate of the PBS treated contact group chickens was 87% (Fig. 8a). The average weight gain of all directly infected vaccinated chickens remained consistent, whereas the average weight gain in directly infected PBS control group chickens was significantly decreased on day 3 and day 4 post virus infection (p < 0.0001 for both days, Fig. 8b). Three chickens in the directly infected PBS control group showed severe clinical disease signs and were humanely culled due to ethical reasons on day 4 post virus infection. The chickens that survived had a similar average weight gain pattern as the vaccinated groups.Fig. 8: Survival and average weight gain of chickens after virus challenge.a Percentage survival between vaccinated and PBS treated control chickens challenged with H9N2 virus. Directly infected and contact birds were monitored for clinical disease signs throughout the study duration. Birds that reached the humane endpoints were culled due to ethical reasons. Survival curves between directly infected PBS control group (black line) and directly infected or contact vaccinated groups (blue line) significantly different P-value ≤ 0.05 (log-rank (Mantel−Cox) test). b Percentage average weight gain per day between vaccinated and PBS treated control chickens challenged with H9N2 virus. Chickens were weighted daily during the study duration. Data are analysed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Statistical significance between the vaccinated and PBS treated control groups is shown with asterisks ****p < 0.0001.Full size imageThe viral load in chickens was determined by plaque assays of buccal and cloacal swabs collected from day 1 to day 7 post infection. No cloacal virus shedding was observed in any chickens challenged with H9N2 virus (data not shown). Viral titres in the buccal swabs collected from vaccinated groups on day 1, 2, 3, and 4 post infection remained significantly lower compared to the PBS control group (Figs. 9a, b). The average viral load, in directly infected PBS control groups, ranged from 23 000 to 12 000 pfu/ml on the first three days post virus infection, whereas for vaccinated groups the average viral load ranged from 6200 to 390 pfu/ml. Furthermore, the rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccinated chickens had significantly lower average viral load compared to rH9HA vaccinated chickens on day 2 post infection (rH9HA-CD83 scFv: 1220 pfu/ml, rH9HA: 3052 pfu/ml) and day 3 post infection (rH9HA-CD83 scFv: 390 pfu/ml, rH9HA: 1257 pfu/ml). There were not any significant differences between rH9HA-CD83 scFv and inactivated virus vaccine groups in terms of viral load. By day 4 post infection, the virus was almost cleared from all the directly infected vaccinated groups, whereas some virus remained detectable (<2 log10 pfu/ml) in the directly infected PBS control group. In addition, the rH9HA-CD83 scFv contact group chickens had significantly lower viral load compared with those in the PBS contact group (Fig. 9a, c). These results clearly demonstrate that the rH9HA-CD83 scFv induced a strong HA-specific antibody response that resulted in reduced clinical disease signs, virus shedding, and mortality.Fig. 9: Challenge virus shedding profiles from the buccal cavity of vaccinated and PBS treated control chickens infected with H9N2 virus (UDL 01/08).Groups of 7-day-old chickens (n = 7) were immunised with 35 µg of recombinant rH9HA-CD83 scFv equivalent to 25 µg of recombinant rH9HA (equimolar concentration). The second vaccine dose as boost was given on day 7 post primary vaccination. The chickens were challenged with 100 μl of 1 × 107 pfu/ml H9N2 virus (UDL 01/2008) after 7 days post boost vaccination. Some of the vaccinated and control birds were left unchallenged to serve as contacts. Swabs were taken from the buccal cavity until day 7 post infection and the amount of live virus particles recovered from swabs was titrated via plaque assays and presented as plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml. a Shedding profiles of each chicken from the buccal cavity at different days post infection are indicated by a single coloured dot. b The average shedding profile from the buccal cavity per group for directly infected birds. c The average shedding profile from buccal cavity per group for contact birds.

There is a critical need to improve the immunogenicity of poultry vaccines and one strategy is based upon enhancing delivery to professional APCs, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Here, we designed and developed a vaccine based on targeted delivery of the HA antigen of H9N2 influenza virus. The H9HA was produced as a trimeric soluble glycoprotein and recombinantly fused with an scFv portion of an antibody that is specific for the chicken CD83 molecule. Best characterised in mice and humans, CD83 is most highly expressed on mature DCs but can also be expressed on other cell types including B cells, macrophages, and NK cells21. The soluble H9HA protein was produced by eliminating the transmembrane domain and fusing the C-terminus of H9HA protein to trimerisation foldon of T4 bacteriophage. The fusion of H9HA protein with CD83 scFv antibody does not seem to abrogate the functional activity of both HA as well as the scFv antibodies. The recombinant rH9HA-CD83 scFv produced in Drosophila S2 cells and secreted into the culture medium retained functional activity to agglutinate RBCs in HA assay and the CD83 scFv antibody fused to HA was able to detect and bind to chicken CD83 ED in ELISA assay.The vaccination of chickens with H9HA antigen carrying CD83 receptor-specific scFv induced faster and stronger immunity compared to the H9HA antigen lacking CD83 receptor-specific scFv. The mechanism by which rH9HA-CD83 scFv triggered this enhancement is not fully clear. It is surprising that high antibody responses were observed in the absence of DC-activating adjuvants like LPS and CpG oligonucleotides, suggesting that the side effects of these adjuvants could be avoided by using CD83 scFv targeted vaccine. Studies have shown that anti-CD83 antibodies have immunosuppressive potential thus, they can be used for the treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which occurs after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant due to the cascades of inflammatory reactions of donor immune cells29,30. Here, we evaluated the potential enhancing effects of CD83 scFv and rH9HA-CD83 scFv in vitro on chicken splenocytes, by examining the cytokine mRNA expression levels. CD83 scFv on its own induced moderate upregulation of mRNA encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines i.e., IL6, IL1β, and CxCLi2, but no IFNγ. Interestingly, when CD83 scFv was fused to rH9HA, we observed higher upregulation of mRNA encoding IFNγ, along with other cytokines like IL6, IL1β, CxCLi2, and IL4. It has been suggested that antigen binding to the antibody could result in conformational changes in the antibody. This can enhance the ingestion of antigen-antibody complexes by Fc receptor-containing cells compared to the free antibody31. In our case, we have used scFv antibodies lacking Fc region. However, H9HA protein fusion to CD83 scFv antibodies could have induced some structural changes, allowing the rH9HA-CD83 scFv complex to be readily uptaken by the APCs and thus, increasing the immunostimulatory potential of the antigen.The results from the in vivo dose titration vaccination study suggested that the serum HI antibody titres were higher for chickens vaccinated with 20 and 35 µg rH9HA-CD83 scFv compared to rH9HA. Furthermore, the HI antibodies were produced as early as 6 days ppv with 20 and 35 µg doses of rH9HA-CD83 scFv compared to rH9HA. Thus, we predict that the optimal vaccine dose for faster and higher humoral response with rH9HA-CD83 scFv could be between 20 and 35 µg although, chickens vaccinated with 2 µg displayed similar HI antibody titres by 21 days ppv. An earlier study in which a complete HA protein was chemically conjugated with Dec205 mAb reported an increased serum antibody titre with 50 and 100 µg per dose of the targeted protein10. In our study, we observed a good antibody response with lower doses of CD83 scFv targeted H9HA vaccine (20 µg/35 μg). This provides an additional advantage of dose sparing. However, only a single dose of vaccine was used in the former study, whereas in this study, two doses of vaccine were used. Furthermore, the second vaccination was given just seven days after the first vaccination. It has been shown that an interval of several weeks between the first and second vaccination is important to obtain optimal immune responses32. Therefore, it is possible that our vaccination regime might not have given us the maximum immune responses. Several studies have reported that inactivated virus vaccines are better at evoking higher HI antibodies compared to subunit vaccines33,34,35,36,37. In this study, we observed that recombinant rH9HA-CD83 scFv produced higher serum HI and virus neutralising antibodies compared to the inactivated virus vaccine. It has been reported that anti-CD83 mAb can have an adjuvant effect by modulating B cell function38,39. Mice injected with nitroiodophenol conjugated to Ficoll (NIP-Ficoll) along with anti-CD83 mAb showed a dramatic increase in the production of NIP-specific IgG1 antibodies, indicating that the ligation of anti-CD83 mAb to naturally induced CD83 receptor protein strongly affects antigen-specific IgG responses of B cells in vivo39. This could be a potential reason for the enhancement of antibody response by CD83 scFv targeted H9HA subunit vaccine. Some mammalian APC targeting studies have shown to induce both humoral and T cell-mediated immunity (CMI)40,41. We assessed CMI induced by rH9HA and rH9HA-CD83 scFv by using IFNγ ELISPOT. However, due to the lack of optimal recall antigen, no CMI was observed with IFNγ ELISPOT assay (data not shown). In addition, we also tested in vivo IFNγ response using RNA from the vaccinated spleens on day 2, 4, 6, 8, and 21 ppv, but failed to detect any upregulation (Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate the CMI elicited by rH9HA-CD83 scFv.In terms of protection, rH9HA-CD83 scFv was better at reducing the viral load in the H9N2 virus-challenged chickens compared to rH9HA, at a level comparative to the inactivated virus vaccine. With the inactivated virus vaccine, antibodies are produced not just for HA protein but also for other viral proteins like neuraminidase and matrix protein 2. It is therefore promising that the recombinant rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine induced a similar level of protection to the industry standard inactivated H9N2 virus vaccine. One of the key characters of the inactivated vaccines is that the viral material also includes a range of products capable of stimulating innate immunity via pattern recognition receptor-based activation of immune cells such as DCs34,35. This activating character is often not as strong with recombinant protein vaccines where it needs to be entirely delivered by the adjuvant carrier. In the case of the rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine, we were able to demonstrate activation of ex vivo splenocytes via the anti-CD83 effect to induce upregulation of mRNA encoding inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, IL1β, and IL6) and the chemokine CXCLi2. All of these indicate activation of immune cells which could combine to enhance immune responses as indicated by the high levels of antibodies and protective effect detected with this vaccination strategy.To conclude, this study exploits the specificity and high-affinity binding properties of antibodies to create TADV for avian influenza in poultry. The approach using CD83 targeting led to high levels of effective antibodies (as measured by HI and MNT) and detectable antigen-specific responses with all classes of antibody in the chicken (IgM, IgY, and IgA). Most importantly, the recombinant rH9HA-CD83 scFv was effective at reducing the viral load in chickens to levels greater than rH9HA and equivalent to the industry standard inactivated virus approach. This CD83 targeting approach represents a powerful addition to the armoury of the developers of poultry vaccines reducing the need to grow large quantities of live virus for inactivated AIV vaccines. A similar approach could also be used in the development of safe, effective vaccines against other poultry and livestock diseases.MethodsEthics statementAll animal studies and procedures were carried out in strict accordance with the guidance and regulations of European and United Kingdom Home Office regulations under project licence number P68D44CF4. All animal work was reviewed and approved by the Animal Welfare Ethical Review Body at The Pirbright Institute.Viruses and cellsA/Chicken/Pakistan/UDL 01/2008 (UDL01/08) H9N2 virus was propagated in 10-day-old SPF embryonated hens’ eggs and titrated by plaque assay or TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) on Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The virus was inactivated chemically using 0.1% beta-propiolactone (BPL, Alfa Aesar) and purified by ultracentrifugation through a continuous 30−60% w/v sucrose gradient.MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified eagle medium (DMEM, Merck Life Science) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 (S2) cells were obtained from Thermofisher Scientific and maintained in Schneider’s insect medium (Merck Life Science) supplemented with 10% FBS at 25 °C.Construction of CD83 scFv and H9HA fused CD83 scFv protein-expressing plasmidsThe mouse hybridoma clone of chicken CD83 (clone: IAH F890:GE8) was produced at the Institute for Animal Health (now The Pirbright Institute) by immunising mice with chicken CD83 antigen (GenBank accession number: XM_040663657.1)42. The variable light (vL) chain and variable heavy (vH) chain sequences were derived from the hybridoma clones commercially (Absolute Antibody Ltd). Synthetic cDNA containing the vL and vH sequences of APC-mAb were joined by (Gly4Ser)4 linker peptide sequence and manufactured commercially by Geneart (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The respective individual vL-Linker-vH cDNA were then cloned into Drosophila melanogaster expression vector (pMT-BIP-V5-His version A, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the Not I and Xba I restriction sites (Supplementary Figure 2). The resultant vector named pMT-BIP-CD83 scFv-V5-His was used to insert ectodomain of H9HA gene that lacks both HA gene signal peptide and the TM domain, replaced with a 30 amino acid trimerisation foldon sequence of the trimeric protein fibritin from bacteriophage T4, using Kpn I and Pac I restriction sites (Fig. 1b). The HA used in this study was synthetically produced incorporating consensus sequence of HA of H9N2 viruses derived from analysis of over 2000 H9HA sequences (from the public database) of G1-like H9 virus lineage using Minimum Sphere Consensus (MScon) method (developed by Jan Kim, The Pirbright Institute, UK). This synthetic HA has 98% amino acid sequence similarity to HA ectodomain of H9N2 virus (UDL01/08) (GenBank accession number: ACP50708.1, HA1: 19-338, and HA2: 339-560).Expression and purification of CD83 scFv and H9HA fused CD83 scFv proteinsRecombinant proteins were produced and purified using Drosophila Expression System (DES®, Life technologies). Briefly, pMT-BIP-CD83 scFv-V5-His, pMT-BIP-rH9HA-V5-His, or pMT-BIP-rH9HA-CD83 scFv-V5-His plasmids were co-transfected into Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells together with a hygromycin B resistance plasmid (pCoHYGRO, Life technologies). Antibiotic selection was carried out for four weeks using hygromycin B at a concentration of 250 µg/ml and a single cell clone was obtained via limiting dilution43. Recombinant proteins were secreted into culture supernatant after CuSO4 (500 µM) induction and then purified by Profinity™IMAC uncharged column (Bio-Rad). Protein expression was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 10−12% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) followed by Coomassie staining (Life Technologies). Furthermore, proteins were also transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham) for western blotting using anti-H9HA monoclonal antibodies44. The concentration of purified recombinant proteins was determined by Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Characterisation of CD83 scFv and rH9HA-CD83 scFv proteinsIndirect ELISA was carried out to examine if CD83 scFv and rH9HA-CD83 scFv proteins can detect and bind to chicken CD83 ectodomain. The coding sequence of the chicken CD83 ectodomain42 was cloned into pMT-BIP-His vector for expression in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. Briefly, 8 μg of the respective receptor proteins were added onto the first well of 96 well maxisorp ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, a two-fold dilution of the respective receptor proteins was made in carbonate buffer (15 mM NaCO3, 35 mM NaHCO3, 3 mM NaN3). The plates were incubated at 4 °C overnight. For detection, the plates were incubated with equimolar concentration of the CD83 scFv and rH9HA-CD83 scFv or 1 μg/ml of CD83 mAb for 1 h at 4 °C. This was followed by further incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP) anti-V5 secondary antibody (Bio-Rad Antibodies, primary antibody: CD83 scFv or rH9HA-CD83 scFv) or goat anti-mouse HRP secondary antibody (Bio-Rad Antibodies, primary antibody: CD83 mAb). The colorimetric detection was carried out by adding Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and read at wavelength 450 nm in ELx808 absorbance microplate reader (BioTek).Bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate (BS3) crosslinkingTo determine the oligomeric structure of the recombinant H9HA containing trimerisation foldon domain, cross-linking was performed using BS3 (Thermofisher Scientific) as described by Weldon et al.45 with the following modifications. Briefly, 15 µg recombinant protein was incubated at room temperature in the presence of BS3 (final concentration 10 mM) for 1 h. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 to a final concentration of 50 mM. The cross-linked products were separated on SDS gel under reducing conditions, blotted, and immunodetected using anti-H9HA monoclonal antibody44.Preparation and stimulation of chicken splenocytesSplenocytes were prepared from the spleens of 3-week-old SPF chickens (Rhode Island Red, Roslin) via density gradient centrifugation by using Histopaque 1083 (Merck Life Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. About 2 × 106 cells were plated on each well of a 24-well plate suspended in 300 μl of complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI) medium containing 10% FBS and 0.1% penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were treated with 10 μg of rH9HA or 14 μg of rH9HA-CD83 scFv (containing 10 μg rH9HA according to the molecular weight) or 10 μg of CD83 scFv or 10 μg of control scFv (anti-H9HA). All cells were stimulated for 5, 22, and 30 h in vitro at 41 °C.RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) of cytokines and chemokinesRNA was extracted from the stimulated splenocytes using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To perform RNA quantification, single-step real-time reverse transcription PCR was done using Superscript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Life Technologies) as per the manufacturer’s protocol in 7500 fast real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). Cycling conditions include: (i) 50 °C for 5 min, (ii) 95 °C for 2 min and (iii) 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 3 s followed by annealing and extension at 60 °C for 30 s. Sequences of primers and probes used for qRT-PCR are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Cycle threshold (CT) values were obtained using 7500 software version 2.3. Data were calculated using the 2−∆∆CT approach (n-fold change compared to the media only control group) and reported as values normalised to the expression level of a housekeeping gene RPLPO1 (Ribosomal phosphoprotein lateral stalk subunit PO). Out of the three reference genes (RPLPO-1, RPL13, and 28S) selected for normalisation, RPLPO1 was the most stable gene across samples and hence was chosen for normalisation.IFNγ sandwich ELISASupernatants from the stimulated splenocytes were harvested and examined by sandwich ELISA. Briefly, anti-chicken IFNγ (2 μg/ml, Invitrogen) was coated onto 96-well maxisorp ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The coated plates were blocked at room temperature with PBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h. A 1:2 dilution of the supernatants was made in PBS buffer containing 3% BSA. The plates were then incubated with the diluted supernatants for 2 h at room temperature. Detection was carried out using biotinylated anti-chicken IFNγ detection antibody (1 μg/ml, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature followed by HRP conjugated streptavidin (1:1000 dilution, Amersham) for another 1 h at room temperature. A 100 μl of Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (BD biosciences) was added for 10 min. The reaction was stopped using 2 M H2SO4 and read at wavelength 450 nm in ELx808 Absorbance Microplate Reader (BioTek).Haemagglutination assay and Haemagglutination inhibition assayWorld Health Organisation guidelines were followed for HI assay46 and haemagglutination assay was performed as previously described47. For the HI assay, two-fold serial dilution of the serum was prepared by mixing 25 μl of serum with 25 μl PBS. Next, four HA units of the H9N2 virus (UDL01/08) were added to the diluted serum and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Finally, 50 μl of 1% chicken red blood cells were added onto the serum−virus mixture and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. HI titres were expressed as reciprocal of the highest dilution of antiserum that causes total inhibition of four HA units of virus hemagglutination activity.Chicken vaccination and blood sample collectionGroups of 7-day-old SPF chickens (Dekalb White, Henry Stewart & Co.Ltd) (n = 8 per group) were immunised with vaccine dose containing 2.8, 28, and 49 µg of recombinant rH9HA-CD83 scFv proteins equivalent to 2, 20, and 35 µg of recombinant rH9HA (equimolar concentration). The proteins were formulated in Montanide ISA 71 R VG (Seppic) as water-in-oil emulsion. The ratio of protein to adjuvant volume was 1:2. The vaccine dose (0.2 ml) was administered subcutaneously at the back of the neck. Control groups were immunised with PBS. Additionally, one group of chickens (n = 8) was vaccinated with inactivated H9N2 virus (UDL01/08, ~1 × 108 EID50 (50% egg infectious dose) per ml). All vaccinated groups received a second booster dose at 14 days old. In all cases, blood samples were collected from the wing vein 6, 14, 21, and 28 days post primary vaccination.Viral challenge and swab sample collectionTo evaluate the protective efficacy of vaccines against virus challenge, groups of 7-day-old SPF chickens (Rhode Island Red, from The National Avian Research Facility at Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, UK) were divided into groups (n = 7 per group) and each chicken was injected subcutaneously with 0.2 ml dose of vaccine or PBS (as control) at day 7 and 14 days of age. The vaccine groups include: (G1) inactivated H9N2 vaccine containing UDL 01/08 virus (~1 × 108 EID50 per ml), (G2) rH9HA vaccine (25 μg/dose), (G3) rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine (25 μg/dose equivalent of rH9HA) and (G4) PBS control. Two additional groups (G5 and G6) were also included to serve as contacts that received PBS and rH9HA-CD83 scFv vaccine, respectively. Groups were housed in two separate isolators. The groups in isolator-1 include (G1) inactivated H9N2 virus (direct), (G2) rH9HA (direct), and (G3) rH9HA-CD83 scFv (direct). The groups in isolator-2 include (G4) PBS control (direct), (G5) PBS control (contact), and (G6) rH9HA-CD83 scFv (contact). All chickens in groups (G1−G4) except the contact groups (G5 and G6) were inoculated intranasally with 1 × 106 plaque-forming units (PFU)/100 μl of H9N2 virus (UDL01/08) at day 22 old (14 days after the primary vaccination). Chickens were monitored daily for clinical signs and weight changes throughout the experiment.Swab samples from buccal and cloacal cavities were collected daily until day 7 post infection with the last sampling performed on day 10 post infection. Sterile polyester tipped swabs were transferred into the virus transport media48, vortexed, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4500 rpm to clarify the medium. Samples were stored at −80 °C until further analysis.Measurement of serum IgM, IgY, and IgA anti-HA antibody levelsAntigen-specific IgM, IgY, and IgA antibody levels in the sera were determined by ELISA assay. Briefly, flat-bottom 96-well maxisorp ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with 1 μg of recombinant rH9HA protein diluted in 50 μl of carbonate buffer (15 mM NaCO3, 35 mM NaHCO3, 3 mM NaN3) overnight at 4 °C. Protein-coated plates were blocked at room temperature with 5% milk powder (Marvel) in PBS-tween 0.1% (PBS-T) for 1 h. Plates were washed thrice with wash buffer PBS-T. Chicken sera was diluted to 1:200 in PBS-T buffer containing 1% skimmed milk powder (Marvel). The plates were then incubated with 50 μl of the diluted sera at room temperature for 1 h. Plates were again washed thrice and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 50 μl of goat anti-chicken IgM (Life Technologies), IgY (Bio-Rad) and IgA (Life Technologies) antibody conjugated to HRP diluted in PBS-T buffer (1:3000 for IgM and IgA, 1:6000 for IgY) with 1% milk powder. Plates were washed ×4 with PBS-T then 100 μl of TMB substrate (BD biosciences) was added for 10 min. The reaction was stopped using 2 M H2SO4 and read at wavelength 450 nm in ELx808 Absorbance Microplate Reader (BioTek). A standard reference serum (serum collected from 35-day-old chicken (1:200 dilution) challenged with H9N2 virus (UDL01/08) was included in all assays. The amount of anti-HA IgM, IgY, or IgA antibodies were expressed as a sample to reference ratio (relation of absorbance of a tested serum sample to the absorbance of the reference serum).Plaque assayThe virus titre from the allantoic fluid or swab samples was obtained using plaque assay. Pre-seeded 12-well plates with MDCK cells were inoculated with ten-fold serially diluted sample in PBS and left for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and overlaid with DMEM (1× MEM, 0.21% BSA, 1 mM L-glutamate, 0.15% sodium bicarbonate, 10 mM Hepes, 0.1% penicillin G/streptomycin) containing 0.6% purified agar (Oxoid) and 2 µg/ml N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) trypsin (Merck Life Science). Cells were left at 37 °C for 72 h. After 3 days, culture media was removed, and cells were stained in crystal violet solution (Merck Life Science) for 30 min.Virus micro-neutralisation testMDCK cells were pre-seeded into 96 well plates to reach 90−95% confluency. The immunised chicken sera were inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min. Then, 1:200 dilution of the inactivated serum was carried out in PBS. This was followed by a further two-fold serial dilution in triplicates and mixed with 90 μl of H9N2 virus (UDL01/08) containing 150 TCID50. The serum−virus mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS and inoculated with the serum−virus mixture for 1 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, cells were washed once again with PBS and serum-free DMEM containing 2 µg/ml TPCK trypsin was added, cells were left at 37 °C for 72 h. After 3 days the medium was removed, and cells were stained in 0.1% crystal violet solution for 30 min. Virus MNT titres were expressed as reciprocal of the highest dilution of antiserum that blocks the virus infectivity in cultured cells inoculated with 150 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose).Statistical analysisResults are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance (p-values) was determined using a one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparison test, log-rank (Mantel−Cox) test (survival plot), and unpaired Student’s t-test using Prism 8.3.0 (GraphPad Software). Differences were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. Data availability Data that support the findings of this study are included in the article and supplementary information.

However, diagnosis efficacy remains unclear. This study examined the efficacy of a colloidal gold rapid test for rapid influenza diagnosis. Clinical characteristics of 520 patients with influenza-like illness presenting at a fever outpatient clinic during two influenza seasons (2017–2018; 2018–2019) were evaluated. The clinical manifestations and results of routine blood, colloidal gold, and nucleic acid tests were used to construct a decision tree with three layers, nine nodes, and five terminal nodes. The combined positive predictive value of a positive colloidal gold test result and monocyte level within 10.95–12.55% was 88.2%. The combined negative predictive value of a negative colloidal gold test result and white blood cell count > 9.075 × 109/L was 84.9%. The decision-tree model showed the satisfactory accuracy of an early influenza diagnosis based on colloidal gold and routine blood test results.

According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, influenza viruses infect between 5 and 15% of the global population, causing an estimated 3–5 million severe cases and up to 650,000 respiratory deaths a year1,2. There is no influenza-specific treatment, although antiviral drugs and supportive treatments are used to alleviate discomfort, shorten the disease course, and reduce the mortality risk. However, in some countries and regions, the lack of accurate and rapid influenza diagnostics has resulted in widespread misuse of antibiotics administered to patients while awaiting an influenza diagnosis.Craddock et al.3 reported that 17.2 and 25.4% of viral acute upper respiratory tract infections (AURTI) were inappropriately treated with antibiotics at urban internal medicine (IM) and family medicine (FM) ambulatory care clinics, respectively. A previous study reported that, among 6136 patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs), 2522 (41%) had diagnoses for which antibiotics are not indicated; moreover, 2106 (84%) patients were diagnosed as having a viral upper respiratory tract infection or bronchitis4. Another study showed that 40% of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) were treated with antibiotics in the post-pandemic influenza period5. Furthermore, antibiotic prescriptions from deidentified administrative claims data reached 9.8 million in 2013–2015, and antibiotics prescribed to 3.9 million insurance beneficiaries were used mainly for respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold and seasonal flu6. This evidence suggests that the ability to distinguish cases of influenza from influenza-like diseases can improve the efficacy of aggressive treatment approaches and reduce antibiotic misuse.Eboigbodin et al.7 showed that the present rapid influenza diagnostic methods, including onsite rapid nucleic acid tests, allow prompt treatment of patients and limit the inappropriate use of antibiotics and antiviral drugs, although they are expensive. The combined use of a conventional colloidal gold test with routine blood tests and the clinical symptoms has some efficacy in influenza diagnosis despite a low overall performance8. Antibiotic misuse is a global problem, and regional antibiotic misuse may increase the prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria contributing to the global risk of infectious diseases9. Considering these challenges, developing an effective and economical rapid influenza diagnosis method is of paramount importance.Studies have previously used statistical methods to construct an accurate disease, diagnostic model. These proposed models were based on patient characteristics and intended to leverage known markers for the diagnosis. The Classification Regression Tree (CRT)-based decision tree models are considered representative of clinical diagnosis, and their conclusions are easy to communicate and applicable in clinical practice. Recently, decision tree-based diagnostic models have been increasingly used in various disciplines. In influenza-related research, nucleic acid test results are used as a diagnostic gold standard reference for colloidal gold tests, with the clinical presentation and results of routine blood tests. The primary objective of this study was to establish a rapid diagnostic model for influenza patients based on colloid gold tests and clinical characteristics.ResultsTable 1 presents the clinical presentation characteristics of 520 patients with influenza-like illness.Table 1 Clinical presentations of 520 patients with influenza-like illness.Full size tableCorrelation between clinical presentation and nucleic acid test resultsA total of 520 patients were divided into two groups based on the results of the nucleic acid test: 271 with “positive” nucleic acid test results and 249 patients with “negative” nucleic acid test results. Among the 271 patients with positive nucleic acid test results, there were 116 cases of H1N1 (2009) influenza A, 55 cases of seasonal influenza H3, 69 cases of Yamagata (BY) influenza B, and 31 cases of Victoria (BV) influenza B. The sex and age were unassociated with nucleic acid test results. Patients with a positive nucleic acid test result had a slightly longer disease course (t = 2.429, P = 0.015). The average body temperature of both groups was similar (38.75 ± 0.52 vs. 38.67 ± 0.54, t = 1.656, P = 0.098). The positive group had a higher proportion of patients with cough, runny nose, and chills than in the negative group (χ2 = 7.540, 10.412, and 8.035, respectively; P = 0.006, 0.001, and 0.005, respectively). In the positive group, a higher number of patients underwent a colloidal gold test than in the negative group (χ2 = 14.848, P < 0.001). Furthermore, patients in the positive group had a lower WBC count and neutrophil percentage, and higher lymphocyte percentage and monocyte percentage than patients in the negative group (t = −4.256, −2.140, 2.004, and 2.836, respectively; P < 0.001, 0.033, 0.046, and 0.005, respectively; Table 2).Table 2 Correlation between clinical characteristics and influenza diagnosis.Full size tableDiagnostic performance of clinical characteristics associated with a definitive diagnosis of influenzaNucleic acid testing of both positive and negative groups, showed differences in clinical characteristics, mainly including disease course, cough and expectoration, runny nose, chills, colloidal test, routine blood test white blood cell count, neutrophils %, lymphocytes %, monocytes %, with confirmed influenza nucleic acid detection. Further analysis showed the clinical characteristics in the confirmed diagnosis efficacy (Table 3).Table 3 Diagnostic performance of clinical characteristics associated with a definitive diagnosis of influenza.Full size tableDecision tree-based examination of possible paths for further influenza screeningA positive nucleic acid test result was used as the gold standard for the diagnosis of influenza, and the colloidal gold test, clinical presentation, and routine blood test results were used as independent variables. The CRT algorithm was used to construct a decision tree that had three layers, nine nodes, and five terminal nodes (Fig. 1). There were two main decision cues. Patients with influenza-like illness (n = 520) were classified according to the value of the colloidal gold test node. Of the 236 patients with a negative colloidal gold test result, 165 had a negative nucleic acid test result, yielding a negative predictive value (NPV) of 69.9% for the colloidal gold method. Patients with a negative colloidal gold test result were further classified based on their WBC count: of the 105 patients with WBC count > 9.075 × 109/L, 87 had a negative nucleic acid test result, implying that the NPV of this characteristic was 82.9%, which made it a decision cue candidate. The NPV of the colloidal gold method with WBC count > 9.075 × 109/L was 82.9%.Fig. 1: Results of the influenza diagnostic decision tree analysis.The CRT algorithm was used to construct a decision tree that had three layers, nine nodes, and five terminal nodes.Full size imageSubsequently, 520 patients with influenza-like illness were classified according to the colloidal gold test results, and 284 patients with a positive colloidal gold test result were further classified according to the monocyte count. Thus, 140 out of 182 patients with the monocyte percentage > 10.95% had positive nucleic acid test results; the positive predictive value (PPV) was 76.9%. Moreover, among 140 patients, when the monocyte percentage was < 12.55% was used for classification, 62 out of 69 patients who met this criterion had a positive nucleic acid test result, and the PPV was 89.9%. These results indicate that these factors are potential candidates for decision cues. The PPV of the colloidal gold method with monocyte percentage within 10.95–12.55% was 89.9%. These factors are important contributors toward a definitive diagnosis of influenza.Verification of influenza screening pathway in the decision treeIn the 2019–2020 influenza season, 156 influenza-like illness cases were clinically diagnosed according to the decision tree before the nucleic acid test of pharyngeal swabs was performed. The nucleic acid test results of the 156 cases were as follows: 75 were positive (53 cases of influenza A H3, 6 cases of 2009 H11 influenza A, 16 cases of influenza B Victoria) and 81 were negative. According to the screening path of the decision tree analysis, the NPV of the node 2 colloidal gold test was 68.6%, and that of the node 6 colloidal gold test with negative results combined with WBC > 9.075 × 109/L increased to 81.0%. The PPV of the node 4 colloidal gold test combined with mononuclear cells > 10.95% was 88.6%, while that of the node 7 colloidal gold test combined with mononuclear cells within 10.95–12.55% increased to 90.9%. These results were consistent with those of the decision tree (Table 4).Table 4 Verification results of the decision tree of 156 influenza-like illness cases in 2019–2020.Full size tableDiscussionThis study included patients from the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 influenza seasons and used data from the 2019–2020 influenza season to verify the results. The results of the decision tree analysis revealed that clinical symptoms did not determine the diagnosis of influenza. However, differentiating the clinical presentation of influenza from that of influenza-like disease is challenging. Therefore, the use of the colloidal gold test and routine blood tests, including WBC and monocyte count are key factors for an accurate influenza diagnosis. This study used decision tree analysis to show that a colloidal gold test and routine blood tests can increase the accuracy of the rapid diagnosis of influenza. The PPV of a positive result on the colloidal gold test combined with a monocyte percentage within 10.95–12.55% was 88.2%. The NPV of the negative result on the colloidal gold test combined with a WBC count > 9.075 × 109/L was 84.9%. These findings suggest that a decision tree model can significantly increase the PPV and NPV for the rapid influenza diagnosis.In this study, sore throat, cough, dizziness and headache, and myalgia and arthralgia were the four most common symptoms despite an incidence of only 53–67%, which suggested that many patients with the influenza-like disease do not have a typical respiratory tract or systemic symptoms. In this study, there were significant differences in the prevalence of cough, productive cough, runny nose, and chills between the positive and negative nucleic acid test result groups (P < 0.05). However, further analysis has shown that their diagnostic performance was low, with the PPV and NPV in the range of 56.8–62.6% and 50.7–55.6%, respectively. Clinical symptoms were not included in the final decision tree, suggesting that they are insufficient to differentiate between influenza and non-influenza disease in clinical practice.The influenza colloidal gold test is widely used by many major medical institutions for influenza screening because it is rapid (results within 15–20 min), easy to use, does not require any special equipment, can be performed at the bedside, and all medical staff can be trained in its use. However, its sensitivity varies. In this study, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the colloidal gold influenza A test was 52.9%, 74.2%, 72.4%, and 55.2%, respectively, and the corresponding values for the colloidal gold influenza B test were 20.3%, 92.5%, 77.8%, and 47.7%, respectively, which were consistent with those reported in a meta-analysis by Chartrand et al.10. This meta-analysis included 159 studies and evaluated 26 rapid influenza tests, and found that the sensitivity and specificity of rapid tests was 62.3% (confidence interval [CI] 57.9–66.6%) and 98.2% (CI 97.5–98.7%), respectively. In addition, the overall sensitivity of these tests in adults was 53.9% (CI 47.9–59.8%); for influenza A and B, the sensitivity values were 64.6% (CI 59.0–70.1%) and 52.2% (CI 45.0–59.3%), respectively. This shows that the colloidal gold method alone is insufficient to discriminate between influenza and influenza-like disease. Studies have shown that the PPV range for a rapid influenza test kit is 30–80%11,12. Moreover, Eggers et al.13 reported that the sensitivity and NPV of a rapid influenza test were 40–50% and 55–56%, respectively.In this study, the proportion of patients who underwent routine blood tests, colloidal gold tests, and chest X-rays was 94%, 82%, and 16%, respectively. This shows that, at the early stages of the disease, routine blood tests and influenza colloidal gold tests are commonly used. In this study, influenza patients with a positive nucleic acid test result had a lower WBC count and neutrophil percentage than the patients with a negative nucleic acid test result, whose lymphocyte and monocyte percentage were higher, and these differences are statistically significant (P < 0.05). A WBC count < 9.075 × 109/L emerged as an important cutoff point. Among patients with a positive nucleic acid test result, 10% of patients had elevated WBC count and 28% had an elevated neutrophil count. It is plausible that some of the influenza patients included in this study had a concomitant bacterial infection.The decision tree model in our study found that the monocyte percentage range is relevant to rapid influenza diagnosis. Patients with a monocyte percentage within 10.95–12.55% were more likely to have influenza, whereas the PPV of this parameter decreased at a monocyte percentage >12.55%. This finding can be explained given the growing understanding of the immune function of monocytes. Monocytes are critical regulators of the innate systemic inflammatory response14, and their levels tend to be elevated in severe infections. Aegerter et al.15 reported that monocytes play an important role in influenza. Alveolar macrophages originate from monocytes and have antibacterial effects. Moreover, influenza viruses enter the cytoplasm through receptor-mediated endocytosis and promote monocytes/macrophages to secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 1 [IL-1], IL-4, IL-6, interferon-gamma, etc.) and to induce immune responses and phagocytosis in lymphocytes, while removing damaged or senescent cells. Therefore, monocytes play an important role in antiviral immunity.Nevertheless, monocyte count elevation has a complex function in influenza patients. A review of the contribution of lung macrophages and monocytes to influenza pathogenesis showed that lung macrophages have catabolic and immunosuppressive functions16. During the acute phase of inflammation, classical lung monocytes, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells have displayed proinflammatory function. Coates et al.17 reported that excessive inflammatory responses due to increased monocyte aggregation in the lungs of young mice cause severe influenza instead of increasing the capacity to control viral replication. This study delivered insights into severe influenza in adolescents, specifically, on the contribution of monocytes to secondary acute lung injury in children with influenza. Other studies worldwide have shown that monocytes/macrophages act as a repository, although certain viruses use these cells for productive replication18. Monocyte levels are frequently elevated in mycoplasma infection19, and monocytes play a crucial role in Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection20.Significantly elevated monocyte levels may represent atypical lymphocytes. In influenza patients, the immune response of lymphocytes induces T-lymphocyte activation, with the resultant production of atypical lymphocytes, which are larger and have large nuclei and loose chromatin. Instruments used for hematological analysis tend to recognize these atypical lymphocytes as monocytes, which results in a false increase in monocyte percentage. In future research, the manual verification of routine blood test results from patients with significant monocyte percentage elevation can be used to determine whether these additional monocytes are atypical lymphocytes. However, significant monocyte count elevation may suggest the presence of non-influenza infections, and in such circumstances, testing for other respiratory pathogens can be performed.In China’s primary care system, people with flu-like symptoms are routinely given blood routine examinations when they go to the clinic. Further pathogenic microorganisms tests depend on whether the primary care institution is equipped with relevant technology, as well as the patient’s willingness, payment method, and suggestion from the clinician. Patients attending primary care facilities often seek to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR), which generally results within 4–6 h, is ideal for influenza detection in primary care. However, the technology and conditions to carry out RT-PCR are usually not available in primary health care facilities. Some secondary and tertiary general hospitals in China can carry out RT-PCR detection. But due to the relatively complex technology, the actual detection efficiency is low, and the results need to be waited for 3–10 days. The CDC in some areas can offer free nucleic acid testing for influenza viruses, with a wait of 7–14 days for results. These conditions affected the timeliness of diagnosis, which could increase the likelihood of blind treatment with antibiotics. This phenomenon may be prevalent in primary care systems in the most underdeveloped regions of the world.In addition, the high cost limits the use of RT-PCR for influenza diagnosis in primary care settings in China. Through interviews with other hospitals in China and employees of pharmaceutical companies in China and the United States, the author has learned about the prices of colloidal gold and RT-PCR technology in China, the United States, and Europe. Viral nucleic acid testing in China costs about 300 to 700 Chinese Yuan (CNY), or about $46.6–108.7 USD. The cost is comparable to the ~$96–100 USD in the United States. In Europe, it’s about $194. But for Chinese patients with lower income levels, the burden of this cost may be greater. The colloidal gold method requires a simpler test that can be performed in a primary care setting, and results can be obtained in as little as 20 min. In China, this method is also much cheaper, priced at 119 CNY, or about $18.50 USD. It’s about 17–40% of the cost of RT-PCR. The cost for colloidal gold is $28–33 (28–34% of PCR) in the US, $73 (38% of PCR cost) in Europe.The limitations of this study include the small sample size and selection bias. The minimum age of patients that presented at our outpatient fever clinic was 16 years. Hence, in this study, >70% of patients were young adults; 50% of patients sought medical attention on day 1 of their disease course, and two-thirds had a moderate-grade fever (38–39 °C). The proportion of patients with underlying disease, pregnancy, or older age was low (7.4%). None of the participants had received vaccination against influenza.The decision tree analysis proposed in this study enables an easier understanding of the classification rules and presents a new influenza diagnosis approach. This approach improved the predictive performance of a single test, suggesting that it can guide antibiotic prescription in clinical practice. Of the 520 patients with influenza-like illness in this study, 105 (20%) had a negative colloidal gold test result and WBC count >9.0755 × 109/L. These patients were considered “non-influenza” cases, which may involve bacterial infection, for which antibiotics might be recommended. In contrast, patients with a positive colloidal gold test result and monocyte percentage within 10.95–12.55% were considered likely to have influenza. The PPV of these parameters was 89.9%, suggesting that 69 (13%) patients did not require antibiotic treatment. In this study sample (n = 520), there was an evidence-based rationale for antibiotic use after a simple and rapid test among one-third of the patients.Future prospective studies should test the feasibility of clinical use of the proposed decision tree model. In addition, studies that involve a larger sample size should be conducted to verify the diagnostic accuracy and stability of the model. For patients with negative nucleic acid test results, in whom the pathogen is unknown, high-throughput sequencing can be combined with differences in outcomes after treatment to determine the type of pathogen involved. However, further research is required to optimize the decision tree.MethodsAll study participants provided informed consent, and the study design was approved by the Peking University Third Hospital Medical Science Research Ethics Committee 2017 (295–02). All subjects were fully informed and signed written informed consent prior to take part in the study.This study prospectively enrolled patients who presented with fever at an outpatient clinic in Peking University Third Hospital during three influenza seasons (December 2017 to March 2018, December 2018 to March 2019, and December 2019 to January 2020). The inclusion criteria were as follows: fever ≥ 38 °C, cough, sore throat, and disease course of ≤3 days. This study excluded: (1) individuals who were mentally incapable or unable to understand the study requirements; (2) expected to have poor compliance; (3) pregnant or lactating women; and (4) other reasons that were considered inappropriate for participation in this study. As a national influenza surveillance outpost hospital, the mission was to collect nasopharyngeal swabs from 20 patients with influenza-like illness each week (ten patients on Mondays and Wednesdays, respectively). The study used data from this group of people. A total of 700 patients fulfilled the study eligibility criteria. We subsequently excluded 12 patients due to missing clinical data. Finally, 346 and 342 patients from the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 flu season, were selected, respectively, for study inclusion and provided a total study sample of 688 patients. However, 109 patients with body temperature < 38 °C and 59 patients with disease course of >3 days/unclear information in their medical records were excluded. The final analysis dataset included 520 patients. In the 2019–2020 influenza season, only 160 cases were collected within 2 months due to the coronavirus disease epidemic. Among these cases, four were excluded due to missing clinical data. Thus, 156 cases were included for the 2019–2020 influenza season.Laboratory methods and clinical dataNasopharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected and tested. The colloidal gold method was applied immunochromatography and a double-antibody sandwich to detect influenza A/B antigens by influenza A/B viral antigen detection kit (Guangzhou Wongfo Biotech Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, China). Preservative solution (80 µL) containing the dissolved sample was added to the well in the test card, and chromatography was performed after 15–20 min to detect the influenza antigens.The nucleic acid test was used for a definitive diagnosis of influenza. The specimens were delivered to the laboratory of Beijing Haidian District Center for Disease Control and Prevention following a standard institutional protocol used at the study center, which is a national sentinel surveillance hospital. The influenza A/B nucleic acid assay kit, H1N1 (2009) influenza A/seasonal influenza H3 nucleic acid assay kit and the Victoria/Yamagata (BV/BY) influenza B nucleic acid test kit (Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies Co., Ltd) were used and assayed for each sample on the ABI 7500fast real-time quantitative PCR system.Data on demographics (i.e., age and sex), clinical presentation (i.e., body temperature, °C; disease course, days; cough, sputum, dyspnea, runny nose, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, myalgia/arthralgia, fatigue, and chills) were collated. Medical history (i.e., underlying disease, pregnancy, contact history, influenza vaccination, and high-risk population), routine blood test results (i.e., white blood cell count × 109/L, hemoglobin g/L, platelet count × 1012/L, lymphocyte %, and monocyte %), and influenza colloidal gold test were included for analysis.Statistical analysisSPSS version 17.0 (Chicago: SPSS Inc.) was used for statistical analysis. Quantitative data are shown as mean and standard deviation, and qualitative data are presented as count and percentage. The t test or chi-square test was used for intergroup comparisons of positiveegative results of the nucleic acid test. The correlation between general clinical characteristics and nucleic acid test results was examined. Clinical characteristics were evaluated as independent variables, and CRT was used to construct a decision tree. The CRT method involves dividing the population into several homogeneous subpopulations with specific characteristics. Thus, the derived subgroups have a high degree of internal consistency and a similar degree of internal variation/impurity, which can be achieved by applying the prediction error minimization or a binary method21. The 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 influenza season data were used to establish the decision tree, while the 2019–2020 influenza season data were used for verification.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
