Avian influenza outbreaks have been reported globally since October 2021, causing significant impacts on animal health and welfare.
The disease primarily affects poultry and wild birds, but it can also be transmitted to mammals, including humans.
There is a growing concern that H5N1 avian influenza may become more adapted to mammals and potentially spill over to humans.
Mammals such as mink can act as mixing vessels for different influenza viruses, leading to the emergence of new, potentially harmful strains.
Studies are ongoing to understand the virulence and transmissibility of these viruses among mammals.
The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) is closely monitoring the situation and encouraging enhanced disease surveillance and strict biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of avian influenza.
