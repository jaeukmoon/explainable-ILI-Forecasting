Based on the in vitro cell-based assay, TPNT1 inhibited six major clades of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with effective concentration within the range to be used as food additives. TPNT1 was shown to block viral entry by inhibiting the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and to interfere with the syncytium formation. In addition, TPNT1 also effectively reduced the cytopathic effects induced by human (H1N1) and avian (H5N1) influenza viruses, including the wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant virus isolates. Together with previously demonstrated efficacy as antimicrobials, TPNT1 can block viral entry and inhibit or prevent viral infection to provide prophylactic effects against both SARS-CoV-2 and opportunistic infections.

The causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, has caused more than 42,512,186 infections and 1,147,301 deaths after spreading into 218 countries1. With the efficient spreading of SARS-CoV-2, it is becoming more difficult to contain the virus transmission. Many researchers have exerted great efforts to develop effective vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. One strategy is to re-purpose the existing broad-spectrum antiviral agents for COVID-19 therapeutics2,3,4. For example, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine at micromolar concentrations have been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 based on the in vitro assays. Remdesivir is even recently applied in compassionate use for patients with severe COVID-19 infection5.In contrast to the small molecules, we consider using metal nanoparticles as the prophylactic of COVID-19 infection. Metal nanoparticles may interact with virus surface glycoproteins and thus interfere with viral attachment and entry into host cells6. Metal nanoparticles may also exert antiviral activity by interaction with viral genomes7. Silver nanoparticle (Ag-NP), zinc oxide nanoparticle (ZnO-NP) and gold nanoparticle (Au-NP) are well-known antimicrobial agents against many kinds of bacteria, fungi and viruses7,8,9,10. Silver nanoparticles are antiviral agents against various types of viruses including hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and influenza virus, in addition to the antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholera and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A possible antimicrobial mechanism of Ag-NP is attributable to the suppression of respiratory enzymes and interference with DNA functions by the released Ag+ ions9. ZnO-NP can inhibit the growth and biofilm formation of MRSA, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. On exposure to UV-radiation, ZnO-NP further acts as a photocatalyst for generation of reactive oxygen species to damage viruses and bacteria11. A recent review highlights the role of Zn2+ ion in antiviral activity including inhibition of SARS-CoV RNA polymerase and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells12. Au-NP, generally used as a carrier in photodynamic therapy and biomedical applications, also shows potential use in suppressing HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis13, 14.In this study, we aimed to determine the antiviral activity of a metal nanoparticle composite, TPNT1, against SARS-CoV-2 and another respiratory pathogen, influenza virus, which also exhibit the potential to trigger a global outbreak in humans.ResultsIn this study, we formulated a metal nanoparticle composite, TPNT1 as the stock solution, which contains Au-NP (1 ppm), Ag-NP (5 ppm), ZnO-NP (60 ppm) and ClO2 (42.5 ppm) in aqueous solution with a positive zeta potential of + 32.81 mV. The individual metal nanoparticles were synthesized according to our patented method15. In brief, a metal aqueous solution (HAuCl4, AgNO3 or ZnCl2) was reduced by heating with citric acid at 150 °C for 12 min, and then dispersed in an appropriate medium to obtain the colloidal metal nanoparticles. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles were fully characterized by ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis and potentiometric titration (Fig. 1). According to the TEM imaging, Au-NP, Ag-NP and ZnO-NP are in spherical shape with 20–40, 10–40 and 25–35 nm diameters, respectively. The average sizes of colloidal Au-NP, Ag-NP and ZnO-NP are 78.1, 50.4 and 619.1 nm as shown individually by the DLS analysis. A colloidal solution of nanoparticle composite, namely TPNT1, containing 1 ppm Au-NP, 5 ppm Ag-NP, 60 ppm ZnO-NP and 42.5 ppm chlorine dioxide (ClO2) was prepared by well mixing of the above-described materials.Figure 1Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, UV–vis spectra and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses of metal nanoparticles. (a) Au-NP, (b) Ag-NP, and (c) ZnO-NP.Full size imageThe antiviral activity of TPNT1 against SARS-CoV-2 was first examined by plaque reduction assay. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2/NTU01/TWN/human/2020) in the presence of various concentrations of TPNT1. As shown in Fig. 2a, an obvious reduction of plaque numbers was observed in the presence of 100-fold diluted TPNT1 containing 0.01 ppm Au-NP, 0.05 ppm Ag-NP, 0.6 ppm ZnO-NP, and 0.425 ppm ClO2. The calculated IC50 for TPNT1 is 143 ± 15.5-fold dilution (Fig. 2b). The cell toxicity of TPNT1 was determined by the acid phosphatase (ACP) assay16 and the derived selectivity index (SI; CC50/IC50) was greater than 10 (Fig. 2b). The ability of TPNT1 to inhibit various SARS-CoV-2 strains was subsequently determined using 7 additional clinical isolates representing 6 major clades of SARS-CoV-2 viruses (Fig. 2c). The virus isolates used were summarized in Table 1. NTU01, NTU03, NTU06, NTU13, NTU14, NTU16, NTU18, and NTU27 represent A, B.1, B.2.2, A3, B.1.1, B.1.5, A.1, and B lineages of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Among the eight clinical isolates, three (NTU3, 14, and 16) contains the D614G mutation, which is circulating predominantly worldwide since March, 2020, and has been reported to exhibit increased viral infectivity17. As shown in Fig. 2d, TPNT1 could inhibit 93.5–100% of plaque formation by these SARS-CoV-2 strains. The ability of TPNT1 to inhibit virus replication was also examined using yield-reduction assay in a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line H1975 transduced with ACE2 (H1975-ACE2). The viral titers in the culture supernatants was determined by plaque assay. A significant inhibition of infectious virus titers in the culture supernatants was observed for all clinical isolates, including the D614G variants, in the presence of TPNT1 by plaque assay (Fig. 2e). TPNT1 can also inhibit the viral nucleoprotein (NP) expression in H1975-ACE2 cells infected by these SARS-CoV-2 strains (Fig. 2f).Figure 2The antiviral activities of TPNT1 against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

At least three independent experiments were performed and one representative result was shown. Full-length blots/gels of (f) were presented in Supplementary Fig. 1.Full size imageTable 1 Genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 isolates used in this study.Full size tableYield reduction assay was subsequently performed to determine the stage where TPNT1 might exert its effects by either pretreating the virus with TPNT1 (pretreat + infection), adding TPNT1 during (infection) or after virus infection (post-infection). The schematic illustration for experimental design was shown in Fig. 3a. The culture supernatants and cell lysates were harvested for subsequent analysis. The virus copy number in the culture supernatant was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Fig. 3b). The replication of virus in the infected cells was determined by quantification of intracellular viral mRNA and viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) expression using the qRT-PCR of oligo-dT amplified cDNA (Fig. 3c), western blot analysis (Fig. 3d), and immunofluorescence assay (Fig. 3e), respectively. Based on the experimental results, pre-incubation of diluted TPNT1 with SARS-CoV-2 is required for efficient inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. TPNT1 functioned at a stage before virus infection since the virus titers in the supernatants reduced significantly when TPNT1 was preincubated with virus before infection (Fig. 3b). Corresponding reduction of intracellular viral RNA and viral NP protein expression was only observed in cells infected with TPNT1-pretreated viruses (Fig. 3c–e).Figure 3Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry by TPNT1.

As shown in Fig. 4a, TPNT1 blocked spike protein from binding to ACE2-Fc-Biotin in a dose-dependent manner. Since syncytium formation is a step critical for virus entry after receptor binding, we also examined the ability of TPNT1 to inhibit syncytium formation. As shown in Fig. 4b, syncytium formation between 293 T/Spike/EGFP and H1975-ACE2 cells was inhibited significantly in the presence of TPNT1. The inhibition of syncytia formation was calculated by counting the 293 T/Spike/EGFP cells fused or unfused with H1975-ACE2 cells under an inverted fluorescence microscope. A significant reduction of syncytium formation was observed in the presence of TPNT1 as compared to the solvent (H2O) control (Fig. 4c).Figure 4Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry by TPNT1. (a) TPNT1 blocks binding of spike proteins to ACE2-Fc-Biotin; (b & c) TPNT1 inhibited syncytium formation between 293 T/Spike/EGFP and H1975-ACE2 cells.

P < 0.001***.Full size imageIn addition to SARS-CoV-2, we also tested the antiviral activities of TPNT1 against influenza virus infection in cell-based assays. Although there are currently four FDA-approved influenza antiviral drugs, peramivir, zanamivir, oseltamivir phosphate, and baloxavir marboxil, drug-resistant viruses have emerged and new therapeutics targeting drug-resistant viruses are needed18,19,20,21. In addition, the threat from avian influenza A virus to cause pandemics in human population cannot be ignored 22. Therefore, the antiviral activity of TPNT1 against seasonal influenza A (H1N1) and avian influenza A virus (H5N1) was determined by measuring the cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by virus infection. The inhibitory effects of TPNT1 was examined using three different virus inputs, 4,500, 10,000, and 20,000 TCID50/mL. As shown in Fig. 5a and c, TPNT1 effectively relieved the cells from virus-induced cytopathic effects, and a very modest reduced inhibition by TPNT1 was observed when the cells were infected with extremely high viral loads (20,000 TCID50/mL). The activities of TPNT1 against oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses were also examined (Fig. 5b and d). Similar inhibitory effects against wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant influenza viruses were observed, although a slightly reduced inhibition against oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses was noticed.Figure 5The antiviral activities of TPNT1 against influenza viruses in vitro. MDCK cells were incubated with (a) WSN (H1N1), (b) oseltamivir-resistant WSN (H1N1)(H274Y), (c) NIBRG14 (H5N1), and (d) oseltamivir-resistant NIBRG14 (H5N1)(H274Y) at various viral inputs in the presence of TPNT1. After 48 h at 35 °C, the virus-induced cytotoxicity was monitored. The cells incubated with virus only were defined as 0% while the cells with no virus inoculation were defined as 100% inhibition.Full size imageDiscussionThe person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets generated by sneezing and coughing, or contaminated fomites from the infected individuals has been shown to be the major transmission route for SARS-CoV-2. Besides efficient use of protective personal equipment, such as masks, as well as keeping social distance, implementation of a more active prevention strategy is required to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this study, we demonstrated the efficiency of a metal nanoparticle composite, TPNT1, as the prophylactic of COVID-19 infection. In addition, the anti-influenza activity of TPNT1 was also examined because influenza virus, known to infect millions of people annually and causing severe diseases, especially in the elderly23, shares the similar transmission routes, clinical presentations and seasonal coincidence with SARS-CoV-2. Based on the in vitro cell-based assay, TPNT1 was shown to efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 as well as human (H1N1) and avian (H5N1) influenza viruses, likely through blocking of the viral entry. Receptor binding represents a critical step for viral entry and subsequent virus replication in host cells. Interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the ACE2 receptor24, 25, and the hemagglutinin (HA) of avian and human influenza viruses with the 2,3-linked or 2,6-linked Neu5Ac receptor on host cells26 have been shown to be essential for virus infection. We demonstrated that TPNT1 can efficiently abrogate the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the ACE2 receptor on host cells, and to prevent the formation of syncytial cells. These data supports that TPNT1 can block viral entry and subsequently prevent viral infection to provide prophylactic effects against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.Metal nanoparticles with large surface area can conjugate modifiers to attain multivalent effect on targeting viruses. For example, the Au-NPs conjugated with multivalent sialic-acid-terminated glycerol dendrons can tightly bind influenza hemagglutinin, and thus interfere with the attachment of virus to host cell27. However, preparation of organic modifiers and encapsulation of nanoparticles usually require tremendous synthetic effort. In comparison, we used “naked” Au-NPs without bioconjugation, along with Ag-NPs, ZnO-NPs and ClO2, as an effective composite agent to inhibit the binding of viruses to host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virions, having average diameters of 80–120 nm, are in the size range of nanoparticles28, 29. As TPNT1 is most effective by pre-incubation with viruses, one possible mechanism for the antiviral activity of TPNT1 may be attributable to bindings of virus surface glycoproteins with the metal nanoparticles, and thus preventing the virions from attachment to host cells27, 30,31,32,33. Indeed, our experiments (Fig. 4) support that TPNT1 can block viral entry by inhibiting the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to ACE2 receptor and to interfere with the syncytium formation. It has been suggested that nanoparticles can diminish virus entry by direct interaction with the sulfur-bearing residues on the viral surface34. Based on the sequence analysis, SARS-CoV-2 spike has 40 cysteine residues while influenza hemagglutinin has 15 cysteine residues. Moreover, TPNT1 has positive surface charge (+ 32.81 mV) that may also enhance the binding with virions35. Inclusion of ClO2 as an oxidizing agent in TPNT1 nanometal composite is beneficial for virus inhibition. A previous report indicates that magnesium oxide nanoparticle (MgO-NP) impregnated with Cl2 exhibits higher bactericidal activity than free Cl2 or MgO-NP itself36. Another study shows that the combination of single-wall carbon nanotubes and NaOCl (or H2O2) also displays a synergistic sporicidal effect37. We assume that the ClO2 component in TPNT1 may render oxidative damage of virus surface, and thus provide enhanced effect for viral inhibition by the metal nanoparticles.Although metal nanoparticles have been demonstrated to have a wide range of biomedical applications38, the toxicity is an issue of concern. Most metal nanoparticles have beneficial and adverse dual effects. The degree of toxicity varies by the type, shape, size, purity, concentration, administration method and exposure time of metal nanoparticles. The current available data from many research teams are insufficient, and some are even contradictory, to determine the adverse effects of metal nanoparticles on human health39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48. As the information of toxicological studies including bio-distribution and metabolism of nanosized particles are insufficient, the safe doses of Au-NP, Ag-NP and ZnO-NP for humans are not yet established by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) or US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In this study, all the Au-NP, Ag-NP and ZnO-NP in TPNT1 are prepared in spherical form, and spherical metal nanoparticles are known to be non-toxic or less toxic than that in other shapes49, 50. Gold compounds have been used in medicine for decades and most studies on animal models support that AuNPs do not cause appreciable toxicity51. The previous studies showed that 0.1–2.0 mg/kg was a safe dose of Ag-NP for oral administration to mice and rats52. The recommended daily intake of zinc is 8–11 mg for adults, and ZnO-NP at low dose (100 mg/kg bwt/day) is beneficial53. The amounts of Au (< 0.01 ppm), Ag (< 0.05 ppm) and ZnO (< 0.6 ppm) in the 50% effective dose of TPNT1 tests are considered within the range of concentration to be used as food additives. The content of ClO2 (< 0.425 ppm) is also within the safety concentration in drinking water54, 55.In summary, we have shown that TPNT1 could effectively inhibit different strains of SARS-CoV-2 as well as human H1N1 and avian H5N1 influenza viruses, including the oseltamivir-resistant H274Y strains. Although we do not know its detailed anti-entry mechanism, TPNT1 indeed showed broad spectrum of antiviral activities against various SARS-CoV-2 strains and human/avian influenza viruses. Considering its prophylactic application, inorganic metal nanoparticles-based TPNT1 will have a relatively lower tendency to induce resistant viruses compared with therapeutic organic drugs. We believe TPNT1 can provide prophylactic effects against SARS-CoV-2 and opportunistic infections which are frequently observed in patients suffering SARS-CoV-2 infection by oral gargling, nasal spray, nebulized inhalation or even systemic use after an appropriate clinical trial.Materials and methodsGeneralAll the reagents were reagent grade and used as purchase without further purification.

The above-prepared Au-NP (0.5 mL of 100 ppm solution), Ag-NP (2.5 mL of 100 ppm solution), ZnO-NP (12 mL of 250 ppm solution), ClO2 (12.5 mL of 170 ppm solution) and ddH2O (22.5 mL) were mixed well to form a 50 mL colloidal solution of nanoparticle composite, namely TPNT1, containing 1 ppm Au-NP, 5 ppm Ag-NP, 60 ppm ZnO-NP and 42.5 ppm ClO2.Cells and SARS-CoV-2HEK293T, Vero E6, and MDCK cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies). The human lung adenocarcinoma cell line H1975 was generously provided by Prof. Chih-Hsin Yang (Graduate Institute of Oncology, Cancer Research Center, National Taiwan University) and was maintained in RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS. H1975 cells were transduced with lentivirus encoding full-length ACE2 before being used as target cells (H1975-ACE2). The expression of ACE2 in H1975-ACE2 cells was described in more details in another recently submitted manuscript by our group56. All adherent cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 20% O2. Sputum specimens obtained from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were propagated in Vero E6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 2 μg/mL tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Culture supernatant was harvested when CPE were seen in more than 70% of cells, and viral titers were determined by a plaque assay. The virus isolates used in the current study were summarized in Table 1. The experimental protocols were approved by the NTUH Research Ethics Committee (202002002RIND by Dr. Jann-Tay Wang), and the informed consent was obtained from all subjects.Antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2Plaque reduction assay was performed in triplicate in 24-well tissue culture plates. SARS-CoV-2 (100–200 plaque forming unit, pfu/well) was incubated with TPNT1 for 1 h at 37 °C before adding to the cell monolayer for another one hour. Subsequently, virus-TPNT1 mixtures were removed and the cell monolayer was washed once with PBS before covering with media containing 1% methylcellulose for 5–7 days. The cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde overnight. After removal of overlay media, the cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet and the plaques were counted. The percentage of inhibition was calculated as [1 − (VD/VC)] × 100%, where VD and VC refer to the virus titer in the presence and absence of the compound, respectively. ddH2O was used to prepare serial dilution of TPNT1 and was used as solvent control.For yield reduction assay, the virus (multiplicity of infection, M.O.I. = 0.01) was pretreated with TPNT1 and was added to the Vero E6 cells (pretreat + infection), or TPNT1 was added during (infection) or after virus infection (post-infection). To determine the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA, RNA from the culture supernatants and cell extracts of infected cells were extracted, respectively, and was determined by qRT-PCR of E gene using the iTaq Universal Probes One-Step RT-PCR Kit (172-5140, Bio-Rad, USA) and the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR software (version 7500SDS v1.5.1). Plasmid containing partial E fragment was used as the standards to calculate the amount of viral load (copies/μL). Total cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM sodium chloride, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 100 µM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, and 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate) for Western blotting. The primary antibodies used were anti-nucleoprotein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 (40143-R019, Sino biological, 1:5s000) and anti-PCNA (Millipore Corporation, 1:5000). The infected cells from yield reduction assay were fixed, and then probed with a rabbit monoclonal antibody against the NP of SARS-CoV 2 (1:200; 40103-R019, Sinobiological, China) and FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA). The nuclei were stained with DAPI. All of the experiments involving SARS-CoV-2 virus were performed in the Biosafety Level-3 Laboratory of National Taiwan University College of Medicine.Cell toxicity assayVero E6 cells were seeded to the 96-well culture plate at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells per well. Next day, each well was washed once with PBS before addition of DMEM containing 2% FBS and different concentrations of TPNT1. After 3 days of incubation at 37 °C, medium was removed and washed once with PBS. Then, buffer containing 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH = 5.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After that, 1 N NaOH was added to stop the reaction. The absorbance was determined by ELISA reader at a wavelength of 405 nm. The percentage of cell viability was calculated using the following formula: cell viability % = [(At/As) × 100]%, where At and As refer to the absorbance of a tested concentration and cell control, respectively. The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) was defined as the concentration reducing 50% of cell viability.ACE2-Fc-biotin and spike binding by ELISA assayThe construction of ACE2-Fc-Biotin and the ELISA was described by our group previously56. Briefly, the 1-674 A.A. of the SARS-CoV-2 spike with humanized codons were PCR-amplified and fused with the Fc region of human IgG1 at its C-terminus as the tag. The soluble recombinant proteins generated by the Expi293F system (A14527, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) were purified by Protein G Sepharose (Merck). The concentration and purity of recombinant proteins was determined by NanoDrop and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. The ELISA was established as described in our recently submitted manuscript. Briefly, 50 μL of 50 ng/mL purified 1-674 spike proteins were pre-coated onto the 96-well ELISA plate at 4 °C overnight. The plate was then washed three times with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20) before blocking with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.05% NaN3 and 5% sucrose in PBS) at room temperature for 30 min. The plate was washed three times with PBST, and the mixture of serially diluted ACE2-Fc-Biotin with or without TPNT1 was added to the 96-well plate for 1 h at 37 °C. After that, the plate was washed three time with PBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (1:500) at 37 °C for 30 min. After final wash with PBST, tetramethylbenzidine substrate (TMB) (T8665, Sigma) was added and incubated for 30 min before stopping the reaction by 50 µL of 1 N H2SO4. HRP activity was measured at 450 nm using ELISA plate reader (VERSAMAX).Syncytia formationThe syncytia formation assay was described by our group previously56. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmid 5 µg pCR3.1-Spike and 0.5 µg pLKO AS2-GFP by lipofetamine 3000 (ThermoFisher, L3000015) before being used as effector cells (293 T-S) after 72 h. H1975 cells were transduced with lentivirus encoding full length ACE2 and were used as target cells (H1975-ACE2). Equal amounts of H1975 and H1975-ACE2 cells (2 × 105 cells) were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FBS at 37 °C for 24 h. The 293 T-S cells were detached with 0.48 mM EDTA for 5 min, and the 293 T-S cells (1 × 105) were incubated with H2O or TPNT1 at 37 °C for 1 h. After that, the mixture of TPNT1 and effector cells was added to target cells and incubated at 37 °C for another 24 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. The 293 T/Spike/EGFP cells fused or unfused with H1975-ACE2 cells were counted under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica DMI 6000B fluorescence microscope). The percent inhibition of syncytia formation was calculated using the following formula:(100 − (H − L)/(E − L) × 100). H represents the total green fluorescent score in the individual picture. L represents the green fluorescent score in the negative control group with H1975-ACE2 replaced by H1975 as the target cells. E represents the green fluorescent score in each picture in TPNT1 group.Determination of anti-influenza activitiesThe reassortant viruses Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1), Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) (NA H274Y), Influenza NIBRG14 (H5N1), Influenza NIBRG14 (H5N1) (NA H274Y) were created using 12-plasmid system that is based on cotransfection of mammalian cells with 8 plasmids encoding virion sense RNA under the control of a human PolI promoter and 4 plasmids encoding mRNA encoding the RNP complex (PB1, PB2, PA, and nucleoprotein gene products) under the control of a PolII promoter57, 58. Except hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, all other genes for production of recombinant viruses were gene Influenza A/WSN/33. Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) (NA H274Y) were produced by incorporation of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from A/WSN/33 with a mutation of H274Y on neuraminidase to create Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) (NA H274Y). A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 (H5N1) (NA wt), Influenza NIBRG14 (H5N1) (NA H274Y) were produced by incorporation of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from A/Vietnam/1194/2004, with a mutation of H274Y on neuraminidase to create Influenza NIBRG14 (H5N1) (NA H274Y). The TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) was determined by incubation of serially diluted influenza virus in 100 μL solution with 100 μL of MDCK cells at 1 × 105 cells/mL in 96-well microplates. The infected cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 48–72 h and added to each well with 100 μL per well of CellTiter Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay reagent (Promega). After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, absorbance at 490 nm was read on a plate reader. Influenza virus TCID50 was determined using the Reed–Müench method59, 60. To test the anti-influenza activities of TPNT1, influenza virus at indicated titers was mixed with TPNT1 at various dilutions for 1 h at room temperature. The mixtures were used to infect MDCK cells at 1 × 105 cells/mL in 96 wells. After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2, the cytopathic effects were determined with CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay reagent (Promega). The experiments involving influenza viruses were performed in the Biosafety Level-2 Laboratory of Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica.Statistical analysisData were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). A two-tailed Student’s t-test was used for the comparison of continuous variables, and a P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant (P < 0.05*; P < 0.01**; P < 0.001***).

Sign up for Nature BriefingWill COVID-19 eventually become like the seasonal flu? | Penn State UniversityPenn StateWill COVID-19 eventually become like the seasonal flu?April 20, 2021Like influenza, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly mutating. Yet, the two viruses are very different. Influenza mutates rapidly, which is why vaccines need to be updated almost every year and why you need to get vaccinated every fall. In contrast, research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutates more slowly. So, what does this mean? As part of the “COVID-19 Vaccines: Asked & Answered” video series, Troy Sutton, assistant professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences, explains that because variants continue to emerge, we anticipate that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in humans for several years, causing regular outbreaks.

As the infectious cycle is initiated by the influenza glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), which mediates the binding of virions to terminal sialic acids moieties, HA is a tempting target of anti-influenza inhibitors. However, the complexity of the HA structure has prevented delineation of the structural characterization of the HA protein–ligand complex. Our computational strategy efficiently analyzed > 200,000 records of compounds held in the United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) database and identified potential HA inhibitors, by modeling the sialic acid (SA) receptor binding site (RBS) for the HA structure. Our modeling revealed that compound NSC85561 showed significant antiviral activity against the IAV H1N1 strain with EC50 values ranging from 2.31 to 2.53 µM and negligible cytotoxicity (CC50 > 700 µM). Using the NSC85561 compound as the template to generate 12 derivatives, robust bioassay results revealed the strongest antiviral efficacies with NSC47715 and NSC7223. Virtual screening clearly identified three SA receptor binding site inhibitors that were successfully validated in experimental data. Thus, our computational strategy has identified SA receptor binding site inhibitors against HA that show IAV-associated antiviral activity.

An estimated 56 million people worldwide were infected with influenza virus between October 1, 2019 and April 4, 2020, causing serious illness in 39 to 56 million and 62,000 deaths1. Influenza-related deaths most commonly occur in people aged 65 years and over in industrialized countries2, while among young children, a systematic review published in 2008 of the global burden of respiratory infections related to seasonal influenza among young children calculated that of all deaths in children aged younger than five years attributable to influenza-associated acute lower respiratory infections, 99% occurred in developing countries3. The effectiveness of seasonal vaccines intended to protect against infection frequently fail, because of influenza's genetic drift and reassortment ability4. Yearly vaccination is the primary means of preventing and controlling influenza5, but vaccine efficacy varies according to genetic relatedness among viruses in the vaccine and circulating strains6. Currently, three influenza antiviral drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for use against circulating influenza viruses; Rapivab (peramivir), Relenza (zanamivir), and Tamiflu (oseltamivir), all of which are neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors and interfere with the release of the progeny virion from infected host cells. This process prevents the infection of new host cells and halts infection spread in the respiratory tract7. However, despite the apparent treatment efficacy shown by these NA inhibitors, they have also been associated with drug resistance. In Japan, oseltamivir‐resistant H1N1 viruses were isolated from 7 of 43 patients (16%) in 2000/20018 and almost one-third (27%) of patients infected with H1N1 viruses between 2005 and 2007 exhibited resistance to oseltamivir in the UK9. We therefore sought to determine the feasibility of targeting the influenza virus glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) as a potential alternative therapeutic option to NA-mediated therapeutic strategies, capable of inhibiting influenza virus entry.HA plays a key role during the influenza A virus (IAV) life cycle, particularly in the attachment and penetration of influenza virus strains to host cell molecules10. No HA inhibitors are as yet available for clinical use, mainly because of the diversity of HAs created by antigenic drift and shift11,12. One report has suggested that glycosylations in the globular head of the HA is an essential step for viruses to gain virulence and antigenic properties13. Mature HA is a homotrimer, with a globular domain containing a RBS specific for SA expressed by host cell glycoproteins and glycolipids14. When the RBS of influenza binds to the host SA, the viruses can quickly enter the host cells. To prevent IAV from obtaining entry to the host cells, the RBS might be a potential target.The homotrimer is constructed by uncleaved HA0 subunits, which are unable to fuse the host membranes. By interrupting the correct folding of HAs in progeny influenza viruses, HA0 inhibitors elicit nonfunctional HA conformation and thus block viral entry15. For instance, the HA0 inhibitor AF4H1K1 blocks immature HA0 cleavage and inhibits the infectivity of IAV16. Another example is nafamostat, a serine protease inhibitor, which reduces cleavage of the precursor protein HA017. By folding into a jelly-roll motif of eight stranded antiparallel β-sheets with a shallow pocket at the distal tip, the HA1 subunit acts as an RBS surrounded by antigenic sites18. The antiviral mechanism of HA1 inhibitors is mainly attributed to their ability to block receptor binding and prevent the acquisition of a viral infection. An analysis of extracts from a traditional medicinal plant used in Borneo for treating symptoms of influenza infection has revealed that the useful substances were not limited to SA-like compounds, but also included non-SA-like components that might act against other viral proteins besides HA and NA19. Other research has shown that synthetic SA-mimic peptides have a high affinity to the RBS and thus block the initial infection20. Another study has described how multivalent 6′-sialyllactose-polyamidoamine (6SL–PAMAM) conjugates, which include a dendrimer scaffold against the SA receptor binding site, are capable of effectively inhibiting IAV infection21. Notably, recent research has detailed the isolation and characterization of 1428A33/1, 1428B5/1 and F3A1, human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target residues of the RBS of HA and neutralize A(H1N1)pdm09 escape mutant viruses that very occasionally escape from these mAbs22. The HA2 subunit mediates the host endosomal membrane's fusion with the viral membrane, allowing viral ribonucleoprotein entry into the host cell23. During the process of HA-mediated fusion, metastable HA2 subunits undergo irreversible rearrangement under acidic pH, which causes membrane fusion and the completion of viral entry15. The HA2 inhibitor Arbidol (umifenovir) interacts directly with HA2 and can prevent the acidification-induced conformation change of HA2, impeding fusion with endosome membranes24.After considering all HA subunits in the IAV structure, our study focused on the RBS of the HA1 subunit. We analyzed records of compounds held in the United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) database to identify potential inhibitors. Over 200,000 compounds were screened using the molecular docking method. Docked compounds were used to recognize interaction preferences by analyzing the RBS with interacting residues and specific physical–chemical properties. These models enabled us to identify inhibitors with novel scaffolds. Several HA inhibitors were identified and validated by a series of bioassays, including cell proliferation, plaque reduction, and hemagglutination inhibition. To refine our analysis and discover more compounds targeting HA1, we subjected the initial compound's derivatives to the same experimental tests, which revealed some attractive leads for potential HA1 inhibitors. Our study describes our use of a comprehensive framework for efficient screening of lead compounds for further drug design and development as HA1 inhibitors.ResultsA framework of anchor construction and post-screening analysisFigure 1 gives an overview of how we identified novel HA inhibitors by anchor construction and post-screening analysis. First, the structure of the RBS of the HA1 subunit (PDB ID: 1RUY)25 was selected as the target protein, and 208,023 NCI compounds were collected as the screening compound database (Fig. 1a). The molecular docking and post-screening analyses were performed by iGEMDOCK26 (Fig. 1b). Sialic acid served as the positive control and was docked into our prepared sialic acid RBS to validate our docking tool. SiMMap27 anchors were subsequently constructed from the SiMMap server (a site-moiety map for drug discovery and mechanisms server), based on the docking scores and the types of interactions between the 1,000 top-ranked compounds and the RBS (Fig. 1c). An anchor is composed of a binding pocket with corresponding interacting residues, moiety preference, and interaction type (E: electrostatic, H: hydrogen-bonding, or V: van der Waals forces). These 1,000 compounds were re-ranked based on the SiMMap score, and the top 20 compounds were selected as potential candidates (shown in Supplementary Table S1 online). Finally, nine compounds were purchased and evaluated by cell proliferation, plaque reduction, and hemagglutination inhibition assays in vitro (Fig. 1d). Figure 1 illustrates the process of how we conducted our research and validated our hypothesis.Figure 1Framework of the study. (a) Virtual screening for HA inhibitors using docking compounds from the NCI and the H1N1 hemagglutinin (PDB ID: 1RUY) was based on the iGEMDOCK program. (b) Post-screening analysis was conducted by generating the consensus interaction profile between the docked compounds and HA residues. (c) Anchors were constructed using the SiMMap to detect the most favorable binding pockets and moieties. (d) Validation of potential compounds was performed using three bioassays: The MTS assay evaluated the toxicities of the compounds; the plaque reduction assay quantified the antiviral activity of the compounds versus IAV; and the hemagglutination inhibition assay measured influenza-specific levels in type-O human serum.Full size imageAnchors of the receptor-binding siteThree pivotal anchors, E1, H1, and V1 (Fig. 2b), were generated by SiMMap in the RBS. Of all three anchors and their respective pockets, sulfonic acid and carboxylic acid moieties prefer to interact with R224, the basic residue that lies in the 220-loop of the E1 anchor. Notably, all compounds that have a nucleophilic tendency, including sulfonic acid and carboxylic acid moieties, have a binding affinity with the E1 anchor. The H1 anchor interacts with one acidic residue (D90), a small residue (G92), and one nucleophilic residue (T93) located in the 90-loop. The H1 anchor prefers to bind to amide, ketone, amine, and hydroxyl groups (with decreasing preferences indicated in this order). Lastly, the V1 anchor has a high tendency to bind to an aromatic and heterocyclic moiety, interacting with one amide residue (N91) and one basic residue (R224), as well as the E1 anchor. Our 3-dimensional (3-D) model is shown in Fig. 2a.Figure 2Receptor-binding site anchors obtained from SiMMap. (a) The RBS structure of the H1N1 HA (chain H of 1RUY) is depicted as a cartoon and three anchors as transparent spheres. Red E1 stands for the electrostatic force, green H1 for hydrogen bond force, and grey V1 for van der Waals forces. The corresponding binding pockets (residues) are shown in the cyan sticks. (b) The table presents binding pockets and moieties for each anchor. Each moiety of the anchor represents the functional group preference of the top-ranked compounds.Full size imageCompounds derived from NSC85561Supplementary Table S1 lists the nine compounds that were purchased according to the SiMMap scores. The compounds were subjected to bioassay examinations and safety analysis using the MTS method28 (a proliferation assay that uses the tetrazolium compound, MTS, in combination with an electron coupling reagent to produce a colorimetric change). Each compound was applied as 100 µM concentrations to epithelial Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to measure optical density (OD) values and toxic effects of the compounds (Fig. 3a). NSC97307 was excluded due to its low relative cell viability (below 0.75). When the cells were treated with 25 µM concentrations of each compound, identification of antiviral effects by plaque reduction assay revealed dramatic decreases from baseline in plaque-forming unit (PFU) values with NSC85561 and NSC84472 (mean PFUs of 5 ± 5% and 40 ± 20% versus control, respectively), identifying these compounds as effective inhibitors of the RBS (Fig. 3b and Table 1). Antiviral efficacy examination by HA assay began with concentrations of 100 µM for NSC85561 and NSC84472, followed by two-fold serial dilution. Whereas precipitation formed at 100 µM with NSC84472, precipitation did not occur with NSC85561 until the compound was diluted to 12.5 µM (Fig. 3c). Since the HA assay revealed much greater efficacy of NSC85561, we used this compound as a template to generate 12 further compounds based on the AtomPair fingerprints generated by RDKit29 Fingerprint in KNIME30. The AtomPair approach was used to generate 825 topological features31,32 for all of the compounds in our database, and these topological features were then used to measure the similarities between any two compounds by calculating the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC). Any compound with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 was considered to be a derivative of the active compound NSC85561. The 2-D and PCC values of NSC85561 and the 12 derivative compounds are shown in Supplementary Table S2.Figure 3Identification of NSC85561 from the initial compounds.

Figure 4a depicts the hierarchical clustering results of 13 compounds according to their interaction profiles. Patterns were similar for 6 of the compounds (from NSC85561 to NSC73413), with evidence of early clustering (Fig. 4a). The HA experiments subjected all 12 derivative compounds and the initial compound to the two-fold serial dilution process, starting with a 25 µM concentration. Precipitation with NSC4203 formed at 25 µM, whereas this phenomenon occurred at 12.5 µM and over for both NSC85561 and NSC73413, and at ≥ 6.25 µM for both NSC47715 and NSC7223 (Fig. 4b). To validate the efficacies of these five compounds, we used different concentrations of the antiviral plaque reduction assay. The MDCK cells were seeded in 6-well plates for 24 h, then incubated with the five compounds at 25 µM or 12.5 µM (Fig. 5a,b). At the concentration of 12.5 µM, the efficacies of NSC47715, NSC85561, and NSC7223 were much higher than those of NSC4203 and NSC73413. Figure 5c illustrates the bar plot of the relative cell viabilities of NSC85561, NSC47715, and NSC7223. Average values were 0.88 for NSC85561, 0.83 for NSC47715, and 0.83 for NSC7223 at a concentration of 100 µM. The compound concentration required to reduce cell viability by 50% (CC50) was used to evaluate the safety of the three compounds. CC50 values were 700 µM for NSC85561, 900 µM for NSC7223, and > 1000 µM for NSC47715. The half-maximal concentration (EC50) was used to measure the efficacy of the three compounds. MDCK cells infected with the virus (100 PFU) were mixed with NSC47715, NSC85561, and NSC7223, and subjected to the virus plaque reduction assay (Fig. 5d). Among these three compounds, NSC47715 exhibited the lowest values, so was the most efficient at the lowest concentration at inhibiting IAV. Selectivity Index (SI) values (the CC50:EC50 ratio) evaluated cytotoxicity and efficacy. SI values were 289 for NSC85561, 360 for NSC7223, and > 3,000 for NSC47715. The above results are summarized in Table 2.Figure 4Similar outcomes from the post-screening analysis and HA inhibition assay.

Based on the results of the time-of-addition assay, NSC47715 was as expected to block the virus binding to the cells. However, the virucidal effect obviously contribute to the anti-IAV activity of the NSC47715. The virucidal effect represents the activity by which the compound interacts with virus and consequently prevents the binding of viral particles to the cells. Though the docking strategy is based on the blockage of the interaction of HA and sialic acid receptor, the compound may interact with HA causing the instability of virus structure leading to the failure binding to the cells. Taken together, NSC47715 displayed anti-IAV activity by blockage of virus binding to cells (Fig. 6b).Figure 6Time-of-addition assay. (a) Schematic representation of the antiviral activity of NSC47715 compound in different entry stages. (b) MDCK cells were infected with H1N1 (A/WSN/1933) and treated with NSC47715 compound at the concentration of EC90(µM) at the indicated time according to the different strategy presented above. The values were presented as mean ± standard error of three independent experiments and were normalized to the values of DMSO solvent control. ***(p < 0.0001) shows there is a statistically different between NSC47715 and DMSO solvent control in the attachment stage.Full size imageDiscussionThe genetic diversity of IAV poses an ongoing threat to global public health and much research has concentrated on the evolution of IAV and sought to clarify the mechanisms caused by the rapid mutations of the virus and genetic reassortment of gene segments33. The animal-human interface has also aroused the attention of scientists34 and encouraged the development of rigorous clinical guidelines for the prevention and treatment of influenza35. Few US FDA-licensed anti-influenza A virus drugs are available for clinical despite use, massive screening for new agents against IAV. The NA inhibitor oseltamivir is the main agent for use against IAV, but pathogen mutations have conferred resistance to oseltamivir in influenza A(H7N9) viruses36,37. Thus, NA inhibitors have limited efficacy against seasonal influenza viruses and emphasize the need to develop alternative anti-IAV therapies. Due to its critical role in the early stage of IAV, HA is a potential target protein for anti-influenza agents38,39,40. The HA sequence structure has been extensively explored and roughly divided into two parts: the SA receptor binding site and the fusion domain25.In our study, the SA receptor binding site served as the target to block IAV infection, which differs from the recent research focusing on NA41,42,43. We first modeled the sialic acid RBS and built a compound dataset using NCI records. Using the process of molecule docking, we identified the top 1,000 compounds based on the iGEMDOCK energy values (Fig. 1a,b). To narrow down the list of compounds, we undertook post-virtual screening analysis on the SiMMap server to organize the orientation of the compounds and the HA residues, namely the anchors (Fig. 1c, Fig. 2). We examined the environment of anchors based on research published in 2019, in which the study researchers emphasized the vulnerable HA stalk trimer domain and depicted the conserved residues over various IAV strains44. They also found that FluA-20 (human antibody) tends to bind between the 220-loop and the 90-loop. Our models and predictions are consistent with their findings, so the anchors may play an essential role in interfering with the binding of IAV to the SA on the host cells.Next, we used a bioassay to validate our prediction and hypothesis (Fig. 1d). NSC85561 was initially identified and served as the template to generate the derivatives from our compound database (Fig. 3). Supplementary Table S2 lists the PCC values lying between NSC85561 and the 12 derivatives generated from the atom-pair program. The PCC values range from 0.83 to 0.98, indicating similarity in the structure of the derivatives and the atom arrangement to those of NSC85561.The interaction profile based on the post-screening analysis presents some intriguing outcomes (Fig. 4a). Although the patterns were similar for the six compounds from NSC85561 through to NSC73413, the anti-IAV efficacy of the HA assay was not as efficient with NSC87862 (Fig. 4b). Compared with the other five compounds, NSC87862 showed a lower binding affinity towards the side chain of the hydrogen-bonding force of N91 and the van der Waals force of Y102. Subsequently, the 2-D interaction diagrams of six compounds with the pocket environment were examined by the PROTEINS PLUS server45 (Fig. 7a–c and Fig. S1a–c), which revealed that all compounds except for NSC87862 had two naphthalene rings, which might explain their weak binding affinity. Moreover, the NSC4203 and NSC73413 naphthalene situated between residue T93 and G92 inhibits these compounds from fully binding with IAVs in that orientation, so NSC4203 and NSC73413 exhibit weak efficacy towards those IAVs (Fig. 7d–f and Fig. S1d-f). The RBS interface views of docked NSC47715, NSC85561 and NSC7223 is shown in Fig. 7g–i. Compared with NSC47715, the additional nitrite in NSC85561 and NSC7223 might interfere with their interaction with the HA binding site. As our investigations have shown, combining virtual screening and bioassay methods allows scientists to clearly and objectively identify novel SA binding site inhibitors.Figure 7Docked compounds show a high affinity towards the RBS of the HA.

PyMOL software was used to draw all of the 3-D figures55.Full size imageConclusionsOur research sheds light on the feasibility of virtual screening generating SiMMap scores for identifying lead anti-IAV compounds. NSC85561 initially showed the highest affinity to the RBS, according to bioassay results. After conducting the same experimental assays on 12 derivatives of NSC85561, we identified three compounds, NSC85561, NSC7223, and NSC47715, as strong potential inhibitors of HA. The SiMMap server enables efficient searching for desired compound functional groups and elucidates the connection between the RBS and compounds NSC85561, NSC7223, and NSC47715. Thus, our data support the use of virtual screening methods to easily identify potential anti-IAV inhibitors that appear to exhibit much greater antiviral efficacy than existing strategies.Methods and materialsDataset preparation and virtual screeningThe structure of H1N1 (PDB ID: 1RUY) was selected as the target protein for virtual screening from the Protein Data Bank46. H1N1 belongs to the H1 class from the 1930 swine influenza strain. Our preparation of the SA receptor binding site was as follows: Any residues located within 10 Å of the critical residues, K58, E70, S89, P140 and R22447, was selected as the SA receptor binding site/pocket in the 1RUY HA1 structure. To confirm whether or not our binding pocket is located in the conserved region of the HA1 subunit, the different hemagglutinin strains (all belonging to the H1N1 clade) were aligned using the multiple sequence alignment tool, Clustal Omega. The alignment results show that our prepared binding pocket is highly conserved in the HA1 subunit (Fig. S2). The 208,023 compounds employed for virtual screening were selected from the NCI database48 and were filtered out according to Lipinski’s Rule of Five. iGEMDOCK software26, a widely used docking program that provides accurate predictions, was used to dock the compounds into the RBS of the HA1 subunit. iGEMDOCK contains three types of interactions: electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding, and van der Waals forces. Based on the interactions (docking energy), which consist of a simple empirical scoring function and a pharmacophore-based scoring function, the top 1,000 compounds were selected.SiMMap construction and identification of hemagglutinin inhibitorsThe top 1000 compounds ranked by docking energy with their binding poses were submitted to the SiMMap server for reevaluation27. The SiMMap was used to analyze a protein binding site to identify anchors (antigenic sites), in often critical binding environments43. Moiety compositions between these compounds and the SiMMap anchors provide clues for lead optimization. Based on the protein-compound interaction profiles generated by the SiMMap, consensus interactions between compound moieties and binding sites composed of consensus interacting residues were identified. Next, a site-moiety map score was generated for each chosen compound. The identified compounds were reordered with the scores. Finally, potential HA1 inhibitors were selected for rigorous examination based on their ranking, feasibility, physicochemical properties and interaction types.Cells and virusesMDCK cells (ATCC accession no. NBL-2) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin (PS; Gibco) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Influenza virus H1N1 (A/WSN/33) cells were supplied by Taiwan’s Centers for Disease Control and cultured in an influenza medium (DMEM with 1% PS and 2 μg/mL L-1-tosylamide-2-phenyl chloromethyl ketone [TPCK, Sigma-Aldrich]-Trypsin from bovine pancreas [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA]) for growth. All viruses were stored at –80 °C. All virus-related experiments were conducted in a BSL2 laboratory.Cell proliferation assay (MTS)To test for cellular viability and cytotoxicity, we conducted a cell proliferation assay (MTS)49, a colorimetric method for sensitive quantification. Based on the reduction of MTS tetrazolium compound by viable cells, the MTS assay generates a colored formazan dye that can be quantified by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm. MDCK cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates overnight then mixed with our potential compounds in influenza medium for 72 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (PBS; Na2HPO4 8 mM, NaCl 137 mM, KCl 2.68 mM, KH2PO4 1.47 mM, adjusted to pH 7.2), after the previous medium was removed from the wells. We then added 10 μL of MTS solution and 90 μL DMEM to each well, and the cells were incubated for 30 min. Finally, absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using a microplate reader (SpectraMax iD3, Molecular Devices, USA). A blank control (influenza medium only) and cell controls (without compounds defined as 100% cell survival) were included in every assay plate. The mean optical density (OD, absorbance) of the three wells in the indicated groups was used to calculate the percentage of cell viability as follows: Percentage of cell viability = (Atreatment − Ablank)/(Acontrol − Ablank) × 100% (A: absorbance)50. The cytotoxic concentration required for the identified compounds to reduce cell viability by 50% (CC50) was determined.Plaque assayTo determine viral titers as plaque-forming units per mL (PFU/mL), we selected the plaque assay51,52, which is a standard method for virus quantification. In brief, MDCK cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates for 24 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2. A single layer of cells was infected with the indicated dose of IAV, followed by three washes with PBS. Next, the cells were covered with 0.3% agarose in the influenza medium for an additional two days at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and then stained with 1% crystal violet. Finally, the PFU was calculated.Plaque reduction assayTo quantify the antiviral activities of the compounds versus IAV, we conducted the virus plaque reduction assay. As described above, the previously seeded cellular monolayer (100 PFU/well) was incubated with or without the selected compounds. The virus suspension was removed following 1 h of IAV adsorption. The cells were immediately washed three times with PBS and overlaid with 0.3% agarose in the influenza medium, with or without the compounds, for 48 h. The EC50 values for all compounds were determined by comparing the number of plaques with those in the virus-infected control. The EC50 was defined as the half-maximal inhibitory concentration and the selectivity index (SI) was determined by the ratio of CC50/EC50.Time-of-addition assayThe time-of-addition (TOA) protocol determines how long the addition of a newly identified agent can be temporized before losing its antiviral ability during cell culture53. To understand the timing and stage at which the identified compounds inhibit IAV, the virus pretreatment protocol was divided into three stages (virucide, attachment, and penetration) to present the steps that virus may be blocked in the viral entry process54. The virucide stage: After hybridizing the drug and incubating the H1N1 (A/WSN/33) for an hour in a 6-well cell culture plate, we subjected the mixture to a 30-min rest at 4℃ before removing the mixture from the plate and subjecting it to incubation at 37℃, followed by the plaque reduction assay. In the attachment stage, the drug and virus were directly subjected to a 30-min rest at 4℃ in a cell culture plate, and then the mixture was removed, followed by the plaque reduction assay. In the penetration stage, the cell plate mixed with IAV was subjected to a 30-min rest at 4℃, then was added with the drug for another hour of incubation at 37℃, and then the mixture was removed, followed by the plaque reduction assay. This TOA approach is illustrated in Fig. 6.Hemagglutination inhibition assayWe used an erythrocyte agglutination test to determine whether SA bound to a compound and we examined whether the filtered compounds inhibited hemagglutination from causing a precipitation reaction in the SA binding and membrane fusion of HA. We diluted our compounds with PBS to 1:1,000. MDCK cells were diluted in a series of two-fold dilutions to achieve the IAV titer. To reduce the interference of the antibodies in erythrocytes, we prepared human type-O serum, which was diluted by two-fold serial dilutions in a 96-well microtiter plate.

(Photo Credit: Jane Lee) VIEW ORIGINAL FORT BENNING, GA – Martin Army Community Hospital’s Pediatric Respiratory Urgent Care Clinic (PRUCC) is no longer just for pediatrics. Starting Monday May 3, adults who are suffering from cold and flu symptoms can also walk-in and see a primary care provider at the newly minted Primary Cough & COVID Clinic (PC3). “The move to PC3 will allow for more in depth evaluation and treatment of adults,” said Pediatrician Maj. Jessica Aguilar. “It will provide ease of pharmacy resources and will be more semi-permanent in structure.” In addition to the one-stop shop for kids suffering cold and flu symptoms (testing, doctor visits and pharmacy), the PRUCC expanded drive-thru COVID testing to include adult dependents back in January. Shortly after, they opened the popular option up to active duty patients as well. But at the time, only children could walk-in and be seen inside the PRUCC, because only a pediatrician was on staff. The addition of an adult provider will finally allow PC3 to provide face to face adult urgent care visits as well. “The [pandemic] tent [in front of the main hospital] was providing face to face care for adults who had cough and cold symptoms, but it was always designed as a temporary solution,” explained Aguilar. “Now any patient who has symptoms of upper respiratory infections (cold, flu or COVID symptoms) or exposure to someone with COVID-19, can either self-refer to PC3 … or when trying to book an appointment via the call center should be directed to PC3 instead of booking an appointment in the clinics.” The pandemic tent will close on Friday April 23. After its closure, all non-emergent COVID testing (children, adults and active duty) will be done at PC3, building 3216 on Sandhill. Starting Monday May 3, both adults and children suffering cold, flu or COVID symptoms can also sit down with a provider at PC3. No appointments are necessary. The provider visits will remain on a first come, first serve basis. “If patients arrive at the hospital and endorse these symptoms either with the screeners at the door or in the respective clinics they will be evaluated to determine if they should instead be seen at PC3,” continued Aguilar. “We do not have near the resources the Emergency Department does. So anybody who feels they are seriously ill and need urgent or emergent care should seek care in the Emergency Room.” Aguilar said the convenient walk-in option at PC3 for both adults and children will start off with one adult provider and one pediatrician. But staffing will be evaluated on a regular basis.

In the fall of 1918, a pregnant woman named Naomi Ford visited the Philadelphia department store Strawbridge & Clothier to buy Christmas presents: two combs, a corset bag and an embroidered frame-style handbag. She never gave her loved ones those gifts. On that shopping day, Ford is believed to have contracted the deadly influenza that caused the 1918 flu pandemic, and she ultimately succumbed to the disease on Oct. 21. Her grieving family stored her gifts in the attic of their New Jersey house, where the presents remained for 94 years — the combs still boxed and wrapped in holly wrapping paper, and a “For Cousin Helen” tag left on the box containing the handbag. It wasn’t until 2012 that those items, plus one of Ford’s dresses, were taken out and donated to Drexel University’s Robert and Penny Fox Historic Costume Collection (FHCC). “We were initially interested in the items since they were from Strawbridge & Clothier,” said FHCC Director Clare Sauro. “However, when I asked the donor why they were never used, the heartbreaking story of Naomi Ford came forth and has been firmly attached ever since.” Ford’s never-given gifts are now teachable examples of the trends and fashion from that time period. They also exemplify the very real and very painful impact of the 1918 pandemic. Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of materials in Drexel’s archival collections that can tell similar stories about the 1918 pandemic. Drexel University (then called the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry) was around during the 1918 pandemic. So was the Academy of Natural Sciences. So were the Hahnemann Medical College of Philadelphia and Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania (which later combined and grew into Drexel’s College of Medicine). How were those institutions affected by the 1918 pandemic and what did they save from that era? The short answer: it’s hard to say. The long answer (the rest of this article): it’s hard to say, and here’s why. Those four institutions — and their current archival collections — are now united at Drexel. In addition to the FHCC, there’s The Drexel Collection, which holds the University’s art collection (in 1918, it still contained what is now the FHCC, which didn’t branch off until the 1950s as the Drexel Historic Costume Collection); Drexel University Archives, which preserves the University’s history; the Academy of Natural Sciences’ Academy Archives, which does the same for the Academy as well as its research scientists and their materials; and the Legacy Center Archives and Special Collections, which is the repository for the College of Medicine and its legacy institutions. Worth noting: there is also the Drexel Audio Archives, which holds the collection of recordings from the legendary Sigma Sound Studio, but those materials date from 1960–2000 … and no music was recorded about the 1918 pandemic. (There is, however, a recording of the Trammps’ 1970s song “Love Epidemic.”) All of those collections have very little related to the 1918 pandemic. It really is hard to say why, though — it’s not like people left records of why they didn’t leave records. Drexel’s current archivists can only guess why their predecessors did not preserve or collect material related to the pandemic. Maybe part of that reason is that institutional archives, like the Academy’s Archives, were focused internally, without much acknowledgement of outside impacts, as the Academy’s Brooke Dolan Archivist Jennifer Vess hypothesized. It could be reflective of a trend of the time, one that wasn’t swayed due to the pandemic; Legacy Center Archivist Matt Herbison has found little day-to-day practice-of-medicine records existing from Drexel’s predecessor medical institutions during the decades surrounding 1918. Or perhaps those institutional records were simply never collected — or, even, created in the first place. Plus, it could be that they were, but materials and objects related to the 1918 pandemic just aren’t easily searchable (and therefore, findable) currently within these Drexel collections. Unfortunately, embarking on an archival treasure hunt to find them (especially during a pandemic with limited on-site research availability) would be incredibly time-consuming and unpredictable. Here’s an example from University Archives archives technician Simon Ragovin: “Searching the Drexel University Archives’ internal database for keywords is only one step in locating potentially relevant material. Since archives are organized by collection, but not by subject, documents that provide important insights probably aren’t going to be found filed under ‘flu.’ Records from specific departments covering that time period are likely to include information about the impact of the 1918 pandemic on departments and individuals, and their responses to it. However, archival research is often time-consuming and can be very unpredictable, and so a researcher might spend a long time reading through boxes of papers and only find scraps of information.” So while there is very little to be found now, it doesn’t mean there is nothing. Some examples: Earlier this fall, DrexelNow published stories using first-hand accounts of life during the 1918 pandemic. The 1918–1922 Drexel yearbooks (from Drexel University Archives) contained quotes, references and even a skit that showed how the Drexel students remembered the influenza pandemic. Notes from board meetings and speeches (from the Legacy Center) preserved how medical faculty, staff and students of the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania (WMCP) recalled treating patients during the pandemic. When Vess looked up the proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences from 1918–1919, she found just one single mention of the flu. One department — the Biological and Microscopical Section — stated that it had held only six meetings in 1918, “a reduction of the usual number due to war regulations and the influenza epidemic.” During Alumni Weekend 2021, Drexel archivists will gather on a virtual panel, “Drexel’s Response to the 1918 Influenza Pandemic,” to discuss how their collections provide a glimpse of life during the 20th century pandemic. Today’s current archivists do not want history to repeat itself during this 21st century pandemic, and are taking steps to add to their collections and/or use the pandemic to work on their collections. Fox Historic Costume Collection To document the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fox Historic Costume Collection is collecting items (you can contact FHCC@drexel.edu if you have something you think fits the bill). Last term they acquired two homemade face masks from a Drexel professional staff member from the Westphal College of Media Arts & Design. Earlier this year, the FHCC held a crowd-sourced online exhibition — its first-ever online exhibition — called 2020: The Clothes We Wore and the Stories They Tell, featuring photographs of objects and masks with special meaning for members of the Drexel community and their pandemic experience. University President John Fry, for example, chose a tie he wore with his suit when working, because, as he said, “I wanted to reassure our colleagues with my physical presence on campus and the way in which I dressed was a purposeful choice to lend a sense of normalcy to these uncertain times.” Academy of Natural Sciences In May 2020, Vess authored an Academy of Natural Sciences blog post, “Documenting the Moment,” urging readers to create and save digital and written journal entries, photographs and social media posts related to their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. “As an archivist, my thoughts go to documentation,” she wrote. “How will the historians of future generations learn about not only the responses of government, but the impact on individual lives? What can we do now to record our stories in ways that might end up in archives?” Now, Academy Archives is working on plans to collect stories and possibly artifacts that reflect life one year into living with COVID-19. Already, at the beginning of the pandemic, a number of staff submitted photos and descriptions of how they were adapting to remote work, Vess said. University Archives In July 2020, University Archives launched its “Pandemic Stories” COVID-19 documentation project to encourage Drexel faculty, professional staff, students and alumni to donate a diverse array of materials representing what they have experienced during the pandemic. It’s also collecting internal notices and reports and external news media coverage related to the University and the COVID-19 pandemic. “This is a chance to write history while it’s happening,” University Archivist Matthew Lyons said in a Libraries story about the Pandemic Stories project. “In University Archives, we have received a bunch of questions about how Drexel responded to the influenza pandemic in 1918, and there’s surprisingly little documentation about that. We want to leave a better record this time.” As a “centerpiece” of that project, University Archives is planning an online audio exhibit for this summer featuring a series of oral history interviews about the COVID-19 pandemic. These interviews were conducted by Drexel students (as part of the “COVID-19” honors course offered by the Pennoni Honors College this past summer, which was taught by former History Department head and professor Scott Knowles, PhD) who asked members of the Drexel community, plus friends and family members, to share their experiences of this time. Additionally, University Archives has been saving all official announcements from the University related to the pandemic (such as those sent by Fry, the University's Return Oversight Committee and other administrative offices and University leaders) as email archives, and expanding its existing web archiving to include Drexel websites and articles related to COVID-19, such as the Drexel’s Response to Coronavirus website. The public can access all of those website archives (including pandemic-related pages) here, or search on library.drexel.edu (search for a keyword like “COVID-19,” and filter by “Material Type” on the left side of the page to select “Archived Websites”). The Legacy Center “From the ‘In Their Own Words’ DrexelNow story, we saw that the main ‘voice’ we have to tell the story of the 1918 pandemic is that of the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania, but two important things we don’t have in the Legacy Center records are (1) day-to-day details during the crisis and its aftermath and (2) the reactions and reflections of individuals living their lives during the pandemic. Today, we’re working to capture all three of these levels: institutional big-picture, institutional day-to-day, and individuals,” said Herbison. The Legacy Center is working to document Drexel’s public voice of the 2020 pandemic that doesn’t exist from the 1918 pandemic (which, being the 21st century, can be documented through websites and emails rather than the annual reports, ledger books and letters used exclusively a century ago). This captures what's available on Drexel's website and documents the information that Drexel wants to share externally and internally. In particular, Legacy Center staff are focusing their efforts on web-archiving: in April 2020, archivists began “webcrawling,” or browsing and indexing, various Drexel websites with COVID-related content, like the College of Medicine’s news page (now every day instead of every week) and the “Drexel’s Response to Coronavirus” page (every day), as well as Drexel’s Center for Hunger-Free Communities page with COVID-connected resource lists (increased from every three months to every day). The Legacy Center is also saving and preserving day-to-day information shared by the College of Medicine to its faculty, professional staff and student audiences, to be accessed in the future when they can be used without privacy risks. Later, when the pandemic is over or winding down, the Legacy Center hopes to capture the voice of individuals working directly with the COVID crisis, such as medical professionals and medical students in the College of Medicine. “We will want to capture their memories and experiences while it's still relatively fresh for people, but without crowding them or adding to workload of anxiety at a time of crisis,” said Herbison. “By holding off, we realize we're capturing a different kind of record — more of a reflection than a reaction, and that affects the granularity of the historical record. But for the day-to-day and individual-voice records, these are fine details that will be of huge interest to researchers. We know this because researchers using archives are so frequently looking for these personal details and want to understand the conversations and progress that led to certain institutional decisions.” The Drexel Collection The Drexel Collection (and thus the FHCC) doesn’t have anything related to the pandemic that was collected during or immediately after 1918, though it’s not known why. The curator during the pandemic, Elizabeth C. Niemann, left no documentation; she was the curator from 1914–1934. At this time, The Drexel Collection has not made plans to collect anything related to the pandemic, but does continue to collect materials within its collecting scope and has doubled the number of pieces from the Collection available online. Plans to expand the scope of the Collection to include more materials relevant to the community and underrepresented artists are in discussion. What You Can Do If you’re reading this DrexelNow story, then you’re likely part of the Drexel community and could contribute to this current important chapter of University history by creating, collecting and donating relevant materials to University Archives. You can see what other Dragons have shared in the FHCC's 2020: The Clothes We Wore and the Stories They Tell exhibit. And if you are a Drexel alumnus, you can sign up to see some of the archivists quoted in this story discuss the scope of their collections and their findings related to the 1918 pandemic (some of which can also be found in the above DrexelNow stories), during the University’s Alumni Weekend 2021, which will take place May 20–23, 2021. The panel, “Drexel’s Response to the 1918 Influenza Pandemic,” will take place on May 21 from 12–1 p.m. If you’re interested in reading in further detail what is known about the 1918 pandemic as remembered by those who lived through it and as documented in the University’s collections, you can read the DrexelNow articles about the faculty and students working on the frontlines from the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania and the stuents attending the then-Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry. Beyond that, you will likely remember this COVID-19 pandemic for the rest of your life. Consider documenting, saving and sharing your experiences from this historic time — you never know when that could be very useful in the upcoming years (or decades) for you, your family and/or future generations.

It was scientists at NIMR, including Wilson Smith and Sir Christopher Andrewes, who discovered the influenza virus. Dennis later recalled that he “had the honour of making the first vaccine and getting the first injection”.Dennis was born in north London, son of William Busby, a gas fitter, and his wife, Ellen (nee King). He left school aged 15 and joined the staff of the NIMR as a laboratory assistant. His initial role was washing glassware in the experimental pathology and bacteriology division. Within a year he was promoted and became technician to Smith.Dennis worked on research projects with Smith and with Andrewes. In 1941 he married Maureen Kingham. The couple had two daughters, Gillian and Phillipa. During the second world war he helped with mass production of the scrub typhus vaccine for the Ministry of Supply, for use among troops overseas. He was called up and in 1944 was serving in the Royal Navy when he was called back to London at the request of Andrewes and seconded to the Medical Research Council. “I received a draft chit to ‘HMS MRC’, with Andrewes as my Commanding Officer,” he later explained.After the war, Dennis gained seniority at NIMR and assumed more responsibility, including preparations for the move from Hampstead to Mill Hill in 1950. He and his family lived in the upper flat of the lodge gate house at Mill Hill. He became head technician in the bacteriology and virus division and in the 1960s was responsible for training lab technicians. In 1964 he wrote a guide to lab procedures, Virological Technique, in collaboration with two other experienced technicians.Dennis worked on the development and reorganisation of the animal facilities at Mill Hill in the 1970s and developed freeze-drying equipment for the storage of dried viruses. In the mid 70s, he took over the additional role of principal technician of the institute. He retired in 1979 and was awarded the MBE.Dennis and Maureen moved to Wisbech St Mary in Cambridgeshire, then moved to Horncastle in Lincolnshire before settling in 1994 in Ware, Hertfordshire. In retirement he spent a lot of time gardening and growing vegetables on his allotment.After Maureen died in 2006, Dennis did a parachute jump, aged 87, in aid of the hospice where Maureen spent her last days.Dennis and Maureen’s daughters predeceased him. He is survived by three grandchildren, Gillian, Christopher and Caroline, and nine great grandchildren.Explore more on these topicsMedical researchOther livesVaccines and immunisationobituariesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedWorldUS elections 2024UKClimate crisisUkraineEnvironmentScienceGlobal developmentFootballTechBusinessObituariesNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

(dcr)Iran breaks U.S. monopoly on recombinant flu vaccine - Tehran Times About us Membership Contact us Mon November 11, 2024 Home Society Economy Politics Sports Culture International Multimedia Tourism Iran breaks U.S. monopoly on recombinant flu vaccine Society April 20, 2021 - 19:15 TEHRAN – An Iranian knowledge-based company has acquired the technology to produce a recombinant human influenza vaccine, which was monopolized by the United States, IRNA reported on Tuesday."Recombinant influenza vaccines are produced using recombinant technology. This method does not require an egg-grown vaccine virus and does not use chicken eggs in the production process. Currently, the recombinant flu vaccine and the cell culture-based flu vaccine are the only egg-free flu vaccines licensed for use in the United States," Amir Hossein Abdolghaffari, CEO of a knowledge-based company active in the health sector stated. “As the second producer of recombinant seasonal influenza vaccine in the world, we were able to acquire the technical knowledge to develop the vaccine with the help of experts,” he highlighted. In previous years, the domestic need was 3 and 3.5 million doses, but due to coronavirus pandemic, the flu vaccine is needed more than before, he said, expressing hope that the vaccine to hit the market by September. In fact, due to the U.S. sanctions and import limitations, we often have problems in supplying vaccines. Relying on the previous knowledge of our technical team over the past 6 years, we started the production process of the recombinant influenza vaccine in December 2018. So far, the vaccine has been injected into about 430 people, which has had satisfactory results, he also said. At present, other flu vaccines cost 7 to 9 Euros to import, so that, 2 to 3 million doses of the vaccine costs us 18-27 million Euros, which with the domestic production, will be reduced to at least one third, he emphasized. According to IRNA, the first seasonal flu vaccine was unveiled on April 8. In addition, the vaccine is made in accordance with the standards of the World Health Organization, the Food and Drugs Administration, and the Ministry of Health. In October 2020, the Ministry of Health implemented a national plan to provide two million doses of influenza vaccines for at-risk groups such as the elderly, transplant patients, cardiopulmonary patients, and pregnant women to reduce COVID-19 effects. According to the national plan on influenza vaccination, up to 80,000 people who are supported by the welfare organization have received free vaccines.

Photos: Supplied/Pexels Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp The recent outbreak of a highly infectious strain of avian influenza in commercial layers on the East Rand have farmers panicked and consumers worried. The outbreak which led to about 300 chickens being culled and disposed of, also saw Botswana suspending the importation of poultry and poultry products coming from South Africa. More countries are expected to follow suit. READ: Avian influenza: Botswana bans Mzansi poultry imports According to Colin Steenhuisen, interim egg board general manager at the South African Poultry Association (SAPA), the local poultry industry has learned much in dealing with bird flu from the 2017 outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). “HPAI is not something we take lightly. However, there is no need for panic. Consumers need not fear products of poultry, provided the product – eggs or meat – are cooked properly,” says Steenhuisen. Poultry farmers are urged to be aware of various symptoms, including a swollen head, wattle and hock. Photo: Supplied/Food for Mzansi Poultry farmers and backyard flock owners are once again being urged to implement biosecurity measures to protect birds and help prevent any transfer of disease to humans. But what are the signs and symptoms of avian influenza, and how can farmers prevent outbreaks from spreading? Food For Mzansi spoke to Steenhuisen from SAPA to find out how armers can stop the disease from spreading, while safeguarding their animals. 1. Look for signs in your poultry Steenhuisen says it is important that farmers always be on the lookout for the signs of avian influenza in poultry. If your birds suddenly start dying, with others showing signs of a lack of coordination (cannot walk and stand), difficulty in breathing, depression and droopiness, they may have avian influenza. Other signs to look out for, he says, include swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles and hocks. A sudden fall in egg production, blood discharging from the nostrils and small blood spots under the skin (most visible on feet and legs) are also signs of the flu. 2. Protect your fowls and animals Apart from regularly cleaning areas where poultry are kept, keep birds that appear sick separate from the rest of the flock and other animals, says Steenhuisen. Nowadays, live bird markets are also a cause for concern as avian flu can flourish and spread in these spaces. A farmer busy disinfecting their shoes. Photo: GCIS/Flickr Avian flu can be transmitted between different species: poultry can pass it to other animals like pigs, cats and dogs. Therefore, it’s important to also keep chickens separated from other animals, including ducks. Ducks can become infected with avian flu without showing any symptoms, and then transmit it to chickens. Steenhuisen further advises that farmers take extra steps by protecting your supplies of water and feed. “They attract wild birds. Also keep your poultry away from water which may contain wild bird droppings,” he warns. 3. Keep your farm isolated Steenhuisen believes that proper biosecurity and hygiene practices are farmer’s best and first line of defence against avian flu. Lots of movement to and from you farm can be detrimental to biosecurity. Try to keep the number of visitors to your farm down to a minimum, he advises. Farmers tend to borrow equipment or vehicles from other farms – this is really a bad idea. However, Steenhuisen warns that it is better to keep all means of transport off your farm as far as possible. However, if transport or equipment must enter, he advises farmers to follow the correct protocols. For example, wash and disinfect all equipment, shoes and vehicles entering your farm before entering the premises. Remember, avian flu can enter your farm when you introduce new poultry or rough, infected droppings brought in from the outside by shoes, dirty cages and wheels. 4. Fowls sick or dead? Here’s what to do If your farm becomes infected, what you do next will help control the outbreak, protect people and allow normal production to resume on all farms in the area, especially your own. Avian Influenza detection taking place in a poultry house. Photo: GCIS/Flickr Steenhuisen says your first action should be to report any suspicions straight away. Sick or dead birds must be reported immediately to your veterinarian. It is quick actions that will help protect yours and other flocks in the area if the disease is confirmed. Also, do not leave dead animals lying around outside the chicken house. “Dispose of mortalities according to the prescribed guidelines. Leave disposal of bird carcasses to the veterinary authorities [or the local equivalent] and help only if they ask for it,” says Steenhuisen. Manure may also not be disposed of per the routine methods, he explains, so follow the approved protocols. 5. Traders should respect bans Commercial movement of infected poultry or poultry products is one of the main ways of spreading avian flu, Steenhuisen states. Traders who respect bans on the movement of poultry and poultry products help prevent the spread of avian flu and protect their own economic activity. Traders should only sell healthy birds and not risk trading poultry that look sick. It’s also advised to not sell birds of unknown origin – only trade birds that are certificated or are from a trusted source. A great trading practice is selling all animals at the same time and buying animals in one single batch. “Respect poultry movement bans as this will help control the disease and lead to lifting of the ban. Also, collaborate and co-operate with the veterinary authorities,” Steenhuisen says.

RUN won the pitch last year to develop a new brand identity and campaign with the Immunisation Advisory Centre (IMAC), who hold the Ministry of Health (MOH) contract to plan and implement the national influenza promotional campaign and programme. Since then they’ve been through a community consultation process with various groups, with the support of Hāpai te Hauora, Asian Family Services and healthcare professionals. Insights from this led to the campaign strategy of everyone treating their whānau like the taonga (treasure) they are in a reciprocal way. The campaign features real people, painted in a classic portraiture style, to visually articulate that they are a taonga to their whānau, merged with modern design to capture the audience. Each portrait is being gifted to the person painted, for them and their whānau to keep as a taonga, to display proudly in their home. Says Raymond McKay, CD at RUN: “With this campaign we needed to draw upon all of our cultural experience within the agency to create something meaningful, that really focused on real people. Our collaboration and approach needed to be less agency and more tīkanga, which we relish.” Says Barbara McArdle, national influenza coordinator at IMAC: “We gave RUN a challenging brief, and we’re really happy with the outcome. They have been open minded, flexible and able to adapt rapidly to changes, while continuing to provide the necessary design and communication we needed for this important national campaign.” Māori kaumātua aged 65+ are the primary audience for this years’ campaign, followed by the older Asian community, with the capability to easily adapt it for different audiences in future years.
