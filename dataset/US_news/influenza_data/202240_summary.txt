Vaccine Importance and Coverage: The importance of flu vaccination is highlighted, with emphasis on getting up to date on routine immunizations. The coverage rate for the flu vaccine remains at around 51%, with concerning decreases in coverage among children, pregnant individuals, and adults with chronic health conditions. Racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination rates persist.
Preferential Recommendation for Older Adults: For the 2022-2023 flu season, three flu vaccines are preferentially recommended for individuals aged 65 and older. These vaccines are potentially more effective in this age group compared to standard dose unadjuvanted flu vaccines.
Importance of Flu and Pneumococcal Vaccination: Despite the attention given to COVID-19 vaccines, experts emphasize the ongoing importance of flu and pneumococcal vaccination. Both vaccines have been shown to reduce illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths.
Timing of Vaccinations: Public reminded that flu and COVID-19 vaccines can be given in the same visit if the timing aligns.
Public Health Threat of Flu: The threat of flu as a public health concern is emphasized, and annual flu vaccination is deemed a critical tool in preventing flu and its potential serious outcomes.
Digital Campaigns to Promote Vaccination: CDC has launched a digital campaign called "Help Them Fight Flu" to encourage parents to vaccinate their young children against the flu. Collaboration with organizations such as the AMA and the Ad Council aims to raise awareness about flu vaccination, with a particular focus on Black and Hispanic audiences.
