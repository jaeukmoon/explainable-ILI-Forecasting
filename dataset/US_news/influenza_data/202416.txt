Learn more about the different flu vaccines available and where to find flu vaccines. Overview ACIP Recommendations‎ Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — United States, 2024-2025 Influenza Season has been published. Recommendations Influenza (flu) vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the influenza viruses that are used to make vaccine. The seasonal flu vaccine protects against the influenza viruses that research suggests will be most common during the upcoming season. These include three different main groups of influenza Type A and B viruses. Below are links to more information about the different type of flu vaccines available. Flu shot Flu shots are vaccines given with a needle, usually in the arm.

Concomitant with the spread of HPAI viruses in birds are increasing numbers of mammalian infections, including wild and captive mesocarnivores and carnivores with central nervous system involvement. Here we report HPAI, A(H5N1) of clade 2.3.4.4b, in a common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) from Florida, United States. Pathological findings include neuronal necrosis and inflammation of the brain and meninges, and quantitative real time RT-PCR reveal the brain carried the highest viral load. Virus isolated from the brain contains a S246N neuraminidase substitution which leads to reduced inhibition by neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir. The increased prevalence of A(H5N1) viruses in atypical avian hosts and its cross-species transmission into mammalian species highlights the public health importance of continued disease surveillance and biosecurity protocols.

These viruses have raised concern due to their significant adverse economic impacts on the poultry industry and widespread mortality in wild bird species1. Notably, the virus has also been detected in a number of raptors such as eagles, owls, and vultures, suggesting predation and scavenging of infected birds are efficient means of HPAI virus transmission1,2,4.Recently, clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) viruses have been responsible for mortalities in sea lions (Otaria flavescents) in Peru and Chile, along with harbor (Phoca vitulina) and gray (Halichoerus grypus) seals in New England and Canada5,6,7. Historically, multiple unusual mortality events in seal populations have been associated with avian influenza. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) appear to be the most susceptible marine mammal species for developing fatal respiratory disease, although the reason for this is currently unknown8,9. Many of these previous seal influenza-related mortality events that occurred in New England seal populations were caused by different influenza subtypes including A(H7N7) in 1979, A(H4N5) in 1983, A(H4N6) in 1991, A(H3N3) in 1992, and A(H3N8) in 201110,11,12,13,14. Other significant outbreaks in seals have occurred in European waters (including A(H10N7) in 2014)8,15,16,17.In contrast to pinniped species, avian influenza viruses have rarely been detected in cetaceans and have not been associated with any unusual mortality events. Avian influenza viruses have been isolated from cetaceans including baleen whales (family Balaenopteridae)13,18 such as the common minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata)19, as well as pilot whales (Globicephala melaena)13,20,21, Dall’s porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli)19, and belugas (Delphinapterus leucas)13,22.The recent spread of clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) viruses has been accompanied by novel infections of cetacean species around the world including three common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in Peru, Wales, and England, two harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in Sweden and England, and an Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus) in Canada6,23. In the harbor porpoise from Sweden, influenza virus was predominately found within the brain causing meningoencephalitis, consistent with this current report and other recent detections in terrestrial mammals23. The harbor porpoise displayed neurological signs including circling, inability to right itself, and subsequent drowning23.Similarly, spillover of clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) in terrestrial mammals has also shown viral infection predominately in the brain, along with associated neurological signs. In 2006, a stone marten (Martes foina) naturally infected with a HPAI A(H5N1) virus developed neurological symptoms due to encephalitis, likely secondary to consumption of an infected wild waterfowl24. Other wild carnivore species have been diagnosed with HPAI A(H5N1), including a study of wild terrestrial mammals in the United States showing that 53 of 57 HPAI A(H5N1) virus-infected animals displayed neurological abnormalities25.Here we report an infection of HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b in a common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in Florida, United States, with the highest viral load in the brain causing meningoencephalitis. Adding to the existing literature on A(H5N1) viruses in cetacean species, the availability of tissues and multiple samples from this animal allowed us to combine a pathologic and virologic evaluation of the infection. Research was conducted to confirm the presence of A(H5N1) virus in dolphin tissues, biologically characterize the virus, and to determine the phylogenetic relationship between viruses from the dolphin and local wild bird populations. This study highlights the importance of combining histological lesions with virus isolation in order to better understand HPAI A(H5N1).ResultsStranding responseOn 29 March 2022, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s Marine Mammal Pathobiology Laboratory (FWC MMPL) notified the University of Florida Marine Animal Rescue Program (UF MAR) of a dolphin in distress in a canal north of 178 4th Ave. West Horseshoe Beach in Dixie County, FL 32648 (29.44222°N, -83.29004°W). The complainant stated that the live dolphin was located between a seawall and dock piling, measuring approximately 20 centimeters wide, in the canal behind their home. The complainant attempted to free the dolphin while providing supportive care, however, the dolphin passed shortly after discovery and prior to the arrival of UF MAR. The dolphin was packed in ice and transported to the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine (UF CVM) on 29 March 2022 to be stored in a cooler for necropsy the following day.Gross and microscopic postmortem examinationAt the UF CVM on 30 March 2022, the lungs were inflated and a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, followed by a postmortem examination. The 191 cm juvenile, male common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus; UFTt2203) was in thin body condition. Gross findings included an empty gastrointestinal tract, numerous superficial and deep linear epidermal lacerations, severe erosion of the caudal pharyngeal mucosa at the base of the larynx, mild pulmonary nematodiasis, lymphadenomegaly, and soft tissue proliferation at the tip of the penis.On microscopic examination, the most prominent finding was moderate to marked mononuclear (dominated by lymphocytes and histiocytes) inflammation of the brain (Fig. 1a, b) and leptomeninges (Fig. 1c) with neuronal necrosis and neuropil malacia (Fig. 1b). The changes were the most predominant in the diencephalon, but also present within the mesencephalon and the brainstem. Meningeal and parenchymal vessels were frequently cuffed by mononuclear cells and there were multifocal areas of acute hemorrhage (Fig. 1a). Multifocal foci of mild gliosis were also present in the mesencephalon. These microscopic findings are all more suggestive of a longer, subacute, infection of the brain. The only observed pulmonary changes included multifocal, mild, chronic granulomas and emphysematous change presumably secondary to postmortem insufflation (Fig. 1d). No viral inclusions or syncytial cells were noted in any examined tissues. No microorganisms were visualized in brain sections with histochemical stains (Gomori-methenamine silver or periodic acid-Schiff). Other microscopic findings unrelated to the central nervous system lesions included a squamous penile papilloma, verminous laryngitis with intralesional nematodes, gastric trematodes, and generalized reactive lymphoid hyperplasia.Fig. 1: Microscopic features of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in a common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus).a In the brain, the cerebral neuroparenchyma is hypercellular with areas of congestion, hemorrhage, and loose, mononuclear perivascular cuffs; bar = 500 µm. b Within the affected neuropil, there is frequent necrosis of neurons and glial cells, as characterized by cytoplasmic eosinophilia and nuclear fragmentation; bar = 50 µm. c The leptomeninges are expanded by mixed mononuclear cells and hemorrhage; bar = 250 µm. d The pulmonary parenchyma was largely unremarkable, changes consistent with mild postmortem autolysis; bar = 250 µm. Hematoxylin and eosin, all panels.Full size imageAncillary diagnosticsSamples of the affected brain were screened for the presence of apicomplexan parasites (such as Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis spp.) and cetacean morbillivirus by PCR and RT-PCR, respectively, at the UF CVM Zoological Medicine Diagnostic Laboratory; both tests were negative. Lung and brain tissue samples were subsequently sent to the Bronson Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (a member of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, accredited for testing for Select Agents) to screen for HPAI viruses and eastern equine encephalitis virus. HPAI virus was detected in both the lung and brain, with the brain having a higher viral load (Table 1). No other viruses were detected. Tissue samples were then sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) for official confirmatory testing (Table 1). Real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays were then used to test for influenza A virus of Eurasian A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (H5N1) lineage. The sequence of HA cleavage site, along with sequencing of NA gene, were used to characterize the virus subtype and pathotype. The virus was confirmed as HPAI A(H5N1) virus of HA clade 2.3.4.4b.Table 1 Viral load in the lungs and brain of dolphinFull size tableTissue distribution of H5N1 viral RNADolphin tissues collected prior to confirmation of the presence of HPAI A(H5N1) virus were transferred to an approved Biosafety Level 3 enhanced (BSL3-enhanced) laboratory at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN. Real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) was used to detect the presence of H5 virus in selected tissues using influenza A virus matrix (M)- and H5 gene-specific primers. Brain and spinal cord homogenates were positive for influenza virus with CT values of <30 when probed for both M and H5 RNA. Tissue from the brain had the highest concentration of viral RNA with a M gene CT value of 15.7 and H5 CT value of 23.6. Influenza virus RNA was less prevalent in the lung with a CT value of 32.5 when H5 primers were used. Interestingly, gastric samples had a M gene CT value of 28.9 and H5 was detected with a CT value of 34.2. Trace M gene RNA was also detected in liver and kidney samples (CT > 34), suggesting low-level systemic dissemination of the virus (Table 2).Table 2 Viral load in the selected tissues of dolphinFull size tableImmunohistochemistryTo further evaluate the tissue sites for presence of HPAI A(H5N1) viral RNA in the dolphin, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on lung and brain tissues. IHC revealed viral antigen present in perivascular neurons and neuropil throughout the central nervous system (CNS; Fig. 2a). In situ hybridization (ISH) confirmed these results. As expected, viral RNA was localized in the same areas of the CNS as was viral antigen (Fig. 2b). At higher magnification, IHC and ISH detected viral antigen and RNA in the neuronal soma and axonal processes (Fig. 2c, d). However, when lung sections were stained, weak IHC labeling was present in some alveolar surfaces and within the pulmonary interstitium; these sections of lung were negative for viral RNA by ISH suggesting that virus infection was not present in the lung (Fig. 2e, f). Additionally, sporadic virus positive cells were detected in circulation, as well as the heart and lung, suggesting low grade viremia. These sporadic viral positive cells could not be definitively identified due to their indistinct morphology, and the significance at this time is unknown. Multiple levels of the gastrointestinal tract (forestomach, pyloric stomach, glandular stomach, proximal small intestine, middle small intestine, and colon) were also evaluated for the presence of influenza virus nucleoprotein by IHC. No definitive positive cells were detected in the intestinal mucosal. Gastrointestinal myenteric plexi were present and evaluated at all levels; they were all negative for virus antigen. Overall, the widespread presence of A(H5N1) virus antigen in the CNS and the absence of detection in the respiratory tissues, as well as systemic diffuse virus positive cells, by IHC and ISH are consistent with the rRT-PCR results.Fig. 2: Detection of influenza A(H5N1) virus antigen and virus RNA in dolphin tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) in the brain and lung.a Numerous antigen-positive foci in perivascular neurons and neuropil throughout the CNS by IHC. b Localization of influenza virus RNA in the same areas of CNS by ISH in sequential sections. c Higher magnification showing virus antigen in the neuronal soma and axonal processes by IHC. d Localization of virus RNA in the same cellular locations by ISH.

No isolates were grown from the lung tissue, even after multiple blind passages in either embryonated chicken eggs or MDCK cells.Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysisSequence analysis of the full genome of A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) virus was obtained directly from the brain homogenate as well as from virus isolated in embryonated chicken eggs and MDCK cells inoculated with homogenates from the dolphin brain. The genomic sequences from all sources were identical at the amino acid level. Sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers OP698125-OP698132. As expected, all eight gene segments of A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) virus clustered with viruses isolated from birds and wild mammals in North America (data for HA shown in Fig. 3). The virus was identified as a genotype B1.2 reassortant with polymerase basic 2 (PB2; clustered with am1.1), polymerase basic 1 (PB1; clustered with am1.1), polymerase acidic (PA; clustered with am1), and nucleoprotein (NP; clustered with am1.2) genes derived from North American lineages with the remaining genes of Eurasian lineage origin (clustered with ea1) (Fig. S1). All gene segments had at least 99% identity to those derived from other viruses detected across North America and determined to be genotype B1.2 which circulated along the Atlantic and Mississippi flyways during the spring of 2022 with steady detections even into the Central flyway but did not reach the Pacific flyway. Notably, we also sequenced the genomes of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses isolated from deceased birds including from lesser scaup (Aythya affinis), common loon (Gavia immer) and a laughing gull (Leucophaeus atricilla) from the same geographic area (Dixie County, Florida) and approximate same time frame (March 2022). This coincided with outbreaks infecting local wild bird species. The genotypes of these viruses differed from the genotype of the dolphin virus suggesting that they were not direct precursors. Similarly, viruses isolated from an A(H5N1) outbreak in seals in the Northeast United States were unreassorted genotype A2 and not related to the dolphin isolate ruling out these animals as a source of infection.Fig. 3: Phylogenetic alignment of influenza A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) HA gene sequences with Eurasian and North American lineage viruses.Phylogenetic tree representing HA segments primarily from viruses collected from North American birds inferred using neighbor joining methods displayed with all 8 gene segment origins. The HA from the virus identified in the bottlenose dolphin is represented by the blue square while the green circles indicate the most similar sequences identified which differ by three nucleotides. Gene segments originating from North American viruses are represented in green, Eurasian origin gene segments are colored blue, and white indicates no data available.Full size imageSequence data was examined for presence of markers associated with mammalian adaptation. Only an HA-T192I (H3 numbering) amino acid substitution in the 190-helix situated adjacent to the receptor binding site was identified, which has been shown to increase receptor α2,6-sialic acid binding26. The impact of this substitution on sialic acid specificity is unknown in this A(H5N1) genetic backbone. Additionally, NA-S246N (N2 numbering), a substitution associated with reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) oseltamivir, was present in A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) virus. No markers associated with resistance to adamantanes or endonuclease inhibitors were identified27,28. Similarly, PB2 substitutions that are often associated with mammalian infection of avian influenza viruses were absent29.Antiviral susceptibilityDue to the NA-S246N substitution, A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) virus was evaluated for susceptibility to NAIs. Oseltamivir susceptibility of A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) virus was 18-fold lower than for N1-subtype matched oseltamivir susceptible reference virus A/Denmark/524/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, with IC50 values of 7.51 nM vs. 0.41 nM respectively (Fig. 4a, c). A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 and reference virus A/Denmark/524/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 had similar IC50 values for zanamivir (0.52 nM vs. 0.31 nM, respectively) and peramivir (0.72 nM vs. 0.10 nM, respectively) (Fig. 4a, c). For reference, A/Denmark/528/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 containing NA-H274Y (N2 numbering) was also evaluated and displayed highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir with IC50 values of 155.0 nM and 23.5 nM, respectively (Fig. 4b). Therefore, A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) containing NA-S246N displayed reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir at the low end of the inhibition scale as classified by World Health Organization (WHO) guidance for NAI susceptibility reporting. The virus retained full susceptibility to peramivir and zanamivir.Fig. 4: NAI susceptibility of A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) virus.a NAI susceptibility of A/Denmark/524/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 NA-H274 (N2 numbering) wild-type reference virus. b NAI susceptibility of A/Denmark/528/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 NA-H274Y oseltamivir/peramivir-resistant reference virus. c NAI susceptibility of A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (Dolphin/FL) virus. Classifications follow WHO guidance for NAI susceptibility evaluation.Full size imageReceptor binding propertiesDue to the HA-T192I substitution (H3 numbering) that was unique in A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) virus and supposed to be in the 190-helix situated adjacent to the receptor binding pocket, receptor binding assay was examined. The current H5N1 isolate preferred to bind sialic acid receptors with a 3′SLN-linked sialic acid (avian influenza viruses’ receptors), rather than 6′SLN-linked sialic acid receptors (human influenza viruses’ receptors) (Fig. 5).Fig. 5: Receptor-affinity assay of the A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) virus.Direct binding of the virus to sialylglycopolymers (3’-SLN or 6’-SLN) at different concentrations (X axis) was measured at optical density (O.D.) of 490 nm (Y axis). A/bald eagle/Florida/W22-134/2022 (H5N1) and A/Memphis/257/2019 (H3N2) were included as control viruses.Full size imageAntigenic characterizationTo examine the antigenic properties of A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) virus, hemagglutination inhibition assays were conducted with reference viruses and antisera. A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) virus was antigenically indistinguishable from other 2021/2022 clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) viruses collected in North America. They reacted well with post-infection ferret antiserum generated against A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 (H5N1), the WHO’s reference virus for this clade.DiscussionThis report represents the first known detection and isolation of influenza A virus from a common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), found deceased on 29 March 2022. Prior to necropsy and microscopic evaluation, influenza was not considered as a differential diagnosis for this stranded bottlenose dolphin. However, the discovery of meningoencephalitis on microscopic evaluation led us to consider neuroinvasive etiologies previously diagnosed in other Florida wildlife. HPAI virus was considered as a potential etiology because HPAI (H5N1) virus-infected wild birds commonly have encephalitis on postmortem examinations30, and in conjunction, there had been numerous reports of wild bird die-offs secondary to HPAI virus in Florida (notably many waterbird species such as ducks, gulls, and terns). In addition, in 2022, recent mortalities of harbor seals and gray seals in Maine, United States were diagnosed with HPAI A(H5N1), with a small subset of this population displaying neurological signs5. Since the initial introduction of the clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) into North America in 2021, these viruses have spread and affected numerous avian and mammalian species across the United States1,2. This raised the possibility there could have been spillover into another marine species (common bottlenose dolphin) with neurological involvement. This suspicion was subsequently verified by the detection and isolation of A(H5N1) virus in the brain tissues of the dolphin.Previous in vitro research has shown minimal to no attachment of avian A(H4N5) and A(H7N7) avian influenza viruses to the trachea and bronchi of bottlenose dolphins, suggesting that they had low susceptibility to influenza viral infections14,31. This research is similar to the results from our study, as there was limited viral detection of HPAI in the lungs. Our findings showed the highest viral load within brain tissues with limited evidence of systemic dissemination of the virus. Overall, more research is needed to determine the true susceptibility and route of exposure of influenza viruses in cetaceans. Since cetaceans were previously thought to have low susceptibility to influenza viral infections, this study emphasizes the importance of routinely testing for HPAI viruses in all mammals and obtaining proper samples, including brain, during postmortem examinations.The localization of the virus to the CNS in the dolphin is consistent with other HPAI A(H5N1) viral infections in mammals. HPAI virus-infected wild red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the Netherlands had CNS involvement with no detection in the respiratory tract or other organs32. Likewise, a study examining 40 HPAI A(H5N1) viruses in Canada found clinical presentation to be primarily neurological in red foxes, striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and mink (Neovison vison)33. In the case of an infected stone marten (Martes foina), it was believed that the animal had already cleared its respiratory infection and the only notable remaining lesion was its encephalitis24. This raises the possibility that the dolphin may have had pulmonary involvement that was cleared before the neurological manifestations and subsequent death had occurred – however, this is unlikely as no histological evidence of pulmonary disease was found to support this idea. In addition, experimental intranasal inoculation of HPAI A(H5N1) in ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) results in encephalitis through infection of the olfactory mucosa spreading to the CNS via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves34. In contrast, most toothed whales (odontocetes), with the exception of baleen whales (mysticetes), lack olfactory anatomy, eliminating the possibility of olfactory tract neuroinvasion by influenza virus in dolphins35. Instead, a primary hematogenous route of entry into the CNS is suspected, with secondary neuron-to-neuron invasion, suggested by the apparently random distribution and extensive spread of virus infection in the brain. Systemic viral spread may have occurred via direct infection from the intestinal lumen. A study of H5N1 experimentally-infected cats demonstrated ganglioneuritis in the submucosal and myenteric plexi of the small intestine, indicating the potential for direct viral spread via the intestines, especially when respiratory tract disease is absent36. On necropsy, the dolphin had severe ulcerative inflammation of the pharynx with extensive loss of epithelium extending from the caudal tongue past the larynx. Histologically these areas demonstrated moderate to severe mucosal autolysis and no evidence of virus was found. All gastrointestinal sections were also negative for influenza virus nucleoprotein by IHC, so the port of entry for the virus remains unclear in this case. More research needs to be done to determine how the virus spreads to the CNS in this dolphin.The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed at least 10 seabird die-offs related to HPAI A(H5N1) virus during March 2022 in Dixie County, FL between Horseshoe Beach and the mouth of the Suwannee River, where the dolphin was found. The potential exposure route of this dolphin to avian sources of HPAI is speculative, though these birds were thought to be a potential source of infection for this dolphin. However, comparative sequencing from available viruses demonstrated that these bird viruses were not direct precursors. Similarly, the virus isolated from the dolphin was not directly descended from viruses detected in seals in the Northeast United States, ruling out a dominant lineage circulating in marine mammals. The typical route of transmission to carnivorous mammals (via ingestion of infected birds) is thought to be unlikely in marine mammals because birds are not a typical food source for seals or dolphins1,2,4,5. However, there have been instances of dolphins and killer whales in facilities killing birds, such as sea gulls. These instances would increase their exposure to potentially infectious agents. In the wild, killer whales are known to kill and eat birds such as penguins and other sea birds. Williams et al.37 divided killer whale interactions with birds into 3 categories: play, predation, and interaction37 with some encounters similar for smaller cetaceans. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) are known to take birds into the oral cavity when seabirds are feeding on the same prey items and genetic evidence of accidental ingestion of Murrelets (Synthliboramphus antiquus and Brachyramphus marmoratus) has been described in humpback feces38. In addition, some dolphins may strand feed (pushing fish onto muddy banks where they can be ingested). Birds are often in close proximity taking advantage of this technique, therefore fecal and urate exposure would increase. The close proximity of dolphins and sea birds during communal feeding on schools of fish increases the potential exposure from fecal and urates exposure orally, and though highly unlikely, through the external nares above the water surface during inhalation. Birds infected with HPAI may shed infectious virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces1,2,4,5. Therefore, environmental transmission, or through mouthing/biting or inquisitive investigation of the bird in water, may be a likely route of transmission for marine mammals through oral, nasal, or conjunctival routes5,39. However, strand feeding is not a known feeding method used in the area in which this dolphin was found due to the presence of oyster bars; although it is possible the dolphin may have accidentally come in contact with an infected bird while feeding on jumping fish, or while feeding on fish near the surface of the water.Similar to this study, historically, cetaceans infected with low-pathogenic influenza A have displayed secondary neurological signs. For example, a pilot whale recovered off the coast of Maine in 1984 was diagnosed with A(H13N2) and A(H13N9) after demonstrating difficulty swimming and diving20. Similarly, just prior to the dolphin stranding, the UF MAR received an unverified report of a dolphin swimming erratically in the vicinity of the stranding, suggesting that this dolphin could have displayed neurological signs prior to death. Currently, due to the widespread prevalence of HPAI virus within wildlife populations in North America, any cetacean (as well as other marine or terrestrial mammal) displaying neurological signs, whether typical or atypical hosts of influenza, should be considered for testing for HPAI virus.According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), the current health risk of A(H5N1) viruses to humans is relatively low due to the inability for sustained human-to-human transmission2. In this case, replication of the avian A(H5N1) virus in the dolphin did not lead to the acquisition of obvious mammalian adaptive markers. We did, however, note a HA-T192I substitution. This substitution has not been seen in any other 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) virus sequenced from the Americas (using sequences available in GISAID as assessed 1 March 2023). The impact of this substitution on binding to cellular receptors is unclear, although it has been shown in one study to enhance binding of virus with HA-T192I to the mammalian virus preferred α2,6 sialic acids26 but had no impact on binding in another40. More research is needed to understand the impact of the HA-T192I substitution in this dolphin isolate. The other marker of potential relevance to human health was an NA-S246N. This substitution led to a reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir in vitro. How this reduced susceptibility translates to clinical impact is unknown, although it might be anticipated that the drug would still have utility. Additionally, A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1) virus is susceptible to other NAIs (zanamivir and peramivir) and PA protein inhibitor (baloxavir marboxil).Human health risk aside, the consequences of A(H5N1) viruses adapting for enhanced replication in and transmission between dolphins and other cetacea could be catastrophic for these populations. The molecular markers associated with influenza virus adaptation to these hosts is unknown, and, therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is any evidence of it occurring. Enhanced follow up of naturally occurring cetacea A(H5N1) infections with viral sequencing is prudent, with the possibility of identifying common mutations suggestive of host range markers.The detection of HPAI A(H5N1) virus in a bottlenose dolphin emphasizes the importance of following proper biosafety protocols when working with stranded marine mammals. As shown in this case, high viral loads were detected in brain tissues, underscoring the value of obtaining brain tissues during routine postmortem marine mammal examinations39. With no end in sight for the current A(H5N1) outbreak, testing for avian influenza viruses should be a part of future routine health monitoring in marine mammal stranding investigations, especially if the animal displays any neurological signs.MethodsNecropsy and histopathologyA complete gross necropsy of dolphin was performed on 30 March 2022. Sections of the following tissues were retained frozen (−80 °C): lung, liver, brain, kidney, spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid, muscle, skin, and a penile papilloma. A complete set of tissues were collected in 10% neutral buffered formalin: right cortex at caudate nucleus, right diencephalon at thalamus, right mesencephalon and hippocampus, right brainstem and cerebellum, spinal cord, liver, spleen, kidney, right and left adrenals, cranial omentum with debris, thyroid, right and left cranial lung, right and left middle lung, right caudal lung, right distal lung, trachea, tracheal lymph nodes, right and left tonsils, mandibular lymph nodes, cranial esophagus, laryngeal mucosa, laryngeal accessary lymph node, thymus, right and left atria, right and left ventricles, pulmonary artery, pulmonary marginal lymph node, interventricular septum, aorta, diaphragm, blubber and skin, urinary bladder, lumbar vertebral lymph node, glandular soft tissue, pancreas, tongue, pharynx, forestomach, pyloric stomach, glandular stomach, proximal intestine, pulmonary lymph hilar lymph node, middle intestine, mesenteric lymph node, distal intestine, colonic lymph node, prescapular lymph node, melon, testis, penis, right and left pterygoid sinus mucosa, and skeletal muscle and nerve. Representative sections of all tissues were collected, submitted for routine processing, and 5 µm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Additional histochemical stains (Gomori-methenamine silver and periodic acid-Schiff) were utilized on select tissue sections to look for the presence of microorganisms.Virus isolationA/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 A(H5N1) virus was isolated from brain tissue homogenate by inoculation of 10-day old embryonated hens’ eggs incubated at 35 °C for 40 h, and from inoculation of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC-CCL-34) incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 60 h. All were subsequently harvested and stored at −80 °C pending sequence confirmation. All isolation work was performed in approved Biosafety Level 3 enhanced (BSL3-enhanced) laboratories at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN. The virus used in this study is a USDA-classified select agent and is subject to the guidelines and compliance with Title 9 (CFR Parts 121 [Possession, Use, and Transfer of Select Agent Toxins] and 122 [Importation and Transportation of Controlled Organisms and Vectors]).Nucleic acid extraction and real time RT-PCRViral RNA was extracted from the following tissues using Qiagen RNeasy® Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) per the manufacturer’s protocol: brain, spinal cord, kidney, lungs, liver, penis papilloma, muscle, and gastric contents. Freshly extracted RNA was screened using H5-specific primers and probes to test for the presence or absence of HPAI A(H5N1) via real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) according to a protocol established by the US CDC. The definition of rRT-PCR positivity was established based on 10-fold serial dilutions of copy-number control H5 RNA down to approximately one copy number. The CT value of the highest dilution of the controls was determined to be the limit of detection and served as the threshold for determining whether samples were PCR positive or negative. The sequences of primers and probes were obtained from the US CDC (CDC Ref# I-007-05).Hemagglutination inhibition assaysOnce A(H5N1) sequence was confirmed, the antigenic properties of this virus were compared to other recently isolated North American A(H5N1) viruses and A(H5) HA clade 2.3.4.4 antigens and sera as recommended by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). Reference post-infection ferret antiserum was used after treatment with receptor-destroying enzyme II (Denka Seiken Co.) at 37 °C overnight, heat inactivated at 56 °C for 45 min. Assays were conducted with 0.5% chicken red blood cells as described in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza41.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH)Viral antigen and RNA were detected via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), respectively. IHC was performed using the Ventana Discovery Ultra Autostainer (Roche Ventana, Tucson, Arizona, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. FFPE sections (5 μm) were initially heated to 72 °C for 4 min and placed in EZ prep solution (#950-102, Roche Ventana) for deparaffinization. Antigen retrieval was performed at 95 °C in Cell Conditioning Solution 1 (CC1, #950-124, Roche Ventana) for 56 min. A polyclonal primary goat antibody (US Biological, Swampscott, MA) against influenza A/USSR/1977 (H1N1) nucleoprotein at 1:1000 and a secondary biotinylated donkey anti-goat antibody (catalog number sc-2042; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:200 on tissue sections. The DISCOVERY ChromoMap DAB detection kit (#760-159, Roche Ventana) was used as the detection system. Tissue counterstaining was performed with Hematoxylin II solution (#790-2208, Roche Ventana). 6-to-8 week-old female BALB/c H5N1 infected mouse lung was used as the positive control tissue and normal goat serum as the negative control primary antibody. The normal goat serum control was used to rule out any non-specific binding of goat antibodies to formalin-fixed dolphin tissues and no evidence of non-specific binding with the normal goat serum was noted. The results of IHC labeling were then confirmed with a virus-specific ISH assay. To detect the influenza viral RNA in FFPE tissues, ISH was performed using the RNA scope 2.5 HD RED kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 40-ZZ ISH probes (catalog 1048229-C1, V-influenzaA-H5N8-m2m1-C1) targeting influenza RNA were designed and synthesized by Advanced Cell Diagnostics. Tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene, underwent a series of ethanol washes and peroxidase blocking, and were then treated using kit-provided antigen retrieval buffer and proteinase. ISH signal was developed using kit-provided pre-amplifier and amplifier conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and incubated with a fast red substrate solution for 10 min at room temperature. Sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin. The universal negative control probes developed by ACDbio, which target the DapB gene (accession # EF191515) from Bacillus subtilis strain SMY, a soil bacterium were used as controls in ISH.Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysisUsing extracted viral RNA as template, cDNA was synthesized using the Uni-12 primer42 with the Superscript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The influenza A virus gene segments were amplified using modified universal primers in a multi-segment PCR as previously described43. PCR products were then purified using Agentcourt AMPure XP beads according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BeckmanCoulter). Sequence libraries were prepared using the Nextera DNA Prep Kit (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and sequenced using the iSeq Reagent Kit v2 (300-cycles) on the iSeq System (Illumina). Sequencing reads were then quality trimmed and assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench (version 22.0.2) (Qiagen).For the phylogenetic analysis, sequences other than those generated for the study were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Influenza Virus Sequence Database and the EpiFlu database of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). The HA sequences were aligned and trimmed to length based on the full HA coding region using CLC Genomics Workbench version 22.0.2 (Qiagen). The phylogenetic tree of the HA segment was constructed using the neighbor-joining method and Jukes-Cantor substitution model. Genotype data for each gene segment was then determined by BLAST analysis and overlayed with phylogeny using CLC Genomics Workbench version 22.0.2. The GenoFLU tool (https://github.com/USDA-VS/GenoFLU) was used for virus genotyping44. MEGA X was used for the construction of eight phylogenetic trees by applying the Neighbor-Joining method and Kimura 2-parameter model with 1000 bootstrap replicates for aligned and trimmed nucleotide sequences45.Phenotypic susceptibility to NAIsVirus susceptibility to the NAIs oseltamivir carboxylate (oseltamivir), zanamivir, and peramivir (MedChem Express) was determined by fluorometric assay with the substrate 2′-(4-methylumberlliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) (Sigma) as described46, with minor modifications. Equivalent amounts of NA activity for each virus (equal to the fluorescence signal from 10 μM 4-methylumbelliferone) were incubated with log10 serial dilutions of NAI (50 µM to 5 pm) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 100 μM MUNANA for an additional 30 min, 37 °C in assay buffer [32.5 mM MES, 4 mM CaCl2, pH 6.5]. The fluorescence signal of the NA-cleaved substrate was measured at Ex/Em 360 nM/460 nM on a Synergy H1 microplate reader (Biotek). The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) were estimated from dose-response curves using the sigmoidal, four-parameter logistic non-linear regression equation in GraphPad Prism (v9). The results are representative of the median values of four independent dose-response curves. Influenza A/Denmark/524/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 (NA H274, NAI susceptible) and A/Denmark/528/2009 (H1N1)pm09 (NA H274Y, NAI highly reduced susceptibility) were included as reference viruses. Fold-over the N1 subtype matched A/Denmark/524/2009 (H1N1)pm09 virus was used to interpret NAI-susceptibility phenotypes as recommended by the WHO Global Influenza Programme reporting guidelines (https://www.who.inteams/global-influenza-programme/laboratory-network/quality-assurance/antiviral-susceptibility-influenzaeuraminidase-inhibitor); (<10-fold, normal inhibition; 10–100 fold, reduced inhibition; >100-fold, highly reduced inhibition).Phenotypic susceptibility to adamantanes and endonuclease inhibitorsSusceptibility to M2 protein inhibitors (amantadine, rimantadine) and PA protein endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil (BXM) was determined from full-length gene sequences. The M2 splice product from the full-length M gene was analyzed for the presence of M2 substitutions (L26F, V27A, A30T, S31N, or G34E) characteristic of adamantane resistance27. The PA endonuclease domain (residues 1-200) was analyzed for the presence of PA substitutions (E23G/K, I38T/F/M/S/L/N, and/or E119D) characteristic of BXM resistance28.Receptor binding assayFetuin coated 96-well plates were washed three times using a washing buffer (0.23X PBS with 0.01% Tween 80). To prevent nonspecific binding, the coated plates were blocked using 1X PBS containing 1% BSA then the volume of 100 ul of A/bottlenose dolphin/Florida/UFTt2203/2022 (H5N1), A/bald eagle/Florida/W22-134/2022 (H5N1), or A/Memphis/257/2019 (H3N2) viruses having 64 HA units were added to each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Each viral sample was tested in duplicate. Biotinylated sialylglycopolymers, 3’-SialLacNAc-PAA-biotin (3’-SLN) or 6’-SialLacNAc-PAA-biotin (6’-SLN) (Glycotech), were serially diluted in the reaction buffer (1X PBS with 0.02% Tween 80, 0.02% BSA, and 5 µM oseltamivir carboxylate) then added to washed plates having viruses and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Plates were washed and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:2000) was added to the plates and incubated for 1 h. Following another round of washing, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the plates and kept at room temperature for developing color then the reaction was terminated by adding 1 N H2SO4. The absorbance of the plates was measured at an optical density (O.D.) of 490 nm.Statistics and data reproducibilityNeuraminidase susceptibility data were derived from four separate dose-response curves consisting of 10 serial log10 dilutions of each drug. Receptor binding data was derived from two independent experiments consisting of duplicate repeat measures of each the 7 ligand dilutions.

Facebook Twitter Print Email Pandemic experts express concern over avian influenza spread to humans 18 April 2024 Health The ongoing global spread of “bird flu” infections to mammals including humans is a significant public health concern, senior UN medics said on Thursday as they announced new measures to tackle airborne diseases. Dr. Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at the World Health Organization (WHO), said that the avian influenza virus, which is also known as H5N1, has had an “extremely high” mortality rate among the several hundred people known to have been infected with it to date.However, no human-to-human H5N1 transmission has yet been recorded.“H5N1 is (an) influenza infection, predominantly started in poultry and ducks and has spread effectively over the course of the last one or two years to become a global zoonotic – animal – pandemic,” he said. “The great concern, of course, is that in doing so and infecting ducks and chickens – but now increasingly mammals – that that virus now evolves and develops the ability to infect humans. And then critically, the ability to go from human-to-human transmission.”Cattle mysteryCommenting on an ongoing outbreak of the H5N1 virus among dairy cows in the United States, the WHO senior official urged further close monitoring and investigation by public health authorities “because it may evolve into transmitting in different ways”.“Do the milking structures of cows create aerosols? Is it the environment which they’re living in? Is it the transport system that is spreading this around the country?" he asked. "This is a huge concern and I think we have to … make sure that if H5N1 did come across to humans with human-to-human transmission that we were in a position to immediately respond with access equitably to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.” Unsplash/Donald Giannatti Cows graze near a drilling rig in Texas, USA. Equal to next pandemicThe development comes as WHO announced updated language to describe airborne pathogens in a bid to increase international cooperation in the event of a new and expected global pandemic.The initiative was originally sparked by the COVID-19 emergency and the recognition that there was a lack of commonly agreed terms among medics and scientists to describe how the coronavirus was transmitted, which increased the challenge of overcoming it, Dr. Farrar explained.Global appealTo counter this, WHO led consultations with four major public health agencies from Africa, China, Europe and the United States before announcing agreement on a number of new terms. These include “infectious respiratory particles” or “IRPs”, which should be used instead of “aerosols” and “droplets” to avoid any confusion about the size of the particles involved.Over and above the new terminology, the initiative cements the commitment of the international community to tackle ever “more complex and more frequent epidemics and pandemics”, Dr. Farrar told journalists in Geneva.“It's a hugely important first step. But next, we need to keep the disciplines, the experts together. "We're using the same terminology, the same language and now we need to do the science that provides the evidence on tuberculosis, on COVID and other respiratory pathogens so that we know how to control those infections better than we have done in the past.” On the potential HN51 public health risk, the WHO chief scientist cautioned that vaccine development was not “where we need to be”. Neither was it the case that regional offices and country offices and public health authorities around the world have the capability to diagnose H5N1, he noted. ♦ Receive daily updates directly in your inbox - Subscribe here to a topic. ♦ Download the UN News app for your iOS or Android devices. animal health Related Stories Over 4,700 UN agency trained veterinarians new vanguard against deadly disease outbreaks UN reports major progress towards eradicating sheep and goat plague Stories from the UN Archive: Retro cutting-edge tech at the UN Resources Button collapse Navigate the News Information for Broadcasters UN System Links Media Alert UN Journal Meetings Coverage Audiovisual Library Secretary-General Button collapse All Statements Official Travels Press Encounters SG Twitter Spokesperson's Office Button collapse Latest Statements Briefing Highlights Briefing Transcripts Notes to Correspondents Find Us Button collapse UN News App Facebook Twitter YouTube RSS Footer menu A-Z Site Index Copyright FAQ Fraud Alert Privacy Notice Terms of Use Social Media Links Footer buttons Donate Facebook Twitter Print EmailMDARD - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Detected in Newaygo County Flock Skip to main content Agriculture and Rural Development Agriculture & Rural Development About MDARD About MDARD collapsed link Animals Animals collapsed link Business Development Business Development collapsed link Environment Environment collapsed link Food & Dairy Food & Dairy collapsed link Lab Services Lab Services collapsed link Licensing Licensing collapsed link Plant & Pest Plant & Pest collapsed link About MDARD Go to About MDARD Bureaus Reports and Notices Boards, Councils, and Commissions Contact Us / File a Complaint Emergency Preparedness Michigan Food and Agriculture Industry Jobs Laws and Regulations Media Room Online Services Bureaus Go to Bureaus Learn about MDARD's four bureaus, including contact information, by clicking the above link, or view specific information below.

Since the disease was first detected in Michigan in 2022, this is the seventh detection of HPAI in a commercial facility, and the first detection in Newaygo County. As wild birds complete their spring migration, it is crucial for every producer to protect their animals from wild birds and the germs they could be carrying. "MDARD continues to thoroughly and robustly respond to the detection of HPAI with an all-hands-on-deck approach with our federal, state, and local partners," said MDARD Director Tim Boring. "Biosecurity remains the best tool available to combat HPAI, and we continue to encourage producers of all sizes to enhance their biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of introducing this disease to their farm. MDARD is addressing this outbreak from every angle, including working to help mitigate the economic impacts on local communities. We remain laser-focused on our mission to protect animal and public health." "Taking preventative measures to keep wild birds away from farms is essential to combatting HPAI and limiting its impact," said State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland, DVM, MS, DACVPM. "As wild birds continue to migrate and the outside temperatures remain cool and temperate, conditions are ideal for the virus to spread. This is why it is so vital for producers to assess the risks on their premises and tighten protocols. Protecting animal health is of the utmost importance." HPAI is a highly contagious virus that can be spread in various ways, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. To protect other facilities in Michigan, the premises is currently under quarantine, and the birds will be depopulated to prevent disease spread. These efforts also help to ensure the safety and integrity of the commercial food supply. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the public health risk associated with avian influenza remains low. Also, no animals or products infected with HPAI will enter the commercial food chain. As a reminder, people should properly handle and cook all food. Whether it's a few backyard birds or a large commercial flock, following a few key steps is fundamental to protect the health and vitality of Michigan's domestic birds: Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed. Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops. Disinfect boots and other gear when moving between coops. Do not share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms. Clean and disinfect equipment and other supplies between If it cannot be disinfected, discard it. Use well or municipal water as drinking water for birds. Keep poultry feed secure to ensure there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents. MDARD is continuing to work diligently with local, state, and federal partners to quickly respond to reports of HPAI to best mitigate the spread of the disease and provide outreach. Reporting Possible Cases For Domestic Birds Domestic bird owners and caretakers should watch for multiple sudden deaths in the flock, a drop in egg production, a significant decrease in water consumption, diarrhea, sneezing/coughing, or an increase in sick birds. If avian influenza is suspected in domestic birds, contact MDARD immediately at 800-292-3939 (daytime) or 517-373-0440 (after- hours). For Wild Birds If anyone notices what appears to be unusual or unexplained deaths among wild bird populations, please report these cases to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) by: Using the DNR's Eyes in the Field app. Choose the Diseased Wildlife option among the selections for Observation Forms.

May Be the Chancellor The Backdrop Thursday Thoughts UC Davis LIVE Unfold Avian Influenza Status Update From Poultry to Wildlife, UC Davis Tracks 'Unprecedented' Avian Influenza Impacts by Malia Reiss April 16, 2024 Blogs (Gregory Urquiaga, UC Davis) Avian influenza continues to spread worldwide. UC Davis scientists are helping to monitor its expansion among wildlife, poultry and other species. Wildlife and avian flu In early April, Marcela Uhart, director of the Latin America Program at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, addressed the current state of avian flu at a webinar hosted by the UC Davis Grand Challenges’ Institute for Pandemic Intelligence. “It is causing a totally unprecedented scale of global spread and mortality,” said Uhart on the newest strain. “We have never seen anything like this before. It’s killing hundreds of thousands of birds, and tens of thousands of mammals.” Uhart is especially worried about new strains and virus movement into new species. Currently, the largest scales of mortality have been documented in seabirds, waterfowl, and mammals like elephant seals. A few human cases have also been documented, along with cases in domestic pets and livestock. Uhart has documented cases in the wild from the beaches of Argentina to Antarctica, and continues to track the impacts on affected ecosystems. “For those of us who have been on the beaches these last couple of years, you experience the silence–these animals are just not there." “For those of us who have been on the beaches these last couple of years, you experience the silence––these animals are just not there,” Uhart said. “ Maybe over time they’ll come back, but we just don’t know what the consequences are. In the conservation world, we’re bringing this message that we need to be more alert and monitor what the impacts are in the near future.” The spread to poultry Cases of avian influenza have jumped from wild birds to commercial and backyard poultry farms across the United States and Canada. Maurice Pitesky, associate professor in Cooperative Extension at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, and Shane Feirer with University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, have developed an interactive map showing its spread from November 2021 to present day, with red dots representing wild bird cases, purple representing commercial poultry, and gray representing backyard poultry.

This is the key outcome of EFSA’s new scientific opinion, which also assesses risk mitigation options following emergency and preventive vaccination. EFSA was asked to give a comprehensive overview of effective surveillance options and risk reduction measures for avian influenza. Our scientists assessed these measures and evaluated whether the available surveillance strategies could demonstrate freedom from the disease thereby enabling the safe movement of poultry and related products. Our experts looked specifically at surveillance strategies for emergency and preventive vaccination scenarios, setting out the target species A subdivision of the genus, a species is a group of closely related and similar-looking organisms; for example, in the case of Homo sapiens (humans), the second part of the name (sapiens) represents the species of poultry (layer chicken, turkey or duck), the number of animals to be tested, the diagnostic method, and the sampling period. In the case of emergency vaccination for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), our scientists concluded that surveillance schemes for the early detection of new outbreaks should consider the poultry type and flock size to be effective. If vaccination is preventive, to prove the absence of the disease monthly virological testing of up to 15 dead birds is recommended to safeguard the movement of poultry and related products. Also, both vaccinated and unvaccinated flocks should be subjected to passive surveillance The reporting and investigation of increased mortality, other signs of serious disease or significantly reduced production rates with an undetermined cause in a targeted animal population. Experts from the EU reference laboratory and EFSA worked closely to recommend the most appropriate diagnostic tests for surveillance according to vaccine type, vaccination strategy (i.e. emergency or preventive), and the scope of the surveillance. More sensitive methods should be used when the amount of virus in the blood is likely to be low due to vaccination. “Vaccination is an important tool in the fight against avian influenza and is recommended as part of an integrated disease control approach. Nonetheless, there is a need to follow up with a strategic surveillance scheme and implement measures to reduce the risk of virus transmission” said Frank Verdonck, head of EFSA’s Biological Hazards and Animal Health and Welfare Unit. “Maintaining a high level of biosecurity remains essential, even when vaccination is used. Raising awareness among farm owners and practitioners can help to ensure that any changes in poultry production or increased mortality are promptly reported and acted upon”, he continued. In a previous opinion, published in October 2023, EFSA gave its scientific advice on available HPAI vaccines for poultry and suitable vaccination programmes. EFSA’s advice will help inform decisions by risk managers at a European and national level on effective surveillance strategies to implement in vaccinated areas and on farms, both for the early detection of HPAI outbreaks and to demonstrate freedom from the disease.

Share Tweet Save Share Print Email Safe handling and cooking practices can help eliminate the risk of avian influenza. Photo: Pixabay. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that avian influenza, commonly known as “bird flu,” has been detected in dairy cow herds in multiple states. With news organizations publishing multiple avian influenza stories, it is natural to feel concerned. Consumers, however, don’t need to worry about contracting avian influenza from eating properly handled and cooked poultry and eggs. Additionally, similarly to eggs, the CDC states that “it is safe to drink commercial milk, because products are pasteurized before entering the market. Pasteurization kills bacteria and viruses, like influenza viruses, in milk.” Avian influenza can be found in wild birds, backyard poultry flocks, commercial poultry farms and even cattle farms, but is considered by the CDC to pose a low risk to most people. “Avian influenza” refers to the infection of birds with avian influenza Type A viruses. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. The CDC asserts that “the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 [degrees Fahrenheit] kills bacteria and viruses, including HPAI A(H5) viruses.” Poultry should always be properly handled and cooked. Michigan State University Extension advises consumers to follow these safe food practices when storing, handling and cooking poultry to eliminate the risk of avian influenza: Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds (equal to singing the “Happy Birthday” song all the way through twice) before and after handling shell eggs. Cook eggs until both the yolk and the white are firm. Never eat raw eggs or food with raw egg ingredients such as cookie dough or cake batter. Cook all dishes containing eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Use a food thermometer to ensure that your poultry is thoroughly cooked. Poultry such as chicken or turkey should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Cooking poultry to 165 degrees kills foodborne pathogens that might be present, such as Salmonella and E. coli. Prevent cross-contamination of foods by keeping all raw poultry and their juices away from other items including other food, food contact surfaces and equipment. After cutting raw poultry, wash your cutting board, knife, and countertops with hot, soapy water. To reduce the number of germs, you can then sanitize cutting boards by using a solution of chlorine bleach in water. For instructions on how to properly create a sanitizing solution, refer to MSU Extension's Safe Sanitizing and Disinfecting fact sheet. Never leave raw poultry at room temperature. Place raw poultry in the bottom of the refrigerator in a bowl or on a plate. If raw poultry is not used within one to two days, freeze it for no longer than 12 months for best quality. Never wash raw poultry. The juices that splash during washing can transfer pathogens onto the surfaces of your kitchen, other foods and utensils. If cooking in an oven, place the poultry in a roasting pan and set the oven temperature no lower than 325 degrees. When barbecuing outdoors, keep poultry refrigerated until it is ready to be cooked. Do not place cooked poultry on the same plate that was used for raw poultry. When marinating raw poultry, always throw away used marinade. Never reuse the marinade from raw poultry on cooked poultry. Following these food safety practices at home can help keep you and your family safe from foodborne illnesses.

Though the virus is circulating in dairy cows, human exposure remains low, Johns Hopkins public health experts say By Bloomberg School of Public Health staff report / Published April 15, 2024 Media Inquiries NameLindsay Smith Rogers Emaillsmit197@jhu.edu The H5N1 strain of avian influenza—commonly known as bird flu—has been circulating among wild migratory birds for the past two years, with substantial spillover into poultry farms. But what's sparking concern among scientists and public health officials alike is the recent discovery of the virus in dairy cows and the subsequent infection of a dairy farm employee—the second person in America ever documented to be infected with H5N1. The virus has now spread to 16 herds in six states according to the United States Department of Agriculture, fueling concerns about potential further transmission to humans. In this Q&A, adapted from the April 8 episode of Public Health On Call, Stephanie Desmon speaks with Meghan Davis, associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, and Andrew Pekosz, professor in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, about H5N1's jump between species, what that means for the virus's pandemic potential, and what the appearance of the virus in dairy means for consumers. What's going on with the avian flu? Pekosz: This virus has been around for over 20 years. It's been mutating over time, and something happened in the last couple of years to cause an explosion of cases in wild birds. Not surprisingly, that's led to spillover infections in some poultry farms. There's also been an increase in mammals that have been infected, such as skunks, bears, and foxes, presumably from feeding on dead infected birds. And recently, we've seen spillover of this virus into dairy cows. Cattle have not been reported to be infected with any of the influenza A viruses—human or animal—to date. Anytime this virus enters a new host, we set off some alarm bells in the scientific community to see what's going on. Can we expect to see more cases in humans? Pekosz: I expect that over the next few weeks, we're going to be seeing more cases in cows and humans, because humans are in close contact with cows during many dairy processes. Hopefully, this will not be a large outbreak, but we certainly expect to see more cases. Were you surprised by this H5N1 outbreak? Davis: I am surprised that it's in dairy cows, because when we think about animal models for influenza, we think about mustelids, like ferrets or mink. We have also seen a number of sick farm cats that tested positive. What is most interesting about seeing [H5N1] in dairy is that researchers haven't been focusing on biosecurity and biocontainment for things like avian influenza—which is typically transmitted from a bird reservoir. Dairy farms are often quite open to the air—birds might spend time in areas where the cows eat, for example. One of the other things we are seeing is some symptoms of disease in the cows. I've not heard of high mortality yet, but they have been showing fairly nonspecific signs, like not eating or milking well. Most of these tend to be somewhat older cows because adult cows who are lactating are in a different category of susceptibility than young calves. What we don't know yet is if perhaps the virus is in all the populations within the farm, and only some of them are showing symptoms. Is the milk they produce safe for consumption? Davis: For the average person buying commercial milk, we don't have any evidence that would suggest concern. If you buy pasteurized milk from a commercial dairy processor, the risk is extremely low. Pasteurization, which involves temperature and pressure and time, is designed to inactivate microbes to make the milk safer to consume and to give it longer shelf life. I strongly advise against consuming raw milk products, no matter where you live, because there are other risks, not just avian influenza. What can the surveillance data from infected cows tell us? Pekosz: Two things are really important. One is: The virus has gone from the respiratory tract through lots of different organs, through the blood, and made it all the way to the milk. In humans, the influenza virus stays within the respiratory tract. We have seen H5N1 move out of the respiratory tract in other animals, but usually that's associated with a really fast mortality. As soon as the virus leaves the lungs, the animals are so sick that they die. We're seeing a case here where the animals don't seem to be really sick, but the virus is making it to other parts of the animal. That's going to tell us something perhaps unique about the H5N1 virus compared to seasonal human viruses. The second critical thing is: If there is spread of this virus from cow to cow, is the virus changing and getting better adapted to replicating or spreading in cows? Bird flu jumping to mammals is important because anything that allows the virus to adapt to a mammal has the potential for making it better able to infect humans. Understanding what happens now with the spread of the virus and how the sequence of the virus changes is going to be critically important. The first sequences [from cows] look like the virus is almost identical to the bird virus. But we haven't really sampled animals that presumably acquired the infection from other cows. If H5N1 is spreading from cow to cow, is that a wholly different problem? Davis: There is a lot of swapping of cows in the dairy industry, and there is a diverse population of farmers, each of them has their own way of doing things. And that means that we may need to educate farmers about perhaps restricting certain sales or trade of dairy cows if evidence shows that you could introduce avian flu through a cow brought in from outside the farm. The USDA has released recommendations for state animal health officials, veterinarians, and producers, including trying to exclude birds and cats from areas where livestock are kept, not moving sick or exposed cows, using PPE among workers with exposure to dairy cows, and other measures. Something I'm very interested in is: Where were each of these cows exposed? To what degree was this one event that is now spreading through these networks of sale and trade and movement of dairy cows? Or is this multiple events in which you've had an introduction [of the virus] from birds? Because that also changes the dynamics as we think about genetics and the potential for evolution. Pekosz: It's also clear that the USDA has not ruled out that spread from cow to cow is happening via contaminated milking equipment because the amount of virus in the milk is much greater than what is found in the nose of infected cows. If this is contributing to virus spread, it should be straightforward to institute equipment disinfection protocols that could slow or stop virus spread. Is avian flu considered a major threat at this time? Pekosz: H5N1 registers as what we call "a virus with pandemic potential." Humans presumably all have some immunity to H1 and H3 influenza viruses, which can cause seasonal epidemics, but they can't cause pandemics at the level of what we saw with COVID because there's just too much immunity in the population that limits the spread and dampens down disease severity. However, the human population is essentially completely naive—has no preexisting immunity—to H5 viruses. Therefore, similar to what we saw with COVID, in the worst case scenario, if this virus enters humans and starts to spread, all of us are susceptible, and we could see massive increases in numbers of cases. H5 viruses are rather deadly in poultry. They're not so deadly in wild birds, but they seem to be deadly in mammals, and we don't know what they'll do in humans. Davis: Right now, the average person should just be aware and avoid things like raw milk products. However, because we are seeing the potential for disease in cats, and we don't know yet if that came from cows or birds or some other pathway—it's a good idea to prevent your cats from having contact with wild birds. If they're indoors, keep them indoors, and if they become ill, consult your veterinarian. This article originally appeared on the Bloomberg School of Public Health website.

It is therefore particularly important for those suffering from diabetes to be vaccinated against influenza each year. However, influenza vaccination coverage remains low in this population. This review primarily aims to identify the determinants of influenza vaccination in people with diabetes (T1D or T2D). Secondly, it aims to assess main recommendations for influenza vaccination, vaccine effectiveness, vaccination coverage, and how education and pharmacists can encourage uptake of the vaccine in the diabetic population. Methods: A scoping review was conducted in January 2022 to systematically review evidence on influenza vaccination in people with diabetes using data from PubMed, Science Direct, and EM Premium with terms such as “Diabetes mellitus,” “Immunization Programs,” “Vaccination,” and “Influenza Vaccines.” Quality assessment and data extraction were independently conducted by two authors. Disagreements between the authors were resolved through discussion and consensus, and if necessary, by consulting a third author. Results: Of the 333 records identified, 55 studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. Influenza vaccination was recommended for people ≥6 months. Despite effectiveness evidence showing a reduction in mortality and hospitalizations in people with diabetes vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated ones, very few studies reported a coverage rate ≥ 75%, which is WHO’s target objective. Determinants such as advanced age, presence of comorbidities and healthcare givers’ advice were associated with increased vaccination uptake. On the contrary, fear of adverse reactions and concerns about vaccine effectiveness were significant barriers. Finally, education and pharmacists’ intervention played a key role in promoting vaccination and increasing vaccination uptake. Conclusion: Influenza vaccination coverage in people with diabetes remains low despite recommendations and evidence on vaccine effectiveness. Motivators and barriers as well as several socio-demographic and clinical factors have been identified to explain this trend. Efforts are now needed to increase the number of diabetics vaccinated against influenza, mainly through education and the involvement of healthcare givers. 1 Introduction Diabetes mellitus represents a significant global health challenge, affecting over half a billion people worldwide with its prevalence on an upward trajectory (1). The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) has documented an important increase in the global diabetes population: from 285 million in 2009 to 537 million in 2021, marking an approximate 90% surge in just over a decade (1–4). Projections suggest this number could reach 782 million by 2045 (1). As prevalence rises, so does the burden of disease, as evidenced by the number of diabetes-related deaths, estimated at 6.7 million in 2021 (1). Given its substantial contribution to healthcare costs, effective management of diabetes is essential. The global economic burden of diabetes, regardless of type, is estimated at more than 1.3 trillion dollars per year worldwide, primarily due to the management of diabetes-associated complications and hospitalizations (5). Among these complications, infectious diseases pose a significant risk, with people with diabetes experiencing higher susceptibility and severity of infections, including seasonal influenza (6, 7). Prospective observational studies have consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in reducing influenza-related complications and mortality in the diabetic population (8). Consequently, annual influenza vaccination is universally recommended for people with diabetes by health authorities (9, 10). Despite these recommendations, influenza vaccination coverage among the diabetic population remains low in many regions, significantly below the target objective of 75% set by European health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) (11, 12). Achieving this coverage could result in substantial healthcare savings, estimated between 190 and 260 million euros, through the reduction of influenza-related hospitalizations (13). The discrepancy between vaccination guidelines and actual coverage rates, especially in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of concurrent epidemics, underscores the critical need to understand and address the barriers to vaccination in the diabetic population. To date, literature reviews have synthesized the coverage and determinants of influenza vaccination in the general population, but none to our knowledge, has addressed its issues in people with diabetes. To fill this gap, this review primarily aims to identify the determinants of influenza vaccination in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). Secondly, it aims to assess main recommendations for influenza vaccination, vaccine effectiveness, vaccination coverage, and how education and pharmacists can encourage uptake of the vaccine in the diabetic population. A better understanding of the current concepts and challenges may facilitate the development of improved strategies to increase influenza vaccination coverage in people with diabetes. 2 Methods 2.1 Literature search strategy A scoping review approach was developed and used to systematically review evidence on influenza vaccination in people with diabetes (14). In a pilot search, multiple iterations of terms were queried to identify the most appropriate search terms, thus refining the search strategy and ensuring the selection of the most relevant literature. The literature search was conducted across PubMed, Science Direct, and EM premium using terms such as “Diabetes mellitus,” “Immunization Programs,” “Vaccination,” and “Influenza Vaccines.” The search results were restricted to articles in French or English, reflecting the language competencies of the readers. The search focused on articles published between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2019. This period was strategically chosen to begin with the year following the American Diabetes Association’s 2002 report on influenza vaccination for people with diabetes, aligning with the WHO’s 2003 directive for achieving 75% influenza vaccination coverage by 2010 in populations with chronic diseases (15, 16). The endpoint of December 31, 2019, was selected to delineate the pre-COVID-19 era, acknowledging the pandemic’s significant disruption to influenza vaccination efforts and the comparability with subsequent data (17). 2.2 Selection of studies Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts using a designed evaluation grid tailored to the review’s specific criteria and objectives. This structured approach facilitated the identification of studies potentially eligible for inclusion. After this initial screening, they independently assessed the full text of the chosen studies in detail, continuing to use the evaluation grid to ensure a systematic and thorough evaluation. Disagreements between the authors were resolved through discussion and consensus, and if necessary, by consulting a third review author. The results of the search, the inclusion of studies, and excluded studies and the reasons for their exclusion were reported in a PRISMA flow diagram (18). 2.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria included: full-text availability, study involving adult diabetic populations (T1D or T2D), cross-sectional, cohort, case–control studies, randomized controlled trial, quantitative or qualitative evaluation. Exclusion criteria included: non original research (i.e., letters or commentaries), meeting abstract, articles not focusing on influenza vaccination in diabetic populations, and articles not yielding relevant information for this review. 2.4 Study quality assessment Scoping reviews are different from systematic reviews, as they include broader topics as well as studies with more diverse designs. Consequently, scoping reviews typically do not focus on the quality assessment of the included studies (19). Accordingly, the quality assessment of the included studies was not performed. However, this review includes the identification and explanation of the different biases encountered in the studies included. 3 Results 3.1 Identified literature The literature search led to the identification of 333 documents in the relevant databases described above (Figure 1). After duplicates were removed (n = 40), all remaining articles were first scanned by title and abstract. The full texts of 92 reports were retrieved, of which 55 met the inclusion criteria for the review. Of those reports retrieved but not included (n = 37), 15 studies were letters, commentaries, or meeting abstracts, 10 studies focused on children with diabetes or non-diabetic people, 10 studies lacked information on methods or population selection, two were not accessible. Figure 1 Figure 1. Flowchart of the study selection process. 3.2 Descriptive analysis of articles Between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2019, 55 studies of influenza vaccination in people with diabetes, from different WHO regions were included (Figure 2). The studies were unevenly distributed across the years and regions. The year with the highest number of studies was 2016 (n = 6), reflecting a growing interest in the topic. The early years (2002 to 2009) witnessed fewer studies, but there was a noticeable increase in the number of studies conducted each year after that. Most studies originated from the Americas and Europe, indicating a strong research interest in these regions. Other WHO regions (Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific) also contributed studies, though to a lesser extent. Figure 2 Figure 2. Total number of studies about influenza vaccination in persons with diabetes by year of publication (Jan. 1, 2002–Dec. 31, 2019) and region (n = 55). Among the 55 studies included, four studied focused on current recommendations for influenza vaccination in diabetic populations, seven studies covered influenza vaccine effectiveness in people with diabetes, 38 studies assessed the influenza vaccination coverage rate and/or its determinants in diabetic populations, and six publications explored the role of education and pharmacist in promoting influenza immunization in people with diabetes. 3.3 Current recommendations for influenza vaccination Four publications addressing vaccine recommendations in people with chronic diseases, and more specifically diabetes, were included in this review (20–23). The American Diabetes Association, in two separate articles published in 2003 and 2004, focused on the critical role of immunization in preventing influenza and pneumococcal disease in people with diabetes (20, 21). Similarly, in 2013, the Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines Expert Committee highlighted the importance of influenza and pneumococcal immunizations for people with diabetes (22). Building on this, a 2014 publication by the American Association of Diabetes Educators emphasized the essential need for hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccinations in people with diabetes (23). All these publications supported immunization for people with diabetes aged ≥6 months (20–23). 3.4 Influenza vaccine effectiveness Seven publications on the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in people with diabetes were included in the review (Supplementary Table S1) (24–30). Three of these studies targeted individuals aged ≥65 years, while the remaining four also considered those <65 years. Heymann et al., observed a 12% decrease in All-Cause Hospitalization (ACH) rates for both T1D and T2D persons aged ≥65 years (27). A Canadian study involving participants aged ≥18 years reported the vaccine was associated to a 43% decrease in pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations, and a 28% decrease in ACH (24). A Dutch study, reported a 56% decrease in all complications, a 54% decrease in ACH, and a 58% decrease in All-Cause Mortality (ACM) for patients aged ≥18 years with T1D or T2D (26). Similarly, a Spanish study reported a 33% decrease in ACM among those aged ≥65 years (25). Further, Norwegian study reported a 78% decrease in influenza hospitalizations for individuals aged ≥30 years with T2D (28). In the United Kingdoms, vaccination was associated with lower hospitalization rates for stroke, heart failure, pneumonia, influenza, and ACM in patients aged ≥18 years with T2D (29). Lastly, Taiwanese study showed an 11% decrease in ACH and fewer intensive care admissions, alongside a decrease in ACM among those aged ≥65 years (30). Three primary biases were identified in studies assessing the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in people with diabetes. Firstly, the “healthy vaccinee bias” indicated that vaccinated individuals typically engaged in healthier behaviors than their non-vaccinated counterparts. Such behaviors included more effective diabetes management, more frequent doctor visits, and greater attention to overall health. This bias could partly account for the observed lower mortality rates in vaccinated individuals, independent of the vaccination’s direct effects. To discern this bias, mortality rates outside the seasonal influenza epidemic periods were examined. Lower mortality rates in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated diabetic individuals during non-epidemic times suggested benefits not directly linked to influenza vaccination, as exposure to the virus was not a factor (24). Secondly, a bias concerning pneumococcal vaccination status was noted. Individuals regularly vaccinated against influenza were also more likely to receive pneumococcal vaccinations. Rodriguez et al. found that among diabetic individuals vaccinated annually for influenza, 70% had also received a pneumococcal vaccine, compared to only 22% among those not vaccinated for influenza (25). Given that pneumococcal pneumonia is a common complication of seasonal influenza, a reduction in hospitalizations and mortality rates might have been more accurately attributed to pneumococcal rather than influenza vaccination. Lastly, selection bias was observed, wherein diabetic individuals with comorbidities are more frequently vaccinated. These comorbidities were associated with an increased risk of complications, possibly leading to an underestimation of the influenza vaccine’s effectiveness (26). The lack of distinction between T1D and T2D also introduced bias. Individuals with T2D, who were more prone to complications from an influenza infection due to multiple comorbidities, may have skewed effectiveness results (25–27). 3.5 Prevalence of influenza vaccination Despite recommendations advocating for influenza vaccination in people with diabetes, actual vaccination coverage remained relatively low across regions (20–23). Thirty-one studies focused on assessing influenza vaccination coverage in the diabetic population (Supplementary Table S2) (31–61). In Europe, vaccination coverage has shown variability: the Netherlands reported a high of 85% in 1999, with a decline to 75% by 2013 (44, 45). Spain’s coverage fluctuated between 34 and 66% from 1993 to 2018 (47–49, 51–53, 55, 56), while Belgium saw an increase from 46% in 2006 to 49% in 2010 (40–42). Ireland and Switzerland maintained rates around 65% (43, 57), contrasting with Poland’s lower 27% (46), and Austria’s range of 6% in 1991 to 21–22% in 2006–2007 (39). In the Americas, the United States experienced coverage rates between 49 and 62% (33–37), while Brazil showed an upward trend to 59% in 2015 (31), and Canada reported a 63% coverage rate (32). The Western Pacific region saw Australia and Taiwan with rates around 30–35% (58, 61), while China and Korea reported higher rates of approximately 50–55% (59, 60). In the Eastern Mediterranean, Saudi Arabia reported a 61% coverage rate (38). The main bias for the aforementioned studies was the assessment of vaccination status via a questionnaire or survey for some of them. This approach introduced a social-desirability bias, where individuals might have claimed to be vaccinated to align with the positive perception of vaccination, especially since influenza vaccination is strongly recommended for people with diabetes. Such a tendency to report vaccination favorably, regardless of actual vaccination status, may have led to inflate the estimated vaccination rate in some of the studies (47, 52, 54). Another significant bias was nonresponse bias, which occurred when the responses collected represented only a portion of the target group, with some studies noted non-responder rates of 30–50% (52). This bias raised concerns about the accuracy of the results, as the true vaccination coverage might have been different if all individuals had responded. Memory bias also played a crucial role, as participants were asked to recall their vaccination history. This bias may have led to inaccuracies, particularly for vaccinations received in more distant years, affecting the reliability of reported vaccination rates (61). Additionally, the challenge of underdiagnosis of diabetes in some populations, coupled with the inadequate distinction between T1D and T2D, introduced further biases into the studies (47). 3.6 Determinants of influenza vaccination 3.6.1 Barriers and motivators Twenty-four studies investigating the determinants influencing influenza vaccination coverage in people with diabetes were included in this review (31, 32, 35, 37, 38, 43, 46, 47, 51, 52, 54–56, 58–68) (Figure 3). A primary barrier identified was concern over adverse reactions, which disproportionately affected women (54, 63). Jiménez-García et al. found that fear of adverse reactions was a significantly more common reason for vaccine avoidance among women (32.5%) compared to men (20.2%) (54). Risk perception-related reasons were also commonly cited as barriers to influenza vaccination. People with diabetes who reported no need for the vaccine (47, 65, 66), perceived themselves to be in good health or not at risk (46, 54, 62), and considered influenza as a minor illness (38, 54, 64), were less inclined to get vaccinated. In regions where influenza vaccination was not financially covered for people with diabetes, vaccine cost was also reported as a major barrier to vaccination (46, 62, 64, 66). Moreover, a lack of information about influenza vaccination (46, 62, 66), particularly concerning safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, along with misconceptions (e.g., the belief that the vaccine could cause influenza) (38, 54, 65), were also major obstacles to vaccination. Finally, the controversy surrounding the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic further eroded trust in the pharmaceutical industry and health authorities, leading to decreased vaccination rates in the diabetic population in some regions, notably France, since 2009 (63). Figure 3 Figure 3. Barriers and motivators concerning influenza vaccination for people with diabetes. On the other hand, factors emerged as significant motivators for influenza vaccination in people with diabetes (Figure 3), with advice from healthcare providers standing out as a critical influence. A substantial proportion of vaccinated individuals, ranging from 80 to 90%, reported following their physician’s recommendation as the reason for getting vaccinated (38, 46, 47, 54, 59, 62, 64–66). Besides healthcare advice, recommendations from relatives (38, 62, 66), exposure to media campaigns (38), and personal narratives from already vaccinated individuals also played notable roles in motivating people to seek vaccination (64). A deep understanding of the importance of vaccination was also identified as a key motivator (38, 61). Olatunbosun et al. reported that individuals with a comprehensive understanding of both seasonal influenza and its vaccination were 3.8 times more likely to be vaccinated compared to those with limited knowledge (64). Additional motivators included the perceived safety (59, 61, 62), and effectiveness of the vaccine (59, 62), vaccine free of charge (62, 64), and a personal feeling of susceptibility to influenza (52, 62). 3.6.2 Socio-demographics factors Age was a significant factor for influenza vaccination in people with diabetes, with studies reported higher age was associated with increased vaccination rates (31, 32, 37, 43, 47, 51, 52, 54–56, 58, 60, 61, 63, 64, 67) (Figure 4). Shin et al. found that 79% of individuals aged ≥65 years were vaccinated, compared to 34% in the 40–64 age group (60). Jimenez-Trujillo et al. observed that the likelihood of vaccination in diabetic individuals aged 60–69 was more than triple that of those aged 50–59, and around six times greater for those aged ≥70 years (52). Gender also influenced vaccination coverage, with male diabetic patients in Spain showing increased vaccination rates (47, 48, 52). However, studies from Korea and Taiwan reported a decrease in vaccination rates among males (60, 61). Additionally, higher income groups were associated with increased vaccination coverage (37, 46, 60, 66, 67). Tan et al. highlighted that individuals earning more than $4,000 per month were three times more likely to get vaccinated than those earning below $2,000 (66). Figure 4 Figure 4. Socio-demographic factors associated with an increase or a decrease in influenza vaccination. 3.6.3 Clinical factors The presence of comorbidities, particularly lung and cardiac diseases, significantly influenced vaccination coverage (32, 38, 46, 47, 51, 52, 54, 61, 67) (Figure 5). Patients who had recent or frequent consultations with their primary care physician were more likely to receive the influenza vaccine (32, 35, 43, 47, 51, 52, 54, 60, 67, 68). Vaccinated patients reported visiting their general practitioner on average 2.5 times more in the previous year compared to their non-vaccinated counterparts (54). An increase in vaccination coverage was also observed among individuals with a longer duration of diabetes (43, 54, 58, 64, 67). Olatunbosun et al. found that study participants with diabetes for 6–10 years were 4.3 times more likely to be vaccinated than those diagnosed for 5 years or less (64). There was a positive association between the number of medications prescribed to an individual and vaccination rates, with vaccinated individuals taking more medications for their diabetes or other conditions than those who were not vaccinated (32, 46). Moreover, a history of influenza (54, 62), or pneumococcal vaccine (35, 54), significantly increased the likelihood of vaccination. Lastly, a family history of diabetes was linked to higher vaccination rates (38). Figure 5 Figure 5. Clinical factors associated with an increase or a decrease in influenza vaccination. 3.6.4 Biases encountered Several biases have been identified in studies examining the determinants of influenza vaccination among individuals with diabetes, with some overlaps seen in studies on vaccination coverage. Primarily, utilizing questionnaires for data collection introduced memory bias, non-response bias, and social-desirability bias (51, 52, 54, 60, 64, 67). Additionally, a notable issue in some studies was the lack of distinction between T1D and T2D (51, 60, 65). This oversight was significant given the distinct characteristics of T1D and T2D populations, especially concerning age. Consequently, the potential differences in vaccination barriers and motivators between younger and older individuals were not adequately explored, leading to biased interpretations of the results. Moreover, the study populations often did not represent the general diabetic population well, limiting the generalizability of the findings to all individuals with diabetes (60, 62, 64, 66). Finally, it is crucial to recognize that the decision to get vaccinated is dynamic, subject to change over time within an individual (54). Conducting studies on this topic is complex, as vaccination adherence is shaped by an individual’s perceptions, as well as by psychosocial and motivational factors. 3.6.5 Empowering influenza vaccination through education: the key role of pharmacists Six studies highlighted the importance of education in increasing vaccination coverage among people with diabetes (69–74). Firstly, one notable study by Altay et al. demonstrated that patient education significantly boosted influenza vaccination rates across various age groups, increasing from 12.1 to 36.6% (73). Another significant study by Tao et al. involved a comprehensive community-based approach, encompassing 1,538 diabetic patients. This study used general practitioners to conduct educational interventions, resulting in an increase in vaccination rates within the intervention group, from 29.0 to 45.8% (74). Secondly, four studies assessing the role of pharmacists in promoting influenza vaccination among individuals with diabetes were included. First study showed that 41.7% of patients without a prior record of influenza vaccination received the vaccine within a 12-month evaluation period, facilitated through personalized diabetes education and medication consultations by pharmacists (71). Similarly, Fera et al. documented an increase in vaccination rates from 43 to 61% following the engagement of community pharmacists, who had undergone a diabetes certification program and provided scheduled consultations and health monitoring (70). This trend was echoed in another study, which witnessed a significant rise in vaccination rates from 52 to 77%, attributed to comparable interventions by community pharmacists (72). Additionally, Miller et al. adopted a novel strategy by utilizing pharmacy students to deliver educational interventions to patients, significantly increasing the percentage of patients comfortable with receiving the H1N1 influenza vaccine from a pharmacist from 69.3 to 81.4% (69). 4 Discussion Effective management and reduction of influenza infections in people with diabetes depends on the uptake of the influenza vaccine. Significant advancements have been achieved in the development of vaccines that are safe and effective. However, having these vaccines is not enough. Implementing vaccination programs for these people involves overcoming challenges such as logistics concerns, cost, and equitable distribution, alongside promoting vaccine acceptance within the diabetes community. An increasing hesitancy towards vaccination in people with diabetes pose significant obstacles to global efforts aimed at mitigating the spread and impact of influenza among this at-risk group. This review aims to highlight the inadequacy of influenza vaccination in people with diabetes, despite international recommendations. It provides insights into vaccination coverage worldwide and explored factors affecting uptake in people with diabetes, thus enabling further measures to be identified to improve vaccination coverage in this population. Nevertheless, this review has several limitations. Firstly, selection criteria were limited to studies published in English or French, due to the language proficiency of the readers. This language restriction led to the exclusion of a total of 24 of the original 357 studies identified by the searching equation. Among these, only minority could have been considered eligible for inclusion in this review. Thus, although including all identified studies regardless of language would have been ideal for a comprehensive analysis, the final impact on the results of this review is likely to be limited given the small proportion of potentially relevant studies that were excluded. Secondly, the origin countries of the included studies were categorized according to the six regions defined by the WHO to provide a framework consistent with global health divisions that may influence regional public health strategies, as each region has a WHO office focusing on disease prevention and control strategies. However, it is important to acknowledge that within these WHO regions, countries may face unique challenges regarding influenza vaccination influenced by economic, cultural, and systemic factors. Thirdly, this review may be subject to publication bias. While countries like Spain and the United States are well-represented, others with significant contributions to vaccine policies, such as Portugal are missing. Notably, Portugal was one of the first countries to introduce vaccination by pharmacists in 2007 (75, 76). Fourthly, the included studies addressing vaccination recommendations were all North American, leading to an underrepresentation of other regions of the world and thus a poor view of international recommendations. Fifthly, while figures highlighted the number of studies addressing the different determinants of vaccination, a presentation involving the number of people associated with each determinant would have seemed more appropriate to have a more comprehensive picture. However, the representation of the number of subjects could have suggested that a quantitative analysis was carried out, which is not the case, and would have not been consistent with the aim of a scoping review. Finally, the potential methodological heterogeneity of the included studies, due to the lack of a systematic quality assessment, could affect the interpretation and reliability of the findings. This review found that the recommendation for influenza vaccination applied to people with T1D or T2D, starting from the age of 6 months. However, only North American studies were identified, suggesting a need for more geographically diverse research (20–23). Across the Atlantic, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also recommends yearly influenza vaccination for people with chronic medical conditions, including diabetes, as part of a broader strategy to safeguard those most susceptible to severe influenza (77). The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK holds a similar position, advising that adults with conditions such as diabetes receive the influenza vaccine each year (78). Likewise, France recommends influenza vaccination annually for people with diabetes (79, 80), while in Australia, the government provides the influenza vaccine free of charge to high-risk groups including people with diabetes (81). These recommendations from major health organizations globally underscore the crucial role of influenza vaccination in protecting people with diabetes. However, despite these guidelines, there is still considerable variation in vaccination rates in people with diabetes, indicating a pressing need for intensified public health initiatives to enhance vaccine uptake. Results presented in this review highlighted several benefits of influenza vaccination in people with diabetes. They suggested that the vaccine significantly decreased rates of all-cause mortality and hospitalizations, including specific reductions in influenza and pneumonia hospitalizations (24–30). These findings align with earlier evidence of the influenza vaccine’s effectiveness in diabetic populations, notably a study by Colquhoun et al. that reported a 79% reduction in hospital admissions for vaccinated diabetic patients compared to their non-vaccinated peers across two influenza seasons (82). However, several biases common to most studies on the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in people with diabetes were identified, the main one being the healthy vaccinee bias (24). This bias is also reported and described in other studies and can lead to an overestimation of the benefits attributed to influenza vaccination (83–85). Another significant bias identified was related to the pneumococcal vaccination status. It was noted that a majority of individuals vaccinated against influenza had also received the pneumococcal vaccine (25). Consequently, some of the benefits attributed to influenza vaccination may have been due to the pneumococcal vaccine (86, 87). Moreover, there was frequently no differentiation made between T1D and T2D in studies included. This oversight introduced an additional layer of bias, as individuals with T2D, who often have several comorbidities, are more susceptible to complications after an influenza infection (25–27). Despite existing recommendations advocating for influenza vaccination in people with diabetes, coverage rates remained low in numerous regions. The heterogeneity observed in reported results can be attributed to various factors, including differing study inclusion criteria, demographic considerations, and the specific years in which studies were conducted. Few studies reported vaccination coverage rates meeting or exceeding the 75% target set by the WHO for this population (16). In Europe, the Netherlands achieved an 85% coverage rate in 1999 (44), yet witnessed a decline to 75% by 2013 (45). Spain (47–56), and Belgium (40–42), showed considerable fluctuations in their vaccination rates, whereas Poland (46), and Austria (39), reported notably lower figures. In the Americas, coverage in the United States ranged between 49 and 62% (33–37), while Brazil displayed a positive trend, reaching 59% in 2015 (31). In the Western Pacific, Australia and Taiwan had coverage rates of approximately 30–35% (58, 61), in contrast to China and Korea, where rates hovered around 50–55% (59, 60). The Eastern Mediterranean region saw Saudi Arabia reporting a 61% coverage rate (38). In estimating the influenza vaccination coverage rate, several biases were reported, largely stemming from questionnaire-based data collection methods. Social desirability bias may have inflated reported vaccination rates, as some individuals could affirm vaccination status to be viewed more favorably (47, 52, 54). Non-response bias occurred when the respondents of a survey did not represent the entire target population, potentially skewing results (52). Memory bias, particularly concerning recollections of past vaccination statuses, could compromise accuracy, especially for inquiries regarding distant past events (61). Furthermore, the under-diagnosis of diabetes in certain locales, coupled with inadequate differentiation between T1D and T2D, introduced additional layers of complexity to accurate vaccination coverage assessment (47). A range of factors that influence influenza vaccination rates among individuals with diabetes has been identified. These factors were categorized into barriers, motivators, socio-demographic elements, and clinical aspects, highlighting the complex nature of vaccine acceptance and adherence. One of the primary barriers identified was concern over adverse reactions (38, 43, 46, 54, 55, 59, 61–65), indicating significant apprehension. Additionally, self-perceived risk of contracting influenza played a crucial role in vaccination decisions. Diabetic individuals who rated their health status highly were less likely to get vaccinated compared to those with a lower health status assessment (38, 46, 47, 52, 54, 62, 64–66), aligning with literature that underscores the impact of self-perceived risk on vaccination rates (88). This emphasizes the need for adequate health education about the risks of influenza, especially for diabetes patients. Economic considerations, like the cost of the vaccine, also emerged as significant factors, particularly in regions where vaccination were not subsidized (46, 62, 64, 66). Furthermore, knowledge about influenza and its vaccine was critical. The spread of misinformation, lack of information, and misconceptions posed major barriers to vaccination (46, 62, 66). This situation underlined the importance of effective, transparent, and accessible communication strategies to address these barriers. Additionally, this review highlighted the importance of trust in the pharmaceutical industry and government health organizations. Vaccination rates declined following the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, a phenomenon partly due to healthcare controversies in France that eroded public trust in health agencies, including skepticism towards the influenza vaccine. Since the pandemic, a noticeable portion of the French diabetic population has been reluctant to get vaccinated (63). One study highlighted the significant negative impact of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic on French public attitudes towards vaccines, with 41% expressing a poor opinion of them (89). This skepticism is not unique to France but is evident across Europe, although recent studies indicated that vaccine confidence has been on the rise since 2015 (90). Physicians played a critical role in influencing influenza vaccination rates, with patients showing high receptiveness to their advice (38, 46, 47, 54, 59, 62, 64–66). By sharing their expertise and insights on influenza vaccination, physicians enable patients to make informed decisions based on scientific evidence and the latest health guidelines. However, not all physicians view the influenza vaccine as effective (91, 92), with one study revealing that 50% of physicians had not received the influenza vaccine in the decade prior to the survey (93). Importantly, physicians who are vaccinated against influenza are more inclined to recommend the vaccine to their patients (94, 95), although 10% believe their endorsement is not crucial (93). It is imperative that physicians, especially those in primary care, consistently recommend influenza vaccination to their diabetic patients. Further research is needed to understand the factors that motivate or deter physicians from recommending the influenza vaccine. Insights from such studies could identify ways to encourage physicians to recommend the vaccine, potentially increasing coverage among diabetic patients (92, 93). Regular visits to primary care providers were associated with higher influenza vaccination rates among diabetics (47, 51, 52, 54, 60, 63, 67), likely because frequent consultations provide more opportunities for vaccination discussions. Looking ahead, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of influenza vaccination. Evidence shows that vaccination rates improve through various methods, such as displaying posters in waiting areas or through discussions with healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses, and pharmacists) (96–98). Additionally, sending vaccination reminders to both patients and their physicians has been proven to effectively increase vaccination rates (96, 99, 100). Socio-demographic factors significantly influenced influenza vaccination decisions. Notably, advanced age was associated with higher vaccination rates, likely due to an increased awareness of the risks associated with influenza in older age groups (31, 32, 37, 43, 47, 51, 52, 54–56, 58, 60, 61, 63, 64, 67). Individuals with diabetes often received vaccinations against influenza due to their age rather than their diabetic condition itself (61). Indeed, several studies have indicated that diabetic individuals did not perceive influenza as having more severe implications for them compared to non-diabetic individuals (61, 64). Given these findings, reconsidering the age threshold for routine influenza vaccination could be beneficial (101). The impact of gender on vaccination rates has yielded mixed results. The review found that in Spain, fewer women were vaccinated compared to men (47, 48, 52), whereas in Korea and Taiwan, the opposite trend was observed, with more women receiving the vaccine (60, 61). One explanation might be that men generally have more comorbidities, making them priority candidates for influenza vaccination (67). This is supported by evidence suggesting that physicians are more likely to recommend influenza vaccinations to patients with comorbidities (92), a factor also associated with higher vaccination rates among individuals with diabetes in this review (32, 38, 46, 47, 51, 52, 54, 61, 67). Further investigation is needed to understand these gender disparities fully, but it is crucial that influenza vaccination promotion does not discriminate by gender. Additionally, this review highlighted an association between higher income levels and increased vaccination rates, pointing to economic barriers as a significant obstacle for lower-income groups (37, 46, 60, 66, 67). This emphasizes the need for strategies to make influenza vaccinations more accessible to individuals across all income brackets. Clinical factors played a pivotal role in the decision-making process for influenza vaccinations. Patients with comorbidities, especially those suffering from cardiac and pulmonary diseases (32, 38, 46, 47, 51, 52, 54, 61, 67), as well as those who frequently visit their primary care physicians, showed a higher propensity towards vaccination (32, 35, 43, 47, 51, 52, 54, 60, 67, 68). Additionally, a longer duration of diabetes was associated with an increased likelihood of getting vaccinated, possibly due to more frequent interactions with the healthcare system or a heightened awareness of health risks over time (43, 54, 58, 64, 67). It is crucial to acknowledge that biases such as memory, non-response, and social desirability, along with challenges in differentiating between T1D and T2D, may have impacted the outcomes of the analyzed studies. The dynamic nature of vaccination decisions, which can evolve over time, adds another layer of complexity to enhancing vaccination rates. This review highlighted the critical role of education in boosting influenza vaccination coverage among individuals with diabetes. This aligns with prior research emphasizing education as a key element in fostering adherence to preventive healthcare practices (102, 103). Studies by Altay et al. and Tao et al. demonstrated the positive effect of patient education on vaccination rates, supporting the notion that increased knowledge and understanding of vaccination benefits and safety can markedly improve vaccine acceptance and uptake (73, 74). Furthermore, the involvement of pharmacists, as evidenced by four studies, underscored the value of a multidisciplinary healthcare team approach to elevate vaccination rates. The integration of pharmacists into diabetes care teams, offering personalized education and medication consultations, highlighted their vital role in enhancing patient education. This has not only boosted patient comfort and confidence in vaccinations, but has also underscored the importance of pharmacists’ active participation in vaccine advocacy (69, 70). In many countries, pharmacists have been granted the authority to administer influenza vaccinations, a move aimed at supporting physicians and enhancing vaccination rates (104, 105). Over recent years, pharmacists have significantly transformed their role, emerging as key figures within the public health domain (106). The decision to allow pharmacy-based influenza vaccinations has correlated with increased vaccination uptake, a trend that has strengthened over time (107–112). This rise in vaccination rates can be attributed to several advantages associated with community pharmacies. Firstly, the convenience of community pharmacies has been widely acknowledged (113–115). As the most accessible healthcare professionals, pharmacists often serve as the first point of contact for healthcare inquiries. Community pharmacies are well-distributed, covering both urban and rural areas where medical services may be less accessible, and they tend to have flexible operating hours (116, 117). This accessibility is particularly beneficial for increasing vaccination rates among individuals who might not typically seek vaccination (117). Additionally, community pharmacies are well-positioned to target at-risk groups, such as individuals with diabetes, more effectively. Pharmacists can identify those eligible for influenza vaccinations through pharmacy records and patient consultations. Given that individuals in at-risk groups often visit community pharmacies to refill prescriptions, these visits provide convenient opportunities for vaccination (118). Papastergiou et al. found that 21% of high-risk individuals reported they would not have been vaccinated if the service were not available at community pharmacies (113). Moreover, satisfaction rates for pharmacy-based vaccinations exceed 95%, with patients endorsing the pharmacists’ new role (119, 120). The preference for community pharmacy vaccinations is not only due to convenience but also the perception of community pharmacies as less stressful environments with a lower risk of exposure to sick individuals (121). The COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the value of community pharmacy-based vaccinations, as concerns over exposure in traditional healthcare settings have led to a reduction in visits to primary care providers (122). Patients are reassured by the expertise of pharmacists and their capability to safely administer vaccinations, which aligns with pharmacists’ roles in educating and advising on vaccination matters (121). With the authorization to administer influenza vaccines in many countries, pharmacists are well-placed to help achieve vaccination coverage objectives set by organizations like the WHO. The strategic positioning and recognized expertise of community pharmacists make them essential players in vaccinating at-risk populations, including those with diabetes. Given the international emphasis on vaccinating priority groups against influenza, leveraging the role of pharmacists in this effort is crucial. 5 Conclusion This scoping review synthesized current insights into influenza vaccination among individuals with diabetes. To date few publications have focused on this topic. Despite international recommendations supporting influenza vaccination in people with diabetes and its proven effectiveness, coverage has varied significantly over time and by region but has remained low. Determinants such as being older, the presence of comorbidities, frequent visits to the physician, a history of vaccination as well as good knowledge of the influenza vaccine have been associated with greater vaccination uptake. Conversely, a good self-rated health status, poor perception of the risk of complications and fear of adverse events have all been associated with lower vaccination uptake. Healthcare professionals, especially pharmacists who are among the main initiators of patient education in healthcare, should increase their efforts to educate about and promote influenza vaccination in individuals with diabetes. Moving forward, a focused approach on these determinants and a global commitment to enhancing patient education may significantly improve vaccination rates. Such efforts are essential for better protecting people with diabetes against influenza.

Study: School closures due to seasonal influenza: a prospective data collection-based study of eleven influenza seasons—United States, 2011–2022. Image Credit: Inna Reznik/Shutterstock.com Background School closures are critical for avoiding influenza transmission and are often enforced ahead of time during severe pandemics. However, reactive, unforeseen closures occur every year during seasonal outbreaks. A study conducted in 2009 found that around 2,000 schools closed during the fall wave. Existing data underscores the necessity of identifying and managing unforeseen school closures during pandemics, which reflect nationwide influenza activity. About the study In the current study, researchers analyzed seasonal influenza-related closures in US schools. The researchers conducted a systematic daily web search from 1 August 2011 to 30 June 2022 to find public announcements of unanticipated school closings in the United States lasting ≥1.0 days. They selected those that listed influenza (Flu) and influenza-like illness (ILI) as reasons for closure. They analyzed ILI-SC temporal trends and compared them to reported outpatient ILI-related healthcare visits. They excluded coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related school closings. They extracted particular contributing elements from every ILI-SC announcement. The team described a multi-year trend of ILI-associated school closings in the United States from 2011–2012 to 2021–2022, focusing on the temporal and geographical relationships between ILI-associated school closings and regular surveillance information on influenza and ILI requiring medical attention at the regional and national levels. They additionally examined the pattern changes between data obtained before COVID-19 and data collected during the pandemic years. Related StoriesStudy reveals distinct genetic risk factors for influenza and COVID-19New project launched to accelerate development and accessibility of H5N1 mRNA vaccine candidatesWastewater surveillance detects influenza and H5 viruses from human and animal sourcesThe researchers analyzed two types of publicly accessible data: school information and the National Center for Education Statistics' Common Core of Data. They used publicly accessible information on district- and school-level characteristics from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core of Data (CCD) and the Private School Universe Survey (PSS), which revealed high coverage rates for conventional private schools. The researchers subsequently stratified districts by schools for ILI-SCs at the district level. The team collected publicly accessible surveillance information on seasonal influenza activities, including weekly US Department of Health and Human Services region-specific and national data on the percentage of medical provider visits in outpatient departments for influenza-like illness (ILINet) across the United States. They also collected national laboratory-verified influenza-associated hospitalization data for pediatric and adult individuals (FluSurv-NET) from 13 US states. They used descriptive statistics to examine the features, seasonality, length, and geographical distribution of ILI-SCs and their influence on school closures, comparing weekly occurrence patterns to seasonal influenza-related surveillance information. Results The study found that ILI-SCs occur annually in over 100,000 US schools, with the highest connections identified during influenza A (H3N2)-dominant seasons. These incidents generally occur in Region 4 of the United States Department of Health and Human Services and disproportionately affect rural and low-income populations. From 2011 to 2022, 2,077 school closures were due to influenza/ILI, with the most common reason being increased absence among pupils and staff owing to sickness. Over the 11-year research period, these occurrences resulted in an estimated 9,136 school closures, affecting four million pupils and 260,000 instructors. Before COVID-19, schools in rural regions were significantly more likely to experience ILI-SCs than schools in cities and towns. Schools with large student populations participating in the federal free or reduced-price lunch program had a higher closing likelihood. The timing of ILI-SC incidence nationally concerning outpatient ILI activity differed between influenza seasons. The highest connections between ILISCs and national outpatient healthcare visits for ILI occurred over the three seasons of 2016–2017 to 2018–2019, dominated by influenza A (H3N2). Truncation in the prior and succeeding weeks resulted in reduced correlations. In the two full school years after the start of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, 2020-2021 and 2021-2022, 235 schools were closed as part of 58 ILI-SC incidents. All ILI-SCs in 2020–2021 were caused by ILI or COVID-19, with the 2020–2021 school year having the longest ILI-SCs. Conclusions The study found that seasonal influenza and ILI school closures are uncommon, and early notifications might improve influenza surveillance. It offers situational awareness in real-time during severe outbreaks and tracks COVID-19-related closings of schools providing kindergarten through grade 12 education in the US between February 2020 and June 2022. A multifaceted strategy, including enhanced immunization, improved ventilation, and prompt adoption of nonpharmaceutical therapies, should minimize ILI transmission before significant student absences lead to late reactionary school closures. The study also found that influenza-like disease epidemics occur regularly in the United States.

In their current form, bat influenza viruses do not appear to pose a threat to human health. The bat species currently known to carry bat influenza viruses are not native to the continental United States, but they are common in Central and South America. Causes and public health implications Experts from CDC and Universidad del Valle (University of the Valley) discovered influenza A in bats during a 2009-2010 study in Guatemala. They first found influenza A in bats in little yellow-shouldered bats.1 Yellow-shouldered bat found in Guatemala. Photo credit: CDC/OID/NCEZID – Amy T. Gilbert. Bat influenza viruses have since been detected in some other species of bats in Central and South America.2 The discovery of bat influenza viruses is important for public health because bats represent a new animal species that may act as a source of influenza viruses. Influenza viruses are already known to spread and cause disease in other animals. Laboratory research conducted at CDC and elsewhere suggests that bat influenza viruses would need to change significantly to be able to infect and spread easily among humans. Risk of bat flu spreading to humans CDC laboratory research suggests bat influenza viruses would need to undergo significant changes to become capable of infecting and spreading easily among people. Therefore, these viruses do not appear to pose a risk to human health in their current form. However, CDC scientists cannot rule out the possibility that these viruses could eventually become capable of infecting humans. The internal genes of bat influenza viruses are compatible with human influenza viruses. That means it is possible that these viruses could exchange genetic information with human influenza viruses through a process called "reassortment." Reassortment occurs when two or more influenza viruses infect a single host cell, which allows the viruses to swap genetic information. Reassortment facts‎ Reassortment can sometimes lead to the emergence of new flu viruses capable of infecting humans. The conditions needed for reassortment between human influenza viruses and bat influenza viruses remain unknown. A different animal (such as pigs, horses, dogs, or seals) would need to serve as a "bridge." That means that another animal would need to be capable of being infected with both bat influenza virus and human influenza viruses for reassortment to occur. Since the discovery of bat flu, there has been at least one study to assess the possibility of reassortment events occurring between bat influenza and other influenza viruses.3 So far, the results of these studies continue to indicate that bat influenza viruses are very unlikely to reassort with other influenza viruses. Preliminary laboratory research at CDC suggests that human cells do not support growth of bat influenza viruses.1 Difference between bat influenza viruses and other influenza viruses The bat influenza viruses discovered in Central and South America are very different from other influenza viruses in humans and animals. All influenza A viruses have hemagglutinin (HA) surface proteins. Until the discovery of bat influenza viruses, there were only 16 different classes (or “subtypes”) of HA proteins known to exist in nature. The new bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America are distinct from pre-existing subtypes. CDC scientists have classified them as new subtypes, denoted as “H17” and “H18.”12 The other surface protein-coding gene of bat influenza viruses, neuraminidase (NA), is different from that of known influenza viruses, as well. CDC scientists have proposed new designations for the NA subtypes found in bats: “N10” and “N11.” Learn more about influenza viruses‎ For more information on influenza virus biology and pictures of flu viruses, see Influenza (Flu) Viruses and images of Influenza Viruses. Impact on influenza virus evolution The discovery of bat flu has shed light on the evolution of influenza A, B, and C viruses. It is possible that many of the internal genes of bat influenza viruses are descendants of influenza virus families that once circulated more widely in previous centuries and that are now extinct, or yet to be discovered. Using a process called phylogenic analysis, comparisons between different bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America have shown that there is considerable genetic diversity between them. Some researchers concluded that in Central and South American bat populations, the bat influenza viruses may have as much genetic diversity as those found in the influenza viruses of all other mammal and bird species combined. These conclusions suggest that bat influenza viruses have been evolving in bats over a very long time, potentially centuries.2 How bat flu was discovered The discovery of the bat influenza viruses was made possible by field work conducted by the following: CDC's Global Disease Detection (GDD) Regional Center in Guatemala, in collaboration with CDC's Pathogen Discovery Program. CDC's Rabies program. Universidad del Valle in Guatemala. A total of 316 healthy bats from 21 different species were captured from eight locations in southern Guatemala during 2009 and 2010. Rectal swabs and tissues were collected from each of the bats. Videos showing how specimens are collected from bats in Guatemala are available: "Global Disease Detectives" and "CDC Global Disease Detectives: Clues From a Bat Cave." Swabs that were negative for rabies were analyzed by the Pathogen Discovery Program in CDC's Division of Viral Diseases to detect other pathogenic viruses. Initial viral screening determined that 3 of the 316 bats tested positive for influenza. All were from a single species known as little yellow-shouldered bats. The Pathogen Discovery Program was able to identify and sequence the complete genome of the new viruses using high-throughput sequencing instruments in the laboratory.

Richards/Flickr cc Share Copied to clipboard The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) recently reported detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in dairy herds in three more counties, including Ionia, where the virus struck for a second time at a massive layer chicken facility. In other avian flu developments, Minnesota and New Mexico reported their first outbreaks in commercial poultry operations for 2024.Michigan grapples with virus on 2 animal frontsMichigan reported its first outbreak in dairy cows on March 29, which affected a herd in Montcalm County in the west central part of the state that had recently received cows from an affected facility in Texas.In an April 12 statement, MDARD said the three additional herds in Michigan are located in three counties: Ionia, Isabella, and Ottawa. Ionia and Isabella counties border Montcalm County. Ottawa County is located on the western border of Michigan's lower peninsula.Officials didn't specify the suspected source of the virus in the state's three latest detections."What is happening with HPAI in Michigan mirrors what is happening in states across the country. This virus does not stop at county or state lines, which is why we must all be on high alert," said Tim Boring, PhD, MDARD's director. "This news is unfortunate and upsetting for our poultry and dairy farming families and communities."He said experts across the nation continue to assess the situation and are providing insights into the impact of HPAI on affected livestock.This virus does not stop at county or state lines, which is why we must all be on high alert.A day before the latest announcement, MDARD strongly urged producers to tighten all biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. "This is a virus that can easily be moved unknowingly on everything from farm equipment to shoes to delivery or service vehicles and the list goes on," Boring said.Earlier this month, the virus struck a large layer facility in Ionia County that housed more than 1.9 million birds, marking Michigan's fourth detection in commercial poultry since 2022.The latest updates from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) notes a second outbreak in Ionia County poultry, this time at a commercial table egg processor that has more than 2.1 million birds.More poultry outbreaks in 3 statesAPHIS also reported the first outbreaks in commercial poultry this year for Minnesota and New Mexico. Minnesota's outbreak occurred at a turkey farm housing more than 68,000 birds in Meeker County. In New Mexico, the virus was detected at a commercial hatchery in Roosevelt County that is home to 61,500 birds.Elsewhere, the virus struck another poultry operation in Kansas, this time in Grant County at a location that has 17,700 birds, according to APHIS. Earlier this year, the virus hit a layer farm and multiple gamebird producers.

They are more or less controlled because the different strains that cause them are not virulent enough – but that will not necessarily be the case for ever.”Details of the survey – which involved inputs from a total of 187 senior scientists – will be revealed at European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) congress in Barcelona next weekend.The next most likely cause of a pandemic, after influenza, is likely to be a virus – dubbed Disease X – that is still unknown to science, according to 21% of the experts who took part in the study. They believe the next pandemic will be caused by an as-yet-to-be-identified micro-organism that will appear out of the blue, just as the Sars-CoV-2 virus, the cause of Covid-19, did, when it started to infect humans in 2019.Indeed, some scientists still believe Sars-CoV-2 remains a threat, with 15% of the scientists surveyed in the study rating it their most likely cause of a pandemic in the near future.Other deadly micro-organisms – such as Lassa, Nipah, Ebola and Zika viruses – were rated as serious global threats by only 1% to 2% of respondents. “Influenza remained – by a very large degree, the number one threat in terms of its pandemic potential in the eyes of a large majority of world scientists,” added Salmanton-García.Last week, the World Health Organization raised fears about the alarming spread of the H5N1 strain of influenza that is causing millions of cases of avian flu across the globe. This outbreak began in 2020 and has led to the deaths or killing of tens of millions of poultry and has also wiped out millions of wild birds.Most recently, the virus has spread to mammal species, including domestic cattle which are now infected in 12 states in the US, further increasing fears about the risks to humans. The more mammalian species the virus infects, the more opportunities it has to evolve into a strain that is dangerous to humans, Daniel Goldhill, of the Royal Veterinary College in Hatfield, told the journal Nature last week.The appearance of the H5N1 virus in cattle was a surprise, added virologist Ed Hutchinson, of Glasgow University. “Pigs can get avian flu but until recently cattle did not. They were infected with their own strains of the disease. So the appearance of H5N1 in cows was a shock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to ObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The more the virus spreads, then the chances of it mutating so it can spread into humans goes up and up. Basically, we are rolling the dice with this virus.”To date, there has been no indication that H5N1 is spreading between humans. But in hundreds of cases where humans have been infected through contact with animals over the past 20 years, the impact has been grim. “The mortality rate is extraordinarily high because humans have no natural immunity to the virus”, said Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist of the World Health Organization.The prospect of a flu pandemic is alarming, although scientists also point out that vaccines against many strains, including H5N1, have already been developed. “If there was an avian flu pandemic it would still be a massive logistical challenge to produce vaccines at the scale and speed that will be needed. However, we would be much further down that road than we were with Covid-19 when a vaccine had to be developed from scratch,” said Hutchinson.Nevertheless, some lessons of preventing disease spread have been forgotten since the end of the Covid pandemic, said Salmanton-García. “People have gone back to coughing into their hands and then shaking hands with other people. Mask-wearing has disappeared. We are going back to our old bad habits. We may come to regret that.”Explore more on these topicsEpidemicsThe ObserverInfectious diseasesHealthMedical researchMicrobiologynewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyAnother pandemic is ‘absolutely inevitable’, says Patrick Vallance 25 May 2024What is the pandemic accord and why have negotiations been so difficult? 23 May 2024The Guardian view on antimicrobial resistance: we must prioritise this global health threat17 May 2024…… commentsWHO accuses Nigel Farage of spreading misinformation about pandemic treaty16 May 2024Rise of drug-resistant superbugs could make Covid pandemic look ‘minor’, expert warns13 May 2024Science WeeklyFrom birds, to cattle, to … us?

Organ samples from experimental AIV infections including brain, heart, lung and spleen on one slide, and liver and kidney on another slide were stained for influenza A-matrixprotein and analyzed with QuPath: Random trees algorithms were trained to identify the organs on each slide, followed by threshold-based quantification of the immunoreactive area. The algorithms were trained and tested on two different slide sets, then retrained on both and validated on a third set. Except for the kidney, the best algorithms for organ selection correctly identified the largest proportion of the organ area. For most organs, the immunoreactive area assessed following organ selection was significantly and positively correlated to a manually assessed semiquantitative score. In the validation set, intravenously infected chickens showed a generally higher percentage of immunoreactive area than chickens infected oculonasally. Variability between the slide sets and a similar tissue texture of some organs limited the ability of the algorithms to select certain organs. Generally, suitable correlations of the immunoreactivity data results were achieved, facilitating high-throughput analysis of AIV tissue tropism.

Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Depending on the surface antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), different HxNy-subtypes are defined3. AIV in birds can be further divided into highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) and low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV). While HPAIV infection causes severe systemic disease, LPAIV infection often causes no or only mild clinical disease, usually limited to the respiratory and/or gastrointestinal tract in chickens, respectively4. Influenza viruses have a high variability due to multiple mechanisms such as mutations (antigenic drift), and reassortment, i.e., an exchange of whole gene segments (antigenic shift)1,5. Due to this variability and many other factors, such as host species or host age, the tissue tropism and pathology of different AIV subtypes in different infected species are also highly variable6,7,8 and HPAIV infection is often associated with necrotizing lesions and lymphoid depletion in many organs4,9. Especially in the case of HPAIV infections in chickens, a considerable amount of viral antigen is often also present in endothelial cells10, contributing to the systemic spread of the virus4.In pathology, the viral antigen distribution is often assessed by immunohistochemical staining of the antigen followed by microscopic examination. This method allows for a qualitative assessment of the tissue tropism with identification of the different affected cell types in various organs (e.g., parenchymal, endothelial or immune cells), the preference for a specific localization inside the cells (e.g., nuclear or cytoplasmic) in these organs and the examination of their association with lesions such as necrosis11. Also, immunohistochemistry detects viral antigens (i.e., proteins), thus enabling conclusions about the active virus replication in specific cells. In addition, RT-PCR data are influenced by viruses circulating in the blood that do not represent organ infection per se. Immunohistochemistry is often used as a valuable supplementation for these analyses to further elucidate AIV tissue tropism and in vivo pathogenesis. Furthermore, a semiquantitative score is often applied to facilitate a comparison between different viruses and animals8. Both of these methods are relatively time-consuming and thus often only a small number of animals are examined. This in turn limits the statistical analysis of the collected data.In contrast, digital quantification of AIV antigen can enable automated, high-throughput analysis of tissue tropism. The advantages of automated analysis, in addition to reduced workload, include consistency of assessment and the ability to measure and/or count many structures not only in representatively chosen areas of the slides but on whole slide images and for a large number of samples12,13. However, there are limitations to computer-based analysis regarding the complexity of the task as well as the variability and quality of the slides analyzed12,13,14.QuPath is an open-source software specially designed for whole slide image analysis, which provides a large number of tools for slide assessment and has many options for integrating different steps of analysis in one workflow, thus enabling largely automated image analysis15.This study aimed to create and validate a method for automated analysis of tissue samples, detecting and quantifying influenza virus antigen, enable a high-throughput evaluation of tissue samples, and reduce the associated workload for the examining pathologists. Automated organ selection was established as a first step since such studies often strive to examine many different tissues and therefore, a histopathologic slide frequently contains samples of multiple different organs. As often only a subset of organs is subjected to and fit for specific analyses, the presence of additional tissue samples on one slide was used in this study to assess possible limitations of the automated organ selection. In the second step, the immunoreactive area was quantified by applying threshold-based pixel classifiers in the respective organ regions selected in the first step.Material and methodsAIV infection experimentsFor the training and validation of the algorithms and the threshold-based antigen quantification, organ samples from multiple AIV infection studies (studies 1–3) conducted at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI; Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany) were used. In these studies, approximately 6-week-old white leghorn chickens from Lohmann Animal Health (Cuxhaven, Germany) were inoculated with 12 different AIVs either oculonasally (studies 1, 2, 3) with 0.2 ml containing 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) per bird, or intravenously (study 3) with 0.1 ml of 1:10 diluted allantoic fluid16, according to WOAH/OIE recommendations17, and died or were euthanized after inhalation of Isoflurane® (CP-Pharma, Germany) at 1–4 days post inoculation (dpi). Seven non-infected chickens were used as a negative control group. All experiments were approved by the State Office of Agriculture, Food Safety and Fishery in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany (LALLF M-V, registration numbers LALLF MV 7221.3-1-060/17 and 7221.3–1.1-051-12) and performed in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations, as well as in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.Histology and immunohistochemistryAnimals were necropsied under biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) conditions following standard procedures. Organ samples of the brain, heart, lung, spleen, liver, and kidney, as well as multiple other organs (skin, nasal cavity, trachea, thymus, glandular stomach, gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, caecum, pancreas, and bursa fabricii), were taken, fixed in 4% neutral-buffered formaldehyde for > 7 days, processed and embedded in paraffin wax. For the study groups, one paraffin block (block A) contained brain, heart, lung, and spleen and another block (block B) contained liver, kidney, glandular stomach, gizzard, thymus, and trachea. 4–5 µm microtome slices were mounted on glass slides. Immunohistochemical examination was conducted with the avidin–biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method (Vectastain PK-6100; Vector Laboratories, Newark, CA, USA) with citric buffer pretreatment (pH 6.0), a primary monoclonal mouse antibody targeting an epitope of the influenza A matrixprotein (ATCC clone HB-64, 1:100), a secondary biotinylated goat-anti-mouse IgG (BA-9200, Vector Laboratories, Newark, USA, 1:200), 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol (AEC) as chromogen (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA and Nichirei Biosciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan), and hematoxylin counterstain as done before18,19. Controls included validated positive and negative archival tissues19, as well as replacement of the primary antibody with an anti-isotype IgG antibody.Setup for image analysisBefore scanning, the slides were checked for artifacts such as dust, contaminants, severe tissue folds, or air bubbles. If present, these were minimized as much as possible, with the aim of keeping artifacts to less than 0.5% of the organ area. Slides were scanned using the AxioScan 7 with ZEN blue software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany), a 20 × objective with a numeric aperture of 0.45 and a pixel size of the scanned slides of 0.1725 × 0.1725 µm (detailed settings see Supplementary Table S1) and stored via ZEN data storage (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). Image analysis was conducted with QuPath v0.2.315 on desktop computers with at least 16 GB RAM and a 3.30 GHz processor and monitors with at least 59.8 Hz/1920 × 1080.First, one training set consisting of 21 animals and one test set consisting of 12 animals was selected from the chickens of studies 1 and 2. The 15 chickens of study 3 were used as a validation set, as they were independent of the chickens of studies 1 and 2.Automated selection of organsIn short, two separate classifiers were trained for the automated organ selection on the immunohistochemical tissue sections using the “object classification” tools: one for block A/slide A to select the brain, heart, lung, and spleen and one for block B/slide B to select the liver and kidney among other tissue samples, which were present on slide B, but not used for quantitative analysis. For a short overview of the training and evaluation of the classifiers, see Supplementary Fig. S1, for a detailed workflow see Supplementary Figs. S2–S6.For training of the classifiers, representative regions of the different organs were manually annotated on the slides of the training set and sometimes of the test set. Classes used for the annotations were brain, heart, lung, spleen, and background, including clear space and artifacts, for slide A, and liver, kidney, and background, including clear space, artifacts, and other organs present on the slide, for slide B. Furthermore, for training and evaluation, slides of the training set and test set were divided into tiles of 1000 × 1000 µm using the “Create tiles” tool. Of these created tiles, one tile for each organ and one tile for the background were selected randomly using Microsoft Excel (Version 2108, Microsoft 365) and annotated at 6× display magnification and the rest of the tiles were discarded (Supplementary Fig. S2). This was done for 12 randomly selected animals of the training set and all 12 animals of the test set. For 7 animals of the validation set, one 1000 × 1000 µm tile was manually annotated for evaluation, likewise. Additionally, on all slides of all sets a rough outline of each organ was manually annotated at 1–2× display magnification for evaluation purposes.Stain vectors were set via the “Estimate stain vectors” tool based on one slide from study 1, and stain vectors were then transferred to all other slides (Supplementary Table S2). Subsequently, the “SLIC superpixel segmentation” tool was used on the whole slides to create multiple small sub-regions consisting of similar pixels. Intensity features were then calculated for each superpixel (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).Using the annotations of representative regions and tiles in the training set, a set of initial classifiers was trained via the “Train object classifier” tool. All trained classifiers were random trees classifiers and default settings for features were used, as they were found to work best in visual pre-evaluation. These initial classifiers were then applied to all slides of the training set as well as the test set, each consisting of animals from studies 1 and 2, to assess performance on slides known to the classifier as well as on slides unknown, but originating from the same studies. This resulted in one class being assigned to each superpixel (Supplementary Fig. S3).The classification of the superpixels was then transformed into larger annotations for each class using the “Tile classifications to annotations” tool. Annotations and holes in annotations smaller than 1,000,000 µm2 were removed via the “Remove fragments & holes” tool to exclude smaller, falsely classified regions, resulting in one large, cohesive, annotated region for each organ sample (Supplementary Fig. S3).Results of the classification of the slides were then evaluated visually as well as using the 1000 × 1000 µm tiles and the rough outlines of the organs to allow for assessment at different levels of detail. For the tile evaluation, labeled images downsampled to a pixel size of 1 × 1 µm were extracted for each tile from the automated as well as the manually annotated slides. These labeled images were compared using the MorphoLibJ plugin20 for Fiji/ImageJ21 (ImageJ version 1.53q) to calculate the Jaccard similarity index (Supplementary Fig. S4). For further evaluation of the whole slides, the percentage of correctly classified tissue (e.g., brain correctly classified as brain) or falsely classified tissue (e.g., brain falsely classified as heart, lung, spleen, and/or background) was calculated for each rough organ outline (Supplementary Fig. S5).The initial classifiers trained with the training set were evaluated as described above and the best-performing classifiers were identified. These classifiers were then re-trained with the manual annotations from the test set in addition to those from the training set to further improve performance. These refined classifiers were then applied to the validation set, consisting of animals from study 3, as well as to the training set and test set, and evaluated as described above. Therefore, the performance on slides unknown to the classifier and originating from a study independent of the studies used in the training set and the test set was assessed.Threshold-based quantification of immunoreactive areaThe immunoreactive area was then measured using threshold-based pixel classifiers via the “create thresholder” tool in the selected organ regions (Supplementary Fig. S6). Organ-specific suitable thresholds for the AEC signal (immunoreactive area) were defined by visually assessing selected representative slides from at least 7 animals of the training set as well as slides from the 7 non-infected control animals for each organ (Table 1). A moderate resolution (1.38 µm/pixel) was chosen for the classification of the immunoreactive area. Those organ-specific thresholds were then applied to the respective selected organ region on the slides of the training set, test set, and validation set. The immunoreactive area was then transformed into an annotation with a minimum object and hole size of 3 µm2. The immunoreactive area and immunonegative area were then measured and the percentage of the immunoreactive area was calculated per organ. This detection of the immunoreactive area was done for the manually selected regions as well as the regions selected by the established organ classifiers.Table 1 Threshold for detection of immunoreactive area.Full size tableAs the immunohistochemical slides of the liver and kidney showed variable and often pronounced false positive immunoreactivity in peripheral regions, the margins of the annotations for the liver and kidney were excluded before the threshold-based antigen quantification. Margin width was chosen based on the estimation of the peripheral false positive area of the training set and the non-infected control animals, which resulted in a circumferential subtraction of 400 µm for the liver and 500 µm for the kidney. This was applied to all slide sets using the “expand annotation” tool.Creation of a coherent workflowAll the steps necessary for pre-processing, organ selection, post-processing, and threshold-based quantification of the immunoreactive area were compiled into one coherent script to enable unsupervised batch-processing of multiple slides with QuPath.Correlation of quantitative and semiquantitative analysis dataA semiquantitative scoring of parenchymal and endothelial antigen was conducted8. In short, the distribution of viral antigen was scored as follows: for parenchymal cells 0 = no, 1 = focal to oligofocal, 2 = multifocal, 3 = coalescing to diffuse antigen and for endothelial cells 0 = no antigen, 1 = antigen in single blood vessels, 2 = antigen in multiple blood vessels, 3 = diffuse immunoreactivity. For this study, the score was used as a parenchymal antigen score only or as the sum of the scores for parenchymal and endothelial antigen. Spearman’s correlation analysis was done with GraphPad Prism (Prism 8 for Windows, version 8.4.3, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) to compare the percentage of immunoreactive area with the semiquantitative score.In cases where the classifiers falsely selected no organ area when the respective organ was present on the slide, or selected organ area on a slide when the respective organ was not present, the pair of values was excluded.Cutoff value for immunoreactive and immunonegative organs, sensitivity, and specificityUnspecific staining and artifacts could not be fully excluded by the pixel classifier based on an AEC threshold alone without losing the majority of the true immunoreactive signal of the viral antigen. Therefore, an additional cutoff value was determined for the percentage of the threshold-based area to discern positive (i.e., displaying viral antigen) and negative organs (i.e., displaying no true viral antigen, but sometimes unspecific staining or artifacts). For this, the semiquantitative score described above8 was used as a ground truth as follows: If the sum of the parenchymal score and the endothelial score was 0, the organ was defined as negative ground truth and otherwise as positive ground truth. For the establishment of the cutoff value, the percentage of the immunoreactive area measured inside the manual organ selections was compared to this ground truth as follows: For the training set and the negative control animals, different cutoff values and the associated number of false positive and false negative samples for each organ were calculated using Microsoft Excel (Version 2108, Microsoft 365). One appropriate cutoff value per organ was selected accordingly and applied to the other data sets, including the slides with automated organ selection. As described for the correlation analysis, the pair of values was excluded if no organ area was selected for a present organ or organ area was falsely selected without the respective organ being present on the slide. The sensitivity and specificity were then calculated for organs of the training set, test set, and validation set, likewise.Comparison of immunoreactive area for the validation setFor the 15 chickens of the validation set infected with the same H5N1 HPAIV16, the percentage of the immunoreactive area was compared between the animals with intravenous and oculonasal inoculation routes at 2 dpi using Mann–Whitney U tests and between the different organs within one inoculation group using Friedman tests followed by Dunn’s post-hoc-tests with GraphPad Prism (Prism 8 for Windows, version 8.4.3, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Due to missing values, the kidney was fully excluded from the automated organ selection and subsequently only animals with a full set of measurements from all organs were included in the statistical analysis.RT-qPCRFor the animals of study 1, samples of brain, heart, lung, spleen, liver, and kidney (n = 94) were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), as described before22. Samples were homogenized and RNA extraction was done with NucleoMag VET kit (Macherey–Nagel GmbH, Germany) and KingFisher (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-qPCR was done using 1-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix for M1 (Quantabio, MA, USA). The relative virus amount (equivalent log10 PFU/ml) was calculated using standard curves. A Spearman’s correlation analysis and Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed to correlate the RT-qPCR data with the semiquantitative score and the percentage of the immunoreactive area, respectively, using GraphPad Prism (Prism 8 for Windows, version 8.4.3, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).ResultsEvaluation of automated organ selectionClassifiers for automated organ selection were trained, evaluated, refined, and applied. For the best-performing classifiers, the Jaccard similarity index was calculated for selected tiles, comparing the automated organ selection to a detailed manual selection. Tiles of the training set and test set were used for evaluation of the initial classifiers and tiles of the combined training and test set and the validation set were used for evaluation of the refined classifiers. For each classifier, a post-processing exclusion of regions smaller than 1,000,000 µm2 was conducted and compared to the same regions without this optimization. In most cases, the mean Jaccard indices were considerably higher for the post-processed organ selections than for the selections without this processing step (Fig. 1). Generally, the mean Jaccard indices of the slide sets used for the training of the initial classifiers, i.e., the training set, and the refined classifiers, i.e., the combined training and test set, were higher than those for the slide sets, which were not used for training, i.e., test set and validation set, respectively. With exception of the kidney and the background in the validation set, mean Jaccard indices for post-processed organ selections by the best classifiers were above 0.6 throughout all slide sets (Fig. 1).Figure 1Evaluation of organ identification using automated random trees classifiers compared to manual annotation. Mean Jaccard similarity index (0 = no similarity, 1 = full similarity) for different classes assigned by the initial (a, b) and refined (c, d) classifier algorithms compared to manual annotation in randomly selected 1000 × 1000 µm tiles.

Similar to the Jaccard index, the mean correctly selected percentage of each organ was generally higher for the slide sets used for training the classifiers than for the slide sets not used for training the initial and the refined classifiers, likewise (Figs. 2, 3). The mean correctly selected percentage was mostly above 65% except for the kidney of the validation set (Figs. 2, 3). In case of the kidney, only 11.99% were classified correctly (Fig. 3 f). Most of the misclassified organ area was classified as background or was left unclassified due to the removal of small fragments during post-processing. The mean percentage of the area of one organ, which was misclassified as another organ, was less than 5% per slide set for most organs and sets, except for the kidney in the validation set as selected by the refined classifier and the heart in the test set and validation set as selected by the initial and refined classifier, respectively (Figs. 2 b, 3b, f). In the case of the kidney, 10.59% were falsely classified as liver and 65.13% were falsely classified as background (Fig. 3f), and in the case of the heart, 12.71% for the test set and 8.05% for the validation set were falsely classified as brain (Figs. 2b, 3b).Figure 2Evaluation of initial classifiers compared to manual annotation for whole slide images. (a, b, e, f) Mean percentages of classes assigned by the initial classifier algorithms compared to a manual ground truth annotation of the organs for brain, heart, lung, spleen and background and liver, kidney and background, respectively. E.g., inside the manually annotated ground truth area of the brain of the training set, on average, 95.43% of the area were classified correctly as brain, 2.09% were classified as background and 2.48% were unclassified due to removal of small fragments during post-processing.

For evaluation, the same classifiers were additionally applied to the manual organ selections. The results of both analyses were compared to the semiquantitative score for parenchymal antigen only and the sum of the scores for parenchymal and endothelial antigen, respectively. Throughout all analyses, the percentage of the immunoreactive area showed a positive and often significant (p ≤ 0.05) correlation with the semiquantitative scores, except for the kidney in the automated organ selection, which showed a negative correlation (Fig. 5).Figure 4Results and limitations of threshold-based quantitative analysis.

In general, the immunoreactive area measured in both manually and automatically selected organs exhibited a similar pattern across different organs and infection routes: The IV-infected animals had a larger percentage of immunoreactive area than the ON-infected animals and brain, liver, and kidney had a smaller percentage of immunoreactive area than heart, lung, and spleen. For the automated organ selections, the immunoreactive area of the heart was significantly smaller in the ON-infected animals than in the IV-infected animals (Mann–Whitney U test, p ≤ 0.05). In the IV-infected animals, the immunoreactive area in the liver was significantly smaller than in the lung and heart. For the ON-infected animals, the immunoreactive area in the brain was significantly smaller than in the lung (p ≤ 0.05, Friedman test with Dunn’s post-hoc-tests) (Fig. 6a). Considering the manual organ selection, in the IV-infected animals the liver had a significantly smaller immunoreactive area compared to the heart, lung, and spleen. Additionally, the kidney had a significantly smaller immunoreactive area than the lung (p ≤ 0.05, Friedman tests with Dunn’s post-hoc-tests). The immunoreactive area of the six organs of the ON-infected animals differed significantly with the Friedman test (p ≤ 0.05), but no significant difference between any pair of two organs was detected with Dunn’s post-hoc-test (Fig. 6b).Figure 6Comparison of percentage of immunoreactive area for H5N1 infected chickens.

This was based on the measured percentage of immunoreactive area to distinguish “positive” from “negative” organs. Appropriate cutoff values were determined using the negative control animals and the training set with the manual organ selection. These cutoff values varied between the organs and ranged from ≥ 0.06 to ≥ 0.13% of the immunoreactive area. The selected cutoff values were then applied to the training set, test set, and validation set both with manual and automated organ selection and were evaluated using a semiquantitative score as a ground truth measurement for positivity and negativity (Tables 2 and 3). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the cutoff value were often suitable, but overall showed high variability.Table 2 Evaluation of cutoff value for immunoreactive and immunonegative organs—manual organ selection.Full size tableTable 3 Evaluation of cutoff value for immunoreactive and immunonegative organs—automated organ selection.Full size tableCorrelation of immunohistochemical data with RT-qPCRA correlation analysis of immunohistochemical and RT-qPCR data was done for samples of brain, heart, lung, spleen, liver, and kidney (n = 94) from the animals of study 1 (Supplementary Fig. S7). For the automatically detected percentage of immunoreactive area and the RT-qPCR data r was 0.4678 (Pearson’s correlation analysis, p < 0.0001). For the sum of the semiquantitative scores for parenchymal and endothelial antigen and the RT-qPCR results r was 0.5638 (Spearman’s correlation analysis, p < 0.0001).DiscussionThis study aimed to develop a method for automated quantification of AIV antigen in different organs to reduce the workload for the involved pathologists. Based on our experience, the manual semiquantitative scoring of AIV antigen8 in the organs chosen for this study takes on average approximately 30 min per animal. In this study, the manual pre-selection of organs with a rough outline took about 15 min per animal, with an additional time of about 2 min for the unsupervised automated antigen quantification. In contrast, the fully automated, unsupervised analysis took about 9 min per animal. For the (partly) automated analyses, quality control of the results requires a small amount of extra time, which was approximately 2 min per animal for this study. Nonetheless, the time needed for the involved pathologist is markedly reduced, as the digitization of slides and the starting of the automated analysis can be done by trained technical staff. However, the training of the classifiers and the selection of the thresholds requires some time. Hence, the method presented here might not be the method of choice for small studies with low numbers of animals. Although it was only applied to a limited sample size in this study, this method might be useful for the analysis of larger sample sizes, as the automated part of the slide analysis takes only a fraction of the time needed for manual scoring after successful classifier training.For most samples, the automated organ selection worked quite well, as was evaluated in detail for the small image regions with the Jaccard similarity index and for the whole slide visually and through comparison with a rough manual organ outline. The post-processing removal of smaller classified fragments turned out to be an important step for improving the selected regions. For some organs, particularly the kidney and the heart, the classifier-based organ selection was performing notably worse on the slide sets not used for classifier training (i.e., the test or validation set) compared to most other organs. Classifiers are known to often be limited by variability between different slides14,23. Furthermore, on the analyzed slides, multiple organ samples were present due to the design of the original studies and due to maintaining an efficient preparation and staining workflow. We found that the distinction of organs with a similar texture most likely presents a challenge to these classifiers, especially on immunohistochemical slides only stained with hematoxylin and the chromogen. On these slides, the organ structure itself is relatively low in contrasting colors as opposed to slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The kidney samples were often falsely classified as liver and as background. On the slide with the kidney sample, there was also a sample of glandular stomach present, which has a similar, tubule-like texture. As other, non-analyzed organs on the slide were labeled with the background class during training, this is most likely often responsible for the misclassification of the kidney as background. Therefore, to improve future studies, we suggest that slides for automated organ detection should not contain additional tissues not included in the analysis. In addition, the relatively similar structure of the brain and heart as well as of liver and kidney, respectively, probably led to the misclassification of the one for the other organ sometimes. This was mostly the case for slide sets not used for classifier training. Regarding the liver and the kidney, the selected organ area was further reduced by the automated exclusion of annotation margins due to the false immunoreactivity of some samples. These findings demonstrate the limitations of the automated organ selection for this study and should be considered in sample processing for further studies.Despite digitization with standardized settings, the brightness of the background often varied between different slides and organs. Therefore, a post-processing step of automated small-scale background exclusion was omitted and only background areas of a size of 1,000,000 µm2 or larger were excluded from the surrounding organ area. This might have led to a certain amount of underestimation of the true immunoreactive area, especially in organs with many small, air-filled spaces such as the lung. Nonetheless, variability of selected areas for quantitative analysis is to be expected to some degree, regardless of the post-processing. For example, the airways might be filled with a varying amount of edematous fluid or erythrocytes due to pathological processes or euthanasia- and/or preparation-related artifacts, thus influencing the measured area.To reduce the time required for the analysis, only one threshold was established per organ for measuring the immunoreactive area. Therefore, variation in staining intensity between different studies or batches of slides could affect the results, as a balance between true immunoreactive signal and background signal from other tissues must be found that works as best as possible over multiple slides. In this case, the validation set had a rather low staining intensity for AEC, which tended to underestimate the true immunoreactive area. In addition, in some slides of all sets, erythrocytes showed a false positive signal of low intensity, making it impossible to set a lower threshold. Furthermore, the resolution of the threshold-based pixel classifiers was set to “moderate” to shorten the analysis time, which may also have influenced the results of the antigen quantification.Emphasis should also be put on the slide quality, as artifacts such as air bubbles, tissue folds or dust can easily impair the digitization24 as well as influence the image analysis itself14 and may lead to a false positive signal, as the computer cannot discern these from a true positive signal with the same ease as the human eye. Therefore, it is necessary to critically assess the quantification results and ensure the quality of the automated analysis24.Spearman’s correlation analysis was done for automated and manual organ selection as well as for the semiquantitative parenchymal score only and the sum of the parenchymal and endothelial scores. In general, the correlation coefficients for the parenchymal scores were slightly higher than for the sum of parenchymal and endothelial scores, likely due to the smaller area taken up by immunoreactive endothelial cells compared to immunoreactive parenchymal cells. Furthermore, correlation coefficients for the liver and kidney were sometimes higher in the manual organ selection, especially for the validation set. This was probably influenced by the limitations of the automated organ selection regarding these organs.Especially for the heart, liver, and kidney, the correlation coefficients in some slide sets were considerably lower than for the rest of the organs and sets. This might be due to the relatively high presence of background signals or to organ-specific differences in scoring criteria.To further assess the additional cutoff value for whole organ positivity defined in this study, a larger scale validation is necessary, as the slide sets in this study show no equal distribution of truly positive and negative samples for all organs. Nonetheless, such a cutoff can give a quick overview of the organ tropism of different AIVs.A comparison of the chickens of study 3 infected with H5N1 HPAIV and inoculated IV or ON showed a tendency towards larger immunoreactive areas and marked involvement of multiple organs for the IV-infected animals. The ON-infected animals generally had a smaller immunoreactive area. Interestingly, the largest amount of immunoreactive area for these animals was found in the lung, suggesting a possible influence of the oculonasal infection route. To our knowledge, so far no major differences in histopathological lesions and antigen distribution between IV and intranasal infection routes have been described for H5N1 HPAIV strains in chickens and both inoculation routes caused a systemic distribution of viral antigen and lesions25,26. Nonetheless, a shorter mean time to death has been reported for the IV route of inoculation compared to the intranasal route of inoculation25,27.As immunohistochemical examination of AIV is often used in addition to RT-qPCR, we conducted further correlation analyses to compare these methods. We found a significant positive correlation between viral loads in multiple organs of the ON-infected animals from study 1 as detected by RT-qPCR and the corresponding immunohistochemical data. Although some studies have failed to demonstrate a coherent relationship between immunohistochemical and RT-PCR data28, our results are consistent with several other studies that have found a positive correlation. For instance, in ducks infected with H5N1 HPAIV29,30 or chickens and ducks infected with H5N8 HPAIV8. It is important to note that both techniques provide unique and valuable information contributing to a better understanding of AIV. For a fast and quantitative assessment of the overall amount of viral genome in an organ, including the intravascular blood, RT-qPCR is the preferred method. On the other hand, for topographic assessment of the relationship of the virus antigen to specific cell types and its association with lesions, immunohistochemistry is the preferred method11.In summary, the automated random trees classifiers correctly selected most of the organ areas, and a suitable correlation was achieved between the immunoreactive area per organ and a manual semiquantitative score. A functional workflow was created and successfully applied to slides from various experimental studies of avian influenza. A great advantage of the open-source software QuPath is its ability to create one coherent script to perform multiple, consecutive steps. This allows for an easy automated processing of multiple slides, thus providing an easy and fast method for assessment of AIV tissue tropism and reducing the workload for the involved scientists. In conclusion, we have explored a method for high-throughput analysis of immunohistochemically stained whole slide images. This method can be used as tool to characterize the tissue tropism of avian influenza viruses in future studies.

Vaccination is known to be less effective in people with obesity compared to those with a healthier body mass index (BMI), but St. Jude Children's Research Hospital scientists have found it is not obesity itself, but instead metabolic dysfunction, which makes the difference. In a study published today in Nature Microbiology, the researchers found switching obese mice to a healthy diet before flu vaccination, but not after, completely protected the models from a lethal dose of flu, despite BMI. We found that the vaccines worked effectively if at the time of vaccination an animal is metabolically healthy. And the opposite was also true: Regardless of what the mice looked like on the outside, if they had metabolic dysfunction, the vaccines did not work as well." Stacey Schultz-Cherry, PhD, corresponding author, St. Jude Department of Host-Microbe Interactions and Center of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response co-director Prior research has shown that when exposed to influenza virus, even after vaccination, 100% of obese mice succumbed to disease. Contrary to the scientists' original expectations, when mice who were vaccinated while obese returned to a healthy weight, outcomes did not improve. These now outwardly healthy mice still all succumbed to disease when exposed to the real virus. Only switching to a healthy diet four weeks before vaccination improved survival, with drastic effect, despite high BMI. "We were excited to see this effect because mice with obesity are so susceptible to severe disease and succumbing to the infection," Schultz-Cherry said. "Getting 100% survival with the vaccine where we had only seen 0% survival was impressive." The improved survival suggests the researchers have discovered a greater underlying principle determining influenza vaccine efficacy. Metabolic dysfunction hinders the immune system While studying how metabolic function influences influenza vaccine responses, the scientists found that poor metabolic health causes immune system dysfunction. T cells, the primary immune cells involved in anti-viral responses, failed to act in animals that had been in an unhealthy metabolic state at the time of vaccination, even during later viral exposure. Even when the animals ate a healthy diet after vaccination and maintained a normal BMI, the anti-flu T cells were "frozen" in that dysfunctional state. However, a healthy diet before vaccination improved T-cell function, which resulted in a robust anti-flu response during later exposure. "The T cells were better able to do their job in the metabolically healthy mice at the time of vaccination," Schultz-Cherry said. "It wasn't a matter of the numbers of them or the types of them. It was their functional activity. There were plenty of them in the lungs, not working. The healthy diet switched them from not working to functioning properly, but only if the switch occurred before vaccination." The earlier healthy diet also improved inflammation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in obese animals. Schultz-Cherry's team found that models also returned to a lower basal cytokine level when switched to a healthy diet before vaccination.

"We started seeing better signaling of things like interferons, which we know is problematic in obesity and in general saw the immune system starting to function the way that it should." Improving metabolic health may improve influenza vaccine effectiveness "What we found and are emphasizing is that it's not the phenotype of obesity that matters; it's really about metabolic health," Schultz-Cherry said. "It's metabolic health at that moment of vaccination that really makes a difference." The study was restricted to mice, but it does open research opportunities to improve influenza vaccine efficacy in humans. The findings suggest methods of improving metabolic health may also improve subsequent influenza vaccinations. Given the recent introduction of metabolic improvement drugs, especially glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, there may be potential for a cooperative effect. "We don't know for sure, but if the outcome of using GLP-1 drugs is weight loss and improved metabolic health, we would hypothesize that it will help," Schultz-Cherry said. "But we do know that we can do better protecting our vulnerable populations, and this study is a start for understanding how."

CDC continues to respond to the public health challenge posed by the outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, or "H5N1 bird flu" in dairy cows and other animals in the U.S. CDC Update April 19, 2024 – CDC continues to respond to the public health challenge posed by the outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, or "H5N1 bird flu" in dairy cows and other animals in the U.S. CDC is collaborating with partners including the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and state public health and animal health officials to address this emerging infectious disease using a One Health approach. USDA is now reporting that eight U.S. states have outbreaks in dairy cattle and that the virus has spread through cattle movement between herds and also from dairy cattle premises into nearby poultry premises and has infected a number of barn cats. However, only one associated human case to date has been linked with this outbreak in dairy cows and was reported by Texas on April 1, 20241. CDC's response to this unprecedented outbreak of influenza A(H5N1) in dairy cattle and other animals most recently includes: Supporting states monitoring people with exposure to cows, birds, or other domestic or wild animals infected or potentially infected with influenza A(H5N1) viruses. Testing for these people is being done by state or local officials using a CDC test, and CDC is conducting confirmatory testing when needed. Continuing to work in the laboratory to better characterize the virus from the human case in Texas. This week CDC completed susceptibility testing for influenza antiviral medications that are used for seasonal influenza (e.g., the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir). Testing confirmed that the A(H5N1) virus was susceptible to all commercially available FDA-approved and recommended neuraminidase inhibitor antivirals. Testing to confirm susceptibility to baloxavir marboxil, a different antiviral medication, takes longer and is ongoing. Studying human sera (blood) from people vaccinated against A(H5) to confirm that existing A(H5N1) candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) will provide protection against the A(H5N1) virus isolated from the human case in Texas. Manufacturers could use these CVVs to make a vaccine if needed. Preliminary genetic analysis had suggested two existing CDC CVVs would offer protection against the virus isolated from the human case in Texas. Designing an epidemiological field study and preparing a multilingual and multidisciplinary team to travel on site to better understand the current outbreak, particularly the public health and One Health implications of the emergence of this virus in cattle. Engaging One Health partner organizations from public health, agriculture, milk regulatory officials, and others to share information and ensure preparedness to prevent and respond to this emerging infectious disease threat and for any potential human infections. Monitoring emergency department data and flu testing data in areas where A(H5N1) bird flu viruses have been detected in dairy cattle or other animals for any unusual trends in flu-like illness, flu, or conjunctivitis. So far, these data remain in expected ranges, and to date, surveillance systems do not show any unusual trends or activity. This is a rapidly changing, emerging situation and CDC is committed to providing frequent and timely updates. What Might Happen The wide geographic spread of A(H5N1) bird flu viruses in wild birds, poultry, and some other mammals, including in cows, is creating additional opportunities for people to be exposed to these viruses. Therefore, there could be an increase in sporadic human infections resulting from bird, cattle, and other animal exposures, even if the risk of these viruses spreading to people has not increased. Sporadic human infections in the current context would not significantly change CDC's risk assessment. What Would Increase Public Health Risk Identification of multiple simultaneous instances of A(H5N1) bird flu viruses spreading from birds, cattle, or other animals to people or certain genetic changes in circulating viruses could change CDC's risk assessment because they could indicate the virus is adapting to spread more easily from animals to people. Additionally, if limited, non-sustained, person-to-person spread with this virus were to occur, that would also raise the public health threat because it could mean the virus is adapting to spread between people. Sustained person-to-person spread is needed for a pandemic to occur. Because of the potential for influenza viruses to constantly change, continued surveillance and preparedness efforts are critical, and CDC is taking measures to be ready in case the current risk assessment for the general public changes. The immediate goal is to prevent further spread of this virus between animals and people. CDC will continue to monitor these viruses and update and adjust guidance as needed. As a reminder, while CDC believes the current risk of A(H5N1) infection to the general public remains low, people with close, prolonged, or unprotected exposures to infected birds, cattle, or other animals, or to environments contaminated by infected birds, cattle, or other animals, are at a greater risk of infection. CDC has interim recommendations for prevention, monitoring, and public health investigations of A(H5N1) viruses. CDC also has recommendations for worker protection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the risk of exposure. Compliance with these recommendations is central to containing the public health risk. Additionally, unpasteurized ("raw") milk from sick cattle has tested positive for A(H5N1) viruses. Consumption of raw milk can be dangerous and is not recommended. The FDA has Questions and Answers Regarding Milk Safety During Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Outbreaks.

This vaccine could be effective against all influenza virus strains, even those having pandemic potential. Study: Influenza antibody breadth and effector functions are immune correlates from acquisition of pandemic infection of children. Image Credit: Africa Studio / Shutterstock Background Children are particularly vulnerable to influenza viruses that cause seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. Seasonal influenza epidemics not only lead to an upsurge in hospital admissions but also increase mortality rates in older adults with comorbidities. Many studies have shown that seasonal influenza vaccines provide limited protection against influenza viruses that have the potential to cause a pandemic. However, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (pH1N1) revealed the effectiveness of seasonal vaccines in protecting children and older adults from the infection. This protection could be due to cross-reactive antibody responses. Compared to children, adults possess additional immune correlates, such as T-cell responses and non-neutralizing antibody functions. This is the reason why children require higher concentrations of HAI antibodies for an equivalent amount of immune protection from the infection. To design a next-generation vaccine, it is important to identify immune correlates of protection. In the context of pH1N1 infection, HA-stem-specific antibodies play a crucial role in providing protection, which is mediated by the Fc Receptor (FcR) function. Some antibodies that can cross-react between pandemic, seasonal, and avian influenza viruses could reduce the severity of influenza virus infection. In this context, serum antibodies, particularly IgG, can facilitate effector functions, such as directing immune cells to kill infected cells, engulfing infected cells via antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADCP), and promoting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). These functions are mediated by Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) 3a and FcγR2a. Mechanistically, FcγR 3a and FcγR2a employ macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells to remove viruses-infected cells. Cross-reaction of ADCC antibodies has been associated with targeting conserved antigenic sites of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), the Nucleoprotein (NP), and Matrix 1 (M1). About the Study The current study identified several gaps in research regarding antibody effector functions. For instance, few studies have assessed the vaccine-induced ADCC changes, longitudinal durability of vaccine-induced antibody FcR binding and isotype changes, and the alterations in HA-specific antibody responses with vaccination and infection. The currently performed randomized placebo control trial (RCT) investigated the influenza-specific antibody breadth and function of seasonal (S1) H1N1 vaccination and pH1N1 infection. The antibody features, particularly HAI titer, from seasonal vaccination that could have helped in reducing or delaying contraction of pH1N1 were assessed using selected archived samples. These samples were collected from NCT00792051, a randomized placebo-controlled trial and its follow-up study that used school children between 6 and 17 years old. A subset of children who received any influenza vaccination in Year 1 (V1) or not (placebo-V0) was selected for secondary analyses, which helped determine the effectiveness of vaccination against pH1N1 infection. Study Findings The current study indicated that non-neutralizing antibodies are highly cross-reactive between different influenza strains and subtypes, which could play an important role in reducing the incidence and severity of infection. Related StoriesResearch suggests no need for yellow fever vaccine booster after initial dosePublic trust in COVID-19 vaccine science influences vaccine uptake in the USStudy reveals how COVID-19 affected the spread and evolution of seasonal influenzaDetecting antibody functions other than HAI is vital to developing next-generation vaccines. This study identified the serological correlates that play an important role in protecting children from pandemic infection. In 2009, when schools were closed for two months, H1N1 transmission was low. However, soon after schools reopened in September 2009, more than 50% of the students were infected within a few months. A very low community uptake of the monovalent pH1N1 vaccine has been documented. The half-life of different antibody subclasses alters significantly. The current study observed that seasonal vaccination enhances Fc effector functions of pH1N1 specific NP, HA, and neuraminidase (NA) antibodies. However, their function was short-term as it waned off within one year of vaccination. A greater antibody decline was observed in unvaccinated children. Seasonal vaccination did not boost FcR effector functions to other seasonal-specific antibody responses. Unvaccinated, uninfected children also exhibited increased FcR-mediated effector functions of pandemic-specific NA, HA, and NP antibodies. These children displayed a higher antibody level of NK cell function. pH1 antibodies against H3-HA responses were associated with cross-reactive avian H5-specific IgG, FcγR2a, and FcγR3a responses. This finding implies that cross-reactive responses are less focused and are not trained by seasonal virus exposure of other groups. Considering the experimental results, vaccination and prior infection are not associated with the lack of infection in unvaccinated, uninfected children or susceptibility of V1S1 children. More research is required to understand the host factors leading to these outcomes. Results also indicated that group 2 H3 HA-specific IgG3 antibodies are negative predictors of infection. However, seasonal H1 and pH1-IgG3 antibodies before infection were positively associated and, therefore, protected against infection. Conclusions This study shows how universal influenza vaccines, effective against seasonal to pandemic viruses, can be developed. Antibody breadth and FcR effector functions are two important immune correlates that could be exploited to develop this vaccine. Journal reference: Jia, J. Z. et al.

APHIS said manufacturers have expressed interest in producing vaccines for both poultry and cows."We will continue to engage with these developers to better understand their vaccine development, the efficacy of potential vaccines, as well as the cost of development and production," it said.Among other updates, APHIS said wild migratory birds are still thought to be the original source of the virus, though the investigations have found instances of virus spread linked to cattle movements between herds.APHIS also noted that there is similar evidence that the virus has spread from dairy herds back into poultry flocks through an unknown route.Virus hits commercial poultry in another Michigan countyIn other developments, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) said yesterday that tests have confirmed highly pathogenic avian flu in a commercial poultry facility in Newaygo County, which is located in the west central region not far where outbreaks recently struck dairy facilities and poultry operations. MDARD urged producers to protect their animals from wild birds and viruses they may be carrying as the wild birds complete their spring migration.Recent outbreaks were reported at two massive Ionia County layer facilities, and the latest poultry outbreak updates from USDA APHIS reflect a third outbreak in Ionia County, at a farm that has 2.4 million birds. APHIS also reported a second outbreak at a hatchery in New Mexico's Roosevelt County and infections at a live-bird sales operation in Florida's Miami-Dade County.

But, what is bird flu and what do we know about influenza in both poultry and cattle? Bird flu, also called avian flu, refers to infection caused by the avian influenza Type A viruses. In the wild, influenza viruses generally spread among migratory waterfowls, such as ducks and geese. Within avian species, domestic poultry are highly susceptible to infection with Type A avian influenza viruses, including H5N1. Canada itself is amid an H5N1 avian influenza virus outbreak, with over 11 million domestic poultry estimated to be affected and culled to date. In fact, a major concern for the Canadian poultry supply chain is the incurred financial loss from culling birds. This virus is highly contagious among domestic poultry and can spread through an entire flock within a matter of days. The most common route of transmission from an infected bird to a non-vaccinated bird is via direct physical contact or contact with virus-contaminated surfaces with bodily fluids such as oral mucus and feces. Bird flu in mammals Non-avian species, like mammals, can also become infected with the H5N1 virus. In Canada, sporadic cases of mammals becoming infected with bird flu have been reported in raccoons, striped skunks, red foxes, cats and dogs. As of March 2024, various reports from the USDA, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the presence of H5N1 in dairy cattle across eight states, of which Idaho, Ohio and Michigan are the most northern states bordering Canada. H5N1 is highly contagious among domestic poultry and can spread through an entire flock within a matter of days. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP-Charlie Neibergall Although there are no known reports indicating the current bovine strain has made its way into Canada, there is no doubt that it is getting too close for comfort. As of March 27, 2024, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has established various primary control zones in Alberta to prevent the spread of H5N1. The emerging bovine H5N1 virus is novel to the cattle industry, a backbone of the Canadian food and agriculture industry. The close environmental relationship between humans and cattle would seem to make both species more vulnerable to influenza transmission, but that is not the case. Interestingly, only a few cases of cattle-to-human influenza transmission have been documented. In contrast, pigs are the main mixing vessel for avian influenza A viruses, as exemplified in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The 2009 swine H1N1 virus was a mixing event that led to mammalian adaptation, a process that is not straightforward in any intermediate host. A natural mixing event in pigs would result from exchange of genetic material following co-infection with both an avian and human influenza virus. However, in the current scenario, the emerging bovine H5N1 strain that has infected American dairy cattle has undergone a specific adaptation in an enzyme called polymerase. Changes to this viral enzyme are concerning, as it could allow for faster adaptation and maybe even support cattle-to-cattle transmission. The proposed transmission cycle of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Pigs might be considered the natural intermediary rather than cattle. The current transmission chain is worrying due to a lack of information about this new host and its response to infection with H5N1. (Nitish Boodhoo) This raises numerous questions for which the answers are not yet clear. Among these, the key questions are: How are dairy cattle getting infected? Is viral transmission from infected to non-infected cattle, or strictly direct contact with contaminated surfaces or infected birds? Are cattle relevant as an intermediary in the transmission chain of Type A influenza viruses such as H5N1 from poultry to cattle, eventually infecting humans? The answers will support new regulations to control H5N1 spread within dairy cattle and to other farms, poultry, mammals and humans. The greater concern would be if this virus has entered the pig industry. Are there vaccines against H5N1 for humans and livestock? According to a CDC report, the H5N1 viral strain that infected a human in Texas is closely related to two candidate vaccines. It is also reassuring to know that the World Health Organization maintains a list of candidate vaccines that could be mass-produced against H5N1 influenza viruses. In fact, some countries maintain a small stockpile of vaccine doses against H5N1, should there be a need to vaccinate at-risk populations. Microscopic view of avian influenza A H5N1 virus particles. (CDC and NIAID) Until such an outbreak event occurs where vaccines against H5N1 for people might be required, the Canadian government has a list of preventive measures that people can take. Members of the public need to keep their distance and avoid direct contact with wild birds that look sick or have died. People should also avoid touching surfaces where there are likely to be bird droppings. As for livestock species, both the American and Canadian governments have been reluctant to approve the use of vaccines in the poultry industry. The long-standing strategy against avian influenza has been eradication, and not vaccination, by culling all infected and affected chickens. While it has been successful at preventing the virus from becoming endemic, it may not be economically sustainable with H5N1 outbreaks predicted to occur on a yearly basis. In the wake of this unprecedented news, efforts have to be directed to study avian influenza transmission from poultry into cattle. Such proactive efforts will hopefully generate necessary data to establish a decision-making framework to safeguard our livestock industry and protect human health.

A New Mexico poultry farm is the latest in a H5N1 outbreak of avian influenza, state agriculture and livestock officials confirmed Tuesday. (Photo by Jamie McDonald/Getty Images) State livestock and agricultural officials announced Tuesday evening a chicken farm in Roosevelt County was infected with avian influenza, following federal confirmation of samples. Every bird at the farm will be killed. Samples were first taken from the Eastern New Mexico farm on April 10, a press release for the New Mexico Livestock Board stated. It’s not clear if the infections in New Mexico chickens are related to the six confirmed cases of avian influenza in New Mexico dairies. Avian flu confirmed in NM dairy cows in two Curry County herds “We simply don’t know,” said Shelton Dodson, the spokesperson for the New Mexico Department of Agriculture. He further said the state is collecting and sending samples to federal officials to help trace the virus’ genome. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has not published an official reason for the “crossover” of the virus into cattle, but updated their initial findings in a report published April 16. “Wild migratory birds are believed to be the original source of the virus. However, the investigation to date also includes some cases where the virus spread was associated with cattle movements between herds,” the report stated. “Additionally, we have similar evidence that the virus also spread from dairy cattle premises back into nearby poultry premises through an unknown route.” It’s unclear if that case of spread from cows to poultry is in New Mexico. The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service declined to make anyone available to comment on Tuesday, but a spokesman said the federal agency would provide an interview to Source New Mexico later in the week. Dodson said he did not know how many birds were at the Roosevelt County facility, deferring comment to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Here’s what to watch for avian flu symptoms in backyard flocks and other domestic animals Avian influenza is often deadly to chickens, but all the birds on the premises will be killed, the release stated. Federal officials have separately confirmed that six dairies in Curry County have cases of avian influenza, called H5N1, since April 1. The most recent confirmed case at a New Mexico Dairy was April 10. The number of confirmed cases in dairies has grown, with now eight states. As of April 16, those states are Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Idaho, South Dakota, Michigan, Ohio and North Carolina. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have listed the human risk of infection from H5N1 as low, but that people who work with animals have higher risks. A Texas dairy worker contracted avian influenza after working with infected cows, on April 1, the second reported case in the U.S. The most prominent symptom was conjunctivitis, or a reddened eyes. The New Mexico Department of Health told Source NM that two dairy workers have been tested for HPAI, but both results were negative. Avian Influenza symptoms in birds The New Mexico Livestock Board urges Roosevelt County residents to watch for the following signs in their poultry Sudden death without any prior symptoms of illness; lack of energy and appetite; a drop in egg production or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; swelling of the eyelids, comb, wattles, and shanks; purple discoloration of the wattles, comb, and legs; gasping for air (difficulty breathing); nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing; twisting of the head and neck (torticollis); stumbling or falling down; diarrhea The New Mexico state veterinarian’s office number is (505) 841-6161.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.Fischman: I’m Josh Fischman.Lewis: We’re Scientific American’s senior health editors. Fischman: Today, we’re talking about flu. But not just any flu. This is avian influenza, or bird flu. It’s been sickening wild birds and mammals around the world, and it has infected people. Now it’s spreading among U.S. cows. But how big a threat is it to humans?[CLIP: Show theme music]Lewis: Bird flu may sound like an innocuous disease that gives sparrows the sniffles. But it’s actually quite a serious pathogen that infects farmed birds like chickens and many species of wild birds.Fischman: It can also infect other animals, and humans too. And sometimes, it can be deadly.Lewis: There are a couple of different kinds of bird flu. The one scientists are watching carefully right now is called highly pathogenic avian influenza A, or H5N1. In several bird flu outbreaks, the virus has spilled over into people who had close contact with the birds. It’s had a very high mortality rate in those people.Fischman: By high, that can mean around 50 percent. There was an H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 that sickened 18 people, six of whom died. It later infected more than 800 people, and more than half of those folks died.Lewis: Yikes.Fischman: Yeah, scary. The virus appeared again in China and several other countries in 2003. Another form of the virus caused deadly outbreaks around 2015 in Egypt and several countries in Asia.Lewis: Yeah, it was pretty serious. This latest version of the virus is called H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b. It started circulating around 2021 and soon spread throughout domestic and wild birds around the world, killing hundreds of millions of them.Christine Kreuder Johnson: We've been watching this avian influenza H5N1 sublineage for a while, because it has had many unprecedented tactics that we haven't really seen before. Lewis: That’s Christine Kreuder Johnson, professor of epidemiology and ecosystem health and director of the EpiCenter for Disease Dynamics at the University of California, Davis.Christine tracks zoonotic pathogens—that is, viruses or other infections that can jump between wild or domestic animals and humans. She was part of a pandemic warning project called PREDICT, funded by the United States Agency for International Development. The Trump administration shut that project down in March of 2020.Christine is a big advocate for One Health, an approach to understanding disease outbreaks that considers how the health of people, animals and the environment are connected.Kreuder Johnson: The epidemic trajectory in Latin America even further emphasized how unusual this virus strain is, in terms of its epidemiology.Lewis: Suddenly you had unprecedented cases of bird flu in marine mammals, including seals and sea lions.Kreuder Johnson: That really, for those of us who work in the wildlife health realm, was a major signal that this virus is continuing to change and further evolve.Fischman: Because of that ongoing evolution, H5N1 has made leaps into a wide variety of mammal species, including not just marine mammals, but land-based ones like foxes and bears and cats and dogs.Most recently, H5N1 has been detected in nearly 30 cattle herds, spread across eight states. Those states are: Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Michigan, Idaho, South Dakota, North Carolina and Ohio.Lewis: In early April, H5N1 was reported in a person in the U.S.—a dairy worker who likely had contact with infected cows. That person’s only symptom was eye redness and inflammation, or conjunctivitis, so not a full-blown respiratory infection, and they seem to have recovered fully.It was only the second time a person in the U.S. has been infected with this virus—the first was in 2022 in Colorado, in someone who had had contact with infected poultry.Fischman: So in both of those cases, the person was infected by direct, close contact with an animal, right?Lewis: That’s right—it doesn’t appear to spread easily between people. But that doesn’t mean we should be nonchalant about it. It’s definitely worrisome that it’s infecting so many mammals—including cows.Fischman: Cows make milk, which we drink. Is there a risk of people getting sick from milk from infected cows?Lewis: It’s possible, but unlikely if the milk has been pasteurized. We don’t really know if it can be transmitted via raw milk, but you should always drink pasteurized milk in general, because that kills harmful pathogens (including bird flu, experts think).Fischman: Raw milk is actually banned by the FDA. I mean big brands, sold nationally. But you can find some at farmer’s markets or other local stores. That’s where I’d be careful.Before I start panicking about another killer virus, at this moment, Tanya, how big of a danger is bird flu to humans?Lewis: Well, the CDC and World Health Organization both say that the threat to humans remains low, for now.I talked to Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, to get his take. He’s been involved in assessing potential pandemic pathogen risk for decades.Michael Osterholm: The risk assessment from both WHO and CDC remains low-risk for humans with this virus, and I support that. If you look at the cases that have occurred since 1997, when it really first emerged in human cases Hong Kong, through to mid-2015 to 2016, those years were by far the highest-risk situation. We’ve seen very few cases in humans since then.Fischman: That’s interesting. But couldn’t the virus easily mutate into something more worrisome? That’s what Christine was saying earlier. That’s how the virus that causes COVID got going. If this one did get going, how would we know when to worry?Lewis: That’s a great point. Yes, the biggest concern with avian flu is that it could mutate to start infecting humans more easily. But historically, most of the cases in humans have come from close contact with infected animals, not from human-to-human transmission.That said, the more this virus spreads in animals, the more opportunities it has to evolve into something that’s more efficient at infecting humans.Osterholm: The virus has changed—it’s mutated to the point of where it is infecting other mammal species and birds at an increasing rate. But we’ve had no evidence yet that that’s happened for humans or for pigs. And pigs would be the animal species that, to me, would be the sentinel that I’d be most concerned about.Fischman: Why are pigs such a big deal?Lewis: Well, pigs can harbor both swine and human viruses. In the animals, the viruses can swap components, and a pig virus can gain features that make it easier to infect people.Fischman: Okay, got it. So, if H5N1 starts showing up in pigs, we should be a little worried.Lewis: Yeah, that’s definitely something scientists will be on the lookout for. The viral sequence from the recent human case did have a mutation that allows it to spread more efficiently in mammals, but it lacked a key mutation that would enable it to infect the human respiratory tract more easily.If the virus does evolve to spread more easily from person to person, we do at least have vaccines and antiviral medication for flu. It’s not clear how protective the seasonal flu vaccine would be, but there is a small amount of H5N1 vaccine stockpiled.Fischman: I guess that helps me sleep a little easier. But just a little. Because I wonder: if bird flu—or any other virus—were to cause another pandemic, are we better prepared for it now than we were when COVID hit?Kreuder Johnson: That is the billion-dollar question, right? In some ways we are and in some ways we aren't. I think we still have a lot of growth to do in terms of how we can prepare and head off things. But I'm really, as always, impressed by our colleagues in the government who work incredibly hard to keep an eye on these things.Lewis: It all comes back to the idea of One Health—we need to monitor not just the health of humans, but also that of other animals and the environment. Bird flu may not be an immediate threat to humans now, but we shouldn’t get too complacent.Osterholm: At this point, again, the virus, as it is, I don't believe poses a major risk to humans. But that could change overnight.[CLIP: Show music]Fischman: Your Health, Quickly is produced by Carin Leong, Madison Goldberg, Jeff DelViscio, and by us. It’s edited by Elah Feder and Alexa Lim.

Learn More Transcript Transcript Unger: Hello, and welcome to the AMA Update video and podcast. Today we have our weekly look at the headlines with the AMA's Vice President of Science, Medicine, and Public Health, Andrea Garcia. I'm Todd Unger, AMA's chief experience officer. Welcome back, Andrea. Garcia: Thanks, Todd. It's great to be here as always. Unger: Well, let's begin where we left off last week, and that's with bird flu. Andrea, what updates do we have on that topic? Garcia: Well, that virus is continuing to spread among cattle, but I think the good news is there have been no new reports of human infection here in the U.S. There was some news according to the CDC that Vietnam has reported its first human infection with a low pathogenic avian influenza virus, that's H9N2. It's a different subtype of avian flu than the highly pathogenic avian flu that's most reported globally and that's causing the outbreaks in poultry and cattle here in the U.S. At this time, there is no indication that this human infection in Vietnam is causing person-to-person spread or poses a threat to U.S. public health. Unger: Well, that's good news. On the other hand, you did mention increased spread here among cattle, and that's obviously a problem. What is that looking like? Garcia: There was a report in Reuters that indicated North Carolina and South Dakota became the seventh and eighth states to identify avian flu in a dairy herd. And just as a reminder, when we talked last week, the USDA had reported infections across six states, so Texas, Kansas, Ohio, Michigan, Idaho and New Mexico. So now we're seeing dairy farmers across the country going on the defensive to try and prevent further spread. Many are banning visitors and disinfecting vehicles coming onto their land. Some are even cutting down trees to discourage wild birds from landing, since that first case in Texas and Kansas appear to have originated with birds. Many are increasing their safety and cleaning procedures. In that Reuters article, one dairy farmer described her farm as a gated community for cows, where only the most essential people are allowed to go since people can unintentionally contribute to that spread by carrying in contaminated bird droppings on their boots or on their vehicles. The good news is that, as we discussed last week, cows do seem to recover, whereas the disease is lethal in poultry. Unger: I never thought I'd heard that term gated community for cattle, but I understand folks wanting to protect their herds, and that's a big problem. So we'll continue to pay attention to this. Has the increased spread change the risk at all to people? Garcia: No. The CDC says that the risk for most people remains low. However, some dairy farmers are concerned about a potential drop in demand for milk and cheese due to fear. The USDA did report finding bird flu in some unpasteurized milk samples, but agricultural officials say that pasteurized milk is safe. Farmers are also isolating those infected cattle and dumping their milk. Unger: All right, Andrea, thank you so much for the update there. Let's turn now to another disease that is back in the headlines and continues to be for the past several weeks, and that's the measles. Andrea, what's going on there? Garcia: Well, two new cases, one in Las Vegas, the other in Los Angeles, have really put this disease back in the news. More measles cases have also been reported in Georgia and here in Illinois. Unfortunately, the cases in both Las Vegas and Los Angeles were found in people who visited popular tourist destinations that are often, as you know, filled with people. The one in LA reportedly visited Universal Studios and the Santa Monica Pier over Easter weekend. The one in Vegas reportedly visited the MGM Grand resort on the strip and then additional nearby locations. Measles on the Rise Measles has recently experienced a resurgence in many parts of the world. Learn about this significant public health challenge and what physicians need to know. Read on AMA Ed Hub™ So public health officials are warning that unvaccinated individuals who were at these reported locations during the designated dates and times may be at risk for developing measles within 21 days from that exposure date. Last Thursday, the CDC said that the rapid rise in measles cases in the first few months of 2024 threatens the U.S. elimination status. And that's a situation we haven't faced since 2019 when prolonged outbreaks posed a similar problem. Unger: Well, Andrea, where exactly do we stand in terms of cases? Garcia: Well, Todd, on Thursday, we saw the CDC release an analysis of measles activity. And that was from January 1 of 2020 to March 28 of 2024. That said that cases in that first quarter of 2024 have risen 17-fold compared to that mean first quarter average that we've seen from 2020 to 2023. As of the March 28 data cutoff for that analysis, we had seen 97 cases of measles reported to the CDC, and then as of April 11, we have a total of 121 measles cases reported by 18 jurisdictions. So that number is definitely continuing to increase. Of those 121 cases, 86 were linked to seven outbreaks, including a large one here in Chicago where most of those 61 cases that have been identified have been linked to that outbreak at a migrant shelter. If we look at the measles cases this year, though, 47% have occurred in children younger than five. Young children also had that highest level of hospitalization, at about 65%. And of people infected, 82% were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Of the 20 outbreaks, which we know involves three or more cases that we've seen since 2020, so far seven of those have occurred in 2024. And for further context, in all of 2023, we had 58 cases. And we are only in April. So maintaining that measles elimination status, which we know helps reduce cases, deaths and costs, means that no outbreaks have persisted for 12 months or more in a setting where we know the surveillance system is working well. Unger: So tell us a little bit more about this status. What do we need to do to help maintain the status? Garcia: Well, CDC has said that really comes down to increasing MMR vaccination coverage, especially in those close-knit and under-vaccinated communities. And as a reminder, that vaccine is incredibly safe and effective. We know that two shots are about 97% effective at preventing measles. I think the other steps include encouraging vaccination before international travel and then rapidly investigating those suspected measles cases. Most measles cases are still imported. However, of those, 61% in U.S. residents who were eligible for vaccination but were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. So the CDC is also reportedly seeing a shift this year in overseas regions where people were likely exposed. So during that study period that we talked about earlier, the two most common WHR regions where we saw cases were from the Eastern Mediterranean or the Middle East and Africa, but six of the 2024 cases were reported to have originated in European and Southeast Asian regions. So that's a 50% increase from earlier in the study period. So according to the CDC, along with under-vaccination here in the U.S. population, there's a global gap in measles vaccination that is also fueling this rise in cases. And if we look at those numbers more closely, first dose coverage declined from 86% in 2019 to 83% in 2022, leaving nearly 22 million children younger than one vulnerable to the virus. Unger: Andrea, besides this huge, as you point out, global vaccination gap, is there anything else that is kind of fueling this now? Why is it happening? Garcia: Well, in the U.S., some of it is driven, of course, by misinformation, which is causing parents to seek vaccine exemptions. Every year, that number of kids in kindergarten with measles vaccination is going down. Years ago, a fraudulent study claimed there was a link between the vaccine and autism. Of course, that study was later debunked. And other studies have searched for a connection but failed to find one. So to be very clear, there's no connection between the MMR vaccine and autism. So here's where physicians and particularly pediatricians can play an important role in curbing that spread of misinformation by talking to parents, being very clear about the evidence and the very real dangers and potential long-term effects of measles. According to the CDC, in the decades before the measles vaccine was available, 48,000 people were hospitalized per year. One thousand people developed dangerous brain inflammation, and 400 to 500 people died. Unger: So big risks there, and we need to close that gap. The evidence is really clear and getting those vaccinations, if you haven't already, so critical. Andrea, we haven't talked about RSV, COVID, and the flu and the array of other viruses for a while. The weather does seem, of course, to be getting nicer, thank goodness, it is here in Chicago, and we're now well into spring. Are we kind of out of the woods with viruses for the moment? Garcia: Well, it appears so. And according to a recent report in the Associated Press, which was sharing CDC data, the 2023, '24 respiratory virus season is slowing for all three viruses. Overall, respiratory illness activity is currently the highest in the central U.S. North Dakota is the only state that is experiencing high activity levels at the moment. The CDC gauges this activity by tracking doctor visits that involve a patient showing flu-like symptoms. And for that week of April 5, those made up only about 2.76% of all visits. The other metric, as you know, we look at is the test positivity rate for each virus, which can help inform which viruses are the most prevalent. While results are delayed for the CDC data set, flu has had the highest test positivity rate since mid-December. Hospitalizations, of course, give us that idea of severity associated with each virus. COVID is hospitalizing people at a rate of 2.21 per 100,000. That's the highest rate among the three viruses. However, hospitalization rates for all three viruses are declining. I think the key takeaway from all of this as well, activity levels are still elevated. We're seeing decreasing trends across each of these metrics, which do suggest that the season is waning. Unger: All right. Well, why don't we finish up then with that piece of good news. Andrea, thanks so much for being here and keeping us informed.

Lynda Schlegel Culver (R-27) to help protect domestic animals and the food supply against dangerous transmissible diseases. This passage happens as a rise in reported avian flu outbreaks in dairy cattle has been seen in several states across the nation. “I want to thank my colleagues in the House of Representative for their affirmative vote on Senate Bill 979,” said Culver. “When it is signed into law it will allow the Department of Agriculture to have individuals or businesses who deal in domestic animal, commercial feed, or pet food sales post on their premises departmental notices regarding dangerous transmissible diseases.” The bill will now be sent to the governor to be signed into law. Avian influenza has not been detected in Pennsylvanian cattle, but has been found in several western and midwestern states. Due to the rise in reported avian flu outbreaks in dairy cattle, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) is requiring any dairy cows coming into Pennsylvania from an outside state to be quarantined and tested for the virus. The quarantine only affects dairy cattle from any state where avian influenza has been confirmed during the past 30 days. Among other requirements, the dairy cattle may not be imported to, stopped off in or unloaded in Pennsylvania without testing of nasal swabs and milk. “I commend Secretary Redding and the Department of Agriculture for taking a proactive approach to the potential spread of avian influenza to cattle, which we are starting to see in other states,” said Culver. “A biosecurity plan is a great way to defend livestock from the spread of disease. We have seen how Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza – HPAI – decimated many poultry farms across the state during the last few years.” The PDA currently has the authority to issue quarantines and regulate the keeping of domestic animals to exclude or contain a dangerous transmissible disease. Culver’s bill would grant the department the ability to require any establishment in which domestic animals and feed are offered for public sale to post information about dangerous transmittable diseases.

A study from the Doherty Institute published in Nature Communications, delved into this very question: what is the impact of prior infection with an unrelated virus on the body's response to influenza? Using pre-clinical models, researchers investigated consecutive infections with two distinct viruses: influenza A (IAV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV), a mosquito-borne arbovirus which affects the central nervous system, particularly the brain. University of Melbourne Isabelle Foo, PhD candidate in the Kedzierska Lab at the Doherty Institute and first author of the paper, explained that the sequence of infection matters. “When SFV infection occurred first, it altered the body's immune response to IAV, resulting in worsened flu symptoms and poor health outcomes,” said Ms Foo. Indeed, the team discovered that infection with SFV followed by infection with IAV leads to severe damage to the lungs, increased inflammation and prolonged flu virus replication. They also made an unexpected discovery. “We found that when SFV infects the body first and IAV after, IAV-specific immune cells, usually found in the lungs, unexpectedly travelled to the brain. This really puzzled us!” she added. University of Melbourne’s Dr Lukasz Kedzierski, Senior Research Fellow at the Doherty Institute and co-senior author of the study, said these findings have significant implications for public health, especially considering that influenza viruses and encephalitic viruses often co-occur globally. “People are exposed to multiple pathogens at any given time, but immune responses to co-infections with different types of pathogens remain largely understudied, despite how commonly they occur,” said Dr Kedzierski. “Many cases of infections with arboviruses are asymptomatic and not typically considered a risk during an influenza virus infection. However, our study shows that a previous infection with arboviruses can significantly alter the body's response to influenza, potentially leading to more severe respiratory illnesses or weakening long-term immunity.” University of Melbourne’s Professor Katherine Kedzierska, Head of the Human T cell Laboratory at the Doherty Institute and co-senior author of the paper, emphasised the importance of considering co-infections when studying immune responses and designing treatments. “Understanding how prior infections with unrelated viruses can affect the immune response to influenza may help predict and manage the severity of respiratory illnesses and design effective medical interventions,” said Professor Kedzierska. “Our research offers crucial insights into developing more targeted and effective treatment and vaccine strategies to combat infectious diseases. “This study represents a notable advancement in the field of immunology and holds significant implications for healthcare professionals globally.” Peer review: Foo I, et al. Prior infection with unrelated neurotropic virus exacerbates influenza disease and impairs lung T cell responses.

First released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on April 1, 2024, the reported case highlights the emergence of this avian-origin virus in human populations, prompting immediate action and preventive measures. The infected individual exhibited eye redness, consistent with conjunctivitis, as the sole symptom and did not require hospitalization. Notably, there have been no documented cases of human-to-human transmission, offering some reassurance amidst the emergence of this novel strain. However, the CDC has issued interim recommendations for prevention, monitoring, and public health investigations, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures in containing potential outbreaks. Simultaneously, the National Veterinary Services Laboratory identified Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in a dairy herd in North Carolina, signaling the need for coordinated efforts between health and agriculture authorities. Collaborative initiatives between the NC Division of Public Health (NC DPH) and the NC Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (NCDA&CS) aim to safeguard workers and monitor for potential human infections. Despite these developments, there are assurances regarding the safety of the commercial milk supply, as products undergo pasteurization before reaching consumers. The FDA and USDA affirm that pasteurization effectively neutralizes bacteria and viruses, including influenza, mitigating concerns about transmission through dairy products. Dr. Terri Duncan, Bladen County Health Director, underscores the absence of reported cases in Bladen County, stating, “There have been no cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza reported in Bladen County.” However, local surveillance efforts, preparedness measures, and continued vigilance remain paramount. The collaborative efforts between federal agencies, state health departments, and agricultural authorities reflect a comprehensive approach to address the emerging public health challenge posed by HPAI A(H5N1) viruses. Regular updates from the NCDA&CS provide crucial information to stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making and proactive response strategies. As the situation unfolds, the CDC continues its close collaboration with partners to monitor individuals exposed to infected animals, reinforcing the importance of surveillance and preparedness in mitigating potential risks. While the current assessment indicates controlled transmission dynamics, the evolving nature of influenza viruses underscores the need for sustained vigilance and preparedness efforts to safeguard public health.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed on April 9 that dairy herds in North Carolina and South Dakota tested positive for HPAI, or bird flu. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development announced on April 12 three more HPAI cases were detected in dairy herds in three additional counties — Ionia, Isabella and Ottawa. The first detection in Michigan was in Montcalm County on March 29. In all, 28 dairy herds have tested positive for HPAI: 11 herds in Texas, six in New Mexico, three in Kansas, four in Michigan, and one each in Ohio, Idaho, North Carolina and South Dakota. South Dakota and North Carolina officials did not say if the affected herds had received cows from an earlier-affected state. The first herds affected by the outbreak in Texas and Kansas, announced by the USDA on March 25, are believed to have picked it up from wild birds, which carry the disease without showing symptoms. The positive herd in Ohio and the first positive herd in Michigan tested positive for HPAI after receiving cows from affected herds in Texas that were not yet showing symptoms. It’s not clear how the more recent positive herds in Michigan contracted the virus. Restrictions The USDA has not yet issued federal quarantine orders, but strongly recommends producers minimize the movement of cattle and test cattle for influenza before making necessary movements. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and 15 other states have placed various restrictions on cattle imports. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture issued a quarantine order on April 6 for interstate and international cattle movements. Dairy cattle coming into Pennsylvania from a state where HPAI-positive cattle were found must be tested for Influenza A five days before movement. West Virginia requires a certificate of veterinary inspection for dairy cattle coming from a state with a confirmed HPAI detection in dairy cattle in the past 30 days. The Ohio Department of Agriculture has not issued any movement restrictions or testing requirements related to the HPAI outbreak in cattle. Impact HPAI isn’t fatal in dairy cows like it is with domesticated poultry. More than 85 million birds in the U.S. have died from the disease or been culled to stop the spread since the current outbreak began in February 2022. Most infected cows recover with supportive care, although they may be dried off. The symptoms of HPAI in dairy cows are a sudden drop in milk production, producing a thick, colostrum-like milk, decreased appetite, fever and unusual stools. It’s still not clear how the virus, now deemed bovine influenza A by the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, is transmitted in cows. The primary mode of transmission appears to be from wild birds as they migrate. But there is also evidence to suggest the virus is being transmitted from cow to cow. Infected cattle shed the most virus in milk, but it can also be detected in the respiratory tract. There is no safety risk to the commercial milk supply as pasteurization inactivates the virus and sick cows are milked separately, as part of standard practice and in line with federal regulations. The Food and Drug Administration warned producers not to manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk cheese products made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness. The FDA’s longstanding position is that unpasteurized, raw milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious health risks to consumer Producers are urged to practice good biosecurity and update plans. The National Milk Producers Federation released HPAI-specific biosecurity recommendations that can be found here. Additionally, dairy producers who notice unusual clinical symptoms in their animals should contact their herd veterinarians. The Pennsylvania Center for Dairy Excellence is hosting weekly conference calls on Wednesdays at 1 p.m. to share regular updates on this evolving situation. The next call will be held on April 17 at 1 p.m. Click here to register or learn more about the call.

If you encounter a dead bird while walking or collecting trash at the beach, you should first notify your town’s Animal Control Officer for next steps. You should never attempt to dispose of a bird carcass without wearing disposable gloves, a face mask, and eye protection. Following safe collection with appropriate personal protective equipment, the carcass should be double-bagged prior to placement in a regular garbage receptacle. Please read the information below to learn more about Avian Bird Flu. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), commonly known as ‘bird flu’ was first found on Cape Cod in the beginning of February 2022, a little more than two years ago. While the disease does NOT pose an immediate health threat to people, it does spread easily among wild and domestic birds, including poultry. Here’s what you should know. What is bird flu? Can people get bird flu? I have a backyard poultry flock. Should I be concerned about bird flu? What are symptoms to watch for? How do I report sick or dead poultry in my flock? My pet found a dead bird and carried it in their mouth. Could they become infected with bird flu? Could they infect me or my family? What should I do if I suspect I may have been exposed to bird flu? I found a sick/injured wild bird on Cape Cod. Who should I contact? I found a dead wild bird on Cape Cod. Who should I contact? Key Takeaways Additional Resources and Information What is Bird Flu? Bird Flu is a disease caused by certain Type A flu viruses that usually spreads between birds, NOT people. Some of these viruses can cause serious illness and death in domestic poultry including chicken, ducks, and turkeys. Avian influenza A viruses have been isolated from more than 100 different species of wild birds around the world. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds and shorebirds (ducks, geese, swans, gulls, terns, storks, plovers, and sandpipers) worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Wild birds can be infected with avian flu viruses without getting sick. However, they can shed avian influenza viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Susceptible domesticated birds become infected when they have contact with the virus as it is shed by infected birds. Can people get bird flu? People rarely get bird flu, but when they do, it’s most often through prolonged unprotected contact (failure to use gloves, eye protection, or a facemaskespirator) with infected birds. People can become infected by breathing the virus in droplets in the air or possibly dust, or by touching surfaces contaminated with infected bird mucous, saliva, or feces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Most bird flu infections in people have happened after close, prolonged, unprotected contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces. No human bird flu infections have been reported from proper handling of poultry meat or from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products. Overall, the risk to the public from bird flu outbreaks is low; however, because bird flu viruses have been known to infect people sporadically (again, people who were known to have prologued, unprotected exposure to infected birds), it is possible that human infections with these viruses could occur. It is important to note there has been no known human-to-human spread of bird flu. CDC Infographic: How Infected Backyard Poultry Could Spread Bird Flu to People I have a backyard poultry flock. Should I be concerned about bird flu? What are symptoms to watch for? You should be vigilant about protecting your flock, and/or any domestic avian pets, from bird flu. Bird flu can affect wild or domesticated birds. Most poultry, including chickens, turkeys, guineafowl, and game birds like pheasants will die within days of exposure; wild and domestic ducksand some other species can be infected without ever appearing sick. Domestic poultry are exposed to bird flu through contact with infected birds, their droppings, or feathers. Pastures, yards, ponds, andequipment easily become contaminated with the virus. Humans can expose domestic birds to infection through use of contaminated equipment, clothing and footwear, and vehicle tires. Infected poultry, and possibly pet birds, may show one or more of the following signs: Sudden death with no prior signs Low energy or appetite Purple discoloration or swelling of various body parts Reduced egg production, or soft-shelled/misshapen eggs Nasal discharge, coughing, or sneezing Lack of coordination Diarrhea If you develop any of these signs or symptoms during the 10-days after your exposure to an infected or potentially infected animal, call the MA Dept. of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences, Division of Epidemiology and Immunization at (617) 983-6800. The on-call epidemiologist is available during normal business hours for emergencies and to answer questions regarding case investigation and implementation of control measures. If testing is recommended, isolate as much as possible until test results come back and/or you have recovered from your illness. Mass.gov Infographic: Protecting your Backyard Flock Information from the American Veterinary Medical Association: Avian Influenza in Pets and Backyard Flocks How do I report sick or dead poultry in my flock? Immediately call the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources, Animal Health Division at (617) 626-1795. You can also submit the following poultry disease reporting form online: Poultry Disease Reporting Form | Mass.gov. My pet found a dead bird and carried it in their mouth. Could they become infected with bird flu? Could they infect me or my family? Although bird flu viruses mainly infect and spread among wild migratory water birds and domestic poultry, some bird flu viruses can infect and spread to other animals as well. Bird flu viruses have in the past been known to sometimes infect mammals that eat (presumably infected) birds or poultry, including but not limited to wild animals, such as seals, bears, foxes, skunks; farmed mink; stray or domestic animals, such as cats and dogs; and zoo animals, such as tigers and leopards. If your domestic animals (e.g., cats or dogs) go outside and could potentially eat or be exposed to sick or dead birds infected with bird flu viruses, or an environment contaminated with bird flu virus, they could become infected with bird flu. While it’s unlikely that you would get sick with bird flu through direct contact with your infected pet, it is possible. For more information visit: Bird Flu in Pets and Other Animals | Avian Influenza (Flu) (cdc.gov) What should I do if I suspect I may have been exposed to bird flu? What are the signs and symptoms of bird flu in humans? People who have had direct contact with infected or potentially infected animals, including sick animals that might have eaten bird flu-infected birds, should monitor their health for fever and symptoms of infection. Signs and Symptoms may include: Fever (Temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater) or feeling feverish/chills* Cough Sore throat Difficulty breathing/Shortness of breath Conjunctivitis (eye tearing, redness, irritation, or discharge from eye) Headaches Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Diarrhea *Fever may not always be present. If you develop any of these signs or symptoms during the 10-days after your exposure to an infected or potentially infected animal, call the Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences Division of Epidemiology at (617) 983-6800. The on-call epidemiologist is available during normal business hours for emergencies and to answer questions regarding case investigation and implementation of control measures. Discuss your potential exposure and ask about testing. If testing is recommended, isolate as much as possible until test results come back and/or you have recovered from your illness.

Please click the following link to complete an online form and include a photo if possible: Report observations of dead wild birds | Mass.gov. PLEASE NOTE: An individual dead wild bird does not generally require testing or removal. However, removal/disposal of dead birds from the environment is a good practice to help reduce environmental contamination and potential exposure to other birds and mammals. No single entity is responsible for the removal/disposal of dead birds; it is dependent on the municipality and the landowner. For information about how to safely dispose of a dead bird or animal, please visit: Found a Dead Wild Bird? Here’s What To Do Next (usda.gov). Key Takeaways While bird flu does NOT pose an immediate health threat to people, it does spread easily among wild and domestic birds, including poultry. Overall, the risk to the public from bird flu outbreaks is low; however, bird flu viruses have been known to infect people sporadically following close, prolonged, unprotected contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces. No human bird flu infections have been reported from proper handling of poultry meat or from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products. Backyard poultry CAN become infected with bird flu through exposure to infected wild animals or surfaces contaminated by infected wild animals. If you suspect one of your birds has bird flu or has died from becoming infected with bird flu, immediately call the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources, Animal Health Division at (617) 626-1795. Keep your pets away from dead birds and animals to prevent exposure. Never handle a dead bird or animal with our taking appropriate precautions.

Eight states have a confirmed case of bird flu on dairy cattle herds. U.S. Department of Agriculture officials say wild migratory birds are the likely source of infection on the cattle.Lance Cheung / U.S. Department of AgricultureSo far, eight states across the country have reported cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or simply bird flu, in dairy cattle herds — including Idaho. There are no active cases in Oregon, but farmers and officials have started taking precautions.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorThe strain, novel avian influenza H5N, is the same flu strain that has affected millions of poultry birds across the U.S. since 2022, including nearly 800,000 commercial chickens in Oregon, and several backyard flocks, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.The virus was first detected in late March in two dairy herds in Texas and two in Kansas. Those infections mark the first time bird flu has been detected in dairy cattle, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.What’s the risk to dairy cows and humans?USDA officials say wild migratory birds are believed to be the original source of the virus, though officials say in some cases, the virus may have been transmitted between cows. An analysis of the virus in cattle suggests it has not mutated or become more transmissible to humans. Although it is possible, unless a person is in prolonged contact with a sick animal, it’s rare for a person to contract the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.While the virus is fatal for birds, cows tend to recover on their own, and milk supplies are still safe, said Jenifer Cruickshank, an Oregon State University dairy specialist and assistant professor.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a Sponsor“Influenza viruses, and most viruses honestly, are really easily killed by pasteurization,” Cruickshank said. “And the milk supply, there’s absolutely zero concern about the safety of the milk supply.”Milk from impacted animals is being diverted or destroyed so that it does not enter the food supply, according to the USDA.How is Oregon responding?As a precaution, the Oregon Department of Agriculture recently set some restrictions for cattle coming from states where the virus has been found in dairy herds. Dairy cattle will need an import permit issued by the state and a veterinary inspection before coming into the state. Cruickshank said, however, state-to-state movement of dairy cows to Oregon is uncommon. Other states with similar movement restrictions include California and Idaho.The state’s department of agriculture is suggesting farmers practice what it calls “good biosecurity,” like minimizing dairy livestock movements and isolating sick cows from the herd if they show symptoms like loss of appetite or a drop in milk production.Tami Kerr, the executive director of the Oregon Dairy Farmers Association — an industry trade group — said while the risk of infection in cows is still low, concerns about bird flu present a challenge to dairy producers.“I think it heightens awareness, and there’s already an awful lot of challenges being a dairy farmer. You don’t control the price of your milk and all the other expenses have risen substantially over the last five years,” Kerr said. “COVID had a very negative impact on our supply chain, and it really increased a lot of costs. There’s a lot of things that are out of control of our dairy farmers.”Cruickshank added that sick cows can be an economic hit for farmers, although what’s most uncertain for now are the long-term effects of the virus.“The long-term concern is the potential for mutation of the virus to either be more pathogenic, having more severe consequences or becoming more transmissible,” Cruickshank.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a Sponsor📨 Stay informed after Election DayLearn what the election results will mean for the Pacific Northwest.

Domestic birds host for bovine influenza A virus Epidemiologist says there is “still lots” to investigate about how virus jumped from from birds to dairy cattle By Stew Slater Reading Time: 4 minutes Published: April 18, 2024 Cow health, Dairy, Livestock, News (John Greig photo) Newsletter Sign Up - Get access to essential information on Canada’s cattle industry daily One email delivered 6 days a week for ranchers, feedlots, packers and livestock sales operators Your Email(Required) Your Postal Code(Required) Consent I consent to receiving emails from Glacier FarmMedia, its affiliates and divisions and third parties, containing agriculture news, updates and promotions.

Domestic birds that live in and around barns have been confirmed as the avian hosts of an outbreak on dairy farms in the United States of highly pathogenic avian influenza. ADVERTISEMENT Read Also Public trust in food system sees sharp decline The Canadian public has become more divided and skeptical of Canada’s food system over the last year, according to the Canadian Centre for Food Integrity’s latest Public Trust Research Report. An April 16 update from the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the avian host in this outbreak wasn’t migratory waterfowl, as has been common with confirmed North American outbreaks on domestic poultry farms, but rather pigeons, grackles and blackbirds. Why it matters: Biosecurity measures for dairy farms could change depending on the type of avian species that cause the infection. Investigations are ongoing about the exact vectors taken by the virus that led to deaths in several barn cats, a mild infection in one Texas dairy employee, and either positive or presumed positive HPAI tests on dairy cows in 16 herds from six states. This confirmation was no surprise to Dr. Jean-Pierre Vaillaincourt, an epidemiologist with University of Montreal’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. He says the influenza A virus doesn’t spread readily in feces so the chances are low that geese or ducks could infect dairy cows during a fly-over. It also doesn’t spread easily through nasal droplets so the likelihood is low that cows would spread the virus to other cows. However, Vaillaincourt said there is still lots to investigate and these methods of viral spread can’t be ruled out. The domestic avian hosts likely contaminated either feed or water with organic matter from an infected bird that has continual access to cattle housing and/or feeding areas. It was reported that USDA officials had “floated the possibility, without naming specific herds or locations, that all affected cows may trace back to a single farm.” ADVERTISEMENT Vaillaincourt believes this means positive tests in other states resulted from cattle imported onto those farms from Texas, a fact confirmed in some U.S. cases. He says it’s likely HPAI was circulating in dairy facilities in Texas and possibly nearby states for several weeks before someone decided to test for HPAI. “(The infection in cows) is noticeable, but it’s not really a classic case of anything … (and) they seem to recover after two weeks. They may have, in several states, had a problem for quite some time and they didn’t know.” In an open letter April 8, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners said HPAI in cattle should now be referred to as bovine influenza A virus (BIAV), to reflect that the disease is less lethal and presents with different symptoms in cattle than in poultry. The person with the illness was almost certainly infected through cow’s milk, most likely splashing into their eyes or being introduced into their eyes by contaminated hands. “Right now, the (U.S.-based) Centers for Disease Control in the U.S. is recommending people wear goggles” while dealing with infected cows, Vaillaincourt said. Feeding raw milk to either humans or calves is discouraged. Cows don’t typically get milk in their eyes or noses and won’t knowingly eat a dead bird. But they could consume organic matter from a bird if it’s in feed or a water source. “Water will be a big (subject of investigation),” he said. “In non-treated water, this virus could survive for weeks.” ADVERTISEMENT Glacier FarmMedia contacted a scientist from the National Microbiology Laboratory quoted in a U.S. National Public Radio story, but they referred questions to the organization’s media department, and Health Canada said all inquiries should be directed to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The CFIA sent this statement: “We are currently monitoring how this virus has been transmitted between different species and why it is affecting some mammals differently than others. The CFIA is working with the USDA, public health authorities, Canada’s veterinary community, industry and the provinces and territories to monitor the situation closely. “Producers are encouraged to follow good biosecurity measures such as those outlined in the National Biosecurity Standards. Producers are also requested to monitor livestock for clinical signs, including a sudden decrease in milk production or feed consumption, and to contact their veterinarian for any suspected cases.” Vaillaincourt said the highly pathogenic poultry disease appearing on a dairy farm and infecting one person, “doesn’t fit anywhere within what the government has in place to manage infectious diseases.” Another topic of behind-closed-doors discussion, Vaillancourt said, is the lack of precedent for what to do if a mild infection, albeit one with significant possible wider-scale repercussions, turns up in cows in Canada. A major dairy show is scheduled soon in Quebec and numerous bovine guests are expected to cross the border from the U.S., so “we don’t have a process right now that would require those cattle be tested for avian influenza.” Without a process in place, should all U.S. visitors be turned back? Alternatively, if a testing process is put in place, what should happen if there’s a positive test for this mild and so-far short-lived infection? Do we quarantine cows? ADVERTISEMENT “CFIA is not going to go and investigate these things. They don’t have the manpower. They already don’t have all the resources they need to cover poultry,” said Vaillancourt. As a result, the agency said that if symptoms appear on dairy farms, farmers should contact a veterinarian to have samples tested. If positive for BIAV, it must be reported to the CFIA. The CFIA and Health Canada are watching for signs that the strain is zoonotic. “If we had dead cows in the U.S., this would be a very different story,” said Vaillancourt. That would lead agencies on both sides of the border to implement biosecurity measures aimed at preserving the health of the dairy herd. Officials in both countries remain on guard. “It is one more species that can be infected, and the more the virus can cycle within different species, the more it has a chance to mutate.” About the author Stew Slater Contributor Stew Slater operates a small dairy farm on 150 acres near St. Marys, Ont., and has been writing about rural and agricultural issues since 1999.

Why dairy and not beef? Several factors favour bovine influenza A detection on dairy versus beef farms By Stew Slater Reading Time: 2 minutes Published: April 18, 2024 Cow health, Dairy, Livestock So far, the virus has not been lethal to cattle and causes very different symptoms than it does in poultry.

Recent detection in the United States of a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in dairy cattle is the first instance of this strain in bovines. ADVERTISEMENT Read Also Jeffrey-Way Hard Rock Twigs wins Royal Supreme Champion Jeffrey-Way Hard Rock Twigs won her second of North America’s major dairy show championships when she took the Royal Agricultural… The World Organization for Animal Health said the detections “have raised concerns since such infections of cattle could indicate an increased risk of H5N1 viruses becoming better adapted to mammals, and potentially spilling over to humans and other livestock.” So far, the virus has not been lethal to cattle and causes very different symptoms than it does in poultry. For that reason, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners wrote in an open letter April 8 that the virus in cattle should be referred to as bovine influenza A virus, or BIAV. A global outbreak of this strain in poultry began in 2022 and has spread most effectively through migratory birds. It was believed beef cattle would be at greater risk of exposure to infected migratory birds than dairy cattle because they’re more often housed outdoors. University of Montreal faculty member Dr. Jean-Pierre Vaillaincourt said there are several reasons why dairy farms are more likely bovine hosts. It’s possible all recent U.S. cases originated from one or a few herds in Texas, where outdoor housing is common. So dairy cattle contact with migratory birds, as was hinted by the state’s governor when positive tests were announced in late March, is more likely in that region. Subsequent investigation revealed the dead birds found on the Texas farms weren’t migratory but rather “peridomestic” species — pigeons, blackbirds and grackles. These are commonly found inside or on the immediate exterior of dairy facilities, not just in Texas but across the continent. This strain doesn’t spread effectively through nasal droplets. Cow-to-cow transmission may have occurred in the U.S. outbreak but if so, it most likely happened through contaminated milking equipment. ADVERTISEMENT On beef farms, such cow-to-cow transmission is unlikely. So far, recorded symptoms among bovines have been minor. Typically, symptoms are more systematically monitored on dairy farms compared to beef farms so a cow with a mild illness is more likely to be noticed on a dairy farm. It’s possible that this strain of influenza has already infected cattle in Canada that are housed outdoors, Vaillaincourt conceded, but no one either noticed or felt it necessary to have any mildly affected cow tested. It’s also possible, however, that “there is a difference between a beef cow and a dairy cow” and that a typical dairy cow may be more susceptible to BIAV. They have different stressors, the University of Montreal professor noted, due to genetics and management regimes.

PDF FILE Vietnam has recently made headlines by reporting its first human infection with a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A (H9N2) virus. This development has raised concerns among health authorities and the public, given the history of avian influenza outbreaks globally. Understanding the H9N2 virus The H9N2 virus is a subtype of avian influenza that primarily affects birds. Unlike the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) virus, which has caused significant outbreaks in poultry and cattle worldwide, the H9N2 virus is considered less severe. However, any human infection with avian influenza warrants close monitoring and investigation. How does human infection occur? Wild water birds serve as natural hosts for avian influenza viruses. These infected birds shed the virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces. While rare, human infections can occur when the virus enters a person’s eyes, nose, mouth, or is inhaled. People with direct or close unprotected exposure to sick or dead birds are at risk, especially in areas where avian influenza is endemic among wild birds. The vietnamese case The first human infection with the A (H9N2) virus in Vietnam occurred in an adult with underlying medical conditions. The patient was hospitalized on March 16, 2024, and remains under close monitoring and treatment. Fortunately, there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission at this time.Continue after advertising. Global context Vietnam is not alone in facing sporadic human infections with avian influenza viruses. Since 1998, more than 100 cases have been reported in China, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Oman, Pakistan, and Senegal. Although some deaths have been documented, most infections with H9N2 avian influenza result in mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. H9N2 in birds In Vietnam, A (H9N2) viruses are the most commonly identified avian influenza viruses. They represent over 50% of all subtyped detections from live bird markets in the country. These viruses circulate in bird populations across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. While they cause few signs of disease in infected wild birds, poultry workers in Vietnam have previously shown antibodies to H9 viruses. Surveillance and coordination The Hospital for Tropical Diseases, supported by the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), sequenced a portion of the genome from the Vietnamese patient. The results were consistent with earlier influenza A (H9) viruses. The Pasteur Institute Ho Chi Minh (PI-HCM) also confirmed the presence of influenza A (H9) viruses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) closely monitors the H9N2 situation and collaborates with domestic and international partners. While there is no immediate threat to the U.S. public, vigilance remains crucial. In conclusion, Vietnam’s first human case of avian influenza H9N2 serves as a reminder of the ongoing risks posed by these viruses. Public health efforts must continue to track and respond to emerging infectious diseases, even when the impact on humans appears limited.

Vietnam has registered the country’s first human infection with a common flu virus of avian origin. Latest official update on the HPAI situation in Taiwan’s domestic poultry covers 22 outbreaks directly impacting more than 317,000 birds.Starting between January 18 and March 18, these outbreaks linked to the H5N1 HPAI virus serotype were reported earlier this month to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).Each affected flock comprised between around 200 and 33,800 poultry — mainly native chickens, but also meat chickens, laying hens, and breeding geese. While the majority involved farms, two outbreaks were detected at slaughterhouses, and one at an unidentified location. Premises were located in seven counties/cities. Based on WOAH data, 32 HPAI outbreaks linked to this virus variant have been confirmed in Taiwan since November of last year. These have involved around 408,500 poultry. More recently, Taiwan News has reported two further outbreaks. These involved two flocks of laying hens — comprising around 36,800 birds in Chiayi county, and 20,000 in Changhua.In late February, one more wild bird tested positive for the H5N1 HPAI virus in Taiwan, according to a separate report to WOAH. India confirms HPAI in 2 statesAt the end of February, presence of HPAI of the same virus serotype was detected at a regional poultry hatchery in Nagpur — one of the largest cities in the western state of Maharashtra. According to the official report received last week by WOAH, 2,650 of the around 11,400 poultry at the premises died, and the rest have been culled. Authorities have also officially confirmed to the agency details of two earlier outbreaks in poultry in Andhra Pradesh. Cases in this state in southern India were reported previously by local media. In the first week of February, the H5N1 virus variant was detected at two locations in the district of Nellore. Affected were first a farm with around 10,000 birds, and then a backyard flock at a distance of more than 20km.In neither Andhra Pradesh nor Maharashtra has the source of infection been identified. Philippines confirms first HPAI in Eastern Visayas regionLast month, local media reported the first ever outbreak of HPAI linked to the H5N1 virus serotype in the Eastern Visayas island region of the Philippines.According to the official notification sent recently to WOAH, affected was a farm with around 60,500 poultry in province of Leyte. Almost 4,500 of the birds died, and the rest were culled to prevent further spread of infection. Source of infection is through to be wild birds or fomites, and the farm is surrounded by rice paddies that attract wildlife. Meanwhile, three more outbreaks linked to the same virus variant in the Luzon area have also been registered with WOAH by the Philippines’ authorities.These started between February 20 and March 10 and involved flocks described as “backyards.” The two earlier outbreaks were in the province of Pampanga, and the most recent was located in Kalinga. This HPAI outbreak series began in January of 2022, and now comprises 259 outbreaks involving almost 2.1 million poultry.To WOAH the authorities in the Philippines have recently declared a separate H5N1 HPAI outbreak series “resolved.” This covered broadly the island of Mindanao, and cases detected between February of 2022 and January of 2023. Directly impacted over this period were around 102,400 poultry at 27 locations.Latest update on the disease situation in the country from the Bureau of Animal Industry puts the number of ongoing outbreaks at four (as of April 12).In the Central Luzon region, outbreaks have occurred at one farm with quails in the province of Pampanga, as well as two premises in Nueva Ecija — one with quails and one with game birds. The outbreak in Leyte, Eastern Visayas involved broiler breeders.Earlier this month, Philippine Star reported that authorities had seized quantities of unauthorized avian influenza vaccine. This was found — in plastic cups containing dry ice — in hand luggage of incoming passengers from Vietnam and other Asian countries. HPAI developments in poultry elsewhere in AsiaThis week, the HPAI situation in South Korea has been declared “resolved” to WOAH. The declarations cover cases involving both poultry and wild birds, and the H5N1 and H5N6 virus serotypes. Since December of last year, six outbreaks involving the H5N1 variant were confirmed in domestic poultry, and birds tested positive for the H5N6 virus at 26 farms. Meanwhile, WOAH has been notified that movement restrictions linked to the most recent HPAI outbreak in Japan have been lifted. This means there are no ongoing outbreaks in the country. Two further human infections in AsiaOver recent weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded two further infections with avian influenza A virus in people in the Western Pacific region.In China, a 51-year-old poultry farmer in Yunnan province has a confirmed infection with avian influenza A(H10N3) virus, according to WHO. His symptoms began at the end of February, and he was admitted to hospital in early March.Furthermore, Vietnam recorded its first ever human infection with a low-pathogenic avian influenza A(H9N2) virus last week. The patient was a 37-year-old man, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Source of the man’s infection is uncertain. Although he lived near a poultry market, no sick or dead birds have been reported there. The patient has underlying health conditions, and was admitted to hospital. This virus variant is known to circulate in poultry in many regions, and is the type most often identified in Vietnam.At the end of March, the death was confirmed to WHO of a previously reported case involving the H5N1 virus variant in Vietnam. The 21-year-old man had no known contact with infected poultry, but had been involved in trapping wild birds prior to the onset of his symptoms.

It sporadically hits various locations like a bolt of lightning. The situation is no different in April of 2024 with Alappuzha grappling with the disease. When bird flu is mentioned, it is often dismissed as inconsequential, with the belief that abstaining from chicken, duck meat, and eggs for a few days is sufficient to ride it out, given that only birds contract the disease. While this premise holds, recent research suggests that humans are on the brink of encountering deadly strains of bird flu (H5N1–H5N1). 'Treat with utmost seriousness' Following the discovery in the US that bird flu is not only spreading among chickens and ducks but also transferring from birds to humans, the global health sector is grappling with this new challenge. Experts warn that if the virus infects humans, it could be 100 times more dangerous than COVID-19. The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has already cautioned doctors to treat cases occurring in individuals closely associated with birds and livestock with utmost seriousness, aiming to minimize further spread.

Photo: IANS Constant mutation In Kerala, thousands of chickens and ducks have been culled in past years due to bird flu outbreaks in districts such as Alappuzha, Kottayam, and Kozhikode. But many farmers have yet to receive compensation for their losses, impacting other sectors as well. Amidst these ongoing crises, health experts are highlighting another pressing issue: the constant mutation of the H5N1 virus, increasing the likelihood of aggressive human infections. Individuals with influenza, pneumonia, or respiratory illnesses may be suspected of having bird flu if they have had direct or indirect contact with sick birds. Confirmation of bird flu can be obtained through laboratory tests. Health After COVID, WHO defines disease spread through air Travel Thrissur Pooram: Food, medical care, ayurvedic drinking water, ambulance services in place How disease spreads Bird flu viruses are relatively less contagious. However, under certain circumstances, viruses typically confined to birds can infect humans. The disease spreads through the excreta and bodily fluids of birds and is not airborne. If the virus transfers from birds to humans, viral pneumonia is likely to occur in 60% of cases. These viruses become pathogenic through specific genetic changes. Moreover, the virus can combine with human influenza viruses, creating new genomes that are highly pathogenic. Individuals working in bird breeding and poultry farms are particularly vulnerable to the disease. Research indicates that bird flu viruses can affect all parts of the human body. In many countries, half of the number of infected people succumbed to the virus. The deadly H5N1 viruses are lethal to humans. Despite available drugs, viral pneumonia remains a severe condition with a mortality rate of around 70%. Infected patients require treatment in isolation wards of hospitals. Although a protective vaccine has been developed, its use in India is pending. Notably, the vaccine effective against common influenza (H1N1) does not offer protection against bird flu. First in China; now in Kerala too Bird flu initially spread to humans in Hong Kong, China, resulting in numerous deaths during that period. Subsequently, it spread to Asian countries, then to Europe and Africa. Although bird flu has not yet extensively affected humans in India, health researchers have consistently cautioned against dismissing the possibility of human transmission in the country. This concern has now materialized in the US. The gravest aspect is the potential for bird flu to spread from humans to other humans if it first spreads from birds to humans. The World Health Organization advocates for the scientific culling of birds within a one-kilometre radius of the reported disease outbreak as an effective control measure. On November 24, 2014, residents of Kerala were alarmed by the first H5N1 infection report. Bird flu was initially confirmed in the districts of Kottayam and Alappuzha in Kerala. Emergency measures were promptly initiated to prevent human transmission. The H5N1 influenza virus causes bird flu. In 2014, the bird flu threat primarily affected ducks in Kuttanad, Kerala. The Animal Husbandry Department conducted mass culling, eliminating thousands of ducks during that period. Thoughtful preventive measures and an awareness campaign successfully confined avian flu to the duck population of Kuttanad. As fears escalate, many individuals remove chicken and duck from their menus. Photo: Chef Arun Vijayan Is chicken also a villain? When reports of bird flu surface, chickens often become the primary suspect. As fears escalate, many individuals remove chicken and duck from their menus. However, experts offer guidance on consuming chicken and duck safely. These poultry products can still be enjoyed without fear of contracting the disease. It is simply a matter of taking necessary precautions. Avian flu symptoms in birds Birds affected by bird flu exhibit various symptoms, including lethargy, sluggishness in movement, reluctance to eat, extreme fatigue, bluish beak and plumage, nosebleeds, diarrhoea, and respiratory distress. Additionally, the thickness of eggshells decreases and there is a significant reduction in the number of eggs laid. Ultimately, this can culminate in severe pneumonia. Without proper treatment, affected birds are prone to mass mortality. Symptoms in humans The typical symptoms of bird flu in humans encompass a range of common ailments, such as cold, headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, body aches, cough, unusual fatigue, and severe sore throat. Diagnosis of infected patients typically involves testing secretions obtained from the throat and nose. The definitive laboratory test is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Alternatively, diagnosis can be established by assessing the levels of H5N1 antibody in the patient's blood serum. Bird flu a century ago Avian flu, an infectious disease caused by a virus in birds, spreads from wild birds to domestic fowl. Italian scientist Eduardo Peroncito was the first to identify a virus as the cause of bird flu in 1878. In 1955, it was confirmed that this virus belongs to the type A influenza group. This disease can emerge globally irrespective of the season. Symptoms typically manifest in birds three to five days after exposure to the virus. This airborne disease can also be transmitted to humans through sewage, food, and clothing. However, in 1997, it was discovered to pose a significant threat to human life. Six fatalities occurred due to bird flu in Hong Kong at that time. Although highly contagious in birds, the virus does not spread as rapidly in humans. Nonetheless, there is a risk of the virus entering humans and causing common cold or potentially fatal diseases. Bird flu was first confirmed in India on February 18, 2006, in a chicken farm in Navapur, Maharashtra. Subsequently, it was detected in States including Manipur, Bengal, Assam, Tripura, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Sikkim, and Meghalaya. The first instance of bird flu in South India occurred in October 2012 at a turkey farm belonging to the Central Poultry Development Organization in Bengaluru. Avian flu, an infectious disease caused by a virus in birds, spreads from wild birds to domestic fowl. Photo: Shutterstock/Festa Crows and cats are carriers The disease stems from the type A influenza virus, primarily affecting chickens and turkeys. This virus belongs to the Orthomyxo family and is highly prone to mutation. The virus, which is highly susceptible to mutation, has three variants of influenza type A, type B and type C. All three variants are capable of infecting humans. Type A influenza predominantly affects birds and animals. The H5N1 subtype viruses identified in Kerala can afflict various avian species, including ducks, flamingos, quails, guinea fowl, wild birds, crows, cats, dogs, and even tigers. However, pet birds like pigeons and parrots are less susceptible to H5N1 virus infection. Tags: Health Bird Flu The comments posted here/below/in the given space are not on behalf of Onmanorama.

(Instagram: jajassa)"He also said that in any case I wouldn't be able to catch the birds," he said."But I knew that thousands upon thousands of mutton birds, or shearwaters, nested on the coral cays of the reef in burrows in the sand, and that all you had to do to catch these wild, free-flying sea birds was to bend over and pick them up."A lifelong obsessionAfter Professor Webster found birds on Tryon which had been infected with influenza, Professor Laver mixed parts of the human virus with a part of the bird samples to look at how the flu could be prevented.Black noddy terns were tested by Dr Laver's team. (ABC Capricornia: Erin Semmler)Senior librarian at the Queensland State Library, Christina Ealing-Godbold, studied their work and said the virologist tested hundreds of birds as part of this study, which proved the virus could be inhibited."This was a huge breakthrough because they didn't understand what was causing these pandemics," Ms Ealing-Gobold said."It was his lifetime obsession to try and solve the irregular pandemic upheavals that have dominated medical science for so many years."Professor Laver even sent samples from a black noddy bird to a Russian space station to grow under microgravity conditions. The endeavour was later abandoned as the crystals were found to grow almost as well on land.Californian pharmaceutical company Gilead Science used Professor Laver's research to develop the anti-viral drug Tamiflu, which is still available today.ABC Capricornia — local news in your inboxGet our local newsletter, delivered free each FridayYour information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Sun 14 Apr 2024 at 1:24amSunday 14 Apr 2024 at 1:24amSun 14 Apr 2024 at 1:24amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

This scientific opinion, authored by experts in the field, focuses on surveillance and mitigation measures to combat this disease in poultry populations.The article discusses poultry vaccination against HPAI and emphasizes surveillance and mitigation measures. Overall, it provides insights into the complexities of implementing vaccination programs and surveillance measures to combat HPAI in poultry, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches and continuous monitoring to prevent and control disease outbreaks.The main conclusions drawn from the article on the vaccination of poultry against HPAI include:1. Selecting appropriate diagnostic methods tailored to the type of vaccine used is crucial for effective surveillance of AI virus circulation in vaccinated flocks.2. Molecular methods with high sensitivity are recommended for surveillance when viral levels expected to be detected are low due to vaccination.3. Serological methods may increase confidence in virological surveillance results, but their utility can be compromised with non-DIVA compatible vaccines.4. Surveillance strategies should include virological testing of dead birds, live bird testing in vaccinated establishments, and passive surveillance in both vaccinated and unvaccinated flocks.5. Repeated sampling over time, testing of birds found dead within 48 hours, and monitoring of clinical signs are essential for maximizing surveillance effectiveness.6. Risk mitigation measures, such as movement restrictions and laboratory examinations before poultry movement, are important for preventing disease spread.These conclusions highlight the importance of tailored surveillance strategies, diagnostic methods, and risk mitigation measures in effectively monitoring and controlling the spread of avian influenza in poultry populations following vaccination.

Bird flu outbreak in Kerala's Alappuzha has left health authorities in the district worried. According to a PTI report, the disease was confirmed in ducks reared in an area of ward 1 of Edathva Grama Panchayat and another area in ward 3 of Cheruthana Grama Panchayat, as per officials after their sample tested positive for avian influenza (H5N1). (Also read: Bird flu reported in Kerala's Alapuzzha. How to stay safe?) Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is a viral infection that primarily affects birds. However, in some cases, it can spread to humans, causing illness ranging from mild to severe. (PTI) Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, has been a cause of worry globally due to its potential to infect humans. In the light of recent spread of infection among ducks in Kerala, it is important to know about the symptoms, and prevention of the disease. It also raises concern about the possible spread of the avian influenza virus in humans. Here's what the experts have to say. Symptoms of bird flu in humans"Symptoms of bird flu in humans can vary but often include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia/ARDS and respiratory failure," says Dr. Ankur Gupta, Consultant - Internal Medicine, Fortis Escorts, Okhla Road, New Delhi. "Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is a viral infection that primarily affects birds. However, in some cases, it can spread to humans, causing illness ranging from mild to severe. The symptoms of bird flu in humans are similar to those of regular influenza and may include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue, and respiratory difficulties. In severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia and even death," says Dr Rahul Agarwal Consultant Internal Medicine CARE Hospitals Hitech City Hyderabad. The recent outbreak of bird flu in Alappuzha, Kerala, demands urgent attention for public health. The Avian Influenza virus, primarily affecting birds, poses a significant risk to human health as it can spread to humans, leading to severe respiratory illness and potentially fatal outcomes. "In response to this outbreak, the Animal Husbandry Department in Kerala has initiated several crucial measures aimed at controlling the spread of the virus, including upgrading laboratory networks, establishing diagnostic facilities, and introducing lateral flow kits for rapid field-level disease diagnosis," says Dr Puneet Gupta, Head - Department of Pulmonology, Interventional Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine, Yatharth Super Specialty Hospital, Noida Extension. How does it spread in humans?"Humans can catch bird flu through close contact with infected birds, including touching them, their droppings, or bedding, or killing or preparing them for cooking. The most likely way for a human to catch bird flu is through exposure to birds, bird faeces, or feathers. Water birds such as wild ducks are believed to be the carriers of all avian influenza type A viruses. If someone has been in close contact with infected birds and exhibits these symptoms, it's crucial to seek medical attention promptly," says Dr Gupta. "Avian influenza can be transmitted to humans through close contact with infected birds or their excretions, as well as through person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets. Therefore, it is imperative that we emphasize preventive measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. This includes practicing good hygiene, avoiding direct contact with infected birds or their droppings, and wearing masks in areas where the virus is prevalent," says Dr Puneet. Does the disease spread from birds to humans?"The spread of bird flu from birds to humans is rare. Globally, from January 1, 2003, to February 26, 2024, 887 cases of human infection with bird flu were reported from 23 countries. Of these 887 cases, 462 were fatal (CFR of 52%), as per the World Health Organisation), and sustained human-to-human transmission is even rarer (no report till date in India). However, the potential for the virus to mutate and become more transmissible among humans is a concern for public health authorities. Monitoring and containment efforts are crucial to prevent outbreaks and minimize the risk of a pandemic," says Dr Gupta. Treatment of bird flu"Treatment for bird flu usually involves antiviral medications, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), which can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. However, the effectiveness of these medications may vary depending on the strain of the virus and the individual's overall health," says Dr Rahul Agarwal Consultant Internal Medicine CARE Hospitals Hitech City Hyderabad. "In addition to antiviral medications, supportive care is often necessary, especially for individuals experiencing severe symptoms. This may include rest, hydration, and, in some cases, hospitalization for close monitoring and treatment," adds Dr Agarwal. Prevention tips"Prevention is key to reducing the risk of bird flu. Avoiding contact with sick birds, practicing good hygiene such as washing hands frequently, and properly cooking poultry products are essential measures. Additionally, wearing protective gear when handling sick birds or cleaning contaminated areas can further reduce the risk of transmission," says Dr Gupta of Fortis Hospital. "As with any infectious disease outbreak, it's essential to follow public health guidelines and recommendations. This may include practicing good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing, avoiding contact with sick birds or poultry, and taking precautions when handling raw poultry products," says Dr Agarwal. "While bird flu outbreaks can be concerning, the risk of human-to-human transmission is generally low. However, health authorities closely monitor these outbreaks to prevent the spread of the virus and protect public health. Staying informed and following the guidance of health officials can help mitigate the risks associated with bird flu," adds Dr Agarwal. Is it concerning?The confirmation of the H5N1 avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu in Alappuzha district is a concerning development. Bird flu is a highly contagious viral infection that primarily affects birds, caused by influenza viruses that normally circulate among wild aquatic birds. "The H5N1 strain is particularly concerning as it has a high pathogenicity and it can cause severe illness and high mortality rates in infected bird populations. Prompt action including strict biosecurity measures, and vigilant surveillance, is crucial to mitigate the economic and environmental impact of such outbreaks on poultry farming and the potential risk to public health," says Dr Suranjit Chatterjee Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital. "It is important to note that while human cases of H5N1 are rare, the virus can potentially cross the species barrier and infect humans through close contact with infected birds or contaminated environments. Therefore, it is important for poultry workers, farmers, and individuals in affected areas to exercise caution and practice good hygiene," adds Dr Chatterjee. "While the presence of bird flu in Kerala is concerning, it's essential to avoid panic and instead focus on taking proactive measures to prevent transmission. Overall, while vigilance is warranted, there's no need for undue alarm. By staying informed, following preventive measures, and seeking medical attention if experiencing symptoms, individuals can help reduce the risk of bird flu transmission and protect public health," concludes Dr Gupta.

They are incredible at mutating to find new hosts in animal and human bodies. They can adapt to unlock, enter and infect a cell, and can change over and over again. The bird flu that is sweeping the world has now infected hundreds of species of animals. Scientists say we are living through a panzootic - that's an animal pandemic. What is bird flu? Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is a highly contagious virus that affects bird species and can spread to other species, including humans. Just like human influenza, there are many types of bird flu and they can all have different effects on wild birds, poultry and other animals. Avian influenza viruses can be classed as high or low pathogenicity, a reference to their potential to kill chickens, not how infectious they are.

Photo: AFP/ Zhang Xiaoyu What is high pathogenicity avian influenza H5N1? This is the type of bird flu that has caused so many problems around the world in recent years. It's not new: highly pathogenic bird flu H5N1 was discovered more than 20 years ago and there have been outbreaks in different parts of the world. However the global spread has deepened since 2020, and the virus is now in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, North America and South America. It has even been found in Antarctica. Millions of poultry have died worldwide; in 2022 more than 131 million domestic poultry with H5N1 died or were culled across 67 countries on five continents. Wild bird communities have also been devastated, with an unprecedented number of deaths among some species, including endangered species. H5N1 has also spread to other wild animals - everything from foxes to seals, porpoises, bottlenose dolphins and grizzly bears have been affected - and farmed animals such as minks and dairy cows. How has bird flu spread to cows? In March, scientists discovered that a dairy herd in Texas had been infected with H5N1 after its milk production had dropped. A dead farm cat and an unusually high number of dead pigeons were clues that suggested the cows had bird flu - domestic cats in the United States were known to have contracted H5N1. Within a week, three other dairy herds in separate states were also diagnosed with avian influenza. Wild birds are thought to be the primary source of the outbreak, but US scientists are investigating if cow-to-cow transmission is already occurring. Four dairy herds in the US are reported to have cattle infected with H5N1. (File photo) Photo: RNZ / Sally Round Can humans get bird flu? One dairy worker in the United States has tested positive; they had conjunctivitis-like symptoms and were treated with anti-viral medication. Symptoms can range from mild (conjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms) to severe or critical disease leading to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, sepsis and death. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) asked state health officials to prepare for further human cases while saying the risk to the public remains low. Since H5N1 was discovered in the late 1990s, there have been about 900 confirmed human cases across 23 countries, mostly among livestock workers. More than half of people who contract H5N1 die with the disease. H5N1 virus particles (gold in colour) as seen through an electron microscope.

Despite this, health authorities worldwide are not taking bird flu lightly. Zoonotic diseases - those that can jump from animals to humans - are increasing around the world and scientists are alert to potential pandemic-causing viruses. Evidence suggests Covid-19 was introduced to humans through animals, though it has not been confirmed. Bird flu infections in people are rare but possible. Photo: CDC Are there any vaccines for bird flu? There are avian influenza vaccines for poultry but they are not used in every country, largely because they are considered ineffective. No vaccines have been developed to immunise other livestock, such as cows, against bird flu. And while humans don't yet have a bird flu vaccine, the research community's rapid Covid vaccine development has shown how quickly they can be produced. It has led to the global partnership CEPI (formerly the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) setting a 100-day target to produce a safe, effective vaccine for the next global disease outbreak.

For now, Australia remains one of the last places on Earth where this type of bird flu has not been found, the ABC said. This is thanks mainly to its isolated geographic location, which is outside many bird migration routes. But it's inevitable that H5N1 will reach Australia, scientists say. Spring is the highest risk time, when migratory birds are returning from their summer in the Northern Hemisphere. An Australian government assessment says there is an increasing risk of a bird flu outbreak, and the country's chief vet, Beth Cookson, says authorities are closely watching global developments. A review of the global H5N1 control and prevention strategy from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Organisation for Animal Health is expected in May. Australia is not immune to zoonotic disease outbreaks; a domestic bird flu detection in Victoria in 2020 resulted in almost 500,000 birds being destroyed and international trade of poultry halted. - This story was first published by ABC.

Male' | 18 Apr 2024 | Thu 07:30 Indhira Gandhi Memorial Hospital (IGMH) Sun Online Cases of influenza 125 cases of influenza detected so far this year Those with symptoms have been urged to follow precautions Common cold cases have been increasing 850 samples have been tested so far Zunana Zalif 9,765 A total of 125 cases of influenza have been confirmed across the Maldives so far this year. This was revealed by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on Wednesday. HPA revealed that the number of people reported to have exhibited symptoms of the virus in March was considerably low in comparison to the figure reported in February this year. The public health authority revealed that out of the 850 samples tested for the virus so far this year, 125 had returned positive. Further, HPA highlighted that the number of common cold cases had surged in March, in comparison to February. A total of 29,184 cases of common cold were reported to authorities in February this year, whereas the number increased to 33,637 during March. HPA has appealed on the public to vaccinate against influenza. HPA has also advised the public to take vaccination and precautionary treatment for influenza in the coming days. Some of the precautionary measures that have been urged include regular hand washing, taking more fluids if one catches the cold, only using paracetamol if one has a high temperature, covering one’s nose and mouth when coughing to make sure that others don’t get infected, wearing long-sleeve shirts and long pants and using mosquito repellent lotions or sprays to prevent dengue fever. While influenza and its complications can be deadly, individuals who are 65 and older, individuals with certain chronic medical conditions like diabetes, asthma or heart diseases, pregnant women, children below five and those who have recently undergone a transplant are more prone to getting complications. HPA has stressed on the importance of adhering to precautionary measures, to prevent the spread of viral flu and common cold cases.
