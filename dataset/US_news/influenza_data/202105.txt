In this study, we used messenger RNA (mRNA)-encoded Cas13a for mitigating influenza virus A and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in mice and hamsters, respectively. We designed CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) specific for PB1 and highly conserved regions of PB2 of influenza virus, and against the replicase and nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2, and selected the crRNAs that reduced viral RNA levels most efficiently in cell culture. We delivered polymer-formulated Cas13a mRNA and the validated guides to the respiratory tract using a nebulizer. In mice, Cas13a degraded influenza RNA in lung tissue efficiently when delivered after infection, whereas in hamsters, Cas13a delivery reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication and reduced symptoms. Our findings suggest that Cas13a-mediated targeting of pathogenic viruses can mitigate respiratory infections.

It is estimated that viral infections contribute to approximately 6.6% of global mortality3. This is especially concerning, given that there are approximately 90 drugs (from 1963 to 2016) to treat only nine viral species4. In addition, there are approved vaccines for only 15 viral species. Reassortment and antigenic shift and drift for influenza, as well as antibody-dependent enhancement for SARS and possibly SARS-CoV-2, pose challenges to vaccine development5,6. These factors likely contribute to epidemics and pandemics. Human health is thus under constant threat due to emerging and reemerging viral infections7. Outbreaks of Zika8, Ebola9, the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic10 and the potential for future influenza pandemics11 warrant the development of new classes of antiviral drugs4. Current drug development is focused on small molecules and neutralizing antibodies, which require high doses or frequent re-dosing to obtain functional outcomes12,13. Thus, it is crucial to address the need for antivirals that are broad spectrum, flexible and effective across multiple viral species or strains.The discovery of an RNA-targeting, class II, type VI CRISPR–Cas system in bacteria has engendered tremendous interest for potential applications. The Cas13a–crRNA complex activates when the target RNA (trans-activating RNA (trRNA)) complements with crRNA, and the Cas protein initiates RNA cleavage14,15, due to the higher eukaryote and prokaryote nucleotide-binding domain16. This property has been used to detect specific transcripts in mixtures of nucleic acids15. The specific RNase activity of Cas13a and Cas13d17 was also used to knock down endogenous genes, and, more recently, two groups have demonstrated the ability of Cas13b or Cas13d to degrade influenza RNA18,19. In both cases, transient transfection with plasmids or stable cell lines expressing Cas13 were used prophylactically against influenza RNA. In each case, Cas13 was expressed at least 24 h before infection, clearly demonstrating proof of principle.In this study, we examined crucial steps toward using this approach as a treatment for respiratory viral infections. Given the advantages of transient expression for treating infections, we developed synthetic mRNA to express LbuCas13a both with and without a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, as influenza RNA can be localized to both compartments at different times after infection, and both constructs were tested for function within in-tube assays. Why synthetic mRNA? Synthetic mRNA expression is transient and has very little chance of integrating, and innate immune responses can be mitigated through sequence design, modified nucleotides and purification20,21,22. In addition, given that Cas13a is a bacterial protein, it is possible that there might be immune responses to the protein itself, and this is more likely if it is expressed for long periods of time. Transient expression with minimal innate responses gives the highest probability of repeat dosing in vivo. Thus, this approach might be crucial for repeat dosing of Cas13a in infected individuals without immune clearance of treated cells due to Cas13a-mediated immune responses.The mRNA-based approach was initially benchmarked by examining knockdown of endogenous genes, using previously published target regions10. In examining these genes, and expanding the number of controls used, it was found that not all knockdown of RNA was mediated by Cas13a. Many controls were needed to ensure that the knockdown was Cas13a mediated and that enzymatic action was occurring. Once it was determined which controls were important, guides against PB1 were screened via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), given after infection, simulating a treatment strategy. Why polymerase genes? They are highly conserved, and, without polymerase protein, neither viral mRNA nor replication can occur10,23,24. A potent guide against PB1 mRNA was found using this approach, but guides with broader sequence homology across flu strains were sought. By first examining homology among 108 vaccine strains, a stretch of nucleotides in PB2 was found to overlap most H1N1 strains, including the H1N1 pandemic strain from 2009 and H3N2 strains used in previous vaccines. Vaccine strains are a benchmark for circulating strain variation over time and, thus, are good candidates. At least two potent guides against this sequence were found. Subsequent tests after infection included combining guides and time-course studies yielding potent knockdown of influenza RNA. We then asked whether this same approach could be used against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the current pandemic. We delivered the mRNA both before and after infection, with cytopathic effect (CPE) and RNA copy number used as the metrics for success, demonstrating clear mitigation of SARS-CoV-2.Finally, we demonstrated that this approach has translational potential by delivering Cas13 mRNA and guides formulated with a PBAE-based polymer25 via nebulizer post-influenza infection, simulating treatment. At day 3 after infection, degradation of influenza RNA in the lung was evaluated, demonstrating robust knockdown. In addition, using the Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection26,27,28, Cas13 mRNA and guides were delivered using the same formulations as mentioned above, 20 h before infection, demonstrating significant differences in body weight over a 6-d period. Infections were performed within the same 24-h time frame as delivery due to the rapid progression of the virus in this species29, as in recent studies using antibodies and small molecules30,31,32. Given that the peak of expression is approximately 24 h after transfection, this is a fair test of Cas13-mediated mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Overall, we have demonstrated the necessity of controls for designing crRNAs, the possibility of pan-influenza targeting of viral strains and the ability to target relevant and emergent respiratory pathogens, both in vitro and in vivo.ResultsmRNA expressed Cas13a cleaves RNA in the presence of both crRNA and trRNAUsing rabbit reticulocyte lysates, LbuCas13a and LbuCas13a-NLS (a variant with an NLS sequence) mRNAs were translated in vitro and used to assess the RNA cleavage activity of the expressed RNases in conjunction with a guide RNA (crRNAs) and trRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 1a); both variants contain a V5-epitope tag sequence. crRNA and trRNA were derived from a genome segment of influenza virus A (IAV) (Supplementary Table 1). The RNaseAlert substrate fluorescence was the output of RNA cleavage. Cas13a and Cas13a-NLS RNA cleavage occurred only in the presence of both crRNA and trRNA but not in the presence of crRNA alone or a non-targeted crRNA (NTCR). RNA cleavage generated fluorescence, which increased to its maximum during the initial 10- and 20-min period, respectively, and then gradually decreased over time, likely due to photobleaching. The trend of RNA cleavage was similar for both Cas13a and Cas13a-NLS (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The products of the reactions were analyzed via gel electrophoresis, to visualize and quantify the product of the RNA cleavage activity—that is, the ‘RNA smear’ at the bottom of the gel (Supplementary Fig. 2). Our results demonstrated that, overall, the designed mRNAs express functional Cas13 proteins. Upon transfection of mRNA in A549 cells, LbuCas13a localized to the cytosol, and LbuCas13a-NLS had an additional nuclear distribution (Supplementary Fig. 3). Because, during infection, IAV is found both in the nucleus, where it replicates, and in the cytosol (Supplementary Fig. 4) of cells, both RNAses were concurrently further investigated.Endogenous gene knockdown via mRNA-based Cas13 expressionTo validate the mRNA-based approach, A549 cells were transfected with mRNA expressing LbuCas13a, with and without an NLS, and guides targeting the endogenous genes PPIB, CXCR4 and KRAS. Target gene knockdown was evaluated at 24 h via qPCR (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c and Supplementary Table 2). To date, most studies have evaluated only targeted reduction of RNA relative to the reduction due to an NTCR. Here, in addition to the NTCR, two additional controls were added: an mRNA expressing a ‘dead’ or inactive Cas13a plus targeted guide and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-encoding mRNA plus targeted guide. Each control yielded valuable information regarding how the guide was performing. The dead version gives insight into whether ‘binding-only’ events might affect RNA levels, whereas the GFP control adds additional information regarding whether the guide alone has knockdown effects. For PPIB, the controls, in general, acted as expected. The PPIB guides exhibited 57% and 53% knockdown via the cytosolic and NLS versions of LbuCas13a in 24 h, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5a). For CXCR4, unfortunately, the guides themselves, which used a published spacer sequence, significantly knocked down the mRNA by over 90% (Supplementary Fig. 5b) without Cas13a expression by a currently unknown mechanism. This is not necessarily a problem per se, but this control group helps distinguish ‘binding’-related knockdown from enzymatic effects. This information is important for establishing the mode of action of this therapeutic approach.For KRAS, the guides, instead, exhibited Cas13-mediated knockdown, 38% and 60%, via the cytosolic and NLS versions of LbuCas13a in 24 h, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5c). The data resulting from the CXCR4 experiments were surprising but clearly demonstrated the need for the additional controls when screening guides to ensure Cas13-mediated knockdown.For both PPIB and KRAS, the slight increase in gene expression observed in the NLS, dead Cas13 plus target guide and GFP plus target guide conditions is likely due to transfection, as GFP alone induced a similar increase (Supplementary Fig. 6). Because the controls did not significantly decrease RNA levels, knockdown was due only to the active enzyme.To address the occurrence of collateral RNase activity or off-target effects, the PPIB and KRAS knockdown experiments were repeated, and total RNA was extracted and processed for qPCR. The expression of 11 housekeeping genes and 18S rRNA were quantified by comparing the effect of the targeted guide to the NTCR. We observed no significant increase or decrease (fold change threshold = 2 and P value threshold P = 0.05) of gene expression with respect to the control condition (Supplementary Fig. 7) for either Cas13a or Cas13a-NLS.Screening of crRNAs targeting PB1 after infectionNext, five PB1 guides targeting both the viral genome and mRNA were designed and screened after infection (Supplementary Table 2). Here, A549 cells were first infected with influenza A/WSN/33 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01; 24 h after infection, mRNA and guides were delivered, and, at 48 h after infection, PB1 RNA levels were evaluated by qPCR. From this initial screen, one mRNA targeted guide (WSN33_PB1_m5) exhibited very strong knockdown, approximately 83% using the cytosolic Cas13a and 78% via the NLS version, during the 24-h period (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 8). None of the controls demonstrated ‘guide-only’ effects (Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Fig. 8), and even the dead version showed minimal knockdown, demonstrating that the effects were likely only from enzymatic action.Fig. 1: Cas13a-mediated IAV PB1 RNA knockdown after infection.a, Schematic representation of A/WSN/33 genome showing the localization of the crRNA guides. b, A549 cells were infected with IAV A/WSN/33 at MOI = 0.01.

NS, not significant.Source dataFull size imageExpanding the breath of guides against influenza: targeting PB2Clearly, for this approach to have high therapeutic value, the ability to target many strains of a given virus is advantageous. For influenza, a bioinformatic comparison of 108 influenza historical vaccine strains and candidate vaccine strains, with publicly available genome sequences, yielded several conserved regions across different subsets of strains (Fig. 2). We specifically focused on our so-called ‘Human’ subset, which included human seasonal H1N1, H1N1pdm09 and human seasonal H3N2 strains. From this analysis, a conserved region in PB2 was found, and six guides were designed against both viral mRNA and the genome of influenza (Supplementary Table 2). Guides with a stable stem-loop structure and targeting regions without substantial base pairing were selected using computational folding prediction tools, resulting in consistent ΔG = −2.74 for the whole sequence and a positive ΔG for the target sequence (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 3). Three guides were found to knockdown the viral RNA > 50%, delivered 24 h after infection and evaluated at 48 h after infection, with varying effectiveness in the nucleus and cytosol (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 9). Guides WSN33_PB2_m4 and WSN33_PB2_g2 both exhibited over 75% knockdown at the RNA level (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 9). These two guides were examined for breadth of protection, and, when the combination was compared with over 52,000 strains, over the last 100 years, they were exact matches with 99.1% of strains (Fig. 2e,f and Supplementary Table 4). This result was very encouraging toward the goal of a pan-influenza approach.Fig. 2: PB2 targeted guide selection and influenza A sequence coverage.a, Schematic overview of PB2 guide selection, validation, screening and coverage analysis. b, Breakdown of IAV candidate subtypes used for consensus searches.

NS, not significant.Full size imageScreening of crRNAs targeting PB2 after infection and in combination with a PB1 guideThe mRNA-targeted guide for PB1 was combined with both cytoplasmic and NLS-targeted Cas13a, and the combination was evaluated against a previously published small interfering RNA (siRNA)33. The use of the combination NLS and cytoplasmic Cas13a is justified by the variability of the distribution of viral ribonucleoproteins from cell to cell (Supplementary Fig. 4), and it yielded a ~15% increase in viral RNA knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 10). The mRNA-targeted guides for PB1 and PB2 were then combined with both cytoplasmic and NLS-targeted Cas13a, and the combination was evaluated both as a function of MOI and over time (Fig. 4). When the combination was evaluated in our standard screening assay, we clearly saw the benefits of the combination, yielding ~10% lower RNA values than with WSN33_PB1_m5 alone. When this combination was examined across MOI, it was clear that, at MOIs of 0.001 and 0.01, greater than 80% knockdown was achievable (Fig. 4a,b). The effect, though, might be increased if the enzymatic reaction is given more time and if the dose of mRNA and guide is increased. When the combination was evaluated over time at MOI = 0.01, the results demonstrated continued RNA reduction over a span of 72 h (Fig. 4c,d), with the peak difference from IAV and the NTCR at 48 h. It should be noted that we observed increased effects of the NTCR over time, likely due to low levels of NTCR overlap with native genes inducing activation. However, if the effect of the treatment or ‘drug’, Cas13a mRNA plus targeted guide, is compared with the IAV-only case, the approach was able to sustain 90% knockdown over the 3-d period.Fig. 4: Cas13a-mediated IAV PB1 RNA knockdown as a function of MOI and time course via combinations of targeted guides.a, A549 cells were infected with A/WSN/33 at MOI = 0.001, MOI = 0.01 or MOI = 0.1.

The nucleocapsid sites would also allow for the targeting of any of the subgenomic RNAs produced by the virus. In this experiment, nine different guides were screened, by first transfecting Vero E6 cells overnight with the cytoplasmic version of Cas13a and guides and then infecting with MOI = ~0.1 of SARS-CoV-2. Note that only the cytoplasmic version was used, because the virus replicates in the cytosol34. Prophylactic delivery was initially used because this virus exhibits very rapid kinetics in Vero E6 cells, as well as the fact that they are interferon deficient. CPE was evaluated at 72 h after infection. From this screen, guides N3.2 (nucleocapsid), N3.1 (nucleocapsid), R5.1 (replicase) and N11.2 (nucleocapsid) were found to affect CPE, with guide N3.2 (Fig. 5b) exhibiting the lowest CPE. This was repeated using both individual and combinations of guides including all the controls and the data quantified by image analysis, demonstrating for the combination of N3.2 and N11.2 over 72% reduction in cell death, with over 80% of cells remaining in the plate (Fig. 5c). In addition, the experiment was repeated by first infecting Vero E6 with MOI = ~0.1 of SARS-CoV-2 and then transfecting cells either 1 hour post infection (hpi) or 4 hpi. The CPE assay demonstrated significant (>50%) reduction in cell death (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 11). Finally, the RNAse activity of Cas13 against SARS-CoV-2 was measured in both Vero E6 and Huh7 cells. Three hours after SARS-CoV-2 infection at an MOI of 2, cells were transfected with Cas13 mRNA along with either the N3.2 or NTCR guide RNA. qPCR, performed at 24 hpi, demonstrated significant knockdown of both the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N genes (Fig. 5e). Targeted Cas13a mRNA delivery resulted in 93.7% and 94.5% reduction in RdRp copy number in Vero E6 and Huh7 cells, respectively. Similarly, Cas13a mRNA delivery along with guide N3.2 reduced N copy number by 94.1% and 99.1% in Vero E6 and Huh7 cells, respectively.Fig. 5: SARS-CoV-2 guide selection and in vitro testing.a, Schematic representation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genomes showing the localization of the crRNA guides and selection process. Nineteen sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from the Wuhan region were aligned with the Toronto 2 SARS-CoV isolate sequence, and regions in ORF1ab and N with complete coverage were identified. Guide target sequences were tiled across the conserved region and checked for correct folding. b, Cas13a mRNA along with the indicated guides against N, ORF1ab (R5.1) or NTCR were transfected in Vero E6 cells overnight before infection with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 0.1).

We designed a straightforward nose-cone nebulizer apparatus (Fig. 6a), which allows for up to three mice to be dosed simultaneously from a vibrating mesh nebulizer. PBAE was chosen for our formulation based on prior publication and lung delivery25. First, the final concentration of mRNA in the formulation was optimized using a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored nanoluciferase (aNLuc) encoding mRNA in the lung (Fig. 6b), yielding optimal expression in the lungs at 0.5 mg ml−1, as reported previously. Next, we determined whether influenza infection affects delivery. We infected mice with 3 lethal dose 50 (LD50) of influenza A/WSN/33 and then delivered aNLuc mRNA at 12 and 24 hpi as well as without infection (Fig. 6c,d). No significant differences in expression were observed, demonstrating efficient mRNA delivery and protein expression via nebulizer in the face of influenza infection. Finally, aNLuc mRNA was fluorescently labeled before delivery by nose-cone nebulization35,36. Four hours after delivery, mice were sacrificed, and lungs were extracted for IVIS imaging and fluorescence analysis of mRNA distribution within the organ. No significant differences in protein expression were measured between labeled and unlabeled mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 12). Confocal imaging revealed widespread distribution of labeled mRNA throughout the lungs (Supplementary Fig. 12).Fig. 6: Inhalable antiviral Cas13a mRNA in rodents.a, Apparatus for mouse studies. b, 100 µg of aNLuc mRNA formulated was delivered to mice at the indicated final mRNA concentration.

Six hours after infection, one group was given, by nose-cone nebulizer, 100 µg of mRNA-encoding Cas13a (with and without NLS) and guide (WSN/33_PB1_m5) or an NTCR formulated with the PBAE-based polymer. Control groups included mice given 100 mg of Cas13a mRNA with an NTCR guide as well as an infection-only group. Mice body weight was recorded daily, and mice were euthanized 3 d after infection, when weight had dropped by ~15% in the NTCR condition (Fig. 6e). The viral RNA in mice lungs was quantified by qPCR. Analysis revealed an 89.1% (P = 0.0097) reduction of viral RNA from NTCR (Fig. 6f) and a 96.2% (P = 0.0001) from IAV only (Supplementary Fig. 13), demonstrating robust knockdown of viral RNA in vivo.Mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo using the hamster model of infectionOnce we observed Cas13 function and IAV RNA degradation in vivo, we then tested whether Cas13 could mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infections in the hamster model using body weight reduction prevention as a clinically relevant metric for success26,27,28. Given the size discrepancy between mice and Syrian hamsters, a modified nebulization apparatus was developed using larger-diameter animal restraints and 3D-printed nose cones but retaining the same nebulizer (Fig. 6g). Using a Cas13-nanoluciferase mRNA reporter, varying doses were tested, and 125 µg of mRNA was sufficient to induce robust expression (Fig. 6h,i). Next, 125 µg of mRNA-encoding Cas13a (without NLS) and guide (N3.2), formulated with the PBAE-based polymer, were delivered to the hamsters via the nose-cone nebulizer. Hamsters were infected with 103 plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) via intranasal administration 20 h later. Control groups included mice given Cas13a mRNA with an NTCR guide, as well as an infection-only and mock group. Hamster body weights were recorded daily before euthanasia at 6 d after infection, and a clear difference was observed between the treated and untreated groups (Fig. 6j). We then used two different multiple linear regression models to analyze the weight data. First, we measured no statistical difference between the uninfected animals and the group that received the targeted guide (P = 0.111), demonstrating the ability of Cas13 to sufficiently alter SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in this model to abrogate weight loss (Supplementary Table 6). Both the NTCR (P = 0.0031) and infection-only (P = 0.0003) groups were statistically different from uninfected animals. Furthermore, we determined that the weight difference between the N3.2 and uninfected animals diverged quadratically with P = 0.00043 (Supplementary Table 7). In addition, hamster lung viral N RNA copy number was examined by qPCR at day 6 (Fig. 6k). We measured a significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 copy number of 57% in the N3.2-treated animals relative to the NTCR and virus-only conditions.DiscussionRNA viruses pose challenges for drug and vaccine development and are a global health concern. Unconventional molecular tools like RNA-activated RNases, such as Cas13a, could be a potential new paradigm for therapeutics against these pathogens. However, for the RNA targeting RNases to be safe and effective for therapeutic use, rapid, transient expression is preferred37. To achieve this, we opted for synthetic in vitro transcribed mRNA to express Cas13a. mRNA has the advantage of rapid translation of the desired protein, and it avoids safety concerns such as genome integration and unmitigated innate immune responses20,21,38,39,40.Using this all-RNA-based approach, we found crRNA guides that targeted both the genome and the mRNA of influenza effectively, even when given 24 h after infection. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration, to date, that this approach can be used after infection. There was a clear bias toward mRNA targeted guides, consistent with prior work using siRNA against influenza33. In addition, even though we were not able to find guides that were truly pan-influenza, they clearly overlap with over 52,000 strains, making significant strides toward this goal. Previous studies did not target polymerase genes. It is our contention that they are excellent targets owing to their clear role in generating viral RNA and the fact they are so well conserved. We also demonstrated how this approach scales with MOI and is functional over a 3-d period, even when using transient transfection of mRNA. The time-course data demonstrated the ability of Cas13a to degrade RNA at a rate equal to or more rapidly than the rate of RNA generation from viral replication. This has not been addressed to date. The data clearly show that, over the 3-d period after delivery, Cas13a kept RNA levels consistently ~1 log lower than without treatment. Future work will address how dose and Cas13 species affect these dynamics. A future therapeutic approach would most certainly contain multiple guides. We have demonstrated the use of two guides at once, but likely more guides will be used simultaneously, within the identified highly conserved regions, to prevent viral escape.We then addressed the question: can this approach be applied directly to newly emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2? From our results, it is clear that Cas13a can have significant effects on CPE, a well-established measure of antiviral activity41, or viral RNA levels when given before or after infection. These results clearly demonstrate the adaptability of this approach and its flexibility. Different guide sequences are sufficient to target either IAV or SARS-CoV-2. By delivering the nuclear or the cytoplasmic versions of Cas13, or both together, the replication and dynamics of different viruses can be significantly affected.Finally, we answered a critical question regarding Cas13: can it be used in vivo against respiratory viruses? First, we formulated the mRNA with PBAE-based polymer and delivered it after infection using a nebulizer that is currently used by humans, simulating a treatment strategy, and demonstrated that Cas13 can degrade influenza viral RNA in vivo efficiently. Next, we assessed Cas13 effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Syrian hamster model and demonstrated that a single dose was sufficient to alter the pathophysiology of the infection, as indicated by the body weight and lung viral RNA data. Although we observed only a modest decrease in lung viral load, given the small sample size (n = 4), this is supported by the weak correlation between viral load and weight that was previously reported this model30. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of Cas13 mitigation, in vivo, of two important respiratory pathogens, in two different animal species. Our results bode well for addressing other infections. Future work will include more interrogations of delivery timing, as well as further development of mRNA carriers for the lung. Overall, this work demonstrates progress toward the use of this of Cas13 to treat respiratory viral infections.MethodsDesign and synthesis of Cas13a constructs and anchored nanoluciferase mRNAThe Cas13a sequence from Leptotrichia buccalis was obtained from Addgene (p2CT-His-MBP-Lbu_C2C2_WT, plasmid no. 83482). We cloned the wild-type Cas13a with a 3′ V5 tag (Cas13a-V5) and appended a 3′ untranslated region (UTR) from mouse alpha-globin (GenBank accession no. NM_001083955) in a pMA7 vector (GeneArt, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Additionally, we synthesized a construct with the Cas13a sequence from the L. buccalis along with an NLS sequence (at 3′ and 5′) and a 3′ V5 tag to create a Cas13a-V5-NLS version using GeneBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies). For both constructs, we synthesized catalytically inactive versions (dCas13a-V5 and dCas13a-V5-NLS). The sequences were obtained fron Addgene (plasmid no. 100817). The sequences of the GPI anchor and nanoluciferase are described in Lindsay et al.35.In vitro transcription of Cas13aPlasmids were linearized with Not-I HF (New England Biolabs) overnight at 37 °C. Linearized templates were purified by sodium acetate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) precipitation and rehydrated with nuclease-free water. In vitro transcription was performed overnight at 37 °C using the HiScribe T7 Kit (NEB) following the manufacturer’s instructions (N1-methyl-pseudouridine modified). The resulting RNA was treated with DNase I (Aldevron) for 30 min to remove the template, and it was purified using lithium chloride precipitation (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RNA was heat denatured at 65 °C for 10 min before capping with a Cap-1 structure using guanylyl transferase and 2′-O-methyltransferase (Aldevron). mRNA was then purified by lithium chloride precipitation, treated with alkaline phosphatase (NEB) and purified again. mRNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop. mRNA stock concentrations were 1–3 mg ml−1. Purified mRNA products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis to ensure purity. crRNA guides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies or GenScript. The sequences are detailed in Supplementary Table 2.RNA cleavage activity of in vitro translated of Cas13aCas13a mRNA was translated in vitro using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). RNaseAlert-1 Substrate was mixed with crRNA or NTCR (500 nM) and trRNA (500 nM) in RNA processing buffer, consisting of A549 cells RNA (100 ng), 20 mM HEPES (pH 6.8), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, BSA (10 µg ml−1), yeast tRNA (10 µg ml−1), 0.01% Igepal CA-630 and 5% glycerol (Supplementary Table 1)15. This mixture was added cold to the translated Cas13a lysate (5 µl) in the 96-well plate wells and mixed well. All the reagent preparations and additions were performed on ice. The fluorescence measurements (excitation 485 ± 20 nm/emission 528 ± 20 nm) were recorded at room temperature for 90 min at 10-min intervals. The RNA cleavage products were run on a 15% TBE-urea gel. The gel was stained with SYBR Gold for 30 min and visualized under ultraviolet illumination. The gel was analyzed using Image Studio Lite quantification software (version 5.2, LI-COR) to quantify the intensity of the cleavage products (RNA smear).Cell lines and virusesAll cell lines and viruses were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Human lung epithelial cells A549 (CCL185), MDCK, Huh7 and Vero E6 were grown in media recommended by the ATCC. Guide screening experiments for IAV were performed in A549 cells. Guide screening experiments for SARS-CoV-2 were performed in Vero E6 cells. Influenza virus stocks (H1N1 influenza virus A/WSN/33) were prepared in MDCK cells. Briefly, MDCK cells were grown until 100% confluence in 175 mm2. The next day, cells were washed twice with PBS, and 1:1,000 dilution of virus was added in 5 ml of EMEM. Cells were then incubated with the virus for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker. Then, 25 ml of media was added to the cells. Cells were monitored for 72 h or until a severe CPE was observed. Virus was collected by centrifuging the cells at 1,000g for 10 min. Virus titers were determined by standard plaque assay.SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) was obtained from BEI Resources. Viral stocks were generated by infecting Vero E6 cells (ATCC, C1008) at ~95% confluency in 150-cm2 flasks with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 PFU per cell. At 68 h after infection, supernatants were collected, pooled and centrifuged at 400g for 10 min. The resulting stock was aliquoted, titered and stored at −80 °C for further use. All work with live SARS-CoV-2 was performed inside a certified Class II Biosafety Cabinet in a Biological Safety Level (BSL)-3 laboratory in compliance with all state and federal guidelines and with the approval of the University of Georgia Institutional Biosafety Committee.Immunofluorescence assaysFor all immunofluorescence assays, after the specified treatment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.02% Triton-X for 5 min and blocked with 5% BSA for 30 min. The primary antibodies used were the mouse monoclonal anti-influenza A H1N1, nucleoprotein (G20) (1:1,000, Kerafast EFD002) and the rabbit anti-V5 tag (1:250, Abcam, ab9116). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse (1:250, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21202) and Alexa Fluor 546 donkey anti-rabbit (1:250, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10040). All antibodies were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were routinely stained with DAPI before mounting with Prolong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 v2 sCMOS camera on a PerkinElmer UltraView spinning disk confocal microscope mounted to a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M body with a ×63 NA 1.4 plan-apochromat objective. Images were acquired with Volocity Acquisition Software (version 6.3.3, PerkinElmer) with z-stack intervals of 200 nm. Images were linearly contrast enhanced for visual clarity. Images were uniformly contrast enhanced across an experiment.Optimization of mRNA transfectionA549 cells were seeded overnight at a density of 120,000–130,000 per well in a 24-well plate. The next day, cells were transfected with mRNA encoding for Cas13a variants and either targeted crRNA or non-targeted crRNA guides (NTCR) using Lipofectamine Messenger Max (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions. Dead Cas13 constructs encoding mRNAs and GFP-encoding mRNA were also used as controls to assess the effect of Cas13a targeted binding and mRNA transfection/guides alone, respectively, on gene expression. For each well, 0.5 µg of mRNA and 1.5 µl of Messenger Max were used. crRNA guides and NTCR were added to the transfection mix at 20× molar guide:mRNA ratio in all endogenous gene knockdown experiments (PPIB, CXCR4 and KRAS). The sequences of the previously published crRNA guides10 are detailed in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. For each well, 10 pmol siRNA and 1.5 µl of Messenger Max were used (Dharmacon; cat. no. PB1-2257, ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting siRNA #1).Twenty-four hours after transfection, total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR experiments were performed using the FastAdvanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cas13-mediated degradation of PPIB, CXCR4 and KRAS mRNA was assayed by qPCR with the ΔΔCT method (n = 3) using GAPDH as control. Experiments were performed using a QuantStudio7 Flex thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) using the QuantStudio7 software (version 1.3). All primer/probe assays for endogenous gene experiments were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Supplementary Table 8).Evaluation of off-target effectsCells were transfected with Cas13a or Cas13a-NLS and 20× molar excess of guides against PPIB or KRAS or NTCR as described. After 24 h, total RNA was extracted and quantified. cDNA was prepared using the RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions. The expression of housekeeping genes was evaluated via qPCR using the SYBR Green-based commercially available RT2 housekeeping gene array (Qiagen) and analyzed using the RT2 Profiler PCR data. Analysis software is available online. The same cDNA samples were analyzed for 18S expression using the FastAdvanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Taqman primer/probe assays using GAPDH as an endogenous control (Supplementary Table 8).In vitro antiviral assay with IAVA549 cells were seeded overnight at a density of 120,000–130,000 per well in a 24-well plate. The next day, cells were washed with 1× PBS and infected by adding 100 µl of influenza virus diluted in serum-free media with TPCK for 1 h. The cells were then washed with 1× PBS, and complete media with TPCK were added for 24 h. Cells were then transfected with mRNA encoding for Cas13a and either targeted crRNA or non-targeted crRNA guides (NTCR) using Lipofectamine Messenger Max (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions. Dead Cas13 constructs encoding mRNAs and GFP-encoding mRNA were also used as controls. For each well, 0.5 µg of mRNA and 1.5 µl of Messenger Max were used. crRNA guides and NTCR were added to the transfection mix at 50× molar guide:mRNA ratio in all IVA-based experiments. The sequences of the crRNA guides and ΔG values are detailed in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. The sequences of the IAV strains used to design the guides against PB2 are available upon request from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Unless otherwise specified, 24 h after transfection, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit. cDNA was prepared using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR experiments were performed using the FastAdvanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The antiviral activity of Cas13a system was measured by qPCR (n = 6) with the absolute quantification of the viral PB1 or PB2 gene copy number. RT–qPCR technical triplicates were performed to determine biological replicate values. Experiments were performed using a QuantStudio7 Flex thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems).In the ‘combo experiments’, for each well, 0.25 µg of each mRNA Cas13a and Cas13a-NLS and 1.5 µl of Messenger Max were used. Each crRNA guide was added to the transfection mix at 25× molar guide:mRNA ratio. The sequences of the primer/probe assays for PB1 and PB2 for H1N1 influenza virus A/WSN/33 are listed in Supplementary Table 8.In vitro antiviral assay with SARS-CoV-2Vero E6 cells were seeded overnight at ~80% confluency in a six-well plate. The next day, cells were transfected with mRNA encoding for Cas13a-V5 and either targeted crRNA or non-targeted crRNA guides (NTCR) using Lipofectamine Messenger Max (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer instructions. For each well, 5 µg of mRNA and 7.5 µl of Messenger Max were used. crRNA guides and NTCR were added to the transfection mix at 50× molar guide:mRNA ratio (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). In the ‘combo experiments’, for each well, 5 µg of Cas13a and 7.5 µl of Messenger Max were used. Each crRNA guide was added to the transfection mix to maintain the 50× molar guide:mRNA ratio. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, plates were transferred to the BSL-3 for infection. The medium was removed, and cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 45–60 min at an MOI of ~0.1 PFU per cell. After infection, cells were overlayed with 1× DMEM with 1% FBS containing 1.2% Avicel RC-581 and incubated for 72 h. The overlay was removed and cells were rinsed with 1× PBS and fixed/stained with a crystal violet solution containing 2% methanol and 4% formaldehyde for 10 min. In post-infection experiments, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 45–60 min at an MOI of ~0.1 PFU per cell. Either 1 h or 4 h after infection, cells were transfected with 5 µg of Cas13a and 7.5 µl of Messenger Max and incubated for 72 h before fixation and staining. Images for presentation were white balanced, and intensities for analysis were not modified for calculations. All images were brought into Photoshop, converted to grayscale and color inverted. A region of interest of the same size was then used for all images, and the sum intensity was calculated by Volocity. Intensities were normalized to a blank region of each image to account for image-to-image variation. Signal was then normalized to the mock condition to yield a percent live cell area.Animal studiesSix- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories) were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in individually ventilated and watered cages kept at negative pressure. Mice were kept in rooms on a 12-h light/dark cycle with ambient temperature between 22.8 and 23.9 °C with 30–40% relative humidity. Food was provided to mice ad libitum. Animals were acclimatized for at least 6 d before the beginning of experiments. Animals were randomly distributed among experimental groups. Researchers were blinded to animal group allocation during data acquisition. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. Infected animals were handled and kept under BSL-2 conditions until euthanized.Hamster delivery optimization experiments were performed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Four-week-old male LVG Golden Syrian Hamsters (Charles River Laboratories) were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in individually ventilated and watered cages kept at negative pressure. Hamsters were kept in rooms on a 12-h light/dark cycle with ambient temperature between 21.1 and 22.8 °C with 35–50% relative humidity. Food was provided to hamsters ad libitum. Animals were acclimatized for at least 6 d before beginning experiments. Animals were randomly distributed among experimental groups. Researchers were blinded to animal group allocation during data acquisition. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation.All animals were cared for according to the Georgia Institute of Technology Physiological Research Laboratory policies and under ethical guidance from the university’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee following National institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines.Hamster infections were performed at the University of Georgia. Outbred male LVG Golden Syrian hamsters, 3–4 weeks of age, were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Hamsters were housed inside an animal BSL-3 room in a HEPA-filtered cageack system and provided food and water ad libitum. Animals were randomly assigned to groups by animal care staff blinded as to study design and treatment. Hamsters were acclimatized before use. Animals were cared for according to the University of Georgia Animal Health Research Center policies and under ethical guidance from the university’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee following NIH guidelines.Nebulizer-based mRNA deliveries to mice and hamstersMice were loaded into a custom-built nose-only exposure system constructed of a clear PVC tee and animal restraints (CODA Small Mouse Holder, Kent Scientific). These were connected using a custom 3D-printed nose cone (3D Printing Tech) made of a flexible TPU material. The nebulizer (Aeroneb, Kent Scientific) was then placed on the upward facing port of the tee. Doses were added dropwise to the nebulizer at a rate of 25 µl per mouse per droplet. After each individual droplet was nebulized, the clear tee was inspected until the vaporized dose had cleared (approximately 15–45 s per drop). Droplets were added until the desired dose per animal was achieved. After the vapor had cleared after the last droplet, the mice were removed from the restraints.For delivery of mRNA to hamsters, the exposure system was modified with larger animal restraints (CODA Large Mouse Holder, Kent Scientific) and a larger 3D-printed nose cone to fit the larger restraints. To account for the increase in tidal volume in hamsters compared to mice, doses were added dropwise to the nebulizer at a rate of 62.5 µl per hamster per droplet.mRNA was formulated for nebulizer-based delivery using a hyperbranched PBAE as previously described25 with minor modifications. Diacrylate and amine monomers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. To synthesize hyperbranched hDD90-118, acrylate:backbone amine:trifunctional amine monomers were reacted modifying the ratio at 1:0.59:0.40. Monomers were stirred in anhydrous dimethylformamide at a concentration of 150 mg ml−1 at 40 °C for 4 h and then 90 °C for 48 h. The mixtures were allowed to cool to 30 °C, and end cap amine was added at 1.0 molar equivalent relative to the acrylate and stirred for an additional 24 h. The polymers were purified by dropwise precipitation into cold anhydrous diethyl ether spiked with glacial acetic acid, vortexed and centrifuged at 1,250g for 2 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the polymer was washed twice more in fresh diethyl ether and dried under vacuum for 48 h. This step was repeated until the supernatant in the precipitation process became transparent. Polymers were stored at −20 °C.Before delivery to animals, 100 mM of sodium acetate pH 5.0 was used to both solubilize the hyperbranched PBAE and dilute mRNA before mixing. The final concentration of the mRNA was 0.5 mg ml−1, and the PBAE was used at a 50× molar ratio to the mRNA. The tubes were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and the particles were loaded into the nebulizer as described above.After euthanasia, whole lungs were collected and rinsed with PBS. Lungs were then placed into a solution of Nano-Glo substrate solution (Promega) diluted 50-fold in PBS. Lungs were incubated for 5 min and then placed onto black paper and imaged with an IVIS Spectrum CT (PerkinElmer). Lung luminescence was then quantified using Living Image software (version 4.7.4, PerkinElmer).mRNA distribution in mice lungsTo assess the distribution of aNLuc-encoding mRNA within mice lungs upon nebulization, four oligonucleotides (Biosearch Technologies) complementary to the mRNA’s 3′ UTR were designed with the following sequences: MT1 5′-thiol-XTTTTTXGCAAGCCCCGCAGAAGX-3′, MT2 5′-thiol-TXTTATTXAGAGAAGAAGGGCAXGG-3′, MT3 5′-thiol-XTTTTTXACCAAGAGGXACAGGXGC-3′ and MT4 5′-thiol-XTTTTTTCXACUCAGGCXUUAUXC-3′, where the boldface indicates 2′-O-methyl RNA and X indicates T(C6-amino) modifications. The oligos were labeled with Cy3B NHS-ester dye according to manufacturer instructions and were annealed to the anchored VHH-encoding mRNA as previously described36. The resulting fluorescently labeled mRNA was delivered to mice via nose-cone nebulization. Four hours after delivery, mice were euthanized, and lungs were isolated and processed for O.C.T. embedding. Tissue blocks in O.C.T. were immediately snap frozen in dry ice-cooled isopentane and sectioned using a cryostat in 10-μm-thick tissue sections. Tissue sections were used to evaluate the distribution of nebulized mRNA in the lungs. Lungs from untreated animals were used as controls. Images were acquired via confocal microscopy and processed as above.Influenza viral load quantification from lung tissuesMice were infected intranasally with 3 LD50 influenza virus using 20 µl per nostril after brief anaesthesia by isoflurane. Virus was diluted in DMEM without modifications to the desired PFU dose. After euthanasia, lungs were harvested into PBS before downstream assays.Lungs were dissociated as described previously39. Briefly, lungs were weighed before dissociation using a GentleMACS in a C Tube using the ‘lung 2’ setting (Miltenyi). After centrifugation at room temperature for 5 min at 500g, pellets were lysed in RLT Plus buffer (Qiagen) and further homogenized using NAVY tubes in a Bullet Blender (Next Advance). Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C and maximum speed to clarify the supernatant. Total RNA was then extracted following a RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) per manufacturer instructions. cDNA synthesis and qPCR were then performed as detailed above with the absolute quantification of the viral PB1 gene copy number.SARS-CoV-2 infections and RNA extractionHamsters were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 100 mg kg−1 of ketamine/5 mg kg−1 of xylazine. After loss of toe pinch reflex, SARS-CoV-2 was administered to each via intranasal route in a volume of 50 µl. Animals were then administered reversal agent (atipamezole, 0.15 mg kg−1) and placed on a heating pad until able to right themselves. Body weights and clinical signs were checked and recorded daily. For sample collection, hamsters were anesthetized as described above and administered pentobarbital (100 mg kg−1) via intraperitoneal injection. After exsanguination and pneumothorax, tissues were collected aseptically for analyses.Whole lungs from individual hamsters were placed in 2 ml of DMEM 1% FBS containing antibiotics/antimycotics (D1) in C tubes and homogenized using a GentleMACS machine at ‘lung 2’ setting (Miltenyi). After centrifugation for 10 min at 1,000g, supernatant was removed, and remaining homogenates were resuspended in Trizol for RNA extraction. Chloroform-based phase separation and RNA precipitation was then performed followed by two ethanol washes.SARS-CoV-2 qPCR measurementscDNA was synthesized from cellular RNA extracted from cells or hamster lung tissue samples using a specific primer 5′- TCCTTTTTAGGCTCTGTTGGTGGG-3′ complementary to the 3′ end of the viral genomic RNA using the iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). qPCR was performed using either an RdRp region primer set (forward: 5′-GAATAGAGCTCGCACCGTAGCTGG-3′ and reverse: 5′-GCTAGCCACTAGACCTTGAGATGCAT-3′) or a nucleocapsid (N) region primer set (forward: 5′-GGCCAACAACAACAAGGCCAAACTGTC-3′ and reverse: 5′-GTCCTTTTTAGGCTCTGT TGGTGGG-3′) to amplify the cDNA using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). A Quant Studio 3 system (Applied Biosystems) was used for qPCR. The cycling parameters were 95 °C for 4 min followed by 95 °C for 10 s, 56 °C for 45 s, 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 10 s and 95 °C for 10 s. Each sample was assayed in duplicate. The RNA genome copy number per liter was calculated using the average of the duplicate cycle threshold values and a standard curve constructed using viral RNA extracted from virions and quantified using nanodrop (NanoDrop 2000, version 1.6.198).Statistical analysesAll experiments are represented as a mean of three or six biological replicates as indicated. Power analyses for group sizes were calculated using G*Power (version 3.1, University of Dusseldorf). Data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism 8. Statistical analyses were performed between groups using either ordinary one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as specified in individual figure captions. Hamster weight data were analyzed using a multiple linear regression model using regressors against weight data in Microsoft Excel, version 2009. Regression was performed with two different sets of regressors: 1) day, virus only, NTCR, N3.2, delivery flag (on the day of delivery) and infection flag (on the day of infection), all compared against the mock group; or 2) day, day2× (mock or NTCR), and infection flag (on all days after infection), all compared to the 3.2 and virus-only groups.Reporting SummaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The virus surface (yellow) is covered with proteins called hemagglutinin (blue) and neuraminidase (red) that enable the virus to enter and infect human cells. For more information, NIAID What An experimental single-dose, intranasal influenza vaccine was safe and produced a durable immune response when tested in a Phase 1 study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. The investigational vaccine, called Ad4-H5-VTN, is a recombinant, replicating adenovirus vaccine designed to spur antibodies to hemagglutinin, a protein found on the surface of influenza viruses that attaches to human cells. The investigational vaccine was developed by Emergent Biosolutions Inc., (Gaithersburg, Maryland). It was administered intranasally (28 study participants), as an oral capsule (10 participants) and via a tonsillar swab (25 participants) to healthy men and non-pregnant women ages 18 to 49 years. The participants who received the vaccine intranasally or via tonsillar swab showed significantly higher H5-specific neutralizing antibody levels compared to the group receiving the vaccine capsule orally. The participants who received the intranasal vaccine shed viral DNA for two-to-four weeks, but virus could be cultured for a median of only one day. Participants had evidence of H5-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Additionally, volunteers who received the intranasal vaccine had high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies at 26 weeks after vaccination, and this level was unchanged at three to five years after a single intranasal dose of the vaccine. The duration of viral shedding correlated with a high magnitude of neutralizing antibody response at week 26. In addition, the intranasal vaccine induced a mucosal antibody response in the nose, mouth, and rectum. The study authors speculate that replication-competent vector vaccines may have advantages over other types of vaccines because they can express viral proteins at higher levels and for longer durations. Additionally, this type of vaccine induces a mucosal immune response that is critical for limiting transmission of viruses that infect mucosal tissues. The vaccine platform could be highly adaptable for use against other viruses including HIV and SARS-CoV-2, according to the authors. Article K Matsuda et al.

Paired with the ongoing battle with COVID-19, medical experts from NewYork-Presbyterian medical groups say we could have a “twindemic” on our hands — an influenza epidemic unfolding in the middle of a relentless COVID-19 pandemic.The 2019 influenza virus caused an estimated 35 million illnesses in the U.S. The severity of this year’s flu season is unpredictable, but a lot of people may be coughing and sneezing, so the likelihood of transmission is much higher when you’re having active symptoms.But what exactly are those symptoms? Just as in the spring when it was difficult to tell the difference between seasonal allergies and COVID-19, the challenge now will be identifying what could be signs of COVID-19 vs. flu.COVID-19 vs. Flu: What’s the Difference?Medical experts say that it may be very hard to tell the difference between influenza and COVID. Therefore, although we outline the differences below, it is recommended to call your doctor to ensure the diagnosis and that you take the proper steps.Even though the flu and COVID-19 are caused by two totally different viruses, they share a number of symptoms:FeverFatigueCoughSore throatRunny noseShortness of breathBody achesHeadachesVomitingDiarrheaThere are, however, two distinct differences between the flu and the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.First, the loss of taste and smell is specific to COVID-19 and is not seen in people who have the flu. While it does not happen in all patients, this is a very important difference that can help distinguish between symptoms of flu and COVID-19 (about 38% to 55% of patients have reported loss of taste and around 40% have reported loss of smell). This specific symptom might come on anywhere from two days after contracting the virus to up to 14 days after symptom onset.Second, the way in which symptoms present themselves in patients is very different. Both the flu and COVID-19 cause a cough and shortness of breath, but overall, COVID-19 symptoms tend to last longer than the flu. Medical experts say COVID-19 symptoms may last for several weeks if not months.Shortness of breath can also come later with COVID-19 and becomes more severe and long-lasting than the flu.There are also some new and ongoing reports of symptoms associated with COVID-19 that people should be on the lookout for:Red, swollen eyes. There have been occasional reports of red, swollen, and itchy eyes in some COVID-19 patients, which can look like conjunctivitis (or pink eye). This is a symptom that can come on with other strains of coronavirus, so while not a distinguishing factor for COVID-19 specifically, it’s something to be watchful for.Skin rashes. Viruses are often associated with rashes, so it’s not unusual for you or your child to develop one. Mostly reported in younger people, early data suggests that different skin conditions may coincide with COVID-19. These may range from little red bumps and hives to chilblains — now temporarily called ‘COVID toes’ — which are painful, red-purple, or itchy bumps on the toes.If you or your child has any new skin condition or rash, call your doctor just to be safe. Since it can be hard for a clinician to distinguish whether a skin rash is from a COVID-19 infection or, say, hand, foot, and mouth disease (a viral infection that manifests as painful mouth sores and blisters on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet), your doctor will likely want to test you or your child for COVID-19.How to Tell the Difference Between COVID-19 vs. Flu in ChildrenReports have shown that COVID-19 is less severe in children than it is in adults. It’s also rare, making up about 1% to 2% of COVID-19 cases worldwide. That being said, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), while rare, is a condition associated with COVID-19 and can occur in children ranging from toddlers to teens. Lookout for symptoms, including fever, vomiting, lethargy, and abdominal pain. If your child is experiencing common flu symptoms coupled with any of the above symptoms, contact their pediatrician.What to Do if You Think You Have the Flu, COVID-19 — or BothYes, it’s possible to test positive for the flu and COVID-19 at the same time, but experts say the chances of having a coinfection are very, very low. If you find yourself experiencing any of the symptoms discussed in this article, here’s a game plan for how to quickly determine a diagnosis.Talk to your doctor. If you’re coming down with a telltale sign of COVID-19 or the flu, seek medical care. Experts say it’s a good idea to put on a mask and self-isolate from your family if you have symptoms, to play it safe. Get tested. Experts agree that it’s important to be tested as quickly as possible for COVID-19 and flu. Here’s some good news: The nose swab can be used to test for both COVID-19 and the flu. Schedule an appointment with your doctor or local health clinic, or visit an urgent care center where tests should be available.Start treatment. After a diagnosis, move forward with the appropriate treatment. For the flu, the gold standard is an antiviral drug that your doctor might prescribe which helps to lessen the severity of symptoms and shorten duration of the illness. For milder cases of COVID-19, most people can recover at home by monitoring their symptoms, resting, and drinking fluids.If you are having trouble breathing, persistent pain, chest pressure, new confusion, an inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face, seek emergency medical care immediately.How to Protect Yourself Against the Flu and COVID-19If there was ever a year when you were going to get a flu shot, this is the year. Call your doctor to make an appointment.To avoid a potential “twindemic” this year, medical experts at NewYork-Presbyterian medical groups recommend taking the following precautions:Get a flu shot. Call your doctor now to schedule an appointment to get your flu shot, as you should receive it prior to the COVID-19 vaccine.Practice safety precautions. Fortunately, the preventive measures for COVID-19 also apply for the flu: avoiding large crowds and gatherings, wearing a mask, social distancing, frequent handwashing, and staying at home when you feel sick.Take care of your immune system. Caring for your immune system is very important to fight off infections, especially viruses. Boost your immunity by eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep.For more articles about science, care, and wellness, visit healthmatters.nyp.org.

Sanders, Joshua S. Graff Zivin, Matthew J. Neidell and Gregor Singer·October 6, 2021 University of California, San Diego, Columbia University, Cornell University, and University of California, San Diego The Issue: Poor air quality has a lot of negative consequences: it shortens our lifespans, hinders learning, damages our brains, and makes us less productive at work. Environmental regulations are one tool for keeping pollution levels in check, but the 2020 wildfires that raged throughout California highlight the ubiquity of air pollution outside the scope of regulations. There’s emerging evidence to support one surprising action that people can take to help guard against one of the harms from unexpected increases in air pollution: getting a flu shot. The flu leads to more hospitalizations when there is more air pollution. Vaccination against the flu could mitigate this negative impact of pollution. The Facts: Seasonal influenza is a large and recurring danger in the United States. There are an estimated 25 million to 50 million cases of influenza each year, and the flu accounts for 225,000 hospitalizations and ultimately more than 20,000 deaths yearly. The majority of deaths (>90%) occur among elderly persons, usually those with chronic underlying health conditions. Despite the flu’s large burden, only about half of American adults receive a flu shot each year, far below the 70% target that the Department of Health and Human Services set for flu vaccination rates in 2010. The vaccination protects the person receiving the shot from the flu and also helps reduce virus transmission to others. Pollution makes flu season worse by increasing influenza hospitalizations. A number of medical studies suggest air pollution can make individuals more susceptible to respiratory illnesses, including influenza. In our new working paper, we show that periods of worse air quality are followed by periods of increased hospitalizations due to influenza, even after taking into account weather, season, and common regional differences in air quality and demographics. Using the Air Quality Index (AQI), a measure developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to describe dangers to human health from poor air quality, we find a clear positive correlation between higher AQI (worse air quality) and the hospitalization rate for influenza. A standard deviation increase in the AQI results in approximately 7,800 additional influenza hospitalizations during flu season across the United States. Given the persistent disparity in exposure to air pollution across U.S. regions, these results could provide one potential contributing factor for the puzzling finding that minority groups in the United States have substantially higher influenza hospitalization rates (see here). An effective and widespread flu vaccine can help reduce the dangers of air pollution. If one of the negative impacts of pollution is a heightened risk of hospitalizations from the flu, then vaccination against the flu could mitigate this harm by reducing the spread and severity of influenza. Due to random shifts in the influenza strain, the effectiveness of the flu vaccine varies across years. Since health officials started tracking it in 2003, effectiveness has varied from year to year, ranging from a low of 10% in 2004-05 to a high of 60% in 2010-11 (see here). We find that in years with greater vaccine effectiveness the link between air quality and influenza hospitalizations disappears (see chart). In other words, more effective vaccines negate the effect of poor air quality on influenza hospitalizations. Since the share of people protected by a vaccine is the product of vaccine take-up and vaccine effectiveness, this finding means that higher take-up shares could have the same moderating effect as higher vaccine effectiveness. Air quality regulations and vaccine programs are complementary health programs when it comes to reducing flu hospitalizations. Given the random nature of some pollution shocks such as wildfires, and the uncertainty of the annual strain match for influenza, programs designed to improve air quality and increase vaccine take-up can each help hedge against the risk of bad flu outcomes. A back of the envelope calculation suggests a 10% reduction in our pollution measure during an ineffective vaccine year (17% effectiveness) with an average vaccine take-up would avert 16.6% of all influenza-associated hospitalizations across the U.S. Meanwhile a 10% improvement in vaccine take-up at the average vaccine effectiveness (or, equivalently, a 10% improvement in vaccine effectiveness at the average vaccine take-up) in a historically polluted year (38.2 AQI) would avert 34.6% of pollution driven influenza hospitalizations. As fire season lengthens and extends into flu season, influenza season will become more hazardous and expensive. Both the length of fire season and its intensity have risen in recent years. The global average fire season has lengthened nearly 20% over the past few decades, and the frequency of large fires in the western United States has increased dramatically since the 1970s, with about 20 additional large fires per decade (see here). Pollution from wildfires has disastrous effects on air quality, which sometimes extend thousands of miles. Air monitor data shows that during the 2020 wildfires, the concentrations for the smallest monitored particulate in parts of the west coast reached 200 micrograms per cubic meter – air quality standards in the United States for such particulates are 12 micrograms per cubic meter. The Air Quality Index was regularly in the range marked "Very Unhealthy" or "Hazardous" (the worst possible ranking) in cities across the west coast. By the end of September when fires had calmed, one could still see the effects on air quality as far as Massachusetts. A longer wildfire season means more overlap with flu season, and thus a likely increase in flu hospitalizations across the country if flu vaccine effectiveness or take-up do not increase. What this Means: An extensive literature has shown that improving air quality carries a multitude of benefits. Our results suggest reduced hospitalizations from the flu is yet another. The results also imply that seemingly disparate policy actions of pollution control and expanded flu vaccination provide greater returns to public health than found when studied in isolation. We can improve outcomes through more prolific and effective vaccines, better air quality, or both. Since we cannot fully control the vaccine/influenza match in any given year, investing in air quality controls can help hedge against bad vaccine matches. And since we cannot predict wildfire outbreaks and the shocks they bring to pollution, investing in a robust vaccine infrastructure and widespread take-up can hedge against poor air quality shocks. If getting the flu shot protects us against some of the dangers of air pollution, it gives policymakers one more reason to encourage vaccine take-up in polluted areas, and one more reason for people to go out and get vaccinated. With our healthcare system already under stress due to COVID-19, anything that can reduce additional hospitalizations has high returns.

View: Text | PDF Clinical Medicine Immunology Vaccines A replication-competent adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine induces durable systemic and mucosal immunity Text PDF Abstract BACKGROUND To understand the features of a replicating vaccine that might drive potent and durable immune responses to transgene-encoded antigens, we tested a replication-competent adenovirus type 4 encoding influenza virus H5 HA (Ad4-H5-Vtn) administered as an oral capsule or via tonsillar swab or nasal spray.METHODS Viral shedding from the nose, mouth, and rectum was measured by PCR and culturing. H5-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were measured by bead array binding assays. Serum antibodies were measured by a pseudovirus entry inhibition, microneutralization, and HA inhibition assays.RESULTS Ad4-H5-Vtn DNA was shed from most upper respiratory tract–immunized (URT-immunized) volunteers for 2 to 4 weeks, but cultured from only 60% of participants, with a median duration of 1 day. Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccination induced increases in H5-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood as well as increases in IgG and IgA in nasal, cervical, and rectal secretions. URT immunizations induced high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against H5 that remained stable out to week 26. The duration of viral shedding correlated with the magnitude of the NAb response at week 26. Adverse events (AEs) were mild, and peak NAb titers were associated with overall AE frequency and duration. Serum NAb titers could be boosted to very high levels 2 to 5 years after Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccination with recombinant H5 or inactivated split H5N1 vaccine.CONCLUSION Replicating Ad4 delivered to the URT caused prolonged exposure to antigen, drove durable systemic and mucosal immunity, and proved to be a promising platform for the induction of immunity against viral surface glycoprotein targets.TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01443936 and NCT01806909.FUNDING Intramural and Extramural Research Programs of the NIAID, NIH (U19 AI109946) and the Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS), NIAID, NIH (contract HHSN272201400008C).

Vassilieva1*Song Li2Heorhiy Korniychuk1Dahnide M. Taylor1Shelly Wang1Mark R. Prausnitz2Richard W. Compans11Department of Microbiology & Immunology and Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States2School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United StatesCurrent strategies for improving protective response to influenza vaccines during immunosenescence do not adequately protect individuals over 65 years of age. Here, we used an aged mouse model to investigate the potential of co-delivery of influenza vaccine with the recently identified combination of a saponin adjuvant Quil-A and an activator of the STING pathway, 2’3 cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) via dissolving microneedle patches (MNPs) applied to skin. We demonstrate that synergy between the two adjuvant components is observed after their incorporation with H1N1 vaccine into MNPs as revealed by analysis of the immune responses in adult mice. Aged 21-month-old mice were found to be completely protected against live influenza challenge after vaccination with the MNPs adjuvanted with the Quil-A/cGAMP combination (5 µg each) and demonstrated significantly reduced morbidity compared to the observed responses in these mice vaccinated with unadjuvanted MNPs. Analysis of the lung lysates of the surviving aged mice post challenge revealed the lowest level of residual inflammation in the adjuvanted groups. We conclude that combining influenza vaccine with a STING pathway activator and saponin-based adjuvant in MNPs is a novel option for skin vaccination of the immunosenescent population, which is at high risk for influenza.IntroductionThe Global Influenza Mortality project estimated on average 389,000 influenza-associated respiratory deaths annually, of which 67% were among people 65 years and older (1). In the United States, the yearly vaccination rate of the population over 65 years old is estimated to be between 60% and 70%; however nearly 90% of influenza-related deaths occur in this age group (2). These numbers clearly demonstrate an inadequate protective immunity elicited by current influenza vaccines in immunosenescent individuals, and underscore the importance of research aimed at improving vaccines specifically designed for aged individuals. Recently, using an aged mouse model, we demonstrated that a novel combination adjuvant consisting of saponin Quil-A and a STING pathway activator cGAMP is more effective than the current methods in improving the reduced immune response in immunosenescence (3). In the present study we investigate the potential of delivering this adjuvanted formulation to the skin by means of dissolving microneedle patches (MNPs) (4).Skin vaccination against influenza using MNPs (5, 6) has advanced to the stage of clinical trials (7–9). The MNPs used in this study are skin patches that contain an array of 100 solid, conical microneedles measuring hundreds of microns in length, and are made of water-soluble materials that encapsulate the vaccine and adjuvant(s). Upon application to skin, the microneedles painlessly penetrate the skin’s upper layers where they dissolve within minutes, thereby delivering the vaccine and candidate adjuvant(s). By targeting the skin, vaccination by MNPs has been shown to have a number of immunological advantages in comparison to traditional intramuscular administration in adult and young mouse models including dose sparing, stronger humoral and cellular immune responses, greater duration of immunity and broader cross-protection against heterologous virus strains (10–17). In addition, MNPs as a delivery system are generally preferred by patients (18–20) including older people (21). We have previously reported that MNP vaccination decreased the age—dependent decline of the functional antibodies compared to intramuscular injection. However, the “physical adjuvancy” effect produced by the mechanical placement of MNPs into the skin was diminished in the middle-aged and especially aged animals in which the antibody response was similar after MNP and IM vaccination (22). Thus, similar to systemic formulations MNPs need to be adjuvanted for successful use in the aged. Thermostability, an absence of sharps waste, as well as the possibility of self-administration represent some logistical advantages of MNPs. The adjuvanted MNPs are attractive as a way to avoid systemic reactogenicity often associated with the administration of adjuvants.An agonist of the intracellular stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, cGAMP, has been proposed as a skin adjuvant (23). Until recently it was unclear how efficiently charged dinucleotides such as cGAMP traverse the cell membrane to interact with intracellular STING, but a folate-organic phosphate antiporter SLC19A1 has now been identified as the major transporter of cyclic di-nucleotides in humans (24). We proposed that availability of charged compound cGAMP for an intracellular STING adaptor is increased by the addition of the membrane-active saponin to the vaccine formulation (3). In the present study, we co-incorporated cGAMP, the saponin adjuvant Quil-A, and a subunit influenza vaccine into dissolving MNPs, and assessed their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in live virus challenge experiments in the mouse model.Materials and MethodsEthics StatementAll institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed in accordance with and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at Emory University and Georgia Institute of Technology.AnimalsBALB/cAnNCrl female mice (Charles River Labs, Wilmington, MA) were housed in microisolators with filter tops in a biocontainment level BSL-1 animal facility and subjected to a 12/12-h light/dark cycle and temperature between 20 and 22◦C. Mice were moved to a BSL-2 facility operating under the same light and temperature conditions for challenge study. Young adult mice were 10 weeks old and aged mice were 21 months old by the time of immunization. Mice were randomly assigned to the groups and no animals were excluded from the study. Blinding was not possible due to small number of investigators.VirusesH1N1 influenza A/California/07/09 virus obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, GA), and H1N1 influenza A/Christchurch/16/10 virus NIB74 obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC, Potters Bar, UK) were expanded and titrated in MDCK cells (ATCC CCL 34 Manassas, VA) (22). Mouse-adapted A/California/07/09 H1N1 virus (25) was used in challenge experiments. The LD50 dose was determined in adult female BALB/c mice using the Reed-Muench calculation method (26).VaccinesInfluenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent A/California/07/09 H1N1 vaccine from BEI resources (NR-20347, Manassas, VA) and A/Christchurch/16/2010 NIB-74 (H1N1) vaccine monobulk generously provided by Seqirus (formerly NVS Influenza Vaccines, Cambridge, MA) were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultracel 30,000 MWCO spin filters and supplemented with 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. A/Christchurch H1N1/16/10 was concentrated 11 x from 0.359 mg/ml HA to 4 mg/ml HA and A/California 07/09 H1N1 was concentrated 12–19 x from 0.03 mg/ml HA to 0.368 mg/ml HA or 0.574 mg/ml HA, respectively, and the stocks were combined and HA content was determined by SRID assay as previously described (27, 28) using strain-specific reagents from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (Kensington, MD). These vaccines are pandemic-type 2009 strains protective against challenge with A/California/07/09 H1N1 virus.AdjuvantsQuil-A and 2’3’-cGAMP (cyclic [G(2’,5’)pA(3’,5’)p]), were purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA). The stock solutions of adjuvants were prepared in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.MNP Fabrication and Vaccine Delivery EfficiencyDissolving MNPs were made in a two-step micromolding method as previously described (22). Adjuvanted or unadjuvanted MNPs had different formulations only in the first step. Briefly, a vaccine-loaded solution was casted on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molds under vacuum. This casting solution consisted of vaccine (0.38 mg/ml A/Christchurch/16/10, or 0.29 mg/ml A/California/07/09), 1% w/v polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and 10% w/v sucrose. When making adjuvanted MNPs, this solution contained additionally 0.48 mg/ml Quil-A and/or 0.34–3.4 mg/ml cGAMP for A/Christchurch MNPs, or 1.4 mg/ml Quil-A and/or 0.7–1.4 mg/ml cGAMP for A/California MNPs. The first step took 30 min under vacuum. In the second step, a polymer solution consisting of 18% w/w PVA and 18% w/w sucrose was cast on the mold to form the backing layer of MNPs. The filled molds were kept under vacuum for 3 h and on a 40°C hot plate overnight to completely dry the MNPs. Each MNP consisted of a 10 × 10 array of MNs within a square with around 7 mm sides (i.e., ~0.5 cm2). Each conical MN base diameter ≈ 200 µm, height ≈ 600 µm) was mounted atop an expanding pedestal (base diameter ≈ 600 µm, height ≈ 400 µm) (Supplemental Figure 1). All MNPs were stored with desiccant in individual sealed pouches until use. Vaccine content in the unadjuvanted MNPs was measured by ELISA using anti-HA A/California/07/09 antibodies (H1-Ab-1304 from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (Kensington, MD) and SRID-measured vaccine stock as a standard, as previously described (22). When both saponin and cGAMP were present, the amount of the vaccine measured in MNPs was significantly lower than the unadjuvanted samples (Supplemental Figure 2) indicating that these adjuvants interfered with the quantification. Since all MNPs were prepared with the same volume of vaccines in one batch fabrication the amounts of Quil-A and cGAMP was calculated from the added stocks. Vaccine delivery efficiency determined by comparing vaccine content in unused vs. used unadjuvanted MNP was 70 ± 19% (mean ± SD, n=6) for A/Christchurch/16/2010-loaded MNPs used to vaccinate mature adult mice and 63 ± 12% for A/California07/09-loaded MNPs used to vaccinate the aged mice (Supplemental Figure 1).Vaccination ProtocolMice were immunized once either intramuscularly (IM) in the upper quadrant of the hind leg or via MNPs applied to the depilated dorsal skin as described previously (27). The patches were applied to the skin of anesthetized mice using manual pressure for 1 minute and left on skin for total 20 minutes. The delivered vaccine dose was 1.3 ± 0.4 µg hemagglutinin (HA; mean, s.d., n=6) for A/ Christchurch/16/10 (H1N1) MNPs and 0.9 ± 0.2 µg HA (mean, s.d., n=11) for A/California/07/09 (H1N1) MNPs. IM vaccination with A/ Christchurch/16/10 (H1N1) vaccine was performed by intramuscular injection of 1.2 µg of vaccine antigen in a total volume of 0.05 ml.Challenge StudyMice were challenged with mouse-adapted A/Ca07/09 (H1N1) virus (25) by intranasal installation of 30 µl of the virus stock under brief isoflurane anesthesia and monitored for the signs of infection as previously described (27) at 7 (young adult mice) or 6 (aged mice) weeks after single vaccination. The humane endpoint used for euthanasia was 25% loss of the initial body weight.Cytokine Assay in the LungsLungs were collected from the aged mice that survived viral challenge and pushed through 40 µm cell strainers (VWR, Radnor, PA) in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 media (Mediatech, Manassas, VA). Lung lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 min and cytokines were measured using Bio-Plex Pro mouse cytokine group 1 23-plex panel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cytokine concentrations were normalized per total protein measured using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (Thermo, Massachusetts, USA).Quantification of Humoral ResponseBlood samples were collected by submandibular bleeding and analyzed as described previously (22). Briefly, vaccine-specific antibody isotypes were determined by ELISA using Nunc MaxiSorp 96-well plates (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) coated with 100 ng HA of the same vaccine as used for immunization. Isotype standards and detection antibodies were from Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL (capture goat anti-mouse antibodies #1010-01, isotype standards IgG # 010701, IgG1 #0102-01, IgG2a #0103-01, IgM #0101-01; HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies anti-IgG, #1030-05, anti-IgG1 #1070-05, anti-IgG2a #1080-05, anti-IgM #1020-05). Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers were assessed based on the WHO protocol (29) using turkey red blood cells (Lampire biological laboratories, Pipersville, PA). The samples below the lowest level of detection (HAI = 10) were assigned a titer of 5 for calculations.StatisticsThe statistical significance was calculated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s posttest using GraphPad Prism 8 software and p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. HAI titers were converted to log2 for statistical analysis. We used software Statistica 7.0 (StatSoft, USA) to calculate the required sample size per group for α=0.05 and power goal 0.8 based on the parameters of immune response from our previous study (3). For adult mice we used means and SD of HAI titers at day 28 postvaccination for 1-way 7-group (1 non-adjuvanted and 6 adjuvanted) ANOVA analysis and for the aged mice we used means and SD of vaccine-specific IgG levels at day 28 postvaccination for 1-way 4-group (1 non-adjuvanted and 3 adjuvanted) ANOVA. The sample size of 4 for the adult mice and 7 for the aged mice was sufficient to observe significant differences in these parameters.ResultsAdjuvant Effect of cGAMP/Quil-A Combination Is Preserved in MNP-Vaccinated Young Adult 10-Week-Old MiceWe prepared MNPs by mixing concentrated A/Christchurch H1N1/16/10 (H1N1) vaccine with adjuvant stocks followed by micromold fabrication as described in the Materials and Methods section. Groups of 10-week-old BALB/c mice were vaccinated with MNPs that delivered 1.3 µg of an HA vaccine alone or in combination with low (1.2 µg) or high (12 µg) doses of cGAMP or with 1.7 µg Quil-A. A control group that received intramuscular (IM) injection of unadjuvanted vaccine (1.2 µg of HA) did not develop HAI titers, but most mice in the group that received unadjuvanted vaccine via MNPs developed HAI titers at or above the detection level of 10 by week 2 postvaccination which further increased to a geometric mean HAI titer (GMT HAI) of 24 by day 28 postvaccination (Figure 1A and Supplemental Table 2). Thus, in adult mice MNP delivery significantly improved antibody response to unadjuvanted vaccine, which was much greater than after vaccination by IM injection (GMT HAI 5 vs. 24, respectively, p = 0.0035 at day 28 postvaccination). Use of MNPs that contained vaccine and 1.7 µg of Quil-A as adjuvant did not change the dynamics of HAI titers compared to unadjuvanted MNPs (Figure 1A). cGAMP-loaded MNPs elicited HAI titers as soon as at day 7 postvaccination. However, in the absence of Quil-A, the low and the high doses of cGAMP elicited similar HAI titers (Figure 1B), potentially indicating a hindrance for the access of cGAMP to its intracellular receptor in the immunocompetent cells. Remarkably, the response to cGAMP was found to be dose-dependent upon addition of Quil-A. In the low dose cGAMP/Quil-A MNP group the titers did not differ from an unadjuvanted vaccine, but in the high dose cGAMP/Quil-A MNP group they were significantly higher than in the unadjuvanted MNP group at days 7 and 28 postvaccination (Figure 1C). A single application of MNPs containing 12 µg cGAMP + 1.7 µg Quil-A yielded the highest HAI GMT of 105.6, which was 4-fold higher by day 28 than that observed in the unadjuvanted MNP group (p = 0.008). The titers in Quil-A -supplemented high-dose cGAMP group demonstrated higher trend compared to the high-dose cGAMP only group (GMT HAI was 30.3 vs. 10, p = 0.057, at day 14 and 105.5 vs. 34.8, p = 0.14, at day 28 postvaccination, respectively). Thus the analysis of the dynamics of HAI titers revealed that in the adult mice, each adjuvant by itself induced lower HAI titers than in a combination. Levels of vaccine-specific immunoglobulins were the lowest in the systemically vaccinated mice and the highest in the combination MNP group. In the absence of Quil-A they were similar in the low and the high-dose cGAMP groups while addition of Quil-A significantly increased the level of total antibodies, especially IgG2a isotype (Supplemental Figure 3).FIGURE 1 Figure 1 Effect of MNP vaccination in young adult 10-week-old mice (n=5 in all groups except the unadjuvanted MNP group, where n = 7). Mice were immunized once with A/Christchurch H1N1/16/10 (H1N1) vaccine alone or in combination with adjuvants by the IM route (1.2 µg HA, group V, IM) or through skin with MNP (1.3 ± 0.4 µg HA, all other groups). HAI titers were measured against A/Christchurch H1N1/16/10 (H1N1) virus. (A) HAI titers in mice immunized with unadjuvanted vaccine either IM or by MNPs or with MNPs which co-incorporated 1.2 µg of Quil-A with the vaccine; (B) HAI titers in mice MNP-vaccinated with either unadjuvanted vaccine or with vaccine combined with high (12 µg) or low (1.2 µg) doses of cGAMP; (C) HAI titers in mice MNP-vaccinated with either unadjuvanted vaccine or adjuvanted with a combination of cGAMP and Quil-A.

All mice were immunized with MNPs except for one group vaccinated with the unadjuvanted vaccine intramuscularly (V, IM). (E) Changes in body weight of vaccinated mice after challenge. Note that all unvaccinated mice succumbed to infection while all MNP-vaccinated mice survived. In the inadjuvanted IM group one mouse reached 25 % weight loss threshold at day 6 post challenge and was humanely euthanized.Mice were challenged with A/California07/09 H1N1 virus 1.5 months after single immunization. All non-vaccinated animals and one out of five mice vaccinated by the IM delivery route succumbed to infection (Figure 1D), while all groups of MNPs-vaccinated mice were completely protected. At day 6 postchallenge the animals in the IM group demonstrated the largest 18% drop in body weight and all MNP vaccinated animals exhibited a lower ~ 2%–5% weight drop (Figure 1E) confirming our previous findings of improved immunogenicity of MNP-delivered vaccine as compared to IM injection (25, 27). Altogether, the data obtained with young adult mice indicate that cGAMP and Quil-A were successfully incorporated into MNPs to generate strong immune responses to the HA antigen, which is consistent with previous works in which each adjuvant retained activity when used in MNP format (30, 31).Effect of Immunization of Aged Mice With Quil-A Alone-Adjuvanted or cGAMP/Quil-A-Adjuvanted Vaccine Using MNPsNext, we tested whether cGAMP/Quil-A-adjuvanted MNPs will enhance protective immunity in aged mice. We immunized groups of 21-month-old mice with MNPs formulated with 0.9 µg A/California/07/09 (H1N1) vaccine alone or with 5 µg Quil-A as adjuvant alone, or in combination with 2.5 or 5 µg cGAMP and challenged them with 16 plaque forming units (pfu) of the homologous H1N1 virus 6 weeks after single immunization. We did not include a vaccine/cGAMP group because we previously demonstrated that cGAMP in 5 µg dose without addition of Quil-A did not improve survival of immunized aged mice compared to the unadjuvanted vaccine (3).In the naïve group, three out of six (50%) mice survived the challenge. In the unadjuvanted group, six out of seven mice survived (Figure 2A) but exhibited a maximal average weight loss of 16% on day 8 postinfection (Figure 2B), indicating modest improvement in protective efficacy in the absence of adjuvant(s). Similar survival was observed in the groups that received Quil-A (5 µg) or Quil-A (5 µg)/cGAMP (2.5 µg)—adjuvanted MNPs, but the average weight loss was not significantly different from the unadjuvanted group (Figures 2A, B). Remarkably, the Quil-A/cGAMP combination group (5 µg each) was completely protected from mortality (Figure 2A) and demonstrated decreased morbidity as evidenced by only 3% maximal weight loss, that was 13% lower than in the non-adjuvanted group (p = 0.0125) (Figures 2A, B). Analysis of the immune responses to vaccination revealed that low HAI titers, characteristic of the aged mice (32, 33), did not correlate with protection (Figure 2A and Supplemental Table 2) or significantly differ between groups (Figure 3A). Compared to the nonadjuvanted MNPs, all adjuvanted MNPs demonstrated a trend of approximately 4-fold higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratio at day 7 postvaccination (Figure 3B), possibly indicating more efficient induction of a Th-1 based response in these groups. The ratio dropped from day 7 to days 14 and 28 but remained higher in the adjuvanted groups. It was 14 fold higher in Quil-A (5 µg)/cGAMP (2.5 µg) group by day 14 (p=0.003) and 5 fold higher in 5 µg Quil-A group by day 28 (p=0.033) compared to the non-adjuvanted MNP group. Quil-A (5 µg) and Quil-A /cGAMP (5 µg each) improved the isotype switch, as was indicated by ~3-fold higher IgG/IgM ratio by day 28 postvaccination (Figure 3C). The total levels of vaccine-specific IgG and its isotypes were higher in the adjuvanted groups vs. a non-adjuvanted group, with statistically significant differences in groups adjuvanted with 5 µg Quil-A alone and 5 µg Quil-A/2.5 µg cGAMP—combination (Figures 3D–F). Overall, the analysis of humoral immune responses revealed increased antibody production and class switch in all adjuvanted MNP groups compared to the non-adjuvanted group.FIGURE 2 Figure 2 Effect of adjuvant composition of MNPs on protection of vaccinated aged mice against challenge. Aged 21-month-old animals received a single dose (0.9 ± 0.2 µg HA) of adjuvanted or non – adjuvanted A/California 07/09 H1N1 vaccine followed by challenge with 16 pfu of the mouse-adapted influenza A/California 07/09 H1N1virus 6 weeks postvaccination (n=7 in all groups except in the 5 µg Quil-A / 2.5 µg cGAMP group where one mouse expired, and in nonvaccinated group n = 6).

Stars indicate significance levels of the differences between adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted group at the same time postvaccination calculated by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s posttest (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).The surviving mice were sacrificed 2 weeks after challenge, and the lung lysates were analyzed for differences in the levels of cytokines and chemokines. Significant differences were observed in the levels of two interleukins: Il-4 was 2.2-fold lower in the 5 µg Quil-A/5 µg cGAMP combination group than in the unadjuvanted group (p = 0.0139) (Figure 4A), and compared to the naïve group Il-12 (p40) was 5-fold lower in 5/5 combination group (p = 0.0014) and ~3-fold lower in the Quil-A only (p = 0.0068) and 2.5/5 combination (p = 0.015) groups, with no significant differences between survivors in unadjuvanted and naïve groups (Figure 4B). The absence of significant changes in other tested cytokines (Figure 4) are most probably due to two factors: first, the lungs were analyzed at the resolving phase of infection in the surviving mice and second, the small number of survived naive animals, since 50% of them succumbed to infection. Nevertheless, there was a clear trend of the lowest levels of THFα, IFN-γ, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and KC in the cGAMP/Quil-A group, 5 ug each (red circles in Figure 4), in comparison to other MNP groups and the non-vaccinated group. We expected to observe markers of inflammation at the completion of challenge because it was previously reported that they lingered for longer time in the lungs of influenza-infected aged C57BL/6 mice compared to the young ones in which some inflammatory cytokines peaked at 6 days post-infection and then returned to baseline by day 12 as the infection was resolving but remained significantly higher on days 9 and 12 in aged 19–22-month-old mice (34). The reduced levels of these Th2 and Th1 cytokines in the lungs of recovered animals at the resolution of infection was consistent with the reduced morbidity estimated from the decrease in weight loss achieved with the adjuvanted MNPs, especially in the 5 µg Quil-A/5 µg cGAMP group. In summary, compared to the unadjuvanted MNP formulation, MNP delivery of the Quil-A/cGAMP (5 µg each)—adjuvanted vaccine not only completely protected aged mice from a physiologically relevant ~1xLD50 challenge dose but also reduced inflammation in the lungs postchallenge.FIGURE 4 Figure 4 Effect of adjuvant composition of MNPs on the levels of cytokines and chemokines in lung lysates of the aged mice that survived the challenge. The lungs from all vaccinated mice and one naive mouse were collected on day 13 postchallenge (circles), and from the remaining two naïve mice on day 16 postchallenge (triangles).

The statistical significance between groups was calculated by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s posttest.DiscussionThe aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of using cGAMP/Quil-A as a combination adjuvant with influenza vaccine in MNP format to enhance immune responses in aged mice. MNPs possess the unique property of “physical adjuvancy” which arises from the physical puncture of skin by microneedles during application of MNPs, which in turn induces limited (and painless) cell damage leading to inflammation at the site of application (35). Physical adjuvantation may also come from formulation of the MNPs using a water-soluble polymer that forms a gel upon contact with interstitial fluid in the skin. As the gel dissolves and the antigen and adjuvant(s) slowly diffuse away from the site of MNP application, the antigen and adjuvant(s) have a more extended presentation to the immune system, which can lead to improved immune responses (36). Other factors, such as the presence of skin-resident antigen-presenting cells, for example Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells, as well as lymphatics draining from the skin may also contribute to the efficacy of skin vaccination by MNPs (37, 38). As we confirmed in this work, simply changing the influenza vaccine delivery route from systemic vaccination to skin vaccination by MNPs increased vaccine efficacy in young adult mice (27). Experiments with the 10-week-old mice were performed to determine whether the adjuvant properties were preserved in MNPs. A direct comparison between adult and aged mice vaccinated with cGAMP/Quil-A combination was described previously (3) but it was not the goal of this current work. We did not include IM group in the aged mice study because we previously compared IM and MNP delivery methods and demonstrated that MNPs did not significantly improve vaccine immunogenicity in mice over 14 months old (22). Here we show that MNPs can be successfully used to co-incorporate a cGAMP/Quil-A adjuvant combination with influenza vaccine. This finding is consistent with published studies in which each adjuvant retained activity when used alone in MNP format (30, 31). We previously demonstrated that availability of cGAMP for an intracellular STING adaptor is increased by the addition of the membrane-active saponin to the vaccine formulation (3). The delivery of STING ligands inside cells can also be achieved using particle- and liposome-based delivery systems (39) many of which require special preparation procedures and are not compatible with microneedle format. A practical advantage of cGAMP/Quil-A combination is that it can be easily added to both liquid formulations and incorporated in the MNPs.Mice between 18–24 month of age roughly correspond to 56–69-year-old humans age-wise (40). In our previous study the animals were 19-month-old at vaccination and 20-month-old by the time of challenge and in the current study they were 21-month-old at vaccination and 22.5-month-old by challenge. Because of more advanced age the immune response postvaccination was expectedly lower in these animals, but they were completely protected from a low dose challenge after a single vaccination with MNPs adjuvanted with the same Quil-A/cGAMP combination (5 μg each). The amount of HA antigen in our experiments was chosen on the basis of our previous data. Previously, 1 μg of non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine was not protective against high challenge dose (300 pfu), yet the addition of the combination adjuvant increased protection to 100% (3). Here, we used a lower challenge dose of 16 pfu at which 86% of vaccinated aged mice survived but exhibited high weight loss which was prevented by using cGAMP/Quil-A—adjuvanted MNPs for skin vaccination. Use of low infection dose ~ 1xLD50 in this study better resembled the outcome of flu infection in humans and allowed us to analyze the residual inflammation in the lungs of surviving mice in unadjuvanted and adjuvanted groups. The low level of Th1 and Th2 cytokines IL-12 and Il-4 at the resolving phase of infection in the surviving mice vaccinated with adjuvant combination indicated a lower degree of inflammation, consistent with the lowest weight loss in this group at the peak of infection. The HAI titers detected in all groups of aged mice were low consistent with published data (32, 33) and did not correlate with protection. The total vaccine-specific antibodies were generally higher in most adjuvanted groups. The cGAMP/Quil-A group, 5 µg each, that demonstrated complete survival and the lowest weight loss after challenge also presented with reduced inflammation markers as compared to other MNP groups. In elderly humans, T-cell responses better correlate with protection than antibody titers (41). Similarly, our data indicate possible involvement of T-cell–mediated immunity (34) stimulated by cGAMP/Quil-A combination that we plan to address as a future direction of research. The main goal of this study was to determine if the previously identified combination of cGAMP and Quil-A, 5 μg each (vaccine/adjuvant ratio ~1:5:5, wt/wt) will remain effective in MNPs. We previously determined that a 5 μg dose of cGAMP did not improve the protective immunity in the aged mice but was protective when combined with Quil-A (3). Quil-A is a mixture of saponins and as such has inherent safety concerns. In the preliminary screening, we observed a small scab on the skin surface at the site of intradermal injections of vaccine formulated with 10 μg Quil-A. Thus, we kept the amount of Quil-A delivered with MNPs to 5 μg which is similar to 3 μg dose recently used to adjuvant tetravalent Demge sE in Nanopatch (42). The visual inspection of the MNP application sites did not reveal skin irritation or scabs. QS-21 is a fractions Quil-A with lower toxicity (43) and potent adjuvancy (44). Nanopatch adjuvanted with 1.5 μg dose of OS-21 was effective in adult mice; increasing the dose up to 6 ug led to decrease of flu-specific antibodies (45). Further dose response studies involving QS-21 and other saponin compounds (46–49) as well as new and potent STING activators will define the optimal ratio between the active pharmaceutical ingredients to best balance between adjuvant activity and possible reactogenicity. Another important question to be answered in future research is breadth of immunity in aged animals vaccinated with adjuvanted MNPs by using heterologous challenge strains.It is important for the skin vaccination format that human keratinocytes respond to cGAMP treatment (50). STING pathway activators are also effective as mucosal adjuvants, but mucosal delivery may potentially promote allergic asthma as was recently demonstrated in mice (51). Delivering STING agonists through the skin via MNPs may be a better approach: metal MNPs coated with such agonists were shown to elicit lower levels of antigen-specific IgE than when coated with Alum adjuvant (30). In a previous report (3) we demonstrated a combined effect of cGAMP and saponin in the aged but not in young mice. Although there is no clear explanation of this effect, a recent study demonstrated that tumor immune checkpoint blockade therapy was not effective in the aged mice without intratumoral stimulation of STING, but in younger mice the therapy itself was effective and STING activation did not increase the efficiency further (52).The adjuvanted MNPs used in this study can be considered to represent a skin vaccine delivery system that combines physical adjuvantation with two chemical adjuvants. Given the immunological and logistical advantages of MNPs, they hold great promise as a modern vaccine delivery platform (6, 53, 54). For example, dissolving microneedles were employed to deliver a novel vaccine against COVID-19 coronavirus (55). Older people are receptive to using MNPs as a delivery technology (21) and our findings open a new vaccination option specific for the aged population at high risk for influenza. To our knowledge this is the first report that demonstrates the successful incorporation of a novel and effective cGAMP/Quil-A combination adjuvant into dissolving microneedle patches. This formulation improves protective efficacy of an influenza vaccine in aged mice. This is a significant result which indicates that the vaccination outcome in the elderly can be improved by the immune activating effects of this combination of adjuvants delivered together with licensed HA-based influenza vaccine via skin microneedle patches using a single vaccination approach which is consistent with the seasonal flu vaccination recommendations.Data Availability StatementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material.

During the most recent 5th epidemic wave in 2016/17 two distinct lineages with increased human infections and wider geographical spread emerged. In preparation for any future adaptations, broadly reactive antibodies against H7N9 are required for surveillance, therapy and prophylaxis. In this study we have isolated a panel of nanobodies (Nbs) with broad reactivity across H7 influenza strains, including H7N9 strains between 2013 and 2017. We also describe Nbs capable of distinguishing between the most recent high and low pathogenicity Yangtze River Delta lineage H7N9 strains. Nanobodies were classified into 5 distinct groups based on their epitope footprint determined using yeast display and mutational scanning. The epitope footprint of Nbs capable of distinguishing high pathogenic (HP) A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 from low pathogenic (LP) A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (H7N9) were correlated to natural sequence divergence in the head domain at lysine 164. Several Nbs binding to the head domain were capable of viral neutralisation. The potency of one nanobody NB7-14 could be increased over 1000-fold to 113 pM by linking two Nbs together. Nbs specific for distinct epitopes on H7N9 may be useful for surveillance or therapy in human or veterinary settings.

In the last century, four pandemics have led to many human deaths caused by three subtypes, H1N1 in 1918 and 2009, H2N2 in 1957 and H3N2 in 19682, 3. In more recent years a number of avian influenza viruses, for example, H5N1 and H7N9, have crossed into the human population, but fortunately these zoonotic outbreaks have not yet become pandemics due to their low human-to-human transmissibility4. However, a more recent outbreak of H7N9 in China in 2016–2017 resulted in substantial geographical spread with the emergence of H7N9 strains carrying a polybasic cleavage site which can facilitate systemic spread beyond the lungs5, 6. As such, H7N9 may be considered a serious pandemic threat and there is a pressing need to prepare for robust global responses which can be rapidly implemented should this virus ever become highly transmissible within the human population. Vaccines remain the main prophylactic treatment option and in March 2017 the WHO recommended new candidate vaccine viruses be made from the Yangtze River Delta lineage of the low pathogenic A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (H7N9) [(LP)HK/2017(H7N9)] and the high pathogenic A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (H7N9) [(HP)GD/2016(H7N9)] viruses, which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials7, 8.Although vaccines remain the mainstay of infection control for influenza, their timely implementation, poor immunogenicity in certain patient groups and limited worldwide production capacity remain a considerable technical challenge. Anti-viral drugs are available although resistant viral strains are emerging9. Passive transfer of serum from convalescent patients is an option which was deployed, with some success, in the 1918 pandemic10 and more recently to treat a severely ill H5N1 patient11. However, this approach cannot be implemented on a global scale due to limited supply, high risk of toxicity, uncertain dosing, and difficulties in administration. A more promising approach is passive immunotherapy with recombinant monoclonal antibodies with broad reactivity against H7N9 which can be manufactured with consistent quality, stockpiled, and delivered immediately in a pandemic emergency12,13,14.As a typical member of the IAV family, H7N9 is classified through the major viral envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is a homo-trimeric molecule with each monomer consisting of two chains, HA1 and HA2 which fold into a structure comprising a highly variable globular head and a more conserved proximal stem domain15. HA mediates virus entry into host cells through the receptor binding site on the globular head interacting with sialic acid receptors on the cell surface. This in turn leads to virus internalisation, and then membrane fusion mediated by the HA stem region15. The pre-dominant host immune response is directed against the HA16 and this selective pressure drives the continuous antigenic changes in HA17. The high mutation rate and transmissibility means the discovery of new therapeutics is an active area of research14 and a number of broad spectrum human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for H7N9 have been described including CT14918, H7.16719, M82620, HNIgGD521 HNIgGA622 L4A-1423 and P52EO324. These monoclonal antibodies have been identified from human donors after either natural IAV infection or H7 subunit vaccination7, 19 and unusually have limited somatic hypermutation. This suggests that they are the result of an early and immediate response to H7N9, likely biased by previous immune history of exposure to influenza19, 23. In addition, recent reports have suggested that an effective protective immune response to H7N9 infection is extremely rare in humans23. Alternative approaches to generating mAbs to H7N9 which have been extensively optimised, could be expected to yield molecules of higher affinity and to potentially different epitopes to those targeted by the human immune system.Although HA is continually changing, there are certain parts of the HA that are highly conserved, principally because they are essential for the infection process. Two functionally conserved sites lie within the receptor binding site and the HA stem which are required for viral uptake and membrane fusion, respectively15. Several cross-reactive human antibodies have been isolated against the highly conserved HA stem25, 26 or the receptor binding site of the head domain27. In several cases the route to cross-reactivity is achieved through using only their heavy chain for binding or through using a smaller binding footprint25,26,27. Conceptually a much smaller antibody epitope footprint may give a variable HA antigen less opportunities to escape binding and in effect there will need to be a mutational ‘bullseye’ for the virus to evade binding. Guided by these observations we have used nanobodies (Nbs) from alpacas as a potential route to cross-reactive antibodies28,29,30 as they are naturally devoid of a paired light chain and have a propensity to bind small pockets on protein surfaces31. In addition, given that camelid species are not thought to represent a zoonotic reservoir for influenza A, they may not be subject to the same immune constraints as human donors with prior exposure to IAV32. The unique properties of Nbs which also include small size, simple engineering into multi-domain antibodies and high stability are being exploited for a wide range of applications in biotechnology including diagnostics and immunotherapy31, 33, with the first nanobody, Caplicizumab, having been approved for the treatment of a blood clotting disorder in August 201834.In this study we have isolated Nbs with both cross-reactive and strain specific binding to the prototype low pathogenicity (LP) and high pathogenicity (HP) A(H7N9) strains which have emerged in the most recent 5th epidemic wave. We correlate their specificity and functional activity with their epitopes which have been mapped using yeast display and mutational scanning. This technique allows high throughput epitope mapping and identifies mutations that directly interfere with antibody binding. Their potential as tools for surveillance or emergency therapeutics in both human and veterinary applications is discussed.ResultsIsolation and characterisation of nanobodies specific for H7 hemagglutinin (HA)A juvenile male alpaca was immunised with purified recombinant H7-HA (Fig. 1a) from the human H7 strain A(H7N7) HA (A/Netherlands/219/2003) and an antigen specific serological immune response was seen in both ELISA and viral micro-neutralisation assays (Fig. 1b,c). After a third booster injection a phage displayed nanobody library of 9.6 × 107 was constructed using purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Two phage display library selection strategies were used, (i) sequential rounds of selection on the same antigen to yield all Nbs specific for H7-HA (H7N9 or H7N7) or (ii) alternating selections between H7-HA and H3-HA to bias towards cross-subtype reactive Nbs. Primary screening involved picking random clones and testing for binding to recombinant HA and whole virus inactivated antigen reagents of subtypes H3 and H7 sub-types as non-purified Nbs. Clones that were positive in ELISA were then sequenced and grouped into clonally related families based on their VHH-CDR3 sequences (Table 1). Nbs with homologous VHH-CDR3 sequences of identical length were taken as belonging to the same clonal family and predicted to recognise the same or closely related epitopes. Several families of nanobodies containing homologous VHH-CDR3 sequences were identified which were likely derived from the same B cell lineage (Table 1). Nbs were purified and screened in ELISA on a panel of whole virus H7 antigen preparations to assess the breadth of cross-reactivity across both avian and human H7 strains from 2000 up to the most recent 5th epidemic wave of H7N9 in 2016–17. Most Nbs were capable of homo-subtypic cross-reactivity against influenza H7 strains, including H7N9 strains from 2013 to 2017 such as (HP) A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (H7N9) [(HP)GD/2016] and (LP) A/Hong Kong/125/2016 (H7N9) [(LP)HK/2017] Yangtze River Delta Lineage strains. We also identified a subgroup of Nbs (NB7-03, NB7-10 and NB7-13) which had lost binding to the most recent (HP)GD/2016 H7N9 strain. Nanobodies NB37X-01 – 04 were a distinct group with hetero-subtypic cross-reactive binding which extended to include the group 2 strain A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2).Figure 1Isolation of H7-HA specific nanobodies.

(c) Serological neutralising immune response in immunised alpacas using micro-neutralisation assays of A/Anhui/01/2013 (H7N9) NIBRG-268. A positive control sheep serum specific for the reverse genetics virus was used as a positive control.Full size imageTable 1 Nanobody sequence, specificity and neutralisation activity.Full size tableWe used yeast display to identify further hetero-subtypic H3/H7 cross-reactive Nbs that may have been missed using conventional phage display library screening. This technology has advantages over phage display as highly controlled selection strategies are possible where each individual yeast cell can be quantitatively selected for multiple parameters using flow cytometric cell sorting28, 35, 36. The VHH genes from the immunised alpaca were cloned into a yeast display vector (Fig. 1a) and the resulting library sorted for H7-HA binding and then subsequently with H3-HA (Fig. S1). By co-labelling with an anti-SV5 epitope tag, antibody antigen binding could be normalised to display level. Cross-reactive Nbs were predicted to bind to more conserved epitopes in the HA stem region28, so we performed a third round of ‘negative’ sorting using purified recombinant HA1 head domain, selecting cells displaying Nbs that do not bind the head domain (Fig. S1). Sequence analysis of randomly picked yeast clones from this epitope guided yeast library selection strategy gave exclusively H3/H7 cross-reactive nanobodies demonstrating the precision possible using cell sorting of yeast displayed libraries. In addition, two new Nbs (NB37X-05 and NB37X-06) with unique CDR3 sequence were identified which were not recovered using phage display.The final panel of 22 Nbs was then screened for neutralisation activity using pseudotyped viruses displaying the HA of A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) (Table 1). Several Nbs were neutralising with the most potent group being NB7-01, NB7-09, NB7-11 and NB7-14 which all belonged to the same clonal lineage with homologous VHH-CDR3 sequences of identical length. One of the advantages of Nbs over conventional mAbs is that they can be easily reformatted into multi-domain antibodies as all antigen binding activity is confined to a single domain. Linking Nbs together has been shown to significantly increase their potency through avidity29, 37 and we investigated whether similar increases in potency were possible with the lead nanobody NB7-14. Bivalent versions of NB7-14 were produced by fusing two identical binding domains separated by a thirty amino acid glycine linker and saw an increase in potency of more than 3 orders of magnitude to an IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of 113 pM (Fig. 2). Previous studies have shown that a bivalent nanobody specific for the head domain of H5N1 had substantially increased potency compared to the monovalent counterpart in both in vitro neutralisation assays and a mouse challenge model38. Our findings agree with these studies and suggest bivalent NB7-14 has improved potency through enhanced avidity and cross-linking of HA through either inter- or intra- molecular interactions.Figure 2Comparison of neutralisation of H7N9 by monovalent and bivalent NB7-14. Pseudotype micro-neutralisation assay performed using influenza A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7) HA bearing pseudovirus and mono- and bivalent nanobody NB7-14. Percentage neutralisation is plotted against molar concentration of NB7-14 in two different formats (nM). IC50 for monovalent NB7-14 (17 nM) and for bivalent NB7-14 (130 pM). Neutralisation of A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) was negative (data not shown).Full size imageEpitope mapping of H7-HA specific nanobodiesTo group Nbs as either head or stem specific we evaluated binding to purified recombinant HA1 head domain and full length HA0 protein using surface plasmon resonance and single cycle kinetics39. H7-specific Nbs (NB7-01 to 17) showed high affinity binding to both the HA1 domain and full length HA0 (Table 2) indicating that their epitopes lie in the globular head domain. Several Nbs had affinities less than 1 nM as a monovalent binding affinity constant (Fig. S2) and binding affinity was retained across all H7 strains tested including the most recent A/HongKong/125/2017 (H7N9). The hetero-subtypic cross-reactive nanobodies NB37X-01 to 06 did not show any binding to the head domain, however, they showed some degree of binding to full length HA0, but the data could not be fitted using a 1:1 model. This suggests that this group of H3/H7 cross-reactive nanobodies bind to epitopes outside of the head domain and likely to epitopes within the HA stem region.Table 2 Characterisation of nanobody binding affinity and head/stem specificity.Full size tableFor precise epitope localisation we used yeast surface display coupled with mutational scanning which we have described previously28. The HA0 precursor gene of hemagglutinin A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7) was sub-cloned into a yeast display vector in frame with an SV5 epitope tag. The use of a C-terminal epitope tag allows the detection and sorting of correctly folded HA displayed on the yeast surface independently of Nb binding using flow cytometry (Fig. S3). All Nbs showed binding to yeast cells displaying H7-HA0 suggesting that the epitopes could be located.Subsequently, a library of H7-HA0 mutants was generated by error-prone PCR using low-error rate mutagenesis. Initially the library was selected by incubating with NB7-14 and NB7-08 separately, and mutants which completely lost binding were recovered through two sequential rounds of ‘negative’ flow cytometric cell sorting. As allosteric mutations distant from the actual physical binding footprint could, in principal, lead to loss of binding, we performed a third round of ‘positive’ sorting with a non-competing antibody targeting the stem domain (Fig. 3a). This selection step focuses the recovery of mutations which lie within the physical epitope footprint of NB7-08 and NB7-14 and biases against HA mutations that may have an indirect effect on binding through structural disruption distant from the site of physical interaction. Following selection, random clones (n = 30) were picked, sequenced and aligned to wild-type HA0 to identify HA mutations which were enriched compared to the unselected library. These selectively enriched mutations were predicted to form part of the physical epitope footprint and were chosen for further testing. Clones with mutations introducingeplacing cysteine or proline residues were discarded as they were predicted to have indirect or pleiotropic effects on binding28. Only HA mutations which were shown to interfere with Nb binding without affecting HA display level were classified as epitope residues. Selection for loss of binding to NB7-08 identified mutations D67G, D67V, L70S and D246N located in the HA1 domain, (Fig. S4). D67 was mutated to both glycine and valine, reflecting its importance within the epitope of NB7-08. For NB7-14, HA-D67G was also selected, however HA-S135A mutation was also enriched (Fig. 3b,c) reflecting NB7-14 has a distinct but overlapping epitope footprint with NB7-08.Figure 3Epitope footprints of H7-HA specific nanobodies. (a) Example selection campaign for NB7-14 showing two rounds of ‘negative’ selection followed by a third round of ‘positive’ selection. (b) Flow cytometry histograms (FlowJo 10.4 software) showing Nb binding to yeast displayed wild-type H7-HA0 (A/Netherlands/219/2003) and binding of NB7-14, NB7-08, NB7-15, NB7-03, NB7-05 to yeast displayed HA carrying the mutations as indicated. (c) Binding activity to a panel of yeast displayed H7-HA0 mutants with residue numbering relative to HA1 domain. Each Nb is grouped by binding profile. Blue cells indicate the specific Nb used for HA library selections. Commercial H7-HA specific antibody MIA-H7-334 is included as positive control and retains binding to all mutants. Relative Nb binding to each yeast displayed HA mutant was calculated by dividing the MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) of Nb-mutant HA pair with the value for wild type H7-HA incubation and the resulting ratio normalised to percentage values. Binding was categorized as follows, ≤ 15% no binding (red), between 15 and 40% intermediate binding (orange) and ≥ 40% positive binding (green).Full size imageEach individual HA mutation was subsequently tested for binding to the complete panel of H7-HA specific Nbs (Fig. 3b,c) to allow grouping Nbs with overlapping epitopes. Although 11/16 Nbs lost binding due to a mutation at D67 and could be classed as broadly belonging to a single epitope group (Gp1) it was clear that epitope groups could be further de-lineated based on the individual mutations capable of disrupting binding.The remaining Nbs (NB7-03, NB7-05, NB7-10, NB7-13 and NB7-15) that were not affected by the D67 mutations required further HA library selections to identify their respective epitopes. In selections with NB7-15, two separate mutations at residue 71 (E71G and E71V) were selected and placed NB7-15 in a separate epitope group (Gp2). Selections with NB7-03 gave mutations E111V, R163G and K164E, again placing it in a further separate epitope group, Gp3 (Fig. 3b,c). Residue E111 was identified as particularly important as it was recovered multiple times mutated to different residues E111(G/D/K/R). Since binding of NB7-05 was not affected by any of the previously selected HA mutations, additional selections were done and R211S and R220S were shown to specifically disrupt its binding, placing it in epitope group 4 (Gp4) (Fig. 3b,c).All selected mutations were finally tested against the whole panel of Nbs which allowed the Nbs to be placed into 4 distinct epitope binding groups (Gp1, Gp2, Gp3, Gp4) with Gp 1 being divided into subgroups (Gp1a, Gp1b, Gp1c, Gp1d )(Fig. 3b,c) based on different combinations of mutations with D67. All mutations were mapped onto the structure of H7-HA and could be seen to be surface exposed residues, which suggests a direct involvement in Nb binding rather than a more general structural disruption (Fig. 5). Nbs belonging to the same epitope grouping in several cases had unique VHH CDR3 sequences reflecting their unique paratopes. This is an important consideration as, although they may have overlapping epitopes, they might present a different genetic barrier to a constantly changing influenza HA antigen.The cross-reactive Nbs NB37X-01 and NB37X-05 were shown to bind only full length H7-HA0 with the absence of binding to the H3-HA1 head domain (Fig. S3) suggesting the epitope(s) lie(s) within the more conserved stem region. The H7-HA0 library was selected separately with NB37X-01 and -05, and identified five residues (M102, E103, E114, M115, Y119) that specifically interfered with Nb binding (Fig. 4a,b) which all mapped to the HA stem. None of the HA stem mutations had any effect on the binding of the Nbs (NB7-01 to 17) which have epitopes in the head domain. In addition, both M102 and M115 were mutated to more than one residue reflecting the importance of these residues. The entire panel of cross-reactive Nbs showed loss of binding to all 5 mutants with the exceptions of NB37X-04 and NB37X-06, which retained binding to the HA2-E114V mutation. This suggests they have a common physical footprint within the stem domain (Fig. 5). However, they could be placed in two epitope subgroups (Gp5a and Gp5b) based on the differential effect of the HA2-E114V mutation. This cross-reactive epitope sits within the HA2 helix of the stem which has a crucial role in influenza infection by mediating a large conformational change in the acidified endosomal compartment to initiate membrane fusion. We evaluated if binding of the heterosubtypic H3/H7 cross-reactive stem binding Nbs could be affected by this conformational change by mimicking it in vitro through exposure of HA to low pH. We used a yeast display based sandwich assay where we sub-cloned the H7-specific antibody NB7-14 into the yeast display vector to bind HA via the head domain and treated HA with different pH buffers followed by probing with the putative stem binding Nbs (Fig. 4c). All cross-reactive Nbs (NB37X-01 to 06) showed a substantial increase in binding upon low-pH treatments whereas the head binder NB7-04 bound HA at both pH 4.8 and pH 8.0 equally well (Fig. 4c). As NB7-04 and NB7-14 share an overlapping epitope footprint in the head domain the binding seen with the head specific nanobody indicates that trimeric HA is being detected in this assay format. This confirms that the cross-reactive Nbs bind to the HA stem region and suggests that they have preferential binding to the low pH conformation.Figure 4Epitope footprint of H3/H7 cross-reactive nanobodies.

Residue numbering is relative to HA2 domain. The Nbs used for epitope mapping are highlighted in blue. Commercial antibody MIA-H7-334 is included as positive control and retains binding to all mutants. Relative binding of Nbs to each displayed mutant were categorized as follows: ≤ 15% no binding (red), between 15 and 40% intermediate binding (orange) and ≥ 40% strong binding (green). *Represents retention of binding to the HA1 head domain carrying a non-relevant mutation HA1-S135A (c) yeast cells displaying the head specific Nb NB7-14 were incubated with HA treated with low and neutral pH and binding of the stem specific Nbs NB37X-01 and NB37X-05 was detected as mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). NB7-04 was a non-competing head specific nanobody control.Full size imageFigure 5HA structure showing nanobody epitope groups.

The structure shows HA1 domain (light green), HA2 domain (grey), and key residues for each epitope group, Gp1a (red), Gp1b/1c/1d (pink), Gp2 (yellow), Gp3 (blue) and Gp4 (brown).

The epitope footprint of these Nbs comprises E111, R163 and K164, and sequence comparison of the strains tested in ELISA identified this as a region of natural sequence divergence (Fig. 6) These two influenza strains have a naturally occurring substitution at K164 to either a glutamate (E) or asparagine (N) (Fig. 6). Of particular interest was our being able to select the naturally occurring HA1-K164E substitution from a yeast displayed error prone PCR HA library. This artificially generated mutation correlated with a naturally occurring sequence difference between the prototype low pathogenic and high pathogenic strains of A(H7N9)40. This suggests that yeast display may be used as a tool to investigate the evolution of the HA molecule under different selective pressures without the need to use live virus and high containment facilities.Figure 6Correlation of epitope Gp2 specificity to natural sequence divergence.

(c) Confirmation of specificity of NB7-03 and NB7-14 to yeast cells displaying the HA1-K164E mutation.Full size imageDiscussionTo date there have been 5 epidemic waves of zoonotic infections of influenza A(H7N9) with up to 1568 reported cases of human infection (https://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/201909_zoonotic_vaccinevirusupdate.pdf?ua=1) with a 40% fatality rate. During the 5th wave in 2016–17, the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HP) A(H7N9) raised significant concerns as unlike (LP) A(H7N9) it maintained the capacity to infect via both human and avian receptors41, 42. In preparation for any further adaptations in H7N9 which could threaten a pandemic, vaccines, anti-viral drugs and monoclonal antibodies which can be used for control, surveillance and as emergency prophylactics are essential.In this study we have isolated a panel of homo-subtypic H7 and hetero-subtypic H3/H7 cross-reactive Nbs. We demonstrate that alpacas immunised with a single H7 strain can yield Nbs with broad reactivity which can maintain binding and resistance to natural antigenic changes over a minimum of 17 years. We have also isolated Nbs which can distinguish between the most recent high pathogenicity avian influenza strain (HP) A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 and the low pathogenicity (LP) A/Hong King/125/2017 (Fig. 6). In many cases Nbs were very high affinity (less than 1 nM) reflecting extensive somatic hypermutation and optimisation by the alpaca immune system. This could be expected as to date alpaca’s are not thought to be a reservoir for IAV so should not have any prior immune history of exposure to group 2 viruses32. This is in contrast to many of the human monoclonal antibodies to H7N9 where very few somatic mutations are seen, suggesting the antibodies are derived from an early, essentially germline response, to the virus7, 19.To understand the functional significance of Nb cross-reactivity we have mapped their epitopes using yeast display and mutational scanning. This approach is not limited by the need to maintain infection as is the case with conventional viral escape assays which uses live influenza virus and high containment facilities28. Using yeast display we are able to do a comprehensive mutational scan which encompasses both physical and functional epitope footprints, which are only limited by the need to preserve a folded, conformationally correct HA molecule anchored to the yeast cell surface28. Our sequential analysis of selection on individual Nbs to identify HA mutations which disrupt binding, followed by screening on the wider Nb panel, has allowed the Nbs to be placed into 5 major epitope groups (Gp1, Gp2, Gp3, Gp4 and Gp5). Epitope group Gp1 was the largest group with 11 different Nbs which could be further divided into 4 sub-groups which, although sharing D67 as a key epitope residue (Fig. 5), showed clear distinctions in their physical footprint. This is consistent with each Nb having unique paratopes determined principally by their VHH-CDR3 sequence and being derived from different ancestor B cells. It is interesting to speculate that this information may be used to predict different trajectories for HA escape from binding and be useful in choosing optimum combinations of antibodies. This is an important consideration in designing multi-domain antibodies or antibody cocktails for therapeutic applications where targeting multiple epitopes has the potential to reduce the risks of viral escape. The generation of multi-domain antibodies using conventional monoclonal antibodies is complex, principally due to the antigen combining site requiring the stable pairing of two separate light chain and heavy chain polypeptides, thus chain-switching and product heterogeneity can be a problem in their production. In contrast, one of the advantages of Nbs is that all antigen activity is focussed on one independently folding binding unit which can be easily linked with other such binding units29, 33, 37. We have shown that by simple linking together of two NB7-14 binding units we can enhance its potency over 1000-fold to and IC50 of 113 pM (Fig. 2). This also highlights a simple route to multi-paratopic nanobodies using Nbs belonging to different epitope groups which could be compared for mutational escape using yeast display37. Multi-specific nanobodies to different epitopes on H7 could be stockpiled and bridge the gap until a vaccine is available during a pandemic emergency. Nanobodies have shown themselves to be capable of potent neutralisation of a range of different viruses including HIV-143, RSV44, rabies45 and influenza virus29, 38. Broad neutralising Nbs to pandemic influenza viruses could be expected to have considerable potential for therapy or prophylaxis and we have recently shown adeno-associated viral vector delivery is able to drive sustained high level expression in situ and protection of mice from both pandemic H1N1 and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N146.Human seasonal influenza A(H3N2) has been previously characterised as having 5 distinct antigenic sites (A, B, C, D, and E)47. The nanobody epitope Gp1 overlaps with antigenic sites E and A whereas epitope Gp4 overlaps with antigenic site D (Fig. S5). In analysing the diversity of 324 H7N9 sequences (Table S1), we saw a high degree of conservation in the epitope footprint of Gp1 Nbs with D67, L70 and S135 being absolutely conserved. The epitope group Gp1 is adjacent to the receptor binding site of HA and overlaps with antigenic site A, which is highly conserved amongst many H7 viruses, including strains of both Eurasian and North American lineages48, 49. Several human monoclonal antibodies which bind in this region from human donors exposed to H7N9 A/Shanghai/02/2013 and A/Anhui/01/2013 vaccines7, 19 have been shown to provide protection against H7N9 challenge, demonstrating the functional importance of this epitope48, 50 and their potential as therapeutics. Nbs, such as NB7-14, which map to this region (Fig. S5) may also similarly have potential as a therapeutic or emergency prophylactic.Nbs with H3/H7 cross-subtype reactivity and enhanced binding at low pH were located to the highly conserved HA stem and belonged to epitope Gp5 (Fig. 4) (Table S1). Previous studies have described 66.5% sequence identity between H3 and H7 subtypes in the HA2 domain compared to 37% in the HA1 head domain51. The stem region is crucial in mediating viral infection and undergoes a large structural re-arrangement in the acidified environment of the endosomal compartment. It has been proposed that H106 and adjacent residues comprising M102 and E103 within the Gp5 epitope footprint function as a sensor for the enhanced protonation of HA at low pH15. The increase in binding we see at low pH is consistent with Nbs showing preferential binding to the HA stem after it has gone through the specific pH dependent conformational change. Non-neutralising human antibodies with a pH sensitive binding have been described which correlated with increased phagocytosis in vivo20. As Nbs NB37X-01 to 06 bind to a similar pH sensitive epitope they may be capable of similar mechanisms of viral neutralisation after appropriate reformatting as Fc-fusions to mediate interactions with phagocytic effector cells46, 52, 53.Nanobodies binding to epitope group 3 had a unique specificity which doesn’t overlap with any of the previously described antigenic sites from human immune responses to H7N9 influenza47 and may reflect a uniqueness to the immune response in alpacas that has not been shaped by prior exposure to IAV. This binding specificity could be correlated to natural sequence divergence at K164 between low (LP) and high pathogenicity (HP) H7N9 influenza viruses. This is a further example of how yeast display and mutational scanning is able to correlate Nb specificity with natural sequence change, which, if applied predictively, could be used to assess the suitability of stockpiled nanobody reagents as new viruses emerge28, 30. To our knowledge we have described the first Nbs capable of distinguishing (HP) A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (H7N9) strain from (LP) A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (H7N9) and have been able to correlate this specificity to natural sequence divergence at K164 in the HA1 head domain. Since H7N9 presents in poultry with only mild symptoms, early warning signs of a pandemic may be extremely difficult to detect and the availability of specific Nbs formatted for rapid detection of this antigenic difference may be useful for influenza surveillance in the field using low cost biosensors54.In summary, we have isolated a panel of nanobodies to A(H7N9) which have been grouped on the basis of their epitopes and correlated this with their specificity and functional activity. They may be useful in monitoring the antigenic changes that occur in the HA of A(H7N9) during transmission in poultry, controlling the spread of virus in birds, or as emergency therapeutics in humans.MethodsReagents and influenza antigensWhole influenza virus inactivated antigen standards (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, NIBSC) used in this study were derived from strains: A/New York/107/2003 NIBRG-109 (H7N2) (08/362), A/Anhui/01/2013 NIBRG-268 (H7N9) (14/250), A/Mallard/Netherlands/12/2000 NIBRG-60 (H7N3) (07/336), A/Uruguay/716/2007 NYMC X-175C (H3N2) (08/278), A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 NIBRG-375 (H7N9) (18/196), A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) (13/116) and A/HongKong/125/2017 (H7N9) (IDVDV-RG58B, CBER-reference antigen #88),. Purified recombinant hemagglutinins were full length HA0: A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2), A/chicken/Netherlands/1/2003 (H7N7), A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7), A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) (Protein Sciences) and HA1 (aa 26-344) A/chicken/Netherlands/1/2003 (H7N7), A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (H7N9) (e-ENZYME). Reverse genetic influenza strain A/Anhui/01/2013 (H7N9) NIBRG-268 was used.Construction and selection of phage and yeast displayed librariesAll methods performed on animals were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. All experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the National Institute for Biological Standards (NIBSC) ethics committee and performed under United Kingdom Home Office License (PBF57622). A juvenile male alpaca was purchased through the Royal Veterinary College, Hertfordshire, UK. Primary immunisation and each subsequent boost was with 50 µg of purified H7-HA from A/Netherlands /219/2003 (Protein Sciences) and sample collection was performed as in29. For antibody library construction approximately 10 ml samples of blood were collected from a immunised alpaca into heparinised tubes. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were purified using a ficol hypaque centrifugation procedure (Sigma-Aldrich) and RNA was extracted using a RiboPure RNA extraction kit (Novagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT primer with 200 ng of total RNA per reaction. A phage displayed library was constructed in pNIBS-1 vector as described previously29. This vector allows both phage display and production of soluble VHH nanobody fragments appended with a Histidine purification tag and a c-Myc epitope tag for detection of binding in ELISA.Phage antibody library selections were performed essentially as in29 using immunotubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated overnight at 4 °C with 1 ml of 10 µg/ml recombinant H7-HA (Protein Sciences) or whole influenza virus inactivated antigen standards (NIBSC) reconstituted in PBS. Bound phage antibodies were eluted by adding 1 ml of 100 mM triethylamine followed by incubation for 10 min on a rotating platform at room temperature. The eluted phage were neutralised with 0.5 ml 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5. To amplify the selected phage for subsequent rounds of selection 1 ml of eluted phage were mixed with 5 ml of an Escherichia coli ER2738 (Agilent Technologies) culture grown to an OD600 of 0.5 and 4 ml of 2 × TY media followed by incubation in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min. This was then spread onto 22 cm bioassay dishes containing 2 × TY agar supplemented with 100 µg/ml (w/v) carbenicillin and 2% (w/v) glucose. Plates were grown overnight at 37 °C and harvested and the phage titres before and after selection were determined29.Yeast antibody libraries were generated using the same cDNA used for the construction of the phage libraries as template. Antibody genes were amplified with oligonucleotides: Alp_FR1_Sfi1_YRec (gggcggaggatctggtggcggaggttctgcggcccagccggccATGGCACAGKTGCAGCTCGTGGAGTCNGGNGG) and Alp_FR4back_Not1_YRec (tccaaacccaacaatgggtttgggattggcttaccagcggccgc TGAGGAGACGGTGACCTG), where uppercase sequences anneal with antibody sequence extended lowercase sequences are included for subsequent yeast recombination and Sfi1/Not1 restriction sites are underlined. For each library, 20 µg of amplified PCR product was co-transformed with 20 µg of Sfi1/Not1 digested pNIBS-5 vector28 into S. cerevisiae EBY100 competent cells. pNIBS-5 is a yeast display vector which allows the display on yeast of proteins appended with a N-terminal SV5 epitope tag for detection. The final library size was determined through serial dilutions on selective plates as 2.25 × 107 clones. Standard procedures and recipes for growth, induction, yeast cell labelling, media and buffer preparation were used28. For yeast cell analysis and sorting we used 70 nM recombinant HA (eENZYME) followed by primary reagents monoclonal mouse anti-SV5 (Bio-Rad, MCA1360) and biotinylated monoclonal rabbit anti-His (Bethyl Laboratories, A190-114B) and by secondary reagents monoclonal goat anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor488 (Thermo Fisher, Scientific, A11029) and streptavidin AlexaFluor647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, S32357). For sorting ~ 108 cells were labelled in the first round and 50,000 events were sorted decreasing to 5,000 events for subsequent rounds. Yeast plasmid DNA was purified from the final outputs and transformed into TG1 electro-competent Escherichia coli cells and 24 single bacterial colonies were sequenced to identify there VHH-CDR3 sequence. All yeast cell analysis and sorting was performed on BD Canto II or BDAria III flow cytometers (Becton Dickinson) respectively. Data was analysed using FlowJo 10.4 software28.Nanobody expression and screeningPrimary screening was carried out in a 96 well ELISA plate (Nunc) coated with recombinant HA at 1 µg/ml overnight in PBS at 4 °C29. Influenza virus antigen standards (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, NIBSC) were reconstituted in 1 ml sterile water or PBS and then diluted 1/200 in 0.5 M bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6 prior to incubation overnight at 4 °C in a 96 well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For primary screening soluble VHH antibodies were harvested from culture supernatants in a 96 well format. In short individual colonies from each round of selection were inoculated into 100 µl of 2 × TY medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml (w/v) carbenicillin and 2% (w/v) glucose in a 96 well flat bottom plate (Corning) using sterile toothpick and grown overnight in a shaking incubator at 30 °C. From this master plate a new 96 well round bottom plate containing 100 µg/ml (w/v) carbenicillin and 0.1% (w/v) glucose was grown at 37 °C for 6 h until OD 600 of approximately 0.9 was reached after which time 30 µl of 2 × TY supplemented with 100 µg /ml (w/v) carbenicillin plus 5 mM IPTG (1 mM final concentration) was added and incubation continued overnight. The plates were then centrifuged at 600 × g for two minutes and supernatants containing the soluble VHH nanobodies were harvested and tested in ELISA. After addition of 100 µl of nanobody to individual wells and incubation for 1.5 h at room temperature, wells were washed with PBS and PBS-tween 0.1% (v/v) before 100 µl of anti c-myc 9E10-HRP (1/1000 dilution) (Roche) in 2% (w/v) milk powder was added and binding detected at OD 450 nM using TMB after 15 min incubation at room temperature. In all ELISA’s a negative control nanobody with no known specificity was used. For their large-scale production, cloned VHH gene fragments were transformed into the non-suppressor Escherichia coli strain WK6, expressed and purified28, 29. Nanobodies were purified from periplasmic preparations using immobilised metal chelate chromatography from the periplasmic fraction using Talon resin (Clontech). Eluted antibodies were dialysed against PBS using dialysis cassettes of molecular weight cut-off of 3 kDa (Thermo Fisher Scientific)29.Nbs were converted into bivalent molecules using a (G4S)6 linker to fuse two Nb binding domains ‘head to tail’. Sequences of each nanobody unit were optimised to limit the percentage of GC content and to reduce internal homology within the construct. Constructs were assembled by PCR from overlapping oligonucleotides, sub-cloned into pNIBS-1 and transformed into the Escherichia coli strain WK6. Bivalent nanobodies were expressed and purified as above.Lentiviral pseudotype assaysLentiviral pseudotypes were produced by transient co-transfection of HEK293T/17 cells using polyethylenimine. Plasmid p8.91 encodes the structural (gag, pol) genes and pCSFLW represents the genome incorporated into the pseudotypes bearing the firefly luciferase reporter. Influenza A hemagglutinin genes, in the expression plasmid pI.18 were also added to this mix alongside the Human Airway Trypsin (HAT) expression plasmid, pCAGGS-HAT, to allow for HA0 to HA1/2 maturation. The pseudotype based micro-neutralisation assay (pMN) was carried out in Nunc F96 microplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 1:2 serial dilutions of nanobodies were performed across the 96-well plate in a total of 50 µl DMEM + 10% (w/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin. HIV-1 derived lentiviral pseudotypes bearing influenza HA were then added to yield a relative luminescence unit (RLU) input of 1.5 × 106 per well, in a total volume of 50 µl. Plates were then incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for one hour, after which 1.5 × 104 HEK293T/17 cells were added per well in a total volume of 50 µl. After 48 h, supernatants were removed and a 50:50 mix of PBS and Bright-Glo (Promega Corporation) was added to each well. Plates were incubated at room temperature for five minutes and then luminescence was read using a Glomax luminometer (Promega Corporation). Signals were normalised to cell and virus only controls, representing 100% and 0% neutralisation respectively. IC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism.Analysis using surface plasmon resonanceFor binding and affinity ranking against different full length recombinant HA0 and HA1 head domains we used single cycle kinetics on a Biacore T100 machine (GE Healthcare)39. In brief, HA was immobilised onto a Biacore CM5 chip in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5 using an amine coupling kit (GE Healthcare) to create surface densities of between 1000 and 3000 RU. A concentration series of purified nanobody were sequentially run over the different antigen surfaces ranging from 1 to 25 nM. A reference surface was subtracted prior to evaluation of the sensograms using the single cycle kinetics procedure of the Biacore T200 evaluation 3.1 software (GE Healthcare) in combination with a 1:1 fitting model.Yeast display of hemagglutinin, error-prone library construction and screeningFull length HA0, HA1 and HA2 (A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7, D1-V508 mature protein numbering, HA1: D1-R323, HA2 G1-V185) respectively, were codon optimized for yeast expression and synthesised, including SfiI-NotI restriction sites (Integrated DNA Technologies), cloned into the yeast display vector pNIBS-5 and transformed into S. cerevisiae EBY10028. Standard procedures and recipes for growth, induction, yeast cell labelling, media and buffer preparation were used. Staining with purified Nbs was performed by incubating cells with 100 nM of Nbs followed by monoclonal mouse anti-SV5 (Bio-Rad, MCA1360) and polyclonal chicken anti-cMyc (Bethyl Laboratories, A190-203A) followed by secondary reagents monoclonal goat anti-mouse IgG AlexaFluor488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11029) and goat anti-chicken IgG AlexaFluor647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 103-605-155). Anti-influenza control H3 and H7 specific antibodies MIA-H7-334 and MIA-H3-501 were used (eEnzyme). Labelled yeast cells were analysed on BD Canto II or BDAria III flow cytometers.Error prone PCR amplification of the HA gene was carried out using a GeneMorph mutagenesis kit according to manufacturer’s instruction (Agilent Technologies) and 20 µg of mutated PCR product was co-transformed with 20 µg of Sfi1/Not1 digested pNIBS-5 yeast display vector28 into S. cerevisiae EBY100 competent cells (Invitrogen). The final library size was determined through serial dilutions on selective plates, and yeast plasmid minipreps of the library was transformed into TG1 electro-competent Escherichia coli cells (Agilent Technologies) for single colony sequencing. Individual colonies were picked and sequenced to assess mutation frequency. The yeast library was grown in selective medium for induction of HA display. 108 cells were co-stained with 100 nM Nb, followed by anti-SV5/anti-cMyc antibodies to detect Nb binding and HA display using fluorescent secondary reagents as described above. Flow cytometric cell sorting was performed using BDAria III. For the first round of a sorting a gate was chosen to sort cells displaying HA (by virtue of anti-SV5 signal) but absence of nanobody binding (lower right quadrant of a FACS dot plot). A second round was performed using the same sorting conditions. A third round of ‘positive’ sorting was done using 200 nM of a non-competing nanobody of NB37X-01 for epitope mapping of HA1 specific nanobodies (NB7-14, NB7-08, NB7-15, NB7-03, NB7-05) and NB7-14 for epitope mapping of the stem specific nanobodies (NB37X-01, NB37X-05). Yeast plasmid DNA was purified from the final outputs and transformed into TG1 electro-competent Escherichia coli cells and single bacterial colonies were sequenced. Sequence reads were assembled and aligned to the wild-type HA0 or HA1 genes to identify candidate mutations. Yeast clones with defined mutations were separately labelled for HA display and Nb binding. The Nb binding mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each Nb-mutant HA pair was divided by the MFI value of the wild-type H7-HA interaction, and the resulting ratio normalised to percentage values. Binding was categorized as follows, ≤ 15% no binding, between 15 and 40% intermediate binding and ≥ 40% strong binding (green). ReferencesDawood, F. S. et al.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has expanded the approval of Rapivab® (peramivir injection; BioCryst) to include treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients 6 months of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days. Previously, the treatment was indicated for patients aged 2 years and older. The expanded approval was based on data from a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial. The trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of peramivir, an influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitor, in patients 6 months to 17 years of age with acute uncomplicated influenza who had a fever greater than or equal to 37.8°C with at least 1 respiratory symptom or a positive influenza rapid antigen test. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous dose of peramivir 600mg (13 to 17 years of age) or 12mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 600mg (6 months to 12 years of age), or oral oseltamivir twice a day for 5 days. In the peramivir arm, the median time to alleviation of combined influenza symptoms was 79 hours (interquartile range: 31-126 hours) compared with 100 hours (interquartile range: 57-145 hours) in the oseltamivir arm. The median time to recovery to normal temperature (less than 37°C) was 40 hours (interquartile range: 21-68 hours) with peramivir and 35 hours (interquartile range: 16-42 hours) with oseltamivir. “Influenza can have serious and deadly consequences and we are very pleased that the FDA has extended the approved indication for Rapivab to include patients as young as 6 months,” said Dr William Sheridan, chief medical officer of BioCryst. “These patients can be among those at greatest risk for severe outcomes and Rapivab is an important antiviral with proven benefits.” Rapivab is supplied in single-use vials containing 10mg/mL strength solution for intravenous infusion following dilution.

Video Ad Feedback What life is like in Wuhan 1 year after the lockdown 04:24 - Source: CNN CNN — A team of World Health Organization investigators in China researching the origins of the coronavirus tell CNN they now have months of Chinese influenza data which might contain vital clues as to the early spread of the virus. On Sunday, the team visited the wet market thought to be central to the disease’s spread: The now disinfected and shuttered Huanan seafood market in the city of Wuhan, where an initial cluster of pneumonia-like illnesses were noticed by doctors in mid-December 2019. The market has become the anecdotal ‘ground-zero’ for COVID-19, even though later studies have suggested it may have begun elsewhere.

It gives you a good idea of the state of the market in terms of maintenance, infrastructure, hygiene and flow of goods and people.” The team was able to talk to locals and workers, said Ben Embarek. He cautioned it was too early in their investigations to draw conclusions. “It’s clear that something happened in that market,” Ben Embarek said. “But it could also be that other places had the same role, and that one was just picked because some doctors were clever enough to link a few sporadic cases together.” Investigative team members of the World Health Organization visit Huanan seafood market in Wuhan on January 31, 2021 in Wuhan, China. Getty Images Another WHO team member, Professor Thea Fisher, told CNN she’d been surprised by the “usefulness” of seeing a market that had been deserted for the past year. “We had some very good public health people with us who had actually been undertaking some of the environmental sampling at the market. …explaining to us exactly where did they take the samples from the ventilation system.” “It’s quite a shock to see place,” said another team member, ecologist and zoologist Peter Daszak. “All the stores are empty, the equipment’s still there. It’s a little bit eerie.” According to Ben Embarek, the team is scheduled to next visit the Centers for Disease Control in Hubei and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where they expected to meet She Zhengli, the virologist known as “Bat Lady” for her lengthy investigation of the bat coronaviruses, which scientists say are a close cousin to SARS-COV-2. The Wuhan Institute has gained notoriety after a series of unsubstantiated, evidence-free claims by senior Trump officials that the laboratory was the source of the virus that has infected over 100m worldwide. Ben Embarek also revealed that Chinese officials gave the WHO team important data about influenza, or flu-like diseases, spotted by China’s sophisticated disease surveillance systems in and around the region of Hubei in the months preceding the December 2019 outbreak. “We have data for the whole province and also beyond – looking at data from other neighboring provinces and going back several months…There is a lot of stuff to look at. It’s important to be able in the months before [the outbreak] to go down to a much lower level, and try to pick up signals, and see was there anything there that we can we could link,” he said. A CNN investigation revealed last year that a huge spike in influenza cases occurred in two cities close to Wuhan – Yuanan and Xianning – in the first week of December 2019. The previously unreported influenza spike was disclosed by leaked Chinese government documents obtained by CNN. It remains unclear what impact or connection that outbreak may have had on the Covid-19 outbreak. Ben Embarek described the approach of Chinese authorities, who have been earlier criticized for the slow admission of the WHO team, as “transparent.” “We see what we ask to see,” he said, adding the Chinese authorities had been flexible and that he hoped for future trips after this first 14 day mission. But Fisher said work was sometimes complicated by the sheer size of the group that undertakes some visits in China. “It’s my hope with some of the visits in the coming days that we can go in smaller groups. It is harder to build up a relationship [with an interviewee] in a very short amount of time …if you are 50 people sitting around listening.” Nick Paton Walsh reported from London and Sandi Sidhu from Hong Kong.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seasonal influenza cases in the U.S. remain lower than usual for this time of year, with most areas experiencing minimal reported activity. While it’s most likely our social distancing, mask wearing and extra sanitizing to thank for this, the flu vaccine still has a role to play this season. Researchers from the University of Missouri School of Medicine published their study on the flu vaccine’s impact on COVID-19 pediatric patients. The team found that children who received the seasonal flu shot were less likely to suffer symptoms from COVID-19 infection. “It is known that the growth of one virus can be inhibited by a previous viral infection,” said Anjali Patwardhan, M.D., professor of pediatric rheumatology and child health. Patwardhan reviewed the records of 905 children who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 from February through August 2020. Those who had received the flu vaccine during flu season had better odds of being asymptomatic and avoiding respiratory issues or severe disease. “Research on the pediatric population is critical because children play a significant role in influencing viral transmission,” Patwardhan said. “Understanding the relationship and co-existence of other viruses alongside COVID-19 and knowing the vaccination status of the pediatric patient may help in deploying the right strategies to get the best outcomes.” These findings are in alignment with another study done in COVID-19 patients aged 10 and up by Günther Fink, PhD, University of Basel and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute. Looking at over 53,000 patients hospitalized in Brazil between January 1 and June 23, 2020, mortality was consistently lower across all age groups in patients who received a flu vaccine in March 2020 or later. Absolute mortality ranged from a risk difference of 12% in patients 10-19 years old to 3% in patients over 90 years old. Overall, the study found that those who received the influenza vaccine in 2020 but prior to the onset of the pandemic had 17% lower odds of mortality. Surprisingly, when the vaccine was administered after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, mortality odds dropped 36%. “This phenomenon is called virus interference, and it can occur even when the first virus invader is an inactivated virus, such as the case with the flu vaccine,” Patwardhan said. Researchers in both groups also considered other factors that may apply here. For example, smoking is generally more common among those who do not get vaccinated, which could impact COVID-19 disease outcomes. Medical comorbidity actors such as diabetes or obesity were ruled out through the hospital records. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected minority communities in our nation and across the world. Patwardhan hypothesized that the higher incidence of COVID-19 in these populations may be linked to their consistently lower vaccination rates, apart from other health inequalities. The study was recently published in the journal Cureus.

By Chad Aldeman | February 2, 2021 By Chad Aldeman February 2, 2021 I have some bad news: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to linger for decades. One mechanism is through education. As my series on educational disruptions has shown, children who miss school time suffer academic losses in the short run, and those effects are noticeable decades later in the form of worse economic outcomes and other quality-of-life metrics. In the case of a series of teacher strikes in Argentina, researchers even found that the harmful effects passed down from one generation to the next. But babies born during the pandemic may also suffer. At least, that’s what happened in the wake of the 1918 flu pandemic, according to a widely cited 2006 paper by Columbia University’s Douglas Almond. Almond looked at the cohort of babies born in the wake of the flu outbreak that hit most severely in late 1918 and early 1919, then followed their life trajectories through 1980. Compared with children born just before or after, children exposed to the flu pandemic were less likely to finish high school, earned less money and were more likely to depend on welfare assistance. The harmful effects were twice as large for nonwhite children. May 1919 — Students in their “back yard workshop” in Denver, Colorado, while school was closed during the Spanish flu. (Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group / Getty Images) The graph below, from Almond’s paper, shows this clearly. During a period when educational attainment levels were rising markedly, children born in 1919 represent a clear outlier. In addition to suffering educational and economic outcomes, children born in the wake of the 1918 pandemic were more likely to have served time in jail or to report a work-limiting disability 60 years later. By 1980, adults born in 1919 had received 8 percent to 12 percent more in welfare payments than their peers who were born a year earlier or later. To be clear, Almond did not have data on a direct link between the influenza virus and its effect on children. The data necessary to make that point simply weren’t collected back then. It’s quite possible that Almond was actually observing economic effects, not anything tied to a mother’s health or viral strains that she may or may not have passed on to her children. September 1918 — Junior Red Cross, Gulf Division, from Wright High School in New Orleans. (Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group / Getty Images) Thankfully, babies and young children have been spared the worst health effects from COVID-19. About 2 percent of infants born to mothers who test positive near the delivery date have also tested positive within the first four days after birth. Recent studies from New York City and San Francisco have found that babies born to mothers infected with the virus were no more likely to suffer adverse outcomes in terms of birth weight, difficulty breathing or respiratory infections than babies whose mothers were not exposed. But those studies may be incomplete. While Almond’s research does not show evidence of a direct health link, the indirect economic effects he found are still worrying. For example, a Dutch study found that children born during recessions live fewer years than individuals born during economic booms. Similarly, a study on recessions in the U.S. found that young children and babies who live in the counties hit hardest by a recession face lower odds of graduating from college, earn less money and are more likely to live in poverty as adults. RelatedAldeman: What a Wave of Teacher Strikes in Argentina Can Teach Us About Learning Disruptions, Degree Attainment, Higher Unemployment & Lower Earnings The 1918 pandemic itself led to a sharp, albeit brief, economic shock that slowed manufacturing and industrial output. Partly because the country was in the midst of fighting World War I during the worst months of the pandemic, the economy rebounded quickly. In contrast, economists aren’t expecting a full economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic for at least a few more years. We may need to wait a few years to see whether the economic effects of COVID-19 start to materialize. For example, a study that came out last year found that babies born in California during the depths of the 2007-09 recession had lower birth weights and a higher likelihood of pre-term birth compared with babies born before or after the recession. Again, socially and economically disadvantaged groups suffered the largest effects. RelatedAnalysis: Research Shows Students Lose Learning Even During Brief School Closures for Snow Days. Those Case Studies Show the Harm From COVID Will Be Multiplied Many Times Over These are ominous findings suggesting that hidden economic factors may influence a child’s life in ways that aren’t obvious in the moment. But hopefully, they give policymakers more reasons to speed economic recovery efforts and make sure they deliver benefits to families and children who are going to need them the most.

Vaccines remained unavailable for viral diseases caused by familiar pathogens (such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and most herpesviruses), as well as for viral diseases caused by emerging pathogens (such as avian influenza, Ebola, and Zika viruses). In September 2019, just a few months before the current pandemic, the state of vaccine development and manufacturing was the subject of a review article that appeared in the Journal of Virology. The review’s authors, led by the Burnet Institute’s Gregory A. Tannock, PhD, DSc, noted that in previous decades, vaccines against polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B viruses became available. It was a golden age. Then, after 1990 or so, relatively few new vaccines progressed to licensing. The decline, according to Tannock and colleagues, might have reflected the scarcity of “low-hanging fruit,” the economic constraints faced by profit-driven operations, and the lack of substantial government intervention. Today, less than a year and a half after this somber assessment, vaccine development and manufacturing has been reinvigorated, largely due to the urgency imposed by COVID-19. Late in 2020, two COVID-19 vaccines—one from Pfizer and BioNTech, and one from Moderna—were approved for emergency use authorization. Many others are in development and clinical trials. To address the ugent need for a vaccine to combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Pfizer began putting vaccine manufacturing infrastructure in place while still engaged in research and development. According to Charles Christy, head of commercial solutions, Ibex Dedicate, Lonza, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been driving progress with several vaccine formats including inactivated vaccines, nonreplicating vaccines, adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccines, DNA and mRNA vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, T cell–based vaccines, and more. It is clear that the COVID-19 emergency is speeding vaccine development. It also appears that vaccine development may gain enough momentum to overcome new challenges once COVID-19 is contained. Recent advances Of the new formats, mRNA vaccines are especially interesting, according to Christy. They offer significant potential advantages in terms of speed, platform production, and dose sparing. With these advantages, mRNA vaccines could facilitate the rapid treatment of global populations. Speed was certainly evident during production of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273). This vaccine went from sequence selection to preclinical evaluation in 63 days. Also, just 10 months after the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), mRNA-1273 had entered commercial production. Moderna, which has entered a strategic collaboration with Lonza to manufacture up to 1 billion doses annually, currently has 23 mRNA development candidates with 12 in clinical studies across a wide range of indications. “New advancements in mRNA vaccines and other novel vaccines may mean that we are entering a new golden age for vaccines,” says Christy. “However, important work remains to ensure global access, adequate capacity, and ease of administration. In addition, the industry has a key education task to ensure widespread uptake.” Extra benefits “The first demonstration that RNA-based vaccines can protect you against infectious disease is clearly a major advance in vaccine development and production,” says Philip Dormitzer, MD, PhD, vice president and CSO, Viral Vaccines R&D, Pfizer. The RNA-based vaccine against COVID-19 developed by Pfizer and BioNTech reflects several technological choices. The partners eschewed biological living substrates, made use of an enzymatic process to produce the RNA, and took advantage of structure-based protein design to stabilize the antigen in its prefusion conformation. Pfizer’s Pearl River Laboratory Structure-based antigen design also showed that the key antigen used in previous respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines was in the wrong conformation. A structurally designed Pfizer maternal RSV vaccine with higher immunogenicity is currently in a Phase III trial. In the pandemic’s wake, advances in vaccine development have been paralleled by advances in vaccine manufacturing. Typically, manufacturing and scale-up investment is withheld until a proof-of-concept study has demonstrated a vaccine’s efficacy. Due to the vast societal need, Pfizer invested in manufacturing infrastructure while the company was still engaged in research and development. All the while, Pfizer maintained the same quality standards it applies during normal vaccine development. Lessons learned during the development of COVID-19 vaccines could be applied to the reengineering of legacy vaccines, says Dormitzer, especially those most in need of performance improvements. Such legacy vaccines include flu vaccines. From year to year, the flu vaccines vary in efficacy depending on how well they match the flu viruses in circulation. “In a good match year, the vaccine will provide 60% efficacy, which is far from the 95% we are seeing with the COVID-19 vaccine,” notes Dormitzer. “In mismatch years, the efficacy can be as low as 10–20%.” “We would love to have an 80% effective vaccine,” he continues. “We think some of the RNA technologies can be brought to bear. With these technologies, you can change the vaccine to better match the changes going on in the virus without having to change processes. You need only minimal changes to assays.” RNA technology elicits not only antibodies but also a strong T-cell response. By increasing valency and adding T-cell immunity to antibody-mediated immunity, it may be possible to increase the breadth of the flu vaccine so that every vaccine strain covers a greater range of the circulating viruses. If RNA technology is to be exploited to the full in countering influenza, it may be necessary to accommodate the different capabilities possessed by national influenza laboratories. Worldwide, there are over 130 national influenza laboratories. They constitute a large network. However, some of the laboratories may be better positioned than others to collect, analyze, and share the kinds of information needed by developers of RNA vaccines. Change drivers Effective vaccines are still needed against many older viruses such as Marburg virus, Lassa virus, RSV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and chikungunya virus. Effective vaccines are also needed for many newer viruses. Since 1980, scientists have identified more than 80 emerging viruses including H5N1 virus, H1N1 virus, human rhinovirus species C, MERS-CoV virus, and Nipah virus. On average, two novel viruses are identified each year. Despite recent successes—for example, the Ebola vaccines VSV-EBOV and AdVac/MVA-BN—new vaccines need to be generated more quickly. One way to expedite vaccine development is to exploit rational vaccine design. According to Christy, rational vaccine design is now driven by bioinformatics, massive advances in sequencing speed and capabilities, and a better understanding of immunology. Vaccine manufacturing can also realize benefits, such as improved yields and more robust processes, from enhancements in bioreactors and fermenters, closed systems, and purification processes. And enhanced analytical methods can help ensure safety, identity, purity, and potency. Cell-based vaccine manufacturing technology is replacing older technologies, such as egg-based production technology. Cell-based technology can help accelerate and scale up processes while allowing for simultaneous production of multiple viral vaccines. In addition, processes based on cell-based technology can incorporate insect cell cultures, DNA technology, and mRNA technology to generate improved vaccines. The implementation of new technologies and improved processes requires significant investment, as does the expansion of vaccine production infrastructure and manufacturing capacity. Global pre-investment by governments and organizations will need to be reinforced by ongoing investment if there are to be effective responses to future epidemics/pandemics. Besides exposing weaknesses in vaccine manufacturing, the COVID-19 crisis has also revealed the need to expand manufacturing capacity for monoclonal antibodies. Existing manufacturing capacity for monoclonal antibody treatments was already highly utilized before such treatments were deemed suitable for use against COVID-19. Manufacturing workflows New manufacturing platforms that have shown promise include viral vector vaccines that use genetically engineered viruses, such as adenoviruses, to transport genetic information that will code for a disease antigen within the body. An example of a viral vector vaccine is Ervebo, the Ebola vaccine that was approved by the FDA in 2019. In addition, the emerging mRNA platforms are providing agility to vaccine manufacturing. Because these platforms are modular and agnostic with respect to disease target, they allow vaccine variants to be generated and evaluated without requiring the manufacturer to modify or revalidate production processes. This is a massive change for an industry that usually dedicates one building or production area to one vaccine. Because viral vector and mRNA platforms are still maturing, their optimization and refinement remains important. “We are equipped to manufacture products for all platforms, including viral vaccines, viral vector vaccines, mRNA and pDNA vaccines, and recombinant protein vaccines,” says Amélie Boulais Raveneau, head of market entry strategy, Viral-Based Therapeutics, Sartorius. “We provide flexible solutions for vaccine manufacturing because we never know exactly what the market needs will be.” Flexible solutions often incorporate single-use technologies, which have grown significantly in popularity. Single-use technologies allow implementation and validation to be accomplished more quickly than is possible with traditional stainless-steel technologies, which require strict cleaning protocols. Single-use technologies promote flexibility by allowing facilities to pivot quickly to new modalities. Switching to single-use products also enables sustainability; retrofitting facilities for other modalities prevents future waste and reduces carbon footprints. “The simpler mRNA manufacturing process makes it easier to manufacture locally for streamlined distribution to a wider range of areas,” adds Boulais Raveneau. “We have seen this pandemic underscore the need for localized supply chains to allow manufacturers to mitigate their risk if disruption occurs in a certain region.” In addition, most of the frontrunners in the race for a COVID-19 vaccine demonstrate the critical advantage of ensuring collaboration and communication among all parties including developers, manufacturers, and regulatory bodies. However, Boulais Raveneau believes that there is still a long way to go to make workflows more efficient in general. For example, process intensification refers to protocols that enable manufacturers to cut down on time, steps, input material, and costs. Although this idea has been around for a while, she anticipates a wider implementation. Along the same lines, Bioprocessing 4.0—the automation of manufacturing workflows—will become increasingly important as manufacturers strive to improve efficiency. Oral vaccines Just-in-time delivery is advantageous for production and distribution facilities of all sizes, including the tiny ones known as living cells. For example, living cells can be used to generate mRNA and encapsulate it in virus-like particles. Thus packaged, the mRNA may be shipped to other cells, including the body’s cells, which accept delivery of the mRNA and use it to guide production of key viral proteins. Unlike DNA cargo, which may be integrated into the host genome, mRNA cargo limits genotoxic risks. However, mRNA is inherently unstable. When used as a vaccine format, mRNA poses challenges with respect to synthesis, stabilization, packaging, and delivery. “We have adopted mRNA as a core technology,” says David O’Hagan, PhD, co-founder, president, and CEO, Esperovax. “[We] deliver it orally to reach the intestines, which house 70% of the body’s immune system. Our vaccines work in situ. We synthesize the mRNA moments before it reaches the small intestine immune cells, which then present the patient-built proteins/antigens to the immune system. “Our proprietary oral vaccine approach should alleviate many of the limitations and logistical challenges faced by mRNA vaccine producers. And taking a pill or gummy is less intimidating than being poked with a needle. We expect this approach will lead to safer, more effective vaccines, and that it will reduce the fear of the vaccination process.” Esperovax’ proprietary method for bioengineering probiotic yeast is used to deliver continuous, high concentrations of vaccine antigen, protein, or mRNA, in the form of enveloped virus-like particles, directly to the lymphoid tissue (Peyer’s patches) of the gut mucosa, inducing strong immune protection. Esperovax uses Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a yeast species that has been instrumental in winemaking, baking, and brewing since ancient times, as an inexpensive way to deliver RNA to cells that are naturally designed to receive that signal. “By just using the same amount of yeast that brewers make in a day, we could vaccinate the entire world’s population 68 times,” observes O’Hagan. “The ability to rapidly produce vaccines that are shelf stable and based on mRNA would be a significant advancement.” The mRNA does not need to be protected from degradation. The yeast produces the RNA-containing nanoparticles seconds before use. A built-in switch prevents the cells from dividing, eliminating contamination of the broader ecosystem. The company currently has a contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to test an oral COVID-19 vaccine in mice and hamsters. The delivery technology could allow a rapid global response to any pathogen. Increases in population, in travel, and in food animal transport have exacerbated the evolution of new strains of pathogens. Once the COVID-19 pandemic passes, emphasizes O’Hagan, the world population must remain vigilant and invest heavily in protective measures against future diseases.

The data was released on GenBank, a partnership of the US, Europe and Japan.Two days later, that’s on January 12, China officially shared the GSD with the World Health Organization (WHO). This allowed its large network of influenza laboratories known as the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) to access this vital data.There was much praise for China for sharing the whole genome and associated data for the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 or SARS-CoV-2 less than two weeks after the first cluster was reported.This was critical in fighting the pandemic. The public availability of the high-quality data enabled scientists in laboratories around the world to quickly develop diagnostic test kits and kickstart the laborious work on antiviral medications and vaccines.A stellar example of this is the vaccine developed by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and its partner, biotech company Moderna, which had designed an experimental vaccine for the virus.Six months later, Phase 3 clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine were underway. Thus, too, came about the first NAAT and RT-PCR-based molecular tests to detect the deadly virus.This could be seen as a dramatic turnaround from 2007, when Indonesia refused to share with WHO the genetic sequences of the H5N1 virus which causes avian influenza. It claimed sovereignty over samples isolated within Indonesian territory and cited the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), a global agreement, as the legal basis for its claim.CBD mandates the sharing of benefits for allowing access to biological resources of a nation which have sovereign rights over it. Indonesia’s stance was that WHO was giving virus strains to pharmaceutical companies who used them to develop vaccines that were unaffordable to its population and those of other low and middle-income countries.It created a shock wave since Jakarta’s sovereignty claim was viewed as a violation of scientific norms of cooperation. Not that it was the only such instance.Other countries, too, had objections to WHO’s Global Influenza Surveillance Network, the predecessor of the GISRS, contending that it was hardly right that genetic material provided freely by countries are used by pharma companies to produce patented vaccines and therapies that are sold at huge profit to the same countries.Has the issue been resolved since then? Not really, although huge numbers of SARS-CoV-2 sequences have been shared on online databases, both public and private. The issue has surfaced every time there has been a serious outbreak of viral diseases, the Ebola virus attack in West Africa being a devastating case in point.The predatory nature of western nations and the pharma companies was clearly evident when global researchers allegedly appropriated and took back thousands of specimens and data without the permission of the authorities.WHO has now come up with a proposal to resolve the conflict, 13 years too late it could be argued, and indications are that a storm is brewing. The central dispute is whether CBD ought to be the defining pact to settle the issue.This was first published in the 1-15 February, 2021 edition of Down To EarthWorldScience & Technologycovid-19covid-19 pandemiccovid-19 testingcovid-19 outbreakavaian influenzaShow Comments Follow UsSubscribeHealthClimateAfricaNewsVideoData CentreBookshopNewsletterIn-depthBlogs© Copyright Down To Earth 2024.

Many original studies have been carried out to estimate disease burden of influenza in mainland China, while the full disease burden has not yet been systematically reviewed. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the burden of influenza-associated mortality, hospitalization, and outpatient visit in mainland China. We searched 3 English and 4 Chinese databases with studies published from 2005 to 2019. Studies reporting population-based rates of mortality, hospitalization, or outpatient visit attributed to seasonal influenza were included in the analysis. Fixed-effects or random-effects model was used to calculate pooled estimates of influenza-associated mortality depending on the degree of heterogeneity. Meta-regression was applied to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and Egger’s test. We identified 30 studies eligible for inclusion with 17, 8, 5 studies reporting mortality, hospitalization, and outpatient visit associated with influenza, respectively. The pooled influenza-associated all-cause mortality rates were 14.33 and 122.79 per 100,000 persons for all ages and ≥ 65 years age groups, respectively. Studies were highly heterogeneous in aspects of age group, cause of death, statistical model, geographic location, and study period, and these factors could explain 60.14% of the heterogeneity in influenza-associated mortality. No significant publication bias existed in estimates of influenza-associated all-cause mortality. Children aged < 5 years were observed with the highest rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations and ILI outpatient visits. People aged ≥ 65 years and < 5 years contribute mostly to mortality and morbidity burden due to influenza, which calls for targeted vaccination policy for older adults and younger children in mainland China.

Every year it causes an estimated 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and 290,000–650,000 respiratory deaths throughout the world1. The majority of influenza-related deaths occur in adults aged ≥ 65 years, accounting for over 85% of deaths2,3,4,5,6. Influenza is associated with 610,000–1,237,000 respiratory hospitalizations in children aged < 5 years worldwide annually7.A direct way to measure disease burden of influenza is usually based on syndromic surveillance for influenza. A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis by Shang et al.8 estimated the laboratory-confirmed respiratory hospitalizations attributed to influenza among children aged < 18 years in China. Considering under-ascertainment and under-reporting of influenza, indirect statistical modeling method provides more accurate estimates of influenza burden than those solely relying on laboratory-confirmed influenza case counts. Three nationally representative studies have estimated the influenza-associated mortality rates and ILI outpatient visit rates in mainland China by modeling techniques9,10,11. A 2019 systematic review by Li et al.12 described the influenza-associated mortality rates in mainland China by age group, cause of death, geographic location, and influenza virus type/subtype, but it did not produce synthesized estimates.Although many studies have been conducted in China to estimate disease burden of seasonal influenza, the findings vary across different study periods, regions, populations, circulating virus strains, and methodologies10,13,14. There is no quantitatively synthesized estimate available so far to guide national influenza prevention strategies and healthcare resource allocation. Our study aims to systematically review the Chinese and English literature of influenza-associated mortality, hospitalization, and outpatient burden in mainland China.MethodsSearch strategyWe followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines15 to conduct this review. Firstly, we searched 7 electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI [China National Knowledge Infrastructure], Wan-Fang Data, Chong-Qing VIP, and CBM [China Biology Medicine disc]) to identify relevant studies published from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2019. A search strategy was developed and adapted for each database with a combination of search terms in “all fields” and “title/abstract”. Keywords included: “influenza”, “burden”, “mortality”, “hospitalization”, “outpatient”, “China”, and other designators to indicate the contribution of influenza, such as “excess”, “associated”, “related”, “attributed”, “attributable”, “confirmed”. A full list of search terms and results was provided in Table S1. Secondly, reference lists of eligible studies, as well as the reference lists of reviews, were manually checked for additional studies. Thirdly, we searched additional electronic sources including Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) and Baidu Scholar (http://xueshu.baidu.com/). Titles and abstracts of the unique articles were screened by two reviewers (J.L. and Y.C.) independently. Full texts of all potentially eligible articles were retrieved and screened for final inclusion. Discrepancies in the study selection between the two reviewers were resolved by consensus or the involvement of a third reviewer (X.W.).Inclusion criteriaWe included published peer-reviewed articles in English and Chinese language. We constrained the starting year from 2005 because the influenza surveillance network became much more robust in China which was launched in 2000. Eligible articles were those reporting population-based rates of mortality, hospitalization, and outpatient visit attributed to seasonal influenza, using statistical modeling or laboratory-confirmed methods in mainland China. We included 6 most commonly used causes of death, coded according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10), which could be attributed to influenza infection: (1) all-cause (ICD-10: A00-A99); (2) respiratory and circulatory disease (ICD-10: J00-J99, I00-I99); (3) respiratory disease (ICD-10: J00-J99); (4) pneumonia and influenza (ICD-10: J09-J18); (5) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ICD-10: J40-J47); (6) ischemic heart disease (ICD-10: I20-I25). Considering that studies of influenza morbidity burden were few in China, we extracted rates as reported in the studies.Exclusion criteriaStudies were excluded if: (1) they were prediction studies; (2) only reporting estimates for a specific risk population, such as pregnant women or individuals with chronic medical conditions; (3) only reporting estimates for China’s special administrative regions (SARs); (4) the study period was less than a year or an influenza season; (5) population-based estimates of influenza burden could not be derived; (6) duplicate estimates, such as reporting estimates on a subset of published data or previous estimates that have been updated using the latest data; (7) they were reviews, conference proceedings, commentaries, editorials, and letters. Studies with a time frame combining both seasonal and pandemic influenza period were included, but we excluded the estimates for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Data extractionData were extracted into a predefined form by two reviewers independently and in duplicate (J.L. and Y.C.). For each included study, the following data were extracted: general characteristics of the studies, methodological characteristics, and primary outcome measures. The primary outcomes included: annual average influenza-associated mortality rates by age group (all ages, < 65 years, and ≥ 65 years) and cause of death; annual average influenza-associated hospitalization rates and outpatient visit rates by age group and case definition/discharge diagnosis code. If the burden estimates were reported by year, we calculated the average estimates directly. For studies only reporting the number of excess deaths, we calculated the excess rates by dividing excess numbers to the population sizes. Statistical models used to estimate influenza burden were classified as multiplier method, Serfling model, rate difference model, and regression model with an influenza activity proxy (including Poisson model, negative binomial model, and linear model). Geographic locations were defined as northern or southern China (demarcated by the Qinling Mountains-Huaihe River line8).Quality assessmentAs there was no existing appraisal tool for modeling studies, we modified Bhuia et al.’s developed checklist which had been used to assess models for estimating disease burden of asthma16. Laboratory-confirmed studies were assessed using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Series17. Both checklists were consisted of 10 items with a maximum score of 10 (Tables S2, S3). Studies with scores of 8 or greater were considered as high-quality studies. We evaluated the quality of the evidence for mortality outcome using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool18. The GRADE of observational studies is rated as low certainty of evidence. This rating can be downgraded by five domains (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias) and can be upgraded by three domains (large magnitude of effect, dose response, and attenuation by plausible confounding).Statistical analysisMeta-analyses were conducted to pool the influenza-associated mortality rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) when 5 or more estimates were reported. To examine the age-specific estimates of influenza-associated mortality rates across different causes of death, we stratified the meta-analyses by cause of death and age group. Statistical heterogeneity of the estimates was assessed using Cochran’s Q test and \({I}^{2}\) statistic19. If \({I}^{2}\) statistic was above 50% or P value of Q statistic was lower than 0.10, the estimates were pooled by random-effects model; otherwise, fixed-effects model was used. Standard errors (SEs) were used in the calculation of the precision of the pooled mortality estimates. If SEs cannot be directly derived from the 95% CIs, they were imputed by linear regression model using excess mortality rate, age group, and cause of death as predictors with a log-linked function20. The pooled estimates were standardized using the age structure of the 2010 population census of China21 as the reference.To explore the sources of heterogeneity in estimates of influenza-associated mortality rates, subgroup analyses and meta-regression analysis were performed by the following variables: age group, cause of death, statistical model, geographic location, and study period. The \({R}^{2}\) statistic was used to indicate the proportion of total variance explained by the covariates examined. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by excluding studies with quality scores below 8 in the meta-analyses. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and Egger’s test22.Meta-analyses on influenza-associated hospitalization and outpatient burden were not performed due to the paucity of studies. As the burden estimates may differ in urban and rural areas, Pearson correlation analysis was applied to explore the relationship between urbanization rate (urban population as a percentage of the total population) and influenza-associated mortality or morbidity.This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019133748. The flow diagram was drawn using Adobe Illustrator software, version 22.0.0 (https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). All analyses and other figures were performed using R software, version 3.5.2 (https://www.r-project.org/).ResultsStudy selectionWe identified 5,715 records through database searching and added 3 additional records through review of reference lists, among which 4,718 records were unique after removal of duplicates (Fig. 1). 4,614 records were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts. 104 full-text articles were retrieved for further assessment. Of these, 74 articles were excluded due to the following reasons: not relevant to influenza-associated burden estimates (n = 36), not original studies (n = 22), no population-based estimates of influenza burden derived (n = 10), duplicate estimates (n = 6). Finally, 30 articles were eligible for the systematic review including 22 reporting modeling estimated influenza burden and 8 reporting laboratory-confirmed influenza burden. 17 studies reporting influenza-associated mortality using modeling approach were included in the meta-analysis.Figure 1Flow diagram for systematic review process. *If several publications reported on the same study, we only included the publication that provided the most data. The flow diagram was drawn using Adobe Illustrator software, version 22.0.0 (https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html).Full size imageStudy characteristicsAmong the 30 included studies, 17 assessed influenza-associated mortality burden (all from modeling studies5,9,10,13,14,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,34), while 8 assessed influenza-associated hospitalization burden (2 from modeling studies35,36 and 6 from laboratory-confirmed studies37,38,39,40,41,42) and 5 assessed influenza-associated ILI outpatient burden (3 from modeling studies11,43,44 and 2 from laboratory-confirmed studies45,46) (Table S4). The study periods included pre-pandemic (n = 9), post-pandemic (n = 17), and both periods (n = 4). Lists of all included articles were provided in Tables S5 and S6. The 30 articles reported 84 regional estimates, mostly in the more developed eastern provinces, such as Jiangsu, Beijing, Guangdong, etc., consisting of 37 (44%) for northern China and 47 (56%) for southern China (Fig. 2).Figure 2The distribution of published studies about influenza-associated disease burden. Two studies of mortality burden were not shown in the figure because they reported combined estimates of multiple cities5 or Disease Surveillance Points (DSP) sites9. One study could have estimated influenza disease burden for multiple provinces or cities. The map was drawn using R software, version 3.5.2 (https://www.r-project.org/).Full size imageThe quality scores of included studies ranged from 7 to 10 points (Tables S7, S8). Most studies (25/30) were of high quality. Lack of model validation and no description of missing data were commonly seen in modeling studies, while no reporting of follow-up health outcomes was often observed in laboratory-confirmed studies.Eighteen studies used regression models with an influenza activity proxy5,9,10,11,13,14,24,25,26,27,28,29,31,33,34,35,36,36; 5 studies applied Serfling models5,23,27,32,34; 2 studies used rate difference models25,30; and 2 applied multiplier methods43,44 (Table S4). Four different influenza activity proxies were used in modeling studies: positive number of laboratory-confirmed influenza (LAB number), positive proportion of laboratory-confirmed influenza (LAB%), influenza-like illness consultation rate (ILI%), and product of positive proportion of laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness consultation rate (LAB% \(\times\) ILI%). The most commonly used influenza activity proxy (14/19) was LAB%. Smoothing function of time10,11,14,24,28,31,33 or the combination of linear, quadratic, cubic, and trigonometric functions of time5,9,13,23,26,27,29,32,34,35,36 was commonly used to account for time trends in the regression models. Some studies also included meteorological factors, such as absolute humidity only14,31 or the combination of temperature and absoluteelative humidity10,11,24,28,33 as confounders. Six of the 8 laboratory-confirmed studies used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing methods to confirm influenza from patient samples38,39,40,41,45,47, and the remaining used immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (n = 1)42 and hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) (n = 1)46 (Table S4). Three case definitions were used to identify patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) (n = 5)38,39,40,41,47, pneumonia (n = 1)42 or influenza-like illness (ILI) (n = 2)45,46. Details of the case definitions used in the laboratory-confirmed studies were shown in Table S6.Influenza-associated mortality burdenPooled estimates by cause of death and age groupPooled influenza-associated all-age mortality rates per 100,000 persons were as follows: all-cause, 14.33 (95% CI 11.56, 17.10); respiratory and circulatory disease, 10.89 (8.71, 13.07); respiratory disease, 5.84 (4.66, 7.03); pneumonia and influenza, 0.67 (0.27, 1.07); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 2.66 (1.50, 3.83); ischemic heart disease, 2.57 (0.97, 4.18) (Table 1). The pooled rates of influenza-associated all-cause and cause-specific deaths for adults aged ≥ 65 years were significantly higher than that for those aged < 65 years. Heterogeneity increased with age in the pooled influenza-associated mortality rates, from 0.0 to 53.6% for < 65 years to 97.5–99.7% for ≥ 65 years (Figs. S1–S6).Table 1 Pooled influenza-associated mortality rates per 100,000 persons by cause of death and age group.Full size tableSources of heterogeneityThe subgroup analyses found that influenza-associated mortality rates were different with statistical significance by age group and cause of death, while statistically insignificant by statistical model, geographic location, and study period (Table S9). When these variables were entered into the meta-regression, it yielded a significant model (F \(=\) 26.40, P \(<\) 0.001), that explained 60.14% of the heterogeneity in the estimates. The variation was significantly associated with age group, cause of death, and statistical model (Table 2). Estimates of influenza-associated mortality rates were higher for all ages and ≥ 65 years than for < 65 years and were higher with broader cause-of-death groups (Table 2, Fig. S7). Studies using rate difference models were generally associated with higher estimates than other models. The estimates were higher from southern China than from northern China and were higher in the pre-pandemic period than in the post-pandemic period, but the differences did not reach statistical significance (Table 2, Fig. S8). No strong correlation was observed between urbanization rates and influenza-associated mortality rates (Fig. S9).Table 2 Results of a meta-regression analysis conducted to identify factors that influence estimates of influenza-associated mortality.Full size tableSensitivity analyses, publication bias, and GRADEOur results were robust as the sensitivity analysis showed that the pooled estimates were similar to the main analysis (Table S10). No significant publication bias was found in most cause- and age-specific influenza-associated mortality estimates (Fig. S10), except for respiratory disease (all ages: P \(=\) 0.024, age-standardized: P \(=\) 0.001, and < 65 years: P \(=\) 0.042) and pneumonia and influenza (≥ 65 years: P \(=\) 0.005). The upgrade domains were not applicable to time series modeling studies. Beginning with a low-certainty rating, the certainty of evidence was downgraded by one level for most cause- and age-specific influenza-associated mortality rates, owing to inconsistency (\({I}^{2}>\) 50%, P \(<\) 0.001).Influenza-associated hospitalization burdenStudies reporting influenza-associated hospitalization burden were conducted in Jiangsu (n = 5), Beijing (n = 2), and Jingzhou (n = 1). Two studies used statistical modeling methods to estimate influenza-associated P&I hospitalization rates among children aged < 5 years (384 per 100,000 children)35 and < 15 years (112 per 100,000 children)36 in Jiangsu. Five of the 6 laboratory-confirmed hospitalization studies used SARI definition to screen inpatients37,38,39,40,41,47, while the remaining study used pneumonia case definition42. The influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rate in children aged < 5 years ranged from 442 in Beijing to 715 in Suzhou per 100,000 persons38,39,40,41,47, except that Jingzhou reported 2185 per 100,000 persons because of a lower fever threshold in case definition37 (Table S11).Influenza-associated outpatient burdenA national study provided estimates of influenza-associated ILI outpatient visit rates from 2006 to 2015 across 30 provinces, ranging from 0.1 in Ningxia to 7.4 in Shanghai per 1000 persons11. The highest influenza-associated outpatient visit rate was found in the age group < 15 years. We identified a significant positive correlation between urbanization rates and influenza-associated ILI outpatient visit rates across these provinces (r \(=\) 0.85, P \(<\) 0.001) (Fig. S9). Two studies using multiplier methods were conducted in Beijing and reported rates of influenza-associated ILI outpatient visits for the 2015–2016 season (22 per 1,000 persons) and 2017–2018 season (69 per 1000 persons), with the highest rates observed in children aged < 5 years (154 and 330 per 1000 persons respectively)43,44. For the remaining 2 laboratory-confirmed studies, influenza-associated ILI outpatient visit rates among children < 5 years ranged from 34 per 1000 persons in Zhuhai to 64 per 1000 persons in Suzhou45,46.DiscussionOur study systematically reviewed influenza-associated disease burden studies in mainland China, including estimates both from modeling approach and laboratory-confirmed approach. Mortality burden of influenza was assessed not only for respiratory deaths but also for circulatory deaths, which provided better understanding of the overall impact of influenza.The subgroup analyses indicated that the estimates of influenza-associated mortality were significant only in age group and cause of death. However, when controlling for other variables in the meta-regression, statistical model also became significant. In our meta-analysis, influenza-associated mortality rates by cause of death and age group showed high levels of heterogeneity, which might be due to the variation in statistical models. Robust estimates indicated by sensitivity analysis and no publication biases demonstrate the stronger certainty of evidence than original observational studies included in our review. Our study also benefits from the strengths of original studies including data from well-established surveillance systems and generally high-quality studies.In line with previous studies6,48,49,50, influenza-associated mortality rate was found the highest among adults aged ≥ 65 years. Our pooled influenza-associated respiratory mortality rate (5.84 per 100,000 persons) fell within the estimate for the Western Pacific region reported in a global study (3.6–7.5 per 100,000 persons)2. Our pooled estimates were also comparable with the corresponding estimates published for other countries or regions; e.g. our pooled excess all-cause mortality rate (14.33 per 100,000 persons) was similar to those reported in Europe (13.30 per 100,000 persons)48 and Hong Kong SAR (11.70 per 100,000 persons)6, but slightly higher than that reported in the USA (6.96 per 100,000 persons)49 and South Korea (5.97 per 100,000 persons)50. Our influenza-associated P&I (384 per 100,000 persons) or SARI (442–715 per 100,000 persons) hospitalization rate among children aged < 5 years was much higher than those reported for Singapore (excess P&I hospitalization rate of 186.8 per 100,000 persons)51, Portugal (excess P&I hospitalization rate of 42.6 per 100,000 persons)52, Chile (excess SARI hospitalization rate of 71.5 per 100, 000 persons)53. Children aged < 5 years had the highest excess SARI hospitalization rates in China, contrasting with higher rates among adults aged ≥ 65 years in above countries. However, it is difficult to make like-for-like comparisons between the countries’ estimates due to different healthcare seeking behavior or access to healthcare services. Lower mortality or morbidity rates in these countries could be partially explained by their higher vaccination coverage.Influenza vaccination can reduce the risk of illness caused by influenza virus infection by about 40–60% among the general population54, while the vaccination coverage in the Chinese population was only approximately 2%55. The highest influenza disease burden found among people aged ≥ 65 years and < 5 years in China highlights the priority to strengthen vaccination strategy in these two age groups. Unlike many high-income countries, influenza vaccination is not included in the National Immunization Program in China. Only a few developed cities such as Beijing have provided free influenza vaccination for older adults using local revenue and have achieved a remarkable increase in local vaccine uptake56. In addition, a recent cost-effectiveness study suggests that government fully funded immunization against influenza among older adults proves to be cost-effective for influenza control and prevention in China57. Our findings collectively with this evidence inform immunization recommendations in China.Methodological issuesIn our study, estimates of influenza-associated mortality rates from the Serfling models were lower than those from other models, which contradicts the conclusion of the previous review by Li, et al. that Serfling models were associated with higher estimates20. Serfling models would inherently overestimate the influenza burden because this approach attributes all excess deaths to influenza58. However, more conservative estimates were produced from Serfling models included in our study, primarily because only a small set of weeks were classified as epidemic weeks in calculating the influenza burden in the Serfling analysis after adding the restriction of “for 2 or more consecutive weeks”. The performance of different influenza activity proxies may differ in estimating the burden of influenza. Although LAB% was the most commonly used influenza activity proxy, ILI \(\times\) LAB may be more closely related to influenza incidence14. The choices of which meteorological factors to include in the models are still controversial. Several studies have demonstrated the role of temperature, relative humidity, or absolute humidity on influenza virus survival and transmission59,60. Of note, collinearity might be considered when using the combination of temperature and absolute humidity because absolute humidity can be calculated based on temperature and relative humidity. RSV and other pathogen activity were not considered in all the regression models because there is currently no national surveillance for the co-circulating respiratory viruses in China, which may have confounded the results.LimitationsOur study had several limitations. Firstly, high levels of heterogeneity existed across influenza-associated mortality studies. Although we applied random-effect model to account for the heterogeneity, the pooled estimates from meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution as it might not represent the national burden. Secondly, we did not assess the impact of predominant virus types/subtypes and high-risk populations because studies were too few after stratification, which could also be sources of mortality variation. Thirdly, we used a regression model to estimate the missing SEs; thus, the difference between estimated and true SEs may have influenced the estimates of pooled influenza-associated mortality.Future directionsOur review found that influenza-associated mortality burden was the most frequently reported outcomes, while there was a dearth of measure of influenza-associated morbidity burden which may also bring considerable health impact and consequent economic impact. The challenge in estimating influenza-associated morbidity burden lies in the fact that compared with standardized death registry procedure in mainland China, hospital discharge data and outpatient data with well-defined population denominators were not readily available. Promoting standardization of electronic medical record system in public hospitals in China is a prerequisite for healthcare data analysis and sharing61. Studies in our review mainly located in more developed eastern provinces with a high number of scientific research institutes and scientists. Promoting interprovincial collaboration on scientific research and data sharing is crucial to strength influenza-associated morbidity estimates in central and western regions of China, with the ultimate goal to get nationally representative estimates of the full disease burden of influenza. The highest influenza-associated mortality in adults aged ≥ 65 years and morbidity in children aged < 5 years indicates that increasing influenza vaccination coverage in these two age groups is necessary. Urbanization was found positively correlated with influenza-associated ILI outpatient visits but was not correlated with influenza-associated deaths. Considering the government may not be able to provide free shots to every eligible individual because of huge fiscal expenditure, roll-out of vaccine campaign for children and older adults in urban areas with high population density first may prevent substantial outpatient visits thus reducing healthcare usage. Further studies of the relative burden of influenza in urban and rural areas would be worthwhile to guide the formulation of more refined or localized public health policies.ConclusionIn conclusion, more studies in less-developed central and western provinces are needed in the future to assess the geographical distribution patterns of influenza in China as a whole. People aged ≥ 65 years and < 5 years contribute mostly to mortality and morbidity burden due to influenza, which calls for targeted vaccination policy for older adults and younger children in mainland China.
