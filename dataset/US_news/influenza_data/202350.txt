However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report that sub-lethally infected K18-human ACE2 mice show patchy pneumonia associated with histiocytic inflammation and collagen deposition at 21 and 45 days post infection (DPI). Transcriptomic analyses revealed that compared to influenza-infected mice, SARS-CoV-2-infected mice had reduced interferon-gamma/alpha responses at 4 DPI and failed to induce keratin 5 (Krt5) at 6 DPI in lung, a marker of nascent pulmonary progenitor cells. Histologically, influenza- but not SARS-CoV-2-infected mice showed extensive Krt5+ “pods” structure co-stained with stem cell markers Trp63/NGFR proliferated in the pulmonary consolidation area at both 7 and 14 DPI, with regression at 21 DPI. These Krt5+ “pods” structures were not observed in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected humans or nonhuman primates. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection fails to induce nascent Krt5+ cell proliferation in consolidated regions, leading to incomplete repair of the injured lung.

The residual lung abnormalities such as fibrosis were estimated in up to 11% of people discharged after COVID-19-related hospitalization1,2. Within 8 months of discharge after COVID-19 hospitalization, pulmonary abnormalities were still visually identifiable on thoracic follow-up CT scans1. These residual lung abnormalities minimally declined per week after discharge, and minimal resolution was observed in paired subsequent scans at least 90 days apart1. One-fourth of long COVID patients had lung zones with ≥10% presence of ground-glass opacities at three months post-discharge, and one out of five follow-up patients presented with parenchymal bands associated with early progression of fibrosis3. These changes are not limited to severe patients as there is evidence showing mild to moderate COVID patients also developed long respiratory COVID sequelae after clearing SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) shedding4. Fatigue, respiratory syndrome, and chest X-ray abnormalities were found in both intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospitalized patients at least 6 weeks post-acute phase5.The recent emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses has resulted in only a limited number of studies regarding the mechanisms involved in COVID-associated scarring and fibrosis. However, insight may be gained by comparing COVID infection to highly pathogenic H1N1 Flu infection. Flu infection causes epithelial changes as far out as 60 days but with limited scarring6. This ability to recover lung capacity after Flu infection has been demonstrated in both in vivo and in vitro studies7,8,9,10. This recovery involves multipotent basal cells that express keratin 511,12,13. During infection, basal cells proliferate and form nascent, discrete Krt5+ “pods” in the consolidation lung regions after Flu infection and contribute to epithelial recovery in the lung parenchyma12,14. However, it is unclear whether Krt5+cells are induced and expanded after acute CoV2 infection.To understand the mechanisms of lung recovery after acute CoV2 infection, we characterized a chronic COVID mouse model using a sub-lethal dose of CoV2 to infect K18 mice15,16 and compared their recovery with Flu-infected mice. We found that CoV2 and Flu infections mediate distinct pulmonary cellular and transcriptomic changes. CoV2, but not Flu infection fails to induce Krt5+ progenitor cell proliferation, leading to more persistent and chronic pulmonary consolidation and scarring than other respiratory viral infections.Results K18 mice infected with a sub-lethal dose of CoV2 have persistent lung abnormalitiesThe K18 transgenic mice express human ACE2, a CoV2 receptor under the transcriptional control of the human cytokeratin 18 promoter in airway epithelial cells17,18,19,20,21. We have shown that the K18 mice infected with a lethal dose (2 × 105 TCID50) of CoV2 develop severe acute pneumonia, and that all infected mice meet euthanasia criteria within 7 days post-infection (DPI)15. To examine the chronic impact of CoV2 infection on the lung, we infected the mice with a twenty-fold lower (1 × 104 TCID50) inoculum of CoV2 (Fig. 1a) (detailed mice information are shown in Supplementary Table 1). Both lethal and sub-lethal infections induced loss of body weight starting at 4 DPI (Fig. 1a); however, K18 mice infected with the sub-lethal dose of CoV2 failed to reach euthanasia criteria, re-gaining body weight starting at 8 DPI, and reaching the original body weight by 13 DPI (Fig.1a). We detected viral genomic RNA in the lungs of sub-lethal dose infected K18 mice at 21 DPI (Fig.1a). To further monitor the replication of CoV2, we assayed sub-genomic viral RNA load15,22. There were no detectable CoV2 sub-genomic viral RNAs in the lungs or brains of the infected K18 mice at 21 DPI (Fig. 1c). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed patchy consolidation in all three K18 mice at 21 DPI (Fig.1d) and two K18 mice at 45 DPI infected with sub-lethal dose (Supplementary Fig. 1a–h). In the nasopharyngeal cavity of infected K18 mice at 3 DPI, we found that SARS-CoV-2 S protein co-localized with lung epithelial marker Pan cytokeratin (PanCK)23 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). This result further demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 initially infects the epithelial cells of the large airways in this infected K18 mice model. Immunofluorescent (IF) staining showed the co-localization of CoV2 spike protein with surface macrophages marker CD206 on lungs of sub-lethal CoV2 infected mice at 21 DPI (Fig. 1e). The co-localized cells take up about 80% among CD206 macrophages in these three sub-lethally infected mice (Fig. 1f).Fig. 1: K18 mice infected with a sub-lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 sustain chronic lung injury (n = 3).a Male and female K18 mice were infected with 1 × 104 TCID50 (n = 3) or 2 × 105 TCID50 (n = 3) of SARS-CoV-2 intranasally and body weight changes were monitored.

K18 mice inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline were used as naïve control. Results were also compared with RNAseq analysis from K18 mice infected with a lethal CoV2 inoculum at 4 DPI from our previous study15. Compared to the naïve control, CoV2-infected K18 mice had increased expression of several collagen superfamily genes including Col1a1, Col28a1, Col5a2, Col3a1, Col15a1, Col1a2, Col5a1, Col6a3, Col4a5, Col27a1, Col8a1, Col7a1, Col16a1, Col4a4, and other extracellular matrix protein genes such as elastin gene Eln and clusterin gene Clu in lungs at 21 DPI (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Data 1, 2). Compared to infected K18 mice at 4 DPI, CoV2-infected K18 mice also had increased Col15a1 expression in the lung at 21 DPI (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Data 3). Moreover, we found evidence for higher activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathways (Fig. 2c,d, and Supplemental Fig. 2b) at 21 DPI compared to lung tissue from naïve or infected K18 mice at 4 DPI. Furthermore, compared to lungs of naïve K18 mice, CoV2-infected K18 mouse lungs at 21 DPI also had increased activation of hallmark inflammatory response and interferon-gamma pathways in addition to increased complement pathways and Kras signaling (Fig. 2c). Since the production of collagens, elastin and clusterin play an essential role in fibrotic responses after tissue injury24,25,26, these results indicate that sub-lethal infection with CoV2 induces a chronic inflammatory response and may mediate fibrosis in the lungs of K18 mice at 21 DPI.Fig. 2: Transcriptomic analysis of the lungs of K18 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 21 DPI and without infection, and of K18 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 4 DPI.Enhanced volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (a) and pathways (c) between sublethal SARS-CoV-2 dose-infected hACE2-K18 (1 × 104 TCID50) lungs (CoV K18 21 DPI) at 21DPI (n = 3) and K18 Naïve mice.

In a previous publication, pulmonary lesions were shown to persist for 60 days during experimental influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) infection6. However, unlike the fibrotic state induced by COVID, flu-induced transcriptomic and epigenetic changes are more often associated with repair6. To identify unique gene signatures that may drive the lung from a reparative state to a fibrotic state, we conducted bulk RNA sequencing analysis from the lungs of K18 mice infected with either CoV2 (2 × 105 TCID50) or H1N1 influenza (A/PR/8/34, 50 PFU)6,15,27 at 4 or 6 DPI and compared them with these obtained from Naïve K18 mice. A heatmap of these findings shows that at 4 DPI and 6 DPI compared with Naïve K18 mice, both Flu and COV2 infections significantly induced a greater number of pro-inflammatory genes such as Saa3 and chemokines such as Cxcl11, Cxcl10, Ccl, Ccl2, Ccl7. We also observed that Flu infection mediated higher induction of those gene expressions than CoV2 infection (Fig. 3a,b, Supplementary Data 4, 5).Fig. 3: Comparison of gene expressions between Flu and SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs at day 4 and day 6 post infection.Pulmonary RNA of 2 × 10^5 TCID50 dose-SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 mice and Influenza virus (50 PFU) infected B6 mice were collected and sequenced at 4 DPI (n = 3) and 6 DPI (n = 3).

At 4 DPI, both infections induced similar weight loss. However, compared to CoV2 infection, Flu infection significantly induced a greater number of pro-inflammatory genes (Irg1, Saa3, Il6) and chemokines (Cxcl11, Cxcl10, Ccl7, Ccl2, Cxcl2, Ccl1) (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Data 6). Pathway analysis revealed a greater induction of type I and type II interferon (IFN) pathways, as well as TNF alpha signaling via NFκB pathways in Flu infected mice compared to CoV2-infected mice at 4 DPI (Fig. 3e and Supplemental Table 2). TNF alpha signaling via the NFκB pathway and the inflammatory response pathways remained significantly elevated through day 6. In addition, Flu infection also significantly induced higher activation of P53, Kras signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and apical junction pathways compared to CoV2 infection at 6 DPI (Fig. 3f and Supplemental Table 3). Moreover, three keratin genes (Krt16, Krt15, Krt5) were also significantly induced in Flu-infected mice, suggesting epithelial changes (Fig. 3d). Of particular interest was Krt5, which is a marker for lung progenitor basal cell keratin 5, a protein that has been associated with Flu injury and repair14,28.Krt5+ cells are not found in pulmonary consolidation regions during CoV2 infectionThe finding that CoV2 infection had substantially lower expression of Krt5 transcripts at 6 DPI prompted us to investigate whether this was due to a failure of Krt5+ cells to expand in CoV2 infection compared to influenza infection12,13,14. We performed IF staining to compare the number of Krt5+ cells at 7, 14, and 21 DPI in CoV2 and Flu infected lungs (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 3). To monitor interstitial changes and fibrosis in consolidated lung regions, we co-stained for alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA) (Fig. 4a,b). Scattered Krt5 positive cells were found in Flu infected mice through 7–21 DPI, peaking at 14 DPI as defined by the highest percentage of proliferative Krt5+ cells and largest number of discrete Krt5+ pods (Fig. 4a–d and Supplementary Fig. 3). In striking contrast, we did not observe any Krt5+ “pods” or Krt5+ cells in consolidated areas in COVID lungs (Fig. 4a,c,d). Consolidated areas in Flu and COVID mouse lungs were shown to exhibit a mild increase in SMA expression by 14 DPI that resolves in Flu infected mice but persists at a low level by 21 DPI in CoV2-infected mice (Fig. 4a,b). We also found that Krt5+ cells express both transformation-related protein 63 (Trp63) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR), both pulmonary stem cell markers12,14,29,30 (Supplementary Figs. 4a,b, 5), which further confirms the airway stem cells. Moreover, we documented that Krt5+ “pod” structures contain dense AT1 cells identified by E-Cad staining, and scattered AT2 cells identified by pro-surfactant protein C (pro-SPC) (Supplementary Fig. 6). Together, these data show that Krt5+ progenitor cells proliferate in Flu-infected lung but are absent in areas of injury in CoV2 infected lung.Fig. 4: Krt5+ progenitor cell proliferation was induced in Flu infected K18 mice but not in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18 mice at 7, 14, and 21 DPI.a SMA-Krt5 double staining shows proliferation of Krt5+ cells in consolidated regions of Flu-infected lungs at 7 (n = 3), 14 (n = 4) and 21 DPI (n = 5). In SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs, consolidated pulmonary regions do not exhibit proliferation of Krt5+ cells (red) at 7 (n = 3), 14 (n = 3), or 21 DPI (n = 3).

To compare values obtained from two groups, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was performed. ** indicates p < 0.01. * indicates p < 0.05.Full size imageWe further used Picrosirius red (PSR) staining to investigate pulmonary collagen deposition between CoV2 and Flu infected lungs at different time points post infection (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 7). We observed that CoV2-infected mice tended to increase in collagen deposition in the lungs as compared to Flu infected mice at 21 DPI only, but not other time intervals (Fig. 5a,b). In contrast, the flu-infected lungs had minor collagen deposition across the disease time course. The dynamics of influenza-induced collagen deposition correlate with the disease progression and recovery. Viral load peaks usually around day 5 which is followed by severe inflammation and disease (weight loss) from days 7–10. Injury peaks from 10–18 DPI and resolves 20–30 DPI (Fig. 5a,b)6. Collagen deposition in CoV2-infected lungs was sustained at 7, 14, 21, and 45 DPI (Fig. 5a) and 45 DPI. Similar findings were observed with trichrome staining which showed that CoV2-infected mice had significantly higher collagen deposition in the lungs than Flu infected mice (Supplementary Fig. 1e,h and Supplementary Figs. 8, 9). Together, these results demonstrate that there is a sustained collagen deposition in CoV2 but not Flu infected lungs and support the notion that sub-lethal infection with CoV2 induces persistent fibrosis in the lungs of K18 mice at 21 DPI.Fig. 5: Collagen deposited in Flu mouse model and COVID mouse model.a Representative image of PSR stainings showing collagen deposition in lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18 mice (IN, 1 × 104 TCID50) at 7 (n = 3), 14 (n = 3), 21 (n = 3) and 45 DPI (n = 2) and Flu infected mice at 7 (n = 3), 14 (n = 4) and 21 DPI (n = 3) (50 PFU). b Quantification of collagen deposition in regions of consolidated and normal SARS-CoV-2-infected and Flu-infected lungs as detailed in Supplementary Fig. 7. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare collagen deposition level changes from 7 DPI to 21–45 DPI. One-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was performed to test the difference between two groups at one time point.Full size imageKrt5+ cell proliferation is absent in pulmonary consolidation area in CoV2 infected NHPs and human COVID-19 patientsWe validated our finding with necropsied lung samples from CoV2-infected NHPs (Supplementary Table 4), and three fatal human COVID patients (case summary shown in Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Fig. 10). We compared the COVID NHP lungs acutely infected with a different respiratory virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), to provide a comparator for Flu infected mouse model. Figure 6a shows that the acute RSV-infected NHPs at 7 DPI (left panel, n = 1) exhibited a strong Krt5 expression and cell proliferation in airways and in pulmonary parenchyma at site of consolidation with increased SMA expression. We previously reported that the CoV2-infected NHPs had typical COVID symptoms and pathological changes31. In acutely CoV2-infected NHPs between 14 and 30 DPI, Krt5 were only present in its normal niche within airways. We did not detect the proliferation of Krt5+ cells in regions of consolidation that displayed increased SMA expression within the pulmonary parenchyma (Fig. 6a, right panel, n = 4). Analysis of IF from three adult patients23 showed a similar lack of Krt5+ cell proliferation and “pod” structure as well (patients 1 shown in Fig. 6b; and patients 2 and 3 shown in Supplementary Fig. 11). Using both NHPs and human samples, we demonstrated a lack of a Krt5+ progenitor cells response following acute CoV2 infection.Fig. 6: No Krt5+ progenitor cells proliferate in CoV2-infected nonhuman primates or human patients.a Krt5+ progenitor cells (green) are normally identified in the basal layer of proximal conducting airways as seen in the SARS-CoV-2 infected NHP (top right). Following RSV infection in nonhuman primate (n = 1), there is proliferation of Krt5+ cells within airways and the adjacent pulmonary parenchyma which is not observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected nonhuman primates (n = 4). b Adult human COVID patient (patient 1) exhibits a similar reaction pattern to SARS-CoV-2 infected nonhuman primates with Krt5+ cells largely restricted to airways and rarely found within the pulmonary parenchyma.Full size imagescRNA-seq analysis of CoV2 and A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) infected K18 mice at 4 DPIWe further performed scRNA-seq analyses of flu-infected mice at an early phase of the infection (4 DPI). Pulmonary transcriptomic changes from Flu infection at the single-cell level were compared with those of CoV2 infection at 4 DPI, at the peak point of lung viral load when early pneumonia may appear15. The scRNA-seq analysis identified 10 distinct clusters of cells (Fig. 7a). We did not observe that Krt5 expression was increased in any of the identified 10 cell populations in CoV2 or Flu-infected mice in lungs at 4 DPI until 6 DPI (Supplementary Data 9). These results are consistent with the bulk RNA analysis of Flu and CoV2-infected mice at 4 and 6 DPI (Fig. 3a–d). The interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (Ifit1), 2 (Ifit2), 3 (Ifit3), and the interferon-inducible chemokine Cxcl10 were significantly upregulated in all eight cell populations of Flu-infected lungs compared to the CoV2 infected lungs (Fig. 7b–e). These findings confirm the results from bulk RNA analyses and further demonstrate that CoV2 infection induced down-regulation of the interferon response pathway on all pulmonary cells but not specific cell populations. We further investigated the impact of CoV2 and Flu infection on pulmonary epithelial cells specifically in the scRNA-seq data. Transcriptomic differences and pathway activation within the pulmonary epithelial cell cluster from Flu- and CoV2-infected mice were compared at 4 DPI. There were 105 up- and 744 down-regulated genes in flu-infected pulmonary epithelial cells compared to in CoV2 infection. We observed significant up-regulation of several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including Cxcl10, Ifit2, Gbp2, Rsad2, and Isg15 in Flu-infected lung epithelial cells compared to CoV2-infected cells (Fig. 8a and Supplementary Data 8). Both TNF receptor superfamily member 12 A (Tnfrsf12a), which may be involved in positive regulation of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway and regulation of wound healing32, and Serpinb9, which may be related to oxidation-reduction reactions33, were upregulated in influenza epithelial cells only and not observed in CoV2 infected mice (Fig. 8a and Supplementary Data 8). Among the down-regulated genes in Flu infected cells compared to CoV2, Sftpa1, Sftpb, Sftpc, and Sftpd, four surfactant proteins produced by type II pneumocytes34, and Scgb1a1, Scgb3a1, and Scgb3a2, three cytokine-like secretory proteins of small molecular weight secreted by lung epithelial cells that serve as biomarkers for lung injury35 were demonstrated in Flu-infected lungs. These down-regulated genes in Flu-infected lungs relative to CoV2 may reflect the extensive injury mediated by Flu infection. The interferon-gamma and alpha pathways, IL2-stat5 signaling pathway, apoptosis pathway, TNF α signaling via NFκB pathway, hypoxia pathway, UV response pathway, and P53 pathway were increased in the epithelial cells of Flu infected lungs compared to CoV2-infected lungs (Fig. 8b). These genes and pathways identified may contribute to the distinct lung injury and induced Krt5 progenitor cell proliferation between Flu and COVID infection-mediated lung.Fig. 7: scRNA-seq analysis of Flu-infected and SARS-CoV-2-infected lungs.a Major clusters and respective cell types for Flu and SARS-CoV-2 tissues at 4 DPI by scRNA-seq data.

K18 mice are on the B6 background and have been widely used to mimic acute severe COVID-19 for pathogenesis studies36,37 and preclinical measurements for assessing anti-COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. Our study demonstrates that infection of K18 mice with a sub-lethal concentration of CoV2 induces persistent pathology out to 45 DPI, consistent with long COVID. The mouse adapted CoV2 strain—MA10—has recently been shown to replicate in upper and lower airways of both young adult and aged mice and can model both acute and chronic COVID38. However, MA10 only causes evident COVID in BALB/c mice38, preventing the usage of many genetic tools available on C57BL/6 background mice. The golden hamster has also been utilized as a small animal model for long COVID, showing unique permanent injuries in lung and kidney39. However, limited genetic information and tools (specific biological reagents) preclude this model for extensive mechanistic study as well. Our findings demonstrate K18 mice on B6 background as a valid model to investigate pathogenesis of CoV2 and mechanisms of long COVID.The persistent, patchy lesions found in murine lung at 21 and 45 DPI appear to be independent of live virus, as we were unable to detect viral subgenomic RNA at these late timepoints. However, we did identify CoV2 spike protein in pulmonary macrophages. This data indicate that the CoV2 may be engulfed and cleared by pulmonary macrophages at 21 DPI. Previously, we found that infiltrating macrophages are the predominant cell population in response to CoV2 infection in K18 mice during the acute phase via scRNA seq analysis15. Dense infiltration of aberrantly activated monocyte-derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages have been described in inflamed lungs from severe COVID-19 patients40. Together, our data further highlight the important role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic COVID.We also documented that influenza induced significantly stronger inflammatory responses within 4 DPI compared to CoV2. One likely reason for this heightened inflammation during acute Flu infection is the stronger interferon response, as evidenced by the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) including Ifit1, Ifit2, Ifit3, and Cxcl10. These differences in interferon pathway induction may trace back to TLR3 and TLR7 sensitivity or other IFN stimulating and regulatory factor differences. It has also been shown that CoV2 spike protein directly suppresses interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a key transcriptional regulator of Type I interferons41 .The interferon response is the most extensive and immediate innate immune response during viral infections. While IFNs are induced during many viral infections42, their role during COVID has been somewhat controversial with conflicting findings. Initial reports in mice infected with CoV2 suggested IFN is a contributing factor to excessive inflammation43; however, administration of Type I IFNs reduced viral titers and improved recovery in a CoV2-infected animal model. It is important to note that IFN is only effective when administrated at early phase after infection44,45, and sustained Type I IFN levels have been associated with increased pulmonary injury and reduced epithelial cell proliferation42. Importantly, sustained IFN production has been verified in mild-to-moderate long COVID patients at 8 months after disease46. In our study, we also detected sustained IFN pathway activation at 21 DPI in the lungs of COVID mice. However, how the sustained IFN pathway activation contributes to persistent fibrosis, lack of induction of Krt5+ “pod” formation and cell proliferation in COV2-infected lung remains unclear and requires further investigation.Our bulk RNAseq findings demonstrated significant transcriptional differences between Flu and CoV2-infected mice. While a number of these genes were associated with inflammation, key differences in several keratin genes were also identified. Specifically, there was a significant induction of Krt5 following Flu infection, which is of particular interest as it is a marker for lung multipotent basal cells. Basal epithelial cells, locate on the basal side of pseudo-stratified epithelia47,48, have been characterized to expand and migrate from the conducting airways to injury sites during Flu infection12,49,50. While initially thought to replace dying epithelial cells, there is a growing consensus that basal cells act to prevent loss of structural integrity during injury51. Histologically, we demonstrated nascent progenitor cells formed “pod” structure in pulmonary parenchyma in Flu but not COV2-infected mice stained by Krt5, trp63, and NGFR. The Krt5+ “pods” mainly contain AT1 cells, which confirms the notion that nascent Krt5+ cells may contribute to repair following Flu-induced pulmonary injury. Unlike Flu, Krt5+ cells were not involved in the response following CoV2-induced pulmonary injury in mice, NHPs, and human lungs. Until now, there have been a very limited number of publications investigating basal cells and CoV2 infection. In a recent clinical study, Jyothula et al. tested the lungs collected from the COVID-19 patients who required transplantation due to the fulminant lung fibrosis52. The study identified a unique fibrotic gene signature in these patients dominated by a hyper-expression of pro-fibrotic genes and found an increase of Krt-5 expressing cells adjacent to fibroblastic areas and in apparent epithelial bronchiolization areas52. Of note, these patients suffered from non-resolvable lung fibrosis for at least two months. Most of these patients received steroids (dexamethasone) and remdesivir as well as being placed on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO prior to transplant. The multiple extensive clinical interventions, treatments, and prolonged COVID-19 disease course may have induced the Krt5+ cell proliferation observed in their study. In contrast, our study investigated the natural disease course COVID in the absence of clinical intervention in which we failed to detect Krt5+ proliferating cells in fibrotic areas in K18 mice, NHP, and human COVID samples within approximately one month of infection, a period that spans the transition from the acute to the chronic phase. It is conceivable that the inability for CoV2 to induce Krt5+ cells during the acute phase of disease may be a key factor for the protracted COVID injury outcomes.Interestingly, we also found that COV2-infected K18 mice had increased AT2 cell numbers compared to Flu-infected mice at 21 DPI (Supplementary Fig. 12). Another function of AT2 cells is to express pulmonary surfactants. Consistently, our sc RNA analysis documents that the up-regulation of surfactant genes such as Sftpa Sftpb, Sftpc, and Sftpd in the epithelial cells of COV2 infected K18 as compared to Flu-infected K18 mice at 4DPI (Fig. 8a). However, how AT2 cells, another group of stem cells in the lung53, contribute to repair of chronic COVID-mediated lung injury and normalization of lung function remains unclear. Nonetheless, our scRNA analysis in Flu and CoV2 infected lung identified key molecular and pathway activation differences in epithelial cells. The causative effect of these genes and pathways on Krt5+ “pod” induction and lung repair in viral infection-mediated chronic pulmonary injury remains elusive.Taken together, by comparing COVID-19 infection vs Influenza infection in K18 mice, we documented that 1) CoV2 infection but not Flu infection fails to induce Krt5+ “pod” formation and cell proliferation and 2) CoV2 infection mediates more profound chronic effects on the lungs including fibrotic abnormalities than flu infection. Our studies provide a new avenue for further identifying cellular and molecular differences in the repair process between COVID-19 and influenza. It is important to note that there are many differences between Flu and COV2 infections. Influenza is a segmented genome and induces a stronger IFN response, can replicate faster as compared to SARS-COV-2, and both viruses use different receptors to cause the diseases54,55,56,57. How those differences such as growth rates and the utilization of the different receptors influence the resolution of the inflammation and fibrotic abnormalities mediated by Influenza and SARS-COV-2 is unknown and warrants further investigation experimentally. The dissection of the questions requires the use of multiple approaches including in vitro cell culture system54, human organoid method58,59, our model reported here, other mouse-adapted SARS-CoV2 strains such as MA10 or MA30, and human Flu and COVID patient samples56,60,61.MethodsMiceK18+/−(034860) and C57BL/6J (B6) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and housed in an animal facility at Tulane University (detailed mice information are shown in Supplementary Table 1).Statistics and reproducibilityThe results presented depict the output of independent mice (n = 1–5). Infected mice were analyzed at multiple time intervals post-infection to minimize bias and increase reproducibility. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. To compare values obtained from multiple groups over time, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. To compare values obtained from two groups, the unpaired Student’s t-test was performed. Statistical significance was taken at the P < 0.05 level.Study approvalAll animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Tulane University and conducted under the Animal Use Protocols: 1331 and 1383. We have complied with all relevant ethical regulations for animal studying.SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infectionFor SARS-CoV-2, the USA-WA1/2020 isolate was used (NR-52281 strain deposited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH). We passaged the virus in VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells in DMEM media with 2% FBS and sequence verified to ensure homology with the original patient sequence. Mice were infected intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 (2 × 105 TCID50 for acute lethal dose infection or 1 × 104 TCID50 for sub-lethal dose infection) in an ABSL3 facility.For influenza (Flu) infection, mice were infected with H1N1 A/PR/8/34 (PR8)6,27,62. Briefly, a sublethal concentration (50PFU) was diluted in 50ul of sterile saline and mice were infected by oropharyngeal aspiration. Control, uninfected mice received sterile saline.Tissue processingABSL3 facility staff monitered the daily body weights. The mice were euthanized if the mice lose 20% body weight. Half lung (whole Right lung) was fixed inside Z-FIX buffer at RT. Half of the rest half lung (Left) were submerged in 1 mL Trizol and stored at −80 °C for RNA extraction. The remaining half of the rest half lung (Left) were frozen on dry ice with no media store at −80 °C as backup. Brain was collected 1/4 in flash freeze on dry ice with no media store at −80 °C,1/4 in 1 mL Trizol for RNA extraction, 1/2 in Z-fix for histological analysis.Histological analysis and quantification of histopathologic lesionsSections of the lung were processed routinely, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and digitally scanned with a Axio Scan.Z1(Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Images were captured using the Figure maker tool in HALO (Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM).RNA isolationTissues were collected in 1 mL Trizol reagent (15596026; Invitrogen) and extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (Cat. No.74104; QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The concentration of RNA was determined by NanoDrop 2000.Subgenomic N viral copy number detection100 ng total RNAs were mixed in Taqpath 1-Step Multiplex Master Mix (Cat. No. A15299; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) and FAM-labeled primers (sgm-N-FOR: 5′-CGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTC-3′, sgm-N-Probe:5′-FAM-TAACCAGAATGGAGAACGCAGTGGG-TAMRA-3′,sgm-N-reverse:5′-GGTGAACCAAGACGCAGTAT-3′), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Subgenomic N viral copy number was calculated by standard Cq values. The assay was performed under ABI QuantStudio 6 system (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).Bulk RNA sequencingIsolated lung tissue RNA was quantified using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Agilent 4150TapeStation (Santa Clara, CA) was used to obtain RNA integrity number and fragment sizes (DV200 metrics). Illumina NEBNext Ultra II directional RNA library prep kit (San Diego, CA) was used for library preparation. For cluster generation, the cDNA libraries were pooled at a final concentration of 1.8 pM. Illumina NextSeq 2000 P2 100 (San Diego, CA) was used with a minimum of 750 pM of RNA for sequencing. Gene expression and nucleotide variation were evaluated after processing and mapping the raw reads as previously described[54]. We normalized the raw read counts across all samples. Differential expression analysis was performed using Cuffdiff, EdgeR, and DESeq, (Slug Genomics, University of California, Santa Cruz). To generate volcano plots in R, the Cuffdiff output was considered. All curated datasets were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive BioProject number: GSE248778.Volcano plotR software v4.1.0 package EnhancedVolcano was used to generate volcano plots. The x-axis coordinate was log2 fold change and the y-axis coordinate was negative log10 p value.Over-enrichment analysisEnrichment analysis was performed with the R package version 4.1.0 software package ggplot2. Enrichment scores were calculated against the Hallmark (H) gene sets of the Molecular Signature database (MsigDB) database. Gene sets significantly enriched in the datasets (p < 0.05) were curated.Single-cell RNA sequencing and 10× assayLung will be minced with forceps and small scissors and digested in 2 mL serum-free medium with 2 mg/mL collagenase (MilliporeSigma) and 80 U/mL DNase I (MilliporeSigma) for 60 min at 37 °C15. 5000 live cells per sample were targeted by using 10× Single Cell RNAseq technology provided by 10× Genomics (10X Genomics)15. Full-length barcoded cDNAs were then generated and amplified by PCR to obtain sufficient mass for library construction15. Pooled libraries at a final concentration of 1.8 pM were sequenced with paired-end single index configuration by Illumina NextSeq 550. Cell Ranger version 2.1.1 (10X Genomics) was used to process raw sequencing data and Loupe Cell Browser (10X Genomics) to obtain differentially expressed genes between specified cell clusters15. In addition, Seurat suite version 2.2.1 was used for further quality control and downstream analysis15. Filtering was performed to remove multiplets and broken cells, and uninteresting sources of variation were regressed out. Variable genes were determined by iterative selection based on the dispersion versus average expression of the gene. For clustering, principal component (PC) analysis was performed for dimension reduction. The top 10 PCs will be selected by using a permutation-based test implemented in Seurat and passed to t-SNE for clustering visualization15.ImmunostainingZinc formalin-fixed (Z-fixed), paraffin-embedded lung was sectioned, deparaffinized, and subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval using both high-pH(Vector Labs H-3301, Olean, NY), and low-pH solutions (Vector Labs H-3300, Olean, NY). Sections were blocked with 10% goat serum or 1% donkey serum for 40 min at room temperature, incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and secondary antibodies for 60 min at room temperature. Slides were digitally scanned by Zeiss Axio scan. Z1. Detailed antibody information is shown in Supplemental Table 6. PSR staining and Trichrome staining were performed routinely by the histology core in TNPRC.Digital image analysis for the quantification of fluorescent marker expression and trichromeSmooth muscle actin (SMA) and Cytokeratin 5 (Krt5) were quantified using the Area Quantification Fl module v.2.1.10 in HALO v3.4 (Indica Labs, Albuquerque, NM). Sections of lung were stained with a panel of markers including DAPI, CK5, and SMA. Slides were imaged in 4 channels, including one empty channel (Far red) for the detection and subsequent exclusion of autofluorescent signal. A pathologist annotated regions of interest (ROI) for pulmonary lesions and adjacent regions of normal/unaffected lung. If multiple regions of pneumonia were present, those with the highest CK5 expression were chosen for quantitation. Thresholds for marker detection were set and checked for accuracy post analysis by the same pathologist. Each marker was quantified based on the percentage of area it was detected within each region (lesion or normal). Trichrome stain was quantified on the same ROI, using the same method but with Area Quantification v.2.2.4 module from HALO.Quantification of colocalization of CD206 and SARS-CoV-2 was performed using the HighPlex FL v4.1.3 module in HALO. Slides were stained with DAPI, CD206, and SARS-CoV-2 and imaged in four channels, including one empty channel for autofluorescence detection. Region of interest was drawn around the entire lung section. Thresholds for marker detection were set and checked for accuracy post analysis by the same pathologist.Trichrome and Picosirius red staining were quantified using deep learning, pattern recognition algorithms (HALO AI v3.4). Algorithms were trained by a pathologist to recognize collagen from both Trichrome and Picrosirius red stained slides. Regions of interest were drawn around regions of pulmonary consolidation and adjacent, similar, normal lung regions excluding anatomic regions that normally contain abundant collagen (large vessels and airways). Data was graphed as the difference in the percentage area of collagen in consolidated regions minus normal regions.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

I am also Head of the Influenza and Acute Respiratory Infections Risk Factors Laboratory of the Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza.My career as an influenza virologist began in 1963 when, after successfully graduating from the Leningrad Medical Institute, I was enrolled in a postgraduate course at the Virology Department of the Institute of Experimental Medicine. The head of the department was an outstanding scientist named Anatoly A. Smorodintsev who had isolated influenza viruses from patients in Leningrad between 1933 and 1936 and substantiated the possibility of attenuation, or altering the virus to make it harmless, to obtain a live influenza vaccine. Academician Anatoly A. SmorodintsevCredit: Anna SomininaIn 1967 I completed my Ph.D. dissertation entitled "Immunofluorescent control of the reproduction of myxo- and paramyxoviruses in cell cultures and the organism". The obtained FITC-conjugates proved to be useful in recognition of influenza cases and outbreaks during the 1968-1969 pandemic. Later the methods for their preparation were introduced into the experimental production of reagents in the newly organized All-Union Research Institute of Influenza of the Ministry of Health.In 1971, our Institute was recognized by WHO as a National Influenza Center, and since then we have been working on improving influenza surveillance through the introduction of new diagnostic methods, the extension of the geography of research, and developing epidemic baselines for incidence and hospitalization for the early detection of epidemics. Since 2010 we have introduced sentinel surveillance.Laboratory of biotechnology, All-Union Research Institute of Influenza, Leningrad, USSR, 1988Credit: Anna SomininaThe design and production of appropriate diagnostic reagents was performed in my laboratory using newly developed techniques to analyse the activity of 60 collaborating regional base laboratories (RBLs) on influenza surveillance and to conduct population immunity investigations. Since the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic rRT-PCR has been introduced widely in NICs and RBLs for influenza and ARI surveillance, as well for SARS-CoV-2 in the last two years. The Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza was recognized by WHO/Europe as a Reference Laboratory for SARS-CoV-2Credit: Anna SomininaThe close collaboration with WHO headquarters, the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO Europe) and WHO Collaboration Centres (CCs) for Reference and Research on Influenza in London and Atlanta contributed to the strengthening of influenza surveillance, the standardization of research, intensification of the work on virus isolation, antigenic characterization and early virus sharing with WHO CCs to select the strains for influenza vaccine composition.Training courses for virologists of Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia and Moldova in the Research Institute of Influenza with the participation of D. Pereyaslov from WHO/EuropeCredit: Anna SomininaThe significant progress of genetic research for influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 has been achieved in recent years in the Laboratory of Molecular Virology headed by Andrey Komissarov. They determined the pathways of SARS-CoV-2 introduction into Russia, identified numerous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 during long-term persistence of the virus in a patient with immunodeficiency, detected that virus in infected cats, and identified a new northwestern genetic variant (AT1). An important contribution to the antigenic characterization of influenza viruses was made by D.M. Danilenko as a result of cooperation with the WHO Collaborating Center in London and the introduction of the antigenic cartography method to visualize the antigenic relationships of influenza viruses circulating in the country and vaccine strains.Over the years, we have developed guidelines for influenza surveillance in the Russian Federation, and together with Oleg Kiselev, updated the National Plan for Influenza Pandemic Preparedness. In the past ten years, collaborating with US CDC and WHO/Europe, we have been paying great attention to the training of specialists from Eastern Europe with the great participation of the leading specialists of the NIC and support from WHO/Europe and WHO CCs.Ms Ann Moen gets acquainted with the conduct of laboratory research within the framework of sentinel surveillance in one of the base laboratories of the NICCredit: Anna SomininaIn conclusion, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Ann Moen,Wenqing Zhang, Caroline Brown, Dmitry Pereyaslov, Nancy Cox, Alexander Klimov, Alan Hay, John Wood and for cooperation, training of our specialists, advisory and comprehensive assistance since the early 1990s.Oleg Kiselev, Mikhail Eropkin and me during a visit to the WHO CC in London together with Alan Hay, John Mc Cauley, Rodney Daniels and Mikhail Matrosovich Credit: Anna SomininaFor achievements in the field of virology, I was awarded the title "Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation". This award was a tribute to all of our talented NIC team and our work in the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System with support from the Director of the Institute, Oleg Kiselev.Finally, I fully subscribe to the words of Robert Webster, an outstanding scientist and virologist deeply respected by me, that the GISRS network has served as a model of international collaboration, essential for understanding the evolution of influenza viruses on a global level and the ways of new pandemic strains emergence. It has been an honor for me to participate in GISRS and I am pleased to congratulate everyone on the celebration of the 70th Anniversary of activity and look forward to many more years to come.

This is possibly due to a delay in the autumn migration of several waterbird species A subdivision of the genus, a species is a group of closely related and similar-looking organisms; for example, in the case of Homo sapiens (humans), the second part of the name (sapiens) represents the species. As circulation of the virus among wild birds increases over the winter period, so too does the risk of outbreaks in poultry establishments. These are the findings of the the latest quarterly report on avian influenza by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the EU reference laboratory (EURL).Between 2 September and 1 December 2023, HPAI outbreaks were reported in domestic (88) and wild (175) birds across 23 European countries. The results are in line with trends forecasted by EFSA’s Bird Flu Radar, a tool providing weekly predictions of the probability The likelihood that a particular event will occur or that a measured value will fall within a particular range of HPAI introduction in wild birds.The report notes that seven out of the eleven variants (genotypes) of HPAI virus identified in Europe were new and affected different wild bird species, particularly common cranes. HPAI was detected in wild birds and mammals in the Antarctic region for the first time.ECDC assessed that the risk of infection with HPAI virus in Europe remains low for the general public, and low to moderate for occupationally or otherwise exposed people to infected birds or mammals (wild or domestic). To further reduce the risk of infection, experts recommend avoiding exposure Concentration or amount of a particular substance that is taken in by an individual, population or ecosystem in a specific frequency over a certain amount of time to dead or diseased seabirds or mammals.Today EFSA is publishing its Annual report on surveillance for avian influenza in poultry and wild birds, which summarises the results of surveillance activities carried out in Europe in 2022. EFSA has also launched a call for the establishment of an active surveillance network for HPAI across Europe.Links to scienceAvian influenza overview September–December 2023Annual report on surveillance for avian influenza in poultry and wild birds in Member States of the European Union in 2022How to contact usEFSA Media Relations OfficeTel. +39 0521 036 149E-mail: press [at] efsa.europa.eu (Press[at]efsa[dot]europa[dot]eu)(Only if you are a member of the press)Ask a Question ServiceYou have a question about EFSA’s work?

Research published Thursday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases finds that the flu virus may also have long-lasting effects on health. With the arrival of the pandemic and the resulting rash of long Covid cases, doctors had to rethink their ideas about viral infections, said senior study author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of research and development at the VA St. Louis Health Care System and a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis. “Our conception of these illnesses as acute events that you deal with and then put behind you has changed,” he said. “The acute phase is like the tip of an iceberg. People who get these infections may need attention beyond the acute phase. We need to ask if they have fully recovered, if they are able to go to the gym like before, if they have the same mental acuity.”This view of viral illnesses and their potential long-term impacts may lead to research that will also help people with other little understood conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, which experts believe might be triggered by viral infections, Al-Aly said.To take a closer look at the possible after-effects of Covid and the flu, Al-Aly and his colleagues turned to data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. They focused on records from 81,280 veterans who were hospitalized with Covid from March 2020 through June 2022, and 10,985 who were hospitalized with the flu from October 2015 through February 2019. Nearly all the patients in the study were men, and the average age was around 71 years old. In the 18 months after infection, both groups were at increased risk of death, hospital readmission, and health problems that involved a number of organs, including the heart, kidneys, brain and the digestive system. Covid patients were more likely to experience long-lasting problems with multiple organ systems at the same time, the study found. Flu patients also experienced this, but were more likely to have lasting symptoms related specifically to the lungs.Lung problems in people who had recovered from the flu could range from coughs that could persist for months to severe shortness of breath caused by inflammation and scarring deep in the lungs, Al-Aly said.Overall, the researchers found that illness caused by Covid was more severe, with higher rates of death, hospital readmission and adverse effects on multiple organ systems, than what was associated with the flu.One thing the researchers don’t know is how broadly applicable their findings are to the general population — for the most part, older men made up the patients in the study and all were sick enough to be hospitalized. “I think they would be applicable to people hospitalized with these conditions,” Al-Aly said. “What we don’t know is whether and to what extent this will apply to people with mild Covid and mild flu who do not require hospitalization.”Long Covid spotlighted the concept that viral illnesses could spark a long-lasting syndrome of symptoms, said Dr. Todd Rice, a professor of medicine in the division of allergy, pulmonary and critical care medicine and director of the medical intensive care unit at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.The new study underscores that “other viruses can have this long tail effect,” he said. “It shows that the flu can lead to a lot of pulmonary symptoms, such as post-viral cough that can last for months. In contrast, Covid can lead to a lot of nonpulmonary symptoms, including fatigue, muscle weakness and brain fog.”Doctors are seeing similar syndromes in patients infected with other respiratory viruses, Rice said. “Many have symptoms if they push themselves,” he added. “If they used to be able to run 5 miles, now they become short of breath and can only run 3.”Another study, published in October, found that symptoms can linger after a variety of common respiratory viruses, including common cold viruses, as well as influenza.Dr. Anita Gupta, an adjunct assistant professor of anesthesiology, critical care and pain medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, praised the new research. “I think it’s a very high-impact study that highlights the gravity of these conditions and the importance of preventing infection with these viruses,” she said.Currently there is no cure for these post-viral syndromes. That’s because “we really don’t understand how the viruses are triggering severe health problems and why they persist,” Gupta said. ”There’s a lot of research going on. I think we will figure it out.”Linda CarrollLinda Carroll is a regular health contributor to NBC News.

Back to Healio Key takeaways:Vaccines reduced the risk of having a health care visit for influenza by 35% to 44%. This effectiveness held across subgroups, including older adults who are at increased risk for influenza complications.Influenza vaccine efficacy during the 2022-2023 influenza season was “moderate” but still prevented many health care encounters and hospitalizations among adult patients, researchers determined.“Influenza viruses are constantly changing, and it’s important to understand how well vaccines work each year,” Mark W. Tenforde, MD, PhD, medical officer in CDC’s Influenza Division, told Healio. “This helps to inform vaccine policy and to communicate the benefits of vaccination to health care professionals and the public.” Tenforde MW, et al. J Infect Dis. 2023;doi:10.1093/infdis/jiad542. To provide an update on influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) during the most recent influenza season, Tenforde and colleagues used a test-negative design to evaluate the vaccine’s performance in preventing influenza-A-associated ED and urgent care (UC) visits and hospitalizations among adults between October 2022 and March 2023. VE was estimated by comparing odds of seasonal influenza vaccination among patients with influenza A and those who tested negative.In total, 85,389 ED/UC acute respiratory illness encounters — 17% of which were influenza A-positive, of whom 37.8% were vaccinated — and 19,751 hospitalizations — 9.5% of which were influenza A-positive, of whom 52.8% were vaccinated — were included in the study. The study showed that VE against influenza-A-associated ED/UC encounters was 44% overall (95% CI, 40%-47%), whereas VE against influenza A-associated hospitalizations was 35% (95% CI, 27%-43%) overall. When analyzed by age, VE was 45% among adults aged 18 to 64 years and 41% among those 65 years and older at preventing ED/UC encounters, and 23% and 41% at preventing hospitalizations among adults aged 18 to 64 years and 65 years and older, respectively.Based on these findings, Tenforde said that vaccines successfully reduced the risk of having a health care visit for influenza and remained effective across subgroups, including individuals at an increased risk for influenza complications such as older adults.“Millions of people in the U.S. get sick, and hundreds of thousands are hospitalized for influenza during a typical influenza season,” Tenforde said. “Even though they aren’t 100% effective, vaccines play a critical role in preventing illnesses and reducing the impact of influenza each year.” Published by: Sources/DisclosuresCollapse Source: Tenforde MW, et al.

Now, new research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System indicates that people hospitalized with seasonal influenza also can suffer long-term, negative health effects, especially involving their lungs and airways. The new study comparing the viruses that cause COVID-19 and the flu also revealed that in the 18 months after infection, patients hospitalized for either COVID-19 or seasonal influenza faced an increased risk of death, hospital readmission, and health problems in many organ systems. Further, the time of highest risk was 30 days or later after initial infection. The study illustrates the high toll of death and loss of health following hospitalization with either COVID-19 or seasonal influenza. It's critical to note that the health risks were higher after the first 30 days of infection. Many people think they're over COVID-19 or the flu after being discharged from the hospital. That may be true for some people. But our research shows that both viruses can cause long-haul illness." Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, senior author, clinical epidemiologist at Washington University The findings are published Dec. 14 in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The statistical analysis spanned up to 18 months post-infection and included a comparative evaluation of risks of death, hospital admissions and 94 adverse health outcomes involving the body's major organ systems. "A review of past studies on COVID-19 versus the flu focused on a short-term and narrow set of health outcomes," said Al-Aly, who treats patients within the VA St. Louis Health Care System and is an assistant professor of medicine at Washington University. "Our novel approach compared the long-term health effects of a vast array of conditions. Five years ago, it wouldn't have occurred to me to examine the possibility of a 'long flu.' A major lesson we learned from SARS-CoV-2 is that an infection that initially was thought to only cause brief illness also can lead to chronic disease. This revelation motivated us to look at long-term outcomes of COVID-19 versus flu. "We wanted to know whether and to what degree people with flu also experience long-term health effects," Al-Aly said. "The big answer is that both COVID-19 and the flu led to long-term health problems, and the big aha moment was the realization that the magnitude of long-term health loss eclipsed the problems that these patients endured in the early phase of the infection. Long COVID is much more of a health problem than COVID, and long flu is much more of a health problem than the flu." However, the overall risk and occurrence of death, hospital admissions, and loss of health in many organ systems are substantially higher among COVID-19 patients than among those who have had seasonal influenza, Al-Aly said. "The one notable exception is that the flu poses higher risks to the pulmonary system than COVID-19," he said. "This tells us the flu is truly more of a respiratory virus, like we've all thought for the past 100 years. By comparison, COVID-19 is more aggressive and indiscriminate in that it can attack the pulmonary system, but it can also strike any organ system and is more likely to cause fatal or severe conditions involving the heart, brain, kidneys and other organs." The researchers analyzed de-identified medical records in a database maintained by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the nation's largest integrated health-care delivery system. They evaluated information involving 81,280 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at some point from March 1, 2020, through June 30, 2022, as well as 10,985 patients hospitalized for seasonal influenza at some point from Oct. 1, 2015, through Feb. 28, 2019.

Regarding both viruses, patient vaccination status did not affect results. Those in the COVID-19 cohort were hospitalized during the pre-delta, delta and omicron eras. During the overall 18-month study period, patients who had COVID-19 faced a 50% higher risk of death than those with seasonal influenza. This corresponded to about eight more deaths per 100 persons in the COVID-19 group than among those with the flu. Although COVID-19 showed a greater risk of health loss than seasonal influenza, infection with either virus carried significant risk of disability and disease. The researchers found COVID-19 exhibited increased risk of 68% of health conditions examined across all organ systems (64 of the 94 adverse health outcomes studied), while the flu was associated with elevated risk of 6% of health conditions (six of the 94) – mostly in the respiratory system. Also, over 18 months, COVID-19 patients experienced an increased risk of hospital readmission as well as admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). For every 100 persons in each group, there were 20 more hospital admissions and nine more ICU admissions in COVID-19 than flu. "Our findings highlight the continued need to reduce the risk of hospitalization for these two viruses as a way to alleviate the overall burden of health loss in populations," Al-Aly said. "For both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza, vaccinations can help prevent severe disease and reduce the risk of hospitalizations and death. Optimizing vaccination uptake must remain a priority for governments and health systems everywhere. This is especially important for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and people who are immunocompromised." In both COVID-19 and the flu, more than half of death and disability occurred in the months after infection as opposed to the first 30 days, the latter of which is known as the acute phase. "The idea that COVID-19 or flu are just acute illnesses overlooks their larger long-term effects on human health," Al-Aly said. "Before the pandemic, we tended to belittle most viral infections by regarding them as somewhat inconsequential: 'You'll get sick and get over it in a few days.' But we're discovering that is not everyone's experience. Some people are ending up with serious long-term health issues. We need to wake up to this reality and stop trivializing viral infections and understand that they are major drivers of chronic diseases."

The study, carried out by the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, compared Flublok with standard-dose flu vaccine that is made using chicken eggs. Amber Hsiao, PhD, MPH The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on December 13. The researchers randomized a total of 2.4 million Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) patients ages 18-64 to receive either the higher-dose recombinant vaccine or the standard-dose egg-based vaccine during the 2018 to 2021 influenza seasons. However, data from the third season — 2020-2021 — was ultimately excluded from the analysis because there was virtually no flu circulating that year, in part because of the COVID-19 pandemic. That left 1.6 million patients in the analysis. Among the older patients ages 50 to 64, those who received the recombinant vaccine were 15.3% less likely to have a lab-confirmed case of flu than those who received the standard-dose vaccine (known as quadrivalent standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine). There was not a significant difference in which patients had a flu-related hospitalization, likely because there were relatively few hospitalized patients to analyze. “This large study adds to what we know about relative effectiveness of flu vaccines, which are given to millions of Americans each year, and on which we rely to reduce illness and hospitalization, particularly among vulnerable groups,” said lead author Amber Hsiao, PhD, MPH, project manager with the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research. Flublok has a higher dose of flu antigen than the standard-dose, quadrivalent vaccine. The results from the 2 flu seasons analyzed suggest Flublok’s better protection is more likely related to its higher dose of flu antigen than to manufacturing differences, Hsiao said. Nicola Klein, MD, PhD The study compared the relative effectiveness of the 2 vaccines against one another, but did not estimate how effective each was against flu when compared with people who were not vaccinated. In the older group ages 50 to 64, the analysis found 2 patients per 1,000 tested positive for flu after receiving Flublok, while 2.34 patients per 1,000 tested positive after receiving the standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine. Strengths of the study included the large number of patients and the novel randomized design, said senior author Nicola Klein, MD, PhD, director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center. All KPNC facilities provided one of 2 flu vaccines alternately each week of the flu season. Which vaccine patients received depended upon which facility and week they sought vaccination. The researchers then looked for patients who tested positive for flu and for flu-related hospitalizations. Varying effectiveness Influenza causes mild to severe illness in 9 million to 41 million people each year in the U.S. Vaccines vary in their effectiveness year to year, depending on whether public health officials have chosen strains of influenza virus that match what eventually circulates in the population during flu season. Effectiveness can vary from 20% to 60%, Klein said. “It is clear that research into more consistently effective flu vaccines is needed,” she said. “This is one of the main areas of work for our Vaccine Study Center.” Flu seasons have been unusual the past few years because of the COVID-19 pandemic; restrictions on public interactions greatly reduced the transmission of flu virus. This study examined the 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 winter flu seasons in the U.S., which included 1.6 million of the total 2.4 million vaccinated at KPNC, when case numbers were more typical. The study’s unique real-world randomization. The study did not include patients 65 and older because most were receiving a third type of vaccine called Fluzone High-Dose, which is also a high-dose flu vaccine and uses the chicken egg method. Last flu season (starting in August 2022), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that older adults receive a high-dose (Fluzone High-Dose or Flublok) or adjuvanted flu vaccine (Fluad). The study was funded by Sanofi. Other co-authors were Arnold Yee, MBA, Bruce Fireman, MA, John Hansen, MPH, and Ned Lewis, MPH, all of the Vaccine Study Center. # # # About the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research The Kaiser Permanente Division of Research conducts, publishes and disseminates epidemiologic and health services research to improve the health and medical care of Kaiser Permanente members and society at large.

(Arkansas Democrat-Gazette file photo) Reports of H5N1 avian influenza in Arkansas so far in December are higher than in any other month this year.Biologists conducting aerial surveys for waterfowl population estimates last week found a few small groups of dead geese in Lonoke, Arkansas and Craighead counties that later tested positive for the virus, according to an Arkansas Game and Fish Commission news release this week.Additional suspected cases have been found in Pulaski, Faulkner, Clay, Poinsett and Prairie counties, the release noted.The commission employs four biologists to conduct aerial waterfowl surveys three times per year: in early December, early January and mid-January, which is when large numbers of waterfowl are in the state, Waterfowl Program Coordinator Brett Leach said.The surveys are not designed to monitor for avian influenza, though biologists will note areas with dead birds to keep track of where disease outbreaks may be occurring, Leach said."The majority of reports of sick and dead birds come from the public and from what we are seeing on the ground," Leach said.Reports of sick and dead birds are lower this fall compared to fall 2022, Leach said."Biologists picking up samples for testing reported far fewer dead waterfowl than what they were seeing last year. Majority of reports are from light geese (lesser snow and Ross's) and a few greater-white fronted geese."Leach noted there are always various low pathogenicity strains of influenza circulating in wild birds, and the strain the commission is reporting is in its "confirmed or suspected cases of high path avian influenza."University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture Extension Poultry Veterinarian Dustan Clark said in October that there could be increased potential for exposure to the virus due to the fall migration of wild waterfowl.There have been 23 official reports of avian influenza in wild birds in Arkansas so far in 2023, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture APHIS avian influenza tracker.In terms of commercial and backyard flocks, there have been three reported cases affecting 142,470 birds so far in December in Arkansas; the most recent case reported was in Scott County among 170 birds on Dec. 14.There was one case reported in Arkansas in November, which affected 81,200 birds at a commercial broiler breeder operation in Carroll County.There was only one case in October, and it was also the first case of the virus in Arkansas this year, reported among 31,600 broiler breeder pullets in Madison County on Halloween.The Arkansas Department of Agriculture has said the virus does not pose a public health threat and does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat.There have been 255,270 birds affected by the virus in Arkansas so far in 2023, mostly among commercial broiler operations.Arkansas had three reported outbreaks of avian influenza in 2022 that affected 56,490 birds in Madison, Pope and Arkansas counties.The public can submit reports of concentrations of sick or dead birds at www.agfc.com/education/avian-influenza/.

Opens in a new tab or window email article In patients hospitalized for either COVID-19 or seasonal influenza, rates of death, negative effects on long-term health, and hospital readmissions were high, but less so for the flu patients, a comparative analysis showed. Over 18 months of follow-up, patients hospitalized with COVID had an increased risk of death compared with those hospitalized for influenza (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.45-1.58), translating into an excess death rate of 8.62 per 100 persons, reported Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, of the VA St. Louis Health Care System and Washington University in St. Louis, and colleagues in Lancet Infectious Diseases. In addition, COVID was associated with a significantly increased risk of 64 of 94 prespecified health outcomes, including cardiovascular outcomes, coagulation and hematological outcomes, fatigue, gastrointestinal outcomes, kidney outcomes, mental health outcomes, metabolic outcomes, musculoskeletal outcomes, neurological outcomes, and pulmonary outcomes. Meanwhile, seasonal influenza was associated with increased risk of six outcomes compared with COVID: angina, tachycardia, type 1 diabetes, and three of four prespecified pulmonary outcomes (cough, hypoxemia, and shortness of breath). The cumulative rates of adverse health outcomes across all organ systems were 615.18 per 100 persons in the COVID group and 536.90 per 100 persons in the influenza group, corresponding to an excess rate of 78.72 (95% CI 66.15-91.24) per 100 persons in the COVID group. "Five years ago, it wouldn't have occurred to me to examine the possibility of a 'long flu,'" Al-Aly said in a press release. "A major lesson we learned from SARS-CoV-2 is that an infection that initially was thought to only cause brief illness also can lead to chronic disease." Al-Aly and team also found that patients who had been hospitalized for COVID were at increased risks for hospital readmission and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) during 18-month follow-up. In the COVID cohort, there were approximately 21 more hospital admissions (95% CI 16.10-24.86) and nine more ICU admissions (95% CI 6.68-11.82) per 100 persons compared with the influenza cohort. The numbers of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) across all organ systems were 287.43 per 100 persons in the COVID group and 242.66 per 100 persons in the seasonal influenza group, translating to 45.03 (95% CI 37.15-52.90) higher DALYs per 100 persons in the COVID group. "The main 'aha' moment for me was the realization that the toll of disease and disability is larger in the post-acute phase than the acute phase of illness," Al-Aly told MedPage Today. "This is true for both COVID and the flu." Although both COVID and influenza pose potentially serious threats to long-term health, COVID remains a much more formidable threat, Al-Aly said. "COVID is really a multi-systemic disease, whereas, relatively speaking, flu is more respiratory," he noted. "We ought to take these illnesses seriously and do our best to make sure that people are protected through vaccination. Conceptualizing these illnesses as acute events -- as we often do -- ignores the much larger toll of disease and disability that emanates from the long phase of illness." The study authors analyzed data from the healthcare databases of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and included 81,280 patients admitted to the hospital for COVID from March 1, 2020 to June 30, 2022 and 10,985 patients admitted for influenza from Oct. 1, 2015 to Feb. 28, 2019. Mean age was 71, 94.9% were men, and 73.9% were white. Because the study evaluated risks of post-acute sequelae in people who required hospitalization for influenza or COVID, the results of the study cannot be extrapolated to those with milder infection, Al-Aly and team wrote. Moreover, the study population was comprised predominantly of older white men and may not represent the general population admitted to the hospital for influenza or COVID.

Here's where the highest rates are.Diana Leyva Nashville TennesseanAccording to a nationwide influenza surveillance report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tennessee is among seven states reporting "high" flu-like symptoms for the 2023-2024 season.According to the Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report, Tennessee, California, New Mexico, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and New York are the states with "high" reports. Louisiana and South Carolina had "very high" reports.Th report, which was updated on Dec. 8, examines data from hospitals reporting the number of patients seen for influenza-like illnesses. There have been a total of 12 influenza related deaths reported by the CDC.Read ahead for more information from the report and the Tennessee Department of Health.Flu findings from the Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance ReportSeasonal flu activity continues to increase in most parts of the country, with the southeast and south-central areas of the country reporting the highest levels of activity.Four influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during Week 48 (Nov. 26-Dec.2), bringing the 2023-2024 season total to 12 pediatric deaths.The CDC estimates that there have been at least 2.6 million illnesses, 26,000 hospitalizations, and 1,600 deaths from flu so far this season.The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine, as there are still vaccines available and that now is still a good time to get vaccinated if you haven’t already.Where are the highest flu rates in Tennessee?According to the Tennessee Department of Health, Tennessee has had a minimal and moderate percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness during its 48th week.There have been no deaths reported during this time.The counties with the highest rates are Memphis/Shelby (6.6%), Jackson/Madison County Metro (5.7%), the Northeast Region (5.7%), Chattanooga/Hamilton (5.6%), and Nashville/Davidson County (5.3%).Total cases per region in Tennessee:Chattanooga/Hamilton County Metro: 5.6%East Region: 5.0%Jackson/Madison County Metro: 5.7%Knox County Metro: 2.3%Memphis/Shelby County Metro: 6.6%Mid Cumberland Region: 3.2%Nashville/Davidson County Metro: 5.3%Northeast Region: 5.7%Southeast Region: 4.8%South Central Region: 0.0%Sullivan County Metro: 4.5%Upper Cumberland Region: 0.6%West Region: 0.8%Diana Leyva covers trending news and service for The Tennessean.

Chaves3,4 Show authors Scientific Reports volume 13, Article number: 22342 (2023) Cite this article 1576 Accesses 15 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Evolutionary geneticsPhylogenetics AbstractInfluenza viruses undergo rapid evolutionary changes, which requires continuous surveillance to monitor for genetic and potential antigenic changes in circulating viruses that can guide control and prevention decision making. We sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed A(H1N1)pdm09 virus genome sequences obtained from specimens collected from hospitalized patients of all ages with or without pneumonia between 2009 and 2018 from seven sentinel surveillance sites across Kenya. We compared these sequences with recommended vaccine strains during the study period to infer genetic and potential antigenic changes in circulating viruses and associations of clinical outcome. We generated and analyzed a total of 383 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus genome sequences. Phylogenetic analyses of HA protein revealed that multiple genetic groups (clades, subclades, and subgroups) of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulated in Kenya over the study period; these evolved away from their vaccine strain, forming clades 7 and 6, subclades 6C, 6B, and 6B.1, and subgroups 6B.1A and 6B.1A1 through acquisition of additional substitutions. Several amino acid substitutions among circulating viruses were associated with continued evolution of the viruses, especially in antigenic epitopes and receptor binding sites (RBS) of circulating viruses. Disease severity declined with an increase in age among children aged < 5 years. Our study highlights the necessity of timely genomic surveillance to monitor the evolutionary changes of influenza viruses. Routine influenza surveillance with broad geographic representation and whole genome sequencing capacity to inform on prioritization of antigenic analysis and the severity of circulating strains are critical to improved selection of influenza strains for inclusion in vaccines.

A(H1N1)pdm09 virus displaced seasonal A(H1N1) virus and has continued to circulate in subsequent years alongside influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses globally4,5,6, causing annual seasonal epidemics7,8,9. The rapid ability of the virus to spread globally upon its emergence highlights the public health threat posed by emergent viruses3,10,11. The countrywide surveillance for influenza viruses among medically-attended patients in Kenya since the emergence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strain allows for exploring the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the virus7,12,13.We characterized the genetic and antigenic evolution in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating in Kenya between 2009 and 2018 using codon-complete gene sequences generated through next-generation sequencing (NGS). We then utilized genetic sequence data and available clinical information to investigate associations of clinical outcome among hospitalized children aged < 5 years.Materials and methodsStudy designSamples analyzed in this study were collected between June 2009 and December 2018 through two health facility-based surveillance systems in Kenya as detailed previously13. The first involved continuous countrywide surveillance for influenza through severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) sentinel hospital reporting undertaken at six sites supported by the US Centers for Disease Control-Kenya (CDC-Kenya) country office: Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), Nakuru County and Referral Hospital (CRH), Nyeri CRH, Kakamega CRH, Siaya CRH, and Coast General Teaching and Referral Hospital in Mombasa7,8,13,14,15,16. The second was the pediatric viral pneumonia surveillance undertaken at Kilifi County Hospital (KCH)12.In the CDC-Kenya supported surveillance sites, SARI was defined as acute onset of illness (within the last 14 days) among hospitalized patients of all ages with cough and reported fever (feeling feverish) or a recorded temperature of ≥ 38 °C. Furthermore, among hospitalized children aged < 5 years, additional clinical information including difficulty in breathing, lower chest wall indrawing, inability to drink or breastfeed, and nasal flaring were recorded. Chart review was done at the time of discharge or death to collect clinical outcome data. In the second facility-based surveillance undertaken at KCH from January 2009 through December 2018, a definition of pediatric viral pneumonia among children aged 1 day to 59 months presenting with syndromic severe or very severe pneumonia was used. A history of cough for < 30 days or difficulty breathing, when accompanied by lower chest wall indrawing was defined as severe pneumonia; a history of cough for < 30 days or difficulty breathing, when accompanied by any one of prostration (including inability to feed or drink), coma, or hypoxemia (oxygen saturation < 90%) was defined as very severe pneumonia7,16. Demographics, underlying diseases, and signs and symptoms were collected from patients who met the case definition; the patients were also assessed by study clinicians on physical and clinical findings.We selected a total of 418 (31.9%) A(H1N1)pdm09 virus positive SARI samples for this analysis based on real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) of < 35.0, adequate sample volume for RNA extraction (> 140 μL), and balanced distribution of samples based on surveillance sites and years. We also identified a total of 157 IAV positive specimens from the KCH surveillance site. These were not previously subtyped for influenza A virus subtypes. Therefore, we utilized all these specimens in the current analysis. Details on sample collection, storage and processing are available in our previous work13.RNA extraction and multi-segment real-time PCR (M-RTPCR) for IAVWe performed viral nucleic acid extraction from IAV and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus positive samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). We then reverse transcribed the extracted RNA, and amplified the complete coding region of IAV genome in a single M-RTPCR using the Uni/Inf primer set17. We evaluated successful amplification by running the products on 2% agarose gel and visualized the reaction on a UV transilluminator after staining with RedSafe Nucleic Acid Staining solution (iNtRON Biotechnology Inc.).IAV NGS and virus genome assemblyFollowing PCR, we purified the amplicons with 1X AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA), quantified amplicons with Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA, USA), and normalized amplicons to 0.2 ng/μL. We generated indexed paired-end libraries from 2.5 μL of 0.2 ng/μL amplicon pool using Nextera XT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. We then purified amplified libraries using 0.8X AMPure XP beads, quantitated libraries using Quant-iT dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA, USA), and evaluated libraries for fragment size in the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer System using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). We diluted the libraries to 2 nM in preparation for pooling and denaturation for running on the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). We the NaOH denatured pooled libraries, diluted to 12.5 pM, and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq using 2 × 250 bp paired end reads with the MiSeq v2 500 cycle kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). We added five percent Phi-X (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) spike-in to the libraries to increase library diversity by creating a more diverse set of library clusters. We carried out contiguous (contigs) nucleotide sequence assembly from the sequence data using the FLU module of the Iterative Refinement Meta-Assembler (IRMA) using IRMA default settings. We deposited all the generated sequence data in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database using the accession numbers OR873656–OR874038, OR874040–OR874805, and OR874852–OR875234.Phylogenetic clustering and genetic group classificationWe aligned and translated consensus nucleotide sequences for all gene segments in AliView version 1.26 (https://ormbunkar.se/aliview/). Were then reconstructed Maximum-likelihood (ML) trees for the individual gene segments using IQ-TREE version 2.0.7 (http://www.iqtree.org/). The software initiates tree reconstruction after assessment and selection of the best model of nucleotide substitution for alignment. We linked the ML trees to various metadata and visualized using R ggtree version 2.4.2 in R programming software v4.0.2 (http://www.rstudio.com/). We used the codon-complete hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of all viruses to characterize A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains into genetic groups (i.e., clades, subclades, and subgroups) using Phylogenetic Clustering using Linear Integer Programming (PhyCLIP) v2.0 (https://github.com/alvinxhan/PhyCLIP). We downloaded vaccine strains and reference viruses from GISAID EpiFluTM database (https://platform.gisaid.org/epi3/cfrontend). We aligned and reconstructed ML trees using vaccine strains, reference viruses, and translated Kenyan A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.Genetic characterization of amino acid substitutions in surface glycoproteins, matrix, and non-structural proteinsWe aligned the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins, matrix (M2), and non-structural 1 (NS1) gene segments of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus from this study using MAFFT version 7.475 (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/). We identified the amino acid substitutions in the antigenic epitopes (Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2 and Cb)18, receptor binding sites (RBS), and potential glycosylation sites of HA1 subunit of HA protein and substitutions in the codon-complete HA, NA, M2, and NS1 protein sequences of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses using Flusurver (https://flusurver.bii.a-star.edu.sg; accessed on June 01, 2021). We generated highlighter plots of Kenyan and reference sequences (obtained from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiFlu™ database—https://platform.gisaid.org/epi3/cfrontend) using inhouse python scripts to visualize amino acid differences in M2 and NS1 protein sequences among the sampled viruses.Predictors of severe infection among hospitalized children aged < 5 yearsWe used multivariable logistic regression in Stata version 16 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA) to investigate the predictors of severe infection among hospitalized patients. Only samples collected from hospitalized children aged < 5 years from CDC-Kenya and KCH surveillance were used to estimate the predictors of severe infection. Children hospitalized with fever and acute cough were categorized as severe if they had breathing difficulty and/or lower chest wall indrawing, or otherwise non-severe. The predictors investigated included patient age (categorized as < 12 months, 12–23 months, and ≥ 24 months), location of surveillance sites, year of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus sampling (pandemic period, 2009–2010; post pandemic period, 2011 onwards), A(H1N1)pdm09 virus genetic group, antigenic epitope substitutions, NS1 protein substitutions, and Ct values as proxy for viral load distributed in tertiles.ResultsIAV sequencing and genome assemblyWe generated and analyzed a total of 383 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus genome sequences. Among 418 A(H1N1)pdm09 virus positive samples from the CDC-Kenya surveillance system, 414 (99.1%) passed pre-sequencing quality control checks, which generated 344 (83.1%) codon-complete A(H1N1)pdm09 virus genome sequences on the MiSeq. Of the 157 IAV positive specimens available from KCH, 94 (59.9%) passed pre-sequencing quality control checks generating 45 (47.9%) A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (39 codon-complete and 6 partial) and 49 (52.1%) A(H3N2) virus genome sequences (46 codon-complete and 3 partial). For this report, only the 39 codon-complete A(H1N1)pdm09 virus sequences were included in the analyses. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of these patients are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients in severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and viral pneumonia surveillances in Kenya, 2009–18.Full size tableCirculation of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains in Kenya and their patterns of antigenic driftPhylogenetic analyses revealed that multiple genetic groups of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulated in Kenya over the study period and evolved away from their vaccine strain (Fig. 1). All Kenyan viruses from 2009–2018 evolved away from the vaccine strains A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09)-like virus and A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1pdm09)-like virus. The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains from 2009 to 2016 (n = 324; 84.6%) diverged from the 2009–2017 Northern Hemisphere (NH) and 2009–2016 Southern Hemisphere (SH) vaccine strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09)-like virus and fell into clade 7 (n = 97, 25.3%), clade 6 (n = 132, 34.5%), subclade 6C (n = 10, 2.6%), subclade 6B (n = 47, 12.3%), and subclade 6B.1 (n = 38, 9.9%), respectively. All the viruses from 2018 diverged from the 2017–2018 NH and 2017 SH vaccine strain A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1pdm09)-like virus and fell into subgroup 6B.1A (n = 57, 14.9%) and subgroup 6B.1A1 (n = 2, 0.5%), respectively.Figure 1Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus HA gene sequences from Kenya collected between 2009 and 2018, A(H1N1)pdm09 virus vaccine strains, and reference viruses. This is a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree with time shown on the x-axis. Branches are colored based on Kenyan, vaccine, and reference strains as shown in the color key. Amino acid substitutions in HA1 and HA2 subunits, which define A(H1N1)pdm09 virus genetic groups are also shown (HA2 substitutions are labelled in purple as shown in the color key).Full size imageClades 6 and 7 viruses co-circulated in Kenya between 2009 and 2012, with clade 6 viruses carrying HA substitutions D97N, S185T, and S203T, while clade 7 viruses carried HA substitutions D97, S185 and S203T (Fig. 1). Clade 6 viruses evolved into subclades 6A, 6B, and 6C; 6C carrying HA substitution V234I circulated in Kenya in 2013–2014, while 6B with HA substitutions K163Q, A256T, and K283E circulated in Kenya in 2014–2016. Subclade 6B evolved further into subgroup 6B.1 carrying additional HA substitution S84N, which dominated in 2015–2016. Subgroup 6B.1 further evolved into subgroups 6B.1A and 6B.1A1, carrying HA substitutions S74R, S164T, and I295V, which dominated in 2018.Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the viruses identified in hospitalized patients relative to the vaccine strains from which all the 2009–2018 strains considerably evolved revealed significant amino acid substitutions in antigenic epitopes and RBS among the circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains (Table 2). There were 13 amino acid substitutions across the five antigenic sites among sampled Kenyan viruses. Ranking from the most variable site, Sa, Ca2, Sb, Ca1, and Cb had two, six, six, three, and one substitution, respectively. The most frequent HA substitution per site for Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2 and Cb was K163Q, S185T, S203T, A141E, and S74R, respectively. HA substitutions S203T and S185T were the most dominant substitutions occurring in 100% and 59.3% (227/383) of viruses from 2009 to 2018, respectively. In addition, we observed previously described HA substitutions at the RBS (A186T and D222E) and glycosylation sites (A186T and N125S) of the viruses.Table 2 Antigenic drift among A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains collected from Kenya, 2009–2018.Full size tableGenetic and antigenic characterization of NA, M2, and NS1 proteinsAll NA proteins lacked the H275Y marker associated with resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. However, seven (1.8%) NA proteins had substitutions T362I (3), I117M (3), and V234I (1). Additionally, all the Kenyan viruses contained the amantadine-resistance marker S31N (Fig. S1). All 59 viruses from 2018 had six amino acid substitutions (E55K, L90I, I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S) in NS1 protein (Fig. S2).Predictors of severe infection among hospitalized children aged < 5 yearsWe observed that severity of infection declined with increase in age. Children aged ≥ 24 months were less likely to have severe infection compared to children aged 0–11 months (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11–0.54) and that A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses of genetic group 6B and 7 were less likely associated with severe infection compared to genetic group 6 viruses (aOR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09–0.72) and (aOR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15–0.79), respectively (Table 3), the small sample size possibly a limitation thus the wide CI values. Ct value, year of sampling, location of sampling, antigenic epitope substitutions, and NS1 protein substitutions were not associated with severe infection.Table 3 Predictors of severe infection among hospitalized children aged < 5 years.Full size tableDiscussionWe observed that A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating in Kenya from 2009 to 2018 evolved away from their corresponding vaccine strain over the study period. Kenyan virus strains from 2009 to 2016 evolved away from the 2009 to 2017 NH and 2009 to 2016 SH vaccine strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1pdm09)-like virus and fell into clades 7 and 6, and subclades 6C, 6B, and 6B.1. All viruses from 2018 evolved away from the 2017–2018 NH and 2017 SH vaccine strain A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1pdm09)-like virus and fell into subgroups 6B.1A and 6B.1A1. We identified considerable amino acid substitutions in antigenic epitopes and RBS among the circulating viruses, which confirms the continued evolution of circulating influenza viruses in Kenya. We recently reported that the evolutionary dynamics of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Kenya was associated with multiple virus introductions between 2009 and 2018, although only a few of those introductions instigated local seasonal epidemics, which then established local transmission clusters across the country13. We also observed substitutions in NA protein, which have been associated with reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors in vitro19, substitutions in M2 protein associated with adamantine-resistance, and substitutions in NS1 protein that possibly result in increased virulence20. Nonetheless, we were not able to associate viral genetic changes and substitutions with increased severity.Analysis of virus sequence data from Kenya during the pandemic in 2009 identified the introduction of clades 2 and 7 viruses into Kenya21. We recently reported that clades 6 and 7 viruses were introduced into Kenya, disseminated countrywide, and persisted across multiple epidemics as local transmission clusters13. Another recent study from Kenya reported the circulation of clade 6B, subclade 6B.1, and subclade 6B.2 viruses in the 2015–2018 influenza seasons22. Here, through detailed genomic analysis, we extend these observations and show that multiple influenza strains were introduced into Kenya and spread countrywide over the study period. Most of the amino acid substitutions associated with the continued evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Kenya have also been reported in other studies in Africa22,23,24,25 and Asia26,27. Therefore, the continuing local evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Kenya is in part due to the global circulation of influenza viruses.The genetic diversity of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in specific regions arising from multiple virus introductions and subsequent establishment of local transmission clusters13 composed of viruses harboring considerable amino acid substitutions in antigenic epitopes and RBS could lead to predominance of circulating viruses that might escape population immunity elicited by previously circulating viruses or to previously selected vaccine strains as shown in our study. In countries like Kenya, where influenza virus spread is year-round9, there also exists unpredictability of which genetic virus strain may predominate and when. Influenza vaccines that protect against a broad range of antigenically divergent strains (“universal” vaccines) could be key to managing the influenza disease burden in such settings. Currently, Kenya does not have a national influenza vaccination policy28, but it would be important to consider deployment of influenza vaccines with representative A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, A(H3N2) virus, and influenza B virus for optimal vaccine effectiveness13,29,30. It will also be important to investigate further whether the use of SH or NH formulated vaccines could have a place in tropical regions like in Kenya, where virus importations from both hemispheres are common.Specific influenza virus gene segment phylogenies and genetic group memberships have been associated with disease severity31. Although we did not observe associations between genetic group membership or substitutions with disease severity, these findings underscore the importance of reporting genetic surveillance data along with epidemiological data to allow for analysis of factors that may increase risk of influenza and impact disease severity32. Although we did not observe association between viral load and disease severity, larger studies have reported this association among hospitalized patients with pneumonia infection33, which underscores the need for multi-site studies with improved statistical power to estimate associations. We reported a reduction in disease severity with increase in age in children aged < 5 years, which corroborates the evidence that children aged < 6 months may experience more severe influenza related complications34.The study had some limitations. First, the analysis in this report only involved the HA, NA, M2, and NS1 gene segments of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Although these regions are important in understanding antigenic drift and antiviral drug resistance in influenza viruses, important changes in other gene segments, for example, mutations associated with increased pathogenicity may not have been captured. Secondly, the prioritized samples were selected based on anticipated probability of successful sequencing inferred from the sample’s viral load as indicated by the diagnosis Ct value. Such a strategy ultimately excluded NGS of some samples that may have been critical in inferring additional genetic characteristics of circulating influenza viruses. Lastly, the analysis in this report did not include phenotypic analyses to assess the effect of observed substitutions on virulence, pathogenicity, and transmissibility of influenza viruses.In conclusion, our study highlights the necessity of timely genomic surveillance to monitor the evolutionary changes of influenza viruses within a country and the necessity of combined genetic and epidemiological data to improve understanding of influenza season severity and guide intervention. Routine influenza surveillance with broad geographic representation and whole genome sequencing capacity to inform on prioritization of antigenic analysis and the severity of circulating strains are critical to improved selection of influenza strains for inclusion in vaccines.

The new COVID variant JN.1 is making up an increasing share of cases, the CDC's tracking shows."COVID-19 hospitalizations are rising quickly," the agency said in its weekly update. "Since the summer, public health officials have been tracking a rise in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which is caused by COVID-19. Influenza activity is growing in most parts of the country. RSV activity remains high in many areas." The CDC has been urging people to get vaccinated as the peak of this year's mix of three seasonal respiratory viruses — influenza, COVID-19 and RSV — is nearing. In pediatric hospitals, the CDC says beds "are already nearly as full as they were this time last year" in some parts of the country. Data from emergency rooms published Wednesday tracked emergency room visits nearly doubling in school-age children last week.The increase, driven largely by an acceleration in flu cases, follows weeks of largely plateauing emergency room figures nationwide ahead of Thanksgiving. Similar to this time last year, influenza emergency room visits are now outpacing COVID-19 for the first time in months across most age groups. Only in seniors do rates of COVID-19 remain many times higher than influenza.Nursing homes have seen a steep rise in reported COVID-19 across recent weeks. In the Midwestern region spanning Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin, infections in nursing home residents have already topped rates seen at last year's peak.Is there a new COVID-19 variant? What to know about JN.1A new COVID-19 variant called JN.1 has been driving a growing share of the latest wave of infections, officials estimate. The JN.1 lineage — a closely related descendant of the highly mutated BA.2.86 variant that scientists first warned about over the summer — was estimated last week in the CDC's projections to make up as much as 29% of infections nationwide. That's up from 8.8% at the end of November. Health officials have been closely tracking the acceleration of BA.2.86 and its descendants, like JN.1, around the world in recent months. More than 4 in 10 test results from the CDC's airport testing program for international travelers have turned up these strains.A panel of experts convened by the World Health Organization concluded this month that JN.1's changes were not steep enough to warrant a new revision to this season's vaccines, but acknowledged early data suggesting these shots were less effective at neutralizing the strain."CDC projects that JN.1 will continue to increase as a proportion of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences. It is currently the fastest-growing variant in the United States," the CDC said last week."Right now, we do not know to what extent JN.1 may be contributing to these increases or possible increases through the rest of December like those seen in previous years," they wrote.However, so far the CDC had said that so far JN.1's fast spread does not appear to be leading to any upticks in the severity posed by COVID-19. How big is the vaccination gap?As COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses have accelerated in recent weeks, health officials say they have also been closely tracking an unprecedented drop in vaccinations this season.Data from insurance claims suggest flu vaccinations in adults are around 8 million doses behind vaccination levels seen last year. The CDC's survey data suggests flu shots in children are also down around 5 percentage points from the same time last year. "Covering the missed volume is going to be very difficult or not possible," vaccine manufacturers concluded at a recent stakeholder meeting with the CDC, according to a readout from the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit.Health officials have also been urging providers to redouble their efforts to buoy COVID-19 vaccinations this year, especially for those most at-risk of severe disease like seniors.In nursing homes, just a third of residents and less than 1 in 10 staff are vaccinated with this season's COVID-19 shot. "We aren't seeing the uptake in vaccines that we would like to see," CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen told doctors at an American Medical Association event Tuesday.Cohen also cited survey data on uptake of the RSV vaccinations, which were greenlighted for the first time this year in older adults. Around 16% of adults ages 60 and older say they have gotten the shot."We acknowledge that is too low and it is one of the reasons we wanted to have this conversation," she said.

Back to Healio Key takeaways:A recombinant flu vaccine had a relative effectiveness of 15% compared with a standard dose vaccine.The finding was from a study of adults aged younger than 65 years.A recombinant influenza vaccine offered additional protection against PCR-confirmed influenza and community-acquired pneumonia hospitalization among adults aged 50 to 64 years compared with a standard-dose vaccine, study results showed.Although past studies have shown that high-dose influenza vaccines offer benefits for adults aged 65 years or older, “Data are needed on the relative effectiveness of recombinant vaccines as compared with standard-dose vaccines against influenza-related outcomes in adults under the age of 65 years,” Amber Hsiao, PhD, MPH, senior research project manager at Kaiser Permanente’s Vaccine Study Center, and colleagues wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine. A high-dose influenza vaccine reduce infection risk by more than 15% compared with standard-dose vaccines. Image: Scott Housley/CDC Their study compared the efficacy of two standard-dose, egg-based influenza vaccines with a high-dose recombinant influenza vaccine and found that the high-dose vaccine had a relative efficacy of more than 15% over the standard-dose vaccines.In addition to containing three times the amount of hemagglutinin protein as standard-dose vaccines, recombinant vaccines are not susceptible to antigenic drift during manufacturing, which occurs in vaccine viruses grown in eggs. High-dose influenza vaccines have been recommended for people age 65 years or older since 2022. “This large study adds to what we know about relative effectiveness of flu vaccines, which are given to millions of Americans each year, and on which we rely to reduce illness and hospitalization, particularly among vulnerable groups,” Hsiao said in a press release.Hsiao and colleagues conducted a cluster-randomized observational study of 1.6 million people aged between 18 years and 64 years who received either the high-dose recombinant vaccine (38.8%) or a standard-dose vaccine (61.2%) at a Kaiser Permanente Northern California health facility during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 influenza seasons. The primary outcome for the study was influenza confirmed by PCR testing among patients aged 50 years to 64 years, with secondary outcomes of influenza A, influenza B and influenza-related hospitalization outcomes.PCR tests were performed on 16,340 study participants, with 23.4% testing positive for influenza — 1,386 cases in the recombinant group and 2,435 cases in the standard-dose group, according to the study.Of PCR-confirmed influenza cases, 38% occurred among patients aged between 50 years and 64 years and 61.2% were in people aged 18 years to 49 years. For patients aged between 50 years and age 64 years, 559 participants (or two cases per 1,000) tested positive for influenza in the recombinant vaccine group compared with 925 (2.34 cases per 1,000) positive tests in the standard dose group, for a relative vaccine effectiveness against influenza infection of 15.3% (95% CI, 5.9%-23.8%).A secondary analysis identified a 15.7% relative vaccine effectiveness against influenza A infection among older participants in the recombinant group compared with the standard-dose group. Benefits against influenza B and hospitalizations were not significant, according to the study, but the researchers said a post hoc analysis combining PCR-confirmed influenza and hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia found the recombinant vaccine reduced cases by 19.7% (95% CI, 2.8%-33.7%).“If standard-dose vaccines were already preventing most cases of influenza and breakthrough cases of influenza, preventing 15% of breakthrough cases would be of modest public health benefit,” Hsiao and colleagues wrote. “However, since standard-dose vaccines prevent at most 40% to 60% of influenza cases annually, reducing the incidence of breakthrough influenza would provide a substantial public health benefit, especially during more severe influenza seasons.”In subgroup and exploratory analyses, the relative vaccine effectiveness of the high-dose vaccine was 10.2% and 10.8% against influenza A and diagnosed influenza, respectively, among participants aged 18 to 49 years.References:Flublok vaccine improved protections from flu for older adults. https://divisionofresearch.kaiserpermanente.org/flublok-vaccine-comparison/.

Alqifari6 Show authors Scientific Reports volume 13, Article number: 22037 (2023) Cite this article 673 Accesses Metrics details Subjects DiseasesMathematics and computingMedical research AbstractInfluenza epidemic data are seasonal in nature. Zero-inflation, zero-deflation, overdispersion, and underdispersion are frequently seen in such number of cases of disease (count) data. To explain these counts’ features, this paper introduces a flexible model for nonnegative integer-valued time series with a seasonal autoregressive structure. Some probabilistic properties of the model are discussed for general seasonal INAR(p) model and three estimation methods are used to estimate the model parameters for its special case seasonal INAR(1) model. The performance of the estimation procedures has been studied using simulation. The proposed model is applied to analyze weekly influenza data from the Breisgau- Hochschwarzwald county of Baden–Württemberg state, Germany. The empirical findings show that the suggested model performs better than existing models.

Influenza shows a seasonal pattern1 in temperate regions. The weekly/monthly/yearly epidemic data form a time series of counts. Analyzing and forecasting time series of counts remain a useful technique of getting information needed for successful policy making and management of epidemics. Before modeling a count time series, an analyst should be familiar with specific characteristics of the series in order to select a good model for the data. Dispersion characteristic, stationarity, autocorrelation structure and seasonality remain factors that help a researcher to determine the model that should be fitted to a count time series. Seasonality refers to the tendency of a time series (including low count time series) to exhibit patterns or movements that are completed within a year and repeat themselves every year. Seasonality deals with regular and predictable patterns in a time series. For example, a weekly time series of low counts is said to be seasonal with seasonal period s = 52 if its associated autocorrelation function has spikes at multiples of lag 52.New INAR processes have been constructed and used to model stationary nonseasonal count time series from a variety of fields since the independent works of Al-Osh and Alzaid2, and McKenzie3, which paved the way for research on the applications and construction of nonnegative integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) processes. Several models were constructed for stationary, overdispersed nonseasonal series based on the binomial thinning operator and first-order autoregressive correlation structure4,5. Authors who used other thinning operators to build models for the count time series include Liu and Zhu6, and Ristić et al.7. There is also evidence of stationary, first-order integer-valued autoregressive processes, which were constructed using innovation distributions, that can exhibit any of the underdispersion, equidispersion and overdispersion phenomena8,9,10.An INAR(1) process with an innovation distribution that is basically a standard discrete or compound Poisson distribution has been described as inappropriate for modeling any of underdispersed and overdispersed series with either inflation or a deflation of zeros11. Zero-modified distributions are useful in modeling count data with an inflation or deflation of zeros. The zero-modified versions of some discrete distributions have been introduced and used as innovation distributions to construct INAR(1) models by some authors. For example, Barreto-Souza11 constructed a zero-modified geometric INAR(1) process using the negative binomial thinning operator and illustrated empirically the applicability of the model using two practical data sets. In particular, the model may be used to describe an underdispersed or overdispersed series with deflationary or inflationary zeros. Sharafi et al.12 suggested an INAR(1) process using the zero-modified Poisson–Lindley (ZMPL) distributed innovations. They fitted the model to both zero-deflated and zero-inflated series and compared the model’s fit to each data set to that of competing models. Empirically speaking, their model outperformed the other models fitted to each of the data sets.Sometimes, it is necessary to analyze time series that exhibit seasonal variations. Such time series are called seasonal time series. Seasonal time series of counts are seen in several domains, including epidemiology13. Though authors have analyzed several seasonal epidemiological data using the Guassian multiplicative seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA) model14,15,16 and Holt–Winter’s Method16, these models may not be suitable for certain nonnegative count time series, especially those involving small counts17,18,19. In the case of seasonal low count time series, a seasonal nonnegative integer-valued autoregressive (INAR) model is needed. Unlike the SARIMA model, the seasonal INAR model takes into consideration the discrete nature of the data through an appropriate discrete innovation distribution. It can also be used to generate integer-valued forecasts. It can also be constructed to account for properties of count time series, such as overdispersion, underdispersion, zero-inflation and zero-deflation. Despite the extensive literature on INAR models, INAR models for stationary seasonal count time series have received little attention20,21,22. Remarkably, none of the seasonal models was developed for the purpose of analyzing an underdispersed or overdispersed seasonal count time series that is either zero-inflated or zero-deflated. This study intends to achieve two principal objectives. First, to propose a seasonal INAR process of order one that is suitable for underdispersed, overdispersed, zero-inflated and zero-deflated count time series data. Second, application of the model to influenza data. In view of the absence of the general seasonal INAR model in the literature, the theoretical framework is developed for the general seasonal INAR model in this paper.The remainder of this article is organized as follows: “Introduction” discusses the general seasonal INAR model. In “The general seasonal INAR model”, we deal with the construction and properties of the general seasonal INAR(p) model. Methods of estimating the parameters of the model are investigated, namely the Yule–Walker and conditional least squares. The theoretical aspect of forecasting based on the proposed model, simulation and real-world data application for a special case of the general seasonal model, namely the INAR\((1)_{s}\)ZMPL process are considered in “Construction of the proposed seasonal INAR(1) process and its properties”. The conclusions of this research are summarized in “Conclusion”.The general seasonal INAR modelIn response to the comment made by one of the anonymous reviewers, and considering that the literature lacks a general seasonal INAR model, we introduce the general seasonal INAR model in this section. Let “\(*\)” be the negative binomial thinning (NBT) operator and \(\lambda *W= \sum _{i=1}^W Z_i,\) where \({Z_i}\) refers to the sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) geometric variables having the probability mass function (PMF)$$\begin{aligned} P[Z_i=w]=\frac{\lambda ^w}{\left( 1+\lambda \right) ^{w+1}}, w \in \mathbb {N}_0, \lambda \in [0, 1). \end{aligned}$$An elaborate discussion of the properties of the NBT operator is available in Ristić et al.7. The general seasonal INAR model of order P and seasonal period s (INAR\((P)_s\) model) is defined by$$\begin{aligned} W_t=\lambda _1*W_{t-s}+\lambda _2*W_{t-2s}+\cdots +\lambda _P*W_{t-Ps}+\nu _t, \quad t \in \mathbb {N}_0. \end{aligned}$$ (1) In (1), the counting series are mutually independent, \(\lambda _l \in \left[ 0,1\right] ,~l=1, 2, \ldots , P\) and \(\left\{ \nu _t \right\}\) are independent of all the counting series.Theorem 2.1 contains the condition for the existence of a unique stationary INAR\((P)_s\) model. Theorem 2.1 Let \(\left\{ \nu _t \right\}\) be i.i.d., nonnegative integer-valued random variables whose mean and variance are E\((\nu _t)= \mu _v\) and Var\((\nu _t)= \sigma _\nu ^2\) respectively. Suppose that \(\lambda _l \in \left[ 0,1\right] ,~l=1, 2, \ldots , P\). If the roots of the equation$$\begin{aligned} z^P-\lambda _1 z^{P-1}-\lambda _2 z^{P-2}-\cdots -\lambda _P=0 \end{aligned}$$lie inside the unit circle, then there is a unique stationary nonnegative integer-valued series \(\left\{ W_t \right\}\) that satisfies the equation$$\begin{aligned} W_t=\lambda _1*W_{t-s}+\lambda _2*W_{t-2s}+\cdots +\lambda _P*W_{t-Ps}+\nu _t, \quad t \in \mathbb {N}_0. \end{aligned}$$ Proof The proof of Theorem 2.1 is based on some properties of the NBT operator. These properties, which were established by Ristić et al.7 are as follows (i) E \(\left[ \prod _{m=1}^r\left( \lambda _m *W_m\right) \right] =\prod _{m=1}^r \lambda _m E\left( W_m\right) , r \ge 1\) (ii) \(E \left( \lambda *W\right) ^2 =\lambda ^2E \left( W\right) ^2+\lambda (1+\lambda )E \left( W\right)\) (iii) \(E \left( \lambda *W-\lambda *Y \right) ^2=\lambda (1+\lambda )E \left( \vert W-Y \vert \right) +\lambda ^2 E \left( \vert W-Y \vert \right) ^2,\) if each of the counting series of \(\lambda *W\) and \(\lambda *Y\) has the geometric \(\left( \frac{\lambda }{1+\lambda }\right)\) distribution. The remaining part of the proof can be deduced from the proof of Theorem 2.1 in Jin-Guan and Yuan23. \(\square\) Taking expectation of both sides of (1) and assuming stationarity, the mean of the INAR\((P)_s\) model becomes$$\begin{aligned} \mu _W=E \left( W_t\right) =\frac{\mu _\nu }{1-\sum _{l=1}^P \lambda _l}. \end{aligned}$$ (2) Next, we study the autocorrelation structure of the INAR\((P)_s\) model. Let \({\textbf {W}}_t= \left( W_t, W_{t-s}, W_{t-2s}, \ldots , W_{t-(P+1)s} \right)' .\)Then (1) can be written as$$\begin{aligned} {\textbf {W}}_t={\textbf {C}}*{\textbf {W}}_{t-s}+ \varvec{\nu }_t, \end{aligned}$$ (3) where$$\begin{aligned} {\textbf {C}}= \begin{pmatrix} \lambda _1&{} \lambda _2&{} \cdots &{} \lambda _{P-1}&{} \lambda _P\\ 1&{}0&{}\cdots &{}0&{}0\\ \vdots &{}\vdots &{}\vdots \vdots \vdots &{}\vdots &{}\vdots \\ 0&{}0&{} \cdots &{}1&{}0 \end{pmatrix} ~\text {and}~ \varvec{\nu }_t= \begin{pmatrix} \nu _t\\ 0\\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}. \end{aligned}$$The vector of the autocovariances is defined by$$\begin{aligned} \varvec{\gamma }_k&=E \left[ \left( {\textbf {W}}_t-E({\textbf {W}}_t)\right) \left( {\textbf {W}}_{t-k}-E({\textbf {W}}_{t-k})\right) ^\top \right] \\&=E\left( {\textbf {W}}_t {\textbf {W}}_{t-k}^\top \right) -E\left( {\textbf {W}}_t\right) E\left( {\textbf {W}}_{t-k}^\top \right) \\&={\textbf {C}}E\left( {\textbf {W}}_{t-s} {\textbf {W}}_{t-k}^\top\right) + E\left( \varvec{\nu }_t\right) E\left( {\textbf {W}}_{t-k}^\top \right) -E\left( {\textbf {W}}_t\right) E\left( {\textbf {W}}_{t-k}^\top \right) \\&={\textbf {C}}\varvec{\gamma }_{(k-s)}+\left( {\textbf {C}}-{\textbf {I}}\right) E\left( {\textbf {W}}_{t-s} \right) E\left( {\textbf {W}}_{t-k}^\top \right) +E\left( \varvec{\nu }_t\right) E\left( {\textbf {W}}_{t-k}^\top \right) \end{aligned}$$Since \(E\left( {\textbf {W}}_t\right) ={\textbf {C}}E\left( {\textbf {W}}_{t-s}\right) + E\left( \varvec{\nu }_t\right)\), it is easy to verify that \(\left( {\textbf {C}}-{\textbf {I}}\right) E\left( {\textbf {W}}_{t-s} \right) E\left( {\textbf {W}}_{t-k}^\top \right) +E\left( \varvec{\nu }_t\right) E\left( {\textbf {W}}_{t-k}^\top \right)\) is a null matrix. Thus$$\begin{aligned} \varvec{\gamma }_k={\textbf {C}}\varvec{\gamma }_{(k-s)}, ~ k>0. \end{aligned}$$ (4) It follows that the autocovariance function at lag k is$$\begin{aligned} \gamma _k=\lambda _1\gamma _{k-s}+\lambda _2\gamma _{k-2s}+\cdots +\lambda _P\gamma _{k-Ps}. \end{aligned}$$ (5) The associated autocorrelation coefficient has the form:$$\begin{aligned} \rho _k=\lambda _1 \rho _{k-s}+\lambda _2 \rho _{k-2s}+\cdots +\lambda _P \rho _{k-Ps}. \end{aligned}$$ (6) In view of (6), it is obvious that the model under consideration and the Gaussian AR model of order P and seasonal period ‘s' have similar autocorrelation structures. Hence, the identification of the model can be done using the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF). Theoretically speaking, the ACF of the INAR\((P)_s\) model has nonzero values at the seasonal lags. The nonzero values at the seasonal lags tail off while the related partial ACF cuts off after lag P. When we have a stationary seasonal time series with sample ACF and sample partial ACF that have patterns that are akin to the theoretical ACF and sample partial ACF, we are expected to fit the INAR\((P)_s\) model to the data. In situations where, the sample ACF and sample partial ACF do not look exactly like their theoretical counterparts, a variety of models can be fitted to the given data and the best model is determined using model selection criteria24.The parameters \(\lambda _l,~l=1, 2, \ldots , P\) of the model can be estimated using any of the Yule–Walker and conditional least squares approaches. For \(k=s, 2s, \ldots , Ps\), we derive P equations from (6). These equations are written in matrix form as$$\begin{aligned} \varvec{\Delta } \varvec{\lambda }= \varvec{\rho }, \end{aligned}$$where$$\begin{aligned} \varvec{\Delta }= \begin{pmatrix} 1&{} \rho _s&{} \cdots &{} \rho _{(P-1)s}\\ \rho _s&{}1&{}\cdots &{}\rho _{(P-2)s}\\ \vdots &{}\vdots &{}\vdots \vdots \vdots &{}\vdots \\ \rho _{(P-1)s}&{}\rho _{(P-2)s}&{}\cdots &{}1 \end{pmatrix},~ \varvec{\lambda }= \begin{pmatrix} \lambda _1\\ \lambda _2\\ \vdots \\ \lambda _P \end{pmatrix} ~\text {and}~ \varvec{\rho }= \begin{pmatrix} \rho _s\\ \rho _{2s}\\ \vdots \\ \rho _{Ps} \end{pmatrix}. \end{aligned}$$The Yule–Walker estimator \(\hat{\varvec{\lambda }}\) of \(\varvec{\lambda }\) is given as$$\begin{aligned} \hat{ \varvec{\lambda }}= \hat{\varvec{\Delta }} ^{-1}\hat{\varvec{\rho }}. \end{aligned}$$ (7) For example, for a second order monthly count time series, \(s=12\) and the estimates \(\hat{\lambda }_{1}\) and \(\hat{\lambda }_{1}\) based on sample autocorrelation coefficients at lags 12 and 24 are given as.$$\begin{aligned} \begin{pmatrix} \hat{\lambda }_{1}\\ \\ \hat{\lambda }_{1}\\ \end{pmatrix} =\begin{pmatrix} 1 &{} \hat{\rho }_{12}\\ \\ \hat{\rho }_{12}&{} 1\\ \end{pmatrix}^{-1} \begin{pmatrix} \hat{\rho }_{12}\\ \\ \hat{\rho }_{24}\\ \end{pmatrix}. \end{aligned}$$ (8) In (7),$$\begin{aligned} \hat{\varvec{\Delta }}= \begin{pmatrix} 1&{} \hat{\rho }_s&{} \cdots &{} \hat{\rho }_{(P-1)s}\\ \hat{\rho }_s&{}1&{}\cdots &{}\hat{\rho }_{(P-2)s}\\ \vdots &{}\vdots &{}\vdots \vdots \vdots &{}\vdots \\ \hat{\rho }_{(P-1)s}&{}\hat{\rho }_{(P-2)s}&{}\cdots &{}1 \end{pmatrix},~ \hat{ \varvec{\lambda }}= \begin{pmatrix} \hat{\lambda }_1\\ \hat{\lambda }_2\\ \vdots \\ \hat{\lambda }_P \end{pmatrix} ~\text {and}~ \hat{\varvec{\rho }}= \begin{pmatrix} \hat{\rho }_s\\ \hat{\rho }_{2s}\\ \vdots \\ \hat{\rho }_{Ps} \end{pmatrix}. \end{aligned}$$Furthermore, the Yule–Walker estimate of \(\mu _\nu\) is$$\begin{aligned} \hat{\mu }_\nu =\left( 1-\hat{\lambda }_1-\hat{\lambda }_2-\cdots -\hat{\lambda }_P\right) \bar{W}. \end{aligned}$$ (9) The corresponding estimate of \(\sigma _\nu ^2\) is$$\begin{aligned} \hat{\sigma }_\nu ^2=\frac{\sum _{t=Ps+1}^n \left( \hat{\nu }_t-\bar{\nu }_t\right) ^2}{n-Ps}. \end{aligned}$$ (10) Notably,$$\begin{aligned} \hat{\nu }_t =W_t-\hat{\lambda }_1 W_{t-s}-\hat{\lambda }_2W_{t-2s}-\cdots -\hat{\lambda }_PW_{t-Ps} \end{aligned}$$and$$\begin{aligned} \bar{\nu }_t=\frac{\sum _{t=Ps+1}^n \hat{\nu }_t}{n-Ps}. \end{aligned}$$Let \(\varvec{\Theta }=\left( \mu _\nu , \lambda _1, \lambda _2, \ldots , \lambda _P\right) ^\top\), \(g(\varvec{\Theta },F_t) =\lambda _1W_{t-s}+\lambda _2W_{t-2s}+\cdots +\lambda _PW_{t-Ps}+\mu _\nu\) and \(Q(\varvec{\Theta })= \sum _{Ps+1}^n \left( W_t-g(\varvec{\Theta },F_t)\right) ^2.\)The CLS estimator \(\hat{\varvec{\Theta }}\) of \(\varvec{\Theta }\) is obtained by minimizing \(Q(\varvec{\Theta })\). In this case, we solve the following equations simultaneously:$$\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial Q(\varvec{\Theta })}{\partial \mu _\nu }&=0;\\ \frac{\partial Q(\varvec{\Theta })}{\partial \lambda _l}&=0,~l=1,2, \ldots ,P. \end{aligned}$$Certain properties of CLS estimators are well-known (see, Klimko and Nelson25).The minimum mean squared error (MMSE) predictor of \(W_{n+1}\) is$$\begin{aligned} \hat{W}_n(1)&=E\left( W_{n+1} \vert \mathscr {F}_n \right) \\&=\lambda _1W_{n+1-s}+\lambda _2W_{n+1-2s}+\cdots +\lambda _PW_{n+1-Ps}+\mu _\nu \end{aligned}$$In general, the MMSE of \(W_{n+m}\) becomes$$\begin{aligned} \hat{W}_n(m)&=\displaystyle \sum _{l=1}^P E\left( W_{n+m} \vert \mathscr {F}_n \right) \nonumber \\&=\displaystyle \sum _{l=1}^P E\left( \lambda _l*W_{n+m-ls} \vert \mathscr {F}_n \right) +\mu _\nu \nonumber \\&=\displaystyle \sum _{l=1}^P E\left[ E\left( \lambda _l*W_{n+m-ls} \vert W_{n+m-ls}, \mathscr {F}_n \right) \vert \mathscr {F}_n \right] \nonumber \\&=\displaystyle \sum _{l=1}^P \lambda _l E\left( W_{n+m-ls} \vert \mathscr {F}_n \right) \nonumber \\&=\displaystyle \sum _{l=1}^P \lambda _l \hat{W}_n(m-ls)+\mu _\nu . \end{aligned}$$ (11) We have carried out a simulation study to assess the performance of the Yule–Walker (YW) and conditional least squares(CLS) estimates. For the sake of brevity we consider INAR\((2)_{S}\) model and its parameter estimation. We simulated 1000 series from the proposed model for various parameter combinations and for various sample sizes as given in Table 1. We have computed the mean estimates and their related MSEs based on 1000 simulations. In this study, we estimated two autoregressive parameters (\(\lambda _{1}\) and \(\lambda _{2}\)) and the mean of the innovation distribution (\(\mu _{\nu }\)). For simulation from an innovation distribution, we use the parameter combinations: \(\alpha =(4,1,2,0.5)\) and \(\delta =(-2,0.5,-1,0.7)\), which give the mean of the innovation distribution as \(\mu _{\nu }=(0.9,0.75,1.3333,1.00)\). The estimation of AR coefficient and all the parameters of innovation distribution have been studied in detail for INAR\((1)_{S}\) model in “Construction of the proposed seasonal INAR(1) process and its properties”. From Table 1, it can be seen that the estimates perform well, and their mean squared errors (MSEs) decrease as the sample size increases. It also can be seen that the CLS estimation performs much better than the YW estimation in terms of the MSE. As the joint distribution of \(\lambda _{1} *W_{t-s}\) and \(\lambda _{2} *W_{t-2s}\) is not tractable, we can not find the conditional distribution and hence maximum likelihood estimation cannot be attempted, as it has been done for INAR\((1)_{S}\) model in “Construction of the proposed seasonal INAR(1) process and its properties”.Table 1 Parameter estimates and their mean squared errors for INAR\((2)_{S}\) model.Full size tableConstruction of the proposed seasonal INAR(1) process and its propertiesIn this section, the definition of the first-order seasonal INAR process based on zero-modified Poisson–Lindley (ZMPL) innovations12 and NBT operation is given, with an extensive study. Using the NBT operator, we define the proposed seasonal INAR(1) process as follows. Definition 3.1 Let \(\lbrace W_t\rbrace\) be a discrete-time nonnegative integer-valued process. Then, the process is a seasonal INAR(1) process with zero-modified Poisson–Lindley innovations if$$\begin{aligned} W_t=\lambda *W_{t-s}+\nu _t, \quad t \in \mathbb {N}_0, \end{aligned}$$ (12) where ‘s’ represents the seasonal period such that \(s \in \mathbb {N}^+\), \(\mathbb {N}^+\) is the set of positive integers, \(\lbrace W_t\rbrace\) stands for a sequence of identically distributed nonnegative random variables, \(\lbrace \nu _t\rbrace\) is an innovation sequence of i.i.d. ZMPL random variables not depending on the past values of \(\lbrace W_t\rbrace\) and the thinnings of \(\lbrace W_t\rbrace\) and the random variables \(\lbrace W_{t-s}\rbrace\), \(\lbrace W_{t-2s}\rbrace\), \(\ldots ,\) are independent. Figure 1Sample path, sample ACF and sample PACF for simulated data: first row- \(\lambda =0.6,~~\alpha =4,~~\delta =-2\); second row- \(\lambda =0.7,~~\alpha =5,~~\delta =0\); Third row- \(\lambda =0.8,~~\alpha =8,~~\delta =0.5\), seasonal period \(S=52\).Full size imageIn the sequel, the notation INAR(1)\(_s\)ZMPL process is used to represent the model defined in Eq. (12). A random variable X follows the ZMPL distribution with parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\delta\) if its PMF is$$\begin{aligned} P(X=x)= {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \delta +(1-\delta )\frac{\alpha ^2(\alpha +2)}{(\alpha +1)^3},&{}\quad x=0\\ (1-\delta )\frac{\alpha ^2(x+\alpha +2)}{(\alpha +1)^{x+3}},&{}\quad x \in \mathbb {N^+}, \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$ (13) where \(\alpha >0\) and \(-\frac{\alpha ^2(\alpha +2)}{\alpha ^2+3\alpha +1} \le \delta \le 1.\) Thus, the unconditional mean and variance of the random variable \(\lbrace \nu _t\rbrace\) are, respectively, given by$$\begin{aligned} \text {E}\left( \nu _t\right) =\mu _{\nu }=(1-\delta ) \frac{\alpha +2}{\alpha (\alpha +1)} \end{aligned}$$ (14) and$$\begin{aligned} \text {Var}\left( \nu _t\right) =\sigma ^2_{\nu }=(1-\delta ) \frac{\alpha ^3+4\alpha ^2+6\alpha +2+\delta (\alpha +2)^2}{\alpha ^2 (\alpha +1)^2}. \end{aligned}$$ (15) Following26, the distribution of the random variable (RV) \(\nu _t\) is overdispersed if \(\delta \in [0, 1)\), while it is underdispersed when \(\alpha > \sqrt{2}\) and \(\delta \in \left( \frac{-\alpha ^2(\alpha +2)}{\alpha ^2+3\alpha +1}, 0 \right) .\) The INAR(1)\(_s\)ZMPL process comprises ‘s’ mutually independent INAR(1) processes with ZMPL innovations, which are constructed using the NBT operator such that they have the autoregressive parameter \(\lambda\) and an innovation distribution. The simulated sample paths, sample ACFs and sample PACFs of the process for various parameter combinations are given in the Fig. 1. The seasonality in the simulated data can be seen from the time series plots as well as ACF plots in the figure. Let \(W_t^{(r)}=W_{ts+r}, \quad t \in \mathbb {N}_0\), where \(\mathbb {N}_0\) is a set of nonnegative integers. For \(r=0,1,2, \ldots , s-1\), the process \(\lbrace W_t^{(r)} \rbrace\) satisfies the model:$$\begin{aligned} W_t^{(r)}=\lambda *W_{t-1}^{(r)}+\nu _t^{(r)}, \quad t \in \mathbb {N}_0. \end{aligned}$$Here, the innovation sequences \(\lbrace \nu _t^{(r)} \rbrace\) satisfy the equation \(\nu _t^{(r)}=\nu _{ts+r}\). The independence of \(\lbrace W_t^{(r)} \rbrace\) is the direct implication of the independence of \(\lbrace \nu _t^{(r)} \rbrace\) and the counting processes that define the requisite thinning operators. Additionally, the process defined in Eq. (12) is an s-step Markov chain, implying that\(P\left( W_t=w_t\vert W_{t-1}=w_{t-1}, \ldots , W_0=w_0\right) =P\left( W_t=w_t\vert W_{t-s}=w_{t-s}\right), \quad w_0, w_1, \ldots , w_{s-1} \in \mathbb {N}_0.\)The conditional mean of the process is$$\begin{aligned} \text {E} \left( W_t \vert W_{t-s} \right)&= \text {E} \left( \lambda *W_{t-s}+\nu _t \vert W_{t-s} \right) \nonumber \\&=\lambda W_{t-s} +\mu _\nu . \end{aligned}$$ (16) Hence, the unconditional expectation of the process is$$\begin{aligned} \text {E} \left( W_t\right)&=\left( \text {E} \left( W_t \vert W_{t-s} \right) \right) \nonumber \\&=\lambda \text {E} \left( W_{t-s}\right) +\mu _\nu . \end{aligned}$$ (17) Assuming stationarity and using Eq. (17), the unconditional mean is found to be$$\begin{aligned} \text {E} \left( W_t\right) =\frac{\mu _\nu }{1-\lambda }= \mu _W. \end{aligned}$$The conditional variance satisfies the equation:$$\begin{aligned} \text {Var} \left( W_t \vert W_{t-s} \right)&= \text {Var} \left( \lambda *W_{t-s}+\nu _t \vert W_{t-s} \right) \nonumber \\&=\text {Var} \left( \lambda *W_{t-s}\vert W_{t-s} \right) +\sigma _\nu ^2\nonumber \\&=\lambda ^2\text {E} \left( W_{t-s}^2\vert W_{t-s} \right) +\lambda (\lambda +1)\text {E} \left( W_{t-s}\vert W_{t-s}\right) -\lambda ^2\left( \text {E} \left( W_{t-s}\vert W_{t-s} \right) \right) ^2\nonumber \\&\quad +\sigma _\nu ^2\nonumber \\&=\lambda ^2\text {Var} \left( W_{t-s}\vert W_{t-s} \right) +\lambda (\lambda +1)\text {E} \left( W_{t-s}\vert W_{t-s}\right) +\sigma _\nu ^2\nonumber \\&=\lambda (\lambda +1) W_{t-s}+\sigma _\nu ^2. \end{aligned}$$ (18) The unconditional variance is obtained as$$\begin{aligned} \text {Var} \left( W_t\right)&=\text {E} \left( \text {Var} \left( W_t \vert W_{t-s} \right) \right) +\text {Var} \left( \text {E} \left( W_t \vert W_{t-s} \right) \right) \nonumber \\&=\lambda (\lambda +1) \text {E} \left( W_{t-s}\right) +\sigma _\nu ^2+\lambda ^2 \text {Var} \left( W_{t-s}\right) . \end{aligned}$$ (19) Hence, it follows that$$\begin{aligned} \text {Var}(W_t)=\frac{\lambda (\lambda +1) \mu _\nu +(1-\lambda )\sigma _\nu ^2}{(1-\lambda )(1-\lambda ^2)}=\sigma _W^2. \end{aligned}$$Suppose that \(W_{(k+h)s+j}\) and \(W_{ks+i}\) satisfy the process in Eq. (12), \(h \in \mathbb {N}^+\) and \(k \in \mathbb {N}_0,~ i, j=1,2, \ldots , s\). In order to gain insight into conditional moments based on the seasonal period as well as the autocorrelation function of the process, we proceed to give the following propositions: Proposition 3.1 The conditional expectation of \(W_{(k+h)s+j}\) given \(W_{ks+i}\) is$$\begin{aligned} \text {E}\left( W_{(k+h)s+j} \vert W_{ks+i} \right) ={\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \frac{\mu _\nu }{1-\lambda },&{} \text {if}~i\ne j\\ \lambda ^h W_{ks+i}+(1-\lambda ^h)\mu _W, &{} \text {if}~i= j \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$and \(\lim \nolimits _{h \rightarrow \infty } \text {E}\left( W_{(k+h)s+j} \vert W_{ks+i} \right) =\mu _W.\) Proof Let \(W_{(k+h)s+j}=W_{k+h}^{(j)}\) and \(W_{ks+i}=W_{k}^{(i)}\). If \(i\ne j\), the conditional expectation of \(W_{k+h}^{(j)}\) given \(W_{k}^{(i)}\) is equal to \(\frac{\mu _\nu }{1-\lambda }\), which is the unconditional expectation of \(W_t\). If \(i=j\), we have$$\begin{aligned} \text {E}\left( W_{(k+h)s+j} \vert W_{ks+i} \right)&= \text {E}\left( W_{k+h}^{(j)} \vert W_{k}^{(j)} \right) \\&=\lambda \text {E}\left( W_{k+h-1}^{(j)} \vert W_{k}^{(j)} \right) + \text {E}(\left( \nu _{k+h}^{(j)} \vert W_{k}^{(i)} \right) \\&=\lambda \text {E}\left( W_{k+h-1}^{(j)} \vert W_{k}^{(j)} \right) +\mu _\nu \\&=\lambda ^2\text {E}\left( W_{k+h-2}^{(j)} \vert W_{k}^{(i)} \right) +(\lambda +1)\mu _\nu \\&.~.~.\\&=\lambda ^h\text {E}\left( W_{k}^{(j)} \vert W_{k}^{(j)} \right) +(\lambda ^{h-1}+\lambda ^{h-2}+\cdots +\lambda +1)\mu _\nu \\&=\lambda ^hW_k^{(j)}+\frac{1-\lambda ^h}{1-\lambda }\mu _\nu \\&=\lambda ^hW_{ks+i}+(1-\lambda ^h)\mu _W. \end{aligned}$$ Consequently,$$\begin{aligned} \underset{h \rightarrow \infty }{\lim }\ \text {E}\left( W_{(k+h)s+j} \vert W_{ks+i} \right)&= \underset{h \rightarrow \infty }{\lim } \text {E}\left( \lambda ^hW_k^{(j)}+\frac{1-\lambda ^h}{1-\lambda }\mu _\nu \right) \\&=\frac{\mu _\nu }{1-\lambda }\\&=\mu _W. \end{aligned}$$ The proof comes to an end here. \(\square\) Proposition 3.2 The conditional variance of \(W_{(k+h)s+j}\) given \(W_{ks+i}\) is$$\begin{aligned} \text {Var}\left( W_{(k+h)s+j} \vert W_{ks+i} \right) ={\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \frac{\lambda (\lambda +1)\mu _\nu +(1-\lambda )\sigma _\nu ^2}{(1-\lambda )(1-\lambda ^2)},&{} \text {if}~i\ne j\\ (\lambda +1)\left( \frac{\lambda ^{h}(1-\lambda ^h)}{1-\lambda }\right) W_k^{(j)}\\ + \frac{\lambda (\lambda +1)}{1-\lambda } \left( \frac{1-\lambda ^{2(h-1)}}{1-\lambda ^2}-\lambda ^{h-1} \left( \frac{1-\lambda ^{(h-1)}}{1-\lambda }\right) \right) \mu _\nu \\ +\left( \frac{1-\lambda ^{2h}}{1-\lambda ^2}\right) \sigma _\nu ^2, &{} \text {if}~i= j \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$and \(\lim \nolimits _{h \rightarrow \infty } \text {Var}\left( W_{(k+h)s+j} \vert W_{ks+i} \right) =\sigma _W^2.\) Proof If \(i \ne j\), \(W_{k+h}^{(j)}\) and \(W_{k}^{(i)}\) are independent. Thus, the conditional variance of \(W_{(k+h)s+j}\) given \(W_{ks+i}\) is \(\frac{\lambda (\lambda +1)\mu _\nu +(1-\lambda )\sigma _\nu ^2}{(1-\lambda )(1-\lambda ^2)}\), the unconditional variance of \(W_t\). If \(i=j\), then$$\begin{aligned} \text {Var}\left( W_{(k+h)s+j} \big \vert W_{ks+i} \right)&= \text {Var}\left( W_{k+h}^{(j)} \big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) \\&=\text {Var}\left( \left( \lambda *W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}+ \nu _{k+h}^{(j)} \right) \big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) \\&=\text {Var}\left( \lambda *W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) +\text {Var}\left( \nu _{k+h}^{(j)} \big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) \\&=\lambda ^2\text {Var}\left( W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) +\lambda (\lambda +1) \text {E}\left( W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) \\&\quad +\sigma _\nu ^2\\&=\lambda ^2\text {Var}\left( \lambda *W_{k+h-2}^{(j)}+\nu _{k+h-1}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) \\&\quad +\lambda (\lambda +1) \text {E}\left( W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) +\sigma _\nu ^2\\&=\lambda ^4\text {E}\left( (W_{k+h-2}^{(j)})^2\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) -\lambda ^4\left( \text {E}\left( W_{k+h-2}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) \right) ^2\\&\quad +\lambda ^3(\lambda +1)\text {E}\left( W_{k+h-2}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) \\&\quad +\lambda (\lambda +1) \text {E}\left( W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) +\lambda ^2\sigma _\nu ^2+\sigma _\nu ^2\\&=\lambda ^4\text {Var}\left( W_{k+h-2}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) + \lambda ^3(\lambda +1)\text {E}\left( W_{k+h-2}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) \\&\quad +\lambda (\lambda +1) \text {E}\left( W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) +\lambda ^2\sigma _\nu ^2+\sigma _\nu ^2\\&=.~.~.\\&=\lambda ^{2h}\text {Var}\left( W_k^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) +\lambda (\lambda +1)M\\&\quad +\left( \lambda ^{2(h-1)}+ \lambda ^{2(h-2)}+\cdots +\lambda ^{2}+1\right) \sigma _\nu ^2, \end{aligned}$$where$$\begin{aligned} M&=\lambda ^{2(h-1)}\text {E}\left( W_k^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) + \lambda ^{2(h-2)}\text {E}\left( W_{k+1}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) +\cdots + \lambda ^{2}\text {E}\left( W_{k+h-2}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) \\ {}&\quad +\text {E}\left( W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) . \end{aligned}$$ Notably, \(\text {Var}\left( W_k^{(j)}\big \vert W_k^{(j)} \right) =0\). Also, after some algebra with the earlier discussions, we can find that,$$\begin{aligned} M&=\frac{\lambda ^{(h-1)}\left( 1-\lambda ^{h}\right) }{1-\lambda }W_{k}^{(j)}+\frac{1}{1-\lambda } \left( \frac{1-\lambda ^{2(h-1)}}{1-\lambda ^{2}}-\frac{\lambda ^{(h-1)}\left( 1-\lambda ^{(h-1)}\right) }{1-\lambda }\right) \mu _\nu . \end{aligned}$$ In the light of the above, we have$$\begin{aligned} \text {Var}\left( W_{(k+h)s+j} \big \vert W_{ks+i} \right)&= (1+\lambda )\frac{\lambda ^{h}\left( 1-\lambda ^{h}\right) }{1-\lambda }W_{k}^{(j)}\\ {}&\quad +\frac{\lambda (1+\lambda )}{1-\lambda } \left( \frac{1-\lambda ^{2(h-1)}}{1-\lambda ^{2}}-\frac{\lambda ^{(h-1)}\left( 1-\lambda ^{(h-1)}\right) }{1-\lambda }\right) \mu _\nu \\ {}&\quad +\left( \frac{1-\lambda ^{2h}}{1-\lambda ^2}\right) \sigma _\nu ^2.\\ \end{aligned}$$ Hence,$$\begin{aligned} \underset{h \rightarrow \infty }{\lim }\ \text {Var}\left( W_{(k+h)s+j} \vert W_{ks+i} \right)&=\frac{\lambda (\lambda +1)\mu _\nu +(1-\lambda )\sigma _\nu ^2}{(1-\lambda )(1-\lambda ^2)}=\text {Var}\left( W_t\right) . \end{aligned}$$\(\square\) Proposition 3.3 The covariance of \(W_{(k+h)s+j}\) and \(W_{ks+i}\) has the form$$\begin{aligned} \text {Covar}\left( W_{(k+h)s+j},W_{ks+i} \right) ={\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0,&{}\text {if}~i\ne j\\ \lambda ^h \frac{\lambda (\lambda +1) \mu _\nu +(1-\lambda )\sigma _\nu ^2}{(1-\lambda )(1-\lambda ^2)},&{}\text {if}~i= j. \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$ Proof Once \(i \ne j\), the variables \(W_{(k+h)s+j}\) and \(W_{ks+i}\) are uncorrelated. In this case, \(\text {Covar}\left( W_{(k+h)s+j}, W_{ks+i} \right) =0.\)$$\mbox{On the other side,} \begin{aligned} \text {Covar}\left( W_{(k+h)s+j}, W_{ks+i} \right)&= \text {Covar}\left( W_{k+h}^{(j)}, W_{k}^{(j)} \right) \\&=\text {E}\left( (\lambda *W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}+\nu _{k+h}^{(j)} )W_{k}^{(j)} \right) \\&\quad -\text {E}\left( \lambda *W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}+\nu _{k+h}^{(j)}\right) \text {E}\left( W_{k}^{(j)} \right) \\&=\text {E}\left( \left( \displaystyle \sum _{q=1}^{W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}} Z_q\right) W_{k}^{(j)} \right) +\text {E}\left( \nu _{k+h}^{(j)} \right) \text {E}\left( W_{k}^{(j)} \right) \\ {}&\quad -\lambda \text {E}\left( W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}\right) \text {E}\left( W_{k}^{(j)} \right) -\text {E}\left( \nu _{k+h}^{(j)}\right) \text {E}\left( W_{k}^{(j)} \right) \\&=\text {E}\left[ \text {E}\left( \displaystyle \sum _{q=1}^{W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}} Z_q \big \vert W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}\right) \text {E}\left( W_{k}^{(j)} \big \vert W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}\right) \right] \\&\quad -\lambda \text {E}\left( W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}\right) \text {E}\left( W_{k}^{(j)} \right) \\&=\text {E}\left[ {W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}}W_{k}^{(j)} \text {E}\left( Z_q \right) \right] -\lambda \text {E}\left( W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}\right) \text {E}\left( W_{k}^{(j)} \right) \\&=\lambda \text {Cov}\left( {W_{k+h-1}^{(j)}},W_{k}^{(j)} \right) \\&\cdots \\&=\lambda ^h\text {Cov}\left( {W_{k}^{(j)}},W_{k}^{(j)} \right) \\&=\lambda ^h\text {Var}\left( {W_{k}^{(j)}}\right) =\lambda ^h\frac{\lambda (\lambda +1) \mu _\nu +(1-\lambda )\sigma _\nu ^2}{(1-\lambda )(1-\lambda ^2)}. \end{aligned}$$ Dividing the autocovariance function by \(\text {Var}\left( {W_t}\right)\), the autocorrelation function (ACF) is obtained as$$\begin{aligned} \rho (h)= {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \lambda ^{\frac{h}{s}},&{}\text { if }h \text { is a multiple of }s\\ 0,&{}\text {elsewhere}. \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$ Here, we have an exponentially decaying autocorrelation function. \(\square\) Techniques for estimating model parametersThree popular and widely used methods of point estimation for the parameters of the INAR\((1)_{S}\)ZMPL are adopted in this section. These are, the Yule–Walker, conditional least squares and conditional maximum likelihood methods. In each of the methods, we assume a realization of the seasonal count time series.Yule–Walker approachTo estimate the parameters \(\lambda\), \(\delta\) and \(\alpha\) of the INAR(1)\(_s\)ZMPL process, we form three equations by equating \(\hat{\rho }(s)\), \(\text {E}\left( W_t\right)\) and \(\text {Var}\left( W_t\right)\) to \(\frac{\hat{\gamma }(s)}{\hat{\gamma }(0)}\), \(\overline{W}\) and \(\hat{\gamma }(0)\), respectively.Notably, \(\overline{W}=\frac{ \sum _{t=1}^{n} W_t}{n}\), \(\hat{\gamma }(s)=\frac{1}{n} \sum _{t=s+1}^{n}\left( W_t-\overline{W}\right) \left( W_{t-s}-\overline{W}\right)\), and n are, respectively, the sample mean, sample autocorrelation function and length of the time series. If \(\hat{\lambda }_{\text {YW}}\), \(\hat{\delta }_{\text {YW}}\) and \(\hat{\alpha }_{\text {YW}}\) are the Yule–Walker (YW) estimators of \(\lambda\), \(\delta\) and \(\alpha\) in that order, then the following equations are needed:$$\begin{aligned}&\hat{\lambda }_{YW}=\frac{ \sum _{t=s+1}^{n}\left( W_t-\overline{W}\right) \left( W_{t-s}-\overline{W}\right) }{\sum _{t=1}^{n}\left( W_t-\overline{W}\right) ^2} \end{aligned},$$ (20) $$\begin{aligned}&(1-\hat{\delta }_{YW})\frac{\hat{\alpha }_{YW}+2}{\hat{\alpha }_{YW}(\hat{\alpha }_{YW}+1)(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})}=\overline{W}\end{aligned},$$ (21) $$\mbox{and}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \begin{aligned}&\frac{A}{(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW}^2)\hat{\alpha }_{YW}(\hat{\alpha }_{YW}+1)(\hat{\alpha }_{YW}+2)}&=\hat{\gamma }(0), \end{aligned}$$ (22) where$$\begin{aligned} A&=\hat{\lambda }_{YW}(\hat{\lambda }_{YW}+1)\overline{W}\hat{\alpha }_{YW}(\hat{\alpha }_{YW}+1)(\hat{\alpha }_{YW}+2)\\&\quad +(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})\overline{W}\left( (1-(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})\overline{W})\hat{\alpha }_{YW}^3 +(5-3(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})\overline{W})\hat{\alpha }_{YW}^2\right) \\ {}&\quad +(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})\overline{W}\left( (10-2(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})\overline{W})\hat{\alpha }_{YW}+6\right) . \end{aligned}$$From Eq. (20), we obtain$$\begin{aligned} (1-\hat{\delta }_{YW})&=\frac{\hat{\alpha }_{YW}(\hat{\alpha }_{YW}+1)(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})}{\hat{\alpha }_{YW}+2}\overline{W}. \end{aligned}$$ (23) Using Eqs. (21) and (22), the following cubic equation is obtained:$$\begin{aligned} c_1\hat{\alpha }_{YW}^3+c_2\hat{\alpha }_{YW}^2+c_3\hat{\alpha }_{YW}+c_4=0, \end{aligned}$$ (24) where$$\begin{aligned} c_1&=\left[ \hat{\lambda }_{YW}(\hat{\lambda }_{YW}+1)+ (1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})(1-(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})\overline{W})\right] \overline{W}-(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW}^2)\hat{\gamma }(0),\\ c_2&=\left[ 3\hat{\lambda }_{YW}(\hat{\lambda }_{YW}+1)+ (1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})(5-3(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})\overline{W})\right] \overline{W}-3(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW}^2)\hat{\gamma }(0),\\ c_3&=\left[ 2\hat{\lambda }_{YW}(\hat{\lambda }_{YW}+1)+ (1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})(10-2(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})\overline{W})\right] \overline{W}-2(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW}^2)\hat{\gamma }(0),\\ \mbox{and}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ c_4&=6(1-\hat{\lambda }_{YW})\overline{W}.\\ \end{aligned}$$R packages for solving polynomial equations, particularly the cubic equation, abound. In “Yule–Walker approach” of this study, polyroot R function is used to obtain the roots of Eq. (23) after the coefficients have been calculated from the given time series. Though the equation has three roots, only the root that gives an acceptable value of \(\hat{\delta }_{YW}\) will be used for further computations.Approach to conditional least squares estimationConsider the process in Eq. (12). Let \(\hat{\varvec{\xi }}_{\text {CLS}}=\left( \hat{\lambda }_{CLS}, \hat{\delta }_{CLS} , \hat{\alpha }_{CLS}\right) ^T\) be the vector of the conditional least squares (CLS) estimators of \({\varvec{\xi }_{\text {CLS}}}=\left( {\lambda }_{CLS}, {\delta }_{CLS} , {\alpha }_{CLS}\right) ^T\). Then$$\begin{aligned} \hat{\varvec{\xi }}_{\text {CLS}}=\underset{\varvec{\xi }}{\text {argmin}}(C_n(\varvec{\xi })), \end{aligned}$$where \(C_n(\varvec{\xi })=\sum _{t=s+1}^n\left( W_t-\lambda W_{t-s}-(1-\delta ) \frac{\alpha +2}{\alpha (\alpha +1)}\right) ^2.\)Here, it is necessary to obtain and equate each of \(\frac{\partial C_n( \varvec{\xi })}{\partial \lambda } \big \vert _{\lambda =\hat{\lambda }_{CLS},~ \delta =\hat{\delta }_{CLS},~ \alpha =\hat{\alpha }_{CLS}},\), \(\frac{\partial C_n( \varvec{\xi })}{\partial \delta } \big \vert _{\lambda =\hat{\lambda }_{CLS},~ \delta =\hat{\delta }_{CLS},~ \alpha =\hat{\alpha }_{CLS}}\) and \(\frac{\partial C_n(\varvec{\xi })}{\partial \alpha }\big \vert _{\lambda =\hat{\lambda }_{CLS},~ \delta =\hat{\delta }_{CLS},~ \alpha =\hat{\alpha }_{CLS}}\) to zero, leading to the following equations, respectively:$$\begin{aligned} \displaystyle \sum _{t=s+1}^nW_t W_{t-s}-\displaystyle \sum _{t=s+1}^n W_{t-s}^2-(1-\hat{\delta }_{\text {CLS}}) \frac{\hat{\alpha }_{\text {CLS}}+2}{\hat{\alpha }_{\text {CLS}} (\hat{\alpha }_{\text {CLS}}+1)}\displaystyle \sum _{t=s+1}^n W_{t-s}&=0; \end{aligned}$$ (25) $$\begin{aligned} \displaystyle \sum _{t=s+1}^nW_t -\hat{\lambda }_{\text {CLS}} \displaystyle \sum _{t=s+1}^n W_{t-s}-(n-s)(1-\hat{\delta }_{\text {CLS}}) \frac{\hat{\alpha }_{\text {CLS}}+2}{\hat{\alpha }_{\text {CLS}} (\hat{\alpha }_{\text {CLS}}+1)}&=0; \end{aligned}$$ (26) $$\begin{aligned} \displaystyle \sum _{t=s+1}^nW_t -\hat{\lambda }_{\text {CLS}} \displaystyle \sum _{t=s+1}^n W_{t-s}-(n-s)(1-\hat{\delta }_{\text {CLS}}) \frac{\hat{\alpha }_{\text {CLS}}+2}{\hat{\alpha }_{\text {CLS}} (\hat{\alpha }_{\text {CLS}}+1)}&=0. \end{aligned}$$ (27) Equations (26) and (27) are identical. Hence, we solve for \(\hat{\lambda }_{\text {CLS}}\) using Eqs. (25) and (26). The concerned estimator has the form:$$\begin{aligned} \hat{\lambda }_{\text {CLS}}=\frac{(n-s)\sum _{t=s+1}^nW_t W_{t-s}-\sum _{t=s+1}^nW_t \sum _{t=s+1}^n W_{t-s}}{(n-s)\sum _{t=s+1}^n W_{t-s}^2-\left( \sum _{t=s+1}^n W_{t-s}\right) ^2}. \end{aligned}$$ (28) Suppose \(C_n(\delta , \alpha )\) is a function obtained when we substitute \(\hat{\lambda }_{\text {CLS}}\) for \({\lambda }\) in \(C_n(\varvec{\xi })\). We minimize \(C_n(\delta , \alpha )\) in order to find \(\hat{\delta }_{\text {CLS}}\) and \(\hat{\alpha }_{\text {CLS}}\). The minimization process is done using a suitable numerical method. To summarize, no closed form expression can be found for any of \(\hat{\delta }_{\text {CLS}}\) and \(\hat{\alpha }_{\text {CLS}}\).Conditional maximum likelihood estimationIn view of the s-step Markovian property of the seasonal INAR(1)\(_s\)ZMPL process, we define the transition probabilities as$$\begin{aligned} P_{xy}&=P\left( X_t=y \big \vert X_{t-s}=x \right) \\&=P\left( \lambda *X_{t-s}+\nu _t=y \big \vert X_{t-s}=x \right) \\&=\sum _{r=0}^{y}P(\lambda *x=r)P(\nu _t=y-r).\\ \end{aligned}$$Using this we can write the detailed transition probabilities as$$\begin{aligned} P_{xy}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \displaystyle \delta +(1-\delta )\frac{\alpha ^2(\alpha +2)}{(\alpha +1)^3}, &{}\text{ if }~~~x=0,~~y=0,\\ \displaystyle (1-\delta )\frac{\alpha ^2(y+\alpha +2)}{(\alpha +1)^{y+3}},&{}\text{ if }~~~x=0,~~y\ge 1, \\ \displaystyle \frac{1}{(1+\lambda )^x}\bigg (\delta +(1-\delta )\frac{\alpha ^2(\alpha +2)}{(\alpha +1)^3} \bigg ),&{}\text{ if }~~~x\ge 1,~~y=0, \\ \displaystyle \left( {\begin{array}{c}x+y-1\\ y\end{array}}\right) \frac{\lambda ^y}{(1+\lambda )^{x+y}}\bigg (\delta +(1-\delta )\frac{\alpha ^2(\alpha +2)}{(\alpha +1)^3}\bigg )\\ \displaystyle + \sum _{r=0}^{y-1} \left( {\begin{array}{c}x+r-1\\ r\end{array}}\right) \frac{\lambda ^r}{(1+\lambda )^{x+r}}\\ \displaystyle \times \bigg (\delta +(1-\delta )\frac{\alpha ^2(y-r+\alpha +2)}{(\alpha +1)^{(y-r+3)}} \bigg ) &{}\text{ if }~~~x\ge 1,~~y\ge 1. \end{array} \right. \end{aligned}$$ (29) Let \(\hat{\varvec{\xi }}_{\text {CML}}\) be the conditional maximum likelihood(CML) estimator of \({\varvec{\xi }}\). To find \(\hat{\varvec{\xi }}_{\text {CML}}\), maximize the conditional log-likelihood function below:$$\begin{aligned} l(\varvec{\xi })=\displaystyle \sum _{t=s+1}^n \text {log} P\left( X_t=x_t \big \vert X_{t-s}=x_{t-s}\right) . \end{aligned}$$Obviously, \(\hat{\varvec{\xi }}_{\text {CML}}\) has no closed form. Furthermore, the required estimators can only be found through a numerical technique.Simulation study for the INAR\((1)_{s}\)ZMPLIn this section, we have carried out a simulation study to assess the performance of the proposed estimation methods for INAR\((1)_{s}\)ZMPL process, paying attention to the cases of zero-inflation, overdispersion, zero-deflation and underdispersion baesd on the INAR\((1)_{s}\)ZMPL process. We have simulated 1000 series of the sample sizes 100, 300, 500 and 1000 for various parameter combinations and for seasonal period \(s=52\). We have computed the mean and the mean squared errors (MSEs) of the estimates over all the 1000 simulations. All the quantities are given in the Table 2, the first row for each parameter and sample size (n) combination represents the mean estimate and second row represents the MSE. From the table, it can be seen that the MSE is decreasing with the increase in sample size, indicating the consistency of the estimates. The numerical optimization of the likelihood function to obtain CML estimates is done using the function ‘constrOptim’ in R software. In our setup, constraints are imposed on all the parameters. In particular, the upper limit of \(\delta\) is 1 while its lower limit is a negative quantity that is a function of \(\alpha\). These constraints are considered while numerical optimization using ‘constrOptim’. In all, CML estimates correspond to minimum MSEs compared to the YW and CLS estimates.Table 2 Parameter estimates and their mean squared errors.Full size tableModel-based forecastingTime series models are usually constructed with a view to forecasting future values of time series data. In the case of INAR\((1)_{s}ZMPL\) process, we handle the problem of forecasting a future observation \(W_{n+h}, h \in \mathbb {N}\) using the information \(\mathscr {F}_n\) available upto time n. From Eq. (12), we deduce using induction and properties of the NBT that$$\begin{aligned} W_{n+h} \overset{\text {d}}{=} \lambda ^q*W_{n+h-qs}+\displaystyle \sum _{j=0}^{q-1} \lambda ^q* \nu _{n+h-js}, \quad h\in \mathbb {N}^+, \end{aligned}$$ (30) where \(\overset{\text {d}}{=}\) implies equality in distribution, \(q=\lceil \frac{h}{s}\rceil\) is the integer part of \(\frac{h}{s}\). That is \(\lceil y \rceil =\text {min}\left[ n \in \mathbb {N}^+ \big \vert y \le n \right]\). We round off this section with the following proposition. Proposition 3.4 Consider the INAR(1)\(_s\) ZMPL process in Eq. (12). Then (a) The h-step conditional expectation is$$\begin{aligned} \text {E}\left( W_{n+h} \big \vert \mathscr {F}_n\right) = \lambda ^q \left( W_{n+h-qs}-\text {E}\left( W_t\right) \right) +\mu _\nu . \end{aligned}$$ (b) The h-step conditional variance is$$\begin{aligned} \text {Var}\left( W_{n+h} \big \vert \mathscr {F}_n\right)&= (1+\lambda )\frac{\lambda ^{q}\left( 1-\lambda ^{q}\right) }{1-\lambda }W_{n+h-qs} \\ {}&\quad +\frac{\lambda (1+\lambda )}{1-\lambda } \left( \frac{1-\lambda ^{2(q-1)}}{1-\lambda ^{2}}-\frac{\lambda ^{(q-1)}\left( 1-\lambda ^{(q-1)}\right) }{1-\lambda }\right) \mu _\nu \\ {}&\quad +\left( \frac{1-\lambda ^{2q}}{1-\lambda ^2}\right) \sigma _\nu ^2. \end{aligned}$$ (c) \(\lim \nolimits _{q \rightarrow \infty } \text {E}\left( W_{n+h} \big \vert \mathscr {F}_n\right) = \text {E}\left( W_t \right) .\) (d) \(\lim \nolimits _{q \rightarrow \infty } \text {Var}\left( W_{n+h} \big \vert \mathscr {F}_n\right) = \text {Var}\left( W_t \right) .\) It is not difficult to prove Proposition 3.4 using knowledge of the proofs of Propositions 3.1 to 3.2 and Eq. (30). Therefore, we omit the proof of Proposition 3.4. The h-step ahead forecast can be written as$$\begin{aligned} \hat{W}_{n+h}=\hat{\lambda }^q\left( \hat{W}_{n+h-qs}- \hat{\mu }_W\right) +\hat{\mu }_\nu . \end{aligned}$$Model comparison with seasonal ARIMAIn this section, we have compared the forecast performance of the proposed model and its counterpart \(SARIMA(0,0,0)(1,0,0)_{s}\) model. Here, we have simulated 1000 series each of size 500 from the INAR(1)\(_s\) ZMPL model with various parameter combinations given in Table 3 and the seasonal period \(s=52\). For each series, the first 495 observations are used for the estimation of the parameters and last five observations are used to check the forecast accuracy. We have used three forecast accuracy measures to assess the forecast performance of the model. These measures include prediction root mean squared error (PRMSE), prediction mean absolute error (PMAE) and percentage of true prediction (PTP). Notably,$$\begin{aligned} PRMSE(k)= \sqrt{\frac{1}{m}\sum \limits _{i=1}^{m}\left( X_{(t+i)}-\hat{X}_{(t+i)}^{(k)}\right) ^2}, \end{aligned}$$where \(\hat{X}_{(t+i)}^{(k)}=\widehat{mean}(X_{t+i}|X_{t-k+i})\) is the k-step ahead conditional mean of the fitted process,$$\begin{aligned} PMAE(k)=\frac{1}{m}\sum \limits _{i=1}^{m}| X_{(t+i)}-\hat{X}_{(t+i)}^{(k)}|, \end{aligned}$$where \(\hat{X}_{(t+i)}^{(k)}=\widehat{median}(X_{t+i}|X_{t-k+i})\) is the k-step ahead conditional median of the fitted process, and$$\begin{aligned} PTP(k)=\frac{1}{m}\sum \limits _{i=1}^{m}I\Big (X_{(t+i)}=\hat{X}_{(t+i)}^{(k)}\Big )\times 100\%, \end{aligned}$$where \(I(\cdot )\) denotes the indicator function. Here, \(X_{(t+i)}\) is the actual ith observation at time point \((t + i)\) and \(\hat{X}_{(t+i)}^{(k)}\) is the k-step ahead forecast value at the same time point.We have obtained the conditional mean of the process as traditional forecast while the median and mode from one-step ahead forecast distribution serve as coherent forecasts. For the computation of PMAE in the SARIMA model, we have used mean forecast while in the INAR(1)\(_s\) ZMPL model, we have used the median of the one-step ahead forecast distribution. In the SARIMA model, we can have only mean as the forecast, for computation of percentage of true prediction (PTP) based on mean we have considered rounded mean for both models. We have computed median and mode from the forecast distribution for the computation of PTP-Med and PTP-Mode. In INAR literature, the median and mode of the forecast distribution are called the coherent forecasts.From Table 3, it can be seen that in terms of PRMSE both models perform equally well, as their forecasts are the same. However, the PMAE for the SARIMA model is higher than that of the PMAE for the proposed model, showing the better performance of the proposed model than the SARIMA model. This may be because median is used in the proposed model and mean is used in the SARIMA model for the computation of the PMAE. But when it comes to the coherent forecast performance, the proposed model outperforms the SARIMA model, which can be seen from the PTP for median and mode. When data are overdispersed, as it is the case in the top panel in the table, the coherent forecast performs five times better than the traditional forecast. Both models perform equally well when the data are underdispersed.Table 3 Forecast comparison with SARIMA.Full size tableApplication of INAR(1)\(_s\)ZMPL modelWe have analyzed weekly Influenza data from the Breisgau- Hochschwarzwald county of Baden–Württemberg state, Germany for the years 2001 to 2008 (https://survstat.rki.de). The data have mean 0.4735 and variance 2.5969. Clearly the data are overdispersed. From the relative frequency plot in Fig. 2, we can see that the number of zeros in the data is excessively high. Hence, this series can be modeled using the proposed zero-modified model. The seasonality of the data can be seen from the ACF and PACF plot in Fig. 3, as it is characterized by the sinusoidal autocorrelation pattern. Also, the data are seasonal because the corresponding ACF plot has significant peaks at multiples of 54. From Fig. 4, it can be seen that the AIC and BIC values are small for the period \(s=54\). Hence the seasonal period of the series (\(s=54\)) is confirmed.Figure 2Relative frequency plot for the influenza data.Full size imageFigure 3Sample path and sample ACF influenza data.Full size imageFigure 4Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for influenza data for various seasonal periods ‘s’.

We have obtained point forecast using the INAR(1)\(_s\)ZMPL model for the given data. The data has 416 observations. We have used 411 observations (training data) for estimating the parameters and last five observations are predicted using the fitted model. We have used the conditional ‘h’ step ahead mean as the forecast function. The parameter estimates (CML) based on training data are \(\hat{\lambda }=0.2497\), \(\hat{\alpha }=0.5289\), \(\hat{\delta }=0.8619\). The mean forecast \(\hat{X}_{t+h}\) and the rounded mean forecast [\(\hat{X}_{t+h}\)] are given in the Table 5. From this table it can be seen that the model predicts the future observations with good accuracy.Table 5 Point forecasts for the influenza data.Full size tableConclusionIn this paper, we have introduced a seasonal, nonnegative, integer-valued autoregressive model, with multiple features, using the negative binomial thinning operator and zero-modified Poisson-Lindley distributed innovations. General seasonal INAR model of order P has been discussed in the paper and it has been illustrated in detail for order one. This model, denoted by INAR(1)\(_s\)ZMPL model, is the first of its kind for modeling zero-deflated or zero-inflated seasonal time series of counts. Some theoretical results are determined for the model. Specifically, means, variances and autocorrelation function are obtained. In estimating the parameters of the model, the Yule-Walker, conditional least squares and conditional maximum likelihood approaches are given due consideration. The simulation results obtained in this study demonstrate the superiority of the conditional maximum likelihood method over the other two point estimation methods of estimating the model parameters. A real-life application of the model was investigated by analyzing a zero-inflated overdispersed seasonal count time series. The model fit was compared to the fits of three competing models. In the final analysis, the proposed model outperforms the other models.

Health Published: December 15, 2023 4:46 pm Their kids got the flu — then they couldn’t walk by Alena Maschke Hadley Westmoreland, 8, sits in the dining area of the pediatric unit at Our Lady of Lourdes Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Lafayette, La., on Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. Photo by Alena Maschke When Erika Westmoreland’s daughter Hadley said she couldn’t walk after Westmoreland picked her up from choir practice Monday afternoon, the 48-year-old mother of four thought maybe she was being a little dramatic. But that changed when she saw her daughter crawl to the bathroom. “She literally couldn’t move,” Westmoreland remembers. The 8-year-old had battled a second bout with the flu in just over a month, after the family had waited for a flu vaccine to become available at their pediatrician’s office. At first, the symptoms seemed similar to the first infection, but after a few days, Hadley started feeling a tightness in her legs that prevented her from standing or walking. This lesser known symptom of a flu infection is caused by a condition called acute viral myositis, an inflammation of the muscles that causes them to feel extremely tense, making movement painful. Hadley Westmoreland, 8, looks at the monitor of her IV at Our Lady of Lourdes Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Lafayette, La., on Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. Photo by Alena Maschke. Usually, the condition occurs among patients who undergo intense physical stress in preparation for an athletic competition, for example, but it is also a fairly common side effect of an infection with Influenza B, a flu strain that is becoming more common at this point of the flu season. According to Dr. Kali Broussard, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist with Our Lady of Lourdes Health System, roughly 20% of children infected with Influenza B experience some level of muscle inflammation. While most cases aren’t harmful to children’s health in the long run if treated appropriately, very severe cases can lead to kidney failure, which is why it’s important for parents to take precautionary measures and seek treatment immediately when they notice their children experiencing those symptoms. “At the first sign of illness, when the fever starts, that’s when [parents] should be pushing hydration,” Broussard said, noting the minimum level of hydration to help prevent inflammation is one ounce per two pounds of body weight per day. Inflammation and fever-reducing medications such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen can help make children feel more comfortable, making it easier for them to consume the recommended dose of fluids. For the proper dose, Broussard urges parents to contact their pediatrician, as dosing recommendations on the packaging of the medication often underdose and might not provide the appropriate level of relief. Hadley Westmoreland, 8, continues to have her enzyme levels monitored at Our Lady of Lourdes Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Lafayette, La., on Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023, after flu symptoms left her unable to walk.

In cases like Hadley’s, where symptoms are severe, Broussard said parents should contact their pediatrician or seek out medical care at a hospital, where staff can provide fluids intravenously and monitor enzyme levels in the child’s blood to ensure the inflammation goes down before it can cause damage to the kidneys. Tamiflu can also help reduce symptoms, including muscle inflammation, and is recommended for babies and children older than 2 weeks. But the most important thing parents can do to protect their children is to get them vaccinated, Broussard said. South Louisiana, she noted, has the highest rates of flu infections in the state, making it more likely for children here to experience these symptoms. “That is, unfortunately, a testament to our low flu vaccine uptake,” Broussard said. “That’s why we’re hearing more about it is because more of our kids are sick than everywhere else.” Erika Westmoreland and her daughter talk in the dining area of the pediatric unit at Our Lady of Lourdes Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Lafayette, La., on Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. Photo by Alena Maschke. While a flu shot does not fully protect against infection, it helps reduce the severity of the illness, making it less likely for vaccinated children to experience the debilitating symptoms Hadley had to endure. When Stephanie Mire’s daughter was unable to walk after a flu infection, she panicked. “My husband and I made eye contact across the living room, like alright, this is not normal. Is it a brain tumor?” Mire remembers the fear she felt at the time. Her daughter Reese recovered after being treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids at the emergency room, but the incident left a lasting impression on Mire. While she said flu shots weren’t usually a part of her family’s vaccination routine, she’s considering them now. “It’s definitely a conversation I’ll be having with her pediatrician,” Mire said.

Photo by Alena Maschke. Flu shots, lots of hydration, as well as anti-viral and anti-inflammatory medications can help prevent and lessen some of the worst symptoms, Broussard said. In addition, she advised parents not to send their children back to school until the infection has run its full course, to prevent spreading the virus. Although most children recover well, the dangers of the flu should not be underestimated, Broussard warned. During last year’s flu season, 106 children and adolescents died of the flu, according to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control. “Influenza is not a benign infection, right? Kids do die of influenza,” she said. “Which is kind of wild, considering we have a perfectly good way to prevent it.” Share: E-Mail Facebook Reddit LinkedIn Share using app Posted on December 15, 2023 4:46 pm Section: Health About Alena Maschke Alena covers health in Acadiana for The Current and The Acadiana Advocate.

Key messages Several viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens are expected to continue co-circulating at variable levels during the coming months, and contribute to increased morbidity and mortality during this period. This is typical of every winter season. Widespread implementation of non-pharmaceutical measures during the COVID-19 pandemic led to very low circulation of both viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens which resulted in reduced population immunity. This may exacerbate the respiratory disease burden this winter, particularly amongst those with few or no pre-existing exposures, such as young children. Primary care consultation rates for respiratory illness monitored through established sentinel surveillance systems have been gradually increasing as expected in the EU/EEA since September 2023. Of 23 countries using the Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) thresholds, Influenza-like-illness (ILI) rates were above baseline levels in five countries and Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) rates were above baseline levels in three countries. Rates of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) monitored through sentinel surveillance at hospital sites reported by six countries remain at or below rates observed at the same time last year. SARS-CoV-2 has continued to circulate at higher levels than seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with severe disease predominantly affecting those aged 65 years and above. RSV activity has been steadily increasing over the past week, with the highest burden among children aged 0–4 years. Seasonal influenza activity remained at a low level, although some countries report that they observe increased influenza activity and geographical spread. Influenza activity is expected to increase in the coming weeks, although it is not yet possible to determine how severe this season will be and whether currently available vaccines will be well matched with circulating strains. Since October 2023, increases in respiratory infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae were reported by six EU/EEA countries [1-5]. M. pneumoniae is not notifiable in most EU/EEA countries, leading to limited available information regarding diagnosed cases, proportion of detections amongst respiratory laboratory samples, or historical detection data. As a result, country-level or historic comparisons should be made with caution. Following substantial increases in all-cause mortality levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, all-cause mortality in Europe (both for the total population and in all age groups) returned to expected, pre- pandemic levels by spring 2023. Currently, pooled estimates of all-cause mortality show that all-age mortality is at baseline, with an elevated level of mortality observed in the age group of 65 years and above. This age-specific increase in mortality is in line with historic increases observed at this time of year. Member States should prepare for the possible need to increase emergency department and ICU capacity (in terms of adequate staffing and bed capacity), for both adult and paediatric hospitals. Hospital administrators and managers should ensure that resources, such as medicalursing staff and equipment, are also available. Ensuring healthcare staff are trained to implement appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures will contribute to reducing the burden in healthcare settings and avoid outbreaks within these settings, including in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Clinicians should be reminded that, when indicated, the early use of antiviral treatments for COVID-19 and influenza may prevent progression to severe disease in vulnerable groups. RSV prophylaxis for infants can be considered in accordance with national guidelines. It remains essential for Member States to continue developing, strengthening and sustaining resilient population-based integrated surveillance systems, including genomic surveillance, for influenza, COVID- 19, and potentially other respiratory virus infections (such as RSV or new viral diseases of public health concern). Monitoring severe disease burden through hospital surveillance systems using SARI case definitions remains critical to assess the burden. Active promotion of vaccinations against seasonal influenza, COVID-19 and RSV in accordance with national recommendations is already ongoing and should continue in all Member States. Vaccination remains the most effective measure for preventing COVID-19 and influenza infection from progressing to severe disease. For more effective promotion of vaccination uptake of the recommended vaccines, countries can consider the ‘5Cs diagnostic model for vaccination’ (Confidence, Complacency, Constraints, Collective Responsibility and Calculation). Risk communication activities for the public should be implemented, including targeted guidance for risk groups, healthcare workers and caretakers of vulnerable groups. Key recommendations include vaccination according to national recommendations, staying home when ill, respiratory etiquette and good hand hygiene, appropriate ventilation of indoor spaces, and promotion of appropriate public health and social measures (PHSM) (also called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)). People with high risk for severe disease (as well as their caretakers and close contacts) should consider using a face mask when in crowded public spaces. Global situation This report describes the current epidemiological situation of acute respiratory infections in the EU/EEA countries and provides updated ECDC recommendations for mitigating their impact. Countries in the northern hemisphere experience winter surges of acute respiratory infections caused by several pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, RSV, and other seasonal virus and bacteria. The co-circulation of these pathogens increases pressure on healthcare systems, with outbreaks of respiratory infection leading to increased primary care consultations and hospitalisations, particularly for patients with comorbidities and risk factors for severe outcomes. Influenza and RSV have caused the greatest seasonal impact in terms of morbidity, mortality, and work/school absenteeism in interpandemic years, whereas SARS-CoV-2 caused the largest impact between 2020 and 2023 without a clear seasonal pattern. Increasing trends of several respiratory pathogens are currently being documented in various countries across the northern hemisphere. Since early autumn 2023, seasonal flu activity and flu hospital admissions continue to increase in most parts of the United States and Canada [6,7]. Additionally, the United States has observed a modest increase in childhood pneumonia cases due to a range of respiratory pathogens, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae. However, overall rates of pneumonia are currently largely consistent with pre-pandemic years [8]. In early November, China reported a nationwide increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases, primarily affecting children and attributed to the co-circulation of multiple known pathogens, particularly M. pneumoniae [9]. According to information shared in a press conference held on 10 December 2023 [10], the overall volume of diagnosis and treatment of children's respiratory diseases in the country was decreasing, thereby reducing the burden on paediatric hospitals. There was an increase in recent weeks in rates of influenza-like illness in sentinel hospitals across China [11], however, levels were below the peaks observed in the winter of 2022/2023. An increase in M. pneumoniae infections to levels similar to pre-pandemic seasons has also been observed in South Korea[12]. Increases in ILI have also been reported from Japan, with an earlier start of the season compared to previous years (including pre-pandemic seasons) [13]. Epidemiological situation in the EU/EEA as of week 48 As outlined in the guidance document ‘Operational considerations for respiratory virus surveillance in Europe’ [14], ECDC performs integrated surveillance of influenza, COVID-19, and other respiratory virus infections in the EU/EEA. Representative sentinel surveillance systems in primary and secondary care based on well-defined case definitions (ILI/ARI/SARI) are the central component of acute respiratory infection surveillance. ECDC publishes routinely collected data weekly through the European Respiratory Virus Surveillance Summary (ERVISS) [15]. Additionally, countries are encouraged to report unusual events or clusters of respiratory infections not monitored by routine surveillance through EpiPulse. Respiratory virus activity in the community Medical consultation rates for respiratory illness have been increasing in primary care settings since September. Of 23 countries using the Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) thresholds to detect significant upsurges in week 48, ILI rates were above baseline levels in five countries (Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Latvia, Luxembourg) and ARI rates were above baseline levels in three countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania). This indicates respiratory pathogen activity of low to medium level in a subset of EU/EEA countries. In week 48, test positivity data for patients presenting to primary care sentinel sites showed that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating at higher levels than RSV and seasonal influenza (Figure 1). Figure 1. Aggregate weekly sentinel primary care pooled test positivity for seasonal influenza, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 in the EU/EEA, week 25/2023-week 48/2023* * Number of countries reporting data can vary between reporting weeks. In week 48, 14 countries reported data for SARS-CoV-2, 15 countries reported for influenza and 12 countries reported data for RSV. Please see ERVISS for more information on number of countries reporting every week [15]. The proportion of acute respiratory infections due to SARS-CoV-2 has remained high (above 10%) since week 25, with a slight upward trend since week 40. In week 48, the pooled test positivity in primary care was 24% (median 19%, data from 14 countries) (Figure 1). At the country level, increasing and decreasing trends for SARS-CoV-2 test positivity were observed during this period, indicating regional variability. It is important to note that sentinel system sizes and testing numbers vary significantly between countries, influencing the precision of the trend analyses. These figures are however consistent with SARS-CoV-2 detections observed among respiratory specimens collected outside of the surveillance sentinel sites. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, infections due to the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been consistently increasing in the past few weeks. At EU/EEA level, the pooled test positivity in primary care was 11% (median 3%, data from 12 countries) in week 48 [15]. Overall, RSV circulation intensified later than the previous year and positivity is still at less than half the maximum reached last year. Seasonal influenza activity remains at a low level, although qualitative assessments made by countries indicate increasing intensity of influenza activity and geographical spread in a number of countries [15]. Overall, the pooled test positivity in primary care was 4% in week 48 (median 3%, data from 15 countries), with three countries (Estonia, Greece, Lithuania) exceeding 10% test positivity in sentinel primary care. All three influenza virus types/subtypes (A(H1)pdm09, A(H3) and B) are co-circulating. It is not yet possible to determine whether these initial increases represent the start of the 2023/24 influenza season as there isn’t a clear dominant virus subtype, nor sustained increases confirmed for a sufficient number of weeks. Surveillance of severe disease Rates of SARI cases are comparable to those observed during the same period last year. Two countries (Germany and Spain) have reported increases in SARI rates in the past three weeks in the 0–4-year-old age group. However, current data availability regarding disease severity from SARI systems is limited, as only six countries have reported syndromic SARI data to ECDC since week 40/2023. Additionally, it is important to note that reporting delays in SARI data are expected, as some information related to cases may only be available after discharge and clinical data collection can often include resource-intensive elements [16]. An increase in pooled SARS-CoV-2 test positivity among SARI cases were observed between week 29 and week 44 in people aged 15–64 years and in those 65 years and above, with a mixed picture at the country level (six countries reporting data) (Figure 2). However, a decreasing trend has been observed for these age groups since week 44, which may be partially attributed to reporting delays. At the EU/EEA level, non-sentinel COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU rates and mortality rates have gradually increased since week 36, mirroring the data reported from sentinel systems (Figure 3). The decreasing trend observed in non-sentinel COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU rates and mortality rates over the last one to two weeks is most likely also attributable to delayed reporting. Figure 2. Proportion of COVID-19 cases among people hospitalised with severe infections by age group, weeks 25-48/2023 * *Number of countries reporting data can vary between reporting weeks. In week 48, 4 (Ireland, Germany, Malta, Spain) countries reported data for SARS-CoV-2 shown in the figure above. Note that data from Ireland is for cases ≥15 years of age. Figure 3. Rate of severe COVID-19 cases, by week, age and clinical outcome (non-sentinel sources), week 25/2023-week 48/2023* *Number of countries reporting data can vary between reporting weeks and between age groups. In week 48 for total age group, 11 countries reported data for SARS-CoV-2 hospital admissions, 10 countries reported data for ICU admissions and 16 countries reported data on deaths. Increasing trends in RSV test positivity were observed in two (Germany and Spain) out of four countries reporting RSV data from SARI systems over the past three weeks (Figure 4). Test positivity reached a plateau in the last week which is most likely due to a reporting delay. Test positivity remains highest for the 0–4 years age group (60%), and the 5–14 years age group (12%). Non-sentinel RSV hospital admissions remained high in the 0–4- years age group in two (Ireland and Malta) out of four countries reporting data in week 48. Figure 4. Proportion of samples positive for RSV among patients with severe respiratory infections, by age group, weeks 25-48/2023* *Number of countries reporting data can vary between reporting weeks. In week 48, 4 (Ireland, Germany, Malta, Spain) countries reported data for SARS-CoV-2 shown in the figure above. Note that data from Ireland is for cases ≥15 years of age. In week 48, test positivity for seasonal influenza in sentinel SARI systems remains low at 3%. Non-sentinel hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths due to influenza also remain low. Analysis of all-cause mortality data in Europe is conducted by EuroMOMO [17]. Following substantial increases in all-cause mortality levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, all-cause mortality in Europe (both for the total population and in all age groups) returned to expected, pre-pandemic levels by spring 2023. In week 48, 2023, pooled estimates of all-cause mortality for 25 participating European countries or subnational regions showed that all-age mortality was at a baseline, with an elevated level of mortality observed in the age group of 65 years and above. This age-specific increase in mortality is in line with historic increases observed at this time of the year [17]. It is important to note that all-cause mortality can be influenced by multiple factors unrelated to outcomes due to communicable disease, such as environmental factors, which include extreme weather conditions. Virological surveillance data ECDC works closely with WHO to compare assessments and classifications of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. The aim of classification is to communicate information about variants which emerge that may impact the epidemiological situation. ECDC and WHO utilise three categories of variant classification with increasing levels of concern: variant under monitoring (VUM), variant of interest (VOI) and variant of concern (VOC). WHO updated its variant classification criteria in March 2023 (with a minor modification in October) [18]. The classification used by WHO is closely aligned with that used by ECDC [19]. Both organisations focus on classification that includes major evolutionary steps, with a more specific focus on variants requiring major public health interventions. The distribution of these variants is displayed in ERVISS [15]. For the two-week period to week 47, 2023, the estimated distribution (median proportions from 16 countries) of variants of concern (VOCs) or variants of interest (VOIs) was 51% for XBB.1.5+F456L, 26% for BA.2.86 and 6% for XBB.1.5. The proportion of BA.2.86 has been growing, with XBB.1.5-like+F456L and XBB.1.5 showing a decreasing trend. All three influenza virus types/subtypes (A(H1)pdm09, A(H3) and B) are co-circulating, currently. So far, influenza A subtypes are predominant in sentinel and non-sentinel virological surveillance data. During weeks 40–48, 2023, 83 A(H1)pdm09, 34 A(H3) and six B/Victoria viruses from sentinel and non-sentinel sources were genetically characterised. Of the A(H1)pdm09 viruses, 38 were reported as clade 5a.2a and 45 were subclade 5a.2a.1 which is the clade included in the northern hemisphere 2023/24 influenza season. Of the A(H3) viruses, one was reported as clade 2a.3a and 33 were subclade 2a.3a.1, which is different from the northern hemisphere vaccine component and similar to the new virus recommended for inclusion in the 2024 southern hemisphere influenza season vaccines. All the B/Victoria viruses were reported as subclade V1A.3a.2 which is the clade included in the northern hemisphere influenza season. Given current low levels of influenza circulation, it is not possible to confirm how the distribution of circulating influenza types and subtypes will evolve, nor which strains or clades will dominate later this winter. WHO recommends that trivalent vaccines for use in the 2023/24 influenza season in the northern hemisphere contain the following (egg-based and cell culture or recombinant-based vaccines respectively): an A/Victoria/4897/2022 or A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (subclade 5a.2a.1); an A/Darwin/9/2021 or A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus (clade 2a); and a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus (subclade V1A.3a.2) [20]. Other pathogens Several other respiratory pathogens are expected to co-circulate during the coming winter months, contributing to increased morbidity. These can include a range of viruses (such as adenoviruses, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses and seasonal coronaviruses) and bacteria (such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Bordetella pertussis). Some of these circulate throughout the year with no strong seasonal trend, while others may have more seasonal patterns and their prevalence can vary with seasons. For pathogens not under routine surveillance in EU/EEA countries, it is difficult to make an EU-wide assessment of their specific impact. When assessing increases in transmission of other pathogens it should be noted that this period follows the widespread implementation of non-pharmaceutical measures and the very low circulation of respiratory pathogens during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in reduced population immunity, particularly amongst those with little or no pre-existing exposures, such as young children. Concurrent resurgence of pathogens that have circulated at lower levels in recent years may contribute additional pressures on healthcare systems this winter. Since October 2023, increases in respiratory infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae were reported by six EU/EEA countries [1-5]. M. pneumoniae is not notifiable in most EU/EEA countries, leading to limited available information regarding diagnosed cases, proportion of detections amongst respiratory laboratory samples, or historical detection data. As a result, country-level or historic comparisons should be made with caution. M. pneumoniae epidemics occur cyclically in Europe every one to three years [21]. Various factors contribute to this cyclical pattern, such as the decline of population immunity over time or the introduction of new strains into the population. The reported increases are observed following a three-year period of very limited transmission and detection of M. pneumoniae in the EU/EEA during the pandemic and the caveats mentioned above. There are currently no reports of atypical M. pneumoniae strains or resistance to first-line macrolide antibiotics from reporting countries in the EU/EEA. Testing, monitoring and reporting EU/EEA Member States are encouraged to establish and expand well-designed, representative population-based surveillance in primary and secondary care to monitor trends in transmission and severe disease. This is outlined in the guidance document, ‘Operational considerations for respiratory virus surveillance in Europe’ [14]. Non-sentinel data are valuable complementary data and should continue to be reported if possible. The most up-to-date surveillance data should be reported to the European Surveillance System (TESSy) on a weekly basis, according to the published reporting protocol [22]. In addition to routine reporting through TESSy, it remains crucial that countries report unusual events or clusters of respiratory infections through EpiPulse. Considering the current reports of elevated detections of M. pneumoniae in several EU/EEA countries, it remains important to monitor the occurrence of atypical and/or severe forms of disease, or evidence of resistance to antibiotics. Any such information should be reported through EpiPulse. Currently, only a limited number of countries in the EU/EEA routinely report syndromic SARI and pathogen detection data from secondary care sentinel sites. Secondary care data from representative networks of hospital sites based on established SARI case definitions provide extremely valuable information on severe disease. A number of EU/EEA countries participate in the European SARI Surveillance Network (E-SARI-Net), which aims to strengthen SARI surveillance systems. Member States are encouraged to establish or improve reporting from such systems. Data from hospital laboratories and registry systems currently provide important complementary data and remain essential to assess severe disease while sustainable sentinel systems are being established and expanded. Where possible, testing for other pathogens, like RSV, should be included in the ARI and SARI sentinel surveillance systems as effective integrated respiratory surveillance systems should provide sufficient data to monitor the intensity of circulation and spread of respiratory viruses, helping to guide control measures and mitigate their impact. As the clinical spectrum for COVID-19, RSV infection, and other respiratory virus infections does not always include high temperature, the ARI case definition is more sensitive than ILI for integrated sentinel surveillance [14]. Countries that choose to extend to ARI are strongly encouraged to continue to collect the number of consultations from ILI patients, to allow the use of the more specific ILI syndromic indicator for monitoring influenza activity and calculation of epidemic thresholds with historical data. A representative subset of upper respiratory specimens from patients with respiratory symptoms (ARI/ILI/SARI) via primary and secondary care sentinel surveillance should be tested for respiratory pathogens (influenza, SARS-CoV- 2 and others). RT-PCR is the gold standard for laboratory testing for respiratory viruses and multiplex tests are available that can simultaneously test for multiple pathogens (including bacteria). Culture and serology are also used in clinical practice to diagnose other respiratory pathogens, for example serology is used to diagnose M.pneumoniae infections. Self-testing using Rapid Antigen Detection Tests (RADTs) can also be used to quickly detect COVID-19, influenza and/or RSV and ensure appropriate treatment (i.e. antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza) and the implementation of other public health actions when appropriate. For further details on testing, monitoring and reporting, please refer to the guidance document on integrated Operational considerations for respiratory virus surveillance in Europe [14]. Recommendations for public health actions Vaccination Vaccination remains the most effective measure for preventing COVID-19 and influenza infection from progressing to severe disease. COVID-19 ECDC recommends that COVID-19 vaccination campaigns for the coming months focus on protecting those aged over 60 years and other vulnerable individuals irrespective of age (such as those individuals with underlying comorbidities and individuals with immunocompromised conditions) [25]. In addition, vaccination of healthcare workers should be considered because of their likely increased risk of exposure to new waves of SARS-CoV-2 and their key role in the functioning of healthcare systems [25,26]. Mathematical modelling performed in 2023 indicated that an autumn 2023 vaccination campaign (with an optimistic scenario of high vaccine uptake among individuals aged 60 years and above) was expected to prevent an estimated 21–32% of the cumulative total all-age COVID-19 related hospitalisations across EU/EEA countries until 28 February 2024. [27]. Almost all EU/EEA countries have issued recommendations for autumn 2023 vaccination campaigns, were initiated from September 2023 in some countries. The age cut-offs of national recommendations differ between countries ranging from 50 to 65 years, with COVID-19 vaccination usually recommended to the same age groups as the annual influenza vaccination. Other high-risk groups for which vaccination is recommended include persons aged six months and older with underlying diseases (i.e. chronic respiratory, cardiovascular, liver and kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, chronic neurological disease, immunosuppression) and residents in long-term care facilities. Preliminary data from the Member State autumn campaigns [28-33] indicate a wide variation in uptake in the recommended age-groups, ranging from 20% to over 70% for one country. In order to maximise uptake among target groups, countries should carefully consider factors that have previously limited booster vaccine uptake. Communication campaigns providing clear information through trusted people and channels on which groups vaccination is recommended for, why vaccination is important, and the appropriate timing of doses are all key to improving vaccine uptake. Campaigns should also include engagement with healthcare workers, as they are trusted sources regarding information on vaccination. Strategies to facilitate access to vaccination services should also be considered. Influenza ECDC recommends promotion of the annual influenza vaccination according to national recommendations, as it remains the single most effective measure for preventing infection and development of severe disease among the elderly and persons with underlying medical conditions. High-risk groups for severe disease include the elderly, children aged six months to four years, pregnant women regardless of trimester, immunosuppressed individuals or people with chronic medical conditions [34,35]. All EU/EEA countries have recommendations targeting older adults, as well as groups with underlying medical conditions [36]. Healthcare workers should be encouraged to receive vaccination against influenza to reduce the risk of infecting vulnerable groups, in addition to protecting themselves. Influenza vaccination campaigns are underway in the EU/EEA and target groups should be encouraged to be vaccinated. To maximise uptake, similar approaches as for the promotion of COVID-19 vaccination should be applied. Several countries are running combined campaigns against COVID-19 and influenza, since this approach could be more efficient in terms of administration, logistics and cost. Data for seasonal influenza vaccine uptake will be available later in the season. RSV Two RSV vaccines (Abrysvo™ [37] and Arexvy™ [38]) for the prevention of disease in older adults and infants through maternal vaccination have been granted marketing authorisation for use in the EU/EEA. Assessment of evidence is ongoing or planned in EU/EEA countries for inclusion in routine vaccination programmes, following NITAG advice and cost-effectiveness analyses. To date, three countries [39-41] in the EU/EEA have issued recommendations for use of RSV vaccine in older adults (60+ or 75+ years of age according to national recommendations). IPC measures and management of cases Strengthening appropriate IPC practices mitigates the spread of respiratory viruses in both the community and healthcare facilities. During the current high community virus transmission period, it is advised that in addition to appropriate hand and respiratory hygiene, staff, visitors and patients in both primary and secondary healthcare settings wear medical face masks (universal masking) or FFP2 respirators in common areas of the hospital, patient rooms and other areas where patient care is provided. Implementation of multi-layered interventions is the key to preventing strain on hospital personnel and other resources [42]. In healthcare facilities, the mainstay of IPC comprises a set of measures always used by healthcare workers including administrative measures (such as triage and placement of patients, in this case patients with respiratory symptoms), healthcare precautions (especially hand hygiene), appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by HCWs and environmental measures (such as cleaning and ventilation). Rapid tests for the early detection of COVID-19, influenza and RSV, and testing in general for viruses, facilitates both the management of patient admissions and appropriate room and bed allocation in accordance with IPC recommendations as well as their treatment. Ideally, patients with confirmed respiratory viral infection, or probable respiratory viral infection with confirmatory test results pending, should be placed in a single room. If the number of cases exceeds the single-room capacity, patients with the same viral infection can be placed in the same room (cohorting). Alternatively, healthcare workers in contact with patients should wear a medical face mask during all routine patient care (targeted clinical masking). Decisions on implementation of universal or targeted clinical masking should consider the expected benefit, as well as the burden on resources, staff, patients and visitors. Healthcare facilities should ensure that PPE is available and appropriately used to safeguard staff providing patient care. A risk assessment should be conducted to support appropriate selection of PPE. It is recommended that healthcare workers interacting with patients who have viral respiratory infections, without close proximity or long exposure to the patient, should wear a medical face mask, as a minimum. Clinicians should consider early diagnosis and treatment, when indicated, to prevent progression to severe disease. Antiviral drugs are available and approved in EU/EEA for the treatment of COVID-19 within five days from the onset of symptoms (nirmatrelviritonavir (Paxlovid™), remdesivir and monoclonal antibodies) and influenza, preferably within 48hrs from the onset of symptoms (oseltamivir, zanamivir and baloxavir). Antibiotics can be used to treat respiratory infections caused by bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection or other bacteria, when patients present with prolonged or atypical, severe lower respiratory tract symptoms, and based on medical evaluation. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses and guidance for the prudent use of antibiotics should be included in awareness campaign(s). In 2022, nirsevimab, a recombinant human monoclonal antibody was authorised for EU/EEA countries as a one-off injection ahead of the RSV season [23] and indicated the prevention of RSV disease in neonates and infants. Some EU/EEA countries including France [43], Luxembourg [44] and Spain [45] have issued recommendations for its use. For RSV, no prevention measure was available before, except palivizumab [46], a monoclonal antibody for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infections in high-risk groups. The combination of increased hospital visits/admissions and high numbers of staff being infected with circulating viruses may exert enormous pressure on healthcare systems around Europe in the coming weeks. Maintaining an adequate ratio of staff to patients, especially in adult and paediatric emergency departments and ICUs is critical for patient safety and quality of care. Appropriate measures to alleviate understaffing in critical units should be taken by prioritising and allocating resources effectively according to the foreseeable needs. Risk communication Generally, good hygiene practices in the community should be promoted, including targeted guidance for risk groups, healthcare workers and caretakers of vulnerable groups. Messaging should include vaccination promotion, staying home when ill; good hand and respiratory hygiene, appropriate ventilation of indoor spaces. The use of medical face mask (as a minimum) when in crowded public spaces can also be promoted, particularly for people at high risk for severe disease from circulating viruses, or people with respiratory symptoms who cannot stay home. Reports from some countries indicate relatively low COVID-19 vaccine uptake in the 65+ age group (ranging between 20-73%) [29,30]. Regarding vaccination, it is important to understand the reasons for suboptimal levels of acceptance and uptake of both seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. Member States may consider using the ‘5Cs diagnostic model for vaccination’ to understand the factors that may be addressed through risk communication. The 5Cs stand for Confidence, Complacency, Constraints, Collective Responsibility and Calculation, all of which can be amenable to risk communication messaging. The 5Cs model is translated into all 24 official EU languages [47]. Five additional key areas may be considered in risk communication messages in the context of promoting vaccination uptake: Vaccines in use today have been updated to provide protection against currently circulating subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses and are expected to protect against development of severe disease. At this stage, there is an overwhelming body of evidence in support of the safety and effectiveness of COVID- 19 and influenza vaccines. Every effort should be made to ensure that the messengers used in risk communication activities are known and trusted by the target populations. Messages should provide clear instructions regarding where and how people can be vaccinated. In countries where recommendations for the new RSV vaccine are introduced, extra efforts should be made to promote this vaccine for the identified risk groups.

Flu: A ‘much more serious threat,’ new study into long-term risks concludesBYCarolyn BarberThe new study found worse health outcomes in individuals months after their initial infection with COVID-19.Dan Kitwood—Getty ImagesAlmost from the start of SARS-CoV-2’s rampage around the globe, researchers and epidemiologists warned that it appeared to behave differently than known viruses, particularly seasonal flu. That included not only COVID-19’s general contagiousness compared to flu viruses, but also its ability to cause clotting problems in the veins and arteries, result in loss of smell and/or taste, and even lead to a rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. That message was taken more or less seriously, depending on geography and, often, politics. But as a new study makes clear, the warnings have proved darkly prophetic. The study, a comparative analysis with 18 months of follow-up of hospital admissions for those with COVID-19 and those with seasonal flu, found that COVID-19 patients experienced significantly higher rates of death, healthcare utilization, and adverse health outcomes in most organ systems than did patients with the flu. Its results were published on Dec. 14 in the infectious diseases section of the medical journal The Lancet. ‘A multi-systemic disease’ “This was evident in pre-Delta, Delta, and Omicron (strains), and evident in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals,” says Ziyad Al-Aly, the director of the Clinical Epidemiology Center, chief of research and development service at the Veterans Affairs Saint Louis Health Care System, and senior author of the study. “COVID remains a much more serious threat to human health than the flu.” The study arrives as the U.S. is seeing a significant uptick in COVID-related hospitalizations and with 15 states reporting high or very high levels of respiratory illness, which takes in COVID-19, the flu, RSV, and other respiratory diseases. The hospitalization numbers are well below those posted during Omicron’s peak, but with colder weather moving more people indoors and into crowded settings, they may reasonably be expected to continue rising. Al-Aly’s study undertook a comparative analysis of 94 pre-specified health outcomes and found that over 18 months of follow-up, COVID was associated with a “significantly increased risk” for 64 of them, or nearly 70%. The disease’s enhanced risk list includes everything from cardiac arrest, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and cognitive impairment to mental health and fatigue, two characteristics often associated with long COVID. By comparison, the seasonal flu was associated with increased risk in only six of the 94 conditions specified. Further, while COVID increased the risks for almost all the organ systems studied, the flu heightened risk primarily for the pulmonary(lung) system. Those findings, Al-Aly says, suggest that “COVID is really a multi-systemic disease, and flu is more a respiratory virus.” ‘A formidable foe’ Though COVID poses a greater risk, the seasonal flu should continue to be taken seriously, the researcher says. In fact, one clear finding of the study is that, much in the same way that long COVID is much more of a health problem than acute COVID, long flu poses more danger than does its acute phase. “Five years ago, it wouldn’t have occurred to me to examine the possibility of a ‘long flu,’” Al-Aly says. “But a major lesson we learned from SARS-CoV-2 is that an infection which was initially thought to only cause brief illness can also lead to chronic disease. Conceptualizing the illness as an acute event obscures the much larger burden of health loss that occurs later. This revelation motivated us to look at long-term outcomes of COVID-19 versus flu.” The result: COVID-19 poses a much higher risk, both in the short run and long term, than flu. But the flu remains “a formidable foe,” Al-Aly says. “Going into this winter season where cases of COVID and flu are rising, people should make sure they are vaccinated for both, and for RSV if they qualify, and take precautions to lower their risk.” According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), nearly 80% of adult Americans have completed their primary series of COVID-19 vaccines, but only 17% have received a booster. Meanwhile, nearly four in 10 adults had received a seasonal flu shot as of Nov. 25, the CDC estimated. Roughly 15% of all U.S. adults have experienced long COVID symptoms, though figures range as high as the reported 34% in Oklahoma. According to a paper published earlier this year by Al-Aly’s team in Nature Medicine, the physical fallout from long COVID may last two years or longer–and it can take a toll on the quality of life even for those whose initial cases didn’t require hospital care. ‘We trivialize COVID infections at our peril’ Clearly, long COVID remains a looming threat. Moreover, research shows that with each successive COVID-19 infection, we roll the dice. One can be young, healthy, and vaccinated, having experienced only mild symptoms during initial infections–then, almost inexplicably, develop long COVID on the next infection. Considering that long COVID can include conditions like memory loss, new diabetes, stroke, etc, and we have no proven treatments, the best strategy is to avoid it altogether. Al-Aly’s study mined the databases of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to analyze data for more than 80,000 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals between March 2020 and June 2022, and for nearly 11,000 flu patients between October 2015 and February 2019. Up to 18 months of follow-up for participants was chosen “to comparatively evaluate risks and burdens of death” in addition to the pre-specified health outcomes, organ systems, hospital readmission, and admission to intensive care, the study says. As part of their analysis, the researchers composited the health outcomes into 10 organ systems: cardiovascular, coagulation and hematological, fatigue, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, metabolic, musculoskeletal, neurological, and pulmonary. COVID-19 showed increased risk in nine of the 10, with the flu showing increased risk only in the pulmonary system. The COVID group also had a higher risk of admission to intensive care in all of the time periods studied (30, 180, 360, and 540 days) versus the flu group, as well as a higher risk of readmission to the hospital. And absolute rates of death, adverse health outcomes, and healthcare utilization, while high for both viruses, were “significantly higher for COVID-19 compared to seasonal influenza,” despite changes in SARS-CoV-2 over time from pre-Delta to Delta to Omicron, the researchers said. The study’s authors noted two key limitations. First, the V.A. study population is predominantly older white males, which may limit the generalizability of the study’s findings. And as the researchers assessed only people who were hospitalized with COVID or flu, the results should not be extrapolated to include non-hospitalized individuals. Another strain of the virus, JN.1, has been detected. The growth advantage it appears to have over other variants suggests that it is either more transmissible or more capable of evading our immune systems. And the specter of long COVID hangs over each infection, to some degree or other. “We trivialize COVID infections at our peril,” says Al-Aly. “The objective evidence is clear, whether it is a first infection or reinfection, COVID is still a serious threat to human health.” Carolyn Barber, M.D., is an internationally published science and medical writer and a 25-year emergency physician.

Studies conducted in the UK, where children are routinely vaccinated against the virus, have shown a 94% drop in children's clinic visits, with positive effects on adult health. By WALLA! DECEMBER 10, 2023 20:11 A highly contagious viral disease. Influenza virus (photo credit: SHUTTERSTOCK) Many people mistakenly believe that the flu is just a mild cold or a winter ailment. However, the Health Ministry emphasizes that influenza is a highly contagious and severe viral disease.The flu virus spreads through coughing, sneezing, and contact with nasal secretions and phlegm, which contain a multitude of viruses.The infection rate for flu is alarmingly high. It primarily affects the respiratory tract and results in symptoms such as fever (over 38 degrees Celsius), sore throat, headache, runny nose, cough, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Pneumonia is a common complication of the flu, often requiring hospitalization for vulnerable groups such as young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. To combat this, the Health Ministry recommends flu vaccination for everyone over the age of 6 months. The flu vaccines provide effective protection for one winter season.Each year, a new vaccine formulation is produced containing the four strains of influenza expected to be prevalent in the upcoming year.The UK's flu program (or is it a programme?)To understand the effectiveness of the flu vaccine, let's examine the situation in the UK. The UK is at the forefront of childhood flu vaccination in the Western world and has implemented a systematic program to vaccinate children in schools for several years. Yes, even if you are already sick. (man with a cold) (credit: SHUTTERSTOCK)The vaccination takes place before winter using a nasal spray. Numerous studies conducted in the UK have not only shown a high response rate to the vaccine, but also significant effectiveness in reducing the spread of the virus and the risk of hospitalization.According to the latest report published in July, which assesses the vaccine's effectiveness annually, there was a two-thirds decrease in the risk of hospitalization among children aged 2-17 who were vaccinated against the flu. Most of these children received the nasal spray vaccine.This year's report, unlike previous seasons, primarily focuses on the dangers of the flu and its potential complications. It examines the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing hospitalizations in children, whereas previous reports analyzed various parameters such as clinic visits or flu-like symptoms. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now The UK recognizes that school students are particularly susceptible to the flu and act as major spreaders of the disease in the community. Consequently, the flu vaccination program in schools has been expanded throughout the UK for children aged 4-17.It's important to note that influenza is a complex disease that undergoes changes each season, presenting three to four different strains every winter. Therefore, revaccination is crucial, even if you or your child have already been exposed to the flu.Exposure to one strain does not guarantee protection against other strains. Only through vaccination can the body generate natural antibodies against the specific flu strains identified by the World Health Organization as the cause of the disease. Man with flu working in the office (credit: INGIMAGE)However, it's worth mentioning that vaccine effectiveness typically ranges between 50-75%. In some years, when the estimated vaccine strains do not match the actual flu strains, the effectiveness may fall below 50%. A study conducted during the 2020-2021 flu season in Denmark found high effectiveness (ranging from 66% among children aged 2-6 to 72% among children and adolescents aged 2-17) of the nasal spray vaccine.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags winter Vaccinations Coronavirus Hot Opinion Change the climate: Israel’s environmental potential at COP29 and regional impact By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

The study was led by Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, the chief of research and development at the VA St. Louis Health Care System and a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University. Al-Aly has been studying long COVID for the past 3 years, and has been interested in studying the differences between the acute and chronic phases of the disease. "With COVID, we first thought if the disease as an acute respiratory illness, but long COVID has raised the public's understating that viral infections can lead to chronic conditions," he told CIDRAP News. "We know Epstein-Barr virus can cause multiple sclerosis; we see post-Ebola conditions develop in survivors; polio infections lead to conditions that appear decades later." Is COVID truly just like flu? Al-Aly said the natural comparisons made between COVID-19 and seasonal flu made him eager to understand if influenza infections—those significant enough to require hospitalization—also result in a long-term burden of disease, a "long flu." Especially after Omicron, you heard people saying COVID is like the flu, or COVID is more of a threat, less of a threat, etcetera. "Especially after Omicron, you heard people saying COVID is like the flu, or COVID is more of a threat, less of a threat, etcetera," Al-Aly said. When doing a review of the scientific literature, Al-Aly said he found studies comparing COVID and flu outcomes in the short term, only up to 6 months. In the new study, Al-Aly and his team looked at data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs to assess risk of death, 94 individual health outcomes, the overall burden across all organ systems, hospital readmission, and admission to intensive care units among two groups: 81,280 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2022, and 10,985 patients hospitalized for seasonal flu from Oct 1, 2015, to Feb 28, 2019. They assessed outcomes for 18 months. COVID patients had 50% higher risk of death Across all time periods, COVID-19 patients had a greater risk of death than seasonal flu patients, at 0 to 30 days (hazard ratio [HR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.28 to 2.78), 0 to 180 days (HR 1.86), 0 to 360 days (HR 1.61), and 0 to 540 days (HR 1.51). At 18 months, the cumulative death rate for COVID patients was 28.46 per 100 persons, compared with 19.84 per 100 persons for seasonal influenza. Among the 94 health outcomes assessed in the study, patients who had seasonal flu were more likely to suffer from six outcomes: angina, tachycardia, type 1 diabetes, and three of four pre-specified pulmonary outcomes. Al-Aly said influenza patients, more than COVID patients, suffered from poor respiratory outcomes. "It seems flu is a more of a respiratory disease, while COVID is a multi-systemic illness; more organs are at risk," Al-Aly said. But over and over, the study showed outcomes were worse for COVID patients, which Al-Aly said pushes back against the narrative that, in the post-Omicron era, COVID is no more threatening than the flu. COVID 'much more of a health threat' "A lot of people trivialize COVID, but even with the mellowing of Omicron, and vaccination, COVID is still much more of a health threat compared to flu," Al-Aly said. "The burden of health loss and burden of disease in post-acute or long phase of the disease is significant." The COVID-19 group had a higher risk of hospital readmission than the seasonal flu cohort (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.13). And, except for the pulmonary system, COVID patients saw adverse health outcomes across all organ systems at a rate of 615.18 per 100 persons, compared with 536.90 per 100 persons in the seasonal influenza group. It's critical to note that the health risks were higher after the first 30 days of infection. "It's critical to note that the health risks were higher after the first 30 days of infection," Al-Aly said in a Washington University news release. "Many people think they're over COVID-19 or the flu after being discharged from the hospital. That may be true for some people. But our research shows that both viruses can cause long-haul illness." In a commentary on the study, Monica Gandhi, MD, of the University of California–San Francisco, writes that the findings add to the understanding of post-acute health complications. "The most important finding of this study is the high rate of health outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and those admitted to hospital with seasonal influenza," Gandhi writes. "The work by Al-Aly and colleagues, along with that of others, argues for comprehensive studies into the pathophysiology of post-viral syndromes," she adds. "Along with investigation of non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical treatments for post-viral syndromes."

Here's when to see a doctor, stay home amid tripledemic warnings - ABC7 New York 24/7 LiveNew York CityNew JerseyLong IslandNorthern SuburbsConnecticutWelcome, Mickeymickey@disney.comManage MyDisney AccountLog Out HEALTH & FITNESSRSV, flu and COVID-19: How can you tell the difference? Doctor explainsByPamela Parker Tuesday, December 12, 2023How to tell the difference between RSV, flu and COVID-19Health workers are preparing for a possible "tripledemic" of flu, COVID-19, and RSV this winter. Here's how to tell the difference.SAN FRANCISCO -- Health workers are preparing for a possible "tripledemic" this holiday season of influenza (flu), COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These have many of the same symptoms in common, and it is hard to tell which one you've caught.We talked to Dr. David Hoffman, pediatric hospitalist at MarinHealth Medical Center, to share his insights on how to tell them apart and when you should and shouldn't worry."While it's impossible to know for sure which one of these viruses you have without testing, there are some distinctive symptoms for each virus," Dr. Hoffman said.Here are some symptoms of each and a guide on what to do if you or a family member is falling sick.InfluenzaOverviewThe flu typically comes on very suddenly with an incubation period of one to four days, unlike COVID-19, which tends to have a gradual onset of symptoms. Typically, people feel more miserable with the flu than with other types of viruses, and it often comes with a sore throat, nausea, body aches, vomiting, or even diarrhea. A distinctive sign of the flu can be a very high fever -- as high as 103 or 104 Fahrenheit. Fever is just the body's way of fighting the infection and is not dangerous in and of itself.Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, said, "Hospitalizations for flu continue to be the highest we've seen for this time of year in a decade. If you do get sick, present yourself to your provider for early care. There are good antivirals to treat both flu and COVID-19."The CDC is again suggesting people voluntarily wear masks indoors to reduce their chances of getting sick in the next few weeks.It's not too late to get both vaccines - experts say you start getting protection within a week with a booster.Distinctive characteristicThe most distinctive sign of the flu can be a very high fever in the 103 to 104 range.Flu symptoms include:FeverChillsHeadacheRunny noseNauseaFatigueLoss of appetiteSore throatCOVID-19Overview"The coronavirus has become familiar to most of us, and the signs are similar to flu and RSV. To complicate it further, some people become very ill, while others have very mild symptoms, and others show no symptoms at all. While most people develop symptoms within the first week after exposure, symptoms can occur from two up to 14 days after exposure to the virus."Distinctive characteristic"Unlike other viruses, COVID-19 can affect other areas of the body outside of the lungs and, in some instances, cause long-term effects," Dr Hoffman says.COVID-19 symptoms include:CoughBrief feverShortness of breathAbdominal painLoss of taste or smellCongestionFatigueSore ThroatNausea or vomitingDiarrheaMuscle or body achesHeadacheRSVOverviewRSV is a virus that many adults would have already caught and it generally just causes cold symptoms for adults. "If you think back to that cold that you got that just wouldn't go away, you kept having congestion and perhaps a cough that lasted longer than usual, there's a decent chance that that was RSV. And again, symptoms of flu can include fever, chills, headache, runny nose, or congestion, nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite and sore throat," Dr. Hoffman said.RSV causes a runny nose, congestion, and cough for most people. According to Dr. Hoffman, RSV has a greater likelihood of causing severe illness in very young children, especially those born premature or who have lung disease or heart disease. The most distinctive symptom that some children infected with RSV will exhibit is wheezing. Wheezing is a high-pitched sound with each exhalation."For most people, and even most kids, RSV doesn't cause a dangerous illness. But it does in a subset of kids. Even kids with significant illness that require hospitalization are usually going to do just fine. Maybe they'll need a little bit of oxygen, maybe they just need to be watched closely. RSV is most likely to cause significant or, you know, more concerning illness in very young children and very old adults," Dr. Hoffman said.MORE: Everything you need to know about RSV symptoms, treatments, shotsFor the first time this year, RSV vaccines are available.For adults over age 60, there are two vaccines. For babies under 8 months old, there are two monoclonal antibody shots available, which are a bit different than a vaccine but still provide protection.Certain babies and toddlers between 8 months and 19 months entering their second RSV season are recommended to receive an antibody shot.There is also a maternal RSV vaccine, which is given to pregnant mothers in the third trimester between 32 weeks' and 36 week's gestation.Distinctive symptom The most distinctive symptom that some children infected with RSV will exhibit is wheezing, a high-pitched sound, with each exhalation.RSV symptoms include:Runny noseDecreased appetiteCoughingSneezingFeverWheezingWhen to see a doctorDr Hoffman says to seek medical care right away if these symptoms appear:Trouble breathing Pain or pressure in the chestNew confusionInability to wake up or stay awakeBluish lips or faceSevere abdominal painRefusing to eat and drinkWhen should I keep my child home?If your child is exhibiting any symptoms of RSV, flu, or COVID-19, health experts advise you to keep your child home from school to avoid spreading the virus to other people. It doesn't matter which of the viruses is the culprit. Caution should be taken to prevent the spread.Prevention: How to keep your child from getting sickPrevention is the best medicine, particularly with these viruses. These suggestions are good ideas to avoid seasonal viruses:Get your child vaccinated for flu, COVID-19, RSV, pneumococcus, and pertussis.Wash your hands regularly or use hand sanitizer.Sanitize high-contact surfaces, such as desks, tables, and doorknobs, if someone in your household is sick.If your child is sick, have them stay home to avoid spreading the illness."Everyone's talking about RSV but we do see other viruses in the community as well, like metapneumovirus, which can cause bronchitis or significant respiratory infection, or viral pneumonia. There are thousands of viruses that we don't have tests for so we don't know exactly which virus it is, but we're definitely seeing more of many different respiratory infections," Dr Hoffman said.He says the most important message he wants to impart to parents is you can do a lot more harm to yourself by being overly concerned."By being anxious and increasing stress, you therefore are making yourself more susceptible to all types of illness, chronic disease, and infection,' Dr. Hoffman says."That said, I do think that everyone should do whatever they can do to protect themselves from all of the respiratory illnesses and other vaccine preventable illnesses out there. He encouraged all pregnant mothers to get their pertussis vaccines during their pregnancy to 'cocoon' their unborn child, and preventing by preventing themselves from getting pertussis," he says.Similarly, he urged kids to get the pneumococcal vaccine (whooping cough)."Get the COVID-19 and flu vaccine for kids and adults. The flu vaccine will make you perhaps feel like you have a very mild cold but that's a lot better than getting seriously ill, or even dying from influenza. So a lot of people choose not to get the flu vaccine because they don't like that. But really the benefits are much greater than the very small risks of getting the flu vaccine or the inconvenience of getting the flu vaccine," Dr. Hoffman said."I don't think that it's a great idea to rush to your pediatrician's office or your primary care provider's office just to get tested, to try and figure out which one of these you have, aside from perhaps doing COVID-19 testing because most people who get RSV and flu and COVID-19 are going to do just fine. And so it's really only about dictating whether or not you need to isolate strictly and for how long," he said.The fact is that these respiratory viruses tend to crop up with similar symptoms, such as cough, runny nose, and fever. Fortunately for most children, it doesn't matter which of these, or the thousands of other viruses causing respiratory illnesses or colds, your child has. Most children will recover from all of these viruses on their own, without receiving medical treatment and without serious complications. If your child is sick, consider testing for COVID-19 first to inform if and how long you need to isolate your child at home.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 WABC-TV.

Murphy On 27 November 2023, the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reported the first known human case of influenza A (H1N2)v in the UK, a variant of the influenza virus previously not known to cause infections in humans. Following detection, public health agencies in the UK are now working rapidly towards characterizing the pathogen and assessing the risk it may present to human health.Several subtypes of the influenza virus are assigned according to combinations of mutations in the proteins on the surface of the virus - hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The former binds to sialic acid receptors in the host. New influenza viruses can emerge through a process called reassortment where the co-infecting viruses could swap genomic fragments. Influenza A H1N2 is a subtype of influenza that is endemic in pigs and is rarely reported in humans. Swine influenza viruses normally do not infect humans, however, in rare cases, sporadic infections can occur especially with close contact with animals carrying the virus. In such occurrences, the infecting influenza strain is known as a “variant virus” denoted by adding “v” after the subtype. The case of influenza A (H1N2)v was detected as part of the comprehensive national influenza surveillance in the UK led by UKHSA. The patient, a 75-year-old individual, who has now fully recovered, presented with mild respiratory and flu-like symptoms. Genome sequencing revealed that the virus belonged to a distinct clade 1B.1.1 of influenza viruses. While distinct from recent human cases of A(H1N2), its genetic makeup showed similarity to swine influenza viruses found in the UK and no other mutations of concern have been detected in this variant. Although the patient resides in an area in proximity to pig farms, no direct contact with animals could be established. Instances of human-to-human transmission of the virus have also not yet been detected, however, the detection of the virus in a case with no contact with animals could possibly mean that a limited and undetected human-to-human transmission may have occurred. “But there is no definitive evidence,” says the WHO.Sporadic human infections with A(H1N2)v have been detected previously. Since 2005, almost 50 cases of human A(H1N2)v infections have been reported from across the world, however, this is the first time that a case has been reported from the UK. Recently in August 2023, a human infection was reported in the United States of America linked to an agricultural fair. Cases have also been reported in Austria, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Brazil, Canada, China and Australia. Infections with H1N2 variant viruses generally are similar in symptoms and severity to seasonal influenza viruses and there is limited evidence of human-to-human transmission. “Current evidence suggests that these swine-origin influenza viruses have limited ability for sustained transmission among humans,” the WHO says. According to the UKHSA, the variant influenza virus presents a low risk to the general public. However, people with direct regular exposure to pigs may be at a higher risk of acquiring this virus. Influenza viruses have the potential to spill over into human populations and cause severe illnesses although the variant virus detected in the UK does not show any characteristics suggestive of pandemic potential. As public health authorities in the UK continue to follow up on the case, it is important to underscore comprehensive surveillance of pathogens, particularly rapidly evolving respiratory viruses like influenza and ability to rapidly characterize viral variants using genome sequencing forms the cornerstone of public health action and preparedness and our ability to mitigate the risk of a global outbreak.(Bani Jolly is a senior scientist at Karkinos Healthcare and Vinod Scaria is a senior consultant at Vishwanath Cancer Care Foundation) Published - December 16, 2023 09:37 pm IST Read Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT Related Topics health Top News Today0 / 0 Read in App The Hindu About Us Code of Editorial Values News Archive Sitemap Print Subscription Digital Subscription Subscribe to Newsletters Rss Feeds Readers Editor-Terms of Reference Authors & Contributors Frame Front page Contact us Contact Us Social Media Advertise With Us Group News Sites Business Line BL on Campus Sportstar Frontline இந்து தமிழ் திசை The Hindu Centre Young World Club The Hindu ePaper Business Line ePaper Crossword + Free Games Other Products RoofandFloor STEP Images Classifieds - Print Bookstore & Special Publications Popular Sections Elections Israeli–Palestinian conflict 2023 Latest News National News International News Videos Life & Style Food Podcast Showcase Opinion Editorial Columns Comment Cartoon Letters Interview Lead Business Agri-Business Industry Economy Markets Budget Sport Cricket Football Hockey Tennis Athletics Motorsport Races Other Sports Sci-Tech Science Technology Health Agriculture Environment Gadgets Internet States Andhra Pradesh Karnataka Kerala Tamil Nadu Telangana Cities Bengaluru Chennai Coimbatore Delhi Hyderabad Kochi Kolkata Kozhikode Madurai Mangaluru Mumbai Puducherry Thiruvananthapuram Tiruchirapalli Vijayawada Visakhapatnam Trending on The Hindu News PM Modi launches projects worth ₹12,850 crore Jio’s Diwali Dhamaka plan Brazil becomes second BRICS country not to join BRI ‘Vijay 69’ trailer Bomb threats to airlines iQOO 13 will get a rear floating halo light Kaala Bhairava Army vehicle was fired upon in Battal area Spanish PM Sanchez arrives in Vadodara Trending on Group sites Stock Market Live Updates Stocks to buy today Hockey Mogun Bagan Paralympics 2024 Gold Rate Today Silver Rate Today Sexual Harassment in Telugu Film Industry Mango: The Michael Jackson of Fruits Frontline Current Issue Terms of Use Privacy Policy Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

By Katia Hetter, CNN 6 minute read Published 8:27 AM EST, Wed December 13, 2023 Link Copied! Video Ad Feedback WATCH: Threat of respiratory illnesses underway, CDC director says 07:39 - Source: CNN CNN — The spread of respiratory illnesses is well underway, as US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Mandy Cohen told Congress recently. She noted the rise of three particular viruses: flu, the coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus, better known as RSV. Hospitalizations for these three viruses continue to increase, according to CDC data. As more people have symptoms such as cough, sneezing and fever, they may wonder if they should get tested to find out exactly which virus is causing their symptoms. What symptoms can be treated at home, and what should prompt someone to seek medical care? Does it matter if you go to the doctor’s office versus urgent care or the emergency room? And if people have not gotten vaccinated yet, is it too late? To assist us with answering these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner. CNN: Is it important for everyone who has a runny nose, cough or fever to get tested to find out exactly what is causing their symptoms? Dr. Leana Wen: No. This is not practical, nor is it necessary. In addition to the “big three” that’s often referenced of influenza, the coronavirus and RSV, there are also many other viruses that cause respiratory illnesses, such as adenovirus, rhinovirus and parainfluenza. By some estimates, there are more than 200 viruses that cause the common cold and produce the symptoms mentioned of runny nose, cough or fever. Most people do not need testing to figure out exactly which virus is causing their symptoms. There are three circumstances under which virus testing may be recommended. First, someone who is vulnerable to severe illness may wish to get tested for influenza and Covid-19. There are several antiviral therapies approved for individuals with influenza, including Tamiflu. According to the CDC, people in priority groups for influenza treatment include those who have severe illness or are at higher risk for influenza complications.

De Jesus/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) Marie D. De Jesus/Houston Chronicle/Getty Images/FILE Why you shouldn’t postpone your flu vaccine Similarly, Paxlovid is an antiviral oral treatment approved to treat individuals early in their course of illness from Covid-19 and who meet eligibility criteria. Other treatments for Covid-19 include the pill molnupiravir and the injection or infusion remdesivir. Individuals at risk for severe disease from the coronavirus should get tested if they have viral symptoms so that they can begin antiviral treatment as soon as their diagnosis is confirmed. Second, someone may wish to get tested to find out if they have influenza or Covid-19 if they live in a household with an individual who is vulnerable to severe disease from these two pathogens. For instance, a healthy child in day care probably doesn’t need to get tested for every sniffle. However, if they live in a household with a grandparent who is on immunosuppressing medications after a kidney transplant, they should get tested more often if they exhibit viral symptoms. That’s because if the child has influenza, the grandparent may be eligible to take prophylactic antiviral medications that reduce their chance of contracting the flu. There are no such prophylactic options for Covid-19, but the grandparent should be on the lookout for symptoms and take antiviral treatments if they contracted the coronavirus. And, of course, the child with viral symptoms should isolate from the grandparent to reduce the chance of spreading the infection. Third, a person may get tested for influenza, Covid-19, RSV and other viruses if they are severely ill or have been ill for a while. This would be part of an evaluation to find out what is causing these prolonged, severe and/or progressive symptoms. For instance, someone who is ill enough to require hospitalization probably would receive a full viral panel as part of their inpatient evaluation. CNN: Is it possible for someone to test positive for more than one virus? Wen: Yes. In a 2019 study, researchers examined more than 44,000 cases of respiratory illnesses in Scotland and tested for 11 viruses, including rhinovirus, coronaviruses, influenza and RSV. Of all patients who tested positive for one virus, 11% had a coinfection with one or more other viruses. Some patients harbored as many as five viruses at the same time. Again, for most people, it’s not important to know exactly what is causing their symptoms. The treatment is generally the same and is referred to as supportive treatment. That means there is no specific antiviral therapy, but rather, symptoms are addressed to help the patient feel better. So, if someone has a fever, they can take fever-reducing agents like Tylenol or ibuprofen. They can drink lots of fluids to prevent dehydration. They can get rest to help with their fatigue. That’s different in the case of influenza and Covid-19 for specific patients who are eligible for antiviral treatment; those are the people for whom testing is most crucial. CNN: What symptoms can be treated at home, and what should prompt someone to seek medical care? Wen: Most people will recover fully with supportive treatment at home. Note that this may take some time; cold symptoms can last more than a week and a cough could linger for months. It's not practical or necessary to test everyone who has a runny nose, cough or fever. But there are specific circumstances that warrant it. Guido Mieth/Digital Vision/Getty Images Symptoms that should prompt seeking medical care include difficulty breathing, severe chest pain, severe vomiting and inability to keep down fluids, and sustained fever. Parents of young children should be on the lookout for struggled breathing as evidenced by signs like nose flaring, wheezing, increased breathing rate and bluish tinged lips. Babies are especially prone to dehydration, and parents and caregivers should contact a medical professional if the child is not making enough wet diapers. Other individuals who should contact their physician earlier in the course of illness are those who are elderly and who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart and lung disease. For these patients, a viral illness that may be mild for most can exacerbate existing conditions and result in hospitalization or worse, and early, proactive monitoring is essential. CNN: When should someone go to the doctor’s office versus urgent care or the emergency room? Wen: Emergency symptoms require emergency care in the ER. These include sudden and severe symptoms like chest pain, struggling to breathe and seizures. On the other hand, symptoms that are continuing over days can generally begin with an evaluation in the doctor’s office. In these situations, you could begin with a call to your physician’s office. They could advise as to whether you could be seen on an urgent basis in the office or via a telehealth visit. They could also advise as to whether you should, instead, go urgent care or the ER.

Francine Orr/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images It’s not too late to get vaccinated, as the holidays – and respiratory virus season – ramp up CNN: Can you remind us what steps people can take to prevent from contracting viruses? Also, if they have not gotten vaccinated yet, is it too late? Wen: It’s not too late to get vaccinated. People who have not had this year’s flu vaccine or the latest Covid-19 vaccine can still get it now, as can those eligible for the RSV vaccine. These vaccines reduce your chance of contracting the virus and, most importantly, decrease your chance of severe illness even if you were to get infected. Other steps to prevent infection include frequent handwashing, staying away from those with cold-like symptoms and mask-wearing in indoor, crowded spaces.

Enhanced surveillance will continue over the coming weeks. From: UK Health Security Agency Published 11 December 2023 The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has published its investigation findings on the recent case of influenza A(H1N2)v. The case was detected as part of routine national flu surveillance undertaken by UKHSA and the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP). The virus was identified by UKHSA on 23 November using genome sequencing, the first time a human case of this particular virus has been confirmed in the UK. Rapid work has been underway to learn more about the virus and its characteristics, including how it may have been acquired and whether it may have spread. There remains only one human case of influenza A(H1N2)v in England. The case was an otherwise well person over 75 years of age, who has recovered fully. Although the virus is similar to those detected in pigs in England and the case lives in a region containing pig farms, no direct contact between the case and any animal was reported. No further cases have been detected through investigations, including follow-up of contacts to date and enhanced surveillance through local GP practices and hospital trusts. Enhanced surveillance will continue over the coming weeks as a precaution. UKHSA Incident Director Dr Meera Chand said: This is the first time we have detected this virus in humans in the UK. Since the virus was confirmed we have been working rapidly to learn more about it and how it might have been acquired. Investigations to date have not identified any further human cases and sporadic cases of influenza from swine viruses are known to occur. The identification of this case highlights the importance of our flu surveillance and genomic sequencing in helping us to identify and learn more about new viruses.

The child tested positive for influenza A and did not have any known underlying health conditions.No further information about the child is being released."The death of a child is a loss for the entire community," Dr. Geoffrey Leung, public health officer for Riverside County, said in a statement. "While such outcomes are uncommon, it reminds us that influenza is not to be taken lightly and we should take steps to protect everyone, especially the most vulnerable among us."The news comes just a few days after Public Health announced two recent flu-related deaths in the county.Influenza activity in Riverside County is moderate, according to public health, and Influenza A is the predominant virus this season.For younger children and older adults, as well as those with certain health conditions, respiratory viruses can cause more severe disease and may require additional medical care.Children experiencing the following warning signs should obtain medical care right away:Fast breathing or trouble breathingBluish lips or faceRibs pulling in with each breathChest painSevere muscle pain (child refuses to walk)Dehydration (no urine for eight hours, dry mouth, no tears when crying)Not alert or interacting when awakeSeizuresFever above 104 degrees Fahrenheit that is not controlled by fever-reducing medicineIn children younger than 12 weeks, any feverFever or cough that improve but then return or worsenWorsening of chronic medical conditionsThe latest flu vaccines are available to everyone 6 months and older. New with this year's recommendations is that anyone with a history of an egg allergy, regardless of severity, may receive any influenza vaccine (egg-based or non-egg-based) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Those who should consult a medical professional about flu vaccines may be immunocompromised, have a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine, children between 2-4 who have received a diagnosis of asthma or people who are pregnant.Appointments can be made by visiting myturn.ca.gov/en_US/flu.html or by contacting your local pharmacy or health care provider.In addition to vaccines, the public can take these steps to protect themselves from flu, COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses:Wash hands thoroughly and frequentlyCover coughs and sneezesKeep children home when sickConsider indoor maskingDisinfect frequently used surfacesFor more information and to access the county's respiratory illnesses dashboard, visit www.ruhealth.org/public-healthespiratory-virusesEma Sasic covers entertainment and health in the Coachella Valley.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Both the flu and COVID-19 can cause lingering health problems, a new study shows. (Image credit: South_agency via Getty Images) People hospitalized for either COVID-19 or the flu face a heightened risk of medical issues, hospital admission and death in the 18 months after they're discharged.That's according to a new study, published Thursday (Dec. 14) in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, that compared the long-term outcomes for patients sickened with either viral infection. Awareness around long COVID — long-term symptoms that persist or newly emerge months to years after an initial COVID-19 infection — has steadily grown since the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 first appeared. But the new study highlights another significant public health burden: what the study authors informally call "long flu."Historically, people have thought of viral illnesses like influenza as mostly transient, or "acute," sicknesses. But that idea doesn't account for the impacts that sometimes linger in the "post-acute" phase, said senior study author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis and chief of the research and education service at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Saint Louis Health Care System. "I think we've ignored this for a long time, and the COVID-19 pandemic kind of put it in the spotlight," Al-Aly told Live Science. As seen with COVID-19, "flu can lead to long-term problems," he said.Related: When should you get a flu shot? What to know for the 2023-2024 flu seasonHowever, when you compare COVID-19 and the flu head-to-head, the long-term risks tied to a COVID-19 hospitalization are more numerous and more severe than those tied to flu, Al-Aly emphasized, although the flu has more profound effects on the respiratory system, specifically.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over."What we saw is that people with COVID-19 had a higher risk of death, hospitalization and sequelae [knock-on effects of disease] than people with the flu," he said. Therefore, "COVID remains a much more serious problem than seasonal influenza." For the new study, Al-Aly and colleagues drew information from VA databases to identify people who'd been hospitalized for either COVID-19 or the flu. They included more than 81,000 people who'd been hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2022, as well as nearly 11,000 people who'd been hospitalized for seasonal flu between October 2015 and February 2019. (The rate of flu hospitalizations was very low between 2020 and 2022, due to precautions taken to reduce COVID-19 spread, so those years weren't included.)Previous studies have compared the lingering effects of COVID-19 and flu out to about six months post-hospitalization — but the researchers wanted to look further, out to 18 months. They looked at the rates of death, hospital admission and intensive care unit (ICU) admission among the study participants, as well as the rates of 94 specific health outcomes related to 10 organ systems. For example, chest pain caused by poor blood flow to the heart (angina) was related to the cardiovascular system, while shortness of breath was related to the respiratory system.RELATED STORIES—Brain fog in long COVID may be linked to blood clots—Could we ever eradicate the flu?—Metformin cuts risk of long COVID by 40% in patients with obesity, trial suggestsThe analysis revealed that the rates of death, medical care and poor health outcomes were "high in both those admitted to hospital for COVID-19 and those admitted to hospital for seasonal influenza," the authors reported. But overall, the risks were substantially higher for those hospitalized with COVID-19.For every 100 people, the COVID-19 group saw about eight to nine additional deaths within the follow-up period compared with the flu group. Similarly, they experienced about 20 more hospital admissions and eight more ICU admissions per 100 people, compared with the flu group. Both COVID-19 and flu came with a risk of various health problems, but COVID-19 affected far more organ systems. COVID-19 was linked to a risk of 64 of the 94 studied symptoms and health conditions, hitting the cardiovascular, neurological and gastrointestinal systems, and more. Influenza was tied to just six: angina, fast heart rate (tachycardia), type 1 diabetes, cough, low blood oxygen and shortness of breath. The latter three symptoms tied to flu are related to the respiratory system, and in fact, the flu carried a higher risk of respiratory effects than COVID-19 through the entire follow-up period. This highlights that "flu is more of a respiratory virus, but COVID is more of a multisystemic illness," Al-Aly said.For all organ systems except gastrointestinal, more than 50% of the health effects occurred more than one month after hospital discharge. This was true for both flu and COVID-19 and highlights the lasting impact both infections can have in the post-acute phase. The new study has several limitations. A major one is that it focused only on people hospitalized for either disease. "This is really a major limitation, that we studied it in this context," so more work is needed to understand how the long-term impacts of milder cases of flu and COVID-19 compare to one another, Al-Aly said. In addition, the VA data were heavily skewed toward older male patients, so there are remaining questions as to how these health burdens affect people of other ages and sexes.With the data at hand, Al-Aly said he hopes the work raises both patients' and health care providers' awareness of the lasting impacts of these diseases.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

Could this be happening with the flu, for example?”To investigate, Al-Aly and colleagues analysed medical records from 81,280 US patients who were hospitalised with Covid and 10,985 who were hospitalised with seasonal influenza, following them for at least 18 months to learn about their risks of death, hospital readmission and 94 different health problems involving the body’s major organ systems.The research, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, found that while Covid patients faced a greater risk of death or hospital readmission in the following 18 months, both infections carried a significant risk of ongoing disability and disease.In both cases, more than half of death and disability occurred in the months after infection as opposed to the first 30 days. And while the symptoms associated with long flu were more likely to centre on the lungs – for example, shortness of breath or a cough – compared with Covid patients, both groups were at greater risk of fatigue, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and neurological issues and symptoms associated with other organ systems in the following months.“Many people think they’re over Covid-19 or the flu after being discharged from the hospital. That may be true for some people. But our research shows that both viruses can cause long-haul illness,” Al-Aly said. “Conceptualising these diseases as acute illnesses is really just looking at the tip of the iceberg, and eclipses the much higher toll of adverse health outcomes that are happening in the post-acute phase.“Some people are ending up with serious long-term health issues. We need to wake up to this reality and stop trivialising viral infections and understand that they are major drivers of chronic diseases.”The study was not designed to identify what proportion of those hospitalised with influenza go on to develop further health problems, or whether certain groups are at higher risk, and this is something the team hope to investigate in the coming months. Also unclear is the extent to which people who get flu but are not hospitalised develop ongoing health issues.For now, Al-Aly said the most important thing was to try to reduce the risk of being hospitalised from these illnesses, through vaccination and, in the case of Covid, antiviral drugs.Explore more on these topicsFluHealthMedical researchLong CovidnewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyUK detects its first human case of swine flu strain 27 Nov 2023Respiratory infection clusters in China not caused by novel virus, says health ministry26 Nov 2023England to deny Covid and flu jabs to under-65s despite fears for NHS this winter8 Aug 2023Flu and pneumonia deaths a quarter higher than usual in England and Wales20 Jan 2023Universal flu vaccine may be available within two years, says scientist25 Nov 2022Flu season in England is worst for a decade, says health secretary9 Jan 2023Ambulance staff reportedly urged to conserve oxygen amid ‘twindemic’30 Dec 2022Flu continues to spread in England with number of hospital patients up 79%30 Dec 2022Most viewedMost viewedUKUK politicsEducationMediaSocietyLawScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The tool allows individuals to browse pharmacy and doctor’s office locations for COVID-19 and flu vaccines directly through the user-friendly locator tool.“VaxAssist is aimed at helping people overcome questions on vaccine eligibility and where they may be able to find locations for COVID-19 and flu vaccinations nearby to help ensure they’re ready for respiratory illness season,” says Cozi Namer, Senior Director, Strategic Initiatives, Pfizer, and lead developer of the new platform. “I’m proud of the team’s collective effort to develop a tool that empowers individuals in their preventative care and aims to reduce the impact of future respiratory illnesses.”Last year, the United States experienced a severe flu outbreak comparable to other severe outbreaks over the last decade.9,10 This was further compounded by widespread RSV and COVID-19 hospitalizations.11 According to the CDC, this “triple-demic” of flu, COVID-19, and RSV caused more than 230,000 emergency room visits among all ages in just a single week during its peak of December 2022.11 One survey showed nearly 40% of U.S. households reported that someone in their household had been infected by one of the viruses during the holidays.12 In addition, it is estimated that over 150,000 hospitalizations from pneumococcal pneumonia occur annually in the U.S.13This year’s CDC outlook indicates that we’ll see similar rates of hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV, and the flu.1 In fact, the total number of hospitalizations is expected to be higher than what we experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the potential to cause significant strain on our healthcare system.1“A significant part of the U.S. population is aged 65 years and above, and these individuals are at higher risk of infection from several common respiratory illnesses," says Erica Chilson, U.S. Respiratory Medical Lead, Pfizer. “Despite increased availability, many eligible individuals still fail to get vaccinated due to accessibility barriers, including uncertainty around what nearby locations are providing vaccinations, alongside fractured information, which we are hoping to alleviate with the launch of VaxAssist.” References 2023-2024 Respiratory Disease Season Outlook – Summary | CDC.

From: UK Health Security Agency Published 15 December 2023 All those eligible for the flu vaccine are being urged to come forward as the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) published data showing a significant increase in the number of recorded flu cases. The latest UKHSA data also shows there has been an increase in emergency department flu attendances and hospital admissions in the last week. So far this year, flu vaccine uptake in eligible groups is similar to the last couple of years, although there is a particular need for pre-schoolers, pregnant women and those in the health and social care workforces to take up the offer. From 4 to 10 December 2023, the UKHSA national influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report showed that: there was a notable increase in influenza positivity to 5.6%, up from 2.4% in the previous week, based on data from Respiratory DataMart primary care surveillance indicated a rise in influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultations to 5.3 per 100,000, compared to 4.6 per 100,000 in the previous week influenza hospitalisations increased, including a rise in emergency department attendances across the country. There was also an uptick in intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) admissions, with 35 new admissions in week 49 weekly influenza vaccine uptake for the 2023 to 2024 season showed higher rates for those aged 2 years, comparable rates for those aged 3 years and lower rates for those aged 65 years and over, pregnant women, and those under 65 years in clinical risk groups compared to the equivalent week in the previous season (2022 to 2023) Those aged 2 and 3 years are eligible for nasal spray flu vaccines, with parents and guardians also urged to book appointments to ensure the younger age group is protected. With both flu and COVID-19 cases both circulating this winter, it is also vital all those eligible get both vaccines as soon as possible. Due to the increase in levels of flu circulating in the community, UKHSA has recommended that it is now appropriate for antiviral medicines to be prescribed in primary care settings. Those eligible for antivirals if they have flu include patients in clinical at-risk groups as well as any who are at risk of severe illness and complications from flu if not treated. This includes people in those groups who present with symptoms of flu and those who have been exposed to flu-like illnesses from someone they live with, including residents of care homes. As has happened in flu seasons before the pandemic, following an UKHSA recommendation, the Chief Medical Officer together with the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer have issued an alert to the NHS notifying the healthcare system that antiviral medicines can now be prescribed and supplied for cases of community acquired influenza. Dr Mary Ramsay, Director for Immunisation and Programmes at UKHSA, said: Flu levels are on the rise, so get your vaccine now to make sure that you are Winter Strong, and before pharmacies and surgeries begin to close for the Christmas period. Pregnant women, their unborn babies and those in clinical risk groups are at higher risk of complication from flu. Taking up both the flu and COVID-19 vaccines provides the best protection for both pregnant women and their baby, reducing the risk of severe complications, intensive care needs, stillbirth, and prematurity. If you are the parent of a child aged 2 or 3 years, don’t forget that they are also eligible for the flu vaccine and this can be booked via your GP – the nasal spray will help prevent hospitalisations, reduce the spread of flu in the community and avoid you having to juggle a sick child with work and other commitments. The NHS national booking system is closed. But eligible persons can still continue to speak to their GP, or alternatively a local pharmacist about getting their vaccination. Flu antivirals are effective in helping to keep people out of hospital and preventing the virus spreading to other more vulnerable household and family members. Now that we are seeing flu increasing it’s important that GPs consider the possibility of flu in respiratory patients and the use of antivirals in line with national guidance, particularly if they have ruled out COVID-19. You can help reduce the spread of these infections by avoiding mixing with others where possible when showing signs of a respiratory illness like flu and COVID-19, particularly those who are more vulnerable. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Thomas Waite said: The latest data indicates the flu season is very much underway and COVID-19 infections are increasing. The use of antivirals against flu in primary care will help protect the most vulnerable over the winter. If you are eligible and have not managed to get vaccinated yet, now is the time. Health Minister Maria Caulfield said: Authorising the use of antivirals indicates that flu is reaching more serious levels so it is important that we take care. I’d encourage anyone eligible who is yet to come forward for the vaccine to book an appointment and get protected as soon as possible. These additional tools will help us relieve the pressure on our NHS as they cope with the busy Christmas and New Year periods and will provide extra protection not just for you but also for your loved ones. The alert concerning flu antiviral medicine has been issued to primary care settings including GPs and community pharmacies in England. The Department of Health and Social Care continues to work closely with the manufacturers of antiviral medicines, used in the treatment of flu, to monitor stocks and ensure that there are adequate supplies of these medicines available to meet UK demand.

Denise Fractious, 68, of Pasadena receives a COVID-19 vaccine during a clinic at Kaiser Permanente Pasadena on Oct. 12. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) By Rong-Gong Lin IIStaff Writer Dec. 16, 2023 3 AM PT Share Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URLCopied! Print COVID-19 and flu are rising across California, sparking new warnings from health officials to take precautions as the wider winter holiday season looms. The uptick is modest and not wholly unexpected — wintertime surges have been an annual occurrence since the coronavirus first emerged. But experts say lagging uptake of the latest reformulated vaccines has left some populations particularly vulnerable to severe health outcomes that are largely preventable at this point.Over the week that ended Dec. 9, 2,449 Californians were newly admitted to hospitals with a coronavirus infection, up 40% over the last month, according to federal data. Advertisement California was considered to have “high” viral illness activity level as of Dec. 9, among the worst designations in the country, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. As of Dec. 9, California was considered to have a “high” level of flu-like illness, which includes viral illnesses such as COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) Advertisement “Respiratory illness activity is rapidly increasing across the United States,” the CDC said in a bulletin Thursday afternoon. “Millions of people may get sick in the next month or two, and low vaccination rates mean more people will get more severe disease. Getting vaccinated now can help prevent hospitalizations and save lives.”A rise in viral illness is expected this time of year, but the prevalence of COVID-19 adds a considerable health burden that didn’t exist before the pandemic. COVID-19 remains the primary cause of new respiratory hospitalizations and deaths nationally, causing 1,000 fatalities a week. “COVID is still causing the most number of cases, the most number of hospitalizations and the most, unfortunately, number of deaths that we’re seeing week over week,” Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the CDC, said in an online discussion Tuesday. “So while we all wish we could leave COVID in the rearview mirror, it is still here with us, and so we need to make sure we are continuing to take it very seriously.” Advertisement Cohen last week urged people to take precautions such as getting vaccinated, avoiding people who are sick and staying home when ill, regular hand-washing, improving air ventilation and wearing a mask. California It’s time to get your COVID shot, CDC director says. Like, now The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says October is the right time to get vaccinated, before COVID circulation really ramps up.Oct. 11, 2023 “And get tested, so you know what you have and you can get treatment,” she said. “Getting tested and treated early can prevent you from getting severely ill, being hospitalized and can potentially save your life.”Relatively speaking, COVID-19, flu and another ailment — respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV — aren’t at the heights they were this time last year, when their simultaneous circulation spawned a “tripledemic” that stressed healthcare facilities across the state, especially children’s hospitals.Kaiser Permanente Southern California began noticing more COVID-19 illness starting in mid-November, with the rise accelerating after Thanksgiving, said Dr. Nancy Gin, regional medical director of quality and clinical analysis for the health system. California COVID, flu, RSV on the rise in California. Is another ‘tripledemic’ coming? California’s respiratory virus season is ramping up, prompting officials to renew their calls for residents to get vaccinated in hopes of reducing pressure on hospitals.Dec. 5, 2023 Coronavirus levels in Los Angeles County wastewater were at 38% of last winter’s peak for the week that ended Dec. 2, the most recent data available. That’s exactly the same as the height seen late this summer, when the region experienced a prolonged uptick in infections. The latest figure signals a “medium” level of concern, as defined by L.A. County health officials. Advertisement In the San Francisco Bay Area, coronavirus levels in the San Jose watershed’s sewage have been at a “high” level for weeks. Rising viral levels in wastewater is “like the canary in the coal mine,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert. Higher concentrations could be followed by more illness, potentially severe enough to require hospital care. “I’m just worried that it’s going to translate into hospitalizations around Christmastime,” he said. California Pregnant people can get a shot to protect babies from RSV, but some hit hurdles Some pregnant patients who were eager to get vaccinated to protect their babies against RSV instead met with obstacles.Dec. 13, 2023 Chin-Hong said he’s particularly concerned about seniors who haven’t received their updated vaccinations this autumn. Among Californians ages 65 and older, just 27% have received the latest COVID-19 vaccination that became available in September. Uptake is even lower in Los Angeles County — 21% — but higher in the Bay Area, where it’s around 40% in the most populous counties.Seniors who have not gotten the latest vaccine are “the population we’re seeing in the hospital,” Chin-Hong said, and, especially those who are older than 75, “the population that’s dying.” It’s also likely that many of those who are dying aren’t getting anti-COVID drugs in time. Advertisement Flu vaccination rates are slightly lower than they were at this time last year, according to data shared by the CDC. As of early November, 36% of U.S. adults had received their flu shot, compared with 38% at that time last year. And for RSV, just 16% of adults ages 60 and older had received the newly available vaccine as of Dec. 2.Alarmed by low vaccination rates, the CDC issued a health advisory on “the urgent need to increase immunization coverage for influenza, COVID-19 and RSV.” The agency asked healthcare providers to strongly urge immunizations, noting that “low vaccination rates, coupled with ongoing increases in national and international respiratory disease activity ... could lead to more severe disease and increased healthcare capacity strain in the coming weeks.” California Where Southern Californians can find the new COVID-19 vaccine The new COVID shot is available at CVS and Walgreens at no cost through most insurers. But Kaiser enrollees must wait until Sept. 28 to avoid paying out of pocket. Sept. 20, 2023 The CDC recommends virtually everyone ages 6 months and older get the latest flu and COVID-19 vaccinations. Adults ages 60 and older are also eligible to be vaccinated against RSV, which can be especially risky for older people with heart disease. There are two vaccines available for older adults: Abrysvo, made by Pfizer; and Arexvy, made by GSK. The CDC also recommends the Abrysvo vaccine for pregnant people and immunizing babies against RSV with an antibody known as nirsevimab, also known by the trademarked name Beyfortus.The agency is also urging doctors to recommend antiviral drugs for flu and COVID-19, such as Tamiflu and Paxlovid, for eligible patients. These “antiviral medications are currently underutilized, but are important to treat patients, especially persons at high-risk of progression to severe disease with influenza or COVID-19, including older adults and people with certain underlying medical conditions,” the CDC said. Such antiviral drugs “are most effective in reducing the risk of complications when treatment is started as early as possible after symptom onset,” the CDC said. Advertisement California For Subscribers California vs. Florida: The surprising answer to which state handled COVID better Amid controversies over stay-at-home and masking orders, a lasting difference between Govs. Gavin Newsom and Ron DeSantis’ approach may end up being rhetoric on vaccine safety.Nov. 27, 2023 So far, hospitals in Southern California and the Bay Area appear to be in fairly stable shape. More people are becoming ill, but so far, many aren’t needing to be hospitalized, Chin-Hong said.Kaiser Southern California has been noticing more people ill with COVID-19 in its clinics and urgent care centers, “but they’re not landing in the hospital nearly as much compared to last year, certainly compared to two years ago,” Gin said. “Time will tell if the numbers that we see continue to go up.” The health system, which serves 4.8 million members and operates 16 hospitals throughout the region, has observed a bit of a rise in the use of ventilators and intensive care units related to COVID-19, “but it’s certainly nothing dramatic,” Gin said. But cases of influenza type A virus nationally “are really shooting up quite a bit. We are seeing that as well,” Gin said. World & Nation The flu is soaring in seven states and rising in others, health officials say U.S. health officials say at least seven states are seeing high levels of the flu and that cases are rising in other parts of the country.Nov. 18, 2023 As for RSV, levels rose steadily from the end of September through mid-November. In the last few weeks, however, that virus seems to have flattened out at “less than half of what we saw last year at this time, at least by our testing numbers. So that’s a good sign,” Gin said. Increasing coronavirus transmission is probably being assisted by waning immunity from past infections and older booster shots. Advertisement Officials are also monitoring the rapid rise of the JN.1 subvariant. Because of its unusually high number of mutations, this subvariant — described as a closely related offshoot of the BA.2.86, or Pirola strain — might be able to more easily infect people who had previously caught an older version of the coronavirus or haven’t yet received an updated shot. Nationally, JN.1 is estimated to account for about 21% of coronavirus cases for the two-week period that ended Dec. 9, up from 8% in the prior two-week period. It’s the fastest-growing subvariant being tracked. Politics DeSantis bragged about a COVID study during Newsom debate. Not so fast, lead author says Ron DeSantis cited a scientific journal as evidence Florida had a lower COVID death rate than California. The study’s author says that’s not the whole story. Dec. 13, 2023 JN.1 is on the ascent while the current most dominant subvariant, HV.1, is declining. A descendant of the XBB subvariants that were dominant over the summer, HV.1 was estimated to account for 30% of coronavirus specimens for the most recent two-week period, down from 32% in the prior comparable period. The rise of the new subvariant should encourage people, especially those who are older, to get the new vaccine, as outdated booster shots or natural immunity from past infections may not be protective enough. The new vaccine will replenish antibodies, Chin-Hong said, which will be especially important for at-risk people. “Most people have gotten a previous infection, like during the summer, with one of the XBBs,” Chin-Hong said. The rise of JN.1 “just makes the clock tick faster before they’re more susceptible [to another coronavirus infection]. In other words, if the XBBs were the main game in town, you might have had a little bit more time before you would get infected again.” The CDC said available vaccines, tests and antiviral medication continue to work well against JN.1.

(KAIT) - Biologists report finding geese infected with avian flu in several Northeast Arkansas counties, including Craighead.The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said Wednesday that biologists conducting aerial surveys of waterfowl populations found small groups of dead snow geese and Ross’s geese in Arkansas, Craighead, and Lonoke counties.The geese were collected and tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, AGFC said.Additional suspected cases have been found in Clay, Poinsett, Faulkner, Prairie, and Pulaski counties.Biologists report finding geese infected with avian flu in several Northeast Arkansas counties, including Craighead.(Arkansas Game and Fish Commission)“While sightings are not as prevalent as last year’s outbreak, the continued presence of the disease on the landscape does create a need to update hunters and anyone who has domestic birds or poultry livestock,” AGFC stated.While the risk of infection is low among humans, hunters can help minimize the risk by following the following guidelines:Harvest only waterfowl that act and look healthy. Do not handle or eat sick animals.Wear disposable gloves when handling and cleaning game and field dress outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water afterward.Dispose of unwanted parts in a manner that prevents scavenging by domestic animals and wildlife.Thoroughly cook all game to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit before eating it.Do not feed pets or domestic animals uncooked portions of waterfowl.For more information, click here.Copyright 2023 KAIT.

Brown - December 12, 2023 6:50 am A nurse holds a vial of COVID-19 vaccine and syringe. Getty Images. Ahead of the winter holiday season, some Maryland doctors and state health officials are urging residents to get vaccinated for COVID and influenza ahead of celebrations and family visits, as new vaccines are available to help protect from COVID-19 and other respiratory ailments. “This is the first fall and winter virus season where vaccines are available for the three viruses responsible for most hospitalizations — COVID-19, RSV, and flu,” according to a September press release from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has urged people aged 6 months and older to receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine to better defend against modern variants of the virus. Updated Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been available as of September. According to Maryland Department of Health data on COVID-19, analyzed by Maryland Matters, there were an average of 303 people hospitalized with COVID each day in November. That’s up from an average of 244 people hospitalized each day in October. But Dr. James D. Campbell, an infectious disease pediatrician with the University of Maryland Children’s Hospital and professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, is also recommending that people also get their flu shot now, as the vaccine takes a few weeks to fully take effect. “We urge everyone to get their flu shots as soon as possible, especially if they plan to visit their relatives during the holidays,” he said. “The flu vaccine takes about two to three weeks to become fully effective, and it can prevent serious complications like pneumonia. Pneumonia can be very dangerous for young children, older adults and people with weak immune systems, but it can also affect healthy people,” Campbell said in a written statement. “In recent weeks we have seen a rise in hospitalization for respiratory illnesses at the University of Maryland Children’s Hospital and the broader University of Maryland Medical Center,” he added. According to data from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research and polling organization, 59.8% of Marylanders received a flu vaccine during the 2022-23 influenza season, higher than the national average of 49.3%. However, data shows that some adults are not interested in receiving vaccines such as the new COVID-19 booster ahead of the holidays. According to a November report from KFF, surveying adults from Oct. 31 through Nov. 7, only one in five adults said that they had received the new COVID vaccine at the time of the survey. The results also showed that 26% of adults said they would “definitely” or “probably” get the updated vaccine. KFF reported that people aged 65+ years or older were more likely to have already gotten the updated booster or were “definitely” intending to get one. “This is meaningful given that those ages 65 and older are more vulnerable to COVID-19, as they’re more likely to get seriously sick and experience complications that could result in hospitalization,” the KFF report says. But 34% of adults surveyed said that they would “definitely not” get the vaccine, and another 17% percent said that the would “probably not.” The survey results also found that 74% of adults were not too worried or not at all worried about catching COVID-19 over the holidays, and 68% were not worried or not at all worried about spreading COVID-19 to people close to them. The Maryland Department of Health has also urged Marylanders to take precaution this winter, and expanded an informational campaign urging residents to protect themselves against COVID-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. “We are also excited that this year, for the first time, there are RSV vaccines and antibody treatments available for older adults, pregnant women, and newborns to protect our most vulnerable Marylanders against severe RSV infections,” Maryland Department of Health Secretary Dr. Laura Herrera Scott said in a written statement. According to a November press release from the state health department, recent developments in vaccination and treatment efforts can help protect medically vulnerable populations from RSV, which can lead to serious respiratory health problems such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. “For Marylanders 60 and older, there is a new RSV vaccine that decreases the risk of severe illness from this respiratory virus,” the press release says. “There is also now protection for babies in the form of a new vaccine for pregnant women in their third trimester, as well as a monoclonal antibody treatment for newborns and at-risk infants.” XDoctors, health officials advise Marylanders to get vaccinated before holiday travel by Danielle J.

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved NEWS Coronavirus News You Can Now Get Free COVID-19 and Flu Tests and Treatments at Home By Claire Bugos Updated on December 11, 2023 Fact checked by Nick Blackmer Print Tang Ming Tung / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways U.S. adults can now access free tests to detect influenza and COVID-19 with one sample.If you test positive for either disease, regardless of where you took the test, you can get a free prescription for medications mailed to you or delivered to a nearby pharmacy.The program intends to make sure people with respiratory infections can take antiviral treatments at the right time to speed their recovery. You can now access free at-home testing and treatment for COVID-19 and flu through a government program that expanded nationwide this week. The National Institutes of Health teamed up with the digital health company eMed and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) to improve COVID-19 testing and treatment. The program launched as a pilot in select areas of the United States in January. It will now include testing and treatment for flu and will be available in all parts of the U.S., according to a statement from the National Institutes of Health on Wednesday. Anyone with a positive COVID-19 or flu test, regardless of whether they took the test through the program, can request a free telehealth consultation. A provider may then prescribe you an antiviral treatment. You can request to have it mailed to you overnight or delivered to a nearby pharmacy for pick up. “With the Home Test to Treat program, even patients in highly rural areas or with no access to a primary care physician can get enrolled in the program and, if medically indicated, have a prescription for an antiviral waiting for them at their nearest pharmacy within hours, or a prescription waiting for them on their front doorstep within a single day,” Michael Mina, MD, PhD, chief science officer at the digital health company eMed, said in an email. While any adult can request telehealth services, only people who are uninsured or are on a government healthcare plan, such as Medicare or Medicaid, can request a free test be mailed to their home. Those people don’t need to be experiencing symptoms to ask for a test. The program uses Pfizer’s Lucira at-home test, which can detect three viruses at the same time—COVID-19, Influenza A, and Influenza B. Lucira is a molecular test, which means it works like a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, rather than the antigen tests that are most common for at-home testing. “During this respiratory virus season, the symptoms of COVID, flu, and other viruses are very similar,” Mina said. “This is primarily because the symptoms are largely a reflection of our body attempting to fight off the virus. This means that symptoms alone are not enough to know what someone is infected with. Knowing which it is is essential for appropriate treatment decisions.” Antivirals for flu and COVID-19 must often be taken early in the course of the illness to be effective. The goal of the program, Mina said, is to help people get a diagnosis and treatment in a matter of hours, not days. Paxlovid, the most common antiviral treatment for COVID-19, must be taken within five days of developing symptoms. Flu antivirals, including Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) and Relenza (zanamivir), work when taken within two days of symptom onset. COVID-19 test results are less monitored now compared to earlier in the pandemic, leaving public health experts with less data to understand how the virus is spreading. However, CDC data show an increase of 17% in hospital admissions and 25% in deaths from COVID-19 in the most recent week. Fran Kritz contributed to the reporting of this story.

Cal-Maine Foods is working to secure production from other facilities to minimize disruption to its customers.This is the first case of HPAI to appear in a Cal-Maine Foods flock to date.“Cal-Maine Foods believes it has implemented and continues to maintain robust biosecurity programs across all its locations. Additional strict protocols are in place designed to prevent exposure from the Kansas facility to other locations, including the company’s nearby layer complex which houses approximately one million hens. The company continues to work closely with federal, state and local government officials and focused industry groups to mitigate the risk of future outbreaks and effectively manage the response,” the company said in a statement.The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has been reporting HPAI cases in commercial and backyard farms, and ordinarily updates its website around 11 a.m. daily. However, as of 11:30 a.m. on December 13, this case had not been reported.The last confirmed case in a commercial flock in Kansas listed on the APHIS website was a commercial upland gamebird operation in Mitchell County. That case was confirmed in February.Cal-Maine Foods operates an egg production facility near Chase, Kansas, which is in Rice County. The Chase operations have been the site of two recent fires, with one occurring in 2021 and another in 2019.Mississippi-based Cal-Maine Foods, according to the WATTPoultry.com Top Poultry Companies Database, is the world’s largest egg producer, with a flock of 44 million hens. Cal-Maine is the second publicly traded company to report the presence of HPAI in its hen supply during the past week. Post Holdings, parent company of Michael Foods, announced on December 7 that it lost 4.2 million hens to HPAI infections at two of its facilities.View our continuing coverage of the global avian influenza situation.

News Bird Flu Poultry Ban Exports Hong Kong Trade Chicken Turkey Agriculture Eggs US Poultry Exports Hit by Ban Amid Bird Flu Scare Published Dec 11, 2023 at 11:11 AM EST By Chloe Mayer FOLLOW Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Poultry and eggs from several parts of the U.S. have been slapped with a ban by worried officials in Asia who want to stop the food entering Hong Kong "to protect public health."The ban, which comes just two weeks before Christmas, will be a blow for some poultry farmers, who will no longer be able to export their products to the special administrative region of China. Western foods are often enjoyed over Christmas in Hong Kong, where Western and Chinese influences are uniquely fused, and roast turkey or goose is often served to mark the holidays.Authorities said the ban, which affects poultry from certain areas across five U.S. states, was instigated as the result of an outbreak of bird flu (the H5N1 virus) in parts of Europe. The U.S. avian influenza has been sweeping the globe. Besides the death and culling of infected birds, it is also responsible for the deaths of other animals that contracted the virus, such as cats, sea lions, and mink.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images The suspension of trade effected by Hong Kong comes despite experts insisting that humans can't contract avian influenza from properly cooked poultry or eggs. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said, "It is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry and poultry products in the United States. The proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165˚F kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses."Nevertheless, Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced on Monday "that in view of notifications from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) about outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in areas in Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the CFS has instructed the trade to suspend the import of poultry meat and products (including poultry eggs) from the relevant areas with immediate effect to protect public health in Hong Kong."

Appropriate action will be taken in response to the development of the situation."Newsweek has reached out to the U.S. Department of Agriculture seeking further information and comment.The CDC says that the transmission of bird flu to humans can occur, but "usually after close contact with infected birds," meaning people working on poultry farms hit by an outbreak or anyone interacting with wild birds are more likely to be affected than the general public.A human suffering from bird flu may suffer a fever, cough, sore throat, difficulty breathing, eye irritation, headaches, body aches, and diarrhea, and will need to be treated with anti-viral drugs, the CDC said.

What you can do to protect yourself and others from winter illnesses Avoiding others who are ill, sanitizing and/or washing hands often, covering coughs and sneezes when possible, and wearing a mask when in large groups all contribute to having a healthier winter. In addition, getting annual immunizations for flu and an updated COVID-19 vaccine will also decrease the severity of these illnesses. A vaccination or immunization is a preparation that is most often administered through needle injections to stimulate the body’s immune response against diseases. Generally, antibodies start to increase two weeks after a vaccine is given. There are many more viruses and the majority do not have a vaccine to boost the immune system. Influenza Expand Influenza is a serious viral respiratory infection that is caused by influenza viruses, types A and B, which infect the nose, throat, and lungs. People with SMA, young children and people 65 years and older are at risk for serious flu complications. Typically, influenza season begins in October and peaks between December and February. Common symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, headache, muscle and body aches, and fatigue. People with flu are most contagious in the first three to four days after illness begins. Influenza is spread by airborne droplets made by people with flu when sneezing, coughing, and talking that land in the nose or mouth or on the hands of others who touch their nose, mouth, or eyes. The usual time from exposure to symptoms is approximately two days. The influenza vaccine has been shown to reduce flu symptoms and decrease the risk for serious complications. The flu shot may not prevent infection, but it will take the infection from “WILD to mild” per the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The annual seasonal flu shot is recommended for everyone six months of age and older. Please note that the nasal spray Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) is not recommended for people with SMA. People with SMA and their caregivers and family should all receive the influenza vaccine. Common vaccine side effects include soreness, redness and/or swelling at the injection site, headache, fever, nausea, fatigue, and muscle aches that resolve in 1-2 days. If you have SMA and you become infected with influenza, please contact your healthcare provider to discuss possible antiviral medication for influenza. This is a medication that when started early in the course of infection can decrease the duration and severity of symptoms. COVID-19 Expand COVID-19 is a viral respiratory infection that is very contagious, spreads very quickly and is also spread by infected respiratory droplets. COVID-19 infection symptoms are similar to other viral illnesses with the exception that loss of taste and/or smell is more often associated with COVID infection, however, this is not a consistent symptom. To determine which infection someone may have, consider testing for the viruses. To protect against COVID-19 infection get the new COVID-19 vaccine (2023-2024 formula). Antibodies against COVID-19 wane over time. The COVID-19 vaccine has been shown to reduce symptoms and decrease the risk for serious complications. Although COVID-19 is rising across the U.S. now, the overall hospitalization rate is lower than last year thanks to immunity from vaccinations and prior infections. New COVID-19 vaccines 2023-2024 formula) were approved in September 2023 for people 12 years of age and older. For children 11 years of age and younger, the vaccines are available under an emergency use authorization similar to the initial launch of the COVID vaccine. If you have SMA and you become infected with COVID-19, please contact your healthcare provider to discuss an antiviral medication for COVID-19 to decrease the severity of symptoms. This is a medication that is most effective when started within a few days of developing symptoms. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Expand RSV is another common viral respiratory infection that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms during the fall and winter. However, infants, young children, older adults and people with SMA are at risk for serious complications including breathing difficulty and pneumonia that can result in hospitalization. Adults ages 60 years and over with or without SMA should consider receiving the RSV vaccine that was approved in July 2023. Antibodies persist for 2 seasons. Please discuss the benefits and risks of this new vaccine with your healthcare provider. To protect a young infant from severe RSV infection, people who are 32-36 weeks pregnant during September through January may receive the new RSV vaccine. This will result in maternal RSV antibodies that will transfer to the infant prior to birth and protect the infant from severe RSV illness during RSV season. Alternatively, after birth infants with SMA may receive RSV antibodies during their first RSV season either through one injection (Nirsevimab) or a series of five monthly injections during RSV season (Palivizumab). These antibodies wane over time. In summary, please obtain your flu shot and new COVID-19 shot to help you stay healthy through the winter. Take this time to also review your illness intervention plan with your healthcare team. Please consult with your healthcare provider about your care and the above information. If you are taking part in a clinical trial, please also contact your study team. If you qualify for RSV vaccine, are pregnant or have a young child with SMA please consider and discuss RSV vaccination with your healthcare provider.

File photo | Photo Credit: PTI A serious spike in respiratory infections for the past several weeks, mostly Influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19, has had the OP clinics and casualty wings of hospitals getting filled with people rushing in for consultations.(For top health news of the day, subscribe to our newsletter Health Matters)While there has been no spike in unusual or sudden pneumonia or hospitalisations, influenza can take a bad turn in the elderly and those with serious comorbidities, doctors warn.While this is the normal season of respiratory illnesses, the cooler weather with occasional rainy spells has seen the co-circulation of all viruses, especially Influenza A and RSV, which has been leaving people with persistent cough and fatigue lasting over weeks. The Sabarimala pilgrimage season and crowding are expected to make the situation worse. Since mid October-November, there is also a spike in COVID, probably because most cases of fever with cold/cough are getting tested now. There is also intense speculation that the new sub variant of Omicron virus variant — JN.1 — which is said to be highly immune evasive and which has been reported detected in Kerala a day ago, could be responsible for the spike in respiratory illnesses.However, clinicians point out that COVID endemicity is going into the fourth year and that the identification of new virus variants hardly throws up any surprises. The only red flag has to be a spike in hospital admissions or in the severity of cases.COVID variants“Hardly any COVID-related genomic sequencing is done now in the State. Even though JN.1 variant is said to have been detected in Kerala first, it might be recalled that this sub variant had been detected by Singapore in November from a traveller in India, during one of its airport screenings, indicating that JN.1 might have been in circulation much earlier and was undetected. COVID variants will keep emerging and co-circulate with influenza, RSV and adenoviruses, making it difficult to distinguish just on the basis of clinical symptoms. Which is why the State brought out the integrated guidelines for the management of all influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in June this year,” pointed out R. Aravind, Head of Infectious Diseases, Thiruvananthapuram Medical College.He pointed out that the State continues to follow the ABC guidelines for testing ILI/SARI. Testing patients with fever or flu symptoms of less than three days is not always necessary. But in the case of elderly, those with comorbidities and pregnant women, who are at risk of increased severity due to ILI, the general guidelines recommend early medical consultation and testing.Three deathsThe State reported three deaths due to COVID in the past few weeks and all three were persons with serious comorbidities, Health officials claimed. “We are testing everyone who reports with fever and flu symptoms of over three days and all vulnerable/high-risk persons are tested regardless of the duration of symptoms. Hospital admissions have not spiked but there have been quite a few cases wherein the patients required oxygen support. The public should resume masking in crowded places. We have made masking mandatory for all persons stepping into our casualty wing. It is also advisable that the elderly are given the flu vaccine,” said Rajalekshmi A., senior consultant, Infectious Diseases, KIMSHEALTH.

(KWCH) - The Kansas Department of Agriculture (KDA) said highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), also known as bird flu, has been identified in two Kansas egg layer facilities — one in McPherson County and one in Rice County.KDA animal health officials said both facilities increased their biosecurity with the initial HPAI outbreak in 2022 and have continued to monitor their flock. At a couple of points since early 2022, most recently last month, confirmed cases prompted temporary exhibit closures at the Sedgwick County Zoo. Once the facilities in Rice and McPherson counties noticed signs of HPAI in their birds, they immediately contacted KDA.“The affected premises were placed under quarantine and the birds will be humanely depopulated and disposed of in an approved manner to prevent the spread of the disease,” said the KDA.This marks five cases of HPAI in Kansas this fall, according to the KDA. Since the start of the outbreak in 2022, there have been 21 cases of HPAI in Kansas. The KDA, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA– APHIS), jointly responded to the incident impacting facilities in Rice and McPherson counties. KDA will be establishing a 12.5-mile surveillance zone around the infected premises. Other farms or properties with poultry that fall within that zone will not be allowed to move birds or poultry products on or off their property without permission from KDA.The animal health team is working to locate all poultry owners in the area to ensure they know the symptoms of HPAI and are taking critical steps to protect their birds.Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a contagious viral disease that can infect chickens, turkeys and other birds and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death in infected birds. Poultry owners should attentively monitor your birds for symptoms of HPAI which include: coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and other signs of respiratory distress; lack of energy and appetite; decreased water consumption; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; incoordination; and diarrhea. Avian influenza can also cause sudden death in birds even if they aren’t showing other symptoms.If these symptoms are observed in your birds, immediately contact your veterinarian. If you don’t have a regular veterinarian, contact KDA’s Division of Animal Health office toll-free at 833-765-2006.If you own poultry and live in McPherson or Rice counties, you’re asked to contact KDA at 833-765-2006 or KDA.HPAI@ks.gov. You can also self-report your birds at https://fs22.formsite.com/KansasDeptAg/zlb9fcr9oc/index.htmlAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern or a food safety concern.Copyright 2023 KWCH.

Novartis' flu vaccine plant OKed By Gareth Macdonald 17-Jun-2014 - Last updated on 12-Dec-2023 at 12:30 GMT Facebook Twitter Linkedin Email to a friend Cocker spaniel-derived MDCK cells key to winter influenza vaccine supplies A long dead cocker spaniel will play a key role in helping people avoid the flu this winter after a landmark approval from the US FDA for Novartis’ cell culture based vaccine plant. Which came first - the spaniel or the egg?If we are talking about influenza vaccine production then the answer is definitely egg. Hens’ eggs have been used for this purpose since shortly after Woodruff and Goodpasture discovered they could be used for viral culturing in 1931​.But, if the question is “which plays the most important role in flu vaccine production: the spaniel; or the egg?”, the answer could soon be ‘spaniel’ after Novartis was licensed to start making seasonal influenza vaccine at its cell culture plant in Holly Springs, North Carolina this week.The Swiss drugmaker manufacturers its vaccines using Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells derived from a female cocker spaniel in 1958​, which provide for a much simpler and more reliable production process according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Power.“Traditional influenza vaccine production depends on a large number of fertilized chicken eggs to grow virus strains and requires many months for organization of egg supplies, virus incubation and actual production before the vaccine is delivered to physicians or pharmacies.”​“Cell-culture manufacturing technology is an alternative production method to traditional egg-based production. Cell-culture technology utilizes a well-characterized mammalian cell line rather than chicken eggs to grow virus strains​” Power continued.She went on to tell BioPharma-Reporter.com that while the facility was already producing trial supplies of Novartis’ Flucelvax and adjuvants used in other products “the FDA licensure means that Holly Springs will produce seasonal flu vaccine for the 2014-2015 flu season​.” Novartis was contracted​ to develop the Holly Springs site​ for cell-culture vaccine production in 2007 by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as part of both the US’ seasonal vaccine production efforts and its pandemic preparedness programme. Power explained that: “As part of its contract with the US government, the site has also developed and tested vaccines and manufactured bulk stockpiles of antigens and adjuvants for pandemic threats, including H7N9 influenza, which emerged in 2013​.” Copyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are © 2024 - William Reed Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions Related topics Downstream Processing Cell lines Facilities Related news Show more When it comes to vaccine adjuvants, not all alum is equal Merck: Vaccine manufacturers must innovate or get left behind Single-use perfusion tech will cut cost of vaccine production, says Univercells Flu vaccine underwent 35 QA/QC tests in Italy death probe, says Novartis Show more Related suppliers WuXi AppTec Follow us Facebook Twitter Linkedin Webinars On-demand webinars Manufacturing Friendly Aggregate Clearance in Downstream Processing of Bispecific and Traditional Antibodies Using a Novel POROS Mixed-Mode Chromatography Media Thermo Fisher Scientific - Biosciences Headlines Aditum Bio and Leads Biolabs join forces in new company to fight autoimmune diseases Sarepta discontinues development of Duchenne ASO treatment vesleteplirsen Synaffix and BigHat Biosciences collaborate to develop AI-designed ADC EMA accepts Alvotech and Advanz Pharma’s Marketing Authorization Application for biosimilar of J&J’s Simponi AbbVie acquires Aliada Therapeutics in $1.4 billion deal Abzena announces major expansion of its biologics manufacturing facility Aldevron’s Anu Codaty on passion, leadership, and innovation AstraZeneca’s rare disease therapy Fasenra receives EU approval Promotional features Continuous bioprocessing set to revolutionize cGMP manufacturing of biologics By Just – Evotec Biologics Investing in high-purity guide RNA to unlock the power of CRISPR therapies By Sumitomo Chemical Europe Notes on compliance: Building the USP 71 sterility testing processes that support USP, EP and JP harmonized methods By Thermo Fisher Scientific More promotional features Follow us Facebook Twitter Linkedin BioPharma-Reporter Advertise with us Why Register?

The National Institute of Infectious Diseases estimated that the number of patients nationwide totaled around 1,118,000 during the same period. The rapid spread reflects lowered influenza immunity after cases had dropped in recent years amid anti-infection measures implemented against the coronavirus pandemic. Health experts say that fewer people have immunity against influenza since restrictions over the COVID-19 were lifted earlier this year, and that the influenza virus is spreading about a month earlier than normal. Coronavirus cases have also been increasing for the third consecutive week, authorities said. Experts have called for caution amid fears both viruses could spread further as year-end and New Year's social gatherings take place in Japan. School-wide and class-specific closures have taken place at 6,382 educational facilities nationwide in the week through Sunday, the ministry said. While influenza outbreaks typically occur in winter and the end of spring, this year saw an unusual increase in cases from August. The ministry cautioned against the flu in October when cases exceeded the advisory level for that month of 10 people per institution. "Individual measures for preventing infection are the same as those for COVID-19, including getting vaccinated, wearing masks, and avoiding crowded places," said Nobuhiko Okabe, head of the Kawasaki City Institute for Public Health.

Fewer than 2 in 5 adults have gotten their flu vaccine this season, and only about 1 in 6 have gotten the latest Covid-19 vaccine, according to CDC data. Francine Orr/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images CNN — The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is an “urgent need” to boost vaccination coverage amid increasing levels of respiratory disease. “Low vaccination rates, coupled with ongoing increases in national and international respiratory disease activity caused by multiple pathogens, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), and RSV, could lead to more severe disease and increased healthcare capacity strain in the coming weeks,” the agency wrote in a Health Alert Network advisory Thursday. “In addition, a recent increase in cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) following SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States has been reported.” Allissa Sanchez, LVN, gives her patient a vaccine during a flu and COVID-19 vaccination clinic at Kaiser Permanente Pasadena on Thursday, Oct. 12, 2023, in Pasadena, CA. Francine Orr/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images It’s not too late to get vaccinated, as the holidays – and respiratory virus season – ramp up About 7 million fewer adults have gotten their flu shot so far this season compared with the last virus season. Overall, uptake is about 36% for both adults and children, according to CDC data through November 18. Vaccination coverage for Covid-19 is also low, with just 17% of adults and about 8% of children getting the latest shot, according to CDC data through December 2. That includes about 36% of seniors, who are at higher risk for severe disease. Also, only about 16% of older adults ages 60 and up have gotten the new RSV vaccine. Key reasons for low vaccination rates include a lack of provider recommendation, concerns about side effects, and a lack of time or forgetting to get vaccinated, according to findings from a nationally representative survey of US adults that were shared in the CDC advisory. “We are seeing too few folks get vaccinated this season,” CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen said at a briefing with the American Medical Association on Tuesday. “The voice of the physician matters so much in whether or not folks decide to get vaccinated.” The CDC recommends the flu and Covid-19 vaccines for everyone ages 6 months and older, and the new RSV vaccine is available for adults 60 and up. A pharmacy in New York City offers vaccines for COVID-19, flu, shingles and pneumonia on December 6, 2021. Ted Shaffrey/AP You can get Covid-19 and flu vaccines at the same time, but should you? What the science says Immunization helps prevent hospitalization and death from respiratory disease, and it’s especially important for those at increased risk for severe disease, including infants, older adults, pregnant people and those with certain underlying medical conditions. “About 70 to 80% of American adults over the age of 18 have at least one condition that puts them at higher risk of a bad outcome,” Cohen said. “Getting vaccinated decreases your risk of hospitalization and death at every age, including 18 to 64, but it also decreases your risk of long Covid.” About 1 in 7 adults who have had Covid-19 report long Covid symptoms, including ongoing fatigue or cough, which can develop even after a mild illness, she said. Children are less likely to have severe outcomes, but emergency department visits and hospitalizations for respiratory disease are rising across age groups, CDC data shows.

In the past four weeks, hospitalizations increased 200% for flu, 51% for Covid-19 and 60% for RSV, according to the advisory. There have been 12 reported pediatric influenza deaths and 30 reports of MIS-C, a rare complication that typically happens a month after a Covid-19 infection. Respiratory disease activity in the US is highest in the South but quickly rising in Northern states. The CDC recommends that people talk with their health care providers about the vaccines that are recommended for them and their families. Locations offering the seasonal vaccines can be found on Vaccines.gov, and uninsured adults can receive Covid-19 vaccines at no cost through the CDC’s Bridge Access Program. Everyday prevention measures, such as covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands and staying home when sick, can also help reduce the spread of illness. “These tools that protect us – vaccines … testing and treatment and washing hands and ventilation and masks – all of these things are layers of protection that help make sure that we can weather this season,” Cohen said.

Oceanographer Silvina Botta, PhD, at the Rio Grande Federal University, told Reuters that the mammals' carcasses have to be buried or incinerated as soon as possible to reduce the risk of spreading the disease to birds, other animals, or people. Scientists have also found some sea mammals convulsing on local beaches as the H5N1 strain attacks their nervous system. Under government regulations, animals need to be euthanized to spare them "a very painful death," Botta said. She added that the virus first started killing sea mammals in Brazil in September, and three towns in the state still have active outbreaks. High-path H5N1 was first detected in Brazil in mid-May. H5N1 on farms, small flocks in 10 US states In the United States, the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has confirmed multiple H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in 10 states that affect chicken, turkey, and duck farms plus backyard flocks. The largest outbreak involved more than 2.6 million egg-laying chickens on a farm in Hardin County, Ohio. That state also reported H5N1 on a turkey farm in Darke County. Other states reporting turkey outbreaks are Arkansas (Carroll County), Minnesota (Becker and Todd counties), South Dakota (Bon Homme, Charles Mix, and Hamlin counties), and Wisconsin (Barron County). California confirmed an H5N1 outbreak at a farm housing 270,000 laying chickens in Sonoma County and a farm housing 258,600 broiler chickens in Stanislaus County, as well as an outbreak affecting 4,900 farm ducks in Sonoma County. Officials in Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, and Vermont confirmed the virus in small flocks. Study suggests race, ethnicity should be considerations in antibiotic stewardship News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship An outpatient antibiotic stewardship intervention implemented across a US urgent-care network was associated with reduced antibiotic prescription for respiratory encounters for all patients regardless of race, ethnicity, or preferred language, but disparities between groups remained, researchers reported today in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology. Michael Jung / iStock The stewardship intervention implemented at Intermountain Healthcare, which has urgent care facilities at hospitals in Utah and Colorado, included electronic health records tools, a transparent clinician benchmarking dashboard, and English- and Spanish-language education focused on urgent-care clinicians and patients. Although health equity was not explicitly considered when the intervention was designed, researchers at Intermountain Healthcare sought to determine if its effect differed by patient race, ethnicity, or preferred language. Comparing the 12-month baseline period (July 2018 to June 2019) with the intervention period (July 2019 to June 2020), the researchers found that all evaluated race, ethnicity, and preferred language categories saw reductions in respiratory antibiotic prescribing. An interrupted time series analysis found no difference in the impact of the intervention between studied groups: White people (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 0.96) versus non-White people (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.96); non-Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.96) versus Hispanic (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93 to 0.97); and those who preferred speaking English (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.96) versus those who preferred Spanish (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.99). Prescribing disparities persist The analysis, however, also found that differences in antibiotic prescribing between groups persisted over the course of the study, with higher proportions of White, non-Hispanic, and English-speaking patients receiving antibiotics. The study authors say that while they were not aware of these disparities when they designed the intervention, they have since integrated patient race, ethnicity, and preferred language into their antibiotic prescribing dashboard. "Our experience highlights the importance of not only examining interventions via factors related to health equity such as race, ethnicity, and language but also the need to design interventions that address the needs of all patient populations, especially those historically marginalized in healthcare delivery," they wrote. Obesity tied to COVID-related inflammatory syndrome, poor outcomes in kids News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 Iuliia Burmistrova / iStock Obesity is more common in patients diagnosed as having COVID-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) than those with Kawasaki disease (KD) and is tied to worse outcomes, suggests a study published late last week in JAMA Network Open. A University of Alberta researcher led the study of 1,767 KD and MIS-C patients at 42 sites in eight countries from January 2020 to July 2022. Of 1,767 children, 338 had KD (median age, 2.5 years; 60.4% boys), and 1,429 had MIS-C (median age, 8.7 years; 61.4% boys). KD inflames blood vessels and can lead to long-term complications and death. MIS-C is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by heart abnormalities that usually resolve within weeks, the authors noted. Obesity not associated with KD outcomes The prevalence of overweight and obesity was significantly higher in MIS-C than KD (41% vs 23%). Rates of overweight (17.1% vs 11.5%) and obesity (23.7% vs 11.5%) were significantly higher in MIS-C than KD, even after adjustment for age, sex, and race. For KD, higher adiposity (overweight) categories weren't tied to lab results or disease outcomes, except for intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. The findings of this study suggest that obesity is a comorbid factor that should be considered at the clinical presentation in children with MIS-C. For MIS-C, higher adiposity was associated with worse lab test results and outcomes, including a greater likelihood of shock, ICU admissions, and need for inotropic drugs to strengthen heart contractions, as well as higher concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers and levels of creatinine (measure of kidney health) and alanine aminotransferase (measure of liver health). "The findings of this study suggest that obesity is a comorbid factor that should be considered at the clinical presentation in children with MIS-C," the researchers wrote. In a related commentary, Kirsten Dummer, MD, and Jane Burns, MD, both of the University of California San Diego, said obesity is difficult to disentangle from social determinants of health and variant exposure. "Given the global decrease in MIS-C case numbers, the data presented by Khoury and colleaguesmay be the final word on the possible role of obesity in influencing clinical disease severity in MIS-C." Small, deadly outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever tied to city in Mexico, CDC says News brief Jim Wappes Topics Tick-borne Disease The brown dog tick, which transmits the disease. Ingeborg van Leeuwen / Flickr cc At least five people have contracted the tick-borne disease called Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) after travel to Mexico, and three died, the US Centers for Disease control and Prevention (CDC) said in a Health Alert Network advisory late last week. All the patients—four of whom are children—were treated at hospitals in Southern California after travel to Tecate, a city in Baja California, which is a Mexican state south of California. The CDC noted that RMSF is a rapidly progressive disease and can be fatal within days without early administration of the antibiotic doxycycline. Early treatment essential The CDC said, "Consider initiating doxycycline based on presumptive clinical and epidemiologic findings, and do not delay treatment pending the result of a confirmatory laboratory test. Early treatment with doxycycline saves lives." The patients were diagnosed as having lab-confirmed RMSF since late July. All had traveled to or had lived in Tecate within 2 weeks of illness onset. The disease is endemic in multiple border states in northern Mexico. Three patients were US residents, and two were Mexicans. All five were hospitalized, and three died. Early treatment with doxycycline saves lives. The bacterium that causes RMSF, Rickettsia rickettsii, can be transmitted by brown dog ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus), which feed on dogs in and around cities in some regions. The CDC said many people who have the disease don't recall a tick bite. RMSF signs and symptoms can be relatively mild and not very specific during the first 1 to 4 days of illness and include a low to moderate fever, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal pain, muscle aches, rash, and swelling around the eyes and on the back of hands. Patients with more advanced disease may experience altered mental state, coma, brain swelling, difficulty breathing, and multiorgan system damage. The case-fatality rate of RMSF in Mexico can exceed 40%, the CDC said. Chronic wasting disease detected in another Texas county News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Chronic Wasting Disease Larry Smith / Flickr cc Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been detected for the first time in Coleman County, Texas. In a news release, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) late last week confirmed a CWD case in a 2-year-old whitetail buck harvested by a hunter on a low-fenced property and tested through surveillance sampling. The TPWD said it will establish CWD containment and surveillance zones in the area this year or next. In Texas, the disease was first discovered in 2012 in free-ranging mule deer along a remote area of the Hueco Mountains near the border with New Mexico, the release said. Since then, it has been detected in state captive and free-ranging cervids, including white-tailed deer, mule deer, red deer, and elk. CWD is a fatal neurologic disease caused by infectious misfolded proteins called prions. While the disease is not known to infect humans or other non-cervid animals, experts fear it could jump species. Zambia reports 684 suspected anthrax cases, 4 deaths News brief Jim Wappes Topics Anthrax Mike W. / Flickr cc Zambia is reporting by far its most widespread anthrax outbreak ever, with 684 suspected cases and 4 deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported late last week. Cases have been reported in 9 of Zambia's 10 provinces. Previous outbreaks were confined to Northwest and Western provinces, with sporadic cases over the years. "Of note," the WHO said, "Zambia reported anthrax outbreaks in both human and animals in Western Province in 2017 and in Eastern Province in 2016 and 2011." The 2011 outbreak involved 511 suspected cases. First patients ate meat from dead hippos The outbreak began in June in Sinazongwe district in Southern province. Twenty-six people developed sores on their face, arms, and fingers after eating meat from three wild hippopotamus carcasses. Around the same time, cattle, goats, and hippos were reportedly dying from an unknown cause in surrounding areas. Sinazongwe district remains the outbreak epicenter, accounting for 287 cases (42% of the total) and 2 deaths. The risk of anthrax transmission to neighbouring countries is increased. Anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis that typically affects ruminants like cows, sheep, and goats. The bacteria produce extremely potent toxins, and people can develop the disease by contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. The WHO said, "The epidemic is spreading along the provinces located along the basin of the Zambezi, Kafue, and Luangwa rivers, which is an additional problem because these rivers also flow into Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, Kahora Bassa in Mozambique and Lake Malawi, and the risk of anthrax transmission to neighbouring countries is increased." Sexually transmitted infections climbing in Europe News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Sexually Transmitted Infections New data from Europe show a sharp increase in sexually transmitted infections, according to surveillance reports published late last week by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The surveillance reports on gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, congenital syphilis, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) "collectively reveal a dynamic and challenging landscape," the ECDC said in a press release. Following a drop in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were 46,728 confirmed cases of gonorrhea across 27 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries in 2021, with an overall crude notification rate of 13.7 cases per 100,000 population—higher than observed in 2019. In addition, the proportion of gonococcal isolates with resistance to azithromycin—one of the last remaining recommended antibiotics for gonorrhea—rose from 3.7% in 2017 to 14.1% in 2021. The reports on chlamydia and syphilis showed similar trends, with dips in 2020 followed by increases in 2021. There were 184,542 and 25,270 confirmed cases of chlamydia and syphilis in 2021, respectively. Congenital syphilis cases fell in 2020 and 2021 following a peak in notifications in 2019. Altogether, these reports signal a critical juncture in the battle against STIs in Europe. While men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for more than half of reported gonorrhea cases and 77% of syphilis cases, rates of chlamydia were highest among young adult heterosexual women. The ECDC also reported a sharp rise in the incidence of LGV, an infection that's caused by the same bacterium that causes chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis) but has potentially long-lasting consequences. The ECDC notes the number of cases reported is likely an underestimation since many EU/EEA countries don't have surveillance systems for LGV. 'Collaborative efforts' needed The ECDC said enhanced prevention activities that focus on increased testing, targeted messaging, and tailored interventions are crucial, and that ongoing monitoring of antimicrobial resistance is "imperative" for informing treatment strategies and addressing emerging challenges. "Altogether, these reports signal a critical juncture in the battle against STIs in Europe," the agency said. "Collaborative efforts among public health authorities, healthcare providers, and communities are essential to curb the spread of these infections."

Cold & FluNews‘Long Flu’ Is a Thing — and Can Cause Long-Lasting Health IssuesA recent study also confirms that risks of long COVID are much more debilitating than the long-term effects of influenza.ByBecky UphamFact CheckedPublished on December 15, 2023For some people, symptoms of COVID-19 and the flu can linger for long after their initial infection.iStockCOVID-19 isn’t the only viral infection that causes lingering health problems — the seasonal flu is also linked to an increased risk of certain conditions well after the acute phase, according to a new study of veterans who were hospitalized with either COVID-19 or the flu.The research, published on December 14 in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, found that in the 18 months after infection, people hospitalized for either COVID-19 or seasonal flu had an increased risk of death, hospital readmission, and health problems in the heart, lungs, brain, kidneys, and other organs.“The study illustrates the high toll of death and loss of health following hospitalization with either COVID-19 or seasonal influenza,” said coauthor Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis and the chief of research and development at VA St. Louis Health Care System in a press release.“Many people think they’re over COVID-19 or the flu after being discharged from the hospital. That may be true for some people. But our research shows that both viruses can cause long-haul illness,” said Dr. Al-Aly.The Presence of Long COVID Prompted Investigators to Examine Long FluSince the COVID-19 pandemic began, extensive research has emerged detailing the virus’s ability to attack multiple organ systems and potentially resulting in long COVID.“A major lesson we learned from SARS-CoV-2 is that an infection that initially was thought to only cause brief illness also can lead to chronic disease,” said Al-Aly, noting that before the pandemic, it wouldn’t have even occurred to him to examine the possibility of a “long flu.”“We wanted to know whether and to what degree people with flu also experience long-term health effects,” Al-Aly said.Long-Term Health Risks Are Higher for COVID-19 in Nearly Every System in the BodyUsing records from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, researchers compared the long-term health outcomes of about 11,000 people hospitalized with influenza from 2015 to 2019 with those of about 81,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19 from 2020 to 2022.This included how many people went on to develop any of 94 different health risks, risk of death, and risk of hospital readmission 18 months post-infection.“The risks were higher in COVID for all organ systems except the pulmonary system [lungs], which was higher in flu. This tells us the flu is truly more of a respiratory virus, like we’ve all thought for the past 100 years,” said Al-Aly.By comparison, COVID-19 is more aggressive and indiscriminate in that it can attack the lungs, but it can also strike any organ system and is more likely to cause fatal or severe conditions involving the heart, brain, kidneys, and other organs, he said.Relative to people who’d had the flu, people with COVID-19 were at increased risk of 64 of the identified complications, including fatigue, mental-health problems, and lung, gut, and heart issues.The flu was associated with a 6 percent elevated risk of health conditions in 6 of the 94 conditions, mostly in the respiratory system.People With COVID Had a Greater Risk of Death and Hospital Readmission in the 18 Months After Infection Compared With People Who Had the FluPeople who had COVID-19 had a 50 percent higher risk of death than those with the flu, which translated to about 8 more deaths per 100 people in the COVID-19 group compared with the flu group, confirming findings shown in previous research.The COVID-19 group also experienced an increased risk of hospital readmission as well as admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). For every 100 people in each group, there were 20 more hospital admissions and nine more ICU admissions in COVID-19 than flu.The findings were consistent as dominant variants shifted from pre-delta to delta and later omicron, and found in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, according to the authors.The authors did acknowledge limitations of the study — a major one being that it focused only on people hospitalized for COVID and flu and didn’t include a control group of people without either infection. In addition, the VA data was heavily skewed toward older male patients, so there are remaining questions as to how these health burdens affect people of other ages and sexes.COVID-19 Remains A Much More Serious Threat to Human Health Compared With the Flu“The findings show that COVID-19 remains a much more serious threat to human health than the flu,” said Al-Aly“One thing that really stuck out is that in almost every area that was measured, it was worse almost always with the people who had COVID-19 than it was with people who had the flu,” says David Wohl, MD, a professor of medicine in infectious diseases at the UNC School of Medicine in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.“These findings really push back firmly and conclusively against statements like ‘COVID is just like the flu.’ It is not like the flu,” says Dr. Wohl, who was not involved in the study.“The idea that COVID-19 or flu are just acute illnesses overlooks their larger long-term effects on human health,” Al-Aly said. A big “aha” moment was the realization that long-term health losses were more serious than the initial symptoms patients experienced in the first 30 days after infection, he noted.“Long COVID is much more of a health problem than COVID, and long flu is much more of a health problem than the flu,” said Al-Aly.‘We Need to Wake Up’ to the Seriousness of Viral InfectionsPre-pandemic, the medical community tended to dismiss most viral infections as somewhat inconsequential, and people would typically recover after being sick for a few days, said Al-Aly.“But we’re discovering that is not everyone’s experience. Some people are ending up with serious long-term health issues. We need to wake up to this reality and stop trivializing viral infections and understand that they are major drivers of chronic diseases,” he said.Other recent studies support Al-Aly’s comments that even routine viral infections can cause symptoms and health issues that linger. In a study published in December 2022 in JAMA Network Open, for instance, a study of 1,000 adults, most of whom weren’t hospitalized, about half of people sick with something other than COVID-19 reported ongoing issues three months later.A study published in September 2021 in PLoS Medicine that included both hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients also found that about 40 percent of people with the flu experienced at least one symptom commonly associated with long COVID in the six months after their illnesses.Trying to Untangle Long Effects of Infections“I do think that we're learning that some viruses do cause reactions, like long COVID, and maybe there is a post-viral syndrome with influenza that's also being picked up here. However, it’s very difficult to tease out what could be due to having COVID or the flu specifically versus being sick enough to be in the hospital,” says Wohl.For example, if you were following people who had a heart attack and were hospitalized, some things may happen to them over the next 18 months that may not be related to their heart attack, but just being debilitated, he says.“So, I think here it's hard to tease out what’s long COVID versus COVID knocked you down, and you just never really got back up, and you had a cascade of other things happen to you. That can happen, especially to older people, especially if they were in the hospital,” he says.Findings Highlight the Importance of Prevention and TreatmentThese findings really emphasize why prevention is so important and necessary, says Wohl. “Only around 60 percent of folks in these two groups were vaccinated. This is a high-risk group — why isn’t that number 99 percent? A lot of these illnesses could have been prevented by getting a COVID vaccine and a flu vaccine,” he says.People should also be aware that there’s treatment for people who do get sick, says Wohl. “Taking treatment once you do get diagnosed is really important. Paxlovid is used to treat COVID-19 and reduce the risk of these kinds of outcomes,” he says.In November 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a real-world study showing that adults who took Paxlovid within five days of a COVID-19 diagnosis had a 51 percent lower hospitalization rate within 30 days compared with those who didn’t take the drug.Editorial Sources and Fact-CheckingEveryday Health follows strict sourcing guidelines to ensure the accuracy of its content, outlined in our editorial policy.

Activate your Online Access NowArticle contentThe silver lining, if it can be called that, is that H1N1 (also known as a “pandemic strain” from the pandemic scare of 2009) is addressed by the current flu vaccine in the Northern Hemisphere, Saxinger said, so people who have their flu vaccination up to date are expected to have a reduced risk of the flu or its severity.A surprising number of hospitalizations in the 18-65 age group suggests more people should get vaccinated for the flu, she said.While the public dashboard says vaccination rates aren’t available, it is tracked by the province elsewhere, Saxinger said, noting that provincial data tracking vaccination suggests that early vaccinations were strong but fewer people are getting immunization later in the campaign.“The perception is that there’s not as visible messaging around influenza vaccine importance,” she said. Not underscoring vaccination importance would be a mistake — even at this stage of the game, she said.“Even if flu season is hitting its peak soon, it’s not too late to get a shot. There’s going to be as many cases on the way down (from the peak) as on the way up.

The death rate among hospitalizations for flu overall is 0.6 per cent. While the numbers suggest kids are getting the flu and getting hospitalized, there were no juvenile flu deaths reported as of the Dec. 2 numbers.Alberta Medical Association president Dr. Paul Parks confirmed the flu has yet to hit its seasonal peak — but hospital and emergency room capacity have surged past their limits.“This is very early for us to peak with these kind of volumes, that’s why we’re very concerned,” he said.“It’s as bad as we’ve seen it in 25 years, that’s how bad it is right now,” Parks said.Based on an August-to-August respiratory season, the dashboard includes RSV cases and positivity rates, but severe outcomes data on RSV is still to come.jcarmichael@postmedia.comFor more health news and content around diseases, conditions, wellness, healthy living, drugs, treatments and more, head to Healthing.ca – a member of the Postmedia Network.Article contentShare this article in your social network Share this Story : Flu bug gets ugly in Alberta: H1N1 rates soar across province Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr CommentsYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.Create an AccountSign in Join the Conversation Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

File | Photo Credit: Reuters Doctors in Singapore are calling on people to vaccinate and to put on a face mask to reduce the usual year-end increase in acute respiratory infections, including COVID-19, influenza and the common cold.(For top health news of the day, subscribe to our newsletter Health Matters)Both Healthway Medical, the largest general practice chain with more than 120 clinics, and Parkway Shenton with 55 GP clinics, say they have seen a 30% increase in respiratory infections, according to a report by The Straits Times on December 12.“Raffles Medical with 43 GP clinics has also noticed an increase in such ailments,” the report added. COVID-infected Indian-origin Singaporean jailed for coughing at colleagues The latest Ministry of Health (MOH) data for the week ending December 2 showed an average of 2,970 cases a day at Singapore’s 25 polyclinics against a five-year median of 2,009 daily cases for 2018 to 2022 for this time of the year.While this is lower than the 3,000 to 3,500 a day in the pre-pandemic years, it comes on the back of almost three years of low infection rates due to precautions taken against COVID-19. In 2020 and 2021, polyclinics were seeing fewer than 1,000 cases a day in early December.Polyclinics treat about 20% of acute cases in the primary care setting, with the 1,800 GP clinics handling the rest.For the same week, more than 32,000 people were diagnosed with COVID-19 — about 460 were hospitalised and nine needed intensive care, adding significantly to the bed crunch at public hospitals. Respiratory infections, influenza cases on the rise in Kerala Professor Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases expert at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: “During this holiday season, as upper respiratory tract infections including COVID-19 cases rise, it is important to be mindful of others. Wear a mask in crowded places, stay home if unwell, and get the latest flu jab as well as a COVID-19 booster to avoid disrupting your travel plans.” Doctor Jonathan Tan, a family physician at Healthway, added: “We usually see more respiratory infections during the year-end. However, this year we are seeing an even larger increase in the number of upper respiratory tract infections.“Fortunately, the majority of cases are mild and can be treated in an outpatient setting,” he said. He too advised staying updated with Influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations and to mask up, especially in crowded places, as this can reduce the chances of catching air-borne bugs.COVID-19 vaccines are free in Singapore, as is the Influenza vaccine for those who have signed up for Healthier SG, the national scheme introduced in 2023 to encourage people to stick to one family doctor who can provide preventive care to keep them healthy.The actual number of people with Influenza is relatively low, with the majority suffering from the common cold.The MOH, which tracks Influenza infections to spot possible pandemics, said: “The proportion of patients with Influenza-like illness among the polyclinic attendances for acute respiratory infection is 0.5%.” Out of this small number with Influenza-like illness, only 11.5% tested positive for the flu virus over the past four weeks.Dr. Tan said people who feel sick should promptly test for COVID-19 at home. If they test positive, there is the option of taking antiviral medications such as Tamiflu. This will reduce the severity of symptoms.Doctor Edwin Chng, Parkway Shenton’s medical director, said: “Those with risk factors, including the elderly and immunocompromised people, should see a doctor for proper assessment.” He said people should practise good hygiene — which most people were doing during the pandemic years — such as hand washing and not touching their face with their hands, as this could spread diseases like the common cold, COVID-19 and the flu.Doctor Chng Shih Kiat, medical director at Raffles Medical, said some patients seen at its clinics needed to be prescribed antivirals, though the majority of patients had relatively mild symptoms.To avoid getting sick, he advised people to stay healthy and eat a balanced diet with an adequate intake of fruits and vegetables.“It is also important to get ample rest and stay hydrated. Exercise regularly, but do not over-exert with overzealous exercise routines. When travelling, wear a mask, especially in crowded places,” the broadsheet had Dr. Chng as saying.

This year the exhibit will be offered virtually due to avian influenza. File photo by Dan Gleiter | dgleiter@pennlive.comBy Sue Gleiter | sgleiter@pennlive.comA popular attraction will be absent at the 2024 Pennsylvania Farm Show.For the second year in a row, poultry competitions, including chickens and ducks, are banned due to a risk of avian influenza. The ban includes the popular in-person baby chick-hatching exhibit, which will be offered virtually.The Farm Show runs Jan. 6-13 at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex & Expo Center in Harrisburg under the theme “Connecting Our Communities.” Much like a state fair, the show celebrates the state’s agricultural industry with a butter sculpture, tractor square dancing, animal competitions, food and much more.The avian flu is a highly contagious fatal disease to poultry and poses a huge threat to the poultry industry. In Pennsylvania, it has already killed over 4.5 million birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Pa. Department of Agriculture Spokeswoman Shannon Powers emphasized the ban is designed to protect the state’s $7.1 billion poultry industry.As far back as April 2022, the state ordered a ban on poultry and egg exhibits at county fairs to protect poultry in the state.In the past, the show featured a baby duck slide but it hasn’t returned since 2019.Domestic poultry such as chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants, emus and ostriches are most susceptible to avian influenza, according to the state Department of Agriculture. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza is highly contagious and often fatal to birds.Right now, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reporting no cases of avian influenza in commercial or backyard poultry flocks in the state.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

(Mike McArthur/CBC)Social Sharing"They should not be let in."This is the advice given by a B.C. infectious disease expert for this holiday season if a dinner guest shows up coughing on the doorstep.Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre, reminded people on CBC's The Early Edition Monday that while we may be coming out of the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic, the same precautions must be taken this winter when someone presents with cold or flu symptoms.A range of viral and bacterial infections are all back in circulation, including COVID-19."In Canada, there are 4,000 people in hospital, two or three deaths per hour," Conway said about the current COVID situation.The Early Edition6:15Respiratory illness season meets the holidays: what are the risks?We hear from an infectious diseases specialist about what exactly is circulating right now, and how best to protect ourselves.Conway is not the only medical expert in the province sounding the alarm this respiratory season.Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix also held a joint press event Monday reminding people to get vaccinated against COVID and influenza, especially before indoor holiday gatherings are in full-swing.According to Henry and Dix, while COVID-19 numbers have dropped in B.C., the virus is still circulating and other respiratory illnesses are seeing a rise in cases."The good news is that COVID-19 activity continues to decrease and stay relatively low since the peak that we had in early October this year, while influenza A, on the other hand, and it's mostly the H1N1 strain, and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) activity, are starting to increase," said Henry.Respiratory illness on the riseHenry said adult visits to emergency rooms and primary care providers for respiratory illnesses have increased recently, as have pediatric emergency department visits. She said H1N1 appears to be the dominating strain of influenza circulating and that it can cause severe illness in younger people.Anyone over six months can get an influenza vaccine, she said."It's not too late to get that extra protection," she said. WATCH | Canadian medical professionals bracing for busy cold and flu season:Brace for another big cold and flu season, experts say12 months agoDuration 0:01Canadian doctors are bracing for what could be another busy cold and flu season as cases of RSV and influenza are on the rise while COVID-19 continues to circulate.Dix said there is an increasing demand for hospital services a month before the anticipated peak of flu season in the first week of January, and the province has increased its base bed capacity from 9,200 to 9,929, all of which are now being used.Ask CBC NewsHow to access the new RSV vaccine, and how much will it cost? Your questions answeredThe health minister said more acute and surge beds have also been allocated to address the "significant" numbers of people currently seeking hospital care. He said there are 170 more patients in hospital now than there were at this time last year."Throughout the system, we are better prepared than we had been at any time to deal with these large numbers of patients," said Dix.Stay homeConway said he is worried about virus fatigue — meaning people getting tired of following medical advice when they have symptoms. He said only 15 per cent of Canadians have received the latest vaccine for the coronavirus that causes COVID."Stay home if you're sick," said Conway. "They're all back. The 'tridemic' — influenza, RSV, COVID — they're back."Conway also said Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a bacterium that causes lung infections including pneumonia, has been showing up more than past years.Parts of the U.S. and China, along with several European countries, are reporting higher levels of pneumonia infections, while South Korean health officials announced hospitalizations for the illness have doubled in the last month, mostly among children. Henry says the best way to protect yourself and others this holiday season is to get vaccinated for influenza and COVID-19. (Mike McArthur/CBC)While there is no formal laboratory-based monitoring happening here in Canada, public health laboratories will be on the lookout for any unusual mycoplasma pneumonia activity, the Public Health Agency of Canada told CBC News. Henry said the situation is being monitored in B.C. "We have seen some sporadic cases," said Henry. "But not an increase in adults or children above what we would normally see in a pre-pandemic year."Health Canada approves updated Novavax vaccine to protect against COVID-19RSV infections surge as hospitals brace for return of 'normal' respiratory virus seasonIn addition to staying home, Conway wants people to seek medical advice if they feel sick because if they have a bacterial infection, a prescribed antibiotic could be necessary.

"We need to keep our guard up"Provincial health officials say there are currently 182 people in hospital with COVID-19 in British Columbia and, of those, 17 are in critical care.Approximately 1.4 million doses of the influenza vaccine and 1.2 million COVID-19 vaccinations have been administered provincewide this respiratory season, according to the B.C. government.With files from Lauren Pelley and The Early EditionCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Top stories from British Columbia Victims' families, women's advocates demand RCMP halt plan to dispose of Robert Pickton evidence Public warned about 4 women suspected of practising unlawful midwifery in B.C.

Enter the term “long flu.” A team from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System found that people who were hospitalized with seasonal flu can suffer long-term, negative health effects (especially in the lungs and airways). The findings were published Thursday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Researchers compared the flu virus and SARS-CoV-2. Upon analysis, they found that people hospitalized for either virus had a higher risk of being readmitted, dying or having multiple health problems in organ systems. The time of the highest risk was within 30 days of the initial infection. The team followed up on people up to 18 months after the initial infection. In addition to investigating readmissions and death risks, researchers evaluated 94 adverse health outcomes that can affect a person’s organs. Data came from the US Department of Veterans Affairs, and it included details on 81,280 people hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022. The data also included 10,985 people who were hospitalized for seasonal flu from Oct. 1, 2015, through Feb. 28, 2019. Over the course of the 18-month study period, people with COVID-19 had a 50% higher risk of death than the flu, the team noted. Notably, the overall risk and occurrence of death, hospital admissions and impacts to organ systems were substantially higher among COVID-19 patients than among those who had seasonal influenza, the team found. The flu has higher risks on the pulmonary system than COVID-19, though, they added. Vaccination didn’t play a protective role, the authors noted. “Five years ago, it wouldn’t have occurred to me to examine the possibility of a ‘long flu,’” Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University, said in a statement. “A major lesson we learned from SARS-CoV-2 is that an infection that initially was thought to only cause brief illness also can lead to chronic disease. This revelation motivated us to look at long-term outcomes of COVID-19 versus flu.” Both COVID-19 and the flu led to long-term health problems, and the long-term health loss was worse than the problems that these patients endured in the early phase of the infection, he added. “Long COVID is much more of a health problem than COVID, and long flu is much more of a health problem than the flu,” Al-Aly added. This corresponded to about eight more deaths per 100 persons in the COVID-19 group than among those with the flu. People with COVID-19 had a higher risk of readmission and admission to the intensive care unit. For every 100 people in each group, there were 20 more hospital admissions and nine more ICU admissions in those with COVID-19 compared to those with the flu. Although people who had COVID-19 displayed a greater risk of health loss compared to those with the flu, infection with either virus had significant risk of disability and disease. The researchers found those with COVID-19 showed an increased risk of 68% of health conditions examined across all organ systems (64 of the 94 adverse health outcomes studied). In terms of the flu, it was linked to having an elevated risk of 6% of health conditions (six of the 94), mostly in the respiratory system. covid-19 vaccine Flu Flu Shot long COVID Top Stories View All News CMS gives nursing homes months more to complete onerous revalidation process News Advocate, collaborate for successful SNF discharges: expert News Gen Z influence on LTC workplace requires careful leadership dance Editors' Picks View All Don’t let this happen to you By John O'Connor Trust but verify, on election day … and every day By Kimberly Marselas Controlling your destiny By John O'Connor Featured Content View All Partner content The ultimate guide to increasing capital for long-term care facilities Market Leaders Podcasts Leveraging ACOs to deliver high quality primary care in senior living News Subscribe About Us Contact Us Advertise Copyright © 2024 Haymarket Media, Inc.

The record was set during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009.For the week ending Dec. 9, there were 1,800 lab-confirmed influenza cases in the province, surpassing the previous record of 1,778 set in the week of Oct. 25, 2009.Representing nearly nine in 10 of the cases, influenza A (H1N1) is driving this epidemic as we approach the end of the calendar year.With Christmas get-togethers just days away, there are some tried and true ways to prevent giving or receiving influenza as a gift. 2:06 Lethbridge pharmacy faces challenge in initial vaccine rollouts At the top of Dr. Daniel Gregson’s list is getting vaccinated. Story continues below advertisement “That’s the most important thing,” the University of Calgary infectious diseases assistant professor said. “That’s going to really reduce your risk of getting infections by about half, your risk of getting in the hospital by about half.”Gregson also recommended using the days ahead of a dinner or other get-together to prevent bringing an unwanted guest.“You might think about other things we used, non-pharmaceutical things to prevent infection during that week before your Christmas function,” he said. “Avoiding large crowds, going out in large crowds with masks on. Those are all things you can do to reduce your risk over the holiday seasons.”The Public Health Agency of Canada says the use of respirators, like NIOSH-certified N95 or certified KN95, can help prevent the spread of COVID-19, guidance that matches with what aerosol scientists say about preventing airborne diseases.“The other thing really is that if you’re sick, don’t go,” Gregson said. 1:59 WHO requests information about respiratory illness spike in China’s youth population Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta Hospital, said there were lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic that can be used in a season of heightened influenza levels. Story continues below advertisement “If you’re about to go into a social situation in a smaller, enclosed space with a whole bunch of people and some of them are quite elderly or have medical compromise, you might want to rethink the space and the time for that, or spread out the visits with smaller groups over a larger time, or at least pay some attention to ventilation,” she said.

Language rights take spotlight at Quebec Liberal Party convention Activist who climbed Jacques-Cartier Bridge speaks out “If you are going to be visiting elderly people in long term care or something, because that’s when you do that, masking remains important and people often forget hand-washing actually really does help too,” she said.While the very old and the very young tend to have weaker immune systems that are more susceptible to severe outcomes from infections, Saxinger said the H1N1 family of influenza viruses is known to produce worse for younger populations.“I just checked the hospitalized flu case breakdown by age and indeed it has flipped. So last year, the highest group was 65-plus, and this year the highest group is 18 to 65 years old,” she said.She said the hospital capacity situation this year is much different than 2009, with hospitals around Alberta already under high stress. Story continues below advertisement “Hospitalization numbers tend to peak a little bit later (than the peak of case counts),” she said. “People who have a complicated course may end up staying in hospital for a while, and that could really create some issues when we’re already running kind of like 110 per cent in many of our hospitals.“Making more space is really challenging. And so it is a bit of a worry, I’ll be honest.” Walk-ups available One pharmacist told Global News there’s so much supply of influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations that many of his colleagues are able to help people on a walk-in basis.Vishal Sukhadaya, pharmacist and owner of a Medicine Shoppe in Lethbridge, likened vaccinations to a first line of defence. Trending Now How Canadian consumers can spot counterfeit $2 coins RCMP report reveals new details on GTA man and his ‘camel-toe’ fake toonies “The vaccines actually train our immune cells how to fight with actual viruses. If we don’t have any training, we won’t be able to fight with the viruses accordingly,” he said. Story continues below advertisement “This year, surprisingly, the flu vaccination rate is substantially low compared to last year. So we are seeing many flu cases and we have actually a few patients who are dealing with severe complications.“I would encourage everyone to just get the vaccination done at their closest pharmacy.”Saxinger said she expects there to be a higher than normal population of Albertans who are vulnerable to influenza, perhaps because of a loss of community-level immunity.“I’m not sure that the influenza vaccine campaign really got a lot of traction this year. It didn’t seem super visible,” the infectious diseases specialist said. 4:38 B.C. officials provide update on respiratory illness levels as holiday season kicks into high gear B.C. officials provide update on respiratory illness levels as holiday season kicks into high gear COVID-19: Ontario wastewater signal hits 1-year peak COVID-19 cases on the rise in Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox & Addington Previous Video Next Video According to the province’s dashboard, only 22.1 per cent of Albertans have received an influenza shot, making it the second-lowest coverage rate since 2009. Story continues below advertisement In the 2009-10 influenza season (which runs from autumn to autumn), 36 per cent of Albertans were immunized by the end of May 2010.That was following the World Health Organization’s declaration of the swine flu pandemic in 2009. The province’s report reviewing that pandemic said record levels of coverage in many populations, including high-risk and Indigenous populations, were achieved due to public health officials delivering vastly more influenza shots using tactics like mass immunization clinics.It was only in the 2020-21 flu season that Alberta broke the 2009-10 high-water mark of vaccinations.Saxinger was quick to note that people cannot get sick with influenza from the vaccine.“There’s no actual virus involved in the vaccine that you’re given,” she said. “It’s just sub-units.”Saxinger noted that Albertans over 65 with a medical condition or who are immunocompromised can be eligible for prescriptions to treat an influenza or COVID infection.“In both cases the treatment is best if started early. And so if people are beginning to become ill and they know that there’s been a horrible fever, cough illness that they’ve been exposed to, that’s probably influenza and they should consider getting tested and treated because there is useful treatment that can help keep people out of trouble.” Story continues below advertisement According the province’s dashboard, there have been 1,097 hospitalizations, 132 intensive care admissions and 34 deaths due to influenza this influenza season. The youngest death was an Albertan in their 30s, which was recorded this month.The year of the swine flu pandemic, 64 Albertans died of that disease, 1,276 were hospitalized and 240 were admitted to ICU.Public health officials say it takes on average about two weeks for antibodies to be produced following an immunization.This fall, new formulas for flu and COVID-19 shots have been formulated to address strains most likely to be in circulation.“It’s not too late for your flu shot,” Gregson said, looking ahead to the Christmas break.

Two Stanislaus County farms experience avian flu outbreaks Two chicken farms in Stanislaus County had to euthanize their flocks due to an outbreak of avian flu (Photo contributed). The California Department of Food and Agriculture confirmed last week that a pair of commercial farms in Stanislaus County experienced highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks. The fast-spreading virus — also known as avian flu or bird flu — has forced the two farms to quarantine and euthanize their birds to prevent further spread of the disease. The names of the two farms were not released, although the CDFA shared that they each raise an estimated 250,000 chickens. The outbreaks in Stanislaus County came just four days after an outbreak was reported in Sonoma County and a week after the disease was detected in Fresno County. In late October, Canada geese were found dead in Sacramento County and submitted to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s (CDFW) Wildlife Health Laboratory for testing. It was confirmed in November that they died from the Eurasian strain of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1. Detections in waterfowl during hunter-harvest surveillance have been reported from Fresno, Glenn, Kern and Yolo counties. Prior to these detections, the last confirmed detection in wild birds occurred in June 2023. This strain of Eurasian HPAI H5N1 has been circulating in the United States and Canada since the winter of 2021-22, arriving in California in mid-July 2022. In total, 354 confirmed detections of the virus were made in wild birds collected from 44 California counties during mortality surveillance conducted between July 2022 and June 2023. Detections of the virus appeared to subside during spring and summer in California, as well as more broadly in the United States. Now, as waterfowl and other waterbirds are undertaking fall migration, cases again are on the rise. Like with humans, there is a flu season for birds, with some forms worse than others. The bird flu is found in some populations of wild waterfowl that can infect chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese and guinea fowl, as well as a wide variety of other domesticated and wild birds. Spread is normally caused by domestic bird-to-bird contact or through contact with contaminated people, feed or equipment once it is introduced into domestic avian populations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the strain detected in Stanislaus County is considered a low risk to human health, however, avian influenza is highly contagious and often fatal for birds. The CDFA notes that, with the avian flu being widespread across California, it may also be present in other counties that are not yet flagged due to there being no laboratory submissions from the counties. The agency stressed that enhanced biosecurity is critical in the face of ongoing disease outbreaks, and urged farms to continue to practice good avian biosecurity protocols. Community members are encouraged to report any unusual or suspicious sick or dead domestic birds immediately through the CDFA Sick Bird Hotline at (866) 922-2473. Any unusual or suspicious wild bird deaths can also be reported online to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) at www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Laboratories/Wildlife-Health/Monitoring/Mortality-Report.

Trends of the week: COVID-19: increase in the number of cases of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): slight increase in the number of RSV cases. Influenza: sharp rise in the number of cases. COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 From 4 to 10 December 2023 (week 49), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 increased to 658 cases, compared to 460 cases the previous week (+43%). The positivity rate rose to 28% compared with 26% the previous week. The viral concentration detected in wastewater fall slightly [1]. The latest sequencing data available show a preponderance of the BA.2.86 variant (44%) followed by the XBB.1.9 variant (30%) [2]. Influenza For the week of 4 to 10 December 2023 (week 49), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories increased to 134 cases compared to 51 cases in the previous week, an increase of 163% compared to the previous week. These data largely coincide with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates increased circulation of SARS-CoV-2, rhinovirus and RSV. Sentinel surveillance also confirms an increase in the circulation of the influenza virus [2]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 4 to 10 December 2023 (week 49), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals detected by the CHL laboratory rose to 134 cases, compared with 116 the previous week, presenting an increase of 16%. Vaccination: a preventive measure against respiratory infections Vaccination is an effective way of protecting against respiratory infections and the serious complications that can arise from them.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare on Dec. 15 said the number of new influenza cases reported from Dec. 4 to Dec. 10 at around 5,000 designated medical institutions nationwide came to 166,690. The figure is 1.26 times higher than the previous week’s number. The national average per institution was 33.72 cases, surpassing the benchmark 30 cases for “alert level” for the first time this season, indicating the suspected occurrence or continuation of a major outbreak. Officials said the alert level number nationwide was reached for the first time since the 2018-2019 season, before the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Typically, the alert level is reached in January or February. Current figures exceeded the alert level at a speed second only to the crisis outbreak in 2009. The number of cases increased in all prefectures compared to the previous week, with 33 prefectures surpassing the alert level. In a typical year, influenza outbreaks tend to subside by spring, but this season represents a continuation of the outbreak that flared in December last year, officials said. The number of cases had already exceeded the caution level of 10 in October.

Ministry urges enhanced prevention of avian influenza Facing the complicated development of the avian influenza epidemic in localities in Cambodia bordering the southwest border of Vietnam, the Ministry of Health today sent an official dispatch to people's committees of provinces and cities on strengthened prevention of avian influenza transmission to humans. To proactively prevent bird flu from spreading into Vietnam and infecting humans, the Ministry of Health recommended that localities strengthen strict supervision of travelers and immigrants into the country for early detection of suspected cases of the disease, especially those who slaughter, trade poultry and live poultry products, and people with a history of coming from areas with epidemics including epidemics in poultry and humans. Furthermore, health workers should take samples and send them to the Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology or the Pasteur Institute for timely tests as well as isolation to prevent the disease from spreading to the community. The health sector in cities and provinces should strengthen surveillance of cases of acute respiratory infections, severe viral pneumonia syndrome and influenza syndrome to promptly detect cases of influenza A/H5N1 The Ministry of Health also proposed that provincial and municipal authorities liaise with health agencies and veterinary agencies closely with the aim to monitor and detect influenza epidemics in poultry, especially at border gates and live poultry markets in addition to prompt information sharing to thoroughly handle outbreaks. Last but not least, local administrations should increase communications on measures to prevent transmission of bird flu to humans in areas with sick and dead poultry and high-risk areas. Drugs, medical supplies, and chemicals must be prepared enough to support localities in implementing measures to handle outbreaks. According to the Ministry of Health, the Cambodian Ministry of Health has recorded 22 additional cases of people infected with influenza A/H5N1 in Kampot Province from November 23 until now. So far, from the beginning of 2023 until now, Cambodia has recorded 6 cases of influenza A/H5N1 infection, including three deaths. Along with that, the Department of Animal Health under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said that currently in the country, poultry flu epidemics still occur in different localities. Additionally, weather is currently changing posing unprecedented threats to human health that are conducive to the development of avian influenza virus. At the same time, people are tending to increase poultry herds to prepare for the upcoming Lunar New Year in 2024, so poultry transportation and trading activities may increase, always posing a potential risk of bird flu virus infection in humans.

The vaccines are being purchased from local stores and administered at home under doctor's advice. Demand for pneumonia vaccines has increased by 20% at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS). Woodlands Hospital has also reported a marked increase in pneumonia vaccination. BP Poddar Hospital has seen a drastic rise in pneumonia and influenza cases, with 139 doses of vaccines administered as a precautionary step. KOLKATA: A spurt in both pneumonia and influenza has led to a scamper for vaccines against the diseases, especially among the elderly population in Kolkata. Several private hospitals and clinics have seen a rush for pneumonia and influenza vaccines since November end, and enquiries are still pouring in. Many are buying the vaccines from local stores and get their family members vaccinated at home under doctorâs advice.Pneumonia vaccine is a one-time inoculation believed to provide protection for several years.The disease proves to be the leading cause of death in winter, triggered by temperature fluctuations and rise in pollution. Influenza vaccines, on the other hand, have to be taken every year.Almost all hospitals have seen a major spike in the number of patients with asthma, COPD or respiratory tract infection, with a significant number, especially senior citizens, contracting pneumonia. âThose with asthma, lung ailments or a structural lung disease should take the pneumonia vaccine since temperature fluctuations and pollution have already unleashed a range of viruses that are potentially life-threatening. We have seen a spike in vaccinations, although pneumonia vaccines, unlike the influenza ones, can be taken at any time of the year,â said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chowdhury. He added that even though influenza vaccines are advised during the onset of monsoon, when various forms of the disease strike, there is a rush to get them this winter. Even though itâs a part of routine vaccination, demand for pneumonia vaccines has gone up by 20% at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), according to Narayana Hospitals COO R Venkatesh. Woodlands Hospital, too, has seen a âmarked increaseâ in pneumonia vaccination over the last week. âOne vaccine is being administered every day on an average. Many enquiries are still coming in,â said CEO and MD Rupali Basu. In the last seven to eight days, BP Poddar Hospital has seen a drastic rise in pneumonia and influenza cases. âWe started giving vulnerable patients pneumococcal and influenza vaccines from October. Till mid-November, we have given a combined 139 doses of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines as a precautionary step,â said Supriyo Chakrabarty, group CEO, BP Poddar Hospital.BP Poddar has started a dedicated chest clinic where patients are being vaccinated while their existing symptoms are treated. âIn the last seven days, till Wednesday, we have vaccinated 84 people â patients with mild symptoms and a history of pneumonia. But patients with severe symptoms canât take the vaccine,â Chakrabarty said. BP Poddar now has 54 pneumonia patients and its ITUs and ICUs are fully occupied. Peerless Hospital has been administering the pneumonia vaccine to eight to 10 recipients a week and the pneumonia vaccine to around five. âThis is almost double of what we see throughout the year,â said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Charnock Hospital has started counselling patients with chest and respiratory infections to go for vaccines. CMRI Hospital pulmonology director Raja Dhar said a clutch of viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), meta-pneumo virus, rhinovirus and adenovirus, are let loose at this time of the year and lead to a proliferation of patients with respiratory illness. âThis typically begins in November and continues till February,â he said.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous15 high protein breakfast dishes made without eggsFood8 yoga poses that help reduce lower back pain quicklyLifestyleâFascinating Prairie dogs that live under the groundâLifestyle10 curd-based Indian dishes that are super-healthyFood10 popular Korean chicken dishes to tryFoodEasy tips to motivate your child to focus on studiesLifestyle8 rare freshwater fishes for home aquariumsLifestyleTop wildlife safaris for tiger spotting in Septembertravelâ10 powerful birds of preyâLifestyleâSonarika Bhadoria dazzles in graceful traditional looksEntertainment Next123Hot PicksHarris Trump Debate HighlightsWhat is Project 2025?PM Modi Noida VisitWho is Ilhan OmarMalaika Arora FatherCentral Park 5 Case ExplainedGod of Chaos AsteroidTOP TRENDINGWho is Donald HarrisTaylor Swift Endorses Kamala HarrisMaldives President Mohamed MuizzuApple iPhone 16WWE Wrestlers who Married other WrestlersSanjauli Mosque RowJasprit BumrahPM Narendra ModiNagpur Audi CrashGST Council MeetTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteEarthquake of magnitude 5.8 strikes Pakistan, tremors felt in Delhi, neighbouring areasWho were Barack Obama's challengers in 2008 and 2012 US presidential elections?'A in INDIA alliance': Rahul Gandhi's slip-up during address to Indian-Americans goes viralTrump vs Harris: Betting markets reveal whoâs expected to win the US presidential debateIGNOU December 2024 Term-End Exam: Registration Details, Important Dates, and Fee StructureTop 10 TED Talks to Boost Confidence and Success for Female StudentsCase against British Indian woman for Hindu prayers on beach collapsesChina refuses to sign agreement to ban AI from controlling nuclear weapons'Not merely due to diet ...': Tammy Slaton on her weight loss journey after losing 226 kgHappy Teachers' Day: 8 most influential educators from the pages of historyKolkata actor lodges complaint over 'kiss without consent';

Key findings The number of samples tested remains low, but is still more than three times higher than a year ago. The coronavirus positivity rate has jumped after a slump a week ago, with over 72% of patients hospitalised with SARI treated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. For the first time in the current flu season, a handful of people infected by influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) also needed hospital care. The number of people hospitalised with SARI and those in intensive care dropped slightly from a week ago. The flu season generally peaks between the 7th and 10th week of the year, but the highest figures can vary greatly from one year to another. The coronavirus pandemic, for instance, put a serious dent into the spread of the flu (see graph below). The start of this year's flu season does not look promising at all on this particular chart, although the sharp rise flattened slightly on the 49th week. On the 49th week, a total of 262,600 people sought medical help with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), of whom 31,100 (11.8%) had flu-like symptoms. The former figure marks a 5.2% increase over the 48th week and the latter a 7.6% rise, which come come after way sharper rises of 18-45% from the 45th week. The dip in the columns came on the back of two short weeks, with public holidays on 1 Nov and 23 Oct., when fewer people went to the doctor, and the autumn break in schools also helped in this respect. The graph below allows a comparison with weeks 40 to 49 of 2022, showing higher figures for this year for both the number of SARI "patients" and those that visited GPs with flu-like symptoms. We can also compare the SARI and flu numbers for 100,000 inhabitants. These charts will say more when we have more than just a couple weeks of data, but - unlike up to the 46th week - they suggest that the flu season might be more severe in 2023/24 than in 2022/23. We need to highlight that this year authorities perform way more tests than a year ago, even though the number of samples tested remains extremely low (317 in total on a national level last week, up by a hair from 310 a week earlier). The number of samples tested on the 49th week was only a tad higher than on the 48th week, with the COVID-19 positivity rate up sharply. Testing is almost non-existent and we may draw only extremely cautious conclusions from these findings as regards the bigger picture on the current epidemiological situation. This is basically the only set of Covid data authorities provide besides weekly wastewater sampling results. As regards all samples tested up to the 49th week, the Covid positivity rate continues to stand out. As authorities have been publishing separate SARI and flu statistics only since 2022, a longer-term comparison is possible only for the number of people seeking medical help with influenza-like symptoms. This is basically a magnification of the first ten weeks of the flu season depicted on very first graph above. There were 252 people in hospital with SARI on the 49th week, versus 266 a week earlier. Almost three quarters (72.2%) of them were treated with COVID-19, up slightly from 71.8% a week earlier. Coronavirus was the main pathogen found in samples early in the flu season last year too. Actually, the first time the share of flu viruses in samples was higher than the share of SARS-CoV-2 occurred only at the start of this year in the 2022/23 flu season. For the first time in this flu season, however, people tested positive for influenza virus and RSV also had to be hospitalised. The 47th week was the first one in this cold season when one of the samples showed influenza infection (up at 17 in total by the end of the 49th week). Other pathogens identified between the 40th and 49th week were SARS-CoV-2 (607), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 4), adenovirus (1), parainfluenza (3), human metapneumovirus (HMPV, 5), and rhinovirus (24). 114 (62.6%) of the 182 COVID-19 patients were aged 60 and over, which compares with 147 (77.0%) a week ago. The other two metrics, i.e. people in hospital with Covid, and 60+ Covid patients, show a decline from the previous week, -5.7% and -22%, respectively. 22.2% of those hospitalised with SARI were children aged 2 years or younger, while more than half of them were aged 60 and over. The first figure marks an increase, the latter a decline from a week ago. There was an increase in the number of the former (green columns) and a drop in the latter group (orange columns). Another important indicator of the severity of an epidemic is how many of those hospitalised end up in the intensive care unit (or in the morgue for that matter). The NNK does not reveal mortality stats, though. As mentioned above, there were 252 people with SARI in hospital on the week under review, down from 266 a week earlier. 27 of them were in the ICU, which corresponds to a 10.7% ratio, up slightly from 10.5% a week earlier. Finally, we have an age breakdown both for SARI and flu patients. Children up to the age of 14 are on top of the SARI age rankings in terms of numbers, while they are only on the 3rd spot in the flu rankings, behind those between 35 and 59 and the hardest-hit 15-34 age group. The right-hand charts show the share of people with SARI and flu-like symptoms by age group. Looking back on the 2022/23 data we find that the 0-14 age group was the hardest hit throughout the flu season in terms of SARI, while in terms of flu-like symptoms they were the most affected age group between the 3rd and the 15th week of this year, i.e. from mid-January to mid-April.

With the festive season on the horizon, caution is advised! On December 8, the Agence Régionale de Santé (ARS – Regional Health Authority) issued a warning concerning the influenza virus, which is spreading quickly in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region .Advertising »Advertising Between November 28 and December 4, the ARS registered 240 visits to hospital emergency departments, compared to 125 the previous week, almost half of which were by under-15s. The authority also identified 649 consultations with SOS Médecins, compared to 489 the previous week. The epidemic phase was therefore announced for the region. The ARS stresses that seasonal flu “can be serious for frail individuals. In France, it affects between two and six million people every year, with hospitalisation and death of several thousand vulnerable people, mostly aged 65 and over.” “A flu epidemic means an average of 31,000 flu-related respiratory hospital admissions, 70% of which are for people aged 65 and over,” warns the ARS.Advertising » Prevention rather than cure Given the surge in case numbers, the ARS is urging the most vulnerable people to get vaccinated as soon as possible. These include the over 65s, pregnant women, people with certain chronic illnesses and those with obesity (BMI of 40 or over). The ARS has also noted a drop in seasonal flu vaccinations compared to the 2021-2022 campaign (a shortfall of between 12 and 14% in the PACA region). In Monaco, the cost of the vaccination is 100% covered by the Principality’s social security system. The Assurance Maladie (French national health insurance system) will send out a reminder by email, SMS or voice message (depending on stated contact preferences) to anyone who was issued with a vaccine reimbursement voucher by post, but for whom no vaccine reimbursement was registered as at end November. Pregnant women are not included in the reminder campaign, but their midwife, doctor, pharmacist or nurse can issue them with a 100% reimbursement voucher enabling them to collect the vaccine free of charge from a pharmacy. They can then be vaccinated by one of those health professionals.Advertising » In addition to vaccinations, the ARS recommends that people take the following preventive measures: Wear a mask Do not shake hands or kiss when greeting others Wash your hands Air rooms Cough and sneeze into your elbow Tags: Editor's choice News Society Health Related articles: Story“We almost had a tragedy”: woman in 70s collides with motorbike30 October 2024StoryJustice In briefSPA de Monaco: Meeko, Lucie and others are looking for a new family29 October 2024In briefCharities StorySuspended sentence for man who assaulted Arthur Leclerc in brother Charles’ car23 October 2024StoryJustice StoryThe school of tomorrow in Monaco: attractiveness and new technologies4 October 2024StoryYouth In briefSuicide suspected after tragic incident at Monaco station2 October 2024In briefFaits Divers In briefFood safety: certain Principality establishments fined1 October 2024In briefJustice Latest articles FeatureThree takeaways from AS Monaco’s stirring victory over RC StrasbourgFeatureAS Monaco ReviewLigue 1: Thrilling late flurry powers AS Monaco to victory over StrasbourgReviewAS Monaco CompetitionPreview: Hutter looks ahead to tough Strasbourg tripCompetitionAS Monaco PhotosStorm Alex: Prince Albert II inaugurates restorations of valleys’ historic heritagePhotosPrince Albert II Most read these past 30 days InterviewEverybodyCounts, mastering maths one country at a timeInterviewEducation PhotosPrincess Caroline and daughters Charlotte Casiraghi and Alexandra of Hanover sublime at Monaco’s Opéra GarnierPhotosPrincess Caroline In briefMonaco hosts world’s first yachting industry summitIn briefEvents Follow Monaco Tribune NEWSLETTER MonacoTribune straight to your inbox?

News What’s Going Around: RSV, flu, COVID, ear infections by: Ali Lanyon Posted: Dec 14, 2023 / 04:30 AM EST Updated: Dec 14, 2023 / 05:05 AM EST by: Ali Lanyon Posted: Dec 14, 2023 / 04:30 AM EST Updated: Dec 14, 2023 / 05:05 AM EST SHARE WellSpan Pediatric Medicine Physicians across the Midstate are seeing RSV, COVID and asthma exacerbations. The providers at UPMC Children’s Community Pediatrics in York and Spring Grove are continuing to see flu, RSV and viral illness this week. They are also seeing COVID-19 and strep throat. The CVS MinuteClinic in York reports a slight increase in flu cases. They continue to see cases of COVID and viral upper respiratory infections. They’re also seeing secondary bacterial infections, such as ear and sinus infections. This week, pediatricians at Penn State Health have seen an increase in patients with RSV, as well as an increase in patients with COVID. They are also seeing patients with the flu, strep throat, bronchitis, a lot of colds, and some stomach bug. Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health Physicians Roseville Pediatrics reports a lot of RSV in all age groups. Younger toddlers and infants are sometimes getting bronchiolitis from it, but not always. Older kids and adults typically have a bad cold with a pretty wet cough. RSV and other viruses have been causing a ton of secondary ear infections. They have seen a small rise in strep and COVID cases. Flu cases are still pretty low but they did see an increase in viral stomach bugs. There’s also been an influenza-like illness that is negative on all viral testing but acts like the flu, with fevers for three to five days, body aches, headache and sore throat. They are also still seeing hand, foot and mouth cases despite the season. Hand, foot and mouth is typically seen in warmer months. Dr. Joan Thode offered the following advice about RSV: “RSV is a virus that causes upper respiratory symptoms, as well as an increased inflammatory response in the lungs, particularly the lining of the air tubes. In infants and younger toddlers, this can cause mucous plugging in the tiniest airways, known as bronchiolitis. While not every case of bronchiolitis is problematic, in some cases, the inflammation is widespread enough to prevent inhaled oxygen from getting to the bloodstream adequately. To tell if your child is in oxygen deficit, watch the effort and rate of their breathing. The brain and body have methods to increase the oxygen processing in the lungs with an increased breathing rate and breath volume. These methods, though, require a lot more energy. To get more air volume into the lungs, the body will use the ribcage muscles to forcefully expand the lungs with every breath. The child’s belly will protrude with each breath, and there will be an exaggerated expansion of the ribcage, known as retractions. Sustained fast breathing or retractions are concerning signs that warrant medical evaluation to ensure we can give the child more oxygen if they need it, and that they don’t tire out with the extra energy expenditure. Testing positive for RSV is by no means a guarantee of respiratory distress; it often causes a severe cold and congestion, but most babies and kids weather the storm as they would any other virus. The key is not the name of the virus but rather how the body fights it and whether the inflammation causes an increased rate and work of breathing.” Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

PHOTO: ST FILE Salma KhalikSenior Health Correspondent Updated Dec 13, 2023, 09:03 PM Published Dec 12, 2023, 03:20 PM More Whatsapp Linkedin Twitter FB Messenger Email Print Purchase Article Copy permalinkCopy to clipboard https://str.sg/iYkC SINGAPORE - Doctors are calling on people to get vaccinated and to mask up, to reduce the usual year-end increase in acute respiratory infections, which include Covid-19, influenza and the common cold. Both Healthway Medical, the largest general practice chain with more than 120 clinics, and Parkway Shenton, with 55 GP clinics, say they have seen a 30 per cent increase in respiratory infections. Raffles Medical, with 43 GP clinics, has also noticed increases in such ailments. The latest Ministry of Health (MOH) data for the week ending Dec 2 showed an average of 2,970 cases a day seen at Singapore’s 25 polyclinics – against a five-year median of 2,009 daily cases for 2018 to 2022 for this time of the year. While this is lower than the 3,000 to 3,500 a day in the pre-pandemic years, it comes on the back of almost three years of low infection rates due to precautions taken against Covid-19. In 2020 and 2021, polyclinics were seeing fewer than 1,000 cases a day in early December. Polyclinics treat about 20 per cent of acute cases in the primary care setting, with the 1,800 GP clinics handling the rest. For the same week, more than 32,000 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 – 460 were hospitalised and nine needed intensive care. This has added significantly to the bed crunch at public hospitals. Professor Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases expert at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: “During this holiday season, as upper respiratory tract infections – including Covid-19 cases – rise, it is important to be mindful of others. Wear a mask in crowded places, stay home if you’re unwell, and get the latest flu jab as well as a Covid-19 booster to avoid disrupting your travel plans.” Dr Jonathan Tan, a family physician at Healthway, said: “We usually see more respiratory infections during the year end. However, this year, we are seeing an even larger increase in the number of upper respiratory tract infections. Fortunately, the majority of cases are mild and can be treated in an outpatient setting.” He, too, advises staying updated with influenza and Covid-19 vaccinations and to mask up, especially in crowded places, as this can reduce the chances of catching air-borne bugs. Covid-19 vaccines are free in Singapore, as is the influenza vaccine for those who have signed up for Healthier SG, the national scheme introduced in 2023 to encourage people to stick to one family doctor who can provide preventive care to keep them healthy. The actual number of people with influenza is relatively low, with the majority suffering from the common cold. The MOH, which tracks influenza infections to spot possible pandemics, said: “The proportion of patients with influenza-like illness among the polyclinic attendances for acute respiratory infection is 0.5 per cent.” Out of this small number with influenza-like illness, only 11.5 per cent tested positive for the flu virus over the past four weeks. Dr Tan said people who feel sick should promptly test for Covid-19 at home. If they test positive, there is the option of taking antiviral medications such as Paxlovid. This will reduce the severity of symptoms. Remote video URL More On This Topic Public should not hoard ART kits; pharmacies and stores have sufficient supply: MOH Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms urged to visit clinics to ease hospital bed crunch Dr Edwin Chng, Parkway Shenton’s medical director, gave similar advice, adding that those with risk factors, such as the elderly and those with weak immune systems, should see a doctor for proper assessment. He said people should practise good hygiene – which most people were doing during the pandemic years – such as handwashing and not touching their face with their hands, as this could spread diseases like the common cold, Covid-19 and the flu. Dr Chng Shih Kiat, medical director at Raffles Medical, said some patients seen at its clinics needed to be prescribed antivirals, though the majority of patients had relatively mild symptoms. He advised people to stay healthy with a balanced diet and adequate intake of fruits and vegetables. “It is also important to get ample rest and stay hydrated. Exercise regularly, but do not overexert with overzealous exercise routines. When travelling, wear a mask, especially in crowded places.” More On This Topic askST: I tested positive for Covid-19.

Page Content​​​​​​​​Fall and winter are the time of year when we expect to see more respiratory illnesses circulating in British Columbia. We should all be familiar with the steps we can take to protect ourselves and others, prevent spreading sickness, and manage symptoms when we’re at home. The BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) works with health system partners, including the Provincial Health Services Authority and regional health authorities, to collect and analyze information from different sources to give us a picture of respiratory virus activity throughout the province. SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) activity has been stable since October, but influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are currently rising.“What we’re seeing this year is an increase in influenza and RSV activity, returning to levels we used to see before the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Dr. Aamir Bharmal, a Public Health Physician and Medical Director of the Public Health Response Division at BCCDC.​“Some of the key things we look at are how many people are getting sick and having severe illness, how many people are going into their doctors for respiratory symptoms and what we’re getting from the lab data − what types of viruses are coming up.” The BCCDC recently updated its data tool for respiratory viruses​, making it easier to see which viruses are circulating in different communities and whether there are increases in infection or serious illness. Dr. Hind Sbihi is the Director of Data Science and Innovation in BCCDC’s Data and Analytics Services area, a team that helped establish the surveillance platform and contributes to the weekly reports.“We have the laboratory infrastructure across B.C. to test for a variety of respiratory pathogens, and on the dashboard, we present summed up test counts,” says Dr. Sbihi, adding that the Public Health Laboratory (PHL) also sequences the genes of different viruses to help identify which strains are infecting people. “We’re able to use the dashboard to communicate on the subtypes of viruses that are circulating,” says Dr. Agatha Jassem, Program Head of the Virology Lab at the PHL. “This is important information, as it can affect patient management and inform vaccine strain match.” The data are updated every Thursday from November to April, when respiratory infections are more common. Regular updates allow people and communities who could be significantly affected by these viruses to stay informed of their risk. The dashboard is also a tool for public health, provincial government and regional health authorities to monitor trends, identify outbreaks and be ready to act to help keep people safe.“The dashboards have both key messages and data-rich visuals,” says Dr. Natalie Prystajecky, the Program Head for Environmental Microbiology at the PHL. “This makes it easy for those who want the “Coles Notes,” and offers in-depth analysis for those who want more detailed information.” An infographic created by the Knowledge Translation and Public Health Response teams shows how the data tool works. Select the image to view the full PDF document.Wastewater data on flu and RSV available to the public Ahead of respiratory illness season, the BCCDC Public Health Laboratory and Wastewater Surveillance Team expanded their ongoing testing of wastewater for SARS CoV-2. The project started during the pandemic and previously covered the Lower Mainland, but the lab now receives samples​ from water treatment plants throughout the province. The wastewater project team has rolled out a new testing protocol to detect levels of the two mains strains of flu and RSV, in addition to ongoing monitoring of the virus that causes COVID-19.“It’s really all about the accessibility of health data,” says Dr. Prystajecky, explaining that a blend of key messages, sophisticated analytics and user-friendly visualizations make it easy for anyone living in B.C. to consult the data tool and see what’s happening in their area. While BCCDC, PHL and the regional health authorities continuously monitor the common illnesses we see every year, Dr. Linda Hoang, Medical Director of the PHL, says she and her team keep an eye out for new and emerging pathogens that aren’t included in the dashboard but could still spread to B.C.“Mycoplasma pneumoniae, for example, is a hot topic this ye​ar,” says Dr. Hoang, explaining that the public health lab watches for unusual trends in B.C. and the possibility of antimicrobial resistance in the pathogens they’re monitoring.​Tips to stay healthy this respiratory illness seasonDr. Bharmal says this year’s influenza vaccines appear to closely match the strains of influenza that are currently circulating in B.C. and emphasizes the importance of getting vaccinated. He says everyone six months and older should get a flu shot and additional doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, but it’s especially beneficial for children, as many younger children weren’t previously exposed to different strains of influenza during the pandemic. Vaccines are also strongly recommended for older people with health complications, people who are immunocompromised, and anyone in regular contact with those at higher risk.Here are a few things you can do to help limit the spread of respiratory illness over the holidays and in the coming months: Get immunized​ – this is the best way to prevent serious illnessEveryone registered with the Get Vaccinated system will receive an invitation to book an appointment for the updated COVID-19 and influenza vaccinesStay at home if you’re feeling sickIf you have any symptoms of respiratory illness and must leave your home, practice respiratory etiquette:Wear a mask in indoor public spacesCough and sneeze into your elbowClean your hands regularlyAvoid touching your face, especially your eyes, mouth and noseIf you’re sick, stay away from people at higher risk of serious illness BC Centre for Disease Control It looks like your browser does not have JavaScript enabled.

It's been nearly three weeks since the start of flu season was officially declared in Canada and we're beginning to see cases surging in some regions, at the same time as COVID-19 cases are trending higher and higher. Top health headlines, all in one place Levels of influenza in Alberta right now are the highest they've been in 14 years. Data out of British Columbia is showing a rise in both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). And the number of flu cases showing up in Manitoba hospitals is putting a strain on the health-care system, Manitoba Health Minister Uzoma Asagwara said Thursday. Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, wrote in a statement Thursday that "respiratory illness season is well underway in Canada," and that influenza, RSV and COVID-19 are all circulating right now. "If you haven't already done so, now is a good time to get your updated flu and COVID-19 vaccines." John Papastergiou, a pharmacist based in Toronto, told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview that the flu shot shouldn't be an afterthought. "Every year, the flu causes significant morbidity and even mortality to many Canadians," he said. "The most vulnerable, obviously, are the young and the very old, but really it can affect all of us. The only real way to combat it is to get vaccinated to protect our elderly – we protect our young family members – and obviously, to protect yourself." He added that getting vaccinated as early as possible within the flu season is important in order to get ahead of the swell of cases, and that we'll be approaching that peak soon. 'LONG FLU' STUDY A study published Thursday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases suggests that influenza could create a long-term burden akin to long COVID on a less drastic scale. The study looked at 81,000 patients in the U.S. hospitalized for COVID-19 between 2020 and 2022, as well as nearly 11,000 patients hospitalized for seasonal influenza at some point between 2015 and 2019, and tracked their progress up to 18 months post-infection. "Five years ago, it wouldn't have occurred to me to examine the possibility of a 'long flu,'" Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., and senior author of the study, said in a press release. "A major lesson we learned from SARS-CoV-2 is that an infection that initially was thought to only cause brief illness also can lead to chronic disease." The data confirmed that COVID-19 was significantly more deadly than the flu, with patients who had COVID-19 facing a 50 per cent higher risk of death, as well as a much larger risk of 64 different health conditions across all organ systems. Top coronavirus headlines, all in one place However, it also showed that the flu was capable of causing long-term damage that increased patients' risk of developing six different health conditions later in life, mostly in the respiratory system. "The big answer is that both COVID-19 and the flu led to long-term health problems," Al-Aly said. "Long COVID is much more of a health problem than COVID, and long flu is much more of a health problem than the flu." Papastergiou called the research "not surprising at all," stating that damage done during the acute phase of an illness makes the body more vulnerable to future illnesses. "Once you've had a bad case of influenza, or COVID, we know definitively that puts you at risk for future cases," he said. "I think it's not surprising when you have something like influenza, or pneumonia related to influenza, it's a massive inflammatory cascade, as well. And there's consequences to that down the line potentially – cardiovascular disease risk and everything else." That's one of the reasons that vaccination is so important, he said. FLU SHOT MYTHS Those at risk of developing a severe case of influenza tend to be the same groups at high risk for severe cases of COVID-19: those who are pregnant, have underlying health conditions, are immunosuppressed or are 65 years or older. Young children are also at a high risk for serious cases of influenza, especially children aged six months to five years old, which is not the case with COVID-19. The flu shot drastically reduces the likelihood of developing a severe case and ending up in hospital with influenza, Papastergiou said. "This year, I'm seeing a little more hesitancy towards the flu shot than I have in previous years," he said. "A lot of the myths now are 'I've already been vaccinated for COVID and flu in the past, I don't need it again this year,' (or) 'I've got too many vaccines over the last little while, that can't be good.'" The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App But the flu shot is different every year, optimized for whichever strain of influenza that researchers predict to be the most dominant based on Australia's flu season, which occurs before ours. And health experts recommend getting the flu shot every year, regardless of how recently you got a COVID-19 shot. At Papastergiou's work at a Shopper's Drug Mart in Toronto, around half of their patients are receiving their COVID-19 booster shot and their flu shot during the same appointment, usually one in the right arm and one in the left. "We're really recommending co-administration with the COVID booster, the newest version," he said. It's perfectly safe to get both at the same time, but could leave you feeling a little more achy for the next 24 hours or so, he added. Health Canada has authorized three XBB.1.5 vaccines, which are able to target newer variants of COVID-19, and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is urging all Canadians to get their updated boosters amid increased COVID-19 activity this fall. TRIPLE THREAT SEASON During the first year of the pandemic, influenza all but vanished in Canada — rates of flu were so low in 2020-21, with only 66 confirmed cases compared to the usual more than 43,000, that there technically was no actual flu season because cases never were high enough to reach the threshold to declare one. This immense drop was connected largely to the public health measures that had been put in place to combat COVID-19, namely mask-wearing and physical distancing. As health measures eased before vanishing completely, flu rates have gone back up. This year, Papastergiou is anticipating a larger flu season similar to pre-pandemic levels. He says those who are immunocompromised should definitely wear masks in settings where there's a lot of people in close contact. "The benefits of the masks are well documented," he said. "They reduce the incidence of both flu, COVID and other respiratory illnesses." PHAC is also recommending mask-wearing this flu season. In her statement Thursday, Tam said that measures to reduce your risk of getting or spreading respiratory illnesses include "properly wearing a high quality, well-fitting respirator or mask in indoor public places, regular hand hygiene and improving indoor ventilation." If you do come down with the flu, it's important to stay home if you're able in order to avoid passing it on to others. Over the counter cold medicine will also help to alleviate symptoms. "If you've been vaccinated, it'll run its course faster," Papastergiou said, adding that while more vulnerable patients can receive oral therapies for influenza by prescription, none of them are a replacement for getting a flu shot. Seniors who are on the lookout for a flu shot should know that although high-dose flu shots may be running low in some regions because they tend to go first, experts say getting a regular dose is better than holding out. "As a senior, I wouldn't pass on vaccination in order to look for a high-dose vaccine," he said. "Get vaccinated early with whatever's available."

The State Office for Health and Social Affairs (Lageso) reported a significant increase in reported cases of influenza and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) in its report on infections for the past week on Thursday. As expected for the time of year, the rising trend has continued, it said. The Berlin Corona situation report (as of 12 December) also shows a steeply rising curve of confirmed virus detections. RKI: Flu epidemic has not yet startedAccording to the Lageso report, the number of laboratory-confirmed flu cases in the capital has more than tripled compared to the previous week, but is still at a relatively low level of just over 120. According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the flu epidemic has not yet begun. In the case of RSV - a wave that is already underway according to the RKI - the Lageso reports an almost doubling of the number of cases compared to the previous week to 65. Children up to the age of two were mainly affected. Increased sickness rate at Charité and BVGMany staff are also absent at Charité University Hospital: "We are currently experiencing a further increase in sick leave among medical and nursing staff," a spokesperson said in response to an enquiry. Nevertheless, patient care is guaranteed, but in individual areas, postponed appointments or longer waiting times are to be expected. Patients were asked for their understanding. "We are also currently urging all visitors to wear a mask in the Charité clinics to avoid the possible spread of infection," it said. In Berlin, public transport companies (BVG) have also reported a significant increase in sickness rates.

Only 3.6% of Americans Got Updated COVID-19 Shots as of Oct. 31, 2023 Deadline Dec 12, 2023 12 min read COMMENTARY BY David Gortler Senior Research Fellow, Public Health Policy and Regulation David is a Senior Research Fellow of Public Health Policy and Regulation in the Center for Health and Welfare Policy. RN Patricia Cummings administers the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on December 29, 2020 in Washington, D.C. Samuel Corum / Getty Images Key Takeaways According to an October 24th Politico article only a mere 3.6 percent of Americans have gotten their updated shot. If people don’t seem interested in getting 2023 boosters, then why does the White House keep buying them? Americans are thoughtful people and don’t like secrets, bullies or mandates, especially when it comes to their own bodies. Copied Despite eschewing much of social media, television, and trendy media stories, I still couldn’t avoid major mainstream news reports in 2021 and 2022 covering entertainment news about gormless Hollywood/social media types and political officials (who increasingly seem to preen about like Hollywood entertainers) making embarrassing spectacles of themselves getting their mRNA shots and/or gushing online about it afterward with “vaxxies” (an amalgamation of words “vaccine” and “selfies”). Sometimes they even called for the press to witness them getting mRNA injections—and of course, the press always came. Are Americans Reticent to Get 2023 mRNA “Boosters”? If So, Why? Initial mRNA shots from Pfizer were granted emergency-use authorization by the FDA on December 11, 2020, and authorization of Moderna’s version quickly followed on December 18. Americans immediately and eagerly lined up for their shots, encouraged by politicians and celebrities. Unlike then, why aren’t we seeing pictures of people waiting in line for hours alongside pictures of celebrities gleefully posing in a sea of flashbulbs for fall 2023 mRNA shots? What is different this time around? Could it be that previous incentives, motivation, or clinical claims that existed then don’t exist now? Were those incentives and the subsequent enthusiasm contrived? Is it because earlier monovalent/bivalent COVID-19 shots did not live up to their promises? Not Just mRNA; Americans Don’t Seem to Want Any “Vaccines” in 2023. Why? According to an October 24th Politico article—almost two months after the 2023 updated COVID-19 boosters were authorized—only a mere 3.6 percent of Americans have gotten their updated shot. Only about 4.8 percent have gotten the influenza vaccine; so, it seems they just aren’t disinterested in COVID-19 mRNA shots. According to the CDC and FDA, flu vaccines are supposed to all be administered prior to Oct. 31. It is presumed that the fall deadline would be the same for COVID-19 shots as well, in sync with fall weather. After all, both influenza and COVID are respiratory diseases spread via airborne droplet transmission. Plus, with COVID’s high rate of mutation, mRNA shots would have to be given as quickly as possible, lest they become irrelevant to mutations. >>> Should Lipid Nanoparticles Used in mRNA COVID Injections Have Received More Vigilant Regulatory Scrutiny? How quickly? Researchers from the Universities of Bath and Edinburgh have published findings showing that COVID mutates as quickly as every two weeks. That is faster than influenza, potentially making COVID vaccines irrelevant faster than influenza vaccines, hence making the now expired Oct. 31st deadline critically important—not just for influenza—but for COVID as well. Despite those low numbers, the CDC called the ~3.6 percent COVID-19 compliance figure “on track” …which isn’t really accurate. And the flu vaccine’s 4.8 percent compliance rate a week ahead of an Oct. 31 deadline is not “on track” either. This is a noteworthy aberration from historical data illustrating around 50 percent of all Americans typically receive flu vaccines each year. Not to be outdone by consumer hesitancy, rather than making an effort to be transparent and put consumers’ minds at ease with an abundance of safety data, Pfizer is instead currently in late-stage testing of a combination influenza/COVID-19 mRNA injection after the FDA awarded it the highly coveted “fast track” review status in late 2022. Does that mean that in the future, consumers may not have the choice to just get an influenza vaccine without an mRNA COVID-19 shot? “On Track…?” October 24, 2023 headline from Politico. (note sub-headline as well)Who Makes the Recommendations and on What Scientific Bases? While the FDA evaluates the actual COVID-19 shot approval/authorization, the CDC sets recommendations of when and who should get them. Despite epidemiology stating otherwise, especially in kids, the CDC recommends that everyone six months and older receive an updated 2023 mRNA COVID-19 shot. Recommendations need justification. So where is the CDC’s big data set scientifically, immunologically, and epidemiologically justifying that everyone six months and older is what is most appropriate? Could that lack of evidence explain why not everyone seems to be taking their CDC marching instructions as before? Could it be that the CDC is losing its authority with Americans because they, too, have an abundance of unanswered questions over the mRNA technology and want more transparency from Big Pharma and the federal government? Despite Lack of 2023 Boosters, No Widespread Pandemic Appears to be Taking Place: Even prior to the release of newest COVID-19 shots on August 31st 2023, numbers were already fairly low. Despite the White House-predicted “seasonal surge” that doesn’t seem to be happening. CDC data tracker reports that only 9 percent of those tested are positive for COVID (and trending downwards) and only 1.2 percent of emergency department visits (and falling) are diagnosed with COVID. Hospitalizations are not surging with only 2.5 percent of deaths are due to COVID—but both hospitalization and death figures are non-specific as reported in this format. That’s because we don’t know age, non-COVID coadmission diagnoses, underlying comorbidities, dying “with COVID” versus “because of COVID” hospital-specific reporting/evaluation criteria, et cetera. Previous or current COVID shot(s) history is not provided but would also have been important to consider as well: Latest available CDC website data read “October 28, 2023” as of November 6, 2023. The regular updates specified in the image header are not taking place. Is the Lack of Celebrity Following Trickling Down to a Lack of Public Acceptance? Whatever the reason, enthusiasm for boosters seems much lower this time. Other than President Joe Biden, and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, few other politicians or celebrities are bloviating about getting new injections. Perhaps celebrities and politicians are all just quietly, privately, quietly getting them, but why are they subdued about it this time? It’s out of character for that attention-hungry demographic. If they are choosing not to get updated 2023 COVID shots, I’d like to know: Has something changed their minds? If so, what? Could it be at least in part because initial shots were authorized over a 9-month timeline when all other vaccines took around a decade? Or could it be that the shots have resulted in an abundance of reported safety concerns, in both the CDC’s V-safe database as well as in FDA’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which let the public report adverse effects after receiving a vaccine? Is There a Lack of Clarity on What Constitutes “Safe and Effective” to the Point That Even Liberal Hollywood Won’t Follow the White House? Investigational medicine scientists like myself have all heard officials state over and over again that “correlation is not causation.” But does that mean regulators and manufacturers should just continue to deliberately ignore more than 987,000 adverse event reports from COVID-19 shots in the US alone, especially when it has been shown that vaccine adverse event numbers are underreported by massive (over 95 percent) margins, according to a recent government-funded Harvard study? Maybe safety skepticism isn’t being brushed off by celebrities and politicians and their receptive followers. Of note, epidemiologists that the New York Times interviewed have already “fact-checked” and declared that “there isn’t much evidence proving that [celebrities] boost vaccine uptake [in their admirers]” but that’s likely debatable. After all, absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence—a phrase that the Times has quoted multiple times, along with government agencies, including the FDA. Plus, if “there isn’t much evidence” then why did the White House use its time and efforts to enlist an army of social media influencers to promote vaccines in 2021 and 2022? Why did Pfizer do the same? A list of examples may be found at the end of this article. With So Little Interest, Why is the White House Still Buying Tens of Millions of Injections and Tests? If people don’t seem interested in getting 2023 boosters, then why does the White House keep buying them? Interest in mRNA shots started waning back in 2022, forcing the government to waste 82 million vaccine doses when they expired in pharmacies. Back then, each dose cost between $25-$30, so somewhere between $2 and $2.5 billion was tossed out. On a side note, 2023 boosters are costing taxpayers three times what they cost in previous years, at $80-$85 per dose. Likewise, Paxlovid is more than doubling in price. Perhaps the price increase is just one manufacturer’s way of saying “thanks” to the American taxpayers and White House for funding their research via Operation Warp Speed, and the over 10 billion they received for Paxlovid and the tens of billions they have already received for mRNA shots. And there’s more waste: Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services has provided $600 million in taxpayer funding so that every American household can also request up to four COVID-19 tests, “for free” despite a lack of a widespread infection. It also ignores prior statements by the FDA stating that those tests can be inaccurate and are not adequately regulated. The White House isn’t listening to epidemiology or Americans’ disinterest and is proceeding full speed ahead by purchasing more shots and tests that are likely to go unused and expire or become unusable due to COVID-19 mutations. The remarkably low inoculation rate could be illustrative of the fact that Americans no longer trust federal or HHS officials’ recommendations for COVID-19 shots. >>> The Need for Uncensored Data and Debate on COVID Restrictions Even the Joint Commission which gives hospitals and other healthcare organizations accreditation has instructed its surveyors to stop evaluating healthcare workers’ compliance with COVID-19 vaccination. I’d love to know: what exactly guided their decision in 2023 versus that of 2021 and 2022? In summary, and to answer the initial question asked at the beginning of this piece: What has changed in fall 2023 from when mRNA shots were released around three years ago? Americans are thoughtful people and don’t like secrets, bullies or mandates, especially when it comes to their own bodies. Americans aren’t blindly taking orders by the federal government any longer. Even the Hollywood dreadfuls—the jackpot of liberal mentality—don’t seem to be following along anymore. If celebrities and politicians are getting boosted, why aren’t they going in front of the camera mugging, gloating, and grinning (behind their masks, of course) for the public to see this time around? The unusually low uptake of vaccines in 2023 also indicates that America’s public health agencies likely aren’t doing their jobs in several regards, namely in the form of transparently backing their public health decisions with cold, hard epidemiologic, pharmacologic safety and scientific justification. After all, wouldn’t Americans all rally around a transparently, legitimately proven safe and effective vaccine …maybe even taking pictures taken on their own volition, WITHOUT having to be pressured into doing so by a White House-hired legion of celebrities? Americans can read between the lines and are showing their distrust even if they aren’t outright saying it out loud. What additional proof do they need when even pliant, follow-the-leader celebrities and politicians seem to be ignoring CDC, FDA, and White House recommendations for influenza and COVID-19 “vaccines?” To that end, here is a list of just some examples of the absurd muggings by politicians and celebrities that were ubiquitous but have now gone from sight.

French researchers have found the answer. More precisely, they have understood the biological mechanism underlying the predisposition to severe viral conditions. “The French-American laboratory at Imagine Institute and Rockefeller University, coordinated by Professor Jean-Laurent Casanova and Dr. Laurent Abel, has long been interested in inter-individual clinical differences during infection, particularly with SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19),” the researchers explain. Ventilator Support Courtesy of Rcp Basheer Read Also: Blue Corneal Discoloration in a Six-Month-Old Following Antiviral Treatment for COVID-19 Severe viral infections: the role of type I interferons Their study, recently published in the journal Nature, looks specifically at the production of autoantibodies that neutralize type I interferons. Type I interferons are a group of proteins that are rapidly produced by the body’s cells in response to a viral infection and whose primary effect is to inhibit the replication of the virus in the infected cells. Autoantibodies (antibodies that attack a person’s own body tissues and cells) directed against type I IFNs have been identified in around 15% of patients suffering from critical forms of COVID-19, 5% of severe cases of influenza, and 40% of cases of West Nile virus encephalitis: “By neutralizing the action of type I IFNs, these autoantibodies prevent the body from defending itself against these viruses. It is likely that these autoantibodies are the cause of a large number of other viral diseases,” the report states. These autoantibodies are found in the general population (0.2 to 1 percent), with the frequency rising sharply from the age of 70, and are found in up to 5 to 10 percent of the elderly. This means that at least 100 million people worldwide are likely to carry autoantibodies that neutralize type I IFNs Certain rare genetic diseases can lead to the development of these autoantibodies. For example, they are present in all patients with hereditary autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type 1 (APS-1).

This was possible thanks to the identification of mutations in their genome that are responsible for a defective immune response. In the case of viral infections, the detection of autoantibodies that neutralize type I IFNs has important direct clinical implications for the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of patients,” the researchers conclude. “The observed increase in the presence of these autoantibodies after age 70 is another related issue, and understanding the underlying mechanisms will benefit from research into the genetic causes responsible for the development of these autoantibodies,” they conclude.
