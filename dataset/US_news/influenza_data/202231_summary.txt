- The 1918 influenza pandemic, known as the Spanish flu, was the deadliest pandemic in history.
- The virus spread rapidly and indiscriminately, infecting young, old, sick, and otherwise healthy individuals.
- Estimates suggest that the Spanish flu infected a third of the world's population and killed at least 50 million people.
- The outbreak began in 1918 during the final months of World War I, and the war may have contributed to the spread of the virus.
- Soldiers living in cramped and unsanitary conditions on the Western Front became ill and carried the virus back to their home countries when they went on leave.
- The virus was particularly severe among young adults between the ages of 20 and 30 who had previously been healthy.
- There is a theory that the virus may have originated in China and spread through the transportation of Chinese laborers across Canada in 1917 and 1918.
- Many of these laborers were already sick when they arrived in France to work on the Western Front.
- The virus caused massive illness and death worldwide and had a significant impact on global population and public health.
