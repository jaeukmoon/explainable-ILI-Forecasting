- The study analyzed the evolution of influenza A subtype H3N2 strains in Bangladesh over the past 10 years.
- The analysis revealed multiple clades of influenza strains circulating each season, often with substantial mismatches with WHO-recommended vaccine strains.
- The findings suggest that H3N2 strains are not specific to any geographical region and circulate globally.
- The study also found that influenza A subtype H3N2 strains from South and Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh, had the highest genetic proximity to strains circulating in the northern hemisphere.
- The stability of Bangladeshi strains indicates that they may be suitable candidate vaccine viruses for upcoming northern hemisphere seasons.
- The study suggests considering alternative strategies, such as mRNA-based vaccines, that use the most recent strains to improve vaccine effectiveness.
