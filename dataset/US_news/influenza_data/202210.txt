The prevention measures outlined in this guidance will help prevent transmission to health care personnel, other patients, and visitors. Patients who may be infected with novel influenza A viruses include confirmed cases, probable cases, and suspect cases/cases under investigation for infection with a novel influenza A virus associated with severe disease. Interim Guidance Background Current Situation Summary‎ For information on the most recent avian influenza developments specific to the United States, please visit the Current Situation Summary page. These recommendations will be updated as additional information on transmissibility, epidemiology, available treatment, or vaccine options for novel influenza A viruses becomes available. These interim recommendations are based upon current available information and assume the following: Lack of an available safe and effective vaccine against novel influenza A viruses associated with severe disease in infected humans [e.g., avian influenza A(H5) or A(H7) viruses] Concern for increased morbidity and mortality among infected patients Few or no confirmed cases in the United States This interim guidance recommends a level of infection prevention and control measures for patients with suspected or confirmed novel influenza A virus infection that is different from that recommended for patients with seasonal influenza, as outlined in the Prevention Strategies for Seasonal Influenza in Healthcare Settings. Among important differences from seasonal influenza guidance are recommendations for Contact and Airborne Precautions. Note that recommendations in this guidance are in addition to Standard Precautions. Information on Standard Precautions (can be found in the following documents: Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings Core Infection Prevention and Control Practices for Safe Healthcare Delivery in All Settings – Recommendations of the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee This interim guidance was developed based on existing infection prevention and control guidelines, currently available scientific evidence, and expert opinion. Definition of Healthcare Settings Definition of Healthcare Settings — Refers to places where healthcare is delivered. Healthcare settings include but are not limited to acute-care hospitals; long-term acute care facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities; physicians' offices; urgent-care centers; outpatient clinics; home healthcare (i.e., care provided at home by professional healthcare providers), and vehicles where healthcare is delivered (e.g., mobile clinics). They also include specific sites within non-healthcare settings where healthcare is routinely delivered (e.g., a medical clinic embedded within a workplace or school). Definition of Healthcare Personnel (HCP) Definition of Healthcare Personnel (HCP) – HCP refers to all paid and unpaid persons serving in healthcare settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials, including body substances (e.g., blood, tissue, and specific body fluids); contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment; contaminated environmental surfaces; or contaminated air. These HCP include, but are not limited to, emergency medical service personnel, nurses, nursing assistants, physicians, technicians, therapists, phlebotomists, pharmacists, students and trainees, contractual staff not employed by the healthcare facility, and persons not directly involved in patient care, but who could be exposed to infectious agents that can be transmitted in the healthcare setting (e.g., clerical, dietary, environmental services, laundry, security, engineering and facilities management, administrative, billing, and volunteer personnel). Information and Definitions of Facemask and Respirator available in the Appendix on this page. Fundamental Elements to Prevent Transmission Minimize Potential Exposures Implement policies and practices to minimize exposures before arrival, upon arrival, and throughout the duration of the affected patient's presence in the healthcare setting. Measures include prompt screening and triage of symptomatic patients, implementation of respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, placement of a facemask (Appendix) on symptomatic patients upon entry to the facility, placement in a single-patient airborne infection isolation room (or if unavailable, a single room with door closed pending transfer), and rapid implementation of Airborne and Contact Precautions with the use of eye protection, in additional to Standard Precautions. Use of source control for exposed but asymptomatic patients (e.g., household contacts) can also be considered. For more information on ways to minimize potential exposures: Prevention Strategies for Seasonal Influenza in Healthcare Settings. Implement Engineering Controls Consider designing and installing engineering controls to reduce or eliminate exposures by shielding HCP and other patients from infected individuals. Examples of engineering controls include installing physical barriers such as partitions in triage areas or curtains that are drawn between patients in shared areas. Engineering controls may also be important to reduce exposures related to specific procedures such as using closed suctioning systems for airways suction in intubated patients. Another important engineering control is ensuring that appropriate air-handling systems (with appropriate directionality, filtration, exchange rate, etc.) are installed and maintained in healthcare facilities. Monitor and Manage Ill and Exposed Healthcare Personnel` HCP who are potentially exposed to patients covered by this guidance should be advised to report any signs or symptoms of acute illness to their supervisor for a period of 10 days after the last known contact with the sick patient. Facilities should consider dedicating HCP caring for these patients to minimize risk of transmission and exposure to other patients and other HCP. Facilities should keep track of all HCP (e.g., clinicians, environmental services workers, food service) who care for or enter the rooms of these patients. HCP who develop any respiratory symptoms after any contact with patients covered by this guidance should not report for work. These HCP should notify occupational health services, their supervisor, or other appropriate individual about their symptoms, isolate themselves at home, implement respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette (e.g., wear a facemask), seek prompt medical evaluation, and comply with exclusion from work until they are no longer deemed infectious to others. If novel influenza virus A virus infection is suspected, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after symptom onset, especially for HCP with underlying medical conditions that may put them at increased risk for complications of influenza. For asymptomatic HCP who have been judged to have had an unprotected exposure (e.g., within 2 meters of a symptomatic patient with novel influenza A virus infection without use of recommended respiratory protection and eye protection), exclude the provider from work until 10 days after their last exposure to monitor for signs and symptoms of respiratory illness. If necessary to ensure adequate staffing of the facility, the asymptomatic healthcare worker could be considered for continuing work if they: Have a negative influenza molecular assay result on upper respiratory tract specimens. AND Are started on post-exposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis within 2 days of the exposure AND Wear a facemask for source control. The facemask should be worn at all times while in the healthcare facility during a probable incubation period, e.g., 10 days after the exposure unless in a situation where a higher-level of respiratory protection is indicated (e.g., entering the room of a patient on Airborne Precautions). Antiviral chemoprophylaxis should continue for the duration of the potential incubation period. Refer to the CDC web site for the most current recommendations on the use of antiviral agents for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza. Both HCP and patients should be reminded that persons treated with influenza antiviral medications continue to shed influenza virus while on treatment. Thus, hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette practices should continue while on treatment. Facilities and organizations providing healthcare should: Implement sick leave policies for HCP that are non-punitive, flexible and consistent with public health guidance (e.g., policies should allow and encourage HCP who may have infections due to agents covered by this guidance to stay home, unless hospital admission for isolation and treatment is recommended). Ensure that all HCP encompassed by these policies are aware of the sick leave policies. Provide employee health services consistent with those recommended in the Guideline for Infection Control in Healthcare Personnel and that: Establish procedures for tracking absences and promptly identify HCP who may have infections due to agents covered by this guidance. Ensure that HCP have ready access, including via telephone, to medical consultation and, if needed, prompt treatment. Train and Educate Healthcare Personnel Provide all HCP with job- or task-specific education and training on preventing transmission of infectious agents, including refresher training when an outbreak of respiratory disease is detected in the healthcare facility. Ensure Adherence to Infection Control Practices (i.e., Standard Precautions, plus Contact and Airborne Precautions) HCP (review section 7 for measures for non-HCP visitors) who enter the room or care area of patients covered by this guidance with suspected or laboratory-confirmed novel influenza A virus infection should adhere to all of the following (follow recommended sequence for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment): Hand Hygiene HCP should perform hand hygiene before and after all patient contact, contact with potentially infectious material, and before putting on and upon removal of personal protective equipment, including gloves. Alcohol-based hand rub is preferred for hand hygiene in healthcare settings; if hands are visibly soiled, use soap and water instead of alcohol-based hand rubs. Healthcare facilities should ensure that facilities and supplies for performing hand hygiene are readily available to all personnel. Gloves Put on clean, non-sterile gloves upon entry into the patient room or care area. Change the gloves if they become torn or heavily contaminated. Wear gloves whenever touching the patient’s intact skin or surfaces and articles in close proximity to the patient (e.g., medical equipment, bed rails, linens). Remove and discard gloves immediately upon leaving the patient room or care area. Please see section below on “Using More than one Kind of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)” for recommended sequence of PPE removal. Gowns Put on a clean gown upon entry into the patient room or area. Change the gown if it becomes soiled. Remove and discard the gown immediately upon leaving the patient room or care area. Respiratory Protection Use respiratory protection (i.e., a respirator) that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-approved disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator upon entry to the patient room or care area. See appendix for respirator definition. The respirator should be the last part of the personal protective equipment (PPE) ensemble to be removed. If reusable respirators are used, they must be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer’s reprocessing instructions prior to re-use. If disposable respirators are used, they should be removed and discarded after leaving the patient room or care area and closing the door. Respirator use should be in the context of a complete respiratory protection program in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation. (29 CFR 1910.134). Staff should be medically cleared, fit-tested if using respirators with tight-fitting facepieces (e.g., a NIOSH-approved disposable N95) and trained in the proper use of respirators, safe removal and disposal, and medical contraindications to respirator use. Eye Protection Put on eye protection (i.e., goggles or face shield) upon entry to the patient room or care area. Remove and discard eye protection immediately upon leaving the patient room or care area. If reusable eye protection is used, it must be cleaned and disinfected according to manufacturer’s reprocessing instructions prior to re-use. Patient Placement Place a patient who is confirmed or suspected to be infected with a novel influenza A virus associated with severe disease (e.g. probable or suspect case/case under investigation in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) that has been constructed in accordance with current guidelines. If an AIIR is not available, the patient should be transferred as soon as is feasible to a facility where an AIIR is available. Pending transfer, place a facemask on the patient and isolate him/her in an examination room with the door closed. The patient should not be placed in any room where room exhaust is recirculated without high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration. Once in an AIIR, the patient’s facemask may be removed; the facemask should remain on if the patient is not in an AIIR. Limit transport and movement of the patient outside of the AIIR to medically essential purposes. When outside of the AIIR, patients should wear a facemask for source control. Only essential personnel should enter the AIIR. Implement staffing policies to minimize the number of essential personnel who must enter the room. In the event in which large numbers of patients require AIIR, consideration can be made to placing patients who are presumed to have the same infection together (cohorting). Once the patient vacates a room, unprotected individuals, including HCP, should not be allowed in that room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. More information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available. In addition, the room should undergo appropriate cleaning and surface disinfection before unprotected individuals are allowed to reenter it. More information is available. Use Caution When Performing Aerosol-Generating Procedures (AGPs) Some procedures performed on patients covered in this guidance may be more likely to generate higher concentrations of infectious respiratory aerosols. These procedures potentially put HCP and others at an increased risk for influenza exposure. There is neither expert consensus, nor sufficient supporting data, to create a definitive and comprehensive list of AGPs for healthcare settings. Commonly performed medical procedures that are often considered AGPs, or that might create uncontrolled respiratory secretions, include: open suctioning of airways sputum induction cardiopulmonary resuscitation endotracheal intubation and extubation non-invasive ventilation (e.g., BiPAP, CPAP) bronchoscopy manual ventilation In general, these procedures should be limited to situations when they are medically necessary and cannot be postponed. When performing AGPs, limiting the number of HCP present during the procedure to only those essential for patient care and support is recommended. Based on limited available data, it is uncertain whether aerosols generated from some procedures may be infectious, such as: nebulizer administration* high flow O2 delivery *Aerosols generated by nebulizers are derived from medication in the nebulizer. It is uncertain whether potential associations between performing this common procedure and increased risk of infection might be due to aerosols generated by the procedure or due to increased contact between those administering the nebulized medication and infected patient Implement Environmental Infection Control Ensure that cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly. Detailed information on environmental infection control in healthcare settings can be found in CDC's Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities and Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings [section IV.F. Care of the environment]. Standard cleaning and disinfection procedures (e.g., using cleaners and water to preclean surfaces prior to applying disinfectants to frequently touched surfaces or objects for indicated contact times) are adequate for influenza virus environmental control in all settings within the healthcare facility, including those patient-care areas in which aerosol-generating procedures are performed. Management of laundry and food service utensils should also be performed in accordance with standard procedures. There are no data suggesting these items are associated with influenza virus transmission when these items are properly managed. Medical waste should be managed in accordance with requirements of the Department of Transportation. Some medical waste may be designated as regulated or biohazardous waste and require special handling and disposal methods approved by the State authorities. Manage Visitor Access and Movement Within the Facility Establish procedures for monitoring, managing, and training visitors Regardless of restriction policy, all visitors should follow respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette precautions listed in the Take Steps to Minimize Potential Exposures section of the Prevention Strategies for Seasonal Influenza in Healthcare Settings. For the safety of the visitor, in general, patients should be encouraged to limit in-person visitation while they are infectious. However, facilities should adhere to local, territorial, tribal, state, and federal regulations related to visitation. Encourage use of alternative mechanisms for patient and visitor interactions such as video-call applications on cell phones or tablets, when appropriate. For persons with acute respiratory symptoms, facilities should develop visitor restriction policies that consider location of patient being visited (e.g., oncology units) and circumstances, such as end-of-life situations, where exemptions to the restriction may be considered at the discretion of the facility. Visits to patients in isolation should be controlled to allow for: Screening visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness before entering the facility. Facilities should provide instruction, before visitors enter the patient’s room, on hand hygiene, limiting surfaces touched, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) according to current facility policy while in the patient’s room. Facilities should consider tracking (e.g., log book) all visitors who enter patient rooms. Visitors should not be present during aerosol-generating procedures. Visitors should be instructed to limit their movement within the facility. Exposed visitors should be advised to report any signs and symptoms of acute illness to their health care provider for a period of at least 10 days after the last known exposure to the sick patient. Monitor Severe Respiratory Infections in the Healthcare Setting Implement mechanisms and policies that promptly alert HCP about increased respiratory illness activity or outbreak within the facility. Establish procedures to identify HCP at highest risk and actively follow them for acute respiratory illness, and to encourage all HCP to self-report acute respiratory illness. Communicate and collaborate with public health authorities. Appendix: Additional Information about Influenza Information about Facemasks: FDA – Masks and N95 Respirators, FDA A facemask is a product that covers the wearer's nose and mouth. Facemasks are for use as source control and some may not be considered personal protective equipment. Facemasks may or may not meet any fluid barrier or filtration efficiency levels; therefore, they are not a substitute for N95 respirators or other filtering facepiece respirators, which provide respiratory protection to the wearer, or for surgical masks, which provide fluid barrier protection to the wearer. Information about Respirators: FDA – Surgical Masks and N95 Respirators, FDA A respirator is a personal protective device that is worn on the face, covers at least the nose and mouth, and is used to reduce the wearer's risk of inhaling hazardous airborne particles (including dust particles and infectious agents), gases, or vapors. Respirators are approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). A commonly used respirator is a disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator (commonly referred to as an N95). Surgical N95 respirators are NIOSH-approved disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators that also meet the FDA requirements for fluid penetration, flammability, and biocompatibility. Surgical N95 respirators are recommended for use by healthcare personnel who need protection from both airborne and fluid hazards, such as splashes or sprays. Reusable respirators include elastomeric half facepiece respirators and powered air-purifying respirators. To work properly, tight fitting respirators must be specially fitted for each person who wears one (this is called "fit-testing" and is usually done in a workplace where respirators are used).

The woman died on March 1, had underlying medical conditions and had not been vaccinated against the flu. She did not have COVID-19 at the time she died. “While this flu season is relatively mild compared to many previous years, influenza-related deaths have already doubled from last season,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “It is not too late to get a flu shot and protect yourself and your loved ones. The flu vaccine is safe and effective and is recommended for everyone six months and older.” The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending March 5, 2022: Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 2% of all visits (compared with 2% the previous week). Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 53 (compared to 29 the previous week). Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 1,657 (compared to 718 at the same time last season and a 9,809 prior 5-year average during the same week). Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 4 (compared to 2 at the same time last year). How to Prevent the Flu The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa. The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus. They include: People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control Pregnant women People aged 65 years and older People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego. In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick: Wash hands thoroughly and often; Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands; Stay away from sick people; Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; Clean commonly touched surfaces; and If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others. During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

Here we show that intranasal, but not parenteral, immunization with CTA1-3M2e-DD stimulated M2e-specific Th17 Trm cells, which conferred strong protection against influenza virus infection in the lung. These cells rapidly expanded upon infection and effectively restricted virus replication as determined by CD4 T cell depletion studies. Single-cell RNAseq transcriptomic and TCR VDJ-analysis of M2e-tetramer-sorted CD4 T cells on day 3 and 8 post infection revealed complete Th17-lineage dominance (no Th1 or Tregs) with extensive functional diversity and expression of gene markers signifying mature resident Trm cells (Cd69, Nfkbid, Brd2, FosB). Unexpectedly, the same TCR clonotype hosted cells with different Th17 subcluster functions (IL-17, IL-22), regulatory and cytotoxic cells, suggesting a tissue and context-dependent differentiation of reactivated Th17 Trm cells. A gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated up-regulation of regulatory genes (Lag3, Tigit, Ctla4, Pdcd1) in M2e-specific Trm cells on day 8, indicating a tissue damage preventing function. Thus, contrary to current thinking, lung M2e-specific Th17 Trm cells are sufficient for controlling infection and for protecting against tissue injury. These findings will have strong implications for vaccine development against respiratory virus infections and influenza virus infections, in particular.

Co-expression of Tbet or RORγt by Foxp3-regulated cells; IL10 production by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells; IFNγ production by Th17 cells; and IL13 production by Th1 cells, are other examples of functional plasticity.44,45,46 However, the mechanisms that drive this plasticity in antigen-committed CD4 T cells are still largely unknown, although they appear to be heavily context-dependent and may be ascribed to tissue-specific factors.47 In fact, little is known about the cues that promote Trm cell development following immunizations, let alone immunizations for long-term influenza-specific protection.48 Swain and co-workers identified a critical checkpoint at days 5-7 post-infection when effector CD4 T cells developed into Trm cells, which required IL-2 and cognate antigen-presentation.49,50 A critical question to answer is what the nature is of the Trm cell if it develops from effector cells and how can the Trm cell provide a progeny with necessary effector functions to combat infection and protect against tissue injury? For example, are Trm cells derived from Th1 effector cells, required for protection against influenza virus infection, or can these be derived from Th17 cells, especially in the light of unperturbed resistance against infection in Tbx21- deficient mice?20,51,52,53 Indeed, Th17-skewed memory CD4 T cells have been reported to exhibit a mix of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg-functions, even including cytotoxic features, in response to viral infection and inflammation.44,45 Thus, despite a growing appreciation of lung Trm cells for immune protection against influenza virus infection the signaling and transcriptional pathways that regulate the function of these cells during infection remain elusive.A vaccine targeting conserved viral proteins may be the key to developing cross-reactive, or “universal” protection against influenza.6 The ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) is a 24 amino acid peptide sequence that is highly conserved across influenza A virus subtypes.54,55 A wealth of studies document the capacity of M2e-based vaccines to confer protection in mouse models of infection, with phase I clinical studies confirming both safety and immunogenicity in humans.54 We have developed an intranasal vaccine candidate against influenza A virus infections and have provided strong evidence in support of its broadly protective ability in the mouse model.5 The CTA1-3M2e-DD fusion protein conferred protection via induction of both anti-M2e antibody and lung-resident M2e tetramer-specific CD4 T cells, which were predominantly Th17 cells.5 Significant protection was also observed in antibody-deficient mice following i.n immunizations, while loss of protection was found in IL-17-deficient mice, despite the presence of comparable anti-M2e IgG antibody titers as in wild-type (WT) Balb/c mice.5 Moreover, in the absence of M2e-specific CD4 T cells congenic H-2b restricted BALB.B mice were poorly protected, again while anti-M2e serum antibody titers were similar to those in well-protected Balb/c mice.5 In the present study we sought to capture the functions of lung M2e-specific Th17 Trm cells at the gene transcriptional level during the course of infection. We performed a temporal transcriptome and TCR VDJ-analysis of M2e-specific Trm cells isolated from the lung by FACS-sorting on day 3 and 8 post infection, in mice that had been immunized i.n 2 and 6 months earlier with CTA1-3M2e-DD.ResultsLung resident CD4 T cells are critically important for protection against influenza virus infection in M2e-immunized miceWe have previously shown that M2e-specific lung Trm cells were effectively generated through i.n immunizations with the CTA1-3M2e-DD fusion protein and strong protection against a lethal challenge infection with a heterosubtypic influenza virus strain was observed.5,11,56,57 Here we asked if the route of immunization influenced the level of protection and to what extent M2e-specific CD4 T cells were directly involved. We used Balb/c mice that were challenged 3 weeks after i.n immunizations with a 4xLD50-dose of the X47 virus strain (H3N2). Only i.n immunizations with CTA1-3M2e-DD resulted in significant survival rates and reduced morbidity, while subcutaneous (s.c) or intraperitoneal (i.p) immunizations failed to protect the animals, albeit comparable serum anti-M2e IgG antibody titers were detected in all groups (Fig. 1a). The better protection corresponded to a significant reduction in lung virus titres after i.n immunizations, which also was the only route to give M2e-tetramer specific CD4 T cells in the lungs (Fig. 1a, b). Noteworthy, the infection itself failed to induce detectable M2e-specific CD4 T cells in unimmunized control mice (Fig. 1b). Hence, the presence of M2e-specific lung CD4 T cells was a consequence of successful local i.n immunization, which was much superior to systemic immunizations (s.c, i.p or i.m), as we have also documented before.11Fig. 1: Intranasal immunizations with CTA1-3M2e-DD stimulate resident memory M2e-specific CD4 T cells and protection against infection in the lung.Female Balb/c mice, 6–8 weeks old, were immunized i.n., s.c., or i.p. with 5 µg of CTA1-3M2e-DD on days 0, 10, and 20 or given PBS alone i.n.at the indicated time points. After 3 weeks the mice were infected i.n with 4xLD50 of the influenza X47 virus strain and monitored for survival and loss of body weight for 14 days. a Survival and body weight in groups of mice (n = 10), with lung virus titres measured in duplicate at 4 days post infection (n = 3). Mice were euthanized if the weight loss ≥ 30%. IgG anti-M2e serum antibody titers were detected by ELISA and given as log10 titers ± SD in the different groups on day 0 of challenge. b Flow cytometric analysis of lung CD4 T cells for binding to the M2e-tetramer prior to and 4 days post infection (n = 3). Representative FACS plots (gated on 7AAD−, CD19−, F4/80−, CD8α− lymphocytes) show M2e-specific CD4+ T cells at indicated time points c Wild-type, IgA−/− (KO) or CD4 T cell-depleted WT mice, all on a Balb/c background, were immunized i.n and challenged by X47 virus as in A. Effective CD4 T cell depletion was achieved by i.p-injections of 400 µg anti-CD4 mAb (clone GK1.5) administered on 3 consecutive days prior to infection. Survival and body weight were monitored (n = 10), with lung virus titres measured in duplicate at 4 days post infection (n = 3). IgG anti-M2e serum antibody titers were detected by ELISA and given as log10 titers± SD in the different groups on day 0 of challenge. Results are given as mean values ± SD for each group. d One day prior to infection, 100 µg FTY720 or PBS was administered i.p. and then every 48 h during the experiment. Mice were euthanised if the weight loss ≥ 30%. Survival and body weights were monitored in the different groups (n = 10), with lung virus titres measured in duplicate 4 days post infection (n = 3). e Representative FACS plots (gated on 7AAD−, CD19−, F4/80−, CD8α− lymphocytes) show M2e-specific CD4+ T cells on day 14 in the lung of immunized mice with (blue) or w/o (green) FTY720 blockade (n = 3). f Lung M2e-specific CD4+ T cells in WT (green) or FTY720 treated (blue) mice on day 14 from i.n immunized mice labeled with anti−CD44, −CD62L and −CD69 Mabs and analyzed by FACS. The Log-rank test was applied for survival comparisons, one-way ANOVA test with Tukey’s correction for virus titers, log10 antibody titers, and comparisons of M2e-specific CD4 T cell frequencies by FACS. Significance was denoted by *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, or ****p ≤ 0.0001 and ns; not significant. These data show one representative experiment out of 3 independent experiments giving similar results.Full size imageWhile serum IgG anti-M2e antibody levels were shared by all immunized mice we investigated whether lack of local IgA antibodies could have accounted for the better protection found in i.n immunized mice. To this end we asked whether IgA-/- deficient mice were equally or less well protected compared to WT mice.58 We found that both strains were equally well protected following i.n immunizations and serum anti-M2e IgG titres were comparable in WT and IgA-/- mice (Fig. 1c). By contrast, when CD4 T cells were depleted from WT mice by administration of anti-CD4 mAb prior to the challenge infection we observed significant reduction in survival in immunized mice (Fig. 1c). This correlated with a reduced ability to control virus propagation (Fig. 1c). The M2e-peptide did not stimulate CD8 T cell responses and so depletion of CD8 T cells had no effect on protection or virus load in i.n immunized and challenged mice (Supplementary Fig. S1a-c).5,11,56,59 Taken together, lung CD4 T cells, but not mucosal IgA, was required for reducing virus replication, which was also associated with enhanced immune protection.Next we addressed whether lung resident CD4 T cells were sufficient for protection or if recruitment of CD4 T cells from the lymph nodes or spleen to the lung was required.15 FTY720-treatment was used to block egress of CD4 T cells from lymph nodes.60 To confirm that M2e-tetramer binding cells were lung resident CD4 T cells we injected labeled anti-CD45.1 Mabs i.v and found isolated cells to be negative, as also reported earlier (Supplementary Fig. S1d).5,61 Indeed, the FTY720-treatment had little effect on protection against a lethal challenge infection with X47 virus (Fig. 1d). Lung virus titres were essentially unchanged despite FTY720-treatment (Fig. 1d). Of note, protection was critically dependent on the M2e-peptide as no protection was observed in mice immunized with the CTA1-DD adjuvant vector alone (Fig. 2d).5 The distribution of M2e-specific T cells among all CD4 T cells in the lung post-infection was two-fold higher in FTY720-treated (22%) as compared to untreated i.n immunized mice (11%) (Fig. 1e). The great majority of M2e-specific CD4 T cells were CD44+ (90%) and CD69+ (80%) cells irrespective of FTY720-treatment (Fig. 1f). Thus, it appeared that M2e-specific lung Trm cells do not require support from lymph node or spleen M2e-specific effector memory CD4 T cells to convey strong protection.10Fig. 2: M2e-specific Th17 Trm cells in the lung demonstrate cytotoxicity and IL-17 production.Female Balb/c mice, 6-8 weeks old, were immunized i.n with 5 µg of CTA1-3M2e-DD or CTA1-DD on days 0, 10, and 20 or given PBS alone i.n. to generate lung resident M2e-specific Trm cells. The phenotype and function were determined in M2e-tetramer binding CD4 T cells isolated from the mediastinal lymph node (mLN) or the lung at 2 (a–c) or 6 months (d–f) after the priming immunization. Mice were treated with FTY720 after inoculation of live virus infection as described in Fig.1d, unless stated otherwise. The mice were infected i.n with a sublethal dose (a–c) or 4xLD50 (f) of the influenza X47 virus strain, as indicated. (a, b) Flow cytometry analysis of the distribution and absolute number of M2e-tetramer binding CD4 T cells among all CD4 T cells at 8 days in lungs and mLN following infection, or no infection, in mice i.n immunized 2 months earlier or unimmunized control mice. Assessments in (a) were also done in the absence of FTY720 blockade, as indicated. d In vitro cytotoxicity was determined in freshly isolated lung CD4 Trm cells from mice rested for 6 months following i.n immunizations and taken 4 days after infection with 4xLD50 influenza X47 virus. CD4 T cells were extracted by negative selection from pooled lung tissue and co-cultured at serial dilutions with a 1:1 mix of peptide-pulsed CFSElo (0.4 μM) and non-pulsed CFSEhi (1.0 μM) spleen-derived B cells for 6 h at 37 °C before analysis by FACS. e M2e-tetramer binding CD4 T cells were isolated from the lungs at 6 months after i.n immunizations and whole RNA-seq analysis was performed in pooled tissues (n = 2 × 3). The relative expression levels given as Log2-fold changes ± SD of specified sets of selected genes in M2e-specific Trm cells were compared to the levels of expression of these genes in naive splenic CD4 T cells (CD62Lhigh, CD44−, CD69−) is shown. Differential expression of selected genes associated with different functions; tissue residency, Th-lineage committment, and effector cytokine production are given as mean values ± SD. f Increased numbers of lung M2e-tetramer+ Trm cells following infection as determined by FACS on indicated days in mice i.n immunized 6 months prior to the experiment (left panel). Lungs were harvested and total mRNA extracted from whole tissues (n = 2) at indicated days following infection. An RNA-seq analysis was performed of differential expression of influenza X47 virus transcripts as indicated in lung tissue from unimmunized or i.n immunized mice at 6 months following i.n immunizations. Unimmuized mice were sacrificed or died due to infection before day 8. Mean values ± SD are given for each group and Log-rank test was applied for survival comparisons, one-way ANOVA test with Tukey’s correction for virus titre comparison, and unpaired, two-tailed t-test for FACS population comparisons. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001 or ns; not significant. These data show one representative experiment out of 2 (a–c, e, f) or 3 (d) independent experiments giving similar results.Full size imageLong-term protection correlates with the presence of Th17 Trm cells in the lungTo assess M2e-specific resident CD4 T cell memory (Trm) cells mice were rested for 2 or 6 months following the last day of i.n immunizations. We then challenged these mice by a sublethal dose of X47 virus to decipher which functional memory CD4 T cell subsets that expanded in the lung and in the mediastinal lymph nodes (mLN) in response to infection. FTY720 was used to block recruitment of memory CD4 T cells from lymph nodes and the spleen to the lung as before.53 The frequency of M2e+ Trm cells was significantly higher in the lung compared to memory CD4 T cells in mLN (Fig. 2a). Whereas FTY720-blockade did not affect the level of M2e+ CD4 T cells in the lung, it strongly increased M2e+ CD4 T cells in the mLN, as expected (Fig. 2a). Uninfected immunized mice exhibited very low levels of M2e-binding CD4 T cells in the lung and mLN after 2 months, attesting to the great potential of local expansion of these cells following infection (Fig. 2a). The vast majority of M2e+ memory CD4 T cells in lung and mLN were Th17 cells (Rorγt+) (65–80%) as determined by flow cytomtry. A reproducible fraction of the M2e+ CD4 T cells expressed the NKG2A-marker, associated with a cytotoxic function (7% NKG2A+) and more lung cells were CXCR6+ (>95%) than in mLN (70%), a marker previously found to correlate with Trm-mediated anti-infectious protection in the lung (Fig. 2b).62 When tested in antigen-recall responses in vitro the M2e+ memory CD4 T cells from lung and mLN exhibited a clear dominance of IL-17 spot forming cells (SFC), with low to undetectable levels of IFNγ SFCs found (Fig. 2c) Clear evidence of specific cytotoxicity was also observed in lung M2e+ Trm cells when incubated with M2e-labeled target B cells in vitro (Fig. 2d). Thus, following a challenge-infection in i.n CTA1-3M2e-DD immunized mice we found a dominant memory M2e-specific Th17 (Rorγt+) response in the lung and mLN that was associated with IL-17 and cytotoxic functions.A detailed characterization of gene expression in lung M2e-specific Trm cells at 6 months after i.n immunizations, prior to a challenge-infection, was performed. Following isolation of lung M2e+ Trm cells from pooled mice the results from whole RNA-Seq analysis was compared to a similar analysis obtained with naïve splenic CD4 T cells (CD62LhiCD44lo CD4+) (Fig. 2e). Fold-changes in gene expression were compared and as expected, the lung M2e-specific Trm cells exhibited higher levels of memory and tissue-residency genes, CD44, CD69, and Itgae (CD103), as well as increased chemokine receptor CXCR6 gene expression (Fig. 2e).62 A Th-lineage gene analysis revealed a strong presence of Th17-defining genes (Rorc and Rorα), while Th1 or Th2 master gene regulators (Tbx21 and GATA3) were not expressed (Fig. 2e).30 Moreover, lung M2e-specific Trm cells expressed distinctly higher levels of IL17a, IL17f, IL21 and IL22 cytokine genes, but also IL-4 and IL-10 gene expression were up-regulated, compared to that observed in naive CD4 T cells (Fig. 2e).63,64 There was also a higher expression of the Foxp3 gene, which could indicate the presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs), but which could also be consistent with Th17 cells.65 Also, in agreement with the NKG2A-flow cytometry finding, genes associated with cytotoxicity were up-regulated in M2e+ Trms (Fig. 2b, e).Following a challenge-infection with X47 virus we monitored the expansion of M2e+ Trm cells in the lung of FTY720-treated mice to get an estimate of the proliferative capacity of these cells in response to infection. We observed a 100-fold increase in lung M2e+ Trm cells over the 8–10 days of infection (Fig. 2f). This dramatic increase correlated closely with a reduction in virus propagation, as assessed by fold-change of influenza virus segment-specific transcripts in the lungs of immunized as compared to unimmunized control mice (Fig. 2f). This suggested a critical window for protection between days 2 and 4 of the infection in i.n immunized mice.Single-cell analysis reveals several subsets of M2e-specific Th17 Trm cells during infectionTo get a detailed understanding of the expansion and functional differentiation of the responding lung CD4 Trm cells following infection we performed single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNAseq) analysis of TCRβ+ M2e-tetramer-binding FACS-sorted cells on days 3 and 8 post-infection, correlating with protection and decreased viral load (day 3 effector phase), and increased survival (day 8 recovery phase), respectively. At each time point we sorted the M2e+ Trm cells to high purity (>95%) from 5 pooled mice that had been immunized 6 months earlier and analyzed their transcriptomes at the single-cell level using the 10X Chromium platform (Fig. 3a). After quality control, a total of 2013 cells from day 3 and 3262 cells from day 8 were used for downstream analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2a–c). First, we confirmed that all sequenced CD4 T cells expressed Cd3e, Cd3g, Thy1, and Cd4 genes, and that expression of the Cd8a and Cd8b genes was absent from our samples (Supplementary Fig. S2a). In total, 11 clusters were identified using Louvain algorithm (Fig. 3b, c, and Supplementary Fig. S2b). Differentially expressed genes (DEG) across clusters allowed us to identify major T cell subsets and based on Cd44, Sell, and Ccr7 gene expression we could distinguish a single cluster with naïve cells and 10 clusters hosting different memory CD4 T cell subsets (Fig. 3b–e, Supplementary Fig. S3, and Data S1). The most striking observation was that 4 clusters could be directly assigned to the Th17-lineage based on their higher expression of the Il17a, Rorc,Rorα, Tmem176a/b, and Ahr genes (Fig. 3b, c, e, Supplementary Fig. S4i–n).66 Of these an archetypical Th17 cluster (Th17) exhibited the highest expression of Serpinb1a, Znrf1, Il17re, and Ramp1, suggestive of a homeostatic expansion of these cells (Supplementary Fig. S3b, d).67 A second Th17 cluster (Th17/IL-22) expressed tissue repair genes Il22, Il17f, and Csf2 (GM-CSF) and was also high in IL-21 gene expression (Fig. 3b, e). Further, a third cluster (Th17/Tnf) expressed high levels of activation/inflammation genes such as Tnf, Nr4a1, and Nfkbid and hosting increased expression of Malt1, Maff, and Cxcr4 genes, similar to Th1 cells and possibly associated with a pro-inflammatory function (Fig. 3b, e, Supplementary Fig. S3a, d).68 Finally, we identified a Th17 cluster (Th17/Bcl2) that exhibited elevated expression of S-phase genes, Bcl2 and Lmna, and that was lower in expression of cytokine and activation genes, possibly potential memory cells (Fig. 3b, e). Less prominent clusters hosted cells with gene expression signatures typical for Tregs; Foxp3, Il2ra (CD25) and Itgae (CD103), Type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1); Il10, Lag3 and Tigit and Th1 cells; Ifng, Tbx21 (Tbet) and Icam1 (Fig. 3b, e, Supplementary Fig. S4c–e). Importantly, we found a single cluster hosting cytotoxic CD4 T cells (ThCTL) typified by Eomes, Gzma, and Ccl4 gene expression, and which also expressed several anti-viral encoding genes; Klrc1, Klrd1, Prf1, and Nkg7 (Fig. 3b, e, Supplementary Fig. S4f).Fig. 3: Single cell RNAseq transcriptomic analysis of M2e-tetramer binding Trm cells following infection.A schematic representation of the protocol and FACS gating strategy used for scRNAseq analysis of lung M2e-specific Trm cells from mice i.n immunized 6 months earlier with CTA1-3M2e-DD. a Samples were isolated from 5 pooled mice on day 3 or 8 post-inoculation with 4xLD50 of the influenza X47 virus strain. Cells were sorted by FACS and gated on M2e-tetramer+ and TCRβ+ cells and processed for 10X Chromium single cell library preparation. b Defining the cluster identity by dot plot representation of the expression levels of the top marker genes found in each cluster.

Finally, we identified a cluster that expressed the Ifih1, Cmpk2, and Daxx genes and which was also highly enriched for interferon-stimulated genes (Isg) (Ifit3, Rsad2,Gbp4, and Isg15), identified as the Isg cluster (Fig. 3b, e, Supplementary Figs. S3d, S4g). Both the Itgb1 and Isg clusters shared high expression of Tmem176a/b genes, linking these clusters to Th17-lineage cells, and suggesting that we, in fact, had identified a total of 6 Th17-lineage related clusters (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. S3d).69 Therefore, we concluded that at least 70–75% (day 3 plus 8 samples) of the M2e-binding CD4 T cells in the UMAP embedding appeared to be the progeny of activated lung Th17 Trm cells.Strikingly, samples taken from day 3 and 8 were represented in all clusters, albeit differentially distributed (Fig. 3d). However, noteworthy, the naïve, Th1, and Treg clusters were predominantly found in day 3 samples and were probably contaminating cells (Fig. 3d). Th17/Bcl2 (memory) and Th17/Tnf (pro-inflammatory) clusters, associated with early antiviral response, were observed in day 3 samples (Fig. 3d). By contrast, the Th17-, Th17/IL-22- as well as the Tr1-cluster were more strongly represented in day 8 samples, corresponding to the recovery phase of infection with more need for anti-inflammation and tissue repair (Fig. 3d). Indeed, the computed top DEG, typifying each cluster on day 3 in the effector phase of infection, hosted several interferon-induced anti-viral genes (Irf1, Irf7, Ifrd1, Socs1, Socs3, Ifit1, Bst2, and Isg15) as well as genes associated with mature resident Trm cells (Cd69, Nfkbid, Brd2, FosB) (Fig. 3b,e, Supplementary Fig. S5a and Data S2). From the early response of M2e-specific Trm cells to the recovery phase of infection on day 8 there was a shared increase in expression of adaptive anti-viral response genes (Nkg7, Ccl5, Ctsd, Ctsw) and lymphocyte activation and maturation-associated genes (Icos, Jak3, Id2, Ramp1, Maf, Lgals1, Lgals3) as well as genes linked to cell motility (Cxcr6, Ccr2, Itgb2, Lsp1, Glrx)(Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. S5b). The expression of regulatory genes (Lag3, Tigit, Ctla4, Pdcd1, Csf1) was also more evident on day 8 than day 3 samples (Supplementary Fig. S5b) Furthermore, IL-10 gene expression was observed in the Tr1-, Treg- and, less expected, in the CTL-clusters (Fig. 3e). Thus, the response to infection in lung M2e-specific Trm cells was strikingly enriched for Th17 cell functions and the transcriptome profiles indicated significant functional diversity, including cytotoxicity as well as immune regulation.Unexpected functional diversity at the TCR clonotype level of Th17 Trm cells in the lungNext we analyzed which TCR clonotypes that were represented in the responding M2e-specific Trm cells in immunized and challenged mice. The unique gene sequences of the TCRα and β chains were obtained from pooled mice on days 3 and 8 and projected onto the UMAP embedding (Figs. 3c, 4a).11 We observed that the naïve-, Treg-, and Th1- clusters were mostly made up of unexpanded clones corresponding to less than 3 cells, likely indicating contaminants or non-responsive clones (Fig. 4a,b). The diversity of TCR CDR3 motifs that could bind to the M2e-tetramer was clearly illustrated by the 15 most abundant combinations of TCRα and β chains that we observed (Fig. 4c). In most cases the defined amino acid CDR3-region of both α and β chains was restricted to one nucleotide sequence (Supplementary Figs. S6, S7). The most highly expanded TCR clonotypes were detected in the Th17, ThCTL, Itgb1 and Isg clusters (Fig. 4a, b). When the distribution of the top 20 most abundant TCR clonotypes with a unique CDR3-region were depicted in day 3 and 8 samples we found three on day 3, while a majority of significantly expanded clonotypes were observed in day 8 samples (Fig. 4d). Most importantly, we observed that the unique clonotypes were represented in several of the clusters, suggesting great functional diversity of Trm cells at the clonal level (Fig. 4d, e, Supplementary Fig. S7a, b). Thus, from the TCR clonotype analysis (VDJ-analysis) we could conclude that individual expanded clones were distributed to different functional clusters with, for example, the same clone hosting cells belonging to the Th17 - and Isg-clusters as well as the Tr1- and/or the ThCTL clusters (Fig. 4d, e, Supplementary Fig. S7a, b). Indeed, the relative distribution of ThCTL and/or Tr1 cells among Th17 clonotypes varied greatly from no to nearly 100%, suggesting that lung Trm cells could give rise to a highly varied progeny of functional subsets, perhaps depending on local conditions upon activation (Supplementary Fig. S7b).Fig. 4: TCR clonal analysis of VDJ gene sequences encoding M2e-specificity in lung Trm cells.Lung M2e-tetramer binding Trm cells from 5 mice were sampled on days 3 or 8 after X47 influenza virus inoculation, and sorted and pooled for 10X for scRNAseq analysis. a Distribution of significantly expanded TCR αβ clonotypes (clone size > 20 cells) as found in the UMAP cluster distribution of different M2e-binding Trm cells from Fig. 3c. b Cluster distribution of the M2e-binding TCR αβ clonotypes in different functional clusters from day 3 and 8, respectively. c Heatmap of the 15 most abundant TCR α and β CDR3-regions in expanded M2e-binding Trm cells. d Distribution of the 20 most frequent TCR αβ clonotypes in samples from day 3 or 8 post inoculation (left panel) and the distribution of these into the different functional cluster subsets (right 3 panels). e Examples of dominant M2e-specific TCR αβ clonotypes and their representation in the different functional CD4 T cell cluster subsets, according to the UMAP in Fig. 3c.Full size imageLung M2e-specific Th17 Trm cells become increasingly more regulatory in the recovery phase of infectionWe further characterized the functional diversity of the four highly abundant Il17a gene expressing clusters (Fig. 5a, b). These Th17-lineage related clusters shared expression of Il17a, Rorc, Rora, Lgals3, S100a4, Serpinb1a, Tmem176a/b, and furin genes, but were different in the expression of other genes (Fig. 3b, e, S3c, d, 5a–c, and Data S4). Indeed, in a majority of cases we observed M2e-specific TCR clonotypes that were present in all four Th17- clusters, as well as in the related Isg-, Itgb1- and Tr1 clusters, attesting to a high degree of functional diversity of lung M2e-specific Trm cells (Fig. 5c, d). However, with certain other clonotypes we found predominantly archetypical Th17 or ThCTL cells (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. S8). Thus, for example, the most frequent CAASMKDNYAQGLTF-CASWGGLGEQYF Trm clonotype was well represented in the four Th17-lineage clusters as well as in the Tr1, Itgb1, and Isg clusters, but no ThCTLs (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Figs. S7b, S8). On the other hand, the activated M2e-specific ThCTL CAVNNNRIFF_CASSENSGNTLYF clonotype also hosted progeny that expressed Th17-lineage genes (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). An extended analysis of DEG between the CAASMKDNYAQGLTF_CASWGGLGEQYF clonotype and other M2e-specific Trm cells in the respective clusters confirmed that these cells were primarily archetypical Th17 cells as few differences were recorded from the Th17 cluster (Fig. 5e). By inference, more differences were found when analyzing DEG for this clonotype within the Th17:Bcl2,:Tnf or:IL-22 clusters. Interestingly, within each cluster the TCR clonotype demonstrated a shift towards a regulatory profile expressing Lag3, Csf1, and Tigit (Fig. 5e). When comparing the eight most abundant TCR clonotypes across the four different Th17 clusters, we observed that the clonotype impacted greatly on the gene expression profile (Supplementary Fig. S8). Hence, a DEG analysis identified gene profiles that were different for different clonotypes within the same cluster. Finally, a Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the co-differentially expressed genes between day 3 and 8, using gene ontology (GO) biological processes, confirmed an up-regulation of regulatory genes, including Cxcr6, Rbpj, Fnbp1, Lrr58, Eif3f, Ctla4, Lag3, Tigit, Pdcd1, Tgfbr1, IL-10, and Smad3 genes, in the day 8 recovery phase samples (Fig. 5f, Supplementary Fig. S4d,n, S5b). Thus, the response to infection in the lung M2e-specific Trm cells showed a clear dominance of Th17-lineage related genes and the clonotypic analysis indicated major functional diversity, including cytotoxicity (ThCTL) and immune regulation (Tr1 cells) in activated and expanded lung Trm cells. Hence, it appears that Th17 Trm cells following i.n immunization with CTA1-3M2e-DD provide a broad range of effector and recovery phase functions, indicative of strong anti-viral control of infection concomitant with effective protection against lung tissue damage.Fig. 5: A detailed analysis of the expanded Th17 lineage M2e-specific Trm cells in response to infection.a The UMAP cluster visualization of Th17 Trm cells and cells exhibiting IL-17A gene expression. b Differentially regulated genes in the four Th17-lineage clusters compared to other M2e-specific Trm cells in non-Th17 clusters. c M2e-specific Trm cells in the four different Th17 subclusters also show differential gene expression profiles. d Some selected M2e-specific TCR clonotypes and their distribution into different functional clusters and the frequency that they represent in each cluster (circled). e Differential gene expression profiles when comparing the CAASMKDNYAQGLTF-CASWGGLGEQYF TCR clonotype with other M2e-specific Trm cells within each of the four Th17 cluster. f Bar plot showing the number of genes co-differentially expressed across all M2e-specific CD4 T cell clusters between days 3 and day 8 of infection (left) and their respective gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using gene ontology (GO) biological processes (right).

In agreement with other studies, we found that lung Trm cells were perfectly able to expand locally in response to infection without the need to recruit peripheral M2e-specific effector or central memory CD4 T cells, as assessed in our FTY720-treatment experiments.10,53 In the Tbx21-deficient mouse model anti-IL-17 mAb treatment failed to reduce the level of protection, hence, arguing for an important role of IFNγ.51 However, we did not find significant Tbx21 or Ifnγ gene expression in expanded M2e-specific Th17 Trm cells upon infection, (scRNAseq data). Neither did resting M2e-specific lung Trm cells after i.n immunization exhibit gene transcripts (Tbx21, IFNγ) consistent with Th1 cells. In addition, in vitro recall responses to M2e-peptide were completely dominated by IL-17 production in isolated lung Trm cells. Therefore, we have little reason to think that Th1 cells were involved in protection following i.n immunizations with CTA1-3M2e-DD.Our TCR-clonotypic analysis of M2e-tetramer binding Trm cells revealed that the expanded clonotypes in the lung harbored not only different functional types of Th17 cells, but also other subsets, such as ThCTL and Tr1 cells. These functional subsets likely contributed to protection and survival in the immunized mice because elimination of CD4 T cells prior to infection resulted in increased viral load and reduced survival. Given the many possible functions of Th17 Trms, documented by the scRNAseq data in the present study, we think complementing mechanisms of protection exist and that IL-17 is just one of several factors that are involved in anti-viral lung protection.5 The fact that CD4 T cells can acquire ThCTL functions, restricted by MHC class II-expression has been known for long.71 In the context of influenza virus infections CD4 T cells with ThCTL functions have been described in several studies.32,51,72 These cells were thought to be derived from Th1 effector cells. However, because our scRNAseq cluster analysis failed to detect expanding cells in the Th1 cluster and cells with a ThCTL gene expression profile shared unique clonotypes with Th17-lineage cells we propose that these cells may have emanated from Th17 Trm cells. To our knowledge this is the first study to indicate that Th17 Trm cells can develop into ThCTL cells. Noteworthy, these cells had a higher expression of the Tbx21 gene compared to cells in the Th17-lineage clusters, but significantly lower than unexpanded Th1 cells. Virus-specific ThCTLs have been ascribed a protective role because virus-infected epithelial cells express MHC class II molecules and could, thus, be eliminated by ThCTLs, although direct evidence for this in vivo is still missing.3,34,35,73,74 We demonstrated that CTA1-3M2e-DD immunized mice hosted CD4 T cells that were cytotoxic to B cells carrying M2e-peptide/MHC II complexes, providing in vitro evidence of a cytotoxic function in M2e-specific Trm cells. Thus, the ThCTLs could help in limiting viral propagation in the lungs as we observed between days 2-4 of infection.The scRNAseq analysis of M2e-tetramer binding Trm cells revealed a transition from an inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory function in the recovery phase (day 8) of infection, supported also by results from the GSEA. This way the effector stage of infection exhibited pro-inflammatory Th17 functions, while the recovery phase hosted regulatory Th17-cells that contributed to dampening inflammation (Th17) and promoting tissue repair (Th17/IL-22).75 Consistent with previous reports that Th17 lineage cells can acquire Tr1 functions we found that the recovery phase hosted archetypical Th17, Th17:IL-22 as well as Tr1 cells with gene expression signatures typical for an anti-inflammatory and immune regulating function.23,42 We think this functional breath of expanded lung Th17 Trm cells is important for preventing the extensive lung tissue damage that we have observed in unimmunized control mice following influenza virus infection.56 Th17 cells have been described to differentiate into pro-inflammatory as well as anti-inflammatory effector cells depending on the context of activation.23,41,76,77 For example, there is considerable knowledge from studying Th17 subsets in the gut intestine that attest to a dynamic functional differentiation of cells from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory functions.40,41,78 Although earlier studies have shown that Th17 responses could exacerbate lung pathology upon influenza virus infection,79 evidence from Tbx21-deficient mice, hosting lungs enriched for Th17 cells, exhibited reduced lung injury and less inflammation in response to infection.23,53The fate of lung CD4 Trm cells upon activation has been inadequately investigated.31,53 Current thinking advocates that activated Trm cells largely recall the function of the effector CD4 T cells in the priming immunization.53,72 Accordingly a successful influenza vaccine would be expected to generate a range of Trm cells of diverse functions.3,6,31 However, the results of the present study somewhat contradicts this notion as we observed that the progeny of the same lung TCR clonotype appeared in effector cells displaying gene expression profiles typifying Th17-, Tr1- as well as ThCTL functions in response to infection. Because a unique TCR clonotype is unlikely to arise from multiple precursors we can assume that the diversity of function that we observed within each M2e-specific Trm clonotype in the lung is a consequence of differentiation upon reactivation rather than subset-specialization following priming.80 This notion finds support in that Tr1 or ThCTLs frequencies among the expanded Trm clonotypes varied greatly between 0-100%, relative to the Th17 cell representation, which would be unlikely if the proportion of functional subsets were established already at the priming event (Supplementary Fig. S7). Therefore, we propose that effector cells arising from activation of lung Th17 Trm cells show functional diversity as a reflection of the conditions at the site of activation in the lung. We believe that local cues and the tissue-specific microenvironment can influence differentiation and the type of function required by activated Th17 Trm cells to control infection or prevent tissue damage.47 To ultimately answer the question whether differentiation diversity of responding lung Trm cells is the mechanism behind the multiple functional subsets observed within each clonotype or a function of predetermined subset distribution will require lineage-tracing experiments.81 However, to the best of our knowledge such experiments cannot be done at present as labeling of lung Trm cells prior to the challenge infection is not technically possible.Materials and methodsMice and immunizationsAge- and sex-matched BALB/c mice were obtained from Janvier Laboratories (France), while breeding of IgA−/− mice58 was done at the Laboratory for Experimental Biomedicine (EBM) (University of Gothenburg, Sweden) under specific pathogen-free conditions. Experiments were carried out at EBM and ethically approved by regional ethical committee. Three immunizations with 5 μg CTA1-3M2e-DD in sterile PBS via the i.n. (20 μL), i.p. (200 μL) or s.c. (200 μL) routes were done with 10 days between the doses.5 Control mice received 5 μg CTA1-DD i.n (20 μL) or PBS. Mice were rested 3 weeks or 2 or 6 months after the final i.n immunization on day 20 and sacrificed 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 14 days after an influenza A virus challenge infection, as indicated. Serum and lungs were extracted and collected. Serum preparations were stored at −20 ° C until further analysis. For CD4 or CD8 T cell-depletion experiments mice were given 400 µg anti-CD4 mAb (clone GK1.5, BioXCell BE0003-1) or anti-CD8α (clone 2.43 BioXcell) i.p. in 200 μL sterile PBS on 3 consecutive days. Depletion of lung CD4 or CD8 T cells was verified using FACS with a fluorochrome-conjugated, non-competing CD4 mAb (clone RMA-4) or CD8α mAb. To block lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphnodes and spleen mice were given 100 µg FTY720 (Cayman 10006292-50) i.p. in 200 μL sterile PBS every 48 h during the experiment. For testing of Trm status of the M2e-tetramer binding CD4 T cells in the lung, we used the protocol by Anderson et al using i.v injections at 5 min prior to sacrifice of 5 μg of fluorochrome-labeled anti-CD45.1 AF700 mAb (clone A20, BioLegend, #110724).61Fusion proteinThe CTA1-3M2e-DD or CTA1-DD fusion proteins were expressed in E.coli and purified by MIVAC Development AB, Sweden, as described in detail.59 The purified fusion proteins contained no endotoxin (<1EU/mg of protein), and they bound avidly to IgG in solid phase. The CTA1 moiety demonstrated enzymatic ADP-ribosyltransferase activity as determined by the NAD: agmatine assay.Influenza virus challengeInfluenza A virus challenge experiments were performed using a lethal dose of 4x LD50 of the mouse-adapted X47 (H3N2) virus strain (a reassortant between A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)) administrated i.n. to mice under light anesthesia. Weight loss and mortality was monitored on a daily basis for two weeks. According to the ethical permit, mice were sacrificed when a loss of body weight exceeded 30% of total body weight. Virus titers were determined by performing a plaque assay in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells at a density of 1.5 × 105 per well in 24-well trays (Szretter KJ Curr Protoc Microbiol. 2006 with modifications). Plaque forming units (PFU) were assessed on day 4 after virus inoculation. Briefly, the whole lungs were harvested and homogenized in gentle MACS M tubes containing 2 ml of serum-free DMEM media. The homogenates were then clarified by pelleting the debris and then stored at −80 °C prior to analysis. Upon analysis lung homogenates at 10-fold serial dilutions were incubated with monolayers of MDCK cells for 1 hour at 37 °C followed by washing and then PFUs were counted after an additional 4 days of incubation.ELISA and ELISPOTAnti-M2e antibodies were assessed in serum collected from individual mice at indicated time points. Antibody determinations were performed by ELISA using microtiter plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc) coated with 100 μl of 2.5 μg/ml M2e peptide in 50 mM PBS, pH 9.7 and incubated overnight at +4 °C. After blocking with PBS with 0.1% BSA, serial 1:3 dilutions of the samples were performed starting with 1/25–1/50 dilution. Bound antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies directed against mouse IgG, IgG1 or IgG2a diluted 1/1000 (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) and after incubation followed by nitrophenyl (NPP) phosphatase substrate (1 mg/ml, SIGMA) in ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm using a Multiscan MS spectrophotometer. The linear part of the curve was used for calculating titers at a cut-off level of 0.4 above background. Values are given as mean log10 titers ± SD. The ELISPOT assay was used to determine IL-17 or IFNγ producing cells from isolated mLN or lung lymphocytes. The dual kit for IL-17 and IFNγ spot forming cell (SFC) assessments was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Immuno Spot, CTL). Briefly, single-cell suspensions of mononuclear cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well, and 1 μM of peptide was added and the plates were incubated for 24 h (5% CO2, 37 °C). Cytokine ELISPOTs were evaluated using a CTL ImmunoSpot analyzer.Preparation of lung cellsSingle cell suspensions of lung lymphocytes were prepared with the lung dissociation kit from Miltenyi Biotec (ref 130-095-927). Briefly, the harvested lungs were first added into the gentleMACS C tubes containing enzyme mix and broken up into smaller pieces with gentle MAC OctoDissociator (lung 01 program). The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before the complete digestion on gentle MAC OctoDissociator (lung 02 program), after which, the cell suspensions were washed once with PBS, passed through a mesh and resuspended in appropriate media for further processing.FACS and cell sortingWe assessed the CD4+ T cell response after immunizations by flow cytometry using the PE-labeled M2e-tetramer, designed and produced by the NIH Tetramer Core Facility (Bethesda, USA) as described.82 Tetramer staining was performed at 37 °C for 30 min, with all other fluorochromes and dyes at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were analyzed using the BD LSR Fortessa X20 and sorted using BD FACSAria III or Aria Fusion (BD Biosciences, USA) using the 85 µm nozzle and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Single-cell sorting was performed on singlets, with 4-way purity at a maximum flow rate of 5000–10,000 cells/s. For analysis of expression of surface markers freshly isolated cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies as follows: To exclude dead cells, 7-Aminoactinomycin D (Sigma Aldrich) or Live/dead Aqua (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, Thermo Scientific) were used. Viable cells were blocked for non-specific staining with 2.4G2 (anti-Fc-receptor) and stained with the following antibodies; anti-CD4-BV785 (RMA4-5), anti-CD19-PECF594 (1D3), CD8-FITC (53-6.7), anti-CD62L-BV605 (MEL-14), anti-NKG2A/C/E-BV421(20d5), anti-CXCR6-BV421 (SA051D1), anti-Rorγt-PE-CF594b (Q31-378), anti-CD3-APC-Cy7 (17A2), anti-CD69-PECF594 (Q31-378), anti-CD44-AF700 (IM7) obtained from Biolegend, Biosciences or BD.Total RNAseq analysisM2e+TCRβ+ T cells were sorted from cell suspensions derived from 5 pooled mice after dissociation of the lung tissue using Lung Dissociation Kit (130-095-927, Miltenyi Biotec) at 6 months after i.n. immunizations and gene expression profiles were compared with those obtained from sorted naïve (CD44− and CD62L+) splenic CD4 T cells. The mRNA was extracted from M2e-tetramer binding and naïve CD4 T cells using µMACS RNA Isolation Kits (Miltenyi 130-090-276). cDNA libraries for RNASeq analyses were subsequently done with 200 ng RNA prepared using TruSeq Stranded RNA Preparation Kit with Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA removal kit to deplete abundant rRNA from purified total RNA. DNA probes bind to rRNA targets, which are both enzymatically-digested to produce total RNA free from abundant transcripts before proceeding with cDNA construction. A first-strand cDNA library was built using annealing purified total RNA and with random hexamers, in presence of First strand Act D Mix and Revers transcriptase which prime the sample for cDNA synthesis (25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 15 min, 70 °C for 15 min) and a second cDNA library following by Second Strand cDNA synthesis to generate blunt-ended, double-stranded cDNA fragments. dsDNA Adenylated in 3ʹ ends by adding an adenine (A) nucleotide to the 3ʹ ends of the blunt fragments to prevent them from ligating to each other. Subsequently an anchor ligated to double-stranded cDNA fragments to prepare them for dual indexing. Finally, magnetic beads were used to purify the adapter-ligated fragments for sequencing on an Illumina Nextseq 500 (High Output) to target a minimum of 15 million reads per sample. Whole lung tissue biopsies were prepared on different days following infection as indicated and submerged in 350 µl RLT buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The tissue was disrupted and homogenized and RNA extracted using RNeasy mini or micro kits (Qiagen), genomic DNA was eliminated using a DNase treatment step according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Single-cell RNA- seq and VDJ-seq analysisSample preparationSorted lung M2e-teramer+ TCRβ+ T cells (CD19−, CD8− F4/80−) from 5 mice at each time point were directly loaded onto a Chromium chip (10X Genomics) and run on the Chromium Controller for droplet generation. Reverse transcription was conducted in droplets and cDNA recovered through demulsification and bead purification. Pre-amplified cDNA further went through 10X library preparation for quantification of both mRNA and VDJ sequences {10.1038prot.2018.021} using 10X genomics v2 Chemistry kit.Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Nextseq500 (High Output) targeting a minimum depth of 10,000 reads per cell across all samples.Identification of cell typesBoth single cell RNA-seq and VDJ-seq Reads were pre-processed with 10X Cell Ranger software v.2 and further analyzed in R using mainly Seurat package {10.1038bt.4096}. Briefly, UMI counts were summed to the gene level for analysis. Genes detected in less than 3 cells were considered poorly expressed and removed from the analysis. The analysis was mainly focused on protein-coding genes. Cells with total UMI and gene counts above 3 standard deviations from the mean or with less than 200 genes were considered outliers and filtered out before further analysis. Effects from sequencing depth, gene counts, cell cycle, mitochondrial and ribosomal genes were regressed out. Since there were significant technical differences between the two samples, the datasets were integrated using the CCA method as implemented in Seurat.83 Integrated data was then processed for principal component analysis (PCA, 100 components), where uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)84 and the shared nearest neighbor (SNN, k = 10) graph were computed. Louvain clustering was performed on the SNN graph at varying resolutions. Differential gene expression was done using Wilcoxon test for each group, where genes with absolute log2 fold change above 0.1 and p-values below 0.05 were considered significant. Differentially expressed genes were further used for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)85 with the fgsea package {10.1101/060012} using gene ontology (GO) annotations. The comprehensive annotation of cytokines, transcription factors, receptors, and other genes related to the immune response were defined elsewhere {10.1126/sciimmunol.aal2192 }. Pre-filtered abundance tables from Cell Ranger were used for VDJ analysis. Since most cells have different amounts of predicted VDJ sequences, only the most abundant TCRα and TCRβ sequences found within each cell were assigned. For reproducibility purposes, all the analysis steps were done in controlled Conda environments86 via the Sauron pipeline (unpublished, https://github.com/NBISweden/sauron). All analysis steps performed in this manuscript from counts to the main figures can be recreated by following the instructions in the Supplementary Data. Filtering, clustering, and differential expression analysis were performed with Seurat (Satija Lab).In-vitro ThCTL assayBALB/c mice were immunized i.n. with 5 µg CTA1-3M2e-DD or PBS on days 0, 10, and 20. Mice were rested for 6 months before infection with 4xLD50 influenza X47 virus. Four days post-infection CD4 T cells were extracted by negative selection from pooled lung tissue and co-cultured at 106 cells and serial dilutions with a 1:1 mix of peptide-pulsed CFSElo (0.4 μM) and non-pulsed CFSEhi (1.0 μM) spleen-derived target B cells for 6 h at 37 °C before analysis by FACS. B cells were incubated in CFSE for 15 min at 37 °C before washing. CFSE+ B cells were pulsed with M2e-peptide (5 μg/mL, Innovagen AB) for 1 h at 37 °C.

In light of these most-recent avian flu outbreaks, it is necessary that members of the industry be proactive and keep up-to-date to ensure the health of their birds and safety of their poultry products. To help poultry growers and producers monitor these outbreaks of avian influenza, WATTPoultry.com has created an interactive map tracking cases confirmed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in North America in 2022, 2023 and 2024 in commercial poultry flocks: Clicking on each marker on the map displays key information for the bird flu incident with a link to learn even more about that specific case. You can filter the map view by a variety of criteria including date confirmed, flock size, type of operation and more. Information included in the map was provided by APHIS, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and state agriculture agencies where cases have been confirmed.The avian influenza map is updated as soon as possible once a new confirmed case is reported.The map only includes cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry. Detections of HPAI in wild birds or backyard flocks will not be included in this map, as such cases, in accordance with OIE standards, should not result in any trade restrictions.RecommendedLatest NewsUSPOULTRY holds seminarIndustry OrganizationsVirginia Egg Council’s Cecelia Glembocki to retireRelated StoriesEggPhilippines, Thailand step up biosecurity against HPAIEggMaryland layer flock hit by avian influenzaEggAvian flu now confirmed in all North American flywaysCage-Free Laying SystemsCP Foods aims to raise 2022 cage-free production by 25%More in EggIndustry OrganizationsVirginia Egg Council’s Cecelia Glembocki to retireBrand InsightsVaccination success depends on crew trainingZoetisContinuous evaluation and training are critical to improving pullet vaccination accuracy.Animal WelfareNoble Foods, actor Kelvin Fletcher partner on hen welfareStructures for climbing and tires filled with dust are just a couple of the enrichment materials the egg producer provides its birds.Business and MarketsVital Farms reports over 30% net revenue boost in 2024New offerings, retail distribution gains are given as some of the reasons sales grew in the most recent quarter.Egg ProcessingWhy the egg sector should look more to pet careThere are numerous reasons why egg producers ought to more fully embrace pet nutrition and care.EggUK egg producer Farmlay invests in new grading capacityState-of-the-art egg grader, to be installed in January 2025, responds to growing consumer demand for eggs and more favorable investment climate.EggMichael Foods boosts efficiency at new Minnesota feed millLeading egg producer replaced two aging feed mills with a single, fully automated one, ushering in a new era for Gaylord feed operation.Hen Housing SystemsHow Burnbrae Farms aims to overcome activist challengesBurnbrae Farms CEO Margaret Hudson explains how the company is dealing with an active campaign from an animal activist group.Latest NewsKathy Brodhagen is new CEO at Echo Lake FoodsShe brings to the company years of experience in the egg products industry.EggHappy Egg completes merger with Egg InnovationsThe merger brings together two of the largest U.S. based free-range and pasture-raised egg companies.EuropeMoldovan farm authorized to export eggs to EUGeorge Standard has invested in improvements to production methods and raised product standards to meet the EU standards.EggBurcon launches Puratein for egg replacement applicationsEgg ProductionCooper Farms increases liquid egg productionNew silos will increase storage capacity by 50%.Page 1 of 484Next PageNews and analysis for the global poultry industryFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconDelete My DataTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMoreWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsMedia RequestPrivacy PolicySite Map© 2024 All rights reserved.What happened when the 1918 flu pandemic met WWI | PBS News Full Episode Sunday, Nov 10 Close Menu PBS NewsHour Episodes Podcasts Newsletters The Latest Politics Brooks and Capehart Politics Monday Supreme Court Arts CANVAS Poetry Now Read This Nation Supreme Court Race Matters Essays Brief But Spectacular World Agents for Change Economy Making Sen$e Paul Solman Science The Leading Edge ScienceScope Basic Research Innovation and Invention Health Long-Term Care Education Teachers' Lounge Student Reporting Labs For Teachers Newshour Classroom NewsHour Shop About Feedback Funders Support Jobs Close Menu Give to PBS News Hour now while all gifts are MATCHED!

Before Russia’s forces began attacking its neighbor, both countries had just hit records in new daily cases, peaking at an all-time high in Ukraine in early February. On Feb. 24, the day Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the assault, there were more than 25,000 new confirmed cases in Ukraine, according to the World Health Organization. While infections had begun to fall before Russia’s invasion, for multiple days in the past week the global health agency had reported no official data from the country – perhaps a reflection of the chaos and violence that has sent more than 2 million refugees to flee to other countries and scrambled its health infrastructure. No one has any real idea of how the virus may be spreading now. WATCH: Russian shelling of civilian targets causes day of carnage across Ukraine “Low rates of testing since the start of the conflict mean there is likely to be significant undetected transmission,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a news briefing on March 2. “Coupled with low vaccination coverage, this increases the risk of large numbers of people developing severe disease.” Just 35 percent of Ukrainians are fully vaccinated against COVID, while 50 percent of Russians are – both below the worldwide average. On every level, it is unwise to declare war during a pandemic. On every level, it is unwise to declare war during a pandemic. Infectious diseases have typically followed lines of humans engaged in travel, commerce and war. From the Civil War up until World War II, more soldiers died of infections than from bullets. Cholera, typhus fever, bubonic plague and other deadly microbes were all spread because germs also travel. This was certainly the case with the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919, which was one of the worst contagion crises in the history of humankind. Around the world, anywhere from 40 to 100 million people died, according to various estimates, with 500,000 to 750,000 deaths in the United States alone. It was a particularly virulent and novel strain of influenza that attacked young adults most severely, in contrast to seasonal influenza’s typical victims, the very young and the elderly.

In the months leading up, more than 4 million young men were sent to U.S. Army camps all over the country, traveling by train, cheek by jowl. They arrived to discover far-less-than-deluxe accommodations of crowded tents, dormitories, sloppy mess halls and poorly dug latrines. And when they were ready to ship out, they traveled—again by crowded trains—to the Atlantic seaboard where they boarded crowded troop ships taking them to the European theater, where many million more were already fighting. En route, many became seasick and vomited profusely; all of them slept in ridiculously close quarters, with the bunks resembling bookshelves stuffed with human cargo. Their destination was often the grimiest, filthiest trenches ever dug. To say troop conditions were not exactly sanitary is a gross understatement. Many of these young men were not only victims of influenza but terrific vectors for spreading microbes to others. READ MORE: The ‘awful’ work of the real doctors who inspired M*A*S*H There were three waves across the 1918-1919 pandemic, and another in the winter of 1920. During the second wave, which lasted from September to December of 1918, soldiers, sailors and even ambulance drivers were among the hardest hit groups on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In recent years, some have claimed to pinpoint the outbreak’s origin to this Army camp in Kansas or that foxhole in Marne, but such microbe-gazing is a parlor game and impossible to prove. When discussing the coronavirus in 2022, however, origin stories no longer matter nearly as much as asking where the virus is spreading now and how it continues to make millions of people ill, or worse. Unlike our current era, nobody knew much about virology at all back in 1918, and didn’t know exactly what caused the flu. Scientists had a better hand on bacteriology, but many experts incorrectly thought influenza was caused by the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae (hence, the quaint Latin last name). They had no medications yet that would work against bacteria – no antibiotics, let alone antivirals that could have helped in the pandemic. There were no intravenous fluids, respirators or intensive care units; nurses and doctors were in short supply; and medical care was more a form of warehousing these young men and women than what we would expect today. Working at these overcrowded base hospitals, let alone finding yourself in one, was a nightmare. The ill soldiers were “placed on cots until every bed is full and yet others crowd in.” Modern medical knowledge has greatly advanced, but the conditions on the ground are still dire. The United Nations has warned that Ukraine’s health care system is in grave danger. “As increasing numbers of people are displaced, the increased risk of COVID-19 contagion, combined with growing numbers of injured people in need of emergency medical services, will put additional pressure on the country’s already-stretched health system,” the U.N. humanitarian agency wrote in a Feb. 26 report. On Wednesday, Ukrainian officials reported that Russia had bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol, killing three and wounding more than a dozen people, including women waiting to give birth. Russia has attacked at least 18 medical facilities in two weeks, according to WHO. During WWI, most of the soldiers who died from the pandemic did not just die of influenza but of secondary bacterial pneumonia. As these poor souls’ lungs filled up with fluid, immune cells, and bacterial detritus, they turned blue from the lack of oxygen, often bled from the nose and mouth and ultimately suffocated.

Photo by JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP via Getty Images The ill soldiers were “placed on cots until every bed is full and yet others crowd in. The faces soon wear a bluish cast; a distressing cough brings up the blood-stained sputum. In the morning the dead bodies are stacked about the morgue like cord wood,” recalled a doctor named Victor C. Vaughan. Years after witnessing influenza among “the stalwart young men” under his care at Camp Devens, Vaughan graphically recalled the carnage in his 1926 autobiography, “A Doctor’s Memories.” Then the dean of the University of Michigan Medical School, Vaughan knew what he was talking about when it came to epidemics and combat. He had toured Army hospitals in 1898 during the Spanish American War and even contracted the dreaded yellow fever while doing so. READ MORE: How smallpox devastated the Aztecs – and helped Spain conquer an American civilization 500 years ago But Vaughan never forgot the horror he experienced in 1918 as a helpless doctor with nothing in his black bag, save morphine, to alleviate suffering. “This picture was painted on my memory cells,” he later wrote, “the deadly influenza virus [that] demonstrated the inferiority of human inventions in the destruction of human life… This infection. like war, kills the young, vigorous, robust adults …The husky male either made a speedy and rather abrupt recovery or was likely to die.” A weakened or ill fighting force does not help anyone’s cause. When mated with 21st century technology, the incursion could spread infection from COVID far more quickly than tanks can travel, not only among soldiers but also among the civilians victimized by war.

Back to Healio Interim estimates published Thursday in MMWR indicate that this season’s influenza vaccine has not been effective. Based on data from more than 3,600 children and adults, CDC epidemiologist Jessie R. Chung, MPH, and colleagues estimated that the vaccine has been 16% effective against mild or moderate influenza caused by the predominant circulating virus, influenza A(H3N2), with a 95% confidence interval (–16% to 39%) that suggests vaccination “did not significantly reduce the risk of outpatient medically attended illness” caused by H3N2. Chung JR, et al. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2022;doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm7110a1. Studies to determine the how well the vaccine has prevented more severe outcomes are ongoing, Chung and colleagues said. It was the first time the CDC has been able to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness since 2019-2020. Unusually low influenza activity last season — a result of measures taken to fight COVID-19 — meant there were not enough available data to make an estimate. Influenza activity this season has also been relatively low. It peaked during the last week of 2021 and has remained below the national baseline for the last 5 weeks, according to the CDC’s FluView. The new report included data from 3,636 children and adults with acute respiratory infections who were enrolled at seven sites in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network. Chung and colleagues said “enrollment was insufficient to generate reliable” estimates of vaccine effectiveness by age group or type of vaccine, but noted that the overall estimate was “consistent” with estimates from previous seasons dominated by H3N2 viruses, which are known to evade vaccines and cause relatively severe illness. They noted that vaccine coverage has been lower this season in some high-risk groups, including pregnant women, infants and preschool-aged children, but also that the rates of influenza-related hospitalizations have been “substantially lower” than in other H3N2-predominant seasons. Among the participants in the study, 194 (5%) received a positive test for an influenza A virus and none for an influenza B virus. Among the 178 influenza A viruses that were subtyped, only one came back as H1N1. The other 177 were H3N2. Eleven people in the study tested positive for both influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The percentage of patients with an acute respiratory infection who received an influenza vaccine ranged from 31% to 64%. Among participants with a positive influenza test, 41% were vaccinated compared with 50% of those who tested negative. Chung and colleagues said the estimates “underscore the need for ongoing diagnostic testing for influenza, influenza antiviral treatment and prophylaxis when indicated, and everyday preventive measures” and that the CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccines even when they are less effective “because a growing body of evidence suggests that influenza vaccination can avert serious outcomes, including hospitalization, ICU admission, and death, among persons who are vaccinated but still become infected.” “In addition, vaccination is likely to prevent illness or serious complications of infection with other influenza viruses that might circulate later in the season, including influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses,” they wrote. [Editor’s note: This story was updated to include information about the vaccine’s effectiveness against more severe outcomes and to better characterize the level of influenza this season.] Published by: Sources/DisclosuresCollapse Source: Chung JR, et al.

WVXU has covered the pandemic's impact on the Tri-State from the very beginning, when on March 3, 2020, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine barred spectators from attending the Arnold Sports Festival in Columbus over concerns about the virus, even though Ohio had yet to confirm a single case of COVID-19. Recounting the similarities between the 1918 influenza pandemic and coronavirus 91.7 WVXU | By Bill Rinehart Published March 8, 2022 at 4:47 AM EST Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Listen • 4:21 Edward A. "Doc" Rogers / Library of Congress/APThis combination photo shows volunteer nurses from the American Red Cross tending to influenza patients in the Oakland Municipal Auditorium, used as a temporary hospital in 1918, left, and COVID-19 patients on beds at a field hospital built inside a sports coliseum in Santo Andre, outside Sao Paulo, Brazil, on March 4, 2021. COVID-19 first entered the public consciousness about two years ago. It drew a lot of comparisons to another pandemic just over a hundred years earlier. WVXU's Bill Rinehart looks at the influenza wave that surfaced in 1918 and what lessons it has for us today. It's commonly referred to as the Spanish Flu, but that's a misnomer, as there's no consensus it started in Spain. If you call it the 1918 Influenza pandemic, that's not quite accurate either. The CDC says flu season in the United States typically ramps up in October and peaks between December and February. Dr. Carl Fichtenbaum says that pandemic wasn't like that."It lasted far more than a flu season. It lasted for a couple of years around the world," he says. "There were different waves at different times in different countries." Library of Congress St. Louis Red Cross Motor Corps on duty in Oct. 1918 during the influenza epidemic. Fichtenbaum is a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Cincinnati. He says records from several countries show three waves of flu."Most likely it did exactly what the coronavirus is doing now, which is that there were changes, there were mutations. There were variants."Fichtenbaum says the records of the period aren't good enough to demonstrate how the virus changed from wave to wave. He says medicine looked a lot different then."There were no vaccines," he says. "There was no specific treatment. There was actually very little in the way of oxygen that was really available for the treatment. There were no intensive care units." Library of Congress The Library of Congress has for the caption of this photo, "Her sister had not seen Mrs. Brown for almost a week, and with Mr. Brown a soldier in France, she became so worried she telephoned Red Cross Home Service which arrived just in time to rescue Mrs. Brown from the clutches of influenza." There are some similarities between the influenza and coronavirus pandemics. Fichtenbaum says the human response to the 1918 illness is very familiar."Some physicians recognized that this was probably a respiratory illness and that people should be wearing masks. Other people objected to the idea of wearing masks. What a strange phenomena," he says. "And there were people who said you should be separated out if you're sick. Let's put all the sick people together and keep them away from the healthy people." Library of Congress Precautions taken in Seattle, Wash., during the 1918 influenza epidemic would not permit anyone to ride on the streetcars without wearing a mask. In three days, 260,000 of these were made by the Seattle Chapter of the Red Cross, which consisted of 120 workers. The flu stuck around, by some accounts until 1920. Some historians point to a fourth wave that hit a few scattered American cities, and assorted nations. After that, the virus petered out."There were no longer big spikes, because probably most people had been infected by then and had developed a measure of immunity so it wasn't spreading quite as much," Fichtenbaum says. "And it wasn't spreading at times when we wouldn't expect influenza to spread."Fichtenbaum says the pandemic ended not because of a vaccine. There wasn't one. It wasn't masking, or isolation that stopped it either. He says it ended because of herd immunity. But that immunity came at a cost. There were an estimated 675,000 deaths in the United States, and at least 50 million deaths worldwide.Both pandemics revealed some things about usThe pandemic transformed the world in a lot of ways. Fichtenbaum says it led to more medical research and better ideas about public health. He says those are the most important lessons."Unfortunately most humans have a very short memory. And we do not learn very well from history. We are very suspect," he says. "There's this kind of feeling that 'Well, you need to really prove to me that this works.' " Library of Congress A nurse takes a patient's pulse in the influenza ward at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C. Fichtenbaum says both pandemics, influenza and the coronavirus, revealed a number of flaws in society: a lack of critical thinking skills, along with poor messaging, conflicting recommendations, and bad decisions from public health officials, politicians and military leaders."When you are not an open-minded, critical thinker willing to look at history, you are destined to make the same mistakes that were made at the time of a previous pandemic, because all emergency situations threaten people in such a way that makes it hard to make decisions."Fichtenbaum says had more people learned from history, there would have been fewer deaths from COVID-19.This story is part of a series as WVXU looks at the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects its had on our world.

Cases are rising as we are now in peak migration season. Millions of snow geese stop at wildlife preserves, such as DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, near Missouri Valley, Iowa. (DTN photo by Elaine Shein) OMAHA (DTN) -- The number of states impacted by highly pathogenic avian influenza continues ticking upward as USDA has reported at least three more commercial flocks have been infected. The growing number of cases comes as the spring migratory season is peaking in major flyways along rivers such as the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Millions of geese and other migratory birds are moving through the region. Wild birds often carry HPAI but do not show symptoms. Domestic backyard and commercial flocks of chicken and turkeys are more susceptible to the bird flu carried in by those migratory birds. As cases have cropped up, the European Union has banned imports of eggs for a ten-kilometer (6.2 miles) radius around each infected farm, though there have been no links to HPAI and the food supply. Japan, South Korea and other countries have also continued to place import restrictions on eggs or other poultry products after HPAI confirmations. USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service on Sunday confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a commercial mixed-species flock in Charles Mix County, South Dakota, which is along the Missouri River in southeast South Dakota. Also on Monday, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced a commercial turkey flock in Buena Vista County, Iowa, had a confirmed positive case of HPAI. Last week, Iowa had its first cases of bird flu confirmed in a backyard flock. Officials did not immediately release the number of turkeys involved on this latest farm. On Saturday, APHIS reported a commercial egg-laying chicken farm was confirmed with HPAI in Cecil County, Maryland, which is part of the Delmarva poultry production area. USDA did not immediately release how many birds were involved in the flock. Press staff for APHIS did not respond during the weekend to questions about the flock sizes for the Maryland or South Dakota operations. The agency's website listing those details was not updated. P[L1] D[0x0] M[300x250] OOP[F] ADUNIT[] T[] More Recommended for You Recommended for You USDA on Friday confirmed HPAI in a flock of 240,000 broiler chickens in Stoddard County, Missouri, in the southeast corner of the state. As protocol, the farm was quarantined, and the birds will be depopulated on the premise. None of the birds will enter the food chain. "The Missouri Department of Agriculture is working closely with federal animal health officials to contain and eliminate the disease," Director of Agriculture Chris Chinn said. "Protecting the health and welfare of livestock and poultry is a top priority. We encourage both commercial and backyard poultry producers to tighten their biosecurity protocols to help stop the spread of the virus." USDA has reported cases in domestic flocks in 12 states. By earliest date confirmed, those include Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia, New York, Maine, Delaware, Michigan, Connecticut, Iowa, Missouri, Maryland and South Dakota. The new confirmed cases mean USDA, state officials and farmers have had to depopulate at least nearly 1.9 million chickens and turkeys since early February when the first cases were reported. Nebraska and Kansas departments of agriculture also each sent out alerts to their farmers cautioning about the importance of biosecurity measures "While we have not seen HPAI in Nebraska since 2015, protecting the health of poultry in the state is a top priority," said Nebraska State Veterinarian Roger Dudley. "It's important for poultry owners to know about this disease, take the necessary steps to help prevent its spread, and protect Nebraska's poultry industry." The Kansas Department of Agriculture's Division of Animal Health encouraged poultry owners, with both commercial and backyard flocks, to take steps to protect their flocks from avian influenza by monitoring their birds for symptoms and by implementing biosecurity practices. "Protecting the poultry in the state is a high priority, and we need all poultry owners to be part of the effort to prevent the spread of disease in Kansas," said Kansas Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith. "Our best defense is to follow strict biosecurity practices and vigilantly monitor birds for any signs of illness." HPAI is an airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among chickens and turkeys through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. Avian influenzas are classified as either low or high pathogenic based on the ability of a particular strain to produce the disease in domestic poultry. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. Wild birds often do not show signs of illness, but HPAI can be fatal to domestic birds. The growing number of cases raises concerns that the poultry industry could experience an outbreak comparable to 2015, which USDA considers as the largest and most expensive animal-disease outbreak in U.S. history. In that outbreak, 43 million chickens had to be depopulated, including 33 million in Iowa alone. Another 7.4 million turkeys had to be depopulated as well. USDA spent nearly $1 billion for depopulation, disposal and producer indemnity payments in 2015. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections in birds do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. It remains safe to eat poultry products. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 F kills bacteria and viruses. Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/… USDA will report positive test results to the World Organization for Animal Health (known by the French acronym OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. APHIS will continue to announce the first case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state.

We treated nonsmoking (NS) and cigarette smoke (CS)-exposed mice intranasally with early (prophylactic) or late (therapeutic) IFN-β. We compared the mortality and innate immune responses of the treated mice following challenge with IAV. In NS mice, both early and late IFN-β administration decreased the survival rate in mice infected with IAV, with late IFN-β administration having the greatest effect on survival. In contrast, in CS-exposed mice, early IFN-β administration significantly increased survival during IAV infection while late IFN-β administration did not alter mortality. With regards to inflammation, in NS mice, IFN-β administration, especially late administration, significantly increased IAV-induced inflammation and lung injury. Early IFN-β administration to CS-exposed mice did not increase IAV-induced inflammation and lung injury as occurred in NS mice. Our results demonstrate, although IFN-β administration worsens the susceptibility of NS mice to influenza infection with increased immunopathology, early IFN-β administration to CS-exposed mice, which have suppression of the intrinsic IFN response, improved outcomes during influenza infection.

It is the primary cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and predisposes these subjects to severe respiratory tract infections1. Influenza A virus (IAV) is one of the most frequent triggers of COPD exacerbations which are a major cause of hospital admissions2. IAV infection in general is a major cause of infectious morbidity and mortality, and CS exposure alone is associated with more frequent and severe infections with IAV.The innate immune system is the first line of defense against infection. To initiate productive infection and to cause disease, IAV must overcome host defenses. The innate responses to IAV are triggered by recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns by three families of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs): Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I like helicases (RLRs) and nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat-containing proteins (NLRs). PRRs are capable of recognizing IAV and initiating the antiviral innate immune response. They do so through antiviral interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokine responses in order to contain the infection3. The IFN responses are central to antiviral immunity against viral infection. IFNs are further divided into type I (mainly IFN-α and β), II (IFN-γ) and III (IFN-λ) subtypes. When an IFN interacts with its unique cognate receptor, a signal is rapidly transmitted within the cell, leading to increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and augmented antiviral activity.We have shown that antiviral responses are suppressed by cigarette smoke (CS) exposure4,5. Specifically, we demonstrated that RIG-I and IFN-β mRNA induction by IAV were inhibited by CS in human cells and animals. CS exposure increased mortality in wild type (WT) mice infected with IAV. RIG-I overexpression in mice protects against CS-enhanced susceptibility to influenza infection6. Our recent data showed that deletion of RIG-I did not change survival rates or innate immune responses in vivo during IAV infection in mice7. The results suggest that suppression of multiple PRRs by CS in addition to RIG-I is required for functional immunosuppression.During influenza infection, type I IFNs can have beneficial antiviral effects or can worsen immunopathology, depending on the strain of IAV and the individual host8. Results from two research groups found administration of IFN-α protected animals from lethal challenge with IAV9,10. However, excessive type I IFN signaling or prolonged IFN administration during acute influenza infection may increase mortality11. In vitro, prophylactic exogenous IFN-β is effective to improve outcomes of IAV and highlights the potential for repeated doses to patients at risk during viral seasons of infection12.Influenza infection is not the only viral illness for which timing of the IFN response appears to play an important role in the consequences of disease. In Middle East respiratory syndrome–coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the relative timing of the type I IFN response is a key in determining outcomes in an animal model13.In this study, we focus on influenza infection. We wished to specifically address whether timing of IFN administration during influenza infection affected outcomes, and whether these effects were altered in the presence of suppression of the innate antiviral response by CS. We report that early and late IFN administration to normal nonsmoking (NS) mice worsened inflammation, acute lung injury (ALI), and mortality. In contrast, early IFN administration to CS-exposed mice enhanced the host PRR response to IAV infection and decreased mortality.ResultsIFN-β administration is detrimental for survival in lethal IAV infection in nonsmoking (NS) miceFirst, we confirmed that IFN-β administration induced innate immune responses in non-infected animals. Mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and treated with IFN-β (2,000 U) intranasally in a total volume of 50 μl in 0.1%BSA/PBS. Mock groups were sham treated with a single dose of intranasal sterile 0.1%BSA/PBS solution (diluent). We found that IFN-β induced robust innate immune responses in the mouse lung, including increased mRNA of RIG-I and the downstream transcription factor IRF7. Significantly, mRNA levels of interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10, a cytokine downstream of RIG-I and IFN-β) were induced 150-fold over mock (Fig. 1A).Figure 1IFN-β administration is detrimental for survival in lethal IAV infection in nonsmoking (NS) mice. (A) IFN-β administration induced robust innate immune responses in mouse lung. C57BL/6 mice were administrated with IFN-β (2000 U) intranasally in a total volume of 50 μl in 0.1%BSA/PBS. After 6 h, mouse lungs were collected. mRNA levels were assessed by qRT-PCR and normalized to β-actin. Bar graph represents mean ± standard deviation (n = 3). (B) Schematic of the experimental plan on early or late IFN-β administration and IAV infection to NS mice. Mortality (C) and body weights (D) during lethal IAV infection in IFN-β administrated NS mice. The mice treated with IFN-β (2000 U) intranasally either early (at 1 day before and 1 day after IAV infection) or late (at day 3 and 4 after IAV infection) in a total volume of 50 μl in 0.1%BSA/PBS. The mice were intranasally inoculated with IAV at 1000 PFU/mouse. Mortality and body weights were monitored daily. Body weight data were normalized to each mouse’s starting body weight. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n = 10 for all groups). # denotes significant survival rate difference between the NS and NS-Late IFN groups, p < 0.05. *Denotes significant weight loss difference between the NS and NS-Late IFN groups, p < 0.05.Full size imageIn order to determine whether IFN administration improves mortality in NS mice, we treated the mice intranasally with early IFN-β (NS-E) or late IFN-β (NS-L). In the early IFN group, mice were given IFN-β at 1 day before and 1 day after IAV infection (Fig. 1B). We did not observe weight loss in IFN-β treated animals prior to influenza infection. In the late IFN group, mice were given IFN-β at day 3 and 4 after IAV infection. In the NS group, mice were given sterile diluent at day 1 and 3 after IAV infection. We inoculated IFN-β treated or diluent treated animals with a lethal dose of virus (1000 PFU). This dose was selected to cause approximately 50% mortality (Lethal Dose, 50%; LD50) in NS mice. Death was recorded when mice were found dead in the cage or at 70% of original body weight. The mock group, which was sham inoculated with an equal volume of PBS, had no mortality and weight loss (not shown). Late IFN administration to NS mice significantly increased overall mortality during lethal dose viral infection by Fisher’s exact test (Fig. 1C). Early IFN administration to NS mice also appeared to increase mortality although the survival curve was not significant different. Specifically, early and late IFN administration had survival rates (NS Early IFN 30%; NS Late IFN 0%) compared to diluent treated animals (NS, 50%, n = 10 all groups). While mortality in the diluent treated group plateaued at 9 days post infection (p.i.), additional mortality occurred after this time p.i. in the IFN treatment groups, especially in NS Late IFN group (Fig. 1C). Weight loss occurred in all infected groups (Fig. 1D). The body weight data correlated with the survival data in that the lower survival groups lost more weight than groups with higher survival. Accordingly, the maximum body weight loss of IFN administration groups infected with IAV (29% and 31% loss for NS Early IFN and NS Late IFN respectively) was significantly greater than in the IAV infected diluent treated group (NS, 22% loss; Fig. 1D).Early IFN-β administration improves survival in CS-exposed mice during lethal IAV infectionWe have shown that CS exposure increased morbidity and mortality of IAV infection in mice14. We next evaluated the effect of IFN-β administration on mortality and weight loss during IAV infection in CS-exposed mice. Whole-body CS exposure was performed as described5. Briefly, mice were exposed to CS for 4 h per day for 6 weeks. Exposure was accomplished using a smoking chamber (Teague Enterprises, Davis, CA). After 6-week CS exposure, some of the mice were treated intranasally with IFN-β administration. All mice were inoculated with a lethal dose of PR8 virus (Fig. 2A). In Fig. 2B, C, after IAV infection (1000 PFU/mouse), CS-exposed mice had a lower survival rate than NS mice (0% for CS vs. 30% for NS mice). However, by Fisher’s exact test, early IFN-β administration to CS-exposed mice (CS Early IFN) significantly improved survival compared to diluent treated mice during IAV infection (30% survival for CS Early IFN group vs. 0% for CS group, p < 0.05). Morbidity was also decreased by early IFN-β administration, as early IFN-β-treated mice had less weight loss compared diluent treated mice (Fig. 2B). Thus, early IFN-β administration significantly reduced weight loss and improved survival in CS-exposed mice during IAV infection. We did not include the CS-Late IFN mice in the 1000 PFU/mouse dosage as we had already determined that late IFN administrated significantly worsened survival in NS animals. Thus, we would be unlikely to see an improvement in survival in these animals, particularly with the high mortality rate of untreated 1000 PFU exposed CS animals. This was confirmed in subsequent experiments using lower viral doses (see below).Figure 2Early IFN-β administration increased survival rates of CS-exposed IAV-infected mice. (A) Schematic of the experimental plan on CS exposure, early or late IFN-β administration and IAV infection. Mortality (B) and body weights (C) during lethal IAV infection (1000 PFU/mouse) in IFN-β administrated mice. Mortality (D) and body weights (E) during lethal IAV infection (500 PFU/mouse) in IFN-β administrated CS mice. The mice were exposed to CS for 6 weeks. Then, the mice were treated with IFN-β (2000 U) intranasally either early (at 1 day before and 1 day after IAV infection) or late (at day 3 and 4 after IAV infection) in a total volume of 50 μl in 0.1%BSA/PBS. Mortality and body weights were monitored daily. Body weight data were normalized to each mouse’s starting body weight. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n = 11 for CS group in B and C, n = 10 for other groups). # denotes significant survival rate difference between the CS and CS-Early IFN groups, p < 0.05. * denotes significant weight loss difference between the CS and CS-Early IFN groups, p < 0.05.Full size imageNext, we experimentally determined an LD50 for CS-exposed mice and discovered this dose was 500 PFU/animal. We used this dose in the next survival test on CS-exposed mice with or without IFN-β administration (Fig. 2D, E). As in CS mice infected with 1000 PFU/animal, early IFN-β administration improved survival compared to diluent treated mice at the LD50 for CS-exposed mice (80% for CS Early IFN vs. 50% for CS mice). Late IFN-β administration, on the contrary, decreased survival compared to diluent treated CS mice (30% for CS Late IFN vs. 50% for CS mice). The body weight data correlated with the survival data in that the highest survival group (CS Early IFN) lost significantly less weight than groups with lower survival. The data suggested that early IFN-β administration improved, while late IFN-β administration worsened, morbidity and mortality in CS-exposed mice during IAV infection.IFN-β administration increased inflammatory response in NS mice but not in CS-exposed mice during IAV infectionTo investigate the role of IFN-β administration in the inflammatory response to IAV, mice were inoculated intranasally with IAV at 500 PFU/mouse. The mock group was sham inoculated with an equal volume of PBS as a negative control. Animals were sacrificed by overdose isofluorane at 5 days p.i.We first determined the total inflammatory cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF). IAV inoculation increased the total viable leukocytes in BALF in mice. Both early (NS-E) and late (NS-L) IFN-β administration to NS mice significantly increased the total BAL cell numbers with late IFN-β administration showing the highest total BAL cell counts during the infection (Fig. 3A). CS exposure decreased the total BALF cell number during IAV infection (CS vs. NS) as we have previously shown6. Both early and late IFN-β administration to CS mice (CS-E and CS-L, respectively) did not increase total BALF cell numbers as was seen in NS-E and NS-L groups. These results showed that IFN-β administration increased immune cell influx into the lung in NS mice but not in CS-exposed mice during IAV infection.Figure 3Lung injury and cellularity in the lungs. CS exposure, early or late IFN-β administration and IAV infection are the same as Fig. 2A. Each mouse was infected with 500 PFU of IAV. Mock treated mice were inoculated with PBS. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or lung tissue was harvested at day 5 after infection. Total immune cells (A) in BALF and ratio of lung/body weight (B) were determined. Data are expressed as means ± SEM (n ≥ 4/group). *denotes significant difference between the two groups, p < 0.05. ND = no significant difference between the two groups.Full size imageIAV induced lung injury was characterized by examining the lung-to-body weight ratio. The lung-to-body weight ratio is an indicator for ALI and is also an indirect measure of the lung inflammatory response15,16. IAV infection of mice significantly increased lung-to-body weight ratio (NS vs. Mock, p < 0.05, Fig. 3B). Early or late IFN-β administration to NS mice also increased the ratio with late IFN-β administration (NS-L) causing a significant increase in the ratio over induced by infection alone (NS vs. NS-L, p < 0.05, Fig. 3B). In contrast, IFN-β administration to CS-exposed mice did not increase the ratio as seen in NS mice after infection (Fig. 3B). Thus, IFN-β administration increased lung injury and cellular influx in NS mice but not in CS-exposed mice during IAV infection.Effect of IFN administration on lung histopathology during IAV infectionThe IAV-infected groups displayed a typical histopathological pattern for viral pneumonia, including severe bronchi and bronchioles inflammation characterized by epithelial cell necrosis and sloughing with partial to complete airway obstruction by intact and degenerate neutrophils and cellular debris, and varying degrees of acute intra-alveolar edema and/or hemorrhage (Supplemental Fig. 1). IAV infection also resulted in the expected neutrophilic alveolar infiltrate with some lymphocytes (Supplemental Fig. 1C and D). Histopathologic scoring of the cardinal features of IAV infection (Fig. 4A) was evaluated as in a previous publication by a pathologist (JWR) blinded to the treatment groups17. Consistent with the total inflammatory cells and lung-to-body ratio data, early or late IFN-β administration to NS mice appeared to result in higher overall pathologic scores than other groups with NS-L having the highest pathologic score among all groups (Fig. 4B). Scores in the CS group were higher than in the NS group. In contrasts to the effects seen in the NS groups, IFN-β administration to CS mice caused no difference in the severity of inflammation in these mice. From gross observation, we found that lungs from NS-E, NS-L and CS-L mice had the most prominent lung hemorrhage among the groups (Fig. 4C).Figure 4Mouse lung tissue pathology after IAV infection. CS exposure, early or late IFN-β administration and IAV infection are the same as Fig. 2A. Each mouse was infected with 500 PFU of IAV PR8. Animals were sacrificed at 5 days after infection and lung tissue was harvested. Lung tissue sections prepared from the infected mice were fixed, processed and stained with hematoxylin–eosin (A). Histopathologic evaluation and scoring of IAV infection were determined by a blinded pathologist (B). The lungs of 5 mice from each treatment group were processed for histology, and results shown were typical for the group. The arrows indicate infiltrated neutrophils, edema or hemorrhage. (C) Gross pathologic images of IAV-infected lungs. The image shown is representative of 5 mice lungs from each treatment group.Full size imageEarly IFN-β administration to CS-exposed mice restored innate PRR and cytokine responses to influenza infectionWe measured PRRs and their downstream cytokine expression during infection in all mouse groups. Mice were inoculated intranasally with a single dose of the IAV PR8 strain (500 PFU). Lung tissues and BALF were collected at 5 days after infection. mRNA or protein expression was determined by qRT-PCR or multiplex immunoassay, respectively. CS exposure suppressed RIG-I and TLR3 induction by IAV in mice compared to that in NS mice (Fig. 5 CS vs. NS). Early IFN-β administration significantly increased RIG-I mRNA induction by virus infection in CS mice (Fig. 5 CS-E vs. CS, P < 0.05). CS-E also restored IFN-β mRNA induction and increased IFN-λ mRNA induction by IAV infection.Figure 5Early IFN-β administration to CS-exposed mice induced an unimpaired antiviral response to influenza infection. CS exposure, early or late IFN-β administration and IAV infection are the same as Fig. 2A. Mice were infected with 500 PFU of IAV. The mice were sacrificed at day 5 post infection and mRNA levels in the lungs were assessed by qRT-PCR and normalized by β-actin. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 5). * denotes significant difference between the two groups, p < 0.05.Full size imageConsistent with the histopathology data, NS-L had the most robust proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, TNFα and IL-8 mRNA induction among all the groups (Fig. 5). CS-E did not change the induction of these cytokines compared to the CS group. In terms of viral RNA expression, the NS-E and NS-L groups had the most IAV M protein mRNA expression, which indicated IFN-β administration to NS mice might impair viral clearance and was unhelpful to contain the viral replication in the lung as compared to NS mice (Fig. 5 last panel). This does not occur in the CS-E group, which had decreased mortality during lethal IAV infection, as viral replication as evidenced by M protein mRNA levels was not enhanced by early IFN-β administration. In contrast in the CS-L group, M protein mRNA levels were increased, suggesting enhancement of viral replication by late administration of IFN-β. Lungs were also processed for immunohistochemistry for detection of IAV nucleoprotein (NP)18. The mock group showed minimal background immunofluorescence when stained for NP (Fig. 6). Viral NP expression was more widely and evenly distributed in the lungs of NS-E, NS-L and CS-L mice while the expression was more isolated in NS, CS, and CS-E mice (Fig. 6). The results suggested that virus replicated more rapidly in NS-E, NS-L and CS-L groups compared to NS, CS, and CS-E groups.Figure 6IFN-β administration altered IAV replication in mouse lung. CS exposure, early or late IFN-β administration and IAV infection of the mice were performed as in Fig. 2A. Mice were infected with 500 PFU of IAV or PBS (mock). The mice were sacrificed at day 5 post infection. Mouse lungs were processed for immunohistochemistry for detection of IAV nucleoprotein (NP, red) using an anti-NP polyclonal antibody labelled with Alexa Fluor 594. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) and were shown in overlaid images with NP. The lungs of 3 mice from each treatment group were processed for immunohistochemistry, and results shown were typical for the groups. The bar represents 100 μm for all the images.Full size imageTo characterize the cytokine induction at the level of translation, we measured cytokine proteins in mouse BALF in all groups using multiplex immunoassay (Fig. 7). Again, NS-L had the most proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, TNFα and MCP-1 protein induction by IAV among all the groups. CS exposure reduced induction of IFN-α and IFN-β protein in IAV infected mice (CS vs. NS). Early IFN-β administration to CS mice appeared to enhance IFN-α protein induction by IAV. In contrast, we did not find any apparent IFN-β protein changes among any of our groups. The current study was designed to look at changes in cytokine levels just prior to animal death. Therefore, early changes in IFN-β caused by CS (day 1–4 p.i.) or by IFN-β administration were not captured. Taken together, these results demonstrate that early, but not late IFN-β administration to CS-exposed mice (CS-E) boosted the antiviral response without enhancing proinflammatory cytokine levels. In NS mice, both early and late IFN-β administration significantly enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, TNFα and MCP-1) levels in mouse lungs.Figure 7Antiviral and proinflammatory cytokine protein levels in BALF from mice. CS exposure, early or late IFN-β administration and IAV infection are the same as Fig. 2A. Mice were infected with 500 PFU of IAV. BALF were harvested at day 5 post infection. Mock treated mice were inoculated with PBS. Antiviral and proinflammatory cytokine protein levels were determined by multiplex immunoassay. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n ≥ 4 per group). * denotes significant difference between the two groups, p < 0.05.Full size imageDiscussionIAV attacks the human upper respiratory tract and lung cells, and causes significant seasonal or pandemic morbidity and mortality. Autopsy of the lungs of succumbed patients always reveals diffuse alveolar disease, but viral RNA is present in only a subset of patients. The most significant histopathological findings of fatal influenza cases are pulmonary hyaline membranes and septal edema consistent with diffuse alveolar damage, tracheitis, and necrotizing bronchiolitis. Other early changes include pulmonary vascular congestion and, in some cases, alveolar hemorrhage19. Experimental and clinical studies have identified overly exuberant systemic inflammation as an important pathophysiologic mechanism correlating with ALI and disease severity. Inadequate viral clearance may be a less important contributor to the outcome in IAV infection20.The role of IFN in acute influenza infection is complicated. Type I IFNs can have defensive antiviral effects or contribute to immunopathology21. Here, we tried to determine the therapeutic effects of different IFN administration times on NS and CS-exposed mice during IAV infection. Although IFN-β administration to NS mice increased mortality to IAV, early, but not late, IFN-β administration to CS-exposed mice decreased mortality during influenza infection. Comparative analyses of inflammation and ALI in these mice revealed that the host response to IAV differs significantly in pro-inflammatory activity. IFN-β administration to NS mice had the strongest pro-inflammatory responses to virus infection with an increase in differential expression of genes associated with inflammation, such as IL-6, TNF-α and IL-8. This is consisted with our current knowledge about the role of IFNs in inflammation and inflammasome activation22. Our results further confirmed the work by Davidson et al. which found that excessive type I IFN signaling in reaction to IAV infection can lead to uncontrolled inflammation11. In clinical flu cases, IFNs were robustly induced earlier at high levels23. Another study also demonstrated that virus-induced type I IFN-related pathways were stimulated during the initial four days of symptomatic influenza in hospitalized patients24. Thus, NS mice themselves have similar kinetics of IFN responses to IAV infection as do humans. Our findings suggest that IFN-β treatment, especially late IFN, to healthy NS people infected with flu would only exaggerate the IFN levels in the host and exogenous IFNs promote pro-inflammatory responses and recruit extra granulocytes and monocytes to the lung, which would contribute to worse disease outcomes.It is a different story for CS-exposed mice or human smokers. We found that early IFN-β administration to CS mice raised IFN to an optimal level to control viral replication while imposing minimal damage on host cells. Our previous work has demonstrated that CS exposure suppressed antiviral responses to IAV infection in these mice4,5. Early IFN-β administration to CS mice restored the CS-suppressed RIG-I-initiated antiviral responses but did not promote excessive inflammation and ALI in the lung. The result will help design strategies for the development of IFN treatments to mitigate the adverse consequences of virus infection in immunocompromised people, such as smokers and aged. In these people, IFNs are induced less because of the suppressed immune responses of the host. On the other hand, early IFN treatment may protect the patients who are infected with weak IFN triggering viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). An in vitro study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 does not trigger an IFN response in primary human airway epithelial (pHAE) but is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs25. In hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, IFN production was both decreased and delayed, induced only in a portion of patients as they became critically ill23. Single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated weak type I IFN induction in the myeloid cells of patients with severe COVID-19, and brief expression of IFN-stimulated genes26. Transcriptome analyses found that patients with COVID-19 had profoundly impaired induction of type I IFNs juxtaposed to exuberant inflammatory cytokine production23,27. Highly impaired type I IFN activity is a hallmark of severe COVID-1928. Thus, exogenous early IFN treatment would modify the host innate responses to react more appropriately to the viruses, which suppress the normal IFN response in the host in a similar manner as smoking. Murine models of SARS-CoV-1 infection showed that late IFN production is associated with lung lesions and high mortality whereas early administration of IFN prevents lung damage13. Most importantly, one recent publication confirmed that IFN administration may be efficacious during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasal administration of type I IFN reduced the viral load and lung pathology in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters29.Taken together, we showed here that IFN-β administration to NS mice led to uncontrolled inflammation and ALI, and decreased viral containment in the NS. Late IFN-β administration in CS mice had a similar effect. However, early IFN-β administration to CS-exposed mice played protective roles against mortality and morbidity during IAV infection (Fig. 8). It appears, therefore, that the effects of IFN-β administration during viral infection depends on the pre-existing state of the antiviral response. If the response is normal, then IFN administration may be harmful. However, if the antiviral response is impaired, administration of IFN may be helpful during viral infection. Enhancing our knowledge of pulmonary host defenses is of central importance to the development of new strategies to treat and prevent IAV infection, particularly in high-risk groups, including those exposed to CS. The timing of IFN exposition to immunosuppressed people or specific virus infection, which tend to induce weak IFN response in the host, may be crucial to limit the viral reproduction and avoid immunopathogenesis.Figure 8Proposed model for IFN administration to NS and CS-exposed mice during IAV infection.Full size imageMaterials and methodsEthics statementThe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center approved all of the protocols for the animal experiments (protocol number: 17–106-HI). The facility where this research was conducted is accredited by AAALAC. The facility operates according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations and the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All procedures were performed by personnel trained in the techniques according to IACUC guidelines. All invasive clinical procedures were performed while animals were anesthetized. In compliance with the Animal Welfare Act principles, we reduced the number of animals sacrificed by omitting control groups for which comparative effects are already known. The animals were sacrificed by overdose isofluorane. Our report follows the recommendations in the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines.Preparation of influenza virus stock and plaque assays30 Influenza virus, A/PR/34/8 (PR8), was passaged in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK, ATCC, Manassas, VA) cells. Virus was grown in MDCK cells in DMEM/F12 with ITS + (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in the presence of TPCK-trypsin, harvested at 72 h post-infection. There was no detectable endotoxin in the final viral preparations used in the experiments as determined by limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD). The lower limit of detection of this assay is 0.1 EU/ml or approximately 20 pg/ml LPS. The virus was titered by plaque assay in MDCK cells, aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C.Whole-body CS exposure5 C57BL/6 mice were exposed to the smoke of 1R6F reference cigarettes (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY) for 4 h per day. Mice receiving CS were gradually brought up to the target exposure over a period of 2 weeks, and treated 5 days/week for 6 weeks. Treatment was administered by placing mice in a Plexiglas smoking chamber (Teague Enterprises, Davis, CA). Smoke exposure was standardized to total suspended particles = 90 mg/m3, 11% mainstream and 89% sidestream smoke in the chamber of the machine. The exposure level was assessed by measuring serum cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, at 1 h after exposure (Cotinine ELISA Kit, GenWay Biotech Inc.). After six-week exposure, the average serum cotinine was 513 ± 256 ng/ml, near levels in human cigarette smokers31. “Nonsmoking” (NS) treatment groups were conducted for the same periods of time, but mice were exposed to filtered room air.IFN-β administration and Influenza virus infectionIFN-β administration and IAV infection were performed under isoflurane anesthesia. Animals that died during anesthesia were removed from subsequent calculations of mortality. The mice were treated with IFN-β (2000 U) intranasally in a total volume of 50 μl in 0.1%BSA/PBS. Control groups were sham treated with a single dose of intranasal sterile 0.1%BSA/PBS solution. IAV PR8 stock was diluted in PBS to make lethal doses of virus. These virus doses (50 µl solution) were administered by intranasal instillation as the animal was held in a vertical position while sedated. Two doses were chosen to achieve an LD50 in NS (1000 PFU), or CS (500 PFU) animals. The mock group was sham inoculated with an equal volume of PBS. Mice were monitored daily for 16 days for clinical symptoms (shaking, inactivity and piloerection) and their weight was recorded daily.Multiplex immunoassayCytokine protein levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were determined by multiplex immunoassay (Eve Technologies, Calgary, AB, Canada). All samples were twofold diluted in 1% triton X-100 (final) for decontamination.Measurement of mRNA expression by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)Total RNA from lung was extracted using a modified TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) protocol and spectrophometrically quantitated. The integrity of RNA was verified by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis. Equal amounts (1 µg) of RNA from each sample were reverse-transcripted into cDNA with oligo (dT) SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Gene specific primers for mouse PRRs, cytokines and the β-actin housekeeping genes were used. The primers’ sequences were the same as in our earlier publication6. qRT-PCR was performed using 100 ng sample RNA and SYBR Green (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) in a Bio-Rad CFX96™ Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System. Results were calculated and graphed from the ΔCT of target gene and normalizer, β-actin.Histological and immunohistochemistry analysis of mouse lungAt day 5 after IAV infection, mice were sacrificed and lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 30 min, and were then embedded in paraffin. Fixed tissue was hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stained to assess inflammation and fibrosis. Histopathologic scoring of the cardinal features of IAV infection was evaluated using a modified histological scoring system in a previous publication17. Briefly, four easily identifiable pathological processes were chosen in order to grade, semiquantitatively, on a scale of 0–4: alveolar and interstitial oedema; haemorrhage; margination; and infiltration of inflammatory cells and formation of bronchiolitis. A score of 0 represented normal lungs; 1 represented mild; 2 moderate; 3 severe; and 4 very severe histopathological changes. The results of histopathological changes were expressed as mean ± SEM (three sections from each lung, 5 lungs per group) on each group. Sections (3–5 μm) were mounted on glass slides and immuno-probed with an anti-NP polyclonal antibody18. After washing, the sections were probed with a donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (BD/Molecular Probes). Transmitted light and fluorescent microscopy images were obtained from an Olympus BX51 microscope running Cellsens imaging software (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA).Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc correction for multiple comparisons. Survival rate significance was determined by Fisher’s exact test. For RT-PCR results, the p value was calculated from the ΔCt values from different experimental groups. Significance was considered as p < 0.05.Ethics statementThe animal research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (Approval number 101089-14-152-HI).

That means it could join the flu and other respiratory viruses that tend to spread during the cold winter months.Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe U.S. is averaging 49,569 new Covid cases a day, according to an NBC News tally, a decrease of more than 54 percent over the past two weeks. Covid-related death numbers are also falling, now averaging 1,533 per day, a reduction of about a third over the past two weeks. Despite the positive Covid trends, CDC officials say it is increasingly likely that the coronavirus will never truly go away, instead simmering at low levels and rising in the winter. "This virus will probably continue to circulate in our society, in our country, around the world for years to come," said Dr. Henry Walke, the director of the CDC's Center for Preparedness and Response. "This next six months, the next year, will really inform us in terms of what living with this virus is going to look like."But, he added, he hopes the most recent surge, driven by the extremely contagious omicron variant, will be "the last real large surge from SARS-CoV-2."While the CDC says 90 percent of people in the U.S. can take off their masks now, Walensky said she can't guarantee that masks will be gone forever. That means they could one day make a comeback.I would say, put your masks in a drawer, anticipate you may need them again and hope we don't.Dr. Rochelle Walensky, cdc director"I would say put your masks in a drawer, anticipate you may need them again and hope that we don't," she said. "We may want to be more vigilant during some seasons," Walensky said. "Maybe during respiratory season, if things ramped up, we would want to put on our masks again to protect both from flu and from Covid and from all other respiratory diseases."It's also unclear whether people will need additional Covid booster shots over the next year, she said. Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe omicron variant continues to be the dominant strain of the virus detected in the U.S., currently accounting for more than 99 percent of new cases. The CDC is actively looking for new variants, analyzing tens of thousands of genomic sequences every week. It says it sees no evidence of new variants on the horizon.Still, Walke said he does expect additional variants to emerge. "This virus has surprised us again and again and again," he said. "We don't know what the future holds."But he added that if a new variant does pop up again, the nation is in a better position to react quickly by testing for it and reformulating vaccines, if necessary.

By TZVI JOFFRE MARCH 6, 2022 05:47 Updated: MARCH 6, 2022 17:13 A sign warns about the avian influenza in an area of Randers, Denmark November 17, 2020 (photo credit: VIA REUTERS) Eurasian H5 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) poses a low risk to public health, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said on Friday, as cases of the virus were reported in birds in at least 13 states.Where were bird flu outbreaks found?Outbreaks were found in domesticated flocks in Maryland, Missouri, Indiana, Connecticut and Iowa last week, as the virus continued to spread across North America, according to the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).A flock of commercial layer chickens in Cecil County, Maryland, a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Stoddard County, Missouri, a commercial flock of turkeys in Dubois County, Indiana, and two non-commercial backyard flocks in Connecticut and Iowa were found to be infected with HPAI. The first confirmed case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in a US commercial flock since 2020 was detected in a turkey flock in Indiana earlier this month. The flock was infected with the H5N1 subtype, the same strain detected in mid-January in wild birds in North Carolina when the first cases of HPAI this season were detected in the US.As of Saturday, over 300 wild birds in South and North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware, Alabama, Kentucky, Maine, New Jersey, Florida, Massachusetts and Tennessee had been found to be infected with Eurasian H5 HPAI, with a number of cases specified as H5N1. A sign warns about the avian influenza in an area of Randers, Denmark November 17, 2020 (credit: VIA REUTERS)While the risk to the general public's health is considered low, some people who have job-related or recreational exposure to birds may have a higher risk of infection. The CDC stated that it "is watching this situation closely and taking routine preparedness and prevention measures in case this virus changes to pose a greater human health risk."A Northern Europe "export"A preprint study by scientists from the USDA which has not yet been peer-reviewed found evidence that the latest outbreak of bird flu in North America was transmitted from Northern Europe over the Atlantic Ocean, the first documented introduction of a Eurasian HPAI via the Atlantic Flyway to the US. The study also found that while HPAI in wild birds was usually tied to spillover from domestic birds, it seems that such viruses are now being maintained in wild bird populations as well, with researchers adding that this highlights the importance of monitoring wild birds.The CDC noted that while the H5N1 viruses detected in late 2021 and 2022 are different from earlier H5N1 viruses, they still lack changes seen in the past that have been associated with viruses spreading more easily among poultry, infecting people more easily and causing severe illness in people.There is little information available concerning the spectrum of illness that could result from human infections with the newest H5N1 viruses, as only one such human infection has been reported. The patient, a man who raised ducks in the UK, did not have any symptoms. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now The CDC added that an H6 candidate vaccine virus produced by the CDC could be used to produce a vaccine for the current H5N1 virus, if necessary, and that the current virus can be detected by existing diagnostic tools and treated with existing antiviral medications.A large number of bird flu outbreaks have been reported throughout Europe, Africa and Asia in recent weeks and months, mostly due to the H5N1 subtype, which comes from the H5 lineage, according to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The organization warned that a further increase in outbreaks is expected in the coming months.According to a recent update by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), at least 930 outbreaks of HPAI have been detected in animals since January 26, 2022. 10 new cases in humans were reported in China, as well. A study in late January by the Pirbright Institute and the UK Animal and Plant Health Agency found that the H9N2 and H7N9 strains of avian influenza could share genetic information to create an H9N9 strain that could cause more severe disease in poultry and potentially cause disease in humans as well. The H9N9 strain can infect and be transmitted between ferrets and has a higher replication rate in human cells.The study, published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Virology, showed that strains already circulating in poultry populations can exchange genetic material and create new strains which can pose a greater risk to poultry and humans."This is the first study to show that infection with circulating H9N2 and H7N9 influenza viruses could create new virus strains such as H9N9 that cause more disease in poultry and pose a greater risk to human health," said Professor Munir Iqbal, head of the Avian Influenza Group at Pirbright. "More research is needed to determine which avian flu viruses could combine and pose a threat to poultry and human health."Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags disease US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC bird flu Hot Opinion Dear Jared Kushner, the Jewish people need you By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

Luckily, flu cases remained far lower than usual. By Ed Cara Published March 11, 2022 | Comments (0) | ð Copied! A nurse practitioner prepares to administer a flu vaccination. Photo: Joe Raedle (Getty Images) This winterâs flu vaccine was a particularly bad match for the most common influenza strain in circulation, a new analysis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. Thankfully, the flu season was much milder than usual for the second year in a row, as ongoing covid-19 precautions likely blunted the spread of flu as well. The estimates come from the CDCâs long-running surveillance program of people with suspected flu-like symptoms who visit various outpatient sites throughout the country. Overall, the odds of catching a case of confirmed flu were only slightly lower for vaccinated people, the researchers found. Against all flu strains detected at these sites, the vaccine was deemed to be 14% effective, as well as 16% effective at preventing cases of flu from A(H3N2) viruses, the predominant strain this winter. Numbers this low are far below the 50% threshold for a vaccine to be considered relatively useful, and theyâre not even high enough to reach statistical significance. In the words of the researchers, who published their results in the CDCâs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the vaccine âdid not reduce the risk for outpatient respiratory illness caused by influenza A(H3N2) viruses that have predominated so far this season.â Flu vaccines, even in a good year, are far from perfect. The strains of influenza virus that infect humans are constantly evolving, meaning that scientists have totry to predict what these strains will look like during the next flu season so that they can match them to the strains included in the vaccine (the vaccine will usually include four strains at a time). This guessing game often results in a vaccine thatâs around 50% to 60% effective, but sometimes, as is the case this year, the mismatch can get worse. It doesnât help that this yearâs main flu is H3N2, a subtype of flu already known for being harder to predict than others. The lucky break this winter is that the flu has taken another hiatus. Cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are well under historical trends, though not as quite as low as they were during the 2020-2021 winter flu season. (Those numbers were so low then that the CDC couldnât even estimate that seasonâs vaccine effectiveness.) The fewÂ cases seen in the previous season probably made predicting this yearâs flu season even harder. The meekness of the past two flu seasons has been attributed to public health measures meant to slow down the transmission of the much more contagious SARS-CoV-2, including the regular wearing of masks. Last month, the World Health Organization issued its recommendations on the flu vaccines meant for next winter in the Northern hemisphere, which included calling for updates to the H3N2 strains used as a reference. But the CDC authors note that âpredicting circulation of virus subtypes and predominant clades within subtypes remains challenging.â Just because this yearâs flu vaccine may have been a dud, though, doesnât mean theyâre not worth taking. In a typical year, flu vaccines arethought to prevent millions of flu cases, tens of thousands of hospitalizations, and at least thousands of deaths, despite the fact that only around half of all Americans even get vaccinated. There are also next-generation flu vaccines close to development, which might allow for a better match to circulating strains. And the allure of a universal or longer-lasting flu vaccine is still tantalizingly within grasp. The past two winters should also remind us that bad flu seasons donât have to be inevitable, even in the absence of highly effective vaccines.

Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on March 9, 2022 Close Photo: USDA Since February 8, 15.6 million commercial and backyard birds across 17 states have been depopulated because of avian influenza infections. Once one bird has tested positive, the entire flock must be depopulated to reduce the spread of the disease. Avian influenza, also referred to as bird flu, is a type A influenza that can affect all species of birds. There are two designations of avian influenza: highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic avian influenza. "The two are essentially the same virus, other than how they affect the birds and how contagious and deadly the strain is," says Dr. Yuko Sato, poultry extension veterinarian and diagnostician at Iowa State University. "The designation indicates how likely it is to kill the birds. It has nothing to do with how infectious the virus is for people or for other mammals." HPAI can manifest in a variety of ways in commercial and backyard birds: dying without clinical signs; lack of energy; decreased egg production; soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; swelling or purple discoloration of the head, eyelids, comb, and hocks; nasal discharge; coughing; sneezing; incoordination; and diarrhea. The USDA has a resource with images to help identify discoloration and other clinical signs. Usually, wild birds can carry HPAI without displaying symptoms and can introduce the virus to farms without raising concerns. However, Sato says this particular strain of HPAI, H5N1, appears to also be deadly to wild geese and ducks. Since January 13, 482 wild birds have been reported to have HPAI. Wild bird detection is done through targeted sampling, Sato says. Hunters, landowners, and others call in when they suspect a bird has died from HPAI or is infected. The USDA has a list of specific geographic areas that have high mixing of wild bird populations in which they collect samples from. "It's not really a matter of if another outbreak occurs, it's a matter of when," says Sato. "We've detected it. We've seen it in wild waterfowl, we've definitely seen it in commercial poultry. The only thing producers can do to prepare for this is to have good biosecurity." Sato says the best way to think about biosecurity is keeping the outside out and the inside in. Controlling movement, educating workers on sources of infection, changing clothes and boots, showering in and out, and other basic standards of sanitation are great ways to mitigate infection points. Keeping in mind the ways that HPAI can spread—through saliva, nasal secretions, and feces—is also important. HPAI is always fatal. There is no treatment, cure, or vaccination, so preventing the virus from entering the premises is the only way to keep your flock safe. "It takes a village to control an outbreak," says Sato. "It's really a cooperation between the poultry industry and the state and federal levels. We are all pieces of the puzzle." Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

The number of people with flu increased significantly last week. An increasing number of samples taken from people with flu-like symptoms contain the influenza virus that causes flu. Based on information from laboratories, hospitals, GPs and the Municipal Health Services (GGDs), a flu epidemic seems to be emerging. That is the conclusion of Nivel, Erasmus MC and RIVM. Since the start of the flu season in October 2021, the flu virus has been found very occasionally in the Netherlands. This infrequent occurrence is probably due to the coronavirus measures, which also prevent the flu virus from spreading. Now that many measures have been discontinued, people are having contact with others more often again. This also increases the risk of respiratory infections such as flu. Uncertainty regarding normal criteria for flu epidemic In the Netherlands, an outbreak of influenza is considered a flu epidemic when more than 58 in 100,000 people go to their GP with flu-like symptoms and at least 10% of these people have the influenza virus, and this persists for two weeks in a row. This is monitored by the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (Nivel) and RIVM. Through a national network, GP practices report how many people they see with flu-like symptoms. They take throat and nose samples from some of these people. Laboratory testing is performed to determine whether they actually have the flu virus. The symptoms of influenza are very similar to those of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, people who have flu-like symptoms are currently going to a GGD test lane or using a COVID-19 self-test. Fewer people with respiratory infections are going to their GP compared to previous years. As a result, the normal criteria for identifying a flu epidemic are very uncertain in this situation. Information from laboratories, hospitals and GGDs RIVM is also monitoring trends in the influenza virus in other ways. Various laboratories in the Netherlands reported last week that the number of people with flu is increasing significantly. Since November 2021, some of the samples for COVID-19 from the GGD test lanes in Amsterdam and Utrecht have been examined to check for influenza viruses. These results also show an upward trend. Finally, various hospitals report rising numbers of people with flu. Based on this information, a flu epidemic seems to be emerging. RIVM, Nivel and Erasmus MC are carefully monitoring the further development of this situation. Flu and COVID-19 Flu and COVID-19 are both infections of the respiratory system. However, they are caused by different viruses. Both viruses spread through droplets that are released during coughing or sneezing. In addition, both viruses cause fever, cold symptoms and coughing, and sometimes lead to pneumonia. The basic measures to prevent the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 from spreading are also effective in preventing the spread of the influenza virus. Washing your hands regularly, coughing and sneezing into your elbow, and distancing all help reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to others. Keep this in mind, especially when interacting with vulnerable groups of people. They could become seriously ill from the influenza virus.

The agencies involved in the investigation have also reiterated "birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system.""While Delmarva's chicken community has worked hard to prevent avian influenza from affecting their flocks and was able to keep the 2015 U.S. HPAI outbreak from impacting us, the ease with which this disease can spread from bird to bird means HPAI poses a significant risk to broiler chickens," said Holly Porter, Delmarva Chicken Association executive director, in statement concerning the recent cases.Saturday's case was also investigated by MDA and the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. This comes a week after another positive result was found in a commercial flock in Delaware.According to MDA, Maryland and its federal and state partners have "expanded their surveillance sampling and testing regimen" to better protect the poultry industry on the Delmarva Peninsula.To prevent the spread of the virus, depopulation of the affected birds has begun in Cecil County and nothing from the facility will enter the supply chain. The farm is under a strict quarantine, with only authorized personnel allowed on the premises.IN DELAWARE: Bird flu found in Delaware commercial chicken flock; how you can protect yourselfCONTAINMENT: Bird flu: What the Delmarva chicken industry is doing to stop the spread of the disease“Avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain healthy and safe to eat and handle," said Maryland Agriculture Secretary Joe Bartenfelder. "All poultry growers, operators and owners, including those who manage backyard flocks, must remain vigilant."No human bird flu infections have been reported from proper handling of poultry meat or from eating properly cooked poultry or poultry products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Bartenfelder underscored that MDA, USDA and other partner agencies are working diligently to address and localize the situation, including quarantining and testing nearby flocks.Among birds, HPAI is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers."It has appeared sporadically over the last several decades in bird populations throughout the globe," MDA said in a statement announcing the positive results. "Wild birds can carry the virus without becoming sick, while domesticated birds can become very sick."In humansAccording to the CDC: "Avian influenza viruses usually do not infect people, although rare cases of human infection with these viruses have been reported."The first human infection in the U.S. was identified in 1959."The spread of avian influenza viruses from one ill person to another has been reported very rarely, and when it has been reported it has been limited, inefficient and not sustained," the CDC said in an overview of the illness.From 1997 to now, more than 880 people worldwide were infected, with approximately a 50% case fatality proportion. That includes 20 cases and seven deaths in Hong Kong between 1997 and 2003.From 1997 to now, more than 880 people worldwide were infected, with approximately a 50% case fatality proportion. That includes 20 cases and seven deaths in Hong Kong between 1997 and 2003.One case of asymptomatic infection was reported in Vietnam in 2011 and one of case of asymptomatic infection was reported in the U.K. in 2021.Infections have been reported in more than 60 people in China since 2014 and one case was reported in Laos in 2021.Virus infections were reported in a small number of asymptomatic people in Russia in 2020.The main risk factor to humans is the direct or indirect exposure to infected animals or environments and surfaces contaminated by feces, according to the Pan American Health Organization.Biosecurity and outbreaksIn the event of an outbreak, strict farm biosecurity measures would mean the general public is not allowed to enter a farm and those granted access would be monitored and recorded.In an effort to stop the spread of the virus, stringent efforts would be made to clean and disinfect everything from footwear worn on the property and vehicles coming off the property.In 2004, a different strain of avian flu was found at two Delaware farms and one near Pocomoke City in Maryland. To control that outbreak, 205,000 chickens were killed and composted inside their chickenhouses as officials imposed quarantine zones for miles around the affected farms.Detection of the HPAI H5 virus began again in December 2014 when the CDC found positive cases into mid-June 2015. During that time, virus detections were reported in 21 U.S. states.The estimated national economic loss, according to federal data, from that outbreak totaled $1 billion.Poultry litter management: Sussex bioenergy facility draws mixed reaction from environmental groups, residentsThat included 15 states with outbreaks in domestic poultry or captive birds, and six states with H5 detections in wild birds only.In 2017, the Eastern Shore suffered another HPAI scare in which 40,000 commercial birds were euthanized.

Zecchinelli and his wife, Karen, own the nearby Wayside Restaurant now. It's become a Vermont institution. "Effie Ballou opened the Wayside in July of 1918, and two months later the pandemic hits Barre," he said. Zecchinelli has never stopped thinking about how little he knew about the 1918 flu – and the fact that the grandfather he never met was one of its victims. He died at 35, on October 10 of that terrible year. Germinio Zecchinelli, like so many other Italian stone cutters, had moved to Barre to quarry granite, to carve the nation's gravestones (and often each others', as it turned out)."The Spanish Flu is often referred to as the 'forgotten flu,'" Zecchinelli told correspondent Martha Teichner. "And if we had anything to do with it, it wasn't gonna be forgotten, Germinio and all the others. We wanted to do something to memorialize him and the 50 million others worldwide that died." Because, to his astonishment, there was no substantial monument – anywhere – in spite of the staggering number of dead. The forgotten pandemic, indeed. So, in 2018, a century after the fact, Zecchinelli commissioned this one. "It is unbelievable that nothing else had been done," he said." Brian Zecchinelli, with correspondent Martha Teichner, at the memorial for those who died in the 1918 influenza pandemic, at Hope Cemetery in Barre, Vt. CBS News Six-hundred-seventy-five thousand Americans died in that pandemic. We're at nearly a million and counting dead from COVID. Has history taught us anything? Tulane University scholar John Barry, who wrote the definitive history of the 1918 flu, "The Great Influenza," said, "This time around it confirmed the lesson from 1918: you tell the truth."You heard things like - this is all about the 1918 virus - 'This is ordinary influenza by another name,' which of course, it wasn't. It's crystal clear that Trump himself knowingly said things that weren't true" (such as his February 27, 2020 statement: "It's going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear"). Penguin And what did confusion over the constantly-evolving science do to trust and compliance? (Dr. Anthony Fauci's March 8, 2020 statement, "There's no reason to be walking around with a mask," vs. Fauci's Oct. 29, 2020 support for community COVID protocols, "the flagship of which is wearing a mask.")"You know, trust, truth, they're all interconnected," Barry said. Teichner asked, "Was the result the same then and now?""Well, clearly people who might otherwise have been alive, died in 1918," he replied. "And clearly this time around, people didn't believe the truth when they were told the truth. The misinformation, the active attacks on vaccines, there's no question it's killed people."Martha Lincoln, a medical anthropologist at San Francisco State University, sees 1918 amnesia happening again. "We're already forgetting, even before the pandemic is over. We're already forgetting the pandemic. I foresee, at best, a long struggle about whether we will remember, really, at all, and if we remember, what that memory will be." For example, our entertainment, Lincoln said, is like some parallel universe where COVID is invisible, or long gone. Not everyone is choosing to forget. In Barre, Vt, the self-proclaimed granite center of the world, the monument business is booming. "We're up 25-30% depending on product lines; I think all domestic manufacturers are up," said Rob Boulanger, who manages the huge Rock of Ages plant. "People are pre-buying, so people are looking at their mortality, right? And wanting to take care of those final arrangements before something happens."Teichner asked, "Has COVID influenced that?""Oh, absolutely."The longing to remember – and be remembered – a catalyst. "I think that if we don't manage to properly memorialize those that have been lost in this pandemic, it says that people like my dad, his life, didn't matter," said Kristin Urquiza. She never got to say goodbye to her father, Mark Urquiza, who died on June 30, 2020, isolated, on a ventilator, in an Arizona hospital. It was pre-vaccine. Cases were rising, but Arizona had opened back up."Sure, maybe he should have said no to coming together with his friends to celebrate the 'end' of the pandemic," Urquiza said. "He was given false information upon which he made choices, and that cost him his life." Urquiza founded a non-profit, Marked by COVID, advocating for permanent memorials and a CVOD Memorial Day. In Congress there's been limited support. She said, "Our elected officials would much rather move on, and I'm here to say we're not going to let you."Barry said, "I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't really many memorials.""But a million dead? Are they invisible?" Teichner asked. "Well, which party is gonna take credit for that, you know?" he laughed. "There's been an effort to create a COVID commission, like the 9/11 commission, which, unfortunately, nobody seems eager to accept."For Barry, the 1918 flu should be justification enough – proof of the cost in human lives of forgetting. "There will be another pandemic," he said. "If we allow the lessons that could be learned from this not to be learned, then we are really fools."

(Bonnie French/Facebook)Social SharingThough cases of avian flu are being reported across Atlantic Canada, it's not responsible for the deaths of more than 100 hundred eider ducks found on Grand Manan in February.The Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative confirmed none of the eider duck samples taken from Grand Manan tested positive for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, which has recently been detected in all of the Atlantic Canadian provinces.CBC reached out to Environment and Climate Change Canada, the department responsible for investigating the ducks' deaths, to ask if a cause of death had been determined, or if there were any updates on the investigation.Grand Manan woman makes gruesome discovery while walking beach at low tideMore dead ducks wash up on Grand Manan shoreThe Department of Fisheries and Oceans returned to Seal Cove on southern Grand Manan twice in February. A woman's discovery of 32 dead ducks there brought the department's first visit on Feb. 2. It returned a week later, following the discovery of an additional 100 dead ducks. Department staff took the remains, some of which had been stored in a resident's freezer, back with them for Environment and Climate Change Canada to investigate.The organization told CBC News in February that three of the birds were banded; two in Quebec and one in Newfoundland and Labrador, in 2016, 2017, and 2009 respectively.

Environment and Climate Change Canada also said there are a number of potential causes of a large winter mortality event for eiders, including starvation, disease, severe weather, and environmental toxins.Eider ducks are common in the Bay of Fundy.Quispamsis birder Jim Wilson told CBC News last month they're long-lived, sturdy birds that are well-equipped to withstand cold weather. "All these sea ducks are probably 20, 30 years, maybe even longer of age.

By Chuck Abbott Chuck Abbott The slow-talking son of an Illinois farm family, Chuck Abbott covered U.S. food and agriculture policy in its many forms since 1988, from farm bills (six so far) and crop insurance reform to school lunch, ag research, biofuels and the Dietary Guidelines. Editor of the daily electronic newsletter Ag Insider published by the Food and Environment Reporting Network and contributor to agriculture.com. Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on March 7, 2022 Close Photo: roibu of iStockphoto.com Highly pathogenic avian influenza was identified in three more states — Missouri, Maryland, and South Dakota — said the Agriculture Department. Since the first case was confirmed on February 8 on a turkey farm in southern Indiana, HPAI has been found in 21 domestic flocks in 12 states. Nearly 1.9 million birds, mostly chickens and turkeys, have died, either from the disease or from exterminations intended to prevent the spread of it. Agricultural officials act quickly and ruthlessly because "high path" bird flu can wipe out a flock swiftly. This year's outbreaks are the first appearance of HPAI in domestic flocks in two years. More than 50 million chickens and turkeys died in an HPAI epidemic that ran from December 2014 through June 2015. "These birds accounted for about 12% of the U.S. table-egg laying population and 8% of the estimated inventory of turkeys grown for meat," said a 2017 USDA report. "In response to this historic animal-disease event, many destination markets for U.S. poultry commodities levied trade restrictions on U.S. poultry exports, distorting markets and exacerbating economic losses." Over the weekend, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed HPAI in a flock of 240,000 broiler chickens, being raised for human consumption, in Stoddard County in southeastern Missouri; in a flock of egg-laying hens in Cecil County, in the northeastern corner of Maryland; and in a "commercial mixed species flock" in Charles Mix County in southeastern South Dakota. The agency did not say how large the flocks were in Maryland and South Dakota. The largest loss so far was 1.2 million "commercial poultry" in New Castle County in northern Delaware. New Castle County adjoins Cecil County, Maryland. Federal and state surveillance and testing of birds was stepped up after the Delaware outbreak on February 22 to protect the poultry industry on the Delmarva Peninsula, said the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA). "All poultry growers, operators, and owners, including those who manage backyard flocks, must remain vigilant," said Maryland agriculture secretary Joe Bartenfelder. "MDA, USDA and other partner agencies are working diligently to address and localize the situation, including quarantining and testing nearby flocks." The infected farm was put in quarantine and the flock will be culled. The Missouri and South Dakota outbreaks were the second and third west of the Mississippi River; the first was on March 1 in a backyard flock in Pottawattamie County in western Iowa. To date, Indiana has the largest number of outbreaks — six flocks in Dubois and Greene counties. Avian influenza is highly contagious and can be spread by migratory waterfowl and their droppings, but also through contact with infected poultry and by contaminated equipment and clothing of farmworkers. Wild birds are seemingly unaffected by HPAI. The virus is not considered a health risk for humans. More than 300 cases of HPAI in wild birds have been confirmed by the USDA this year.

Full coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicPut more bluntly, the flu vaccine was “essentially ineffective,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.Indeed, research from earlier in the flu season found that the vaccine was a poor match for the H3N2 strain of the virus. That study, from researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, was posted as a pre-print, meaning it had not been peer-reviewed.Thursday's CDC report confirmed that the dominant strain detected this season was H3N2 — a strain that flu experts say is particularly troublesome, as it tends to mutate faster than other variants of influenza and traditionally leads to more hospitalizations and deaths.The findings come amid the nation's second flu season in a row with low flu activity overall. Flu cases did start to rise in the fall, sparking fears of a "twindemic" of Covid-19 and the flu, but cases never took off like they do in typical flu seasons.Some flu experts had been particularly concerned that the nation could have a bad flu season this year after flu cases reached an all-time low last year, when most parts of the country were shut down because of the pandemic. Schaffner said that it's possible the omicron surge in December and January had an impact on keeping flu cases at bay, by causing people to wear masks again, practice social distancing and other mitigation measures. Those measures likely kept flu levels low in the 2020-2021 season as well.Still, Schaffner said, the CDC's new report underscores the need for a better flu vaccine, because "the flu is not going away. ... It will be back again next year and the year after that and the year after that." Flu vaccines generally reduce the risk of illness from influenza viruses by between 40 percent and 60 percent, according to the CDC. Vaccine makers, including Pfizer and Moderna, are developing potential flu shots that use mRNA technology, the same platform used to create the Covid-19 vaccine, though those vaccines, if found to be effective, will likely not be available until late 2023. The CDC recommends everyone over the age of 6 months get the flu vaccine because the shots can prevent more serious outcomes from influenza, such as severe disease, hospitalization and death.Thursday's report noted that compared to the 2020-21 flu season, vaccination coverage this year was lower in certain groups, including pregnant women, infants and preschool-age children.Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.Berkeley Lovelace Jr.Berkeley Lovelace Jr. is a health and medical reporter for NBC News.

Editor of the daily electronic newsletter Ag Insider published by the Food and Environment Reporting Network and contributor to agriculture.com. Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on March 8, 2022 Close With new outbreaks in Iowa and Missouri, nearly 2.8 million birds — almost entirely chickens and turkeys — have died in one month due to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the Agriculture Department said on Monday. The viral disease has been identified in 23 poultry farms and backyard flocks in a dozen states since February 8, when the first report of "high path" bird flu in a domestic flock was reported. READ MORE: How to control the avian flu outbreak HPAI was confirmed over the weekend on a turkey farm with 50,000 birds in Buena Vista County in northwestern Iowa and in a backyard mixed-species flock of 43 birds in Bates County in western Missouri, about 50 miles south of Kansas City. Those discoveries followed the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's confirmation of HPAI in a flock of 664,061 laying hens in Cecil County, in the northeast corner of Maryland, and in 360,000 broiler chickens in Stoddard County, in southeastern Missouri. More than 50 million chickens and turkeys died in an HPAI epidemic that ran from December 2014 through June 2015, driving up egg prices and leaving some grocery stores short of eggs. The outbreak also triggered import bans by some countries against U.S. poultry meat; 16% of U.S. poultry meat is exported. The USDA list of HPAI outbreaks is available here. Was this page helpful?

This manual provides guidance in preventing the entry of Avian Influenza (AI) in the Philippines, as well as disease response measures in the event of an incursion. This document also includes changes in the definition of terms and the section on the recognition of AI-Free compartments or regions, as well the revisions in the coverage of quarantine and surveillance zones in case of a local detection of AI. General Information: The 3rd Edition of the Philippine Department of Agriculture's Avian Influenza Protection Program Manual of Procedure (AIPP-MOP) was finalized in 2020. See here for the complete AIPP-MOP text. This Manual, which references the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, provides guidance in preventing the entry of Avian Influenza (AI) in the Philippines, as well as states the disease response measures to be implemented in the event of an incursion. It also includes changes in the definition of terms, updates in the section on the recognition of AI-Free compartments or regions, as well revisions in the coverage of quarantine and surveillance zones in case of a local detection of AI. Stage 1 focuses on preventing the entry of AI into the country. This section covers the regulatory protocols to prevent disease incursions from other countries (page 10). The prevention plans include bans on the importation of live poultry and their products from AI-affected countries or zones. It allows the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) to immediately suspend processing and issuance of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Import Clearances (SPSICs) from a country or zone declared as AI-affected. However, if the live poultry or poultry products come from a country with AI-affected zone/s, a risk analysis will first be carried out by the BAI. The AIPP-MOP recognizes the establishment of AI-Free Compartments or Zones (page 9). This section includes the criteria used for the establishment and Continue after advertising.

Agencia de Marketing GanaderoFlu down for second year; reason may be as plain as the mask on your face HOME NEWS Decision 2024 Law & Government Abortion Policy Education Benson’s Corner Commentary ABOUT SUBSCRIBE DONATE Part of States Newsroom Decision 2024 Law & Government Abortion Policy Education Benson’s Corner 9:55 Brief ArizonaCOVID-19Health A to Z Flu down for second year; reason may be as plain as the mask on your face By: Alexia Stanbridge/Cronkite News - March 11, 2022 9:55 am Photo credit iStock / Getty Images Plus WASHINGTON – Arizona flu cases are down sharply for the second year in a row, a decline that health experts are attributing to the health and safety precautions that came with the COVID-19 pandemic. By the first week in March, the Arizona Department of Health Services had reported 6,591 confirmed flu cases in the state, less than 40% of the 16,849 cases that would have been reported at this point in the season, based on a five-year average. While they cannot say for sure what is behind the drop, experts have a pretty good idea. To them, it’s as plain as the mask on your face. GET THE MORNING HEADLINES. SUBSCRIBE “The obvious answer is because of mitigation factors, the same thing that prevent you from getting COVID prevent you from getting the flu,” said Frank LoVecchio, clinical professor and medical director of clinical research at Arizona State University’s College of Health Solutions. “If you look at the average numbers of flu cases over the past five years or so, this year has been relatively mild, we’ve had less numbers, less cases of the flu this year,” LoVecchio said. But the drop in flu cases cannot be attributed solely to the flu vaccine, he said, since flu vaccination rates this year are not significantly higher than in previous years. LoVecchio said that points to COVID-19 safety protocols as the reason. Will Humble, the executive director for the Arizona Public Health Association, agreed. “We definitely know that wearing a face covering in public, a mask in public, really helps slow the spread of COVID-19. But it even works better on influenza,” Humble said. The numbers are up sharply from last year, but that’s only because flu cases in the 2020-21 flu season were “practically nonexistent,” Humble said. By this time last year, there were just 866 confirmed flu cases in the state, a little more than 4% of the cases that would have been reported by March in a typical year to that point. Experts also think they know why numbers have surged, relatively speaking, from last year to this year. LoVecchio said that people last year were generally more worried about COVID and mitigation efforts were stricter. This year, not so much. “A lot of people are getting what we like to call pandemic fatigue,” he said. “We’re getting tired of this, tired of staying … indoors or tired of wearing masks, etc. And that’s why things loosened up.” But those people who are still strict about their COVID-19 protections are likely to remain flu-safe, too, said Dave Voepel, CEO of the Arizona Health Care Association. He said that because older adults are wearing masks, for example, members of his association are seeing fewer flu cases in their skilled nursing facilities and assisted living centers. “The last couple of years have been pretty much a good flu season, if there is such a thing,” Voepel said. “You know, if you get the flu, you’re going to be down and out.” Both Voepel and LoVecchio said that flu coverage took a “backseat to COVID” in the media in recent years. But while COVID-19 got the attention it deserves, LoVecchio said, it would be a mistake to overlook the flu in the long term. Experts said it’s important to remember that the flu is still dangerous and is still a significant cause of death in the country. It had already killed 22 people in Arizona by early March – and that is in a mild year. The 2019-2020 flu season killed 160 people in Arizona, with 109 of those deaths coming by the first week of March. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that in the 2019-2020 season nationwide, “influenza was associated with 38 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 405,000 hospitalizations, and 22,000 deaths.” “Many of us on the frontlines have not forgotten about the flu. It is something that we can do something about, we have some medications for that,” LoVecchio said. And experts said that people are going to have to learn to live with both illnesses. COVID-19 is likely never going away, LoVecchio said, in the “same way the flu is never going away.” While this flu season is not gone, Humble said it is “waning out.” “It looks like we’re past the peak of transmission of influenza,” he said. “Very seldom do we see a two-peak season; it’s extremely rare.” YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE. SUPPORT XFlu down for second year; reason may be as plain as the mask on your face by Alexia Stanbridge/Cronkite News, Arizona Mirror March 11, 2022 Flu down for second year; reason may be as plain as the mask on your face by Alexia Stanbridge/Cronkite News, Arizona Mirror March 11, 2022 WASHINGTON – Arizona flu cases are down sharply for the second year in a row, a decline that health experts are attributing to the health and safety precautions that came with the COVID-19 pandemic. By the first week in March, the Arizona Department of Health Services had reported 6,591 confirmed flu cases in the state, less than 40% of the 16,849 cases that would have been reported at this point in the season, based on a five-year average. While they cannot say for sure what is behind the drop, experts have a pretty good idea. To them, it’s as plain as the mask on your face. GET THE MORNING HEADLINES. SUBSCRIBE “The obvious answer is because of mitigation factors, the same thing that prevent you from getting COVID prevent you from getting the flu,” said Frank LoVecchio, clinical professor and medical director of clinical research at Arizona State University’s College of Health Solutions. “If you look at the average numbers of flu cases over the past five years or so, this year has been relatively mild, we’ve had less numbers, less cases of the flu this year,” LoVecchio said. But the drop in flu cases cannot be attributed solely to the flu vaccine, he said, since flu vaccination rates this year are not significantly higher than in previous years. LoVecchio said that points to COVID-19 safety protocols as the reason. Will Humble, the executive director for the Arizona Public Health Association, agreed. “We definitely know that wearing a face covering in public, a mask in public, really helps slow the spread of COVID-19. But it even works better on influenza,” Humble said. The numbers are up sharply from last year, but that’s only because flu cases in the 2020-21 flu season were “practically nonexistent,” Humble said.

The Ministry of Health has reported that a number of ILI and SARI cases were positive for Influenza. The Ministry of Health is deploying an influenza vaccine for high risk groups such children, pregnant women, and older citizens etc. meanwhile Tamiflu - antiviral treatment is available to all health facilities at all levels. The Ministry advises the public to continue with influenza hygiene which is similar to COVID-19. (source), 2. Actual increases in the number of ILI cases is seen in Fiji and Tonga. A reduction of ILI cases were seen in RMI, Kiribati, Solomon Islands and New Caledonia for the week. The decrease seen in FSM may be due to the decreased number of sites reported for the week. Nil ILI cases were reported for the week from the Niue, Cook Islands, Palau, and Pitcairn Islands. No reports were available from French Polynesia, Tuvalu, Tokelau, Wallis & Futuna, Vanuatu, CNMI, and Samoa for the week. American Samoa, Guam and Nauru have not participated in the surveillance. Surveillance figures are not intended to capture all country cases but to describe trends over time and are invaluable when trends rise beyond country baselines which should then trigger alerts and timely actions to characterize the actual nature and magnitude of the disease.

A good forecasting method of infectious diseases should have the advantages of interpretability, feasibility, and forecasting performance. Since previous research had illustrated that the spatial transmission network (STN) showed good interpretability and feasibility, this study further explored its forecasting performance for infectious diseases across multiple regions. Meanwhile, this study also showed whether the STN could overcome the challenges of model rationality and practical needs. Methods: The construction of the STN framework involved three major steps: the spatial kluster analysis by tree edge removal (SKATER) algorithm, structure learning by dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), and parameter learning by the vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) model. Then, we evaluated the forecasting performance of STN by comparing its accuracy with that of the mechanism models like susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SEIRS) and machine-learning algorithm like long-short-term memory (LSTM). At the same time, we assessed the robustness of forecasting performance of STN in high and low incidence seasons. The influenza-like illness (ILI) data in the Sichuan Province of China from 2010 to 2017 were used as an example for illustration. Results: The STN model revealed that ILI was likely to spread among multiple cities in Sichuan during the study period. During the whole study period, the forecasting accuracy of the STN (mean absolute percentage error [MAPE] = 31.134) was significantly better than that of the LSTM (MAPE = 41.657) and the SEIRS (MAPE = 62.039). In addition, the forecasting performance of STN was also superior to those of the other two methods in either the high incidence season (MAPE = 24.742) or the low incidence season (MAPE = 26.209), and the superiority was more obvious in the high incidence season. Conclusion: This study applied the STN to the forecast of infectious diseases across multiple regions. The results illustrated that the STN not only had good accuracy in forecasting performance but also indicated the spreading directions of infectious diseases among multiple regions to a certain extent. Therefore, the STN is a promising candidate to improve the surveillance work. Introduction The outbreak of infectious diseases poses a serious threat to public health and imposes a heavy burden on the global economy. According to recent research studies, there were around 291,000–646,000 deaths caused by seasonal influenza-related respiratory illnesses worldwide every year (1, 2). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that from October 1, 2019 to April 4, 2020, there were 39,000,000–56,000,000 flu infections and 24,000–62,000 flu deaths in the US (3). In addition, the WHO assessed that the first influenza pandemic in this century damaged the global economy by around $800 billion (4). In view of the severe threats of infectious diseases, consistently improving the infectious disease surveillance work is the top priority for health promotion (5). How to utilize the surveillance data to achieve accurate and reliable forecasting in the early stage of infectious diseases is an important basis for formulating corresponding prevention and control strategies, so it has attracted the attention of a large number of researchers. Specifically, good forecasting for infectious diseases requires three main properties: (1) interpretability, that is, the model reflects the epidemic features of infectious diseases in order to guarantee the forecasted results to make sense in practice, (2) feasibility, which involves the support of statistical software (such as SPSS, SAS, and R), the availability of data, and the needs from disease surveillance, etc., and (3) forecasting performance, the inherent ability of the model to accurately forecast the future epidemics of infectious diseases, so as to help propose precise prevention and control measures and to allocate limited resources in the most needed places. To this end, previous research proposed the spatial transmission network (STN) and showed its good interpretability and feasibility for the transmission mechanism of diseases (6). However, the last but most important work of forecasting performance assessment was left to be done. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to further explore the forecasting performance of the STN for infectious diseases across multiple regions. However, there were two major challenges when exploring the forecasting performance of STN. The first challenge was related to the rationality of the model. The STN model essentially involved spatial clustering analysis, structure learning, and parameter learning, where the vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) model was adopted for parameter learning. Although it seemed natural to apply the VARMA model to forecasting, the rationality remained quite unclear in the spatio-temporal settings, especially when compared with mechanism models (7, 8) and machine learning methods (9). For example, as classic representatives of mechanism models, the compartmental models, such as susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) (10, 11), susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) (12), and susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SEIRS) (13), have been widely applied in the field of influenza prediction. Meanwhile, the machine learning methods are also playing more and more important roles in infectious disease forecasting. Svitlana et al. established and evaluated the capability of long-short term memory (LSTM) for nowcasting (predicting in “real time”) and forecasting (predicting the future) of influenza-like illness (ILI) dynamics, which found that the neural network structure that relied on LSTM units outperformed the traditional regression model (14). Therefore, the rationality of the VARMA model in infectious disease forecasting should be qualified by comparing its performance with those of the machine learning models and mechanism models. In addition, the second challenge came from practical needs. To be specific, both spatial and temporal transmission of infectious diseases are influenced by many external factors, such as the effective distance between the cities, population size, and transportation. Previous research showed fantastic applications on how such factors could be used to improve forecasting performance (15). In addition, another inspiring study suggested that, in order to verify the robustness of the model when dealing with seasonal infectious diseases, its forecasting performance should be verified in both high and low incidence seasons (16). All these contributions shed light upon a systematic way to build the forecasting framework based on the STN model. This study will show whether the STN could overcome the above two challenges and contribute to the forecast of infectious diseases across multiple regions. The sentinel surveillance data of ILI in the Sichuan Province of China from 2010 to 2017 was used as an example for illustration. Sichuan is one of the core regions for influenza surveillance in China. The representativeness of these areas not only guaranteed the applicability of this method in these regions but also offered evidence for future application to other regions. Materials and Methods Data Collection and Preparation Ever since the outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, China has established a nationwide ILI sentinel surveillance system, which consists of 193 sentinel hospitals in 30 provinces at present. The identification of patients with ILI is based on the standard case definition of the WHO, that is, body temperature ≥38°C with either cough or sore throat, in the absence of an alternative diagnosis (17). Besides, the ILI% was widely used in influenza surveillance to reflect the local intensity of the influenza epidemic, where ILI% = (the number of ILI cases in outpatient and emergency departments)/(the total number of outpatient and emergency cases) ×100% (18, 19). Taking n places as an example, x1(t), x2(t), ⋯ , xn(t) denoted the ILI% values of the place n at the t-th week. Accordingly, all the observed data at the t-th week could be noted as xt = {x1(t), x2(t), ⋯ , xn(t)}, where xt is a vector with n series components (boldface notation indicated vectors and matrices hereafter). As for this study, the weekly ILI% time series data came from each city of Sichuan Province from 2010 to 2017, so t ranged from 1 to 416. Such sample size was large enough relative to the complexity of the models utilized below, since the maximum degrees of freedom of the STN, LSTM, and SEIRS model employed by this study were no more than 40. In addition, Zhang et al. reported that at least 3 years of weekly historical data were required for VARMA-type models to assure the quality of infectious diseases surveillance (20). Therefore, it was plausible that the sample size in this study could support the model estimation. Furthermore, the application of STN required either each univariate time series to be weak stationary (i.e., the mean and covariance matrices of the time series are independent on time), or the multivariate time series to meet the cointegration condition (i.e., a linear combination of individual unit-root non-stationary time series becomes a stationary series), where the weak stationary and the cointegration conditions could be checked by the unit-root test and cointegration test, respectively (21). If both conditions were violated, one should seek other time series analysis techniques for the solution. For the sake of clarity, this study only focused on situations when both conditions were satisfied, and readers who might be interested in more complicated situations could refer to the works of other researchers (22). The Construction of STN The construction of STN mainly consisted of three steps: spatial clustering analysis, structure learning, and parameter learning. First, due to the heterogeneity of ILI% data in Sichuan Province, the spatial kluster analysis by tree edge removal (SKATER) algorithm was used to divide the whole area into several homogeneous clusters. Second, the structural information of STN (i.e., the existence and direction of disease transmission) among cities in each cluster was identified from the original data through structure learning. Lastly, the parameters of STN that measured the intensity of disease transmission between different cities were estimated by parameter learning. After the construction of STN, the future incidence of infectious diseases could be forecasted. Spatial Clustering Analysis To avoid the curse of dimensionality in modeling and to make the results more interpretable, the SKATER algorithm was used for spatial clustering analysis. This is a graph clustering algorithm based on the minimum spanning tree, which obtains the clustering result that satisfies the spatial adjacency constraint by cutting off the edges of the minimum spanning tree (23). Specifically, after standardizing the ILI%, population density (people per-square kilometer), and the number of domestic tourists (10,000 person-times), the Euclidean distance between the two regions was calculated to obtain the difference matrix. The root adjacency method was used to constrain the adjacency matrix, the minimum clustering area size was set to two regions, and the result of cluster division was finally obtained. The Structure Learning of STN The first-order conditional dependencies approximation for dynamic Bayesian network (G1DBN) was used to build the structure of STN (24). It implemented the structural learning in a two-step way. Specifically, it first learned a directed acyclic graph from the first-order partial dependence relationships among the time series of different regions. Then, it optimized the graph from the first step to infer the network structure of the STN. As a result, the estimated STN structure would include a set of nodes to represent each city and pairs of edges to indicate which cities have an impact on others in influenza transmission (6). The Parameter Learning of STN We used the VARMA model for parameter learning, which was a flexible modeling framework that could comprehensively describe and predict the dynamic relations among each component of multivariate time series (25). Taking the n-dimensional as an example, a general VARMA (p, q) model can be written as: xt=a0+∑i=1paixt-i+εt-∑j=1qbjεt-j. (1) Where, p and q are non-negative integers, a0 is an n-dimensional constant vector, ai and bj are n × n constant matrices, and {εt} is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random vectors. In addition, εt is the white noise sequence and the residual of the model fitting, and ∑j=1qbjεt-j is a moving average (MA) term. The model-fitting step was comprised of order determination and parameter estimation. First, in the part of order selection, the values of p and q in Equation (1) were determined. Tiao and Tsay proposed to use the two-way p-value table for extended cross-correlation matrices to specify the order (p, q) (26). Once the orders were determined, the parameters of the VARMA model could be estimated by the conditional likelihood method. However, the VARMA model may encounter a problem of identifiability, which means that the coefficients may not be uniquely determined. To solve this problem, this study used the Kronecker index approach to perform structural specification of the VARMA model (25). The Forecast of STN We applied the minimum mean-squared error criterion for the forecasts of the VARMA (p, q) time series xt. For VARMA (p, q) model, the l-step ahead forecast of xt+l at the forecast origin t is: xt(l)=E(xt+l|Ft)=a0+∑i=1paiXt(l-i). (2) A more convenient expression based on MA appears as: xt(l)=E(xt+l|Ft)=∑k=0∞ψl+kεt-k. (3) The prediction of the minimum mean-squared error of xt+l is the conditional expectation of xt+l at a given Ft. We denote Ft and the information available at t and ψl as the coefficient matrices. The l-step ahead forecast error is Equation (4). Consequently, the covariance matrix of l-step ahead forecast error is Equation (5): et(l)=εt+l+∑k=1l-1ψkεt+l-k, (4) Cov[et(l)]=∑ε+∑k=1t-1ψk∑εψkT, (5) where Equation (4) shows that the forecast error tends to the random part of xt as l increases. When l approaches 0, xt(l) tends to E(xt). Besides, Equation (5) shows that, as l approaches infinity, Cov[et(l)] converges to Cov(xt). As the time lag increases, the dynamic dependence of the stationary reversible VARMA model decays exponentially to 0. Equation (5) also provides an effective method for calculating the covariance matrix of the forecast error. The Comparison Models Since it has been already reported that the forecasting performance of the VARMA model was superior to that of the univariate time series model (27), this study chose another two mainstream methods, SEIRS and LSTM, as comparison models. The two methods respectively represented the mechanism models and machine learning methods, which could serve as benchmarks for forecasting performance comparison. The SEIRS Model The SEIRS model, as a type of mechanism model, has four groups: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R), with the total population size N = S+E+I+R. For ILI, the immunity of individuals after recovery is only temporary, and there is still the possibility of reinfection. We emphasized that both infected persons and exposed persons who may be in the incubation period were infectious. Meanwhile, this study did not consider dramatic population changes during only a few years. Therefore, the SEIRS model was adopted in this study to describe the transmission of ILI. The specific equation of the SEIRS model adopted was as follows: {dSdt=−rβISN−r2β2ESN+λRdEdt=rβISN−αE+r2β2ESNdIdt=αE−γIdRdt=γI−λR (6) In Equation (6), the N represents the total number of people in the region. S, E, I, and R denote susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered group, respectively. For each unknown parameter, β is the probability of the infected person transmitting the virus to the susceptible person, β2 is the probability of the exposed person transmitting the virus to the susceptible person, r denotes the average number of susceptible persons in contact with infected persons, r2 denotes the average number of susceptible persons in contact with exposed persons, α represents the probability of the exposed person becoming infected, γ represents the probability of the infected person recovering to health, and λ indicates the probability of the recovered person returning to a susceptible state. The optimal estimates of these parameters were estimated by the historical ILI% data of each city based on the minimum fitted error. The LSTM Method The LSTM neural network is an improved algorithm based on the recurrent neural network (RNN). By adding a “gate” structure, it overcomes the shortcomings of RNN and avoids the vanishing gradient problem. “Gate” structure can selectively forget or memorize information, including the existence of a sigmoid activation function. A LSTM unit contains three gates: forgetting gate, input gate, and output gate, which makes the invariable self-cycling weight matrix in RNN change. These changed weights are adjusted continuously according to the learning process, so as to solve the problem of gradient disappearance. Performance Validation The performance validation step included residual checking and performance comparison. For the residual checking part, since a well-behaved VARMA model should ideally extract all the regular pattern information out of the original data, the residuals of the model were white noise (i.e., the data should be completely random series without any regular pattern information). Therefore, the Ljung-Box statistics was utilized in this study to verify the model by testing whether residuals of the model were only white noises. As for the performance comparison part, we compared the results of the STN with those of the other two types of models. To this end, the accuracy of the methods was measured. The accuracy evaluated whether the forecasted values of the ILI% were close to the real ones. In this study, considering that the value of ILI% was decimal, the relative measurement index would be appropriate to distinguish the difference of forecasting performance of the models, so we adopted mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to monitor the accuracy. In addition, to assess the forecasting performance of the model, the whole time series data was split into the training set and the testing set. We used the first set for the test of model fitting and the second one for forecasting. For the overall performance, the training set integrated the data from the 1st week of 2010 to the 26th week of 2017, while the testing set data consisted of data from the second-half year of 2017. Furthermore, we also tried several different dataset splitting methods (see Section Seasonal Forecast) to evaluate the seasonal forecasting performance. Seasonal Forecast Influenza has the characteristic of seasonal epidemics, and the high incidence season of disease epidemics is from November to March of the next year. In order to study whether there was a difference in the forecasting performance of STN in the high incidence season and the low incidence season of the disease, and the robustness of the forecasting performance of STN, the last high incidence season (data integrated from the 44th week of 2016 to the 13th week of 2017) and the last low incidence season (data integrated from the 14th week of 2017 to the 43rd week of 2017) were specifically divided from the original data set for forecasting verification. The forecasting performances of the STN and the other two models were compared in the high and low incidence seasons of ILI. All the above statistical tests were conducted at the statistically significant level of 0.05. The SKATER was performed in GeoDa 1.18.0.0. SEIRS model and LSTM model were performed in MATLAB R2021a. The rest of the statistical analyses were performed in R 4.0.1 using the computing packages {MTS} for the VARMA model and {G1DBN} for DBN. Results Cluster Partitioning The grouping of eight clusters based on the SKATER algorithm is shown in Figure 1. However, this study did not include the clusters where these cities may contain outliers. Therefore, 14 cities in Sichuan Province were included, which were divided into 5 clusters (i.e., cluster 1: Aba, Mianyang, Ganzi, and Ya'an; cluster 2: Guang'an, Suining, and Ziyang; cluster 3: Yibin, Luzhou, and Neijiang; cluster 4: Chengdu and Deyang; cluster 5: Meishan and Zigong). FIGURE 1 Figure 1. The cluster results of spatial kluster analysis by tree edge removal (SKATER) algorithm. Data Preparation and Description The ILI% series of actual values of the 14 cities in Sichuan could be seen from Figure 3 and Supplementary Figures 1–4. In most time series, stationarity could be visually verified since there was no dramatic change. Furthermore, except for Chengdu, Suining, and Ziyang, the unit-root test showed that the values of P of other cities were less than 0.05, which further confirmed that the time series were stationary. For Chengdu, Suining, and Ziyang, cointegration tests were performed on ILI% time series vectors of all cities in their clusters (i.e., clusters 2 and 4). The results were significant, indicating that there were both cointegrations among ILI% sequences of cities in these two clusters. Besides, from the cross-correlation plots shown in Figures 2A–F and Supplementary Figures 5–8, the existence of dynamic correlations among the ILI% time series had been verified. Therefore, it was appropriate to use the VARMA model for further analysis. FIGURE 2 Figure 2. The cross-correlation of ILI% between cities of cluster 1. (A) Aba and Mianyang. (B) Aba and Ganzi. (C) Aba and Ya'an. (D) Mianyang and Ganzi. (E) Mianyang and Ya'an. (F) Ganzi and Ya'an. Estimates of the VARMA Model In this study, we estimated the VARMA model for 1–390 weeks. The best model for each cluster is listed in Table 1. TABLE 1 Table 1. The best vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) model for each cluster. Performance Validation It could be seen from Figure 3 and Supplementary Figures 1–4 that both the fitted values and forecasted values approximated very well to the actual ones. In addition, the forecasting part also exhibited that the 95% CI of forecasted values could basically contain the actual values, which suggested the STN was also good at precision. More details about the residual checking and model comparison are given below. FIGURE 3 Figure 3. The fitted/forecasted time series vs. the actual values for cities of cluster 1. (A) Aba. (B) Mianyang. (C) Ganzi. (D) Ya'an. Residual Checking For cluster 1, the Q statistics for 1-, 5-, 10-, and 20-lag Ljung-Box tests were 0.56 (df = 16, P = 1.00), 45.84 (df = 80, P = 1.00), 136.76 (df = 160, P = 0.91), and 294.01 (df = 320, P = 0.85), respectively, which validated that the VARMA model had fully extracted the useful information out of the original data and that the left residuals were only white noise series. Meanwhile, compared with Figures 2A–F, 4 displays that the information of cross-correlation between dynamic time series of cluster 1 has been fully extracted by the VARMA model. The other clusters had similar results. More details are given in Supplementary Figures 9–12. FIGURE 4 Figure 4. The cross-correlation of the residuals between cities of cluster 1.

The average MAPE of the 14 cites of STN was 31.134, which was 25.26 and 49.82% less than that of the LSTM and SEIRS respectively. At the city level, the MAPE of STN was almost the smallest among the three models, with only a few exceptions. For example, the forecasting accuracy of STN was not the best among the three models in the three cities in cluster 2, which might be affected by the instability of the original data series of Suining and Ziyang. Although there was a cointegration relationship between the three sequences in this cluster, the instability of the sequence still affected the forecasting performance of the STN model. In addition, for the forecasting of Luzhou, SEIRS performed slightly better than STN, which might be influenced by the geographical location of Luzhou. As Luzhou is located at the intersection of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Chongqing, its epidemic situation is likely to be affected by other cities outside the province, which was out the scope of this study since it only built networks within Sichuan Province. However, even in this case, the forecasting performance of the other two cities in cluster 3 was still good. As for Ganzi, it could be seen from Figure 3 that ILI% remains at a low level from 2010 to 2015, and the incidence of ILI in some weeks was reported to be zero. Except for the above plausible exceptions, the accuracy of STN forecasting was generally better than that of the SEIRS and LSTM models. TABLE 2 Table 2. The comparison of the forecasting mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the three methods. The Results of the Seasonal Forecast The Forecast of High Incidence Season The training set and testing set were redivided, and the forecast analysis of high incidence season used data integrated from the 1st week of 2010 to the 43rd week of 2016 as the training set, data integrated from the 44th week of 2016 to the 13th week of 2017 as the testing set. Table 3 lists the comparison of MAPE values of the three models in forecast analysis in high incidence season. According to the mean MAPE of the 14 cities, the forecasting accuracy advantage of STN was more obvious than that of LSTM and SEIRS. The MAPE value of STN decreased to 24.742 when compared with that before the seasonal division of the forecast set, and the MAPE value of LSTM reached about three times that of STN. For each city except Zigong, the accuracy of STN forecasting of the other cities was better than that of the other two models. In Zigong, the forecasting accuracy of LSTM was slightly better than that of STN. However, it did not affect the overall assessment of performance since the MAPE in Zigong was already very low and the difference between STN and LSTM was even lower. TABLE 3 Table 3. The comparison of the forecasting MAPE in the high incidence season of the three methods. The Forecast of Low Incidence Season In the forecasting analysis of low incidence season, we included the data integrated from the 1st week of 2010 to the 13th week of 2017 as the training set, and the data integrated from the 14th week of 2017 to the 43rd week of 2017 as the testing set. Table 4 lists the comparison of MAPE values of the three models in the forecasting analysis of low incidence season. According to the mean MAPE of the 14 cities, the forecasting MAPE of STN decreased to 26.209 when compared with that before the seasonal division of the forecast set and was still better than that of LSTM and SEIRS. At the city level, the accuracy of STN was better than that of the other two models for most cities excluding Mianyang, Ganzi, and Ziyang. The low accuracy of STN forecasting in Ganzi and Ziyang might be owed to the reasons mentioned in Section Performance comparisons, and the accuracy of Ganzi affected that of Mianyang since they were in the same cluster. TABLE 4 Table 4. The comparison of the forecasting MAPE in the low incidence season of the three methods. In general, the accuracy of STN forecasting in both high and low incidence seasons was the best among the three models, and the MAPE value of STN decreased significantly when compared with the forecast set which was not divided according to the seasonality of influenza. To be more specific, the numbers of regions with the best accuracy of STN forecasting in high incidence season and low incidence season increased, especially in high incidence season. This showed that STN had good forecasting performance and strong robustness in both high and low incidence seasons. Furthermore, STN had better forecasting accuracy either in the high or low incidence season, but it was more suitable in the high incidence season. Discussion The results of this study illustrated that the STN had advantages in forecasting performance of infectious diseases across multiple regions. The accuracy of its forecasting performance was superior to SEIRS and LSTM. Combined with previous research results (6), it could be seen that the STN would be very helpful in guiding the practical prevention and control work of infectious diseases. According to Stoto (28), a practical surveillance system should include three parts: continuous monitoring of multivariate data, applying algorithms to raise the alarm when something unusual is happening, and a protocol on how to respond to an alarm. It was observed from our results that the STN could assist to improve all three parts of the surveillance system. First, as a multivariate time series analysis model, the STN model could inherently integrate and extract information from multivariate data, which could not only be limited to a single variable (e.g., ILI%) across regions but could also contain other types of variables (e.g., meteorological, social-economic, and environmental factors). The second advantage of STN was that its results could suggest when and where the next outbreak would probably occur and how serious the next outbreak would be, so that it could provide suggestions and evidence on whether an alarm should be raised. Last but not least, the information of direction and time-lag of influenza transmission exhibited by STN could also indicate the way about how to respond to an alarm. For example, this study found that there was a 1-week lagging transmission route from Yibin to Luzhou (the estimated effect was 0.248), which suggested that Luzhou should pay attention to the epidemic situation of Yibin. The same suggestion was also applicable to Yibin, where there was a 2-week lagging transmission route from Neijiang to Yibin (the estimated effect was 0.014). Furthermore, the lag effect as long as 2 weeks also reminded that the surveillance of influenza should maintain a long enough temporal window for early warning. Since the interpretation of the STN model and its potential application were highly consistent with the establishment of a multi-point trigger and a multi-channel surveillance mechanism of infectious diseases (29), it was expected that the STN model could probably serve as a new tool for the improvement of intelligent early warning of infectious diseases. Except for the interpretation of results, there were still other features that could also guarantee the potential use of STN in the practice of influenza surveillance. First, the VARMA model could provide evidence of both strengths of association and temporality, which were the two key points of the Hill's criteria for causality (30). Meanwhile, under some mild conditions, the probability distribution of the VARMA model could be reliably represented as a causal network, and the latter was a commonly used tool in causal inference (24). To this end, it was plausible that the STN could at least partly serve for the etiological study to screen crucial clues of the cause-and-effect relationships. Secondly, from the perspective of representativeness, China is a large country with great diversities among different areas in many aspects (e.g., environment, population, economy, and social customs), and Sichuan Province has the fourth largest population, the fifth largest land, and the sixth highest GDP in China. Besides, the population in Sichuan province includes 55 of China's 56 ethnic groups, and there are many major types of landforms in Sichuan (e.g., mountains, hills, plateaus, and plains). Therefore, the application of STN to the surveillance of influenza in Sichuan province suggested that it could also be considered for infectious diseases surveillance in other areas. However, it should also be acknowledged that there were still some limits in our study. For example, this study provided our explanations based on the features of our analyzed results and some practical experience, so relevant etiological and laboratory data were still in need to further identify the speculations about the spreading direction of influenza in the Sichuan province. Besides, there was a long way to go from model building to making causal inferences about influenza epidemics in the real world. Therefore, it was highly expected that the STN could provide a new way for causal inference in the surveillance of infectious diseases. Conclusion This study applied the STN to forecasting infectious diseases across multiple regions. The results illustrated that the STN not only had good accuracy in forecasting performance but could also indicate the spreading directions of infectious diseases among multiple regions to a certain extent. Therefore, the STN was a promising candidate to improve the surveillance work.

They also explain that health facilities experience as much as a 25 per cent increase in the number of patient visits whenever the weather season changes in the country. While Covid-19 numbers are receding, seasonal flu seems to be affecting the population. Dr Shyam Rajamohan, Specialist Internal Medicine Prime Hospital, said, "The number of patients coming to the clinic with flu-like symptoms has increased in recent weeks." "Flu can sometimes be dangerous to high-risk people like elderly people with chronic diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart diseases, chronic lung, liver, kidney diseases. Hence, it is extremely important to take the flu vaccine yearly to prevent influenza and complications of influenza. But the total number of Covid-19 cases in the UAE has decreased significantly. However, the number of flu cases can be expected to go up if the use of masks reduces." "There has always been an increase in the number of patient visits in the clinic every time there's a shift in the weather. This is a regular occurrence every year. Health facilities experience as much as a 25 per cent increase in the number of patient visits whenever the season changes. Aside from maintaining a healthy lifestyle, we doctors encourage our patients to go for their influenza vaccination during the flu season," points out Dr Daffodils Guevarra, General Practitioner, Prime Medical Center – Deira. Elaborating on the causes that affect the human body adversely, Dr Sherif Fayed Consultant Pulmonologist, Al Zahra Hospital Dubai underlines, "With the changing temperature people are falling sick with flu like symptoms as the season changes from winter to summer. This is also happening as the weather outside is hot and people step out from the indoors where there is air conditioning to an outside temperature which is quite hot." "Another scenario is when people exercise outside, and they sweat and then immediately after they go inside into the AC. This can lead to drop in immunity levels. It happens more during winter season as compared to the summer season."

Doctors advise boosting one's immunity by consuming healthy foods and maintaining a disciplined lifestyle. People should consume vitamin C rich fruits. Additionally, hydrating could help the cause while avoiding sudden changes in temperatures by walking in and out of extreme temperatures. "Just wait a few minutes at the door allowing your body to get acclimatized to the change in temperature," adds Fayed. They further explain that every flu season is different and can affect people in many ways. Dr Syed Nadir, Medical Director & Head of Medical Department, Adam Vital Hospital said, "Millions of people get flu every year, hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized and thousands to tens of thousands of people die from flu-related causes every year. Flu can mean a few days of feeling bad and missing work, or it can result in more serious illness. Flu might also result in bacterial pneumonia ear infections and worsening of chronic medical conditions." Healthcare professionals further say September and October are good times to be vaccinated against flu. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. However, if individuals cannot get vaccinated until November or later, vaccination is still recommended. For those wanting to be vaccinated for both Covid-19 and influenza, healthcare professionals recommend a gap of at least two weeks in between vaccinations. Dr Nadir further says, "One of the common questions asked by patients in my clinic is 'do I need to get vaccinated for flu every year?' I tell them that the flu vaccine is needed every year for two reasons." "First, a person's immune protection from vaccination declines over time, so an annual flu vaccine is needed for optimal protection. Second, because flu viruses are constantly changing, the composition of flu vaccines is reviewed annually, and vaccines are updated to protect against the viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming flu season."

in terms of journey time and cost - to accessing large centralised vaccination sites for some communities.“However, local solutions such as vaccine pop ups and local centres have now expanded vaccine access across Greater Manchester. These innovations, alongside providing culturally-sensitive vaccination options, are crucial for equitable access.”Issues around racism were raised in the discussion groups. Some people from ethnic minority backgrounds reported difficulties booking and traveling to vaccination appointments, as well as a lack of official vaccine information translated into additional languages.While Covid-19 vaccines were initially only available at booked appointments in mass vaccination centres, flu vaccines are available through GP practices and community pharmacies, which often operate drop-in services and are more accessible in areas of high deprivation.The research team recognise the partnership of Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership, Health Innovation Manchester and Graphnet Health, on behalf of GM localities in the provision of data required to undertake the work. This work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of their care and support.The paper Ethnic inequalities in Covid-19 vaccine uptake and comparison to seasonal Influenza vaccine uptake in Greater Manchester, UK: a cohort study is available here Share this page Covid-19 vaccine rollout worsened existing health inequalities, find researchers Share on: X Share on: Facebook Share on: LinkedIn Further reading Study at The University of Manchester opens in new window Contact us +44 (0) 161 306 6000 Contact details Find us The University of ManchesterOxford RdManchesterM13 9PLUK Connect with us Social media directory Disclaimer Data Protection Copyright notice Web accessibility Freedom of information Charitable status Royal Charter Number: RC000797 Close menu Home About News Newsroom News Archive Media LibraryStrict Rules Implemented To Limit Bird Flu - Island FM Island FM Navigation Home News Guernsey Jersey UK Sport Business and Finance Entertainment And Finally...

It comes after a third case of avian influenza was confirmed in the island. A red-breasted goose that died at Jersey Zoo last month has since tested positive for the virus. The case was confirmed on Friday (4 March) and followed an announcement in February that two common buzzards had died with bird flu. Further examination results from the latest case have shown the virus type to be HPAI H5N1. The World Animal Health Organisation has been informed. Jersey’s Chief Veterinary Officer has introduced formal formal restrictions and biosecurity measures. Local bird and poultry keepers must 'take all appropriate and and practicable steps to ensure that': · poultry and other captive birds are housed or otherwise kept separate from wild birds · poultry and other captive birds are provided with feed and water which is not accessible to wild birds · no bird gatherings take place, including (but not limited to) bird fairs, markets, shows and exhibitions · no game birds are released The requirements come into effect immediately at all locations within 3km of Jersey Zoo. Parts of the island further than 3km from the Trinity wildlife park away have until Friday 11 March to comply. “Confirmation of this type of Avian Influenza was expected, as this is the same strain being found in the UK and France. Following the confirmation, we are now bringing into force these formal biosecurity requirements to limit the contact local flocks have with other birds and so reduce the risk of further cases. While it will clearly depend on how the Avian Influenza situation develops in the Island, I would expect these measures to remain in place for at least one month." - Alistair Breed, Chief Veterinary Officer. The public are advised not to handle unwell or dead wild birds.
