NIAID A Phase 1 clinical trial of a novel influenza vaccine has begun inoculating healthy adult volunteers at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The placebo-controlled trial will test the safety of a candidate vaccine, BPL-1357, and its ability to prompt immune responses. The vaccine candidate was developed by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The single-site trial can enroll up to 100 people aged 18 to 55 years and is led by NIAID investigator Matthew J. Memoli, M.D. “Influenza vaccines that can provide long-lasting protection against a wide range of seasonal influenza viruses as well as those with pandemic potential would be invaluable public health tools,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “The scientific community is making progress on this pressing global health priority. The BPL-1357 candidate influenza vaccine being tested in this clinical trial performed very well in pre-clinical studies and we look forward to learning how it performs in people.” BPL-1357 is a whole-virus vaccine made up of four strains of non-infectious, chemically inactivated, low-pathogenicity avian flu virus. A study in animals, led by NIAID investigator Jeffery K. Taubenberger, M.D., Ph.D., and posted online as a pre-print, found that all mice receiving two doses of BPL-1357 vaccine delivered either intramuscularly or intranasally survived later exposure to lethal doses of each of six different influenza virus strains, including subtypes that were not included in the vaccine. Similar results were obtained in challenge experiments with BPL-1357-vaccinated ferrets. In the Phase 1 trial, volunteers will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into three groups and will receive two doses of placebo or vaccine spaced 28 days apart. Group A participants receive BPL-1357 intramuscularly along with intranasal saline placebo; Group B will receive doses of the candidate vaccine intranasally along with intramuscular placebo; volunteers in Group C receive intramuscularly and intranasally delivered placebo at both visits to the clinic. Neither the study clinicians nor the volunteers know the group assignments. Volunteers must not have received any type of flu vaccination in the eight weeks prior to enrollment and must agree to forego seasonal flu vaccination for approximately two months after the second vaccine (or placebo) dose. The study duration for each participant is approximately seven months. In addition to the two clinic visits to receive vaccine (or placebo), volunteers will be asked to return to the clinic seven times to provide blood and nasal mucosal samples that will be used by the investigators to detect and characterize immune responses. “With the BPL-1357 vaccine, especially when given intranasally, we are attempting to induce a comprehensive immune response that closely mimics immunity gained following a natural influenza infection,” said Dr. Memoli. “This is very different than nearly all other vaccines for influenza or other respiratory viruses, which focus on inducing immunity to a single viral antigen and often do not induce mucosal immunity.” “Our study will examine the safety of BPL-1357 and also will allow us to assess the importance of mucosal immunity against flu and whether a strategy of inducing both the cellular and antibody arms of the immune system can provide broader protection against the ever-changing influenza virus,” he added.

M2e-H3 stalk protein expressed and purified from Escherichia coli was thermostable, displaying native-like antigenic epitopes recognized by antisera of different HA subtype proteins and influenza A virus infections. Adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination induced M2e and stalk-specific IgG antibodies recognizing viral antigens on virus particles and on the infected cell surface, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, and antibody-dependent cytotoxic cell surrogate activity in mice. M2e-H3 stalk was found to confer protection against heterologous and heterosubtypic cross-group subtype viruses (H1N1, H5N1, H9N2, H3N2, H7N9) at similar levels in adult and aged mice. These results provide evidence that M2e-H3 stalk chimeric proteins can be developed as a universal influenza A virus vaccine candidate for young and aged populations.

However, the effectiveness of influenza vaccination inducing neutralizing antibodies to strain-specific hemagglutinin (HA) proteins is low due to constant antigenic changes in the HA1 receptor-binding globular head domain, rendering pre-existing immunity ineffective to new pandemics. For example, during the 2014–2015 season, drifting mutations in circulating H3N2 strains significantly reduced the effectiveness to 6% against H3N2 subtype virus1. Influenza A virus HA subtypes are phylogenetically divided into group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, H17, H18) and group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, H15)2. The HA on the virion is in the prefusion state and cleaved by host proteases into HA1 and HA23. In contrast to the highly variable antigenic region in the HA1 head domain, the HA2 stalk region is relatively conserved among the same HA group viruses, as recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies among the different subtype viruses, supporting the HA2 stalk domain as a promising target for developing a universal vaccine4,5.Previous studies reported that headless H1 stalk stabilized protein nanoparticle vaccines could provide protection against homologous H1N16,7 and heterosubtypic H5N1 virus6,8. Group 2 HA stalk proteins were reported to be more challenging in stabilizing the trimers since additional modifications had to be introduced9. Headless H3 and H7 stalk protein vaccines were constructed and shown to be immunogenic, inducing protection against homologous H3N2 and H7N9 viruses respectively9,10. The efficacy of stalk-based particularly group 2 stalk vaccines was low with homo and heterologous viruses as evidenced by substantial body weight loss in mice and the breadth of viruses tested was very limited6,9,10. In addition, challenges exist in H3N2 subtypes compared to H1N1 subtypes because of stalk mutations in circulating strains and low fitness genetic barrier for H3N2 viruses in vitro and in vivo11. These drawbacks have been difficult challenges to overcome in developing effective H3 stalk-based vaccines.Another promising antigenic target is the highly conserved extracellular domain of matrix 2 (M2e) protein in influenza A viruses12,13. M2e-based vaccines could provide broad cross protection against different strains and subtypes in mice12,13,14,15. Recombinant M2e vaccines were safe in phase 1 trials13,16,17. Low efficacy of M2e-based vaccines inducing non-neutralizing immunity is a concern for advancing toward a stand-alone vaccine. H1 plus H3 stalk protein vaccines layered onto the M2e core nanoparticles via chemical cross linking were reported to induce enhanced cross protection, compared to stalk or M2e alone vaccines18.In this study, we constructed a chimeric M2e and H3 stalk vaccine by genetically linking M2e repeat to the engineered H3 stalk domain with stabilizing HA1 N- and C-terminal region and point mutations (M2e-H3 stalk). E. Coli expressed M2e-H3 stalk protein displayed multi conserved M2e and stalk epitopes that are recognized by antisera of both group 1 and 2 influenza virus infections and different subtype HA proteins. Adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk protein vaccination induced broad protection against cross-group heterologous and heterosubtypic viruses despite a wider range of antigenic differences in adult and aged mice.ResultsRationale design and development of chimeric M2e-H3 stalk universal vaccine constructStructural conformation of HA2 stalk domain was previously modeled to be stabilized with the N- and C-terminal HA1 parts6,8. To extend and enhance the breadth of cross protection, a genetic fusion of M2e epitopes and H3 stalk was constructed (Fig. 1A–D). The H3 shortened stalk domain contains HA1 parts [aa 37-61, aa 305-338 of H3 HA from A/Aichi], and HA2 stalk in α-helix conformation [aa 1-117, Fig. 1B, D]. Tandem 2x repeat of M2e (23 aa) epitope domains was genetically fused to the H3 stalk N-terminus (M2e-H3 stalk) from A/Aichi/H3N2 influenza A virus.Fig. 1: Rationale design of chimeric M2e-H3 stalk protein, purification, and confirmation.A Schematic of full-length HA gene of influenza A virus (A/Aichi/H3N2), and the selective domains as a vaccine target are numbered in amino acid (aa 37-61, 305-338, 1-117) residues.

E, F The original un-cropped images of all blots including full molecular weight markers are provided in the supplementary information file (Supplementary Figure S11).Full size imageThe N-terminal half of the HA2 stalk domain is enriched with broadly neutralizing B cell epitopes as previously identified19,20,21. Therefore, the C terminal hydrophobic stalk part was excluded in the M2e-H3 stalk construct and replaced with the β-rich trimeric nature of the foldon sequence to enhance the stability and proper folding of the protein (Fig. 1D). Point mutations shown in Fig. 1D were introduced in the hydrophobic patches in the HA1 (V313TH1, I316NH1, and Y318TH1) and HA2 stalk domains (F64DH2, I67DH2, V74DH2, L111AH2). These point mutations were previously described to attenuate strong hydrophobic interactions and to avoid protein aggregations in neutral pH conformation, potentially improving the protein preparation in a soluble form7,22. In addition, cysteine residue on 321 position was replaced by serine residue (C321S) to prevent non-specific intermolecular disulfide formation7. A previous study demonstrated that the foldon trimer stabilizing domain was required for helical trimer formation and thermal stabilization, and for enabling resistance to proteolysis7. To facilitate protein purification, 6xHis tag was fused to the N-terminus of the M2e-H3 stalk domain23. Flexible linkers were used to connect independent domains and to facilitate the display of native-like conformation.A codon-optimized gene encoding M2e-H3 stalk protein was synthesized and cloned into pCold II, a high expression vector in E. Coli. Chimeric M2e-H3 stalk proteins were expressed in E. Coli cells. Cell lysates containing M2e-H3 stalk proteins were dissolved in 8M urea and fractions collected through the Ni-affinity His trap column were refolded into soluble M2e-H3 stalk protein with high purity (Fig. 1E). Chimeric M2e-H3 stalk proteins were further confirmed by western blot with M2e-specific mAb 14C2 and fusion epitope specific polyclonal antibody (pAb, Fig. 1F).Chimeric M2e-H3 stalk protein displays cross reactive antigenicity and thermostabilityEpitope integrity and thermostability of chimeric M2e-H3 stalk protein were examined. M2e-H3 stalk proteins were highly reactive with M2e-specific mAb 14C2 as well as rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for highly conserved HA2 aa1-13 fusion peptide, and HA2 aa14-27 peptide (Fig. 2A). M2e and fusion epitope antigenicity was retained even after incubation for 11 days at low (4 °C) to high temperature (50 °C) storage (Fig. 2B, C). The antigen was also reactive to antisera from mice recovered from H5N1 virus infection (Fig. 2D), indicating high thermostability of native-like epitope integrity. M2e-H3 stalk protein displayed strong antigenic reactivities for pAbs against HA proteins derived from diverse subtypes, including H1N1 (A/California/2009), H5N1 (A/Vietnam/2004), H3N2 (A/Swine/2011), and H7N9 (A/Shanghai/2013) (Fig. 2E). More importantly, antisera from infection with different subtype influenza A viruses (H5N1, H3N2, H7N9) exhibited high reactivities to the M2e-H3 stalk protein antigen (Fig. 2F). Overall, these results suggest that M2e-H3 stalk protein exposes diverse native-like conserved epitopes which are recognized by 14C2 mAb, different subtypes HA pAbs and antisera from virus infection.Fig. 2: Characterization of M2e-H3 stalk protein antigenicity, stability, and its cross-reactivity.A, E, and F The antigenicity of purified M2e-H3 stalk protein was determined by standard ELISA using antibodies specific for M2e (14C2), HA2 domain (rabbit poly IgG Abs) purified against HA2 epitopes including aa1-13 (poly HA2#1–13) or aa14-27 (poly HA2#14-27), and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against recombinant HA proteins from different subtypes (H1N1, H5N1, H3N2, H7N9); antisera of mice infected with influenza A live viruses (rgH5N1, H3N2, rgH7N9) were used. B–D Thermostability of M2e-H3 stalk protein was evaluated after storage at different temperatures (4, 20, 37, 50 °C) for 11 days by determination of retaining antigenicity.

E M2e-H3 stalk protein reactivity to pAbs against HA proteins from group 1(G1) viruses (H1N1, H5N1) and group 2 (G2) viruses (H3N2, H7N9).

We tested the effects of AS01-like adjuvant (QS-21 + MPL), major ingredients in AS01 liposome adjuvant licensed for use in herpes Zoster vaccination24,25. Adjuvant (QS-21 + MPL) included in M2e-H3 stalk protein prime boost IM vaccination of mice with a 3-week interval exhibited significant impacts on enhancing IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies specific for M2e and M2e-H3 stalk antigens (Supplementary Fig. S1A–G). The impact on eliciting immune response with vaccine dosage and adjuvants was evaluated with different vaccine antigen amounts with or without adjuvants. The adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk (20 µg) induced significantly higher IgG, IgG1, and IgG2 specific M2e-H3 stalk antibodies than the unadjuvanted group (Supplementary Fig. S1A–C). Four-fold less (5 µg) vaccine dose with adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk induced higher levels of IgG responses than those with 20 µg of vaccination without adjuvant. Therefore, we focused on testing immune responses and efficacy after vaccination with adjuvanted (QS-21+MPL) M2e-H3 stalk vaccination of mice. At 2 weeks after M2e-H3 stalk protein (20 µg) prime vaccination, substantial levels of IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a specific to M2e-H3 stalk protein antigens were induced after IM prime dose (Fig. 3A–C). After boost, the levels of IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies specific to vaccine antigens or M2e epitope, were increased by approximately 10 folds (Fig. 3A–C and Supplementary Fig. S1D–G). Boost immune sera showed substantial levels of IgG antibodies binding to HA2 fusion peptides (aa14-27), HA2 stalk epitope (HA2aa 74-98), one of the essential epitopes on stalk domain, and stalk protein (Fig. 3D–F). Also, M2e-H3 stalk boost sera displayed higher levels of IgG antibodies against inactivated group 2 viruses (A/HK/1968/H3N2 and A/Phil/H3N2) than those inactivated group 1 viruses (rgA/HK/1999/H9N2 and A/California/2009/H1N1) (Supplementary Fig. S2A–D).Fig. 3: Adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination induces antibodies recognizing M2e, FP, stalk, and group 1 and 2 viral antigens and virus-infected cell surface.BALB/c mice (n = 10) were intramuscular (i.m.) prime-boost immunized with adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk (20 µg) protein.

Statistical significance was determined by using two-way ANOVA; error bars indicate mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05;**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.Full size imageFurthermore, M2e-H3 stalk antisera strongly recognized both group 1 (G1) and group 2 (G2) viral antigens expressed on the surface of MDCK cells infected with a broad range of influenza A viruses (Fig. 3G, H). Antisera of adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination were highly reactive to the cell surface viral antigens after infection with group 2 influenza A viruses, including A/Phil H3N2, A/HK H3N2, rgA/Shanghai H7N9, and A/Nanchang/1995 H3N2 (Fig. 3G). Interestingly, antisera of M2e-H3 stalk vaccination were also highly reactive to the cell surface viral antigens after infection with group 1 influenza viruses (A/Cal H1N1, rgA/HK H9N2, A/WSN/1933 H1N1, A/PR8 H1N1, A/FM H1N1, and A/Viet/H5N1) (Fig. 3H).To investigate whether the M2e-H3 stalk vaccination would engage in Fc-mediated activation of effector Jurkat cells, supporting a possible role of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in providing cross-protection, we performed an ADCC assay. The ADCC surrogate reporter assay showed an elevated reporter signal with M2e-H3 stalk antisera on both group 2 A/Phil H3N2 (Fig. 3I) and group 1 (A/WSN/H1N1 in Fig. 3J, A/HK/H9N2 in Supplementary Fig. S8) influenza A virus-infected MDCK cells. In addition, M2e antibody-depleted M2e-H3 stalk antisera lost a significant fraction of their ADCC activity against A/WSN/H1N1 whereas M2e-RBD vaccine sera as a control of M2e alone antisera retained a substantial level of ADCC activity against A/WSN/H1N1 and showed less reduction in ADCC activity, as compared to the M2e-H3 stalk vaccine antisera (Fig. 3J). These ADCC experimental data suggest that M2e-specific IgG antisera might have played a significant role in exhibiting elevated levels of ADCC activity compared to the stalk antisera only when tested against A/WSN/H1N1 group 1 virus, and that the combination of M2e with H3 stalk antisera resulted in increasing the ADCC activity by over 20 folds. These results suggest that M2e-H3 stalk antisera has ADCC reporter assay activity against group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses and that adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination effectively induced antibodies recognizing M2e, stalk, and group 1 and 2 virus antigens on virions and on the surfaces of infected cells.M2e-H3 stalk protein vaccine provides broad and effective cross protection against group 2 virusesUnadjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk protein (20 µg) vaccination resulted in weight loss up to 20% and survival rates 80% after challenge with A/Phil (H3N2) virus whereas unvaccinated mice did not survive A/Phil virus infection (Fig. 4A). The adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk group exhibited significant higher efficacy of protection against lethal A/Phil virus infection, as evidenced by less weight loss (~8.5%) and 100% survival rates (Fig. 4A), supporting significant effects of adjuvant (QS-21+MPL) on enhancing the protection. To compare with the protection efficacy by M2e alone, we designed and purified another chimera protein (M2e-RBD) containing N-terminal M2e fused with receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV-2 spike protein and stabilized with a foldon trimer (Supplementary Fig. S4). M2e-RBD protein was reactive with M2e-specific mAb (14C2, Supplementary Fig. S4C) and the adjuvanted M2e-RBD group induced high levels of M2e-specific antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S4D). The M2e specific and M2e-H3 stalk-specific IgG levels in the adjuvanted vaccine groups were significantly higher than unadjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk (Fig. 4A, B). However, the adjuvanted M2e-RBD group showed partial protection against A/Phil/H3N2 virus lethal challenge (Fig. 4C). Therefore, we extended the efficacy testing of adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination to additional group 2 viruses. The adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk group provided significantly enhanced protection against H3N2 (A/Nanchang/1995, Fig. 4D) and rgH7N9 (A/Shanghai/2013, Fig. 4E), as shown by minimum weight loss (<4%) and 100% survival rates (Supplementary Figs. S9A and S9B). A moderate level of weight loss (~9 %) was observed in the adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk group after challenge with A/HK/1968 H3N2 virus (Fig. 4F and Supplementary Fig. S9C). These results indicate that adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk protein vaccination provides effective cross protection against the antigenically different group 2 viruses.Fig. 4: Adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination induces heterologous cross-protection against group 2 influenza A viruses.A M2e-specific serum IgG antibody levels in the different vaccine groups.

C–H The groups of mice (n = 5, 6–8 weeks old) vaccinated (prime or prime-boost) with M2e-H3 stalk protein (20 μg +/- adjuvant) or M2e-RBD (20 μg plus adjuvant) were intranasally challenged with group 2 influenza A viruses (H3N2, H7N9). Body weight changes and survival rates were daily monitored. C, D A/Phil/1982 H3N2 (3xLD50, 2.3 × 102 EID50), E A/Nanchang/1995 H3N2 (2xLD50, 3 × 106 EID50), F A/Sha/2013 H7N9 (3xLD50, 1.1 × 104 EID50), G A/HK/1968 H3N2 (3xLD50, 4 × 101 EID50). H Efficacy of thermostable M2e-H3 stalk protein. Mice vaccinated with M2e-H3 stalk protein pre-incubated at 50 °C for 11 days prior to prime-boost vaccination were challenged with A/Nanchang/1995 H3N2 (2xLD50, 3 × 106 EID50). I Efficacy of single dose M2e-H3 stalk vaccination. Mice with M2e-H3 stalk prime dose only were challenged with A/Nanchang/1995 H3N2 (2xLD50, 3 × 106 EID50) at 4 weeks after vaccination. Mock inf: mock group (adjuvant only) with virus infection, No Adj: M2e-H3 stalk vaccinated group without adjuvant. Statistical significance was determined using the two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test. Error bars indicate means ± SEM; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.Full size imageNext, to evaluate the thermostability of the vaccine antigen, the M2e-H3 stalk was stored at high temperature (50 °C) for 11 days prior to vaccination. The vaccinated mice with M2e-H3 stalk after storage at 50 °C showed 100% protection against A/Nanchang/H3N2 virus challenge (Fig. 4G and Supplementary Fig. S9D). A single dose of M2e-H3 stalk (20 µg) vaccination showed 100% protection against the A/Nanchang/H3N2 virus, preventing weight loss, while the mock group did not survive (Fig. 4H and Supplementary Fig. S9E). These results revealed that M2e-H3 stalk protein is thermostable, and prime-only vaccination can provide protection against the group 2 influenza A viruses.M2e-H3 stalk protein vaccination prevents severe weight loss and confers cross protection against group 1 virusesHA2 stalk immunity is known to be group specific and ineffective in inducing cross group protection6,9,10. Here we tested whether adjuvanted M2e-H3 (group 2) stalk protein vaccination would induce protection against group 1 viruses after 4–8 weeks post boost dose. The M2e-H3 stalk primed group showed complete protection against group 1 virus (A/WSN), although the mice displayed moderate weight loss (~10%) whereas minimum weight loss (<4%) was observed in the M2e-H3 stalk boosted group (Fig. 5A). Prevention of severe weight loss as well as 100% survival rates were observed with adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk protein vaccination after lethal challenge with H1N1 viruses (A/WSN/1933, A/PR8), H5N1 virus (rgA/Vietnam/2004), and H9N2 virus (rgA/HK/1997) (Fig. 5A–D). Cross-group protection against other additional H1N1 strains such as A/California/2009 and A/FM/1947 was observed with the outcomes of a low-level weight loss (5–8%) and 100% survival rates after adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk protein vaccination of mice (Fig. 5E, F). These results support that adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk protein vaccination can provide cross-group protection and prevent severe weight loss.Fig. 5: Adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk protein provides protection against heterologous cross-group 1 influenza A viruses.The groups of mice (n = 5, 6–8 weeks old) vaccinated with adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk (prime and prime-boost for WSN/H1N1 virus challenge group or prime-boost for the rest of virus challenge) were intranasally challenged with group 1 influenza A viruses (H1N1, H5N1, H9N2). Body weight changes and survival rates were monitored for 14 days. A A/WSN/1933 H1N1 (2xLD50, 1.5 × 102 EID50), B A/PR8/1934 H1N1(4xLD50,1.2 × 103 EID50), C A/Viet/2004 rgH5N1 (3xLD50, 2.6 × 104 EID50), D A/HK/1999 H9N2 (4xLD50, 7.8 × 101 EID50), E A/Cal/2009 H1N1(3xLD50, 2 × 103 EID50), F A/FM/1947 H1N1(3xLD50, 8 × 103 EID50). Mock inf: mock group (adjuvant only) with virus infection. Statistical significance was determined using the two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test.

M2e-H3 stalk vaccination significantly reduced lung viral titers by a magnitude of over 4 log10 day 6 post-challenge with A/Nanchang/1995(H3N2) compared to mock group (Fig. 6B). M2e and stalk-specific IgG secreting cell responses were determined in the culture supernatants of MLN and spleens collected at day 6 after challenge with rgA/Nanchang/1995 (H3N2) (Fig. 6C–G). M2e-specific IgG antibodies were secreted in both MLN and spleen cell cultures only from M2e-H3 stalk vaccinated mice (Fig. 6C, E). Also, significantly higher levels of stalk-specific IgG antibodies were produced in both MLN and spleen cell in vitro cultures from M2e-H3 stalk vaccinated mice (Fig. 6D, F).Fig. 6: Adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination bestows cross protection by lowering lung viral loads and inducing protective humoral immune responses.A Body weight changes in M2e-H3 stalk (20 µg) vaccinated young BALB/c mice (n = 5) for 6 days after challenge with lethal dose (2xLD50, 3 × 106 EID50) of A/Nanchang/H3N2 virus.

Body weight changes in naïve mice after intranasal inoculation with a mixture of M2e-H3 stalk vaccine immune sera or naive sera and group 1 influenza A virus (A/WSN H1N1, 4.2xLD50) (H) and group 2 influenza A virus (AgH7N9, 5xLD50) (I). Mock: mock group (adjuvant only no vaccine group (A–G) with virus infection). Naïve: mice group with no immunization and no virus infection. Mock: adjuvanted naïve sera (H, I). Statistical significance was determined by using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Test or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test; error bars indicate mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.Full size imageTo evaluate the role of humoral immune responses in providing cross-protection, naïve mice were intranasally infected with a mixture of lethal dose virus and boost antisera of adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination (Fig. 6H–I). Consistent with cross group protection, the naïve mice inoculated with a mixture of group 1 virus (A/WSN/H1N1) and M2e-H3 stalk boost sera showed complete protection without severe weight loss. In contrast, the control mice given this mixture of naïve sera and virus did not survive (Fig. 6H). Also, the naïve mice infected with lethal group 2 virus (rgA/H7N9) and M2-H3 stalk antisera were protected, despite a moderate weight loss (<10%), whereas mock sera with rgA/H7N9 virus failed to provide any protection (Fig. 6I).T-cell immune responses were assessed by ELIspot assay and flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 7A–H). M2e-stimulated IFN-γ+ secreting splenocyte cell spots were observed only in M2e-H3 stalk vaccinated mice at significant levels (Fig. 7A, C). Stalk-stimulated IFN-γ+ secreting splenocyte cell spots were induced at higher levels by adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination than those in naïve mice as determined day 6 post infection (Fig. 7B, D). Intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry analysis indicated significantly enhanced levels of M2e-specific IFN-γ+ CD4+ T cells and IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells in the airway bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung samples in the adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk group compared to those in naïve mice collected day 6 post infection (Figs. 7E–H and Supplementary Fig. S10). These data suggest that adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination induces enhanced lung viral clearance and humoral and cellular immune responses.Fig. 7: Adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccine induces protective T-cell immunity.Cytokine-secreting T-cell immune responses were evaluated in M2e-H3 stalk immunized mice at 6 days post-infection with A/Nanchang H3N2 virus.

Impact of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell depletion on protection in M2e-H3 stalk vaccinated mice before challenging with AgH7N9 virus (I). Statistical significance was determined by using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Test or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test; error bars indicate mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.Full size imageIn addition, the contribution of T-cell immunity to cross-protection was determined in boost-vaccinated M2e-H3 stalk by depleting CD4+ and CD8+ cells before lethal challenge with rgA/Shanghai (H7N9) virus (Fig. 7I). Depleting CD4 and CD8 T cells in M2e-H3 stalk vaccinated mice resulted in significantly more weight loss (~12%) than the T cell-nondepleted M2e-H3 stalk vaccinated mice which displayed minimum weight loss (~6%) and quickly recovered, supporting the contribution of T cells to enhancing cross-protection.M2e-H3 stalk vaccine provides effective protection against both group 1 and 2 viruses in old-aged miceGroups of old aged (16 months old) mice were prime-boost vaccinated with adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk protein (20 µg) at a 3-week interval. High levels of M2e (Fig. 8A–C) and stalk-specific IgG antibodies were induced by adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination of aged mice (Fig. 8D–F). Similarly, the levels of IgG specific for M2e-H3 stalk were significantly increased after boost in aged mice (Supplementary Fig. S3A–C). The vaccinated aged mice were protected against A/Phil (H3N2, group 2) virus challenge at 8 weeks after boost and prevented weight loss to minimum (<5%) compared to the mock control group displaying severe weight loss (>20%) with partial 50% survival rates (Fig. 8G). Consistent, high efficacy of protection against a lethal dose of rgA/Shanghai/2013 (H7N9, group 2) was observed with minimum weight loss (<5%) in the vaccinated aged mice (Fig. 8H). Similarly, adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination of aged mice provided protection against H1N1 group 1 viruses (A/California/2009, A/WSN/1933), preventing severe weight loss (<7%) whereas the mock control mice did not survive H1N1 virus infection (Fig. 8I, J). These results suggest that M2e-H3 stalk vaccination induces effective protection against both group 1 and 2 viruses in old-aged mice.Fig. 8: Aged mice with adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination induces cross-group virus protection.Aged mice (16 months old, n = 5) were i.m. prime-boost immunized with adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk protein. A–F M2e-H3 stalk vaccination of aged mice induced IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies against M2e and stalk protein. IgG to M2e (A), IgG1 to M2e (B), IgG 2a to M2e (C). IgG to stalk (D), IgG1 to stalk (E), IgG 2a to stalk (F). G–J Efficacy of cross-group virus protection in aged mice as measured by body weight changes and survival rates. Aged mice (n = 5) at 3 weeks after boost vaccination were intranasally challenged with a lethal dose of either group 1 (A/WSN H1N1, A/Cal H1N1) or group 2 (A/Phil H3N2, A/Sha/ H7N9) influenza A viruses. A/Phil H3N2 (G), A/Sha/ H7N9 (H), A/WSN H1N1 (I), A/Cal H1N1 (J). Statistical significance was determined using the two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test. Error bars indicate means ± SEM; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.Full size imageM2e-H3 stalk protein vaccine dosage effects on inducing IgG responses and protection efficacy with M2e only vaccinesWe tested different dosage effects of M2e-H3 stalk protein (5 µg, 10 µg, 20 µg) on inducing IgG responses and protection after prime boost adjuvanted vaccination. There were no significant differences in the levels of IgG Abs specific for M2e and stalk antigens between the 10 µg and 20 µg vaccine dose groups whereas the 5 µg dose group induced lower levels of M2e and M2e-H3 stalk binding antibodies than those in the higher dose groups (Supplementary Fig. S1A–E).We also compared M2-H3 stalk vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy with M2e only vaccines (M2e-RBD, 5xM2e VLP). High levels of IgG antibodies specific for M2e were induced by vaccination with M2e-H3 stalk, M2e-RBD, or 5xM2e virus-like particle (VLP) without significant differences among the groups (Supplementary Fig. S5A). The group of M2e-H3 stalk but not M2e only vaccination induced IgG antibodies highly reactive to inactivated group 2 viruses such as A/H7N9 and A/HK/H3N2 (Fig. 9A, B). In addition, M2e-H3 stalk vaccination induced significantly higher levels of IgG antibodies binding to cell-expressed viral antigens after infection of MDCK cells with group 2 viruses (A/Nanchang/H3N2, A/HK/H3N2) and group 1 viruses (A/WSN/H1N1, A/H9N2) than those by M2e alone vaccination (Supplementary Fig. S5B–E).Fig. 9: Adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccine dosage effects and protective advantages over M2e only vaccines.Young adult mice (6–8 weeks old, n = 5) were vaccinated with 5xM2e VLP (10 µg) or M2e-RBD (20 µg) or M2-H3 stalk protein at different doses (5 µg,10 µg, 20 µg). A IgG antibodies specific for A/Sha H7N9 virus. B IgG antibodies specific for A/HK H3N2 virus.

E Protective efficacy comparison of M2e-H3 stalk and M2e only vaccines after A/HK/1968 H3N2 (12xLD50, 1.4 × 102 EID50) virus challenge. Statistical significance was determined using the two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test. Error bars indicate means ± SEM; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.Full size imageThe groups of mice vaccinated with different doses (5 ug, 10 ug, 20 ug) of M2e-H3 stalk were similarly well protected against rgA/Shanghai/H7N9 virus, preventing weight loss (Fig. 9C). Meanwhile, the groups of mice vaccinated with 5xM2e VLP (10 ug) or M2-RBD (20 ug) displayed a moderate level (~10%) weight loss after rgA/Shanghai/H7N9 virus challenge (Fig. 9D). The mock group did not survive after virus infection. After challenge with a high lethal dose of A/HK/H3N2 virus (10x LD50), all mice in the 5xM2e VLP group died of infection (Fig. 9E). The M2e-H3 stalk group was completely protected against A/HK/H3N2 virus challenge, displaying only a moderate level (10%) weight loss. The mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) collected from either the M2e-H3 stalk or M2e-RBD vaccination group, after challenging with A/Nanchang/H3N2 virus, were highly effective in inducing rapid plasma cell responses secreting M2e-specific IgG antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S6A). As expected, only the M2e-H3 stalk group showed IgG antibodies specific for stalk domain at significantly higher levels in culture supernatants of MLN (Supplementary Fig. S6B). These results support that chimeric M2e-H3 stalk vaccine can be more effective in inducing cross protection than M2e alone based vaccine construct.DiscussionGroup 1 stalk only vaccines were ineffective in inducing cross protection against heterosubtypic and group 2 viruses due to sequence variations26,27. In particular, the vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 over the past decade was in a low range of approximately 33%28 and significantly low down to 6% during the 2014–2015 season1. New H3N2 variants with drifting mutations emerged with increased virulence29. The outbreak of group 2 H7N9 subtype virus represented one of potential pandemics30. Thus, it is of high priority to develop an effective group 2 or cross group vaccine. Here we presented a unique design and successful expression of M2e-H3 stalk protein construct in E. coli, which was thermostable and antigenically exposing conserved M2e, fusion peptide, and native-like stalk epitopes recognized by antisera of live group 1 and 2 virus infections. Vaccination of mice using M2e-H3 stalk protein with adjuvant (QS-21 + MPL) induced IgG antibodies specific for M2e, HA stalk, and group 2 viruses and, to a lesser degree, group 1 viruses. Mice with adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination were broadly protected against both group 1 and 2 viruses, supporting further development as a promising universal influenza A vaccine candidate.Earlier studies reported isolation and characterization of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs: FI6v3, CR9114, CT149) that could broadly neutralize group 1 and 2 viruses20,31,32. Footprint and X-ray crystallography studies revealed the contact area between broadly neutralizing mAbs and HA conserved domains and residues. The group 1 HA stem mAbs (C179, CR6261, F10) were shown to contact the HA2 stem N-terminal fusion peptide region and helix A domain proximal to the membrane as well as the N- and C-terminal regions of HA1, with some differences among the mAbs5,21,33,34. The contact sites of group 2 HA stem mAbs (CR8020, CR8043) and cross-group mAbs (FI6v3, CR9114, CT149) were mapped to be HA2 multi-domains including the fusion peptide C-terminal region, an outmost edge of the β-sheet and helix A (Fig. 1D)5. Although the contact sites were overlapping with those of group 1 mAbs, the group 2 and cross-group mAbs appeared to have some differences such as a larger area of contact spanning the fusion peptides, the viral membrane proximal outer β-strands preceding helix A (Fig. 1D). These epitope mapping data of broadly neutralizing mAbs have provided a rational design of stalk stabilized immunogens. Corbett et al. (2019) reported group 2 headless H3 stalk-stabilized (H3ssF) and H7 stalk-stabilized (H7ssF) ferritin nanoparticle immunogens constructed through helix stabilization (HA2 aa 60-92 replaced with a G-rich loop), B loop optimization, and multiple point mutations, and expressed in mammalian cells9. Vaccination of mice with adjuvanted H3ssF and H7ssF immunogens induced subtype virus specific neutralizing activities and moderate efficacy of protection against lethal challenge9. However, H3ssF and H7ssF immunogens did not induce heterologous cross neutralizing Abs and cross protection remains unknown, suggesting a limitation of stem only vaccination9. In an attempt to overcome limited cross protection, we designed a chimeric M2e-H3 stalk construct expressed in E. coli. The M2e-H3 stalk contains M2e repeat, HA1 stem-interacting fragments, HA2 aa1-117 stem domain composed of fusion peptide with membrane proximal β-strands, helix A, loop B with point mutations, and helix C, which covers most epitopes known for broadly neutralizing stalk mAbs (Fig. 1D). Antigenicity data of M2e-H3 stalk suggest the presentation of native-like conserved epitopes to be exposed for recognition by Abs specific for both group 1 and 2 HA and antisera from infection with live viruses in addition to M2e and stalk.Full-length H3 stalk (aa 1-172) proteins with point mutations to retain prefusion-like conformation and headless HA1 fragments expressed in E. coli provided low efficacy of homologous and partial heterologous H3N2 protection in mice22. In a follow up study, E. coli expressed, reduced sizes of H3 stalk helix domains (aa 44-113) with similar mutations and HA1 fragments conferred only partial survival protection (40-50%) against homologous H3N2 virus despite the induction of cross-reactive IgG Abs35. Sutton et al. (2017) demonstrated that the group 2 headless H3 and H7 stalk immunogens with several residues extended (aa 37-115) and stabilizing point mutations, expressed in E. coli, induced homologous H3N2 protection with minimum weight loss but low efficacy of cross protection against heterologous H3N2 or heterosubtypic H7N9 virus as shown by severe weight loss and partial survival rates10. Although it is difficult to have direct comparisons to those in previous studies, the M2e repeat and fusion peptide regions with the membrane proximal outer β-strands, helix A and C in M2e-H3 stalk (HA2 aa 1-117, Fig. 1), which contain shared and conserved epitopes recognized the cross group broadly neutralizing mAbs (FI6v3, CR9114, CT149), might have contributed to broad and high cross group protection.Stabilization of the group 2 HA headless-stalk proteins required additional modifications as compared to the group 1 HA stalk9. Here we demonstrate that M2e-H3 stalk protein vaccination induced broad cross-protection against both group 1 (H1N1, rgH5N1, rgH9N2) and group 2 (H3N2, rgH7N9) influenza A viruses, which supports that M2e-H3 stalk protein can be developed as a potential universal vaccine candidate. As expected, H3N2 virus specific IgG responses were induced at higher levels by M2e-H3 stalk vaccination than those for intragroup heterosubtypic (rgH7N9) or cross-group viruses (H1N1, rgH9N2). The HA stalk sequence homology is as high as over 94% among the same H3N2 subtype viruses but reduced to below 70% among different subtypes within the group 2, and further down to 60% homology with among the group 1 viruses (Supplementary Fig. S7). Despite the low homology of stalk sequences, M2e-H3 stalk provided cross protection against heterosubtypic rgH7N9 and group 1 viruses such as H1N1 (A/WSN, A/PR8, A/FM, A/Cal/2009), rgH5N1, and rgH9N2. The efficacy of cross protection by M2e-H3 stalk was significantly improved as evidenced by preventing weight loss in mice under lethal challenge. Particularly, it is the first time to report that M2e-H3 stalk provided cross protection against both group 1 and 2 viruses in aged mice without apparent weight loss under lethal challenge. Since the mortality rates of seasonal influenza viruses are relatively low, a condition of lethal dose challenge is considered appropriate to assess the efficacy of cross protection. In contrast, previous studies reported severe weight loss after heterologous challenge in mice with adjuvanted headless-stalk vaccination7,22,35. Nonetheless, it is not possible to compare the cross protective efficacy with other studies, due to the differences in vaccine doses, adjuvants used, challenge virus and doses, and the number of vaccinations.There are several possible immune mechanisms for broad cross-group virus protection by M2e-H3 stalk vaccination. M2e humoral and cellular immunity has been known to provide cross protection against both group 1 and 2 viruses36. M2 is expressed on the infected cell surfaces at high levels but incorporated into influenza virions at very low levels37. Fc receptors (FcR) were reported to play a critical role for cross protective immunity by M2e and stalk-based vaccination38,39,40, suggesting clearance of virus-infected cells or virion immune complexes via ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and complement-dependent cytolysis. In support of ADCC as a possible protective mechanism, M2e-H3 stalk immune sera exhibited high levels of binding IgG Abs to various group 1 and 2 viral antigens expressed on the cell surface as well as high activity of ADCC surrogate effector Jurkat cells on the MDCK cells infected with group 1 and 2 viruses. Passive transfer of antisera of M2e-H3 stalk conferred cross-protection against both group 1 (A/WSN, H1N1) and 2 (rgH7N9) viruses, supporting a significant role of humoral immunity. In addition, M2e is known to contain epitopes for T cells in mice and humans13,41. In support of T-cell immunity, we observed substantial levels of IFN-γ expressing cell spots and particularly IFN-γ producing CD4+ T cells in M2e-H3 stalk vaccinated mice. Also, depletion of T cells from M2e-H3 stalk vaccinated mice resulted in lower efficacy of protection, suggesting an important role of T cells in cross protection. Enhanced group specific cross protection was previously reported in mice with double-layer nanoparticle vaccine prepared by M2e cores chemically cross linked to H1 or H3 stalk proteins expressed in insect cells18. M2e-H3 stalk protein is unique in structural design, containing known epitopes of broadly neutralizing mAbs, thermostable, and in conferring cross protection against a wide range of cross group viruses including H1, H3, H5, H7, and H9 subtypes. Chimeric M2e-H3 stalk protein overcomes the limitation of M2e alone or stalk only based vaccines. E. coli bacterial expression of M2e-H3 stalk enables rapid scale-up during a pandemic outbreak even in low resource countries. Further studies will be needed for better mechanistic understanding and correlates of cross group protection and to test the efficacy of M2e-H3 stalk as a universal influenza vaccine candidate in a more relevant ferret animal model to support the clinical trials.MethodsRationale molecular design and synthesis of M2e-H3 stalk vaccine constructHA gene sequence of influenza A virus [A/Aichi/12/1968 (H3N2)] was obtained from GenBank (ID: M55059) and used to design the H3 stalk vaccine construct. The conserved domains of HA were identified by multiple alignment of influenza A virus sequences. The amino acid (aa) residues of the HA1 (aa37-61 and 305-338) and HA2 (aa 1-117) domains were included as a vaccine target based on the major conserved region of the HA stalk and stabilizing domain. Point mutations were introduced on the hydrophobic aa residues of the targeted fragments by replacing with polar and hydrophilic residues without affecting the structure of the HA stem. Cysteine 321 was replaced with serine (C321S) on the HA1 region. The conserved M2e sequence (SLLTEVETPIRNEWGSRSNDSS) repeat was introduced in the N terminal and the foldon sequence was connected to the C terminal of the selected H3 stalk domain. The structure of M2e and foldon was derived from the protein data bank (PDB) ID codes 4N8C and 1RFO, respectively. The 3D structure of HA was predicted using the SWISS model and visualized in PyMol. The newly designed vaccine construct was named as M2e-H3 stalk. The nucleotide sequence of the M2e-H3 stalk construct was codon-optimized for expression in Escherichia coli (E. Coli) and synthesized by Genscript (USA). In addition, to develop an M2e alone based vaccine, receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was fused with the M2e epitope and β-rich trimeric nature of foldon sequence on the N and C terminal with soluble linker sequences, respectively. The vaccine construct was codon-optimized for E. coli; synthesized and named as M2e-RBD.Gene cloning, protein expression, and purificationThe synthesized M2e-H3 stalk gene was ligated into the NdeI (5′ end) and HindIII (3′ end) restriction enzyme site within the pCold II cold expression vector (cat no:3362, Takara Bio. Inc) containing N-terminal 6x His-tagged, and subsequently transformed into E.coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysis cells (cat no: 709563, Novagen, USA). The protein expression was induced with 1 mM of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 12–14 h at 16 °C when the OD600 reached 0.4–0.5. The protein expressed cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM CHAPS, 8 M urea, 10 mM imidazole, followed by sonication; cleared lysates were applied to His tag affinity Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen, USA). The beads were washed with lysis buffer containing 25 mM imidazole. The bound protein was eluted with a lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Purified protein was refolded by step dialysis in 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT with a gradual decrease in the concentration of urea. The final refolded protein was further dialyzed using PBS (overnight at 4 °C), quantified, and stored at −80 °C until further use. Similarly, the M2e-RBD protein was purified and characterized. 5xM2e VLP (5xM2e tandem repeats) vaccine was prepared using the baculovirus system14, and used as one of the M2e-based vaccine controls. The purified proteins were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and evaluated by western blot using M2e-specific 14C2 mAb and H3-stalk specific rabbit pAbs. The M2e and stalk epitopes in the purified M2e-H3 stalk protein were determined by standard ELISA using M2e and stalk epitope-specific antibodies and live virus antisera.Antibodies, peptides, and proteinM2e-specific mAb (14C2) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (cat no: sc-32238, USA). The following rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) specific for stalk were generated by GenScript (USA): anti-fusion peptide (HA2aa1-13: GLFGAIAGFIEGG) and anti-H3-FP specific for HA2aa14-27 (WEGMVDGWYGFRHQ). Goat polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) specific for recombinant HA were acquired from BEI resources (ATCC/NIH): anti-H1 HA pAbs (NR 15696); anti-H5 HA pAbs (NR 2705); anti-H3 HA pAbs (NR-48597); anti-H7 HA pAbs (NR-48597). M2e peptide and stalk peptide aa74-98 were generated by GenScript. In brief, E. coli codon-optimized consensus full-length stalk protein (without M2e) was expressed in pGE-RID4 vector and BL21 star (DE3) pLysS cells, and the recombinant stalk protein was purified and used as a control stalk protein42.Ethics statementThe study in BALB/c mice was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Mice were maintained in an animal facility at Georgia State University, USA. All the mouse experiments were approved by Georgia State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC A21004)Immunization and virus challenge studiesBALB/c mice (Female, 6 to 8 weeks old) were intramuscularly (i.m.) immunized in a prime-boost schedule (3-week interval) in the hind legs. M2e-H3 stalk proteins (5–20 μg) were used for prime with adjuvants [10 μg QS-21 (cat no: 34-6-07-2, Desert King International) plus 1 μg monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL, cat no: L6895, Sigma Aldrich)] and boost with half dose adjuvant (5 μg QS-21 + 0.5 μg MPL). For aged mice, 16-month-old BALB/c mice were i.m. immunized. Blood samples were collected after 2 weeks of prime and boost immunization. Four to eight weeks after boost, mice were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of influenza A viruses. Weight loss of >20% was considered as the IACUC endpoint. Group 1 influenza A viruses were as follows: A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (A/PR8/H1N1), A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (A/Cal/H1N1), A/WSN/1933 H1N1 (A/WSN/H1N1), mouse-adapted A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947 H1N1 (A/FM/H1N1), and reverse genetic (rg) reassortant A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 with A/PR8 backbone (A/Viet/H5N1), and A/Hong Kong/1073/1999 H9N2 (A/HK/H9N2). Group 2 viruses used include A/Philippine/2/1982 H3N2 (A/Phil/H3N2), A/Hong Kong/1/1968 H3N2 (A/HK/H3N2), reassortants A/Shanghai/11/2013 H7N9 with A/PR8 backbone (A/Sha/H7N9), and A/Nanchang/933/1995 H3N2 with A/PR8 backbone (A/Nanchang/H3N2).Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)M2e-H3 stalk protein vaccine antigenicity using antibodies (1:2000x) specific for known epitopes, IgG antibody responses in sera and in vitro cultures were determined by standard ELISA using M2e peptide (100 ng) M2e-H3 stalk or stalk protein (50 ng), H3 stalk peptides (100 ng), or inactivated viruses (200 ng) as coating antigens. To evaluate antigenicity, the coated antigen was incubated with gene specific primary antibody (1:2000x) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000x) as a secondary antibody followed by tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Cat no: 00-4201, Invitrogen) and 1M H3PO4 to stop the color reaction. The IgG antibody responses or IgG subtypes in sera were determined by using 10-fold serially diluted mice sera and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cat no:1030-05, Southern Biotech) IgG1(Cat no:1070-05, Southern Biotech), or IgG2a (Cat no:1080-05, Southern Biotech) as secondary antibodies to determine total IgG or IgG isotype antibodies. The optical density at 450 nm was read using an ELISA reader14.Determination of lung viral titersThe lung tissues collected day 5 or 6 post infection were homogenized, serially diluted (10-fold) lung extracts (200 µl) injected into 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs, and then incubated for 3 days at 37 °C. The viral titers were presented in median embryo infectious dose (EID50) by hemagglutination assay in allantois fluids. The median embryo infectious dose (EID50) was calculated based on the Reed and Muench method14.In vitro detection of IgG antibodyMediastinal lymph node (MLN) and spleen cells were isolated at 5 days post infection from young adult (6-week-old) BALB/c mice, immunized and challenged with A/Nanchang/H3N2. The cells were cultured on the plates pre-coated with antigens (M2e peptide, M2e-H3 stalk, or stalk protein for 24 h or 5 days at 37 °C). ELISA was used to determine the IgG antibody titers; the total amount of IgG antibody was quantified based on the standard curve using different concentrations of purified standard IgG (Cat no 1010-01, Southern Biotech)43,44.Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) ELISpotThe IFN-γ+ secreting cells were evaluated using an ELISpot assay. Briefly, splenocytes and lung cells were isolated 4 weeks after boost immunization and challenged with A/Nanchang/H3N2 virus. IFN-γ+ secreting cells were evaluated on the 96-well ELISpot plates pre-coated with 150 ng of IFN-γ-capture antibody (Cat. no. 551216, BD Pharmingen). ELISpot plates were seeded with splenocytes (5 × 105 cells) or lung cells (2 × 105 cells) and incubated with the stimulators: M2e peptide (400 ng), stalk protein (200 ng). After 72 h, the plates were incubated with a biotinylated mouse anti-IFN-γ antibody (1:1000x, cat. no. 554410, BD Pharmingen) followed by alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin antibody (1:1000x, cat. no. 554066, BD Pharmingen), and the IFN-γ-secreting cell spots were visualized with color-developing 3,3'-diaminobenzidine substrates and counted by an ELISPOT reader14.Flow cytometryThe lung and BALF cell samples were harvested at 6 days post infection from the mice immunized and challenged with A/Nanchang/H3N2 virus. The isolated lung and BALF cells were in vitro culture-stimulated with 5 µg/ml of M2e peptide and/or stalk protein with Golgi stopper (2 µg/mL). After 5 h culture, the cells were stained with mouse anti-CD3-PacificBlue (300x dilution, cat no: 100214, clone 17A2, BioLegend), anti-CD4-biotin (300x dilution, cat no: 13-0042-85, clone RM4-5, eBioscience), streptavidin-PE/Cy5 (300x dilution, cat no: 15-4317-82, eBioscience), and anti-CD8-FITC (300x dilution, cat no: MA5-16759, clone 53–6.7, eBiosciences), followed by fixation and permeabilization using a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (10x dilution, cat no: 554715, BD Biosciences) and then, staining of intracellular cytokine using IFN-γ mAb (anti-mouse IFN-γ-PE, 200x dilution, cat no: 505808, clone XMG1.2, BioLegend). The IFN-γ+ T-cells were acquired by Becton-Dickinson LSR-II/Fortessa flow cytometer (BD) and analyzed by a sequential lymphocyte gating strategy (Supplementary Fig. S10) using FlowJo software (FlowJo V10, Tree Star, Inc.)45.In vivo protection of immune sera and in vivo T-cell depletionMock sera or antisera of M2e-H3 stalk vaccination were heat-inactivated, diluted (4-fold), and mixed with a lethal dose of A/Sha/H7N9 or A/WSN/H1N1 virus. Body weight and survival rates were monitored after intranasal inoculation of naive mice with the mixture of virus and antisera. T-cell depletion in mice was performed with anti-CD4 (GK1.5)cat no: BE0003-1 and anti-CD8 (53.6.7) mAbs (Cat no BE0061 BioXCell)46, a day before challenge, 200 µg anti-CD4 mAb and 150 µg anti-CD8 mAb intraperitoneally; a day after challenge, 15 µg anti-CD4 and 10 µg anti-CD8 intranasally. The levels of CD4 and CD8 T-cells were determined by flow cytometry.Cell surface ELISA and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assayThe MDCK cells were seeded on the 96-well cell culture plates (3x104 cells) and then infected with group 1 and 2 influenza A viruses. After 24 h of infection, the virus-infected MDCK cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with diluted sera, followed by ELISA to determine IgG antibodies bound to the viral antigens on the MDCK cell surfaces. M2e-specific antibodies in antisera of adjuvanted M2e-H3 stalk vaccination were depleted by serially repeat incubation on the plate coated with M2e peptide antigens to prepare M2e-antibody deficient M2e-H3 stalk antisera for a control ADCC assay. The ADCC Reporter Kit (cat no:M1215, Promega Life Sciences, USA) was used to measure the activation of Jurkat cells mimicking natural killer cells47 as a surrogate indicator for ADCC by serum antibodies bound to the virus-infected MDCK cells (3 × 104 cells). After incubation with Jurkat (7 × 104) effector cells for 6 h, luminescence was read to calculate fold increases using a Cytation five imaging reader (BioTek).Statistical analysesData analyses were performed using Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc). The statistical significance was determined by either one- or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison or Bonferroni post-test. All the data were represented as the mean ± the standard errors of the mean (SEM). P-values < 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The researchers developed the universal flu vaccine by genetically linking two highly conserved (relatively unchanged over time) portions of the virus – the extracellular domain of matrix 2 (M2e) and the stalk protein found in influenza A H3N2 viruses. The findings, published in the journal npj Vaccines, show that M2e-stalk protein vaccination induced broad protection against different influenza virus strains and subtypes by universal vaccine-mediated immunity in adult and aged mice. Scientists have faced obstacles in the development of effective vaccines for influenza viruses because the head portion of the influenza virus is constantly changing. When comparing the H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses, particular challenges exist in H3N2 subtypes because of stalk mutations in circulating strains and the unstable structure of stalk proteins for H3N2 viruses. These drawbacks have been difficult to overcome in developing effective H3 stalk-based vaccines. Vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 was low during the past decade, only about 33 percent, and dropped to 6 percent during the 2014-2015 flu season. New mutations of H3N2 variants emerged with increased virulence. Also, the outbreak of H7N9, another influenza A subtype, caused concern for potential pandemics. Therefore, developing an effective vaccine to protect against these viruses is a high priority. “The M2e-stalk protein, for the first time, could be easily produced in bacterial cell cultures at high yields and was found to confer protection against heterologous and heterosubtypic cross-group subtype viruses (H1N1, H5N1, H9N2, H3N2 and H7N9) at similar levels in adult and aged mice,” said Dr. Sang-Moo Kang, senior author of the study and a professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State. “These results provide evidence that M2e-stalk genetic fusion proteins can be produced in a large scale at low cost and developed as a universal influenza A virus vaccine candidate for young and aged populations.” The study found this novel M2e-stalk protein vaccine induced M2e and stalk-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that recognized antigenically diverse influenza viral antigens on virus particles and on the infected cell surface. In addition, the vaccine stimulated protective cellular T cell immunity and effective lung influenza viral clearance in mice. Co-authors of the study include Jeeva Subbiah (first author), Judy Oh, Ki-Hye Kim, Chong-Hyun Shin, Bo Ryoung Park, Noopur Bhatnagar, Bao-Zhong Wang and Sang-Moo Kang of the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State; and Baik-Lin Seong of the College of Medicine and the Vaccine Innovative Technology Alliance (VITAL)-Korea at Yonsei University in the Republic of Korea.

The popular press has adopted the phrase “Flurona” to describe this. However, scientists and physicians do not use the term “Flurona.”Coronavirus dataAll data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub for the most recent information on COVID-19.The coronavirus, or COVID-19, is a newer disease, so scientists are still attempting to understand more about it. Scientists do not yet know the rate of occurrence. This article reviews what Flurona is, comparisons between flu and COVID-19, and more.What is Flurona?Share on Pinterestti-ja/Getty Images“Flurona” is a term that some people use to describe having influenza (flu) and COVID-19 at the same time. However, medical professionals do not use this term. While it is not very common, a person can have influenza and COVID-19 at the same time. COVID-19 and influenza are both viral diseases that affect the respiratory system. Symptoms COVID-19 and flu have similar symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the symptoms for both conditions can range from asymptomatic to severe. For this reason, it is hard to know the underlying cause based on the symptoms alone.In the case of either illness, at least 1 day may pass between the time a person contracts the virus and the start of symptoms. A person can also spread either virus before becoming symptomatic.The symptoms of both flu and COVID-19 include:coughfever or chillsfatigueshortness of breath or trouble breathingmuscle pain or achessore throatrunny or stuffy nosevomitingheadachediarrheachanges in or loss of taste or smell — more common in COVID-19Similarities Different viruses cause COVID-19 and flu, but the two conditions have several similarities, including their symptoms.Some other similarities are:Risk of severe infection: Pregnant people, older individuals, and those with preexisting conditions have a higher chance of experiencing severe effects from both conditions.Complications: Both conditions can cause potentially serious or fatal complications, including pneumonia; worsening chronic conditions, heart attack; stroke; respiratory failure; inflammation in the heart, brain, or muscles; multiple organ failure; acute respiratory distress syndrome; or secondary infections.Transmission: The influenza virus and the SARS-CoV-2 virus are both airborne. They attach to particles propelled into the air through talking, sneezing, or coughing. A person may spread either virus at least 1 day before their symptoms appear. Both viruses can also spread if particles land on a surface, such as a door handle or table, and a person who touches the surface then touches their nose, mouth, or eyes. Treatment: Both conditions may require specialized treatments in a hospital setting, particularly for complications or underlying health conditions.Vaccinations: Vaccinations are available for both flu and COVID-19.DifferencesWhile flu and COVID-19 have many similarities, they also have distinct differences. The following are some common differences between the two conditions:Risk of severe illness: According to the CDC, COVID-19 is more likely than flu to cause severe illness that can result in hospitalization or death, even in younger, generally healthy people. It also presents the possibility of post-COVID-19 infections or multisystem inflammatory syndrome, whereas flu does not.Complications: People who have flu have a higher rate of developing secondary bacterial infections than those who have COVID-19. However, people with COVID-19 have a chance of developing multisystem inflammatory syndrome, blood clots, and post-COVID-19 conditions.Transmission rate: COVID-19 is more contagious than flu and has links to superspreader events that contribute to rapid increases in the number of people who have contracted the virus.Treatment: Doctors have several approved antiviral medications to treat flu at home and in the hospital. COVID-19 has emerging treatments, including approved antiviral medications. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also authorized the emergency use of not-yet-approved therapies to help treat COVID-19.Vaccinations: Each year, several vaccinations become available for flu, while only three approved vaccinations are available for COVID-19.What is the likelihood of getting Flurona?According to a 2021 review, the reported rate of simultaneous infection with both viruses is about 0.4% on the American continent. The rate is higher in Asia, at about 4.5%. The same review notes that the exact rate worldwide is unknown because of a lack of data from some countries. Still, the review authors estimate that about 1.2% of people with COVID-19 might also have flu.Another 2021 study notes that of more than 1,000 people with COVID-19 screened for flu, only 6 had a coinfection (0.54%). The authors conclude that, while more studies are necessary, Flurona is rare.Who is at risk of getting Flurona?Nearly anyone can get both flu and COVID-19 at the same time if they come into close contact with people who have the conditions. People who are not vaccinated for either COVID-19 or flu may have a higher risk of developing the conditions. Similarly, people who do not take proper precautions, such as handwashing, wearing masks, avoiding sick people, or cleaning surfaces, may also have a higher risk. Finally, people who have weakened immune systems or preexisting conditions may have a higher chance of developing both flu and COVID-19. Possible complications of Flurona A person who has both flu and COVID-19 could develop complications from either condition. Some possible complications include:blood clotspneumoniamultiple organ failure, such as respiratory failure, kidney failure, or shocksepsisinflammation of the heart, brain, or muscle tissuesacute respiratory distress syndrome (fluid in the lungs)post-COVID-19 conditionscardiac injury (heart attack and stroke)worsening of preexisting chronic medical conditions multisystem inflammatory syndromesecondary infectionsWho is vulnerable?Several populations have a higher risk of developing complications from flu. Many of the same groups have a generally higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19. Some of the high risk groups are:people over 65young childrenpeople who are pregnantpeople living with preexisting conditions such as asthma, heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, HIV, or cancerpeople living with certain disabilitiesAccording to the CDC, people with Native American, African American, and Latin American ethnic backgrounds have an increased risk for hospitalization with flu. People from racial and ethnic minority groups also have a higher risk of dying from COVID-19 at younger ages. Healthcare inequities may be one reason for these disparities.Learn more about racial discrimination in healthcare.TreatmentThe severity of symptoms for both flu and COVID-19 can vary greatly, which means not all people will need to seek medical treatment.A person who experiences mild symptoms may find that using over-the-counter medications, such as Tylenol and Advil, and getting a lot of rest will help them manage their symptoms. However, if a person who develops symptoms of COVID-19 or flu is at a higher risk of complications, they should seek medical attention. If a person seeks treatment for Flurona, a doctor must determine that the person has both conditions. Scientists have not yet established an official protocol, but a doctor may prescribe antiviral medications to treat each condition. In severe cases, a doctor may recommend hospitalizing the person. In the hospital, the doctors will determine the best course of action to treat the person and help prevent serious complications.PreventionIt is not always possible to prevent flu or COVID-19. However, because the two viruses spread in similar ways, certain precautions can help reduce a person’s risk of contracting either one. These include:getting vaccinated for each conditionregularly washing hands and hard surfaceswearing a maskmaintaining a 6-foot distance from othersavoiding crowded areasstaying away from people who are sickPeople who are sick can help reduce the spread of either virus by staying home and resting as they recover.Summary“Flurona” is a term that some people use to describe having both flu and COVID-19 at the same time. It can be difficult to tell the two conditions apart because they have similar symptoms. Though the exact rate of occurrence is unknown, some studies have stated that Flurona is rare. A person should seek medical care if they experience flu-like symptoms and are part of a high risk group.A person should also seek medical attention if they develop severe flu-like symptoms or their symptoms are not going away. Treatment for both conditions may include over-the-counter medications, antiviral medications, or hospitalization.Flu / Cold / SARSCOVID-19FluHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

During its June 22-23 meeting, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made a preferential recommendation that such vaccines be used in patients 65 and older. It’s the first time the committee has made such a stipulation for this age group. The ACIP’s recommendation states that patients 65 and older should receive Fluad Quadrivalent, Flublok Quadrivalent or Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent. The committee did not indicate a preference for one particular high-dose vaccine. Pamela Rockwell, D.O., of Ann Arbor, Mich., the AAFP's liaison to the ACIP, said the committee made the recommendation based on evidence that high-dose, quadrivalent influenza vaccines are more effective in individuals 65 and older compared to standard trivalent flu vaccines. However, she noted that if none of the preferred high-dose vaccines are available, immunizing patients in this age group with any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine would be better than not vaccinating them at all. Patients 65 and older are at increased risk for severe illness, hospitalization and death due to influenza. According to the CDC, between 50% and 70% of flu-related hospitalizations and between 70% and 85% of flu-related deaths have occurred among patients in this age group in recent years. Story Highlights The ACIP’s recommendation is subject to review and approval by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, M.D., M.P.H. The agency’s approved final recommendations for seasonal flu vaccines are expected to be published in a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report later this summer. After publication, the AAFP will review the recommendations for possible approval. COVID Vaccines It has been a busy month for the ACIP, which also met June 17-18 specifically to take action on FDA approval of COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 6 months to 5 years. In its June 22-23 meeting, the ACIP took two votes after the FDA issued emergency use authorizations related to COVID vaccines for youths. The committee voted unanimously to recommend Moderna’s two-dose, 50 microgram COVID vaccine for children ages 6-11 years and also to recommend Moderna’s two-dose, 100 microgram COVID vaccine for adolescents ages 12-17. Children ages 6-17 who are moderately to severely immunocompromised should receive a third dose of vaccine 28 days after their second dose. The AAFP has approved the advisory committee’s recommendations regarding COVID immunizations, and the Academy’s COVID vaccine webpage has been updated with the latest recommendations related to the pandemic, as well as new resources that include a COVID-19 vaccination schedule. Two other ACIP recommendations from the June 22-23 meeting would give clinicians additional options for vaccinating patients against pneumococcal disease as well as measles, mumps and rubella. Those recommendations are expected to be part of the CDC’s 2023 immunization schedules and will be reviewed by the AAFP after final CDC approval. MMR The ACIP voted unanimously to recommend GSK’s Priorix, which was approved by the FDA earlier this month, for people ages 6 months and older. Previously, Merck, which produces M-M-R II and ProQuad, was the only manufacturer of MMR vaccines approved for use in the United States. Rockwell said the ACIP’s MMR work group presented evidence that redundancy in the U.S. supply chain was needed to protect public health following multiple interruptions to Merck’s manufacturing operations. Priorix, she said, has a similar safety profile and is considered noninferior to M-M-R II and should be beneficial in maintaining measles and rubella elimination and mitigating mumps outbreaks. It also offers a gelatin-free alternative to M-M-R II, which she said is important to some religious groups. Rockwell noted that Priorix already was considered fully interchangeable with M-M-R II in many countries. First licensed in Germany in 1997, the vaccine has been approved in more than 100 countries with more than 400 million doses distributed worldwide. Reported incidence of measles and mumps have declined dramatically during the pandemic, likely due in part to social distancing, masking and other COVID-19 mitigation efforts, Rockwell said. MMR vaccination rates also have declined during the pandemic, according to the CDC, leaving unvaccinated children potentially at risk when COVID mitigation efforts end. Parents may be tempted to avoid health care settings due to concerns about COVID-19, so Rockwell said reminders and outreach may be necessary. “Many children missed check-ups and recommended childhood vaccinations during the past two years,” she said. “Reminder and recall systems should be implemented to identify patients who are due for or who have missed vaccine doses. Reminders and recalls can be delivered in different ways, including telephone, letter, postcard or text message.” Rockwell said the vaccination status of all patients should be assessed at every health care visit to reduce missed opportunities for vaccination, and the use of standing orders may improve catch-up vaccination efficiency. Pneumococcal Disease The ACIP voted unanimously to recommend Vaxneuvance, Merck’s 15-valent pneumococcal vaccine that was approved by the FDA the same day for infants and children ages 6 weeks to 17 years. Vaxneuvance was deemed noninferior to Prevnar 13, Pfizer’s 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and either vaccine can be used in a four-dose series at ages 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months. Rockwell noted that the two vaccines have similar efficacies for the 13 serotypes covered by PCV13. In addition to covering two additional serotypes (22F and 33F), the PCV15 vaccine is expected to cost less, according to information presented during the meeting.

The CDC has influenza vaccine recommendations just for you By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published July 01, 2022 / Updated September 08, 2023 Getty Images Facebook Twitter LinkedIn ﻿A reminder just ahead of flu season: ﻿When you roll up your sleeve for the shot this year, skip the standard version and opt for one with more oomph. Since the summer of 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that adults 65 years and older get immunized with what’s known as a high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccine. These shots can offer greater protection to older people, who, due to immune system changes that happen with age, do not have as strong a response to vaccination as younger, healthier people. Older adults are more susceptible to complications from the flu. In fact, it’s estimated that between 70 and 85 percent of seasonal flu-related deaths and 50 to 70 percent of flu-related hospitalizations occur in people 65 and older. “Given their increased risk of flu-associated severe illness, hospitalization and death, it’s important to use these potentially more effective vaccines in people 65 years and older,” José R. Romero, M.D., director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a July 2022 statement when the recommendation was first made. The three available vaccines The more powerful flu shots have been available for several years. However, ﻿previous recommendations did not explicitly favor them over the standard flu vaccines, which help keep an influenza infection from progressing to a serious illness. “It was more of a soft recommendation,” says William Schaffner, M.D., a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.﻿ But data collected from studies over the years now shows that there’s “better protection for people ages 65 and older with one of these enhanced vaccines,” Schaffner says. “So basically, the signal has gone out to all the providers that [they need] to make an effort to stock these vaccines going forward for people aged 65 and older.” The CDC’s recommendation didn’t come with a preference for any one of the three enhanced vaccines on the market. Schaffner’s advice is to get the one that’s available. “Don’t be too picky,” he says. “They’re all really enhanced vaccines.” Just make sure you’re asking for one of the versions that is specifically recommended for older adults. Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent, an inactivated vaccine (meaning it uses the killed version of the germ that causes a disease) approved for people 65-plus, contains four times the antigen of standard-dose inactivated flu vaccines. Antigen is the part of the vaccine that helps your body build up protection against flu viruses, the CDC explains. Fluad Quadrivalent, also an inactivated vaccine approved for people 65 and older, has the same amount of antigen as the standard shots but contains an adjuvant, or an ingredient added to a vaccine that helps create a stronger immune response to vaccination. Flublok Quadrivalent, approved for people 18 and older, is made using a different vaccine technology (it’s a recombinant protein vaccine). AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Subscribe See All Newsletters Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT The high-dose and adjuvanted flu vaccines may result in more of the mild, temporary side effects that can occur with standard-dose seasonal flu shots, the CDC says. Expected side effects can include pain, redness or swelling at the injection site, headache, muscle ache and fatigue. These symptoms typically resolve within one to three days. Before the CDC’s recommendation, ﻿about 80 percent of Medicare beneficiaries were already receiving a higher-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccine, federal data shows. However, the CDC notes that racial and ethnic disparities existed. One study published in The Lancet Healthy Longevity found that minority groups were 26 to 32 percent less likely than whites to receive a high-dose flu vaccine. The CDC’s 2022 recommendation “could help reduce health disparities by making these vaccines more available to racial and ethnic minority groups,” Romero says. The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older be vaccinated each year against the flu. If you’re 65 or older and one of the enhanced vaccines is not available when you go to get your flu shot, get a standard-dose flu vaccine instead, the agency says. “When you’re 65 and older and you’re talking about influenza, you need all the help that you can get,” Schaffner says. “So I have a very strong message to absolutely everyone 65 and older: Better to be vaccinated than not.” ﻿﻿ Editor’s note: This article, originally published July 1, 2022, has been updated to reflect new information. %{postComment}% Rachel Nania is an award-winning health editor and writer at AARP.org, who covers a range of topics including diseases and treatments.

Staff set up a tent away from other birds where they can examine those with bird flu symptoms. (Katie Anastas/Alaska Public Media) The Bird Treatment and Learning Center in Anchorage is one of a few bird rehabilitation centers in the state still accepting birds as the avian flu circulates. Now, along with eagles with broken wings and orphaned baby ducks, the center — often called Bird TLC — is also getting birds infected with the highly pathogenic virus. Staff have set up a tent in the garage where they take birds that arrive with symptoms — anything from respiratory problems to severe neurological symptoms, like seizures. Some eagles have arrived with such bad tremors they’re unable to stand. “When they’re that far along in the disease, there’s no treatment,” said Dr. Karen Higgs. “So we provide humane euthanasia for them.” This strain of bird flu is extremely contagious and can spread from bird to bird through saliva or feces. Staff and volunteers at Bird TLC change their shoes and clothes constantly and wash them with bleach. They’ve placed tarps over the tops of cages to protect their birds from wild birds flying overhead. Higgs met with volunteers on Zoom to explain the new protocol. “It has taken what we thought would be a fun summer and turned it into quite a challenge,” Higgs said. Bird TLC has had a group of ducklings, an adult Canada goose and a bald eagle from Anchorage test positive for bird flu. They’ve also been sent eagles from Dutch Harbor and Valdez. “But it takes about two weeks for us to get test results, so we don’t know they’re positive until they’re gone,” Higgs said. Higgs said, thanks to their protocols, they haven’t had any spread of bird flu within the center. She said the fact that the first cases were detected in the Lower 48 gave them time to prepare. Several other centers in the state — like the Alaska Raptor Center in Sitka — temporarily stopped bird rescue and rehabilitation altogether as the bird flu spread. Bird TLC in Anchorage has put strict cleaning protocols in place to prevent the spread of bird flu. “We’re going through a lot of gloves,” said Dr. Karen Higgs. (Katie Anastas/Alaska Public Media) With the last major bird flu outbreak in 2014-2015, chickens and turkeys were hit the hardest. But this year, the new strain is also affecting eagles, geese, ducks and other wild birds. “This strain of this virus is very different, in the fact that it’s having very significant mortality in wild birds,” said state veterinarian Dr. Robert Gerlach. “We haven’t seen that in the past,” He said out of more than 210 dead birds the state has tested for bird flu, a quarter of them have tested positive. This outbreak also could last longer than the 2014-2015 one did. Gerlach said, that time, officials had stopped detecting cases by early July. Hot weather likely helped. But the fact that Alaska has wild birds testing positive could keep the flu spreading longer. “This state is colder and wetter than states in the Lower 48,” Gerlach said. “So will we see the virus leave or will we see it continue to circulate in the bird populations here through the summer? Because the big concern then is then, in the fall, when those birds fly south, will they be reintroducing this virus back into resident bird populations?” Gerlach said information from the public will be key to understanding bird flu as it continues to spread. People who see sick or injured birds can call the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s hotline at 866-527-3358. “Their hotline has just been ringing off the hook,” Gerlach said. “Normally they’d just have one person — now they have several people answering calls on there.” Higgs, at Bird TLC, said the widespread use of the hotline may have some unexpected benefits. She said they’ve had around 40 fewer birds brought in this spring than last spring. She hopes, maybe, people are seeking more advice before trying to help a bird that might not need it. “I think everybody, hopefully, gains an appreciation for seeing the wild birds out there, and people are watching them more closely,” she said. “But it’s been really hard. It’s hard on our volunteers, it’s hard on us, to see these birds so sick.” Higgs said, as long as it’s safe for the other birds in their care, Bird TLC will keep taking in sick birds and providing more data to the state.

Expert advice: View spring flu misery as reminder to remain viral vigilant minute read by Debra Melani | June 29, 2022 What you need to know: A flu outbreak during the warming days of spring kept doctors busy treating patients with the respiratory virus generally reserved for the winter months. But the late season was not exceptionally surprising for doctors whose jobs have not been normal since the pandemic hit. An unusually late surge in flu cases this spring should remind everyone that, as far as nasty viruses go, these are unprecedented times. Since the novel coronavirus joined the picture in 2020, what doctors see in their offices and hospital beds has continually bucked the norm. Now, as medical researchers ponder off-season rises in severe cases of everything from breath-stealing RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) to liver-destroying hepatitis in children, doctors urge COVID-weary Americans to keep their guards up. See related article on the recent authorization of COVID-19 vaccines for infants and preschoolers. “This was a very unusual, prolonged influenza season,” said Suchitra Rao, MD, a University of Colorado School of Medicine associate professor and pediatric infectious diseases specialist and hospitalist at Children’s Hospital Colorado. “We had to extend the period of time that people could get their flu shots.” Her advice: Keep family members up-to-date on all immunizations, including influenza and COVID-19 shots. With the recent emergency use authorization for the youngest age group, COVID-19 vaccine recommendations now cover all Americans 6 months and older. Below, Rao discussed how the pandemic has changed the course of some infectious diseases. Her interview was edited for length and clarity. What does Colorado’s flu season usually look like? Cases typically start around November and go through March. We usually see cases starting to fall off around April. But this year, we have been seeing influenza cases well into June, which is just something that we don’t normally see. The other thing that we usually see is influenza A circulating first, and then in the second half of the season, we’ll see influenza B activity. But we haven’t really had any influenza B activity, so that’s also really unusual. How has the pandemic influenced the flu’s more common behavior? The patterns of influenza have to do a lot with other viruses that are circulating. There is a concept called viral interference where one virus tends to dominate over a given period of time and keeps other viruses at bay. We think that viral interference from SARS-CoV-2 could be one theory as to why we saw an unusual season. When we had the early Omicron wave, there wasn’t a lot of influenza activity. Once Omicron went down, we saw influenza numbers really kick up. Now, after we had the next rise of the Omicron variant, we’re starting to see a steep decline in influenza cases. What is the southern hemisphere’s flu patterns telling us about what to expect for our fall/winter flu season? What we are seeing over there in their winter is a very nasty influenza season. They also had a slightly earlier flu season, and that is something we were really interested to know: Are we going to be having an early season that’s almost going to be colliding with this late season? And, again, it has been a more severe season for them, so that does not bode that well for us. What other infectious diseases are doctors across the country seeing that appear to be higher than usual? We have seen surges of all sorts of different viruses at unusual times. We have seen a lot of enterovirus and rhinovirus cases. Many children are getting admitted to the hospital with RSV bronchiolitis, something that we typically see more in the winter months. There has been an increase of adenovirus cases, both the kind that cause respiratory illness as well as the kind that can cause gastrointestinal and liver issues. There was recently an outbreak of unexplained liver disease in kids, and a lot of those cases are potentially linked to the adenovirus 41 strain. What other theories besides viral interference are there when it comes to these changing patterns and new viral outbreaks? For some of the cases where we are seeing new pathogens emerging that we haven’t encountered before (e.g. monkeypox), there are theories about changing climate and what might have normally remained circulating within animal hosts are now getting into human hosts. For these unusual patterns of upper-respiratory viruses (e.g., RSV, influenza), one theory is that we did have a lot of human behavior changes at the time of the pandemic, when we were in lockdown and doing a lot of community mitigation. That kept all of the viruses at bay. And now that we have reopened society and we are mingling and are close to all normal activities, we are starting to see a resurgence of these other respiratory viruses. Many of the infectious disease anomalies are affecting children. Can you talk about that? Yes, there could be some immunity aspects to it as well, especially for young children. Normally, in the first year or two of life, kids encounter a lot of these pathogens, and then they gain immunity. So the next time they contract a disease, it might not be as severe. There certainly now has been this shift where young children during the pandemic do not have that immune memory. That might translate to more severe disease in a 2- or 3-year-old, versus if they had encountered it when they were younger. Is there anything else you would like to add? I think that seeing this unusual flu activity is a good reminder that there are things that we can do to still protect ourselves, including handwashing, staying home when sick and getting the recommended vaccines during the time they are recommended, which can help to prevent the severe outcomes.

NIH-funded research yields promising results for potential universal flu vaccinesBy Greg Slabodkin, ScienceBoard Editor in Chief July 1, 2022 -- A study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has shown that a new universal flu vaccine offers broad protection against different strains and subtypes of influenza A virus infections. Researchers from the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State University (GSU) developed the universal flu vaccine by genetically linking two highly conserved portions of the virus -- the extracellular domain of matrix 2 (M2e) and the stalk protein found in influenza A H3N2 viruses. Their published findings in the journal npj Vaccines showed that M2e-stalk protein vaccination induced broad protection against different influenza virus strains and subtypes by universal vaccine-mediated immunity in adult and aged mice. "The M2e-stalk protein, for the first time, could be easily produced in bacterial cell cultures at high yields and was found to confer protection against heterologous and heterosubtypic cross-group subtype viruses (H1N1, H5N1, H9N2, H3N2, and H7N9) at similar levels in adult and aged mice," said Sang-Moo Kang, PhD, senior author of the study and a professor at the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at GSU, in a written statement. Kang said the study's results "provide evidence that M2e-stalk genetic fusion proteins can be produced in a large scale at low cost and developed as a universal influenza A virus vaccine candidate for young and aged populations." In separate but related news this week, NIH announced that a phase I clinical trial of a novel influenza vaccine has begun inoculating healthy adult volunteers at the agency's Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The single-site, placebo-controlled trial will test the safety of a candidate vaccine, developed by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and its ability to prompt immune responses in up to 100 people between the ages of 18 and 55. The candidate vaccine, BPL-1357, is a whole-virus vaccine made up of four strains of non-infectious, chemically inactivated, low-pathogenicity avian flu virus. An animal study, led by NIAID investigator Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, PhD, and posted online as a preprint, found that all mice receiving two doses of BPL-1357 vaccine delivered either intramuscularly or intranasally survived later exposure to lethal doses of each of six different influenza virus strains, including subtypes that were not included in the vaccine. NIH reports that similar results were obtained in challenge experiments in which ferrets were vaccinated with BPL-1357.If you like this content, please share it with a colleague!

A dead Common Tern on Maine’s Stratton Island is a victim of a possible avian influenza outbreak. Photo: Michael Rickershauser By Alex Tey Reporter, Audubon Magazine Published June 28, 2022 Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect new positive test results from terns in Maine, the first confirmed cases of avian flu at seabird colonies on the East Coast of the United States. Seabird colonies on both sides of the Atlantic have been devastated by avian flu outbreaks in recent weeks. Thousands of Northern Gannets have died at nesting sites in Europe and Canada, their carcasses washing up on the shores of the Maritime Provinces and the British Isles. On St. Kilda, Scotland, avian flu threatens to strain the Great Skua population. In the Netherlands, an entire colony of Sandwich Terns was wiped out. And on Wednesday Audubon learned of the first confirmed cases of avian flu at Atlantic seabird colonies in the United States after a string of tern deaths at breeding sites in Maine. The results indicate that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) that ravaged wild birds across the country this spring has arrived in New England’s dense seabird colonies. This breeding season, researchers at Pond Island and Stratton Island have been finding one to two dead Common Terns every day—with no signs of predation, injury, or starvation. Don Lyons, the conservation science director for Audubon’s Seabird Institute, noted that some death is normal at these colonies. However, certain signs pointed to HPAI: At least two of the victims had been seen compulsively shaking their heads, a symptom of neurological issues associated with avian influenza. Reports of potentially sick birds not flushing when approached are also troubling. “This suggests that HPAI is present at more than one of our islands, and one can logically speculate that it is likely present, or will be soon, at all of our islands with nesting terns,” Lyons wrote in a follow-up email. The new test results confirm that the disease is present at at least one of those sites: All four Common Terns from Pond Island sent to a lab tested positive for HPAI, according to Lyons. Common Terns and Arctic Terns from other islands tested negative. Scientists have been tracking the current strain of HPAI in North America since December 2021, when the first case was detected in Canada. It remains unclear exactly how the pathogen arrived on the continent, but genetic analysis has shown that the North American strain is descended directly from the European strain. “Based on the experience that the European countries have had, it looks like it's not necessarily going to slow down anytime soon,” says Samantha Gibbs, the lead wildlife veterinarian at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “They’ve been dealing with it for a couple of years now at least, and it’s not just going away.” Terns around the world have been among the hardest-hit species in recent outbreaks. More than 1,000 Caspian Terns on Wisconsin’s Lake Michigan coast have died since late May, with testing identifying HPAI as the cause. In the Netherlands, where the current European strain has been circulating since 2016, the virus’s impact on Sandwich Terns has been catastrophic. Thousands of terns across multiple colonies have been killed this breeding season, with one colony of more than 7,000 birds being completely wiped out earlier this month. Hundreds more have died at the country’s largest nesting colony. A research site in Germany, meanwhile, is documenting an exponential spike in deaths during an ongoing outbreak at the Banter See that has killed hundreds of Common Terns. What heartbreak looks like. We just brought a second freezer to the Banter See, because the first one is nearly full. 225 dead birds at the end of yesterday. More today. #H5N1 #avianinfluenza #fieldwork #seabirds #ornithology pic.twitter.com/BvJufh5bIo — Common Tern Project (@CommonTerns) June 20, 2022 So far, there has been no such increase in mortality rates with the Maine Common Terns that Lyons studies. But these reports are still worrying for seabird researchers. “The fact that terns can be so severely impacted has us really concerned,” he says. Because Common Terns frequently move around between colonies, Lyons says that an influenza outbreak at one colony would quickly spread to others. An HPAI outbreak in Maine could spell catastrophe for nearby colony-nesting seabirds like Atlantic Puffins, Arctic Terns, and Least Terns. Lyons is particularly worried about Roseate Terns—this species, which is endangered in the Northeast, shares nesting colonies with Common Terns. Seabirds’ dense colonies make them particularly vulnerable to fast-spreading diseases like avian flu. Lyons and his team are also keeping a close eye on Atlantic Puffins, whose historic Maine populations were reestablished in the late 1970s by Steve Kress, the founder of Project Puffin and former executive director of Audubon’s Seabird Restoration Program. “It appears that puffins are susceptible, like pretty much all species—I haven’t heard of anything that is likely resistant,” Lyons says. Seabirds’ dense nesting colonies make them particularly vulnerable to fast-spreading diseases like avian flu. “If you drop a virus into a high-density population, transmission risk is amplified,” says Bryan Richards, emerging disease coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Wildlife Health Center. Lyons hopes that a sort of avian social distancing would lessen the impact of avian flu on the Maine tern colonies. The species most heavily affected elsewhere breed in extremely close quarters, even for seabirds—Sandwich Terns nest, on average, only a foot apart. Common and Roseate Tern nests, on the other hand, average about three feet of separation. But like many things about HPAI, scientists don’t know how this will actually turn out. “We’re facing kind of an evolving threat, and it just doesn’t seem very predictable at the moment,” Lyons says. One worrying unknown is the effect an outbreak might have on a species’ overall population. Terns have relatively long lifespans—the oldest recorded Common Tern was at least 25 years old. This strategy offers advantages during years of bad weather or low food supply, but an influenza outbreak could make its risks evident. “They can't raise a lot of young in a given year, so when adults are dying, we really worry about the population overall,” Lyons says. Matters are only made worse by the fact that scientists are helpless to treat sick birds. Instead, they say that the best way to support bird populations during avian flu outbreaks is to reduce outside stressors. “We can't really alter disease outcomes to a great extent in wild birds—the virus is going to do what it’s going to do,” Richards says. He thinks the best way to make a difference is by enabling populations to recover. While a healthy, resilient population can withstand disturbances from disease, Gibbs adds, a population stressed by factors like habitat loss, decreased food supply, or pollution will have a harder time rebounding. “It’s a whole intricate and complex system, all of which needs our care and attention,” she says.

Smith | Milwaukee Journal SentinelThe spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) across North America in 2022 has taken an unprecedented toll on wild birds, according to federal data.Already the number of birds dead from the virus is more than 10 times greater than documented in any other avian flu outbreak.But as with many wildlife diseases, the impacts of HPAI are difficult to assess as wild birds often disperse and die never to be found.A sobering exception was discovered in early June by researchers visiting Caspian tern breeding sites in Wisconsin.Where they expected to find colonies of the state endangered bird brooding eggs, they instead saw windrows of dead adults.The two islands off Door County — Gravel Island and Hat Island — had 1,221 dead Caspian terns.Many other birds were nearly dead and displayed neurological impairment including head tremors, head tilting, loss of coordination and were unable to walk or fly properly, according to a report by Sadie Odell of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.The symptoms are consistent with HPAI.One adult tern on Gravel Island was observed in an incubating posture next to a nest and unable to move, said Sumner Matteson, avian ecologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, of his June 2 visit to the site.Nearby a Herring gull chick sought shelter under the shade of a dead tern.The dead Caspian terns on the islands represent the loss of at least 64% of Wisconsin's breeding population of the species, according to Matteson."Just devastating," Matteson said. "The most horrific thing I've witnessed in my 42 years doing bird work."Lesser numbers of dead double-crested cormorants and Herring gulls were also seen on the islands.Necropsies on seven Caspian terns and two cormorants from the islands were conducted at the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison.All of the submitted birds from both islands were positive for HPAI, said Nancy Businga, DNR wildlife disease specialist.The case highlights how significantly the virus can impact wild birds.The 2021-22 outbreak of avian flu in North America is already the worst in seven years among U.S. domestic flocks and the deadliest ever documented among America's wild birds, including raptors and waterfowl.The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain, called EA H5N1, has been circulating since late 2021. It had been detected in 42 states as of June 24, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.So far 40.1 million domestic birds have died in the outbreak, mostly through depopulations at infected poultry farms, according to federal figures.It's the biggest since 2015 when HPAI subtype H5N2 affected about 49 million domestic birds. At a cost of $1 billion, the outbreak was the most costly animal health emergency in U.S. history, according to the USDA.In the last major avian flu outbreak, 98 HPAI-positive wild birds were detected between December 2014 and June 2015, according to the USDA. Most were hunter-harvested waterfowl from the Pacific Flyway.That number has spiked to 1,585 among wild birds in the current outbreak, according to USDA figures released June 24.But as evidenced by the Caspian tern findings in Wisconsin, the number of dead wild birds in the federal report vastly underrepresents the toll of the disease.The global spread of avian flu is driven in large part by migratory waterfowl, according to the USDA. Knowledge about migratory patterns and intercontinental associations of waterfowl, as well as genetic analyses of viral strains, supported the hypothesis that previous HPAI outbreaks entered North America from Asia via migratory birds. Wild waterfowl and other species shed the virus into the environment through their oral and nasal secretions and feces.Scavenging and predatory species can also pick up the virus by feeding on infected dead or live birds.The disease has affected dozens of species, including bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, Canada geese, lesser scaup and American white pelicans.Songbirds appear to be relatively unaffected.But many researchers are concerned about the impact the disease will have on wild bird reproduction and recruitment this year. Madison Audubon has conducted a Bald Eagle Nest Watch program since 2018 in Wisconsin. The citizen-science effort includes frequent monitoring of eagle nests from the mating season in winter through fledging in spring and summer.From 2018-21, the program recorded 28 eagle nest failures on 187 nests observed, or 15%. The annual failure rates ranged from 9% to 28%.This year the failure rate has spiked to 46% on 145 monitored nests, according to data provided by program organizer Drew Cashman.Eagles in the Fox River Valley fared worse than other areas in the study. Nest failures there reached 71% (17 of 24).Dead chicks were not tested for disease and it's not possible to attribute all the failures to HPAI. But in one case, an adult eagle in Milwaukee County found unable to fly near a nest and later euthanized tested positive for HPAI.Colonial nesting waterbirds are being hit hard by the disease. Among the Wisconsin death toll attributed to HPAI are 1,143 dead double-crested cormorants, 106 American white pelicans and 71 Herring gulls, according to data provided by Matteson.The tally includes 202 dead cormorants and 43 pelicans at Horicon National Wildlife Refuge near Horicon.It's not clear why Caspian terns have died at even higher rates than the others.A researcher in Michigan found similar devastation as to what occurred at the Wisconsin islands. Caspian tern colonies were "wiped out" on Bellow Island in Grand Traverse Bay with 255 dead adults, according to a Michigan Radio report.Conversely, common terns in the region are faring much better, Matteson said. It's possible differences in the migration patterns and habits of the two species will provide answers. For now Matteson said he and the other researchers were left with an overwhelming feeling of helplessness.Caspian terns can live to 30 years of age and don't breed until they are 3. The disease has not only killed a significant number of the adult breeding population this year but will likely result in very few, if any, chicks that survive.Matteson said it will likely take decades for the Caspian tern population to recover from this year's die-off."I've seen a lot in my career, but this is the worst," Matteson said. "It's absolutely catastrophic."Researchers remain hopeful that, similar to previous HPAI subtypes, the virus will dissipate this summer and not spark another outbreak.

With a recent outbreak of influenza in China, doctors warn of dual health risks from influenza and sporadic Covid, as reported by the Global Times. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention has issued a report on similarities and differences between influenza and Covid for clarity.“Among the 507 influenza outbreak... in 17 provinces between April 4 and June 19, 503 were in southern China, a sharp increase from the 136 in 2021 in the same period,” the latest report by the Chinese National Influenza Center (CNIC) said, according to the Global Times report. An influenza outbreak is defined as 10 or more cases.“Driven by huge demand, influenza antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir are in short supply in many pharmacies of southern China,” the news report added.Also Read: Need rescue on the sea? This Spanish city will charge you for itAccording to CDC, you cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 just by looking at the symptoms alone because they have some of the same symptoms. That’s why testing is needed to tell what the illness is and to confirm a diagnosis. Testing is also important because it can reveal if someone has both the flu and COVID-19 at the same time.“The Xiamen (city) health commission in Fujian suggested (paediatricians) to not get involved with Covid-19 related work so as to better deal with the influenza high season among children,” the news report said.Health officials in other provinces too have issued “alerts over the high prevalence of influenza and hospitals (have) adjusted measures to avoid crowded line-up and concentrated presence in public places,” it added.(with inputs from agencies) WATCH WION LIVE HEREYou can now write for wionews.com and be a part of the community.

Jane Barlow - PA Images / Contributor via Getty Images The latest avian flu outbreak, which has led to the deaths of millions of domestic birds in the United States, has spread to wild seabird colonies in the United Kingdom. At least a thousand northern gannets in the world’s largest colony of such birds, in Scotland, have died from the illness. Avian flu has also spread to wild birds in Norfolk and the Farne Islands in England. Seabirds already face multiple human-generated threats, including climate change, habitat destruction, prey shortages, invasive species, mortality in fishing gear and poorly sited wind turbines, Paul Walton, from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), says in a Natural History Museum statement. “Now, a highly mutable form of avian influenza, which originated in poultry, is killing our wild seabirds in large numbers,” he tells the museum. “We urge the U.K.'s governments to develop a response plan urgently—to coordinate surveillance and testing, disturbance minimization, carcass disposal and biosecurity.” Seabirds are particularly vulnerable because they are long-lived with low reproductive rates, so even after the outbreak ends, the birds may take a while to recover, reports New Scientist’s Adam Vaughan. Many also nest closely to one another, increasing the chance that disease will spread. “All seabirds have some type of influenza at some point in their life, and it's not that uncommon,” principal curator and curator in charge of birds at the Natural History Museum Alex Bond says in the statement. “This outbreak has become notable because of its large geographic spread and significant chick mortality. It's not just seabirds which are being affected either, but also waterfowl, waders and other birds which live in close proximity to one another.” About eight million seabirds from 25 species call Britain and Ireland home, including 90 percent of the world’s manx shearwaters, 68 percent of northern gannets and 60 percent of great skuas. The Bass Rock houses over 150,000 gannets—a large seabird native to both sides of the Atlantic coast—in peak season. The Farne Islands, which sit off the coast of Northumberland, England, announced a closure to visitors starting July 3 to reduce the risk of disturbance to the birds that live there. "While we have no confirmed test results from the islands, we are now starting to see the terribly sad and distressing impact of avian influenza on our internationally important and threatened seabirds who make the islands their home,” per the announcement. “Seabirds such as Arctic terns nesting in dense colonies, most of which are already in decline in the U.K., are particularly vulnerable now as they have returned to the islands in their thousands to breed, nesting in close proximity to each other.” Some Scottish islands have also closed to the public due to the outbreak: the Isle of May and Noss National Nature Reserves in Fife and the Isle of Noss in Shetland. The avian influenza spreading in poultry and wild birds in the U.K. is an H5N1 subtype virus, which generally is confined to birds but has spilled over from time-to-time to humans. Human vaccines for the virus already exist and have been stockpiled by various governments. The risk this bird flu poses to humans is low right now, with only two cases reported since October, Nature's Brittney J. Miller reported last month. But a mutation could make the virus more transmissible. “These viruses are like ticking time bombs,” Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organization, tells Nature. “Occasional infections are not an issue—it’s the gradual gaining of function of these viruses.” Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.

A new study compares the rates of onset of several types of neurological illness, whether degenerative, stroke-related or immunological, after COVID-19 or other respiratory infections. Study: Frequency of Neurological Diseases After COVID-19, Influenza A/B and Bacterial Pneumonia. Image Credit: Andrii Vodolazhskyi/Shutterstock Introduction Over 80% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized with the diagnosis have reported neurological symptoms, the most common being headache and anosmia. An increased clotting tendency also exists, and strokes have been described to happen as a complication. Some patients have developed neuropathies such as Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) or Parkinson’s disease (PD). This led to the question as to whether COVID-19 actually increased the risk of neurodegenerative or post-infectious neurological disease. The current paper, published online in the journal Frontiers in Neurology, examined electronic health records (EHR) for approximately half the population of Denmark, looking for people with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, in the period from February 2020 to November 2021. The researchers also included people tested for the flu between February 2018 and November 2019. Findings Of over 900,000 people with a history of COVID-19 testing, over 43,000 tested positive. During the same period, approximately 1,500 people had bacterial pneumonia. Thirdly, during the study period, over 8,000 had influenza. The group of individuals with COVID-19, whether hospitalized or not, had higher rates of COVID-19 risk factors, such as high cholesterol levels, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, than those hospitalized with the flu. Obesity was more common in COVID-19-positive individuals, or those hospitalized with influenza, and have a history of transient ischemic attacks (TIA). The latter was more likely among pneumonia inpatients as well, as was smoking, which was also more common among influenza inpatients. Delirium, which is known to be a risk factor for dementia, was more common among COVID-19 patients, at double the frequency among non-COVID-19 patients. The risk of hemorrhage into the brain was 5 times higher for outpatients with a history of COVID-19. Against this, it must be remembered that intravenous thrombolysis was seven times more common in this group, at 0.14%. Even after accounting for this risk factor, the risk continued to be over four-fold higher. Related StoriesOne in four healthy young Marines report long-term physical, cognitive, or psychiatric effects after mild COVID-19Canada’s proactive policies reduce drug shortages far more effectively than the U.S.Masks and smart seating cut COVID-19 risks on flights, review findsAlzheimer’s disease (AD) risk increased by 3.5 times, up to a year later. This was the case even after excluding cases with delirium and those who were at risk for stroke, both of which are independent risk factors for AD. The risk of Parkinson’s disease and ischemic stroke were almost 3-fold higher at up to 12 months in those with a diagnosis of COVID-19. However, this was brought into perspective when compared with the rates of the same conditions among individuals who had been hospitalized with influenza or bacterial pneumonia, who showed equivalent rates of both AD and PD. In this situation, the risk of stroke was almost twice as high among COVID-19 outpatients (but not combined in- and out-patients, or inpatients alone), compared to those without COVID-19, once stroke risk factors were compensated for. This risk was not seen at one month, but began to become obvious from 3 months post-COVID-19. The increase in risk was highest among patients aged 40-59 years, younger than the typical at-risk group for ischemic strokes. Compared to those with influenza, COVID-19 inpatients also showed a 70% increase in the stroke risk up to 6 months later, diminishing to 30% at one year. When stroke risk factors were accounted for, the risk was found to be tripled or higher in COVID-19 inpatients, even at one year. Moreover, when compared to inpatients with bacterial pneumonia who were over 80 years of age, the risk was almost 3 times higher among COVID-19 inpatients, but no overall increase in risk was found after accounting for the stroke risk factors. There was no observable difference in the rates of post-infectious neuropathies or neurodegenerative disease among those with or without a history of any of these infectious conditions. Implications The results of this study indicate a causative role of neuroinflammation, tiredness and negative emotions in COVID-19 patients that may have contributed to the higher incidence of AD and PD at one year from the initial diagnosis. Young patients who died of COVID-19 have been found to have abnormally elevated concentrations of the pathological protein β-amyloid in their brains. Against this must be set the higher attention paid to patients with a history of COVID-19, which may have led to an earlier and more frequent diagnosis of these conditions in their later history, compared to COVID-19-negative patients. However, AD and PD rates were comparable to those found after hospitalization with influenza or bacterial pneumonia. In contrast, there was an increased incidence of ischemic stroke among COVID-19 patients compared to those with a history of influenza or bacterial pneumonia. The explanations may include the inflammatory state, the cardiac involvement leading to cardiac embolism, immobilization during the hospital stay, or some unique characteristic of this infection. The incidence of intracerebral bleeds was more common at one month among COVID-19 outpatients, compared to individuals without COVID-19, but comparable to that found after prior influenza or bacterial pneumonia. Risk factors include anticoagulant therapy, mechanical ventilation, and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Even after compensating for thrombolysis, the risk of hemorrhage remained elevated, showing that COVID-19 itself posed a risk factor. The findings here suggest that patients with a history of respiratory infections should be monitored for neurodegenerative disorders, and that ischemic stroke appears to be a risk peculiar to COVID-19. Further studies will be required to validate this hypothesis. Journal reference: Zarifkar, P. et al. (2022). Frequency of Neurological Diseases After COVID-19, Influenza A/B and Bacterial Pneumonia.

(Leah Hennel/Alberta Health Services)Social SharingAlberta could be in for a particularly rough flu season this fall, and coupled with another potential surge in COVID-19 cases, it's causing doctors some concern.Infectious disease experts often look at trends in the southern hemisphere to predict what the Canadian influenza season will be like. So far, Australia is being hit hard.Its flu season started early, and lab confirmed case counts are higher than the five-year average."The concern is we're going to have what we call a 'bad influenza season,' which results in a lot of hospitalizations. And in addition to that, we've got an unknown situation that's going to occur with COVID at the same time," said Dr. Dan Gregson, an infectious disease physician, medical microbiologist and associate professor at the University of Calgary's Cumming School of Medicine.Dr. Daniel Gregson is an infectious disease physician and medical microbiologist with the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary. (CBC)"If our COVID admissions are up at the same time as we have a larger than usual influenza outbreak, our hospital capacity would be stretched a little bit thin again."Alberta didn't report any influenza cases during the 2020-21 season.But with the elimination of pandemic-related public health measures, Alberta has seen a resurgence of respiratory viruses and an unusually late flu season this year.This is due to a phenomenon known as immunity debt, explained Dr. Stephanie Smith, University of Alberta Hospital infectious disease physician."Essentially we haven't been exposed to so many of these viruses for really almost two years now. So our antibodies have waned and all of the sudden you're exposed and you really don't have that kind of extra layer of protection. So people are going to be more susceptible to a variety of infections."Pediatric hospitals strained All this comes at a time when Alberta hospitals are under extreme pressure due to a number of factors, including staffing shortages."I'm a little more fixated on where we're at right now," said Dr. Stephen Freedman, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Calgary and an ER physician at Alberta Children's Hospital."The emergency departments right now in Alberta and across Canada, especially the pediatric emergency departments, are extremely busy and doing our best to cope with volumes and acuity of illness that we're currently seeing." Is Alberta in for a summer COVID-19 surge? Scientists say an uptick likely within months Concerns grow as ER wait times at Alberta's pediatric hospitals balloon While Freedman is still treating a lot of kids for COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza, he said the numbers are easing and he's hoping for a further drop in viral illnesses in the coming weeks.However, he expects that decline will be countered by an uptick in COVID-19 cases driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 variants."I think we'll start to see that here probably just as some of those other viruses are tapering off. And then at some point in time we probably will see a surge in flu cases akin to what is being seen in Australia," Freedman said."It's just all a matter of timing and how those things overlap that will determine and dictate the severity of the upcoming viral respiratory season that we're going to see."Dr. Stephen Freedman is a professor of pediatrics and emergency medicine at the University of Calgary. (Riley Brandt/University of Calgary)In an effort to protect the healthcare system in the fall, Gregson said a number of key steps should to be taken, including messaging from government that masks may be needed if hospitals are at risk of becoming overwhelmed."The best we can do is prepare for it," he said."And make plans for, number one, trying to reduce the people who are going to need hospitalization and really ramp up our influenza immunization campaigns [and] ramp up our COVID boosting at the same time for people who are eligible."Alberta's flu vaccine uptake is traditionally quite low and Freedman agrees a strong immunization campaign should be a priority. Alberta hospitals turn to travel nurses as staffing shortages continue Diversion of emergency surgery patients a growing problem, Alberta doctors warn "One of the most important things that we need to do, and probably more so than prior years, is to really promote vaccination and ensure that children who are eligible get vaccinated," he said.Freedman is urging Albertans to continue with health practices such as staying home when they're sick.And, he said, work needs to be done to ensure there are enough healthcare staff in hospitals to deal with another potential onslaught of patients this fall."We continue to deal with short staffing due to individuals being sick as well as ... there's burnout in frontline healthcare staff for sure. So we need to make sure that those resources are in place, bolstered and ready to go."ABOUT THE AUTHORJennifer LeeReporterJennifer Lee is a CBC News reporter based in Calgary.

Alberto Ortega/Europa Press via Getty ImagesWorldwide, there are more than 55 million people living with Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias and 10 million new cases every year, according to the World Health Organization.Vaccines are increasingly being investigated as a potential tool for reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer’s. A recent study has shown the flu vaccine could reduce this risk by 40% but the mechanism remains unclear. Despite rapidly rising cases of Alzheimer’s disease, determining why some people develop this form of dementia and others don’t has remained elusive. The risk factors, according to research, are multifactorial with genetics, lifestyle and our environment all potentially playing a role. One area that has not received much attention until fairly recently is how our immune system might affect our risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Research in recent years has shown that receipt of some vaccines including BCG, a tuberculosis vaccine, and the chicken pox/shingles vaccine could lead to a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers have now found that the flu vaccine may have a protective effect, but it is not clear whether the vaccines themselves have an effect on risk, or whether preventing an infection does.These results are published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease.Investigating the linkBased on previous studies that suggest flu vaccines reduce the risk of dementia, a team from The University of Texas Health Science Center in Housten, Texas, sought to investigate the link between flu vaccines and the risk of Alzheimer’s-specific dementia.Using existing claims data from patients ages 65 years or over and free of dementia during the 6-year look-back period, they created two groups, each consisting of 935,887 patients. The first group had received the flu vaccine while the second group had not. The groups were matched with regard to baseline demographics, medications and comorbidities.The study showed that patients who received at least one flu vaccine were 40% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease over the 4-year follow-up period, than those who had not received the vaccine. The risk was lowest in patients who had received a flu vaccine every year over the 6-year look-back period.The researchers used a look-back period of 6 years as previous research has shown that at least six flu vaccines are needed to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, lead author Dr. Avram Bukhbinder told Medical News Today. He said they had reanalyzed their data to look at the effect over 4, 6, and 8 years.“Influenza vaccination had a similar effect on Alzheimer’s risk when the look-back period was lengthened from 4 years to 8 years,” he explained. “Prior studies of patients with serious chronic illnesses (such as chronic kidney disease) and of veterans have found an association between influenza vaccination and risk of dementia, so I wasn’t too surprised to find a similar result in this broader population of older adults in the U.S.,” he added. His views were echoed by Dr. Nicola Veronese, senior researcher in geriatrics and internal medicine at the University of Palermo, Italy who conducted a meta-analysis of five studies that had looked at the role of flu vaccination in Alzheimer’s risk, last year. He told MNT in an interview that the paper was confirmatory of previous research and praised the size of the cohort used. “[I] believe that this paper was confirmatory, [as a] teacher speaking,[it] was extremely well done. [T]his topic could encourage further direct evidence regarding the role of influenza vaccinations in diseases and dementia in general,” he said.A yet elusive mechanismIt is, however, too early to recommend getting the flu vaccine to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, said Dr. Heather M. Snyder, Alzheimer’s Association vice president of medical and scientific relations.“More research is needed to understand the biological mechanisms behind the results in this study. For example, it is possible that people who are getting vaccinated also take better care of their health in other ways, and these things add up to a lower risk of Alzheimer’s and other dementias.”— Dr. Heather M. Snyder“It is also possible that there are issues related to unequal access and/or vaccine hesitancy and how this may influence the study population and the research results,” she added.The authors propose that flu vaccines could have an impact on our innate immune system.They explain that flu vaccination and some other vaccines “are associated with non-specific protective effects via long-term reprogramming of innate immune cells.” This could have an effect on how the body clears the substance that builds up in the brain causing Alzheimer’s or inflammatory responses.They also suggest there is a potential interaction between the adaptive immune system and vaccination that is age-related, which is one possible explanation for the findings. Dr. Veronese described this assertation as “more theoretical than practical.”“We don’t have any direct evidence supporting the modification in adaptive secondaries or a primary immune system,” he added.

What's the cause?Shawn P. Sullivan | Portsmouth HeraldShow Caption Hide Caption 5 things to know to stop the spread of bird fluHere are five things to know from the CDC on how to protect against highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or bird flu.Lauren Roberts, Salisbury Daily TimesKENNEBUNKPORT, Maine — The town is urging residents to keep their distance if they come across any birds and ducks that appear ill or are acting irregularly.Currently, Kennebunkport is confirmed as an area where Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza is present. Members of the public recently have reported sightings of dead birds and of ducks that have been behaving strangely on Goose Rocks Beach.“The National Wildlife Disease Program does not recommend handling live or deceased wildlife,” the town stated in a press release on June 24. “These birds should not be captured and taken to local rehabilitators.”Even though the reported birds have not been confirmed as victims of the avian flu, they should be regarded as such and treated accordingly, the town added.Maine blueberries on a pizza?: Absolutely! New restaurant and brewery opening in OgunquitWhat are communities doing about birds?Town officials are working with state and federal officials to address the issue and will update the public once more information becomes available.Kennebunkport is not alone. According to Brad Allen, a marine biologist with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, there have been several cases of sick or dead birds along a “broad swatch of coastal Maine.”Last week, for example, Shannon Silverson, a resident of Peaks Island, located a few miles off the coast of Portland, told WGME-TV that she noticed as many as 30 dead and dying birds in her area, according to the Associated Press.“It was just a dreadful feeling,” Silverson said.'Whimsical, magical': Hobbit House sold in southern Maine: Here's the story behind it.Also last week, hundreds of dead aquatic birds washed up on the shores of Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts, according to AP.“For whatever reason – we’re still trying to figure out why – birds are dying and drifting onto our beaches,” Allen said on Tuesday morning. “The smoking gun now appears to be avian influenza.”Bird flu concerns: Hundreds of dead cormorants wash up on Martha's Vineyard beachesWhat is bird flu impact?According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, avian influenza, or “bird flu,” as it is commonly called, is a respiratory disease that results when a bird is infected with Type A viruses.“These viruses naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species,” the CDC states on its website.Bird flu can spread amongst humans, but is very rareWhile bird flu is rarely seen in humans, it shares many of the same symptoms as the regular flu.Damien Henderson, Getty ImagesCan humans get bird flu?Bird-flu viruses do not normally infect humans, but sporadic cases in individuals have occurred, according to the CDC – a fact the town mentioned in its press release.“People who have regular contact with poultry or wild birds are most at risk,” the town stated.Infected birds carry the avian flu virus in their saliva, mucus and feces, according to the Maine CDC.“Humans can have contact with avian flu virus when a person touches a surface with virus on it, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. The virus can also be inhaled from droplets or dust in the air,” the state’s CDC says on its website.Bird flu: Here's what it is, what to know about its symptomsSince avian flu can cause severe symptoms in some individuals, monitoring for human infection and preventing the spread of the virus is important, the Maine CDC adds.Symptoms in people often include a cough, a headache, a sore throat, shortness of breath, fever or chills, fatigue, congestion or a runny nose, and aches, according to the Maine CDC.Allen said signs of the avian flu surfaced in the state this past winter. Fatalities since February have claimed birds both small and large, including bald eagles.What happens when dead birds are found?Dead birds are tested, and when the results come back negative for the avian flu, that prompts questions, Allen said.“If a test comes back negative, we have to dig a little deeper and see if there are other mortality causes,” he said.Allen reiterated people on public property should not approach or touch dead or dying birds and instead should contact town officials – such as an animal control officer – who are trained to handle such situations.In a press release, the state said homeowners can remove dead birds on their private land or beach at their discretion. Such individuals are encouraged to wear a mask and gloves while addressing the issue.“The dead bird should be buried or can be bagged and placed into the trash,” the state said in its press release. “Sick-acting birds should be left alone.”Even the adorable ones.“It’s a tough message, especially when it comes to the ducklings,” Allen said.And if a dead eagle is found? Please call Maine Police dispatch at (207) 624-7076.“We don’t want people to spread this virus further,” Allen said.Allen expressed hope that last week’s incidents prove the peak of the situation.“I’m hoping it’s running its course,” he said.

Key points:More than 700 flu patients have been admitted to Northern Territory hospitals this yearStrained emergency departments are battling a bottleneck of patients with various health conditionsThe NT government is facing renewed calls to offer free flu vaccinationsData from NT Health shows the territory has nearly doubled its recent flu records, with 3,210 cases recorded so far this year — up from 1,878 in 2019. More than 1,000 of those cases have been reported in the past month.It's a concerning trend that is dumping more pressure on the NT's already strained health system, with some units so busy that patients have at times been left waiting in beds in corridors.That's according to Dr Stephen Gourley, the NT chair of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM)."Unfortunately, you may end up in a bed in a corridor," Dr Gourley said. "When the hospital gets very full, we try our best to find people places to be and they're not always in the most ideal places."Early signs of the flu include fatigue, sudden fever and a sore throat. (Pixabay)Wait times 'rising' as nurses call for more staffThere has been a nationwide rise in flu-like illnesses, with more than 144,000 flu cases recorded around Australia so far this year.The Royal Darwin Hospital has 367 beds and the Alice Springs Hospital has 183 beds, according to the NT government website. Dr Gourley said emergency departments were "under the pump — and probably would be for the foreseeable future".This year, more than 700 flu patients have been admitted to hospital in the NT, compared with just five patients in 2021; 45 in 2020; 218 in 2019 and 454 in 2018. Why Australia's COVID-19 and flu cases are risingPhoto shows Jacqui Driver caught COVID twice ABC News_Fletcher YeungThe message is clear: The COVID-19 pandemic isn't over, and Australians should brace themself for a winter of not just that virus, but other lurgies too.That amounts to nearly all hospitalisations recorded over the past four years combined.But Dr Gourley said the squeeze in ED wasn't solely flu-related. He said it was also due to COVID-19 cases and a backlog of patients with chronic health conditions left untreated during the pandemic."Waiting times are much longer than they used to be," he said, adding it could be "hours" for some patients. "If you're critically unwell, you'll get seen instantly. But if you're not, you'll have to wait."The Territory's growing spike in flu cases has also highlighted chronic staffing issues at NT hospitals.Cath Hatcher, secretary of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation's NT branch, said nurses "desperately" wanted more staff to help ease the workload."They're all tired, they're all fatigued, they're just waiting on their turn to have some downtime on holidays," she said.Cath Hatcher has been sounding the alarm over nursing staff shortages for months.

We'd like to hear from you"If you've got a chronic illness like diabetes or asthma, or you're older than 65 or pregnant, [you] can also have some troubles with the flu," Dr Gourley said. Complications can include ear infections, sinus infections or bad pneumonia, he said. In some cases, the result can be deadly.Three people have died with the flu in the NT this season.With a large Indigenous population facing disproportionately high rates of chronic disease, the NT is particularly vulnerable to the worst health outcomes of influenza. Remote patients evacuated to DarwinThis year, flu patients have been medically evacuated from remote communities to the Royal Darwin Hospital, according to Sinon Cooney, chief executive of the Katherine West Health Board.He said this year's flu season in the territory had been significantly more severe than previous seasons, even those before COVID-19.Sinon Cooney oversees the provision of health care to remote Aboriginal communities west of Katherine, to the WA border and down to the top of the Tanami Desert. (ABC News: Che Chorley)"Flu has really hit hard in the Northern Territory, which seems to be more of a concern for us than it has been in other jurisdictions," he said.Flu cases hit remote NT communityPhoto shows An aerial view of a setting sun on a small settlement next to a tropical bayTop End health authorities are feeling the strain as they scramble to deal with the worst flu outbreak in years."We've had a few people who have ended up in hospital needing quite significant additional support to manage flu."Mr Cooney said a couple of patients have "ended up in ICU, which is obviously super concerning"."That obviously puts extreme strain on services like CareFlight, our staff on the ground and the hospital setting," he said.He said the next challenge for health authorities was to rapidly boost flu vaccination rates in a population fatigued by COVID-19.Calls grow for free flu jabs in the NTIn response to the territory's rising cases, Dr Robert Parker, Australian Medical Association of the NT (AMA NT) president, has renewed calls for the NT government to offer free flu vaccines."It would have been an advantage to have free immunisations as every other state has given," he said. "[That would] encourage people to get the vaccine — so if they do get the flu it reduces their burden of illness and the impact on the hospital — but possibly also [reduce] the population risk."At the moment, only vulnerable Territorians, including pregnant women and all Aboriginal people over the age of six months, are able to get the vaccine for free.Loading...Read our full coverage on COVID-19 hereLoading...Posted Sun 26 Jun 2022 at 7:31pmSunday 26 Jun 2022 at 7:31pmSun 26 Jun 2022 at 7:31pm, updated Thu 30 Jun 2022 at 3:18amThursday 30 Jun 2022 at 3:18amThu 30 Jun 2022 at 3:18amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter) News in LanguageListen to the news in Warlpiri, Yolngu Matha and KriolListenTop StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

This is combined testing that allows influenza and COVID-19 to be detected from one sample.So, how and where can you get tested for both COVID-19 and the flu? Here's what we know.South Australia offers joint COVID-19 and flu testing for high-risk peopleSouth Australians can go to any of the SA Pathology drive-through testing sites with a GP referral and be tested for 12 different viruses, including influenza, RSV and COVID-19.The 12 viruses tested for by the multi-virus (multiplex) test are: AdenovirusBordetella pertussisInfluenza A; Influenza BHuman metapneumovirusMycoplasma pneumoniaeParainfluenza 1; Parainfluenza 2; Parainfluenza 3RhinovirusRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)SA HealthHowever, the latest official health advice from South Australia advises only people in high-risk groups should have a combined COVID-19 and flu test.High risk groups include:children aged 5 years and youngerpeople aged 65 years or oldera resident of an aged care or long term residential care facilityAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoplepregnant womenpeople with long-term medical conditionspeople with a disability with significant or complex health needs or multiple comorbiditiespeople who are obese (BMI 30 or more)people who are sleeping rough.When it comes to dominant variants in the state, the latest genome testing from June 1-21 found 74.6 per cent of samples taken were BA.2.Free COVID-19-only tests — without a GP referral — will continue to be available at SA Pathology sites across the state.For more local information on PCR and flu testing, visit South Australia health. Queenslanders can access a single testWhere required, GPs and clinicians will refer Queenslanders to undertake combined testing. This means you will only have to have the one test, Queensland Health confirmed, although it's preferable that vulnerable groups are the first priority for access. When it comes to COVID-19 testing, Queensland health advises to look for a private pathology to get a COVID-19 PCR test, such as:4Cyte PathologyMater PathologyMedLabQueensland Medical Laboratories (QML)Sullivan and Nicolaides (SNP).For anyone still in doubt, Queensland Health also provides a map to locate your closest COVID-19 testing sites.People in the ACT need a referral for a single test"If an individual has a valid pathology referral form from a health professional for COVID-19 and influenza or any other respiratory viruses, this can be done at an ACT COVID-19 testing facility," an ACT health spokesperson said.However, they noted: "The ACT government-funded COVID-19 testing clinics are primarily just for COVID-19."As for walk-in PCR testing centres for COVID-19 without an appointment, you can access these sites. Multi-virus tests are available in NSW"People who are experiencing COVID or flu-like symptoms are encouraged to seek a PCR test, which can screen for both COVID-19 and influenza," a NSW Health spokesperson said. NSW Health Pathology sites use Respiratory Triplex PCR tests, which can simultaneously test for COVID-19, influenza and, in some cases, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the spokesperson added. Some private laboratories also test for COVID-19, influenza and RSV with a single test.Here's the full list of COVID-19 testing centres in NSW.No single test at state-run centres in VictoriaVictoria Health said it does not offer combined COVID-19 and influenza testing at state-run testing centres.How can I tell if I've had COVID-19?Photo shows A serious woman looks pensiveWinter is here, and COVID numbers are rising.

What makes some of us more resistant than others?It largely depends on each GP practice as to if you're tested there or referred to a private pathology provider."People whose age and/or medical conditions place them at higher risk from respiratory infections should discuss the best approach to testing and treatment with their GP," a Department of Health spokesperson said. As for COVID-19 testing sites, these include: free, drive-through COVID-19 testing clinics in Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and Burniefree, GP-led respiratory clinics in Hobart, Launceston and St Helensfree, mobile testing clinics your local GP clinic may offer COVID-19 testing, and GPs may charge a consultation fee.Online, there is a full list of COVID-19 of testing clinics in Tasmania. Single testing is available in Western AustraliaTesting for COVID-19 and influenza is available at private pathology clinics with a doctor’s referral, a WA Health spokesperson said. As in most states and territories, your GP is the first stop for respiratory illness, including flu.COVID-19 testing is available at COVID clinics, regional public hospitals and health services, remote health clinics and private pathology providers.PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA is the state-approved pathology provider at all public clinics.Testing is free at public and private COVID-19 testing facilities in both metropolitan and regional areas.And to find a COVID-19 testing clinic in metro and regional areas in Western Australia, see here. Single-testing availability unclear in the Northern TerritoryWe're still waiting to hear whether the single test is an option in the Northern Territory.What we do know is that you only need to have a COVID-19 PCR test if clinically required or requested by an authorised officer.See here for the list of Northern Territory testing locations.Loading...Read our full coverage on COVID-19 hereLoading...Posted Fri 1 Jul 2022 at 7:28pmFriday 1 Jul 2022 at 7:28pmFri 1 Jul 2022 at 7:28pm, updated Wed 6 Jul 2022 at 3:13amWednesday 6 Jul 2022 at 3:13amWed 6 Jul 2022 at 3:13amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

Photo: Joe Raedle (Getty Images) New research suggests even more benefits for flu vaccination in older people. The study found that adults over 65 who received at least one flu shot were noticeably less likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimerâs disease up to four years later. More research will be needed to confirm a cause-and-effect link and to figure out where this protective effect is coming from, however. Alzheimerâs disease is the most common form of dementia, and is thought to currently affect more than 5 million Americans. There are lifestyle habits that may reduce a personâs risk of Alzheimerâs, such as regular exercise, and there are medications that can help manage its symptoms. But there are no treatments known to substantially prevent or reverse its progression. However, some research has pointed to a relationship between certain infections and Alzheimerâs, which has led to hopes that preventing or treating these infections may lower its incidence or delay its onset. In 2020, researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston analyzed medical records and found a link between flu vaccination and a lower associated risk of diagnosed Alzheimerâs. This time, they turned to an even larger database of medical claims and were able to compare the outcomes of nearly a million pairs of adults over 65 throughout the U.S. who were either vaccinated or unvaccinated for the flu. The pairs were matched in factors like age and were tracked for an average of 46 months. During the study period, 8.5% of unvaccinated adults were diagnosed with Alzheimerâs or received medication often used to manage it, compared to 5.1% of vaccinated individualsâabout a 40% lower relative risk. There also appeared to be a cumulative effect, such that people who consistently got vaccinated annually during the study period were the least likely to develop Alzheimerâs. The findings were published online this month in the Journal of Alzheimerâs Disease. Studies in recent years have suggested that certain germs can hide in the brain following infection earlier on in life and directly trigger the development of Alzheimerâs, particularly herpesviruses. But the authors speculate that the connection seen in this study isnât necessarily unique to influenza. Rather, itâs more about the relationship between our immune system and the aging brain. âSince there is evidence that several vaccines may protect from Alzheimerâs disease, we are thinking that it isnât a specific effect of the flu vaccine,â said study author Paul Schulz, director of the Neurocognitive Disorders Center at UTâs McGovern Medical School, in a statement. âInstead, we believe that the immune system is complex, and some alterations, such as pneumonia, may activate it in a way that makes Alzheimerâs disease worse. But other things that activate the immune system may do so in a different wayâone that protects from Alzheimerâs disease.â These kinds of observational studies can only demonstrate a correlation between two things, not clearly prove a cause-and-effect link between vaccination and Alzheimerâs risk. But other research teams have found a similar connection. And of course, vaccines for the flu and other diseases remain effective at preventing severe illness from the germs they targetâbenefits that tend to be even more pronounced for older people. It will take time to figure out exactly why vaccines may help keep our brain in good shape, but theyâre doing plenty of good for us already. The researchers, for their part, may next plan to study whether covid-19 vaccines can offer a similar buffering effect against dementia.

Updated: 9:15 AM EDT Jun 29, 2022 Officials from Boston's Parks & Recreation Department say two swans living along the Charles River Esplanade have been euthanized after exhibiting bird flu symptoms.The Animal Care & Control Division responded to the Esplanade on Monday after receiving multiple calls about two sick swans.With the help of Boston firefighters, Animal Control Officer Patti Jones captured the adult swans and took them to the city's animal care facility."Unfortunately, the birds were quite ill, exhibiting symptoms consistent with avian influenza and were humanely euthanized," a statement from a Parks & Recreation official said.Officials said the two swans had five cygnets, and one observer of the swan family said there used to be six cygnets."The major trauma started to happen on Friday night, when one of the six baby cygnets actually died near the nest," said Dr. Patricia Arroyo.Arroyo said the cygnet's death appeared to be a sad accident, and that the rest of the swan family appeared to be healthy and active all weekend. But on Monday, something dramatically changed."Monday morning, I got a call and we came out, and the mom was in real distress," Arroyo said.Arroyo and other watchers of the Esplanade swans called in wildlife experts and watched through tears and rain, as the mother swan struggled to even lift its head."And as that happened, we saw the five remaining baby cygnets swim back to the nest alone. And then we found the dad in distress, actually in worse condition than the mother," Arroyo said.The five cygnets were captured and taken to the Cape Wildlife Center in Barnstable, which will test the birds for avian flu and help rehabilitate them. A severe strain of avian flu has been spreading globally and in recent weeks, has killed hundreds of birds on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard.Although Boston officials said the euthanized swans were exhibiting avian flu symptoms, some wonder whether blue-green algae may have been to blame — as the severe heat on Sunday could have caused the toxic cyanobacteria to bloom.The swans' deaths come nearly 13 months after a mother swan that nested along the Charles River Esplanade died suddenly. The Boston Animal Control department later said a necropsy performed on that swan did not provide any additional insight into its death."It's just sad that something that is bringing us all this joy is turning into heartbreak again," said Manuela Jambrina-Escobar.People who encounter a bird in distress are encouraged to keep their distance, but to take a picture or video and send it to the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.

Wildlife biologists are finding whole colonies of birds dead or dying on the islands. Caspian terns are listed as threatened in Michigan and endangered in Wisconsin.This article is part of The Great Lakes News Collaborative, which includes Bridge Michigan, Circle of Blue, Great Lakes Now at Detroit Public Television, and Michigan Radio. It unites newsroom resources to report on the most pressing threats to the Great Lakes and drinking water supplies, including pollution, climate change, and aging infrastructure. The independent journalism is supported by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation.“Seeing hundreds of dead birds scattered in a line before you with others dying among those…it's a feeling of helplessness, knowing that there's nothing, absolutely nothing you can do for those birds,” said Sumner Matteson, an avian ecologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Related:The bird flu: Clean your birdfeeder right nowWash your hands: Highly contagious bird flu reaches Michigan wild flocksMatteson said he’s never seen anything so traumatic in his 42 years on the job.On Bellow Island in Michigan’s Grand Traverse Bay, another scientist discovered colonies that were wiped out. “Last count prior to the time we were out there was 201 nests and we found 255 dead adults,” said Jim Ludwig, an environmental consultant who has studied Great Lakes birds for decades. In the distance, a worker is picking up dead Caspian terns. Hundreds of them died from bird flu on this Wisconsin island. (Courtesy of Sumner Matteson, WI DNR)He guessed that more than that died elsewhere, including in the lake, while scavengers might have carried off other remains. Found along the coasts of oceans and large lakes, the crow-sized birds are white and gray in color, with long, reddish-orange, black-tipped bills. Long-lived and slow to procreate, they can survive 30 years but don’t breed until they’re at least three years old. The terns eat mostly fish, with a particular taste for alewife in the Great Lakes, and nest in dense ground colonies, which could make them particularly vulnerable to spreading disease.“Caspian terns are magnificent birds. They've got that striking black cap and they fly along, looking down at the water while they fly and then suddenly plunge into the water to catch fish. They're exciting to watch,” said Lisa Williams, a Contaminants Specialist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. A line of dead Caspian terns with their exposed nests full of eggs in the foreground. (Courtesy of Sumner Matteson, WI DNR)In recent years, the bird’s population has been growing. In 2018 they peaked at about 10,000 Caspian terns in the Great Lakes region. Then high water levels made nesting difficult for the birds.Now it appears that Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza known as bird flu is killing them by the hundreds.“Caspian terns nest very close together,” Williams said. “And for a disease that's transmitted through the air, they're in close enough proximity that that can happen fairly readily on their colonies.” The result is that at least 1,476 adult terns are dead on Lake Michigan islands A Herring gull chick finds shelter under the wing of a dead Caspian tern. (Courtesy of Sumner Matteson, WI DNR)Sadie O’Dell, a wildlife biologist at Wisconsin’s Gravel Island National Wildlife Refuge, a protected breeding ground for colonial nesting birds, said the terns discovered still alive could barely hold their heads up. They were experiencing tremors from the neurological damage caused by the bird flu virus. Some were in their nests, still trying to incubate eggs when they died.Matteson said at this point, as estimated 64 percent of the adult Caspian terns in Wisconsin are dead.“Absolutely devastating. Catastrophic. It's going to take years for the Wisconsin population to recover,” he said, or perhaps decades. Such a massive die-off will mean the loss of a new generation of Caspian terns, said Francie Cuthbert, a professor with the University of Minnesota’s Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation Biology.Sponsor “No young are being produced,” Cuthbert said. “And then the loss of all of these adults is serious.”“Losing all these older, experienced breeders is also very important because they tend to increase in terms of their productivity and just their knowledge of how to raise young,” Cuthbert said. Why Caspian terns are being hit so hard by avian influenza, while other close-nesting seabirds have not experienced the same kind of devastation is baffling to the scientists. There have been deaths among ring-billed gulls, cormorants, and others, but not at the rate of Caspian tern deaths.Cuthbert said it’s hard to say how critical the deaths will be to the future of the bird. “Until we really have a full tally on how many birds have died, we're not going to be able to model the impact on the population, but it's definitely going to have a deep drop.” Related Articles: What a Donald Trump presidency means for Michigan’s environment November 8, 2024 | Kelly House in Michigan Environment Watch Great Lakes’ water levels dropping, but still just about average October 17, 2024 | Janelle D.

I had just boarded the train from D.C. to New York City a couple of weeks ago and, along with several other passengers, was craning my neck to get a look at what was going on. This was not the reedy dregs of some lingering cold. This was a deep, constant, full-bodied cough. Think garbage disposal with a fork caught inside.No one said anything to the man (at least to my knowledge). If someone had, though, I imagine that he might have replied with a now-familiar pandemic-times refrain: “Don’t worry! It’s not COVID!” Such assurances can be perfectly fine (polite, even), say, at the height of allergy season, when you want worried-looking company to know that you are not, in fact, showering them with deadly virus. But assurances only go so far. As my colleague Katherine J. Wu recently wrote, a negative COVID test, especially in the early days of symptomatic illness, is no guarantee that you’re not infected and contagious. And even setting that concern aside, still: Whatever it was that had that maskless man hacking away like a malfunctioning kitchen appliance, I didn’t want that either!If you’re feeling sick, just because you don’t have COVID “does not mean that you rip your mask off and go get on an airplane next to other people—that’s rude,” Emily Landon, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Chicago, told me. “Maybe you’re ruining someone’s vacation … Maybe they’re going to see their mom in hospice. Let’s not ruin other people’s lives and plans.”Read: America is sliding into the long pandemic defeatOver the past two-plus years, the public has undergone a crash course in preventing the transmission of respiratory viruses. We have learned the importance of testing and masking and distancing and isolating and ventilating. These lessons, some better received than others, apply just as well to more familiar pathogens such as influenza and common-cold coronaviruses as to the novel one that has reshaped our lives. We understand better than ever how to be a good sick person. Now we’ll see whether anyone puts that knowledge to use.The first and most important rule of feeling sick is to stay home. This, says Ryan Langlois, an immunologist at the University of Minnesota, is at once “the easiest and the most difficult” directive. Easy because it’s so simple: Stay in your house! Do not leave! No technical expertise required. Difficult because actually following it entails major disruptions of daily life. For white-collar workers, the normalization of working from home has made this a good deal more convenient than it was (and has, one can only hope, dispelled once and for all the fiction that dragging yourself to work sick is an act of self-sacrificing fortitude; it’s not—it’s just plain inconsiderate). For much of the labor force, though, remote work isn’t an option, and more than a fifth of American workers don’t have paid sick leave. Among the country’s lowest earners—the people most likely to need it—only about a third do. (Every wealthy country in the world except the United States guarantees paid sick leave.)Read: The real reason Americans aren’t isolatingThe complicated part of isolating is knowing when to stop. No one-size-fits-all formula will spit out the right answer in every case, for every type of infection, Langlois told me. One person might be completely virus-free five days after symptom onset; another might still be highly contagious. Even for the most responsible among us, this ambiguity can make for some awkward calculus. Can you afford to miss that work meeting? How about family dinner? It would be a real pain to cancel those travel plans—but should you?After a couple of years of COVID management, we at least in theory have better tools and practices for helping people manage these situations. Many of us have gotten into the habit of regularly testing and retesting ourselves for COVID, and now is no time to stop. But Seema Lakdawala, a flu-transmission expert at the University of Pittsburgh, envisions a world with universally accessible testing for a whole range of pathogens: influenza, RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus, seasonal-cold-causing coronaviruses, and, of course, SARS-CoV-2. Sites at every street corner would offer patients not only a diagnosis but a prescription for the appropriate medication. People in rural areas could acquire at-home tests at drug stores or order them online. Someone who tested positive only for a seasonal coronavirus could undertake a more relaxed isolation (Langlois, for one, doesn’t think it’s practical to ask people to fully stay home for a common cold, though they should certainly still mask), while someone who tested positive for influenza, which kills tens of thousands of people most years, would know to take stricter precautions. Whatever the situation, you’d know you were in the clear when you tested negative for whatever you’d originally tested positive for.For now, Lakdawala admits that a world of such universal, accessible testing remains a distant fantasy. She and the other experts I spoke with offered several more-practical pieces of guidance. Even if it gets awkward, it’s good practice to notify people you may have exposed to a pathogen, just as we’ve been encouraged to do with COVID. If you have a fever, keep to yourself as much as possible until at least 24 hours after it subsides. If you don’t have a fever, Landon told me, you should be clear to reenter society after your symptoms resolve. For a common cold, she said, that generally takes three to five days; for flu, five to seven. Certain symptoms can stick around for weeks after that, but as long as you’re not feeling disgusting, Landon said, you can responsibly venture out. (Call it the “ew” test.) Leaving isolation with a lingering cough is fine, Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist at George Mason University, told me, “as long as it’s not that wet, nasty cough.” (If you’re really interested in the nitty-gritty, you can always consult the CDC’s 206-page door-stopper on isolation precautions, but Popescu does not recommend: “I wouldn’t subject anyone to that.”)If you’re still symptomatic after the recommended isolation period, or if you must venture out before it’s over, whether on an essential errand or because your employer doesn’t grant sick leave, you should wear a high-quality mask. The same is true, Landon told me, of that ambiguous period when you feel a little off and are just starting to wonder whether you’re coming down with something: If you’re not sure, mask up. People tend to be quite contagious during that stage, and the worst thing that can happen is you take a minor superfluous precaution and wake up the next morning feeling fine. Yes, masks can be uncomfortable, and yes, it’s a tragedy that such a fundamental health intervention has been co-opted into the culture war, but they remain one of the most effective, least disruptive tools at our disposal for fighting all types of respiratory infections. An N95 or KN95 is best, but a surgical or cloth mask is better than nothing, Lakdawala said, especially because plenty of people can’t afford to continually replenish a stock of top-notch disposables. Health-care providers and employers, she suggested, could offer free masks, which would protect patients, workers, and those around them.Like widespread testing, a continuous supply of free masks and universal paid sick leave are merely a distant vision. Congress is currently struggling to prop up our most basic public-health infrastructure during a pandemic, leaving Americans to figure out COVID for themselves. The same will likely apply to all the other familiar viruses we reacquaint ourselves with. Whether the more modest, behavioral changes we’ve adopted over the past two-plus years outlast the pandemic is anyone’s guess. In this era of perpetual flux, one constant has been the disconnect between what we know we ought to do and what we actually end up doing.Better to know than not to, but personal experience hasn’t left me optimistic that knowledge will reliably translate into action. On the train, after a few minutes of fruitless waiting to see whether the man a few rows back would stop coughing, I gathered my bags and relocated to another car. At first, all was quiet. Then two people started to cough.About the AuthorJacob Stern is a contributing writer at The Atlantic.More StoriesThe Dream of Streaming Is DeadA Critic’s Case Against CinemaRACGP - Second application pending for under-fives COVID vaccine Home About Clinical Authors Most read this year GP Opinion Videos & Podcasts Professional Comments policy RACGP poll Menu Search for: Advertising newsGP > Clinical Jolyon Attwooll 30 Jun 2022 News Second application pending for under-fives COVID vaccine Jolyon Attwooll 30/06/2022 4:18:45 PM Pfizer has been told it can apply for its Comirnaty vaccine to be used to immunise children under five in Australia. A three-year-old after receiving a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination in Seattle. (Image: AAP Photos) There may soon be two COVID-19 vaccines available for young children in Australia. Earlier this month, Federal Minister for Health and Aged Care Mark Butler stated that a decision on the use of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine for children aged six months to five years will likely be made ‘in the coming weeks’. Now the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has confirmed it has granted Pfizer permission to make an application to extend the use of its own vaccine to a similar age group. While the TGA has previously confirmed receipt of Moderna’s application, it stated that approving the process for Pfizer did not mean the company had already applied for the eligibility extension. ‘It does not mean an application for use in this age group has been made and it does not mean any subsequent application would be approved,’ an announcement from the TGA states. If both or either of the vaccines are approved by the TGA and then recommended for use by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), it would mean almost the entire population of Australia would be eligible for vaccination. This month, US authorities approved both the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines for use in the youngest cohort of the population and vaccinations have already begun. The Pfizer vaccine for the youngest age group is administered in three doses. If approved, Professor Robert Booy said the Pfizer vaccine will be most relevant for more vulnerable children, with some likely to find the multiple vaccinations an obstacle. ‘This provides protection but is not very convenient for parents,’ he said. ‘The issue of COVID in young children is especially focused on that small minority who has a major medical problem, including immunosuppression. ‘Should the new Pfizer vaccine be recommended in Australia it would best be focused on children at high risk of severe COVID.’ He said other vaccines are likely to be available soon that would only require two injections and stressed the importance of influenza vaccination for the age group, saying that flu ‘may well be more severe in young children than COVID’.

There have been more cases across Scotland affecting guillemots, terns and puffins, with dead birds also washing up along the Northumberland and Teesside coasts.While boat tours will continue to sail around the islands, visitors will not be able to step ashore from Sunday.Image source, Nick UptonImage caption, The National Trust said with seabirds nesting in close proximity any spread of the virus could be "devastating"Farne Islands general manager Simon Lee said: "While we have no confirmed test results from the islands, we are now starting to see the terribly sad and distressing impact of avian influenza on our internationally important and threatened seabirds who make the islands their home."Seabirds nesting in dense colonies, most of which are threatened, such as Arctic Terns, are particularly vulnerable now as they have returned to the islands in their thousands to breed, nesting in close proximity to each other."The Farne Islands are home to approximately 200,000 seabirds including guillemots, kittiwakes, razorbills and shags in addition to Arctic terns and puffins. Image source, Nick UptonImage caption, The National Trust estimates about 45,000 people visit the Farne Islands every yearMr Lee said: "By closing the islands we will reduce the risk of disturbance on the birds, which will hopefully help at least slow down the spread of the disease during this breeding period before they leave the islands in late summer to continue their annual migratory cycle."The conservation charity has called on the government to do more to protect important seabird colonies.Ben McCarthy, the charity's head of nature conservation and restoration ecology, said: "We desperately need government to take more effective action, including a National Response Plan that includes practical steps to support our conservation teams, surveillance and monitoring of spread in wild bird populations, research into ways of slowing its spread, and clear biosecurity measures."Rangers will continue to monitor the birds while the islands are closed to visitors.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it is aware of a "number of wild bird deaths in several locations in England" and that the Animal and Plant Agency is carrying out surveillance.Defra said anyone who finds dead seabirds should not touch them but report them by calling 0345 9335577.Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, external, Facebook, external and Instagram, external.

Dr Durrheim said a concerning feature of the subvariant was that a previous COVID-19 infection didn't provide people much protection - meaning keeping up with vaccine boosters was essential. "We all got very good at wearing masks and social distancing and we can still do that," he said. "Don't spread it around."Influenza cases have exploded in a worrying turn. The New England area recorded zero cases across the entire season last year. About a month ago, there were 25 cases clocked in the space of seven days. Last week alone, lab tests confirmed 285 infections."That is just the tip of the iceberg ... it's an early start and it's a steep increase," Dr Durrheim said. A PCR test can reveal a COVID-19 infection but can also confirm a flu diagnosis or another highly contagious respiratory illness known as RSV.Dr Durrheim said hygiene and masking up work. He urged locals to roll up their sleeves for a free flu shot and seek a PCR test if symptoms develop.Youngsters under the age of five presenting to the region's emergency departments with respiratory problems have dramatically increased - many likely due to RSV."It's a horrible virus in little kids ... they really struggle to breathe," Dr Durrheim said. He urged parents to keep unwell children at home. ShareFacebookTwitterWhatsappEmailCopyAnna FalkenmirePolice and crime reporter at the Newcastle Herald.

Covid-19 Response Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall and Health Minister Andrew Little. Photo: RNZ Health Minister Andrew Little said the government was expanding access to the flu vaccine after noticing an increase in pre-schoolers hospitalised with the illness. "We're making free flu shots available to another 800,000 New Zealanders, including children, more of whom are having to go to hospital," Little said. "Free flu shots are already available for everyone over the age of 65 and those at risk of becoming seriously ill or who have underlying conditions. "This season we ordered 40 per cent more vaccines. We've already seen more than one million New Zealanders get a flu shot, but with significant pressure on our health system we're ramping up efforts to get as many people vaccinated as possible." The vaccine will be free for children aged 3 to 12 and to people with serious mental health or addiction needs. From Tuesday, a second Covid-19 booster dose will also be available to anyone over 50, and health, aged-care and disability-care workers over the age of 30, with a six-month gap between doses. Covid-19 Response Minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said a second booster was available for everyone over the age of 50. It was recommended for anyone over the age of 65, as well as Māori and Pacific peoples older than 50 and people who are severely immunocompromised, which was where roll-out efforts were focused. "Making sure people in aged residential care have the vaccine made available to them - we've already kicked off on that - and then through all the Māori and Pacific and disability providers, making sure that access is good and strong. "If we see any evidence that we should bring the age down we will of course ask the experts to advise us again on it," Verrall told Morning Report. The availablity of the second booster has also been extended to health, aged-care and disability workers over the age of 30. "My understanding is that's the cutoff beneath which side effects of the vaccine can be more frequent," Verrall said. "We know that we have a wide range of workers in the health workforce and that additional dose may be beneficial in those where we're not concerned about their being any additional side effects." "For those not at risk of severe illness from Covid-19, a two-dose primary course and one booster continues to provide very good protection. So, for those who haven't had a first booster, please act now." The second booster dose should be offered six months after the previous dose, and postponed for three months after a Covid-19 infection. A second booster dose is not recommended for anyone who is pregnant and is healthy, including those with no underlying health conditions which could increase the risk of severe Covid-19. "Staying up-to-date with the recommended Covid-19 vaccinations will continue to protect you from the risk of serious illness, hospitalisation or death," Dr Verrall said. "The combination of Omicron and flu is making this winter more challenging than normal. "The best thing New Zealanders can do to ensure they and their families don't end up in hospital is to be up-to-date with their flu and Covid-19 vaccinations and boosters." Anyone who is eligible for a second booster can get one without a prescription from a range of places, including walk-in and drive-through vaccination centres, booking online using Book My Vaccine or by calling the Covid Vaccination Healthline on 0800 282926. Widened access to the free flu vaccine to 3 to 12-year-olds was in response to more children being hospitalised with the illness, Verrall said. "While we knew that flu could be different this year we didn't know how precisely it would be different. We have seen this increase in childhood hospitalisations so we've made the change now." Flu shots are available by booking with GPs or local pharmacies. On the suggestion that masks should be compulsory in schools, Verrall said schools had not stood out in the evidence as a place where there was more transmission, so masks would still be be encouraged rather than mandatory.
