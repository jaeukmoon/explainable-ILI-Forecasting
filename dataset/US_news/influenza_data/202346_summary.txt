Avian influenza (AI) is a disease caused by the avian influenza virus (AIV) and can infect domestic poultry and other bird species. Currently, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is used to detect AIV, but it requires sophisticated laboratory equipment. A study aimed to develop a rapid and reliable diagnostic test using the reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA)/CRISPR method. The method combines RT-RPA with the Cas12a/crRNA trans-cleavage system and can detect AIV with a high sensitivity limit. It showed no cross-reactivity with other avian-derived RNA viruses. The method has the potential to be used as a user-friendly and inexpensive platform for point-of-care testing.
