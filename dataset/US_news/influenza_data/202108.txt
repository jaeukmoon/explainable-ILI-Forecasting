Here, we utilize epigraph, a computational algorithm, to design a universal swine H3 influenza vaccine. The epigraph hemagglutinin proteins are delivered using an Adenovirus type 5 vector and are compared to a wild type hemagglutinin and the commercial inactivated vaccine, FluSure. In mice, epigraph vaccination leads to significant cross-reactive antibody and T-cell responses against a diverse panel of swH3 isolates. Epigraph vaccination also reduces weight loss and lung viral titers in mice after challenge with three divergent swH3 viruses. Vaccination studies in swine, the target species for this vaccine, show stronger levels of cross-reactive antibodies and T-cell responses after immunization with the epigraph vaccine compared to the wild type and FluSure vaccines. In both murine and swine models, epigraph vaccination shows superior cross-reactive immunity that should be further investigated as a universal swH3 vaccine.

Influenza A virus in swine (IAV-S) can cause zoonotic infections in humans, representing a potential threat to human health2,3. When the influenza virus of swine origin infects humans, it is termed a variant infection. Since 2010, there have been >460 reported IAV-S variant infections in humans in the United States of America4. Pigs are susceptible to swine, avian, and human influenza viruses, making them the perfect “mixing vessel” for novel reassorted influenza viruses2,5. These novel reassorted viruses have significant pandemic potential if zoonosis occurs, as seen with 2009 H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic. This highly-reassorted swine-origin influenza virus quickly circulated the globe and infected a staggering 24% of the world’s human population6,7. As the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century, this highlights the threat that zoonotic IAV-S poses to human health.IAV-S not only poses a potential human health threat from zoonosis, but it also represents a significant burden on the pork industry. IAV-S infection of pigs results in high morbidity, with many of the same symptoms as human influenza infections8. IAV-S infection can cause tremendous economic loss to swine producers, with cost estimates as high as $10.31 per market pig9. In the USA, over 95% of swine nursery sites vaccinated weaned pigs against IAV-S infection. However, 50% of those sites also reported IAV-S infections in their herds despite vaccination10. This highlights the ongoing challenge of vaccinating against the highly diverse and evolving influenza virus. Currently, most commercial IAV-S vaccines are traditional whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccines containing both H1 and H3 subtypes, often with an oil-in-water adjuvant11. However, these commercial vaccines are infrequently updated and do not protect against the large diversity of IAV-S circulating in the swine population. This has led to the use of autogenous, or custom, vaccines that contain herd-specific IAV-S strains and are limited to use within that herd. An estimated 50% of IAV-S vaccines sold are autogenous vaccines10,11,12. However, autogenous vaccines have multiple drawbacks, including labor-intensive laboratory techniques for diagnosis, isolation, virus growth, and purification, which results in a lag period before the vaccine can be administered11. The limited strains that were currently available in commercial swine influenza vaccines paired with the significant drawback to autogenous vaccines highlight the urgent need for a universal swine influenza vaccine. A universal swine influenza vaccine could reduce the economic impact of IAV-S on the pork industry, along with reducing the risk of emergent zoonotic influenza viruses into the human population.Currently, the IAV-S subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 circulating in the swine population worldwide1. We chose to focus on the swine H3 (swH3) subtype for this study because the H3N2 subtype accounted for >90% of the IAV-S variant human infections reported in the US since 20104. The swH3 subtype is highly diverse, with multiple human-to-swine introduction events establishing the contemporary H3N2 strains circulating in different regions of the world. In Europe, the swine H3N2 subtype emerged in the early 1970s from the introduction of a human lineage H3N2 strain8,13. However, in North America, the H3 subtype was not found in the swine population until 1998 when a triple-reassorted H3N2 virus emerged14. The North American strains are divided into clusters I–IV, with cluster IV further divided into A–F, and are divergent from contemporary Eurasian strains8. Additionally, in 2010–2011, a human seasonal H3N2 was transmitted to North American swine and established a lineage of human-like H3 viruses that are antigenically distinct from other North American clusters15,16. The high diversity of the swH3 population represents a significant challenge in the development of a vaccine that induces strong levels of broadly cross-reactive immunity.This study aims to evaluate a vaccine antigen designer, called the Epigraph vaccine designer tool, for the design of a universal swH3 influenza vaccine17. The epigraph is a graph-based algorithm that creates a cocktail of vaccine antigens designed to maximize the potential epitope coverage of a highly diverse population. This epigraph algorithm has been used to predict therapeutic HIV vaccine candidates18 and has shown promising potential in vivo as a Pan-Filovirus vaccine19. Here, we utilize the Epigraph vaccine designer in the development of a universal swH3 vaccine by computationally designing a cocktail of three swH3 hemagglutinins (HA), a surface glycoprotein of influenza. This is the first report evaluating the epigraph algorithm for the design of a broadly reactive influenza vaccine. The epigraph HA immunogens were expressed in a replication-defective Adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5) vector and compared to a wild-type HA (TX98) and the commercial inactivated adjuvanted vaccine, FluSure. We evaluated the cross-reactivity of the epigraph vaccine by measuring both antibody and T-cell responses in mice and swine. Additionally, we evaluated cross-protective immunity against three diverse swH3 strains after challenge in mice. These data support the use of epigraph immunogens in the development of a universal swH3 vaccine.ResultsDevelopment and characterization of the swH3 epigraph HA vaccineWe designed the swH3 epigraph HA using the Epigraph vaccine designer tool, a graph-based algorithm that creates a cocktail of immunogens designed to maximize potential epitope coverage in a population17,18. First, the Epigraph vaccine designer determines the frequency of each potential epitope of designated length (k-mer) in the target population. The algorithm then uses a graph-based approach to trace a path across the HA protein that contains the most common epitopes in the population, resulting in a full length computationally designed HA protein (epigraph 1). The first epigraph, by design, tends to be very central in its composition (Fig. 1a). This algorithm then is repeated, to create complementary epigraph sequences that minimize, to the extent possible, potential epitopes contained in the previous epigraph immunogens. In this way, the epigraph 2 and 3 construct generally contain the second and third most common epitopes in the population, respectively. These sequences will appear as outliers in a phylogeny, as their composition reflects different k-mer frequencies from sequences throughout the tree (Fig. 1a). The resulting trivalent set of epigraph sequences provides the optimal coverage of potential linear epitopes in the population for a 3-protein set, minimizes the inclusion of rare epitopes that might result in type-specific immune responses, and although artificial, each epigraph resembles natural HA proteins to enable both the induction of antibody and T-cell responses.Fig. 1: Characterization of the epigraph vaccine constructs.The three swH3 epigraph immunogens were computationally designed using the Epigraph vaccine designer tool to create a cocktail of immunogens designed to maximize potential epitope coverage in a population. The three epigraph hemagglutinin (HA) immunogens were aligned to the 1561 unique swine H3 HA sequences using a ClustalW alignment. A neighbor-joining tree was constructed to visualize the phylogenic relationship between the vaccine immunogens and the population of swH3 sequences. The three epigraph immunogens, the Texas/1998 (TX98) wild-type HA comparator, and the two FluSure strains are labeled for reference on the phylogenetic tree. The epigraph, wildtype, and FluSure vaccines are shown in the blue, green, and black boxes, respectively. The North American clusters, 2010 human-like lineage, and Eurasian lineage are circled in a dotted line (a). All three epigraph immunogens and the TX98 HA were cloned into a replication-defective Adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5) vector and HA protein expression was confirmed by western blot. GAPDH is used as a cellular protein loading control (b). Confirmation of HA protein expression was obtained from three independent western blot experiments.Full size imageThe resulting three epigraph HA sequences were aligned back to the original swH3 sequence population and a phylogenic tree was constructed to visualize their relationship to the swH3 population. The three epigraph swH3 immunogens localize across the phylogenic tree (Fig. 1a). To evaluate the computational design of the epigraph vaccine, we selected a HA gene that localizes near the center of the tree (A/swine/Texas/4199-2/1998 [TX98]) as a wild-type comparator. In addition, we also compared our epigraph vaccine to a commercial IAV-S vaccine, FluSure. FluSure is an inactivated, oil-in-water adjuvanted vaccine that contains two North American swH3 strains (along with two H1 strains), which belong to the North American IV-A and IV-B clusters. The three swH3 epigraph genes and the TX98 wild-type HA comparator were cloned into a replication-defective HAdV-5 vector for gene expression. Gene expression was confirmed via western blot (Fig. 1b) and virus particle (vp) to infectious unit ratios were determined to confirm approximate infectivity between the stocks (Supplementary Table 1).Vaccination with epigraph lead to the development of a strong cross-reactive antibody response in miceWe first evaluated the immune response after vaccination in mice. BALB/c mice (n = 10) were vaccinated with 1010 vp of the HAdV-5-epigraph vaccine, which consisted of equal ratios of the three HAdV-5-epigraph viruses totaling 1010 vp. Our epigraph vaccine was compared to mice vaccinated with either 1010 vp of the HAdV-5-TX98 wild-type comparator or 50 μL of FluSure (which translates to 10✕ the equivalent dose of a 3-week-old pig). A PBS sham vaccine was used as a negative control. Three weeks later, mice were boosted with the same vaccine. Mice were sacrificed 2 weeks after boosting to examine the humoral and cellular immune response after vaccination (Fig. 2a). The cross-reactivity of the antibody response was examined using a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. We selected a panel of 20 swH3 strains which represent much of the diversity of the swH3 phylogenetic tree. This panel contains representative strains from multiple North American clusters along with Eurasian isolates. In addition, the panel contains human-like strains from both the contemporary 2010 human-like lineage and a historical human-like strain that arose from a human-to-swine transmission event (Colorado/1977). A phylogenetic tree was constructed to examine the relationship of the selected 20 strains to the vaccine strains (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Table 2). Vaccination with the epigraph immunogens resulted in a strong cross-reactive antibody response, with HI titers ≥40 to 14 of the 20 (70%) swH3 strains. Epigraph vaccination showed the greatest cross-reactivity against North American and 2010 human-like strains, with HI titers ≥40 to 11 of the 13 (85%) North American strains and both 2010 human-like strains. For the Eurasian strains, epigraph vaccination induced HI titers ≥40 to 1 of the 4 Eurasian strains tested. Importantly, epigraph vaccination-induced significantly higher antibody titers as compared to the TX98 and FluSure groups for 11 of the 20 of the swH3 strains (Fig. 2c). In contrast, the TX98 wild-type comparator and FluSure vaccinated mice developed strong antibody titers (≥40) to 3 of the 20 (15%) and 4 of the 20 (20%) swH3 strains, respectively. The TX98 group developed a strong antibody response to the matched virus Texas/1998 and limited cross-reactivity with only two other strains (Wyoming/2013 and Minnesota/2012). The FluSure vaccine group developed a strong antibody response to two cluster IV-A viruses and to the Minnesota/2012 cluster IV-B strain (a match for the vaccine strain). However, FluSure vaccination provided only limited cross-reactivity with mismatched viruses.Fig. 2: Cross-reactive antibody responses with swH3 strains after vaccination in mice.BALB/c mice (n = 10) were vaccinated according to the timeline and vaccine dose (a). To examine the cross-reactivity of the antibody response after vaccination, a panel of 20 swH3 strains were selected that span the phylogenic tree. A maximum-likelihood tree was constructed to visualize the relationship between these assay strains and the vaccine immunogens (b). The cluster or lineage designation is in parentheses after the full strain name. Two weeks after boosting, mice were sacrificed, and sera were analyzed using a HI assay against the 20 swH3 representative strains (c). Cluster or lineage designation can be seen above the HI titer bars for each strain (one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons compared to the epigraph group; n = 10 mice for all groups, except n = 5 for Nebraska/2013, Minnesota/2011, Ohio/2016, Denmark/2011, Italy/1985, Hong Kong/1976, Italy/1995). Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM). A heat map of these HI titers was constructed to further visualize the total cross-reactive antibody response of each vaccine.Full size imageEpigraph immunized mice have a higher total T-cell response and recognize more epitopes from four divergent swH3 strainsCross-reactive T cells have been shown to play an important role in viral clearance during influenza virus infection20,21. Therefore, we wanted to evaluate if there was increased cross-reactivity of T-cell responses after vaccination with the epigraph vaccine. To examine the cross-reactivity, we selected four swH3 strains that represent a large portion of swH3 diversity. Peptide arrays for the Ohio/2011 strain (cluster IV-A), Manitoba/2005 (cluster IV), Texas/1998 (cluster I), and Colorado/1977 (human-like) were constructed. The T-cell response to each of the four strains was mapped using an IFNγ ELISPOT with an overlapping peptide array containing 17-mers with 10-amino acid overlap. Peptides were considered positive if the response was greater than 50 spot-forming cells (SFC) per million. Epigraph vaccinated mice recognized a greater number of epitopes across all four swH3 strains as compared to the TX98 vaccinated mice (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, the epigraph vaccine induces a significant and robust T-cell response to the Colorado/1977 virus despite not inducing a detectable antibody response against this strain. Therefore, this strain was selected specifically to examine the potential for cross-reactive T cells in the absence of detectable cross-reactive antibodies. In contrast, FluSure vaccinated mice did not develop significant T-cell responses after vaccination (Fig. 3). The magnitude of the responses to each peptide revealed an immunodominant epitope in the HA1 region (amino acid 120–128 of the HA protein) that was positive in all four strains after vaccination with an epigraph. This epitope was predicted to bind strongly to the MHC-I complex of BALB/c mice22,23 and, therefore, is likely an immunodominant CD8 epitope (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, T cells from epigraph vaccinated mice recognized this immunodominant epitope in the Texas/1998 peptide array, however, T cells from TX98 vaccinated mice did not. One possible explanation may be differences in peptide processing and presentation which are dependent on surrounding sequences. Overall, the total T-cell response was significantly stronger in epigraph vaccinated mice against all four swH3 strains (Fig. 3c).Fig. 3: T-cell epitope mapping of four diverse swH3 strains after vaccination.Splenocytes from vaccinated BALB/c mice (n = 5) were isolated and analyzed for cellular immunity using an IFNγ ELISpot. T-cell epitopes against the Ohio/2011, Manitoba/2005, Texas/1998, and Colorado/1977 strains were mapped using an overlapping peptide array consisting of 17-mers with 10-amino acid overlap which spanned the entire hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Peptide responses >50 spot-forming cells (SFC) per million were considered positive. Positive peptides for each vaccine and their location on the HA protein are indicated (a). The peptide number designates the position of the last amino acid in the peptide on the total HA protein. The level of response against each positive peptide is reported as SFC per million splenocytes with the dotted line indicating the 50 SFC/million cutoff (b). The total T-cell response to each virus peptide array is shown for all vaccination groups (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons) (c). Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM).Full size imageVaccination with epigraph reduces weight loss and lung viral titers after swH3 challenge in miceWe next wanted to determine if the increased cross-reactive antibody and T-cell responses translated to increased protection from a panel of diverse swH3 strains. BALB/c mice (n = 10) were vaccinated with a single shot of 1010 vp of HAdV-5-epigraph or HAdV-5-TX98, FluSure, or a PBS sham vaccine. Mice were then challenged 3 weeks later with the mouse-adapted swH3 challenge viruses (Fig. 4a). To examine the antibody response after a single immunization, sera at the time of challenge was examined using an HI assay against each of the three challenge strains (Fig. 4b). A single immunization of epigraph resulted in strong HI titers ≥40 to both Ohio/2011 and Manitoba/2005. In contrast, TX98 vaccination did not result in any detectable antibody responses to these three viruses, while FluSure vaccination resulted in low titers (≤40) to Ohio/2011 and Manitoba/2005. No vaccine groups developed antibody responses to the Colorado/1977 strain, making this an ideal strain to evaluate the potential contribution of cross-reactive T-cell responses. After the challenge, mice were monitored for weight loss over 2 weeks. On day 3 post challenge, five mice were sacrificed to examine lung viral titers. We measured lung viral titers by both TCID50 and qPCR to evaluate infectious virus and viral RNA copies, respectively (Fig. 4).Fig. 4: Protection against challenge with divergent swH3 viruses.BALB/c mice (n = 10) were vaccinated with 1010 vp of HAdV-5-epigraph or HAdV-5-TX98, the commercial inactivated FluSure, or a PBS sham vaccine and challenged according to the timeline (a). An HI titer on mice sera was performed to examine the antibody response to the challenge virus strains after a single immunization (n = 10; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons compared to the epigraph group) (b). Mice were challenged intranasally (n = 10) with 104 TCID50 of Ohio/2011 (c), 105 TCID50 of Manitoba/2005 (d), or 103.5 TCID50 of Colorado/1977 (e) and monitored for weight loss over 14 days. Mice that reached 25% weight loss were humanely euthanized. Three days post infection, five mice per group were sacrificed to examine lung viral titers by TCID50 and qPCR (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons compared to the epigraph group). Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM).Full size imageAfter challenge with the Ohio/2011 strain (cluster IV-A), only epigraph vaccination completely protected mice from weight loss (Fig. 4c). In contrast, the TX98, FluSure, and PBS vaccinated mice lost 8–12% of their body weight by day 3. The FluSure vaccine contains a similar cluster IV-A strain and, although mice were not protected from initial weight loss, the mice showed faster recovery by day 8 as compared to the PBS vaccinated mice (p < 0.0001). In addition, epigraph vaccinated mice showed significantly reduced day 3 lung viral titers as compared to the TX98, FluSure, and PBS vaccinated mice (Fig. 4c).Challenge with the Manitoba/2005 strain (cluster IV) resulted in severe weight loss for the FluSure and PBS vaccinated mice, whereas epigraph and TX98 vaccinated mice were protected from weight loss (Fig. 4d). However, epigraph vaccinated mice showed the lowest lung viral titers on day 3 post challenge as compared to the three other vaccine groups. Interestingly, although both epigraph and TX98 vaccination protected from weight loss, there were significantly higher lung viral titers in the TX98 vaccinated group, supporting that weight loss does not always correlate with lung viral titer24,25.Lastly, we were challenged with the highly divergent Colorado/1977 strain. All vaccination groups lost weight early after the challenge, however, epigraph and TX98 vaccinated mice showed significantly reduced weight loss by day 6 as compared to the FluSure and PBS vaccinated mice (Fig. 4e; p < 0.001). Since epigraph and TX98 vaccination does not induce detectable anti-Colorado/1977 antibody responses, the early weight loss but the increased recovery could be a result of T cell-mediated protection. Again, epigraph vaccinated mice showed significantly lower lung viral titers on day 3 as compared to the TX98, FluSure, and PBS vaccination mice (Fig. 4e).Epigraph vaccination leads to cross-reactive antibody and T-cell responses against multiple human H3 strainsReverse zoonosis, the transmission of influenza virus from human-to-swine, is a key factor in driving the diversity of IAV-S in swine1,26,27. Therefore, we wanted to determine if our swH3 epigraph vaccine might induce cross-reactive immune responses to human H3 (huH3) isolates to reduce reverse zoonotic events. We selected a panel of 7 huH3 strains to evaluate cross-reactive antibody responses by HI assay. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to examine the relationship of these seven strains to the vaccine strains (Fig. 5a). Epigraph vaccination led to strong antibody titers ≥40 to 3 of the 7 (43%) huH3 strains (Fig. 5b). TX98 vaccination resulted in antibody titers ≥40 to 2 of the 7 (29%) strains and is closely related to both strains (>95.9% identity; Fig. 5a, Supplementary Table 3). In contrast, FluSure vaccination did not result in cross-reactive antibody responses to any of the huH3 isolates.Fig. 5: Cross-reactive immune correlates and protection to human H3 isolates.(To determine the cross-reactive immune responses of the swH3 vaccines to huH3 isolates, a panel of 7 representative huH3 strains were selected. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed to visualize the relationship of these huH3 assay strains with the swH3 vaccine immunogens (a). An HI titer was performed against these huH3 strains with sera from BALB/c mice vaccinated in Fig. 2 (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons compared to the epigraph group) (b). A heat map of these HI titers was constructed to further visualize the total cross-reactive antibody response of each vaccine. Splenocytes isolated from vaccinated mice were also examined for cross-reactive cellular immune responses to three huH3 strains using an IFNγ ELISpot. T-cell epitopes against the Mississippi/1985, Aichi/1986, and Texas/1977 strains were mapped using an overlapping peptide array. Peptide responses >50 spot-forming cells (SFC) per million were considered positive. Positive peptides for each vaccine and their relative location on the HA protein are indicated (c). The peptide number designates the position of the last amino acid in the peptide on the total HA protein. The level of response seen against each positive peptide is reported as SFC per million splenocytes with the dotted line indicating the 50 SFC/million cutoff (d). The total T-cell response to each virus peptide array is shown for all vaccination groups (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons) (e). BALB/c mice (n = 10) were vaccinated with 1010 vp of HAdV-5-epigraph or HAdV-5-TX98, the commercial inactivated vaccine FluSure, or a sham PBS vaccine and then challenged 3 weeks later with 104.3 TCID50 of Texas/1977 (f). Mice were monitored for weight loss and sacrificed humanely when 25% weight loss was reached. Five mice per group were sacrificed on day 3 post infection to examine lung viral titer by TCID50 and qPCR (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons compared to the epigraph group). Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM).Full size imageWe also evaluated cross-reactive T-cell responses to three huH3 strains (Mississippi/1985, Aichi/1968, and Texas/1977) using an IFNγ ELISPOT with overlapping peptide arrays. T-cell mapping was performed as described with the swH3 isolates. Interestingly, epigraph vaccination induced a T-cell response against a single immunodominant epitope conserved in all three huH3 isolates (Fig. 5c, d). This epitope is the same position as the immunodominant epitope induced against the swH3 isolates (amino acid position 120–128). In the huH3 population, the amino acids in this epitope are highly conserved (~94% conserved in the huH3 population; Supplementary Fig. 2). TX98 vaccination did not induce a T-cell response against this immunodominant epitope and FluSure vaccination did not result in a significant T-cell response against any of the huH3 strains. Epigraph vaccination also resulted in significant total T-cell responses against all three huH3 isolates (Fig. 5e).To determine if the huH3 cross-reactive immune responses resulted in protection, we challenged vaccinated mice with a mouse-adapted huH3 Texas/1977 isolate. BALB/c mice (n = 10) were vaccinated with a single shot of 1010 vp of HAdV-5-epigraph or HAdV-5-TX98, FluSure, or a PBS sham vaccine. Mice were then challenged 3 weeks later with the Texas/1977 challenge strain. Only epigraph vaccination completely protected mice from weight loss and death (Fig. 5f). In contrast, TX98 vaccinated mice lost >16% of their starting body weight before starting to recover. FluSure and PBS vaccinated mice quickly lost weight and were all humanely euthanized by day 7 post infection. Epigraph vaccination also reduced infectious virus in the lungs below the level of detection on day 3 as measured by TCID50 (Fig. 5f).Epigraph vaccination in swine induced strong cross-reactive antibody and T-cell responsesLastly, to confirm that the results seen in mice translated to the target animal, we vaccinated 3-week-old pigs intramuscularly with 1011 vp of our HAdV-5-epigraph vaccine and compared the immune responses to swine vaccinated with 1011 vp of the HAdV-5-TX98 wild-type comparator or the commercial vaccine FluSure at the manufacture’s recommended dose. Three weeks later, serum was collected to examine the antibody response after a single immunization (Fig. 6a). A single immunization of the epigraph vaccine led to strong cross-reactive antibody titers ≥40 to 13 out of 20 (65%) swH3 strains, with significantly higher antibody responses to 11 out of 20 of the swH3 strains tested, as compared to the TX98 and FluSure groups. Importantly, the epigraph vaccine resulted in cross-reactive antibodies (≥40) to 11 of the 13 (85%) North American strains and both 2010 human-like strains after only a single immunization. In contrast, TX98 only resulted in strong antibody titers (≥40) to the matched Texas/1998 strain and FluSure vaccination did not result in significant titers to any of the swH3 after a single immunization.Fig. 6: Immune responses to swH3 strains after vaccination in swine.To confirm that the cross-reactive immune responses observed after epigraph vaccination in mice translated to the target animal, 3-week-old swine (n = 5) were vaccinated with 1011 vp of HAdV-5-epigraph or HAdV-5-TX98 or the commercial inactivated vaccine FluSure according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pigs were bled 3 weeks later to examine the antibody response after a single shot and then boosted with the same vaccine and dose. Two weeks after boosting, swine were humanely sacrificed. Sera from the single shot (a) or after boosting (b) was analyzed using an HI assay against the 20 swH3 representative strains. Cluster or lineage designation can be seen above the HI titer bars (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons compared to the epigraph group). A heat map of these HI titers was constructed to further visualize the total cross-reactive antibody response of each vaccine. PBMCs were isolated to determine the total T-cell response against four representative swH3 strains (Ohio/2011, Manitoba/2005, Texas/1998, and Colorado/1977) using an IFNγ ELISpot (epigraph n = 4; TX98 and FluSure n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons) (c). Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM).Full size imagePigs were boosted with the same vaccine and dose 3 weeks after priming and sacrificed 2 weeks later to examine immune correlates at peak immunity. A second immunization boosted cross-reactive antibody titers in epigraph vaccinated pigs, with titers ≥40 to 15 of the 20 (75%) strains (Fig. 6b). In addition, epigraph vaccination showed significantly higher antibody titers to 15 of the 20 strains as compared to TX98 vaccination and significantly higher antibody titers to 10 of the 20 strains as compared to FluSure vaccination. In contrast, after boosting, the TX98 vaccinated pigs showed strong antibody titers (≥40) to 5 of the 20 (25%) swH3 strains, with the strongest antibody titer against the matched Texas/1998 strain. The strongest antibody responses induced after boosting with FluSure were against similar strains to the vaccine, the cluster IV-A viruses and the matched FluSure virus (Minnesota/2012; cluster IV-B). Interestingly, boosting with FluSure also increased the cross-reactive antibody responses across the swH3 panel, with titers ≥40 to 15 of the 12 (75%) strains. However, the responses to most unmatched viruses were significantly lower than responses after epigraph immunization, with an average of 4-fold lower HI titers. Indeed, a single immunization of HAdV-5-epigraph resulted in comparable cross-reactive antibody levels as two FluSure immunizations.To confirm that the cross-reactive antibody responses as measured by HI assay were also functionally neutralizing, we performed a microneutralization assay. Neutralization titer patterns matched those seen in the HI assay, confirming the functionality of these cross-reactive antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 3). PMBCs were also collected 2 weeks after boosting to examine the cellular immune response using an IFNγ ELISpot. Epigraph vaccination induced the strongest total T-cell response to all four swH3 strains tested (Fig. 6c). TX98 vaccination resulted in a strong T-cell response against the matched Texas/1998 strain but only modest cross-reactive T-cell levels to the other three swH3 strains. FluSure vaccination did not result in detectable cross-reactive T-cell responses.The post vaccination swine serum was also examined for the presence of cross-reactive antibodies to the panel of 7 huH3 isolates. After a single immunization, epigraph resulted in strong cross-reactive antibody titers ≥40 to 3 of the 7 (43%) huH3 viruses, the same viruses exhibiting cross-reactivity in the mouse model (Fig. 7a). In contrast, TX98 vaccination resulted in antibody titers ≥40 to 1 of the 7 (14%) huH3 strains and FluSure vaccination did not show any cross-reactive antibodies to the huH3 isolates after a single immunization. After a second immunization, the cross-reactive antibody levels in all three vaccine groups increased (Fig. 7b). Boosting with epigraph resulted in strong antibody titers ≥40 to 6 of the 7 (86%) of the huH3 viruses, while TX98 and FluSure boosting results in antibody titers ≥40 to 3 of the 7 (43%) and 4 of the 7 (57%) huH3 viruses, respectively. However, epigraph showed significantly higher antibody titers to 3 of the 7 isolates as compared to both TX98 and FluSure vaccination.Fig. 7: Immune responses to human H3 strains after vaccination in swine.The sera from the vaccinated swine (n = 5) were analyzed for cross-reactivity to huH3 strains using an HI assay against the panel of representative 7 huH3 strains. Antibody responses were examined after a single shot (a) or boosting (b) and a heat map of these HI titers was constructed to further visualize the total cross-reactive antibody response of each vaccine (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons compared to the epigraph group). Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM).Full size imageDiscussionIn this study, we evaluated the Epigraph vaccine designer algorithm for the immunogen design of broadly cross-reactive swH3 HA to create a universal swH3 vaccine. The ideal IAV-S vaccine would induce protective immunity after a single immunization while also providing broad protection against ever-evolving field strains28,29. Here, we demonstrated that our epigraph vaccine induced strong cross-reactive antibody responses to a panel of diverse swH3 viruses which represented a large portion of the swH3 diversity. After a prime-boost immunization in mice, the epigraph vaccine induced strong cross-reactive antibody titers to 14 of the 20 highly divergent swH3 viruses. In contrast, the TX98 and FluSure vaccine showed limited cross-reactivity outside of the strains contained in each vaccine. The greater cross-reactive immunity induced by epigraph vaccination in mice was further supported by immunization studies in swine. Importantly, a single immunization with epigraph resulted in strong cross-reactive antibody titers whereas vaccination with TX98 or FluSure showed limited antibody development against unmatched strains. This data suggests that the HAdV-5-epigraph vaccine could be implemented as a broadly cross-reactive vaccine that requires only a single immunization for induction of strong immunity.Importantly, epigraph vaccination showed the greatest cross-reactive antibody response against North American strains, with antibody titers ≥40 to 11 of the 13 (85%) North American strains and both 2010 human-like strains after only a single immunization in swine. However, epigraph vaccination showed lower cross-reactivity against the four Eurasian strains and the historical human-like Colorado/1977 which localizes near the Eurasian strains. This is likely a consequence of fewer Eurasian sequences in the database, as only ~11% of the downloaded sequences used to construct the epigraph vaccine were of Eurasian origin. Consequently, the North American strains comprised a large majority of the original sequence population and, as the goal of the Epigraph vaccine designer algorithm is to create a cocktail of immunogens designed to maximize potential epitope coverage in a population, the resulting constructs best cover the North American strains. Therefore, the current epigraph vaccine construct would be attractive as a broadly cross-reactive vaccine in North American swine herds, but the design of an alternative construct might be required to protect Eurasian swine herds.Interestingly, after the second immunization in swine, the FluSure vaccine showed an increase in breadth of antibody responses. However, the magnitude of the responses against unmatched strains was on average 4-fold lower compared to boosting with the epigraph vaccine. The FluSure vaccine contains two strains of swH3 and an oil-in-water adjuvant which could contribute to the increased antibody breadth observed after boosting24,30. Importantly, this data demonstrates that a boost is essential for the development of significant antibody responses in vaccination with FluSure. However, inactivated vaccines with oil-in-water adjuvants have been implicated in the development of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) when the vaccine and challenge strain HA are mismatched24,31. Therefore, exploring alternative vaccine platforms that protect against heterologous infection without resulting in VAERD is greatly needed in the goal of a universal IAV-S vaccine. Here we use an HAdV-5 vector which was previously shown to reduce viral shedding without causing VAERD after challenge with a mismatch IAV-S strain32. In addition, HAdV-5 vectored vaccines in swine have shown efficacy in the presence of maternally derived antibodies which limit the efficacy of inactivated vaccines33,34,35,36. In this study, we demonstrated that the HAdV-5-epigraph swH3 vaccine induces high titers of cross-reactive antibodies after only a single immunization in swine. In contrast, the HAdV-5-TX98 vaccine induced relatively strain-specific immunity with limited cross-reactivity. Therefore, while an Adenovirus vector can induce strong immunity after only a single immunization, the computational design of the epigraph vaccine contributes to the induction of cross-reactive antibodies.Vaccination against IAV-S has two direct benefits: (1) reduction of clinical disease in pigs to prevent economic losses and (2) reduction of viral shedding to decrease transmission within the herd28. This reduced viral shedding also reduces the potential for spill-over infections to humans. Our challenge studies in mice have shown that epigraph vaccination, in addition to reducing weight loss, also resulted in the greatest reduction in lung viral titers after challenge with three highly diverse swH3 viruses as compared to the other vaccine groups. This reduction in viral titer could lead to reduced viral shedding and, thereby, reduced intra- and inter-species transmission. However, challenge studies in swine are needed to support the cross-protective efficacy seen hereafter epigraph vaccination in mice.The transmission of the influenza virus from human-to-swine contributes to the viral diversity of IAV-S26,37. Here, we have shown that epigraph vaccination leads to cross-reactive antibody titers to multiple huH3 isolates after vaccination in both mice and swine. Importantly, a single immunization of epigraph in swine resulted in cross-reactive antibody titers to 3 of the 7 huH3 isolates while a single immunization with TX98 or FluSure only induced antibody titers to 1 or 0 of the 7 huH3 isolates, respectively. In addition, the epigraph vaccine-induced cross-reactive T-cell responses in mice and completely protected mice from weight loss and death after challenge with a lethal huH3 strain. This data indicates that a single immunization with the swH3 epigraph could protect pigs from several strains of huH3, however, challenge studies in swine are needed to confirm this.In addition to strong cross-reactive antibody responses, the HAdV-5-epigraph vaccine induced strong broadly cross-reactive T-cell immunity against both swine and human influenza viruses. In mice, we detected an immunodominant T-cell epitope, predicted to be a cytotoxic T lymphocyte CD8 epitope, along with multiple subdominant T-cell responses, likely CD4 T helper (Th) cells. Additionally, epigraph vaccination of swine induced a significant total T-cell response against four divergent swH3 strains. In humans, cross-reactive T cells and the development of memory T cells have been associated with long-lasting immunity against influenza virus38,39,40,41. In contrast, the role of T cells during influenza infection in swine has not been as well defined. Previous studies in swine have demonstrated cross-protection against divergent IAV-S strains in the absence of detectable antibodies42,43,44,45. This suggests a role for cross-reactive T-cell responses in the protection against IAV-S which could also result in long-term durable immunity. However, while the role of T cells in protection against influenza virus infection in humans has been demonstrated, further studies to fully elucidate the role of T-cell responses for protection against influenza infection in swine are needed. In addition, longevity studies in pigs will be required to establish the durability of the epigraph vaccine-induced immunity.Here, we have demonstrated the efficacy of the Epigraph vaccine designer tool in the development of a broadly cross-reactive swH3 influenza vaccine. Our results not only provide a promising swine vaccine, but also a model for human influenza. Indeed, influenza infection in swine shares many similarities with influenza infection in humans, such as similarities in clinical symptoms, distribution of viral receptors in the respiratory tract, and subtypes of influenza causing endemic infections46. Therefore, swine make an excellent model for the development and testing of universal influenza vaccines. With our promising results, the epigraph design could be applied to human influenza strains to create a human universal influenza vaccine candidate. Additionally, future studies could explore the contribution of each individual epigraph construct towards the induction of cross-reactive immunity. In this study, we demonstrated broadly cross-reactive humoral and cellular immunity after vaccination with an epigraph in both murine and swine models. These data support the development of an epigraph vaccine as a universal swH3 vaccine capable of providing cross-protection against highly divergent strains of swH3.MethodsEthics statementAll biological procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln (Protocol: 619). Female BALB/c mice ages 6–8 weeks were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Outbred male and female pigs aged 3 weeks were purchased from Audubon Manning Veterinary Clinic (AMVC).

The following viruses were generous gifts from our collaborators: A/swine/Texas/4199-2/1998 (Texas/1998) strain from Dr. Hiep Vu, A/swine/Colorado/1/1977 (Colorado/1977) strain from Dr. Richard Webby, and the A/swine/Kansas/11-110529/2011 (Kansas/2011) strain from Dr. Wenjun Ma. The following swine influenza viruses were obtained from the USDA Swine Surveillance Influenza A virus isolates repository: A/swine/Minnesota/A01270872/2012 (Minnesota/2012), A/swine/Colorado/23619/1999 (Colorado/1999), A/swine/Wyoming/A01444562/2013 (Wyoming/2013), A/swine/Minnesota/A01432544/2013 (Minnesota/2013), A/swine/Indiana/A01202866/2011 (Indiana/2011), and A/swine/Texas/A01785781/2018 (Texas/2018). The viruses A/swine/Italy/1385-1/1995 (Italy/1995), A/swine/North Carolina/35922/1998 (North Carolina/1998), A/Ohio/28/2016 (Ohio/2016), A/swine/Denmark/101501-1/2011 (Denmark/2011), A/swine/Italy/520/1985 (Italy/1985), A/swine/Hong_Kong/4/1976 (Hong Kong/1976), A/swine/Nebraska/4B-1113-P15/2013 (Nebraska/2013), and A/swine/Minnesota/3908-2/2011 (Minnesota/2011) were generously assayed by collaboration with Dr. Richard Webby. The Manitoba/2005, Colorado/1977, and Ohio/2011 swine influenza viruses were mouse adapted through serial lung passaging in mice seven times.The following human influenza viruses were obtained from the Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Repository: A/Texas/1/1977 (Texas/1977) [NR-3604], A/Mississippi/1/1985 (Mississippi/1985) [NR-3502], A/Aichi/2/1968 (Aichi/1968) [NR-3483], A/Beijing/4/1989 (Beijing/1989) [NR-3495], A/Nanchang/933/1995 (Nanchang/1995) [NR-3222], A/Ann_Arbor/3/1993 (Ann Arbor/1993) [NR-3524], and A/Mississippi/1/1985 (Mississippi/1985) [NR-3502]. The Texas/1977 influenza virus was mouse adapted through serial lung passaging in mice five times. All swine and human viruses were grown in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated eggs and the chorioallantoic fluid was stored at −80 °C. Viruses were quantified based on HAU and TCID50.Design and characterization of the epigraph immunogensThe epigraph vaccine immunogens were designed using the Epigraph Vaccine Designer at the Los Alamos National Laboratories17,18. First, all unique swH3 hemagglutinin (HA) sequences (duplicates excluded) were downloaded from the Influenza Research Database as of April 25th, 2017. This resulted in 1561 HA sequences that were then uploaded to the Epigraph Vaccine Designer and run with the following parameters: epitope length: 9, cocktail size: 3. The resulting cocktail of three HA epigraph genes was added back to the swH3 sequence population and aligned using ClustalW. Between the 1,561 swH3 HA sequences, the greatest difference in percent identity was 76.4%. Because we included over 1500 sequences in the analysis, we used a Neighbor-Joining strategy to build the phylogenetic tree using the Jukes–Cantor model with a Blosum62 cost matrix on the Geneious 11.1.5 software. The cluster designation for each swH3 strain was determined based on previous reports in the literature47 and location of the phylogenetic tree relative to reference strains. Phylogenetic trees to compare the assay strains to the vaccine strains were created by maximum likelihood estimation using PhyML 3.3 with a Jones–Taylor–Thornton substitution model on the Geneious 11.1.5 software48.Construction of the replication-defective adenovirus vectorsThe three epigraph HA and wildtype A/swine/Texas/4199-2/1998 HA immunogens were codon optimized for swine gene expression and synthesized by GenScript. These genes were cloned into an HAdV-5 replication-defective E1/E3 deleted vector using the Ad-Easy Adenoviral Vector System (Agilent). Briefly, the HA genes were cloned in the pShuttle-CMV plasmid and cotransformed with pAd-Easy-1 (HAdV-5 genome) into BJ5183 cells for homologous recombination into the E1 region of the HAdV-5 genome. HAdV-5 recombinants were confirmed by restriction digest and sequencing and then midiprepped using the Qiagen Hi-Speed Midiprep Kit. The recombinant HAdV-5 genomes with HA inserts were linearized with PacI and buffer exchanged using a Strataprep PCR purification kit (Agilent Technologies). The linearized recombinant gDNA was transfected into 293 cells using the PolyFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). After virus rescue was observed via plaque formation, cells were harvested, and the virus was released by three freeze-thaw cycles. The virus was amplified by sequential passages in 293 cells until a final amplification using a Corning 10-cell stack (~6300 cm2). The virus was purified by two sequential CsCl ultracentrifuge gradients, desalted using Econo-Pac 10DG Desalting Columns (Bio-Rad), and stored at −80 °C. The vp were quantitated by OD260. The infectious units per mL were determined using the AdenoX Rapid Titer kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Clontech Laboratories).Western blotHA protein expression from the recombinant HAdV-5 vectors was confirmed by western blot. Confluent 293 cells were infected at an MOI of 10 and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 h. Cells were harvested, denatured using Laemmli buffer plus 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled at 100 °C for 10 min, and then passed through a QIAshredder (Qiagen). Samples were run on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked for 30 min with 5% milk in TBST before being incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA Tag HRP conjugated antibody (NB600-391; Novus Biologicals) at 1:1000 in TBST 1% milk. The membrane was washed 3✕ with TBST and developed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). A duplicate membrane was run for a GAPDH loading control and probed with anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #0411) at 1:1000 overnight at 4 °C and secondary goat anti-mouse HRP conjugated antibody (Millipore Sigma #AP308P) at 1:2000 for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) before being developed as described above.Mouse vaccination and tissue collectionFor immune correlate analysis in mice, female BALB/c mice were vaccinated with 1010 vp of either HAdV-5-epigraph (the cocktail of three epigraph immunogens at equal ratios to a total 1010 vp) or HAdV-5-TX98. The commercially available swine influenza vaccine FluSure was administered at ten times the pig equivalent dose. All vaccines were compared to a PBS sham vaccinated control group. All immunizations were performed intramuscularly with a 27-gauge needle into both quadriceps in two 25 µl injections. At 3 weeks post vaccination, mice were bled from the submandibular vein and boosted with the homologous vaccine and dose. Two weeks later, all mice were terminally bled via cardiac puncture and spleens were harvested for analysis of cellular immune response. Sera was isolated from whole blood using a BD Microtainer Blood Collection Tube (Becton Dickinson). To isolated splenocytes, spleens were passed through a 40 μm Nylon cell strainer (BD Labware) and red blood cells were lysed using ACK lysis buffer. Splenocytes were resuspended in cRMPI with 10% FBS and used for ELISpot assays. All mice immunizations and bleeds were performed under isoflurane or ketamine and xylazine induced anesthesia.Swine vaccination and tissue collectionFor immune correlate analysis in swine, outbred male and female pigs aged 3 weeks were purchased from AMVC. Pigs were pre-screened for swine influenza exposure using an influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) ELISA and confirmed negative. The pigs were randomly divided into three groups of five and acclimated for 4 days prior to vaccination. Pigs were vaccinated with 1011 vp of HAdV-5-epigraph or HAdV-5-TX98 intramuscularly. FluSure animals were vaccinated according to the manufacturer’s instructions with a 2 mL dose intramuscularly. Three weeks later, animals were bled to examine antibody development after a single shot of vaccine and then boosted with the same vaccine and dose as the prime. Sera was isolated from whole blood using BD Vacutainer Serum Separator Tube (Becton Dickinson). Two weeks after boosting, animals were sacrificed to examine humoral and cellular immune correlates. Sera were collected to examine antibody development. In addition, whole blood was collected for isolation of PBMCs using a syringe pre-loading with EDTA. Whole blood was diluted 1:1 with sterile DPBS, gently added on top of lymphocyte separation media (Corning #25072CV), and spun at 400 g for 30 min. The PBMC layer was collected, washed with RPMI, and then residual red blood cells lysed with ACK lysis buffer. PBMCs were resuspended in cRMPI with 10% FBS and used for ELISpot assays.Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assaySera from mice and swine were incubated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE; (370013; Denka Seiken)) at a 1:3 ratio (sera: RDE) overnight at 37 °C followed by inactivation at 56 °C for 30 min. Sera was further diluted to a starting ratio of 1:10 with DPBS before use in the HI assay. Serum was serially diluted two-fold in a 96 well V-bottom plate before an equal volume (25 μL) of four hemagglutination units (HAU) of virus was added to each well. After incubation at RT for 1 hr, 50 μL of 0.5% chicken red blood cells were added to each well and hemagglutination patterns were read after 30 min.ELISpot assayThe T-cell response to vaccination was analyzed using an IFNγ ELISpot assay. Peptide arrays of the HA protein of swine influenza virus strain Ohio/2011, Manitoba/2005, Texas/1998, and Colorado/1977 were synthesized by GenScript. These peptide arrays spanned the entire HA protein of each strain and consist of 17-mers with 10 amino acid overlap. Peptide arrays of the HA protein of human influenza virus strain Texas/1977, Mississippi/1985, and Aichi/1968 were also synthesized by GenScript and were 17-mers with 12 amino acid overlap. Potential immunogenic peptides were identified using a matrix of peptides pools, and the epitopes were confirmed using individual peptides. For ELISpot assays on mice splenocytes, 96-well polyvinylidene difluoride-backed plates (MultiScreen-IP, Millipore) were coated with 50 μl of anti-mouse IFN-γ mAb AN18 (5 µg/ ml; Mabtech) overnight at 4 °C before being washed and blocked with cRMPI 10% FBS for 1 hr at 37 °C. To re-stimulate splenocytes, single-cell suspension of mouse splenocytes was added to each well and an equal volume (50 μL) of peptide (5 μg/mL) was added to the splenocytes. These plates, containing splenocytes re-stimulated with peptide, were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 to allow for IFNγ production. Plates were then washed 6× with PBS and incubated with 50 μL of biotinylated anti-mouse IFN-γ R4-6A2 mAb (1:1000 dilution; Mabtech) diluted in PBS with 1% FBS for 1 h at RT. Plates were washed 6✕ with PBS and incubated with 50 µl of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:1000 dilution; Mabtech) diluted in PBS 1% FBS. After 1 h at RT, the plates were washed 6✕ with PBS and developed by adding 100 µl of BCIP/NBT (Plus) alkaline phosphatase substrate (Thermo Fisher). Development was stopped by washing several times in dH2O. The plates were air dried and spots were counted using an automated ELISpot plate reader (AID iSpot Reader Spectrum). Results are expressed as an SFC per 106 splenocytes. Swine ELISpot assays on PBMCs were performed as described above, however, plates were coated with 50 μL of anti-porcine IFN-γ mAb pIFNγ-I (5 µg/ ml; Mabtech). After overnight incubation of the swine PBMCs with peptides to allow for re-stimulation and IFN-γ production, plates were incubated with 50 μL of biotinylated anti-porcine IFN-γ mAb P2C11 (1:1000 dilution; Mabtech). One pig in the epigraph group was excluded from the ELISpot analysis due to cell viability loss. The MHCI binding predictions were made on 3/5/2020 using the IEDB analysis resource Consensus tool22.Influenza challenges in miceBALB/c mice (n = 10) were vaccinated with 1010 vp of the HAdV-5-epigraph or HAdV-5-TX98 vaccine, the inactivated vaccine FluSure, or with PBS sham vaccine intramuscularly. After 3 weeks, the mice were challenged intranasally with either 104 TCID50 of Ohio/2011, 105 TCID50 of Manitoba/2005, 103.5 TCID50 of Colorado/1977, or 104.3 TCID50 of Texas/1977. On day 3 post challenge, five mice from each group were sacrificed and the lungs were collected to examine lung viral titers by TCID50 and qPCR. The remaining five mice were monitored for weight loss and were euthanized when they lost 25% of their starting weight.Tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)Mouse lungs from day 3 post influenza challenge were homogenized in PBS, centrifuged at 21,000 g for 10 min, and the lung supernatant collected. The lung supernatant sample was diluted 1:10 in a 96 well U bottom tissue culture dish and serially diluted 10-fold before adding 100 μL of 2 × 105 cells/mL of MDCK cells to each well. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and then washed one time with sterile DPBS before adding DMEM with 0.0002% trypsin to each well. The plates were then incubated another 3 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2 before adding 50 μL of 0.5% chicken red blood cells to each well and reading the hemagglutination patterns after 30 min.qPCR lung viral load quantificationRNA was extracted from day 3 post challenge lung supernatant using the PureLink Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Real time-qPCR was performed using the Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (NEB) run on a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the following cycling conditions: 55 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 2 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Results were compared to a standard curve created using RNA extracted from a known quantity of infectious virus of Manitoba/2005. The universal primer probe set for Influenza A (BEI Resources, NR-15593, NR-15594, NR-15595) was used.Microneutralization titerSera was heat inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min and then 2-fold serially diluted in a sterile 96 well U bottom before the addition of 50 TCID50 of virus per well. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, 100 μL of MDCK cells (2 × 105 cells/mL) were added to each well. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and then washed one time with sterile DPBS before adding DMEM with 0.0002% trypsin to each well. The plates were then incubated another 3 days at 37 °C with 5% CO2 before adding 50 μL of 0.5% chicken red blood cells to each well and reading the hemagglutination patterns after 30 min.Statistical analysisGraphPad Prism software was used to analyze all data. Data are expressed as the mean with standard error (SEM). HI titers, T-cell data, and lung viral titers were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001).Reporting summaryFurther information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.

Less is known about heterotypic co-infections between influenza A (IAV) and influenza B (IBV) viruses. Previous publications showed that IAV replication was suppressed upon co-infection with IBV. However, the effect of heterotypic co-infections on IBV replication was not investigated. To do so, we produced by reverse genetics a pair of replication-competent recombinant IAV (A/WSN/33) and IBV (B/Brisbane/60/2008) expressing a GFP and mCherry fluorescent reporter, respectively. A549 cells were infected simultaneously or 1 h apart at a high MOI with IAV-GFP or IBV-mCherry and the fluorescence was measured at 6 h post-infection by flow cytometry. Unexpectedly, we observed that IBV-mCherry infection was enhanced upon co-infection with IAV-GFP, and more strongly so when IAV was added 1 h prior to IBV. The same effect was observed with wild-type viruses and with various strains of IAV. Using UV-inactivated IAV or type-specific antiviral compounds, we showed that the enhancing effect of IAV infection on IBV infection was dependent on transcriptioneplication of the IAV genome. Our results, taken with available data in the literature, support the hypothesis that the presence of IAV proteins can enhance IBV genome expression and/or complement IBV defective particles. Introduction Influenza A (IAV) and influenza B viruses (IBV) are responsible for seasonal epidemics that cause significant mortality and morbidity in humans each year. Two IAV subtypes, A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), and two IBV lineages, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria, are currently co-circulating in the human population (Krammer et al., 2018). The circulation pattern differs depending on the influenza season; indeed, the predominant circulating virus may belong to one or the other IAV subtype or IBV lineage. Influenza B infections generally account for approximately 25% of cases annually and usually peak later than IAV infections during seasonal epidemics (Caini et al., 2019). The clinical severity of IBV infections is equivalent to that of IAV (Su et al., 2014), with a higher prevalence of IBV in the pediatric population. IAV and IBV are described to co-circulate during seasonal epidemics among other respiratory viruses (Nickbakhsh et al., 2019). Infection by more than one type of virus is described as a co-infection, with the specific term superinfection being used when one virus infects the host or the cell before a second superinfecting virus. Co-infections can lead to virus-virus interactions which can in turn alter viral replication, disease severity and disease epidemiology (reviewed in Kumar et al., 2018; Saade et al., 2020). Despite several studies that have investigated the frequency of homotypic or heterotypic influenza co-infections in human respiratory samples, co-infections with IAV and IBV have only occasionally been reported in vivo (reviewed in Pérez-García et al., 2016; Gregianini et al., 2019). A retrospective case-control study from flu seasons 2009 to 2018 in Brazil found that the frequency of heterotypic co-infections was less than 0.4% annually in the years during which co-infections were detected (Gregianini et al., 2019). However, in 2017, the frequency of heterotypic co-infections reached 1.3% and was associated with a high frequency of A(H3N2) and IBV co-circulation, thus increasing the chance of co-infection (Gregianini et al., 2019). In this context, the clinical significance of mixed influenza virus infection is not well understood, and its relation to the disease severity is unclear. The outcome of co-infections was found to be associated with increased severity in some studies (Gregianini et al., 2019) but not in others (Pérez-García et al., 2016). IAV and IBV both belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and share close phylogenic relationship. Their genomes consist of eight single-stranded, negative-sense viral RNA (vRNA) segments, each bound to oligomers of nucleoprotein (NP) and associated with the three subunits of the viral polymerase complex (PB2, PB1, and PA) to form viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) (Krammer et al., 2018). During the viral life cycle, vRNPs enter the host cell nucleus where they are transcribed into capped and polyadenylated viral mRNAs by a cap-snatching mechanism. Upon translation and nuclear import of vRNP components, new rounds of transcriptioneplication take place. Replication of vRNPs occurs via the synthesis of full-length complementary RNAs which then serve as templates for the synthesis of vRNAs. Newly synthetized vRNPs are then exported in the cytoplasm and transported to the sites of viral assembly where the correct set of eight segments is incorporated into progeny virions (Dou et al., 2018). Homotypic co-infections with influenza viruses are essential to increase genetic diversification, to drive viral evolution and to allow genetic complementation. Less is known about heterotypic co-infections between IAV and IBV. Because of the segmented nature of their genomes, co-infection of the same cell by several viral particles can lead to genetic reassortment, i.e., the exchange of gene segments between co-infecting viruses (Lowen, 2017). Although intratypic reassortments frequently occur between IAV subtypes or IBV lineages in vivo, intertypic reassortments between IAV and IBV have never been detected in nature or successfully generated in vitro (McCullers et al., 2004; Baker et al., 2014; Krammer et al., 2018), most likely because of incompatible protein functions and of incompatible packaging signals between the IAV and IBV vRNPs (Muster et al., 1991; Baker et al., 2014). Several reports have indicated that, upon co-infection of cells in vitro, IBV impairs the replication of IAV, a phenomenon called intertypic or heterotypic interference (Tobita and Ohori, 1979; Mikheeva and Ghendon, 1982; Kaverin et al., 1983; Aoki et al., 1984). Mechanistically, it has been shown that the NP of IBV (NPB) can inhibit IAV polymerase activity through binding to its type A counterpart (NPA) thus disrupting interaction between NPA and PB2, preventing IAV polymerase complex formation and ultimately leading to the growth suppression of co-infecting IAV (Wanitchang et al., 2012; Jaru-ampornpan et al., 2014; Narkpuk et al., 2017). Other mechanisms may also contribute to intertypic interference such as inefficient assembly/functionality of a heterotypic polymerase complex (Iwatsuki-Horimoto et al., 2008; Wunderlich et al., 2010). Most studies so far have focused on IBV interference on IAV replication, and have suggested that IAV interference on IBV infection was less pronounced (Tobita and Ohori, 1979; Mikheeva and Ghendon, 1982; Kaverin et al., 1983; Aoki et al., 1984). Here, in order to gain further insight into the mutual interference between IAV and IBV, we developed an original system using recombinant viruses harboring a fluorescent reporter in co-infection experiments and analyzed the outcome using flow cytometry on infected cells. Unexpectedly, we observed a significantly enhanced infection of IBV upon co-infection with IAV, whether IAV infection was initiated before, simultaneously or after IBV infection. This effect was confirmed with wild-type viruses and various strains of IAV. We further showed that UV-inactivation or inhibition of IAV transcriptioneplication with specific drugs abolished the capacity of IAV co-infection to enhance IBV infection. Materials and Methods Cells, Drugs and Viruses Human embryonic kidney 293T (ATCC® CRL-3216) and human alveolar epithelial A549 (ATCC® CCL-185) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Madin-Darby Canine Kidney MDCK (ATCC® CCL-34) cells were grown in Modified Eagle’s Medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% FCS. Nucleozin (Sigma-Aldrich) and pimodivir (CliniSciences) were added to the medium (1 μM and 50 nM, respectively) at the time of infection. The A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), A549-adapted A/Bretagne/7608/2009 (H1N1pdm09) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Victoria) viruses were produced by reverse genetics as described in Fodor et al. (1999), Biquand et al. (2017), and Nogales et al. (2017) and amplified at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0001 on MDCK cells. A/WSN/33 expressing GFP (referred to as IAV-GFP) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 expressing mCherry (referred to as IBV-mCherry) were produced by reverse genetics using a modified PB2 reverse genetics plasmid as described below. 293T and MDCK cells were used for the production of recombinant viruses by reverse genetics. MDCK cells were used for the amplification and titration of viral stocks. All co-infections experiments were performed on A549 cells as they are more relevant than MDCK cells for influenza infection experiments. Plasmids The monodirectional reverse genetics pPolI-WSN-PB2-2A-GFP plasmid was obtained by subcloning a sequence encoding the 2A peptide from porcine teschovirus-1 followed by a flu-codon-optimized GFP coding sequence into the pPolI-WSN-PB2-2A-Nanoluc plasmid described in Diot et al. (2016) (Figure 1A). The bidirectional reverse genetics plasmid pDP2002-Bris-PB2 was modified using overlapping PCR and synthetic genes in order to duplicate the last 153 nucleotides of the PB2 open reading frame and introduce silent mutations in the region actually encoding the PB2 protein followed by NotI / SpeI restriction sites. The pDP2002-Bris-PB2-2A-mCherry was obtained by subcloning a sequence encoding the 2A peptide from porcine teschovirus-1 followed by a flu-codon-optimized mCherry coding sequence between the NotI / SpeI restriction sites (Figure 1A). All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Production and characterization of IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry recombinant viruses.

Production of Recombinant Viruses by Reverse Genetics For IAV, the eight pPolI-WSN-PB2, -PB1, -PA, -HA, -NP, -NA, -NS, -M, and four pcDNA3.1-WSN-PB2, -PB1, -PA, -NP plasmids (0.5 μg of each) were co-transfected into a sub-confluent monolayer of co-cultivated 293T and MDCK cells (4 × 105 and 3 × 105 cells, respectively, seeded in a 6-well plate) using 10 μL of FuGENE® HD transfection reagent (Promega) with 90 μL of Opti-MEM® (Gibco). After 24 h of incubation at 35°C, cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated in DMEM containing 1 μg/mL of tosyl-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 h at 35°C. Supernatants were harvested and clarified by centrifugation 5 min at 2,500 g before being aliquoted and stored at −80°C. The same protocol was used for IBV using the eight pDP2002-Bris-PB2, -PB1, -PA, -HA, -NP, -NA, -NS, -M bidirectional plasmids and the pCI-Bris-PB2 plasmid (1 μg of each) with 24 μL of FuGENE® HD and 76 μL of Opti-MEM®. The efficiency of reverse genetics was evaluated by titrating the supernatant on MDCK cells by plaque assay as described in Matrosovich et al. (2006). Recombinant viruses were agarose plaque-purified and amplified at a MOI of 0.0001 on MDCK cells in DMEM containing 1 μg/mL of TPCK-treated trypsin for 3 days at 35°C. Quantification of Viral RNAs Viral RNAs were extracted using the QIamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) from 140 μL of viral stocks. Viral RNAs were quantified by RT-qPCR using the SuperScript III Platinium One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). For IAV, the M segment was detected using the following primers and probe: 5′-CTTCTAACCGAGGTCGAAACGTA-3′, 5′-GGTGA CAGGATTGGTCTTGTCTTTA-3′ and 5′(HEX)-TCAGGCCCC CTCAAAGCCGAG-(BHQ-1)3′. For IBV, the HA segment was detected using the following primers and probes: 5′-AC CCTACARAMTTGGAACYTCAGG-3′, 5′-ACAGCCCAAGCC CAAGCCATTGTTG-3′, 5′(FAM)-AAATCCAATTTTRCTGGT AG-(BHQ-1)3′ and 5′(FAM)-AATCCGATTTTRCTGGTAG-(BHQ-1)3′. Standard curves were obtained by subjecting in vitro-transcribed IAV-M or IBV-HA vRNAs to RT-qPCR in parallel. The following program was used on a Light Cycler480 instrument (Roche): 45°C for 15 min, 95°C for 3 min, 50 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 55°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 20 s, then 40°C for 30 s. Viral Replication Kinetics MDCK cells were seeded on 96-well plates with 2 × 104 cells/well. One day later, cells were infected at a MOI of 0.001 with 50 μL of inoculum. Following 1 h of adsorption at 35°C, cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with 100 μL of DMEM containing 0.5 μg/mL of TPCK-treated trypsin. Plates were then incubated at 35°C for 24, 48, or 72 h. Viral supernatants collected at different time points were titrated on MDCK cells by plaque assay as described in Matrosovich et al. (2006). Western-Blot Analysis A549 and MDCK cells were seeded on 96-well plates with 2.5 × 104 cells/well. One day later, cells were infected at a MOI of 3 with 50 μL of inoculum. Following 1 h of adsorption at 35°C, cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with 100 μL of DMEM containing 10% FCS. Plates were then incubated at 35°C for 3, 6, or 9 h. Protein extracts were prepared in Laemmli buffer, separated on 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Hybond®, Amersham). Immunoblot membranes were incubated with primary antibodies directed against NP (AAH5, Abcam, 1/5,000 for IAV; B017, Abcam, 1/1,000 for IBV) or GAPDH (Pierce) and revealed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) and the ECL2 substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The chemiluminescence signals were acquired using a G-Box and the GeneSnap software (SynGene). Virus Inactivation Four hundred microliters of IAV-GFP in a 35 mm dish were exposed to UV irradiation (8 cycles of 1 mJ/cm2; UVC 500 UV Crosslinker, GE Life Sciences). Virus inactivation was assessed by absence of detectable fluorescent cells upon infection of A549 cells and absence of plaque upon titration by plaque assay. Detection of Heterotypic Co-Infections by Flow Cytometry A549 cells were seeded on 96-well plates with 2 × 104 cells/well. One day later, cells were infected at a high MOI with 50 μL of (i) a mixture of IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry (Figure 2A), (ii) IBV-mCherry (Figure 2B), or (iii) IAV-GFP (Figure 2C). Following 1 h of adsorption at 4°C, cells were washed twice with cold DMEM and incubated with 100 μL of Opti-MEM® for 1 h at 35°C. Cells were then washed twice with DMEM and 50 μL of (i) DMEM, (ii) IAV-GFP, or (iii) IBV-mCherry at a high MOI were added. Following 1 h of adsorption at 35°C, cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with 100 μL of Opti-MEM® for 6 h at 35°C. Infected cells were detached with 30 μL of trypsin (Gibco) for 15 min at 37°C, incubated with 120 μL of DMEM containing 5% FCS and then transferred to 150 μL of PBS containing 8% formaldehyde. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, fixed cells were centrifuged 5 min at 1,500 g, washed once in PBS and resuspended in 200 μL of PBS. Fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry (Attune NxT, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The MOI was 3 Plaque Forming Units (PFU)/cell for IAV-GFP and between 3 and 25 PFU/cell (corresponding to ∼ 5 × 103 physical particles/cell) for IBV-mCherry, depending on the viral stock, to obtain 50–80% GFP-positive and 20–60% mCherry-positive cells, respectively, at 6 h post-infection. All experiments with fluorescent viruses were carried out in biological triplicates. FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Experimental setup for heterotypic co-infections between IAV and IBV. (A) For simultaneous co-infections, A549 cells were infected with a mixture of IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry using a MOI of 3 for each virus. After 1 h of adsorption at 4°C, unbound viruses were removed by washing and cells were further incubated for 6 h at 35°C. For sequential co-infections, IBV-mCherry (B) or IAV-GFP (C) were first added on A549 at a MOI of 3 for 1 h at 4°C, unbound viruses were removed by washing and cells were incubated for 1 h at 35°C to allow virus entry. At 1 hpi, cells were infected at a MOI of 3 with IAV-GFP (B) or IBV-mCherry (C). After 1 h of adsorption at 35°C, unbound viruses were removed by washing and cells were further incubated for 6 h at 35°C. Cells were then fixed and the fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. In parallel, control infections were performed where one of the co-infecting viruses was omitted (either the first or the second one). Green and red hatched bars: IAV-GFP + IBV-mCherry; green hatched or solid bars: IAV-GFP; red hatched or solid bars: IBV-mCherry; hatched bars on white background: incubation at 4°C; hatched bars on gray or colored background and solid bars: incubation at 35°C. For IBV-mCherry, the indicated MOI refers to the stock presented in Figure 1 (MOI of 3 PFU/cell, corresponding to ∼ 5 × 103 physical particles/cell). For other stocks of IBV-mCherry, an amount of ∼5 × 103 physical particles/cell was used to obtain between 20 and 60% of mCherry-positive cells at 6 h post-infection. The same protocol was applied with IAV and IBV wild-type viruses, except that infected cells were detected using flow cytometry upon NP-labeling. Briefly, A549 cells were seeded on 24-well plates with 2 × 105 cells/well and infected as described above. After the last centrifugation step, cells were permeabilized for 6 min using PBS-1% Triton X100, washed three times with PBS-1% FCS, and incubated 10 min with PBS-1% FCS. Cells were then labeled with primary antibody directed against NPA (AAH5, Abcam, 1/5,000) or NPB (B017, Abcam, 1/1,000) for 1 h at 4°C followed with AF488-secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1/250) for 1 h at 4°C. After the last centrifugation step, cells were resuspended in PBS and fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 8 software. Data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The Shapiro-Wilk’s test was used to assess the normal distribution of the data before using parametric tests. Statistical significance was determined by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunn-Sidak’s multiple-comparison test, or three-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test, as specified in the figure legends. Results Production and Characterization of IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry Recombinant Viruses We used flow cytometry to quantitatively evaluate viral interference upon heterotypic co-infections with IAV and IBV. To this end, we produced a pair of recombinant IAV (A/WSN/33) and IBV (B/Brisbane/60/2008) expressing a fluorescent protein from the PB2 segment, using a similar approach as described in Tran et al. (2013), Fulton et al. (2015), and Diot et al. (2016). Briefly, a flu-codon-optimized sequence encoding GFP or mCherry was inserted at the C-terminal end of the PB2 coding sequence from IAV or IBV, respectively, downstream of a 2A proteolytic cleavage site from porcine teschovirus-1. To ensure the conservation of the packaging signals at the 5′ end of the viral genomic segment, the last 109 or 153 nucleotides coding for the PB2 protein of IAV or IBV, respectively, were duplicated and inserted after the stop codon of the fluorescent protein. Silent mutations were introduced in the PB2 coding sequence to avoid an exact sequence duplication and prevent genetic instability of the recombinant viruses (Figure 1A). IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry were rescued by reverse genetics and viral stocks were obtained after amplification at a MOI of 0.0001 on MDCK cells from plaque-purified viruses. Both IAV and IBV reporter viruses grew to high viral titers (1.2 × 108 and 3.8 × 106 PFU/mL, respectively, Figure 1B, solid bars), close to the ones obtained with their wild-type counterparts (∼107 PFU/mL, data not shown). The concentration of physical viral particles was estimated by RT-qPCR quantification of the M and HA segment copy numbers for IAV and IBV, respectively (Figure 1B, hatched bars). The physical to infectious particles ratio was about 160:1 and 1,600:1 for IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry, respectively, indicating a higher proportion of non-infectious particles in the IBV-mCherry viral stock. The growth characteristics of IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry were next assessed on MDCK and A549 cells. Under multicycle growth conditions on MDCK cells, both IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry grew efficiently and at a similar rate, reaching a peak of 6 × 107 PFU/mL and 4 × 107 PFU/mL, respectively, at 48 h post-infection (hpi) (Figure 1C). Under the same conditions, IBV-mCherry grew very poorly on A549 cells (data not shown). However, under single-cycle growth conditions, both IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry were found to infect A549 cells efficiently. Indeed, when A549 cells were infected at a MOI of 3 and NP expression was assessed in cell lysates prepared at 3, 6, and 9 hpi, both the NPA and NPB proteins were detectable at 6 hpi and were strongly expressed at 9 hpi, a pattern very similar to the one observed in MDCK cells (Figure 1D). A549 infected at a high MOI with IAV-GFP or IBV-mCherry were also analyzed at 6 hpi by flow cytometry, and between 52–86% and 16–57% of the cells expressed GFP or mCherry fluorescent proteins, respectively (see below). Based on these data, we chose to use A549 cells under conditions of single-cycle infection to further explore the viral interference between IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry. Mutual Effects of Influenza A and B Virus Upon Heterotypic Co-infection To assess the mutual effects of IAV and IBV upon co-infection, we co-infected A549 cells with IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry by adding the two viruses either simultaneously or 1 h apart, as described in the “Materials and Methods” section and in Figure 2. For the purpose of simplicity, the term co-infection will be used below for both simultaneous and temporally separated co-infections. In parallel, control mock-infections were performed where one or the other co-infecting virus was omitted. Cells were then fixed and the fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry (Figure 3). FIGURE 3 Figure 3. Effect of heterotypic co-infections between IAV and IBV. A549 cells were co-infected, either simultaneously (A,D) or sequentially (B,E,C,F), with IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry at a MOI of 3 PFU/cell for each virus and analyzed 6 h after the addition of the last virus using flow cytometry. (A–C) The solid bars represent the proportion of fluorescent cells expressing GFP (in green) or mCherry (in red) upon control infection with IAV-GFP or IBV-mCherry alone. The hatched bars represent the proportion of fluorescent cells expressing GFP (in green) or mCherry (in red) upon co-infections. (D–F) The corresponding median fluorescence intensities are shown. (A,D) Simultaneous co-infection with IAV-GFP and IBV-mCherry viruses. (B,E) Primary infection with IBV-mCherry followed 1 hpi with IAV-GFP infection. (C,F) Primary infection with IAV-GFP followed 1 hpi with IBV-mCherry infection. One experiment representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate is shown (see Supplementary Figure S1). The mean ± S.D. of biological triplicates is shown. Two-way ANOVA test: multiple comparison, Dunn-Sidak test, α = 0.05; ****: adjusted p ≤ 0.0001. When cells were infected with IAV-GFP alone, the proportion of GFP-positive cells varied from 52 to 86%, depending on the experiment (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S1, green solid bars). When IBV-mCherry was added, regardless the timing of addition, the proportion of GFP-positive cells was significantly decreased with a proportion of positive cells between 0.2 and 20%, as expected from previous reports (Tobita and Ohori, 1979; Mikheeva and Ghendon, 1982; Kaverin et al., 1983; Aoki et al., 1984; Wanitchang et al., 2012; Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S1, green hatched bars). The inhibitory effect of IBV on IAV infection was more pronounced if IBV-mCherry was added 1 h before (17-fold decrease, Figure 3B) or at the same time (27-fold decrease, Figure 3A) than 1 h after (3.9-fold decrease, Figure 3C) IAV-GFP. The same trend was observed when the mean fluorescence intensities were recorded (Figures 3D–F). Similar results were obtained in two other experiments (Supplementary Figure S1). When cells were infected with IBV-mCherry alone, the proportion of mCherry-positive cells varied from 16 to 57%, depending on the experiment (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S1, red solid bars). Unexpectedly, when IAV-GFP was added, the proportion of mCherry-positive cells was significantly increased with a proportion of positive cells between 43 and 84%, depending on the experiment and the time of addition (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S1, red hatched bars). The effect was stronger when IAV-GFP was added 1 h prior to IBV-mCherry (3.8-fold increase, Figure 3C) than when added 1 h after (2.1-fold increase, Figure 3B) or simultaneously (2.1-fold increase, Figure 3A). Similar results were obtained in two other experiments (Supplementary Figure S1). Variations in the proportions of positive-cells corresponded to similar variations in fluorescence intensities (Figures 3D–F), suggesting that the replicative capacity is impacted upon co-infection. A concomitant effect on infectivity cannot be excluded. Therefore, IAV and IBV exert opposite effects on each other’s viral replication upon heterotypic co-infection. While IBV-mCherry infection inhibits IAV-GFP infection, IAV-GFP infection enhances IBV-mCherry infection. To our knowledge, this gain in IBV infection upon IAV co-infection has never been described so far. We therefore focused on this aspect in the following experiments, using the condition which gave the strongest enhancing effect, i.e., infection with IAV 1 h prior to infection with IBV. Enhanced IBV Infection Mediated by IAV Is Not Strain Specific To determine whether the observed effect was IAV-strain specific, the same protocol as above was used, using A/WSN/33, A/PR/8/34 or A/Bretagne/7608/2009 for the initial IAV infection, followed with a secondary IBV-mCherry infection (Figure 4A). IAV-infected cells were detected following NPA labeling and IBV-infected cells were detected upon mCherry-expression. In control infections, the proportion of NPA-positive cells (Figure 4A, green solid bars) was similar for A/WSN/33 (76%) and A/PR/8/34 (75%), but lower for A/Bretagne/7608/2009 (20%). In the presence of IBV-mCherry, the proportion of NPA-positive cells was reduced for all three strains (Figure 4A, green hatched bars). In sharp contrast, the proportion of IBV-infected, mCherry-positive cells was increased in the presence of all three IAV strains (Figure 4A, red hatched bars) compared with control infection (Figure 4A, red solid bars). Notably, the increase in mCherry-positive cells was similar in the presence of A/WSN/33, A/PR/8/34, or A/Bretagne/7608/2009 although the proportion of NPA-positive cells was lower upon infection with the A/Bretagne/7608/2009 virus, suggesting a less efficient NPA-labeling by the monoclonal antibody for the latter. Similar results were obtained in two other experiments (Supplementary Figures S2A,B). These data demonstrate that the increase of IBV infection upon heterotypic co-infection is not IAV-strain specific. FIGURE 4 Figure 4. Effect of heterotypic co-infections using different strains of IAV. (A) A549 cells were infected with IAV strains A/WSN/33, A/PR/8/34 or A/Bretagne/7608/2009 for 1 h and then infected with IBV-mCherry for 6 h. Infected cells were labeled for the NP protein from IAV and analyzed by flow-cytometry for NPA or mCherry expression. The solid bars represent the proportion of fluorescent cells expressing NPA (in green) or mCherry (in red) upon control infections with one of the indicated IAV strains or IBV-mCherry alone, respectively. The hatched bars represent the proportion of fluorescent cells expressing NPA (in green) or mCherry (in red) upon co-infections. One experiment representative of three independent experiments performed in monoplicate is shown (see Supplementary Figures S2A,B). (B) A549 cells were infected for 1 h with A/WSN/33 and then infected with B/Brisbane/60/2008 for 6 h. Infected cells labeled for the NP protein of IBV were detected by flow cytometry. The solid bars represent the mean or median fluorescence intensity upon control infection with B/Brisbane/60/2008 alone. The hatched bars represent the mean or median fluorescence intensity upon co-infection with A/WSN/33 and B/Brisbane/60/2008. One experiment representative of two independent experiments performed in monoplicate is shown (see Supplementary Figure S2C). a.u., arbitrary units. We then asked whether our observations could be reproduced using both a wild-type IAV and a wild-type IBV. A549 cells were infected at a MOI of 3 with A/WSN/33 for 1 h and then with B/Brisbane/60/2008 for 6 h, following the same protocol as in Figure 2C. To detect IBV-infected cells by flow-cytometry, the NPB protein was labeled using a specific monoclonal antibody as described in the “Materials and Methods” section. Because this resulted in a proportion of NPB-positive cells close to 100%, we used fluorescence intensity as a read-out to assess the effect of IAV co-infection. The mean and median fluorescence intensities were both increased in co-infected cells (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S2C, red hatched bars) compared to cells infected with IBV alone (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S2C, red solid bars). This observation provided confirmation that the recombinant reporter viruses represent a reliable tool to study the mutual effects of IAV and IBV upon co-infection. Infectious IAV Is Required to Enhance IBV Infection We compared an infectious IAV-GFP and a UV-inactivated IAV-GFP in heterotypic co-infections experiments (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S3), to assess whether a fully infectious IAV was required to enhance IBV infection, or whether bystander molecule(s) secreted by the MDCK cells during IAV amplification and present in the IAV stock used for co-infection could possibly account for the enhanced IBV infection. The proportion of mCherry-positive cells was increased when cells were co-infected with IBV-mCherry and IAV-GFP (79%, Figure 5, hatched bars) as compared to cells infected with IBV-mCherry alone (51%, Figure 5, solid bars), as expected. In the presence of the UV-inactivated IAV-GFP, no such increase was observed and the proportion of mCherry-positive cells was similar as upon single infection with IBV-mCherry (43%, Figure 5, squared bars). Similar results were obtained in another experiment (Supplementary Figure S3). These results indicate that the enhancement of IBV infection observed upon heterotypic co-infection is not merely due to a soluble factor secreted by infected MDCK cells and present in the IAV stock but requires a replicative IAV. FIGURE 5 Figure 5. Effect of UV-inactivated IAV on IBV infection. A549 cells were infected for 1 h with IAV-GFP or an UV-inactivated IAV-GFP (IAV-GFP-UV) and then with IBV-mCherry for 6 h and analyzed by flow cytometry. The solid bar represents the proportion of mCherry-positive fluorescent cells upon control infection with IBV-mCherry alone. The hatched bar represents the proportion of mCherry-positive cells upon co-infections. The squared bar represents the proportion of mCherry-positive cells upon co-infection with IAV-GFP-UV and IBV-mCherry.

Two-way ANOVA test: multiple comparison, Dunn-Sidak test, α = 0.05; ns, not significant; ****: adjusted p ≤ 0.0001. IAV Transcription/Replication Steps Are Needed to Enhance IBV Infection To gain further insight into the steps of the IAV life cycle required for IBV infection potentiation, we performed heterotypic co-infection experiments in the presence of antiviral compounds specific to IAV and that do not affect IBV (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure S4). Nucleozin, by interacting with NPA, triggers its aggregation, prevents its nuclear accumulation, and therefore inhibits IAV replication (Kao et al., 2010). Pimodivir targets the PB2 subunit of IAV, prevents its binding to the cap structure, and therefore inhibits cap snatching and IAV transcription (Clark et al., 2014). Both antiviral compounds were used at concentrations corresponding to ∼15-fold the EC50 concentration (1 μM for nucleozin and 50 nM for primodivir). They were added separately during the IAV adsorption step and maintained on cells during all the experiment. Two different stocks of IBV-mCherry were used (Figures 6A,B). Upon single infection with IAV-GFP, the proportion of GFP-positive cells in the presence of nucleozin (0.2%) or pimodivir (0.2%) was significantly decreased compared with the control (82%), thus confirming that nucleozin and pimodivir efficiently inhibit IAV replication at these concentrations (Figure 6, green solid bars). Upon single infection with IBV-mCherry, the percentage of mCherry-positive cells (Figure 6, red solid bars) was not significantly different between untreated (29 and 39%, Figures 6A,B) and nucleozin (25 and 34%, Figures 6A,B) or pimodivir (23 and 31%, Figures 6A,B) treated cells, in agreement with the specificity of the two drugs toward IAV. FIGURE 6 Figure 6. Effect of IAV-specific antiviral compounds on heterotypic co-infections. A549 cells were infected with IAV-GFP for 1 h and then with an IBV-mCherry virus from two different stocks (A,B) in the presence or absence of the antiviral compounds nucleozin (1 μM, NZ) or pimodivir (50 nM, PI). At 6 hpi, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The solid bars represent the proportion of fluorescent cells expressing GFP (in green) or mCherry (in red) upon control infection with IAV-GFP or IBV-mCherry alone. The hatched bars represent the proportion of fluorescent cells expressing GFP (in green) or mCherry (in red) upon co-infections. One experiment representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate is shown (see Supplementary Figure S4). The mean ± S.D. of biological triplicates is shown. Three-way ANOVA test: multiple comparison, Tukey test, α = 0.05; ns, not significant; ****: adjusted p ≤ 0.0001. Upon IAV-IBV co-infection, while for untreated cells the proportion of IBV-mCherry-positive cells was increased (77 and 82%, Figures 6A,B) compared to cells infected with IBV alone (29 and 39%, Figures 6A,B), no such increase was observed in nucleozin- or pimodivir- treated-cells (40–44% and 33–36% mCherry-positive cells in co-infected cells, respectively, compared to 29–39% for cells infected with IBV alone) (Figures 6A,B, compare red hatched and solid bars). Similar results were obtained in two other experiments (Supplementary Figure S4). These results indicate that transcriptioneplication of IAV or a later step is required to enhance IBV infection upon heterotypic co-infection. Discussion In this study, we developed an original and efficient system to investigate the effects of heterotypic co-infections between IAV and IBV using fluorescent reporter viruses of both viral types. Viral interference is the situation whereby the replication of one virus interferes with the replication of another virus. It has been shown from earlier studies that IBV interferes with IAV replication (Tobita and Ohori, 1979; Mikheeva and Ghendon, 1982; Kaverin et al., 1983; Aoki et al., 1984; Wanitchang et al., 2012). Wanitchang et al. (2012) have shown that infection with a wild-type B/Lee/40 or B/Maryland/2/59 virus inhibited the replication of a recombinant IAV harboring a DsRed reporter gene in the A/PR/8/34 background. However, they did not assess the effect of IAV on IBV infection. Here, we applied a strategy similar to the one used previously to engineer recombinant IAV or IBV from the B/Yamagata lineage (Diot et al., 2016; Biquand et al., 2017) to produce a recombinant mCherry-expressing IBV in a B/Brisbane/60/2008 background (B/Victoria lineage). We set up experimental conditions in which IBV-mCherry infection of A549 cells resulted in the detection of 20–60% of mCherry-positive cells at 6 hpi, which allowed us to assess quantitatively the mutual interference between IAV and IBV. Using our system to study heterotypic interference, we showed that IAV and IBV exert opposite effects on each other. Indeed, our study confirms previous published data showing that IBV strongly suppressed IAV infection (Tobita and Ohori, 1979; Mikheeva and Ghendon, 1982; Kaverin et al., 1983; Aoki et al., 1984; Wanitchang et al., 2012) but reveals, interestingly, that IAV has the ability to enhance IBV infection. Based on previously published data showing that productive co-infections could only occur if the interval between the two infections did not exceed ∼2 h (Dou et al., 2017), we performed either simultaneous infections or infections 1 h apart. Differences in the kinetics of viral entry can affect the outcome of co-infections. It has been shown from studies in single cells that the entry and fusion of influenza viruses occur rapidly (∼10 min) and that vRNPs are imported into the nucleus in less than 1 h (Dou et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2019). The fact that we observed the same trends whether co-infections were performed simultaneously or whether one virus was added 1 h before or 1 h after the other suggests that a delay in entry kinetics is not a major determinant. The proportion of IAV-GFP-positive cells was decreased 4.8—42-fold upon IBV co-infection, with the strongest effect observed upon simultaneous co-infection. This is in agreement with previous data showing that if IAV infection occurred 2 h prior to infection with IBV, IBV could no longer suppress IAV replication (Wanitchang et al., 2012). The mechanism allowing the inhibition of IAV infection upon IBV co-infection was shown to involve the binding of NPB to NPA and the subsequent inhibition of IAV genome transcriptioneplication (Wanitchang et al., 2012; Jaru-ampornpan et al., 2014). While it has been shown that NPB expression suppressed IAV polymerase activity, addition of NPA did not significantly inhibit IBV polymerase activity (Wanitchang et al., 2012; Baker et al., 2014). This is consistent with our observation of an absence of a symmetrical negative interference of IAV on IBV infection. On the contrary, in our experiments the proportion of IBV-mCherry-positive cells was enhanced 1.8—2.5-fold upon IAV co-infection. The gain in IBV infection upon co-infection with IAV was observed with different stocks of IBV-mCherry, with wild-type IBV, and with various strains of IAV from the H1N1 subtype, therefore excluding that the observed effect is IBV-stock-dependent or IAV-strain-dependent. We then tried to explore by which mechanisms IAV increases IBV infection. Enhancement of IBV-mCherry infection was the strongest when IAV infection was initiated 1 h before IBV-mCherry infection, however, it was also observed when IAV was added simultaneously and even 1 h after IBV-mCherry infection. Taken together with the fact that IAV infection increased not only the percentage of mCherry-positive cells, but also the mean and median mCherry fluorescence intensities which reflect the level of expression of the PB2 viral protein, a likely hypothesis is that IAV exerts its enhancing effect at the level of IBV transcriptioneplication. By using a UV-inactivated IAV-GFP or antiviral compounds targeting specific steps of the IAV life cycle, we showed that enhancement of IBV infection was no longer observed when IAV transcriptioneplication was inhibited. UV treatment induces pyrimidine dimers formation in the viral RNA genome and results in a loss of infectivity of UV-treated viruses (Delrue et al., 2012). UV-inactivated viruses can still to some extent interact with their target cells, e.g., be endocytosed, stimulate PPR, induce receptor signaling (Delrue et al., 2012). However, these properties do not account for the observed effect of IAV on IBV infection, as the enhancement of IBV infection was no longer observed with UV-inactivated IAV. This suggests that (i) the process of IAV transcriptioneplication per se and/or (ii) a viral protein resulting from the transcriptioneplication of the IAV genome, and/or (iii) a late stage of the IAV cycle may be involved in the positive interference on IBV. Our experimental design and read-out (GFP expression as a proxy for PB2 expression at 6 phi) is in favor of (i) and/or (ii), although (iii) cannot be completely excluded. Previous publications have shown that the IAV polymerase complex can recognize the promoter of IBV suggesting a functional compatibility between the type A polymerase machinery and the type B promoter (Crescenzo-Chaigne et al., 1999). Moreover, despite a limited compatibility among the polymerase subunits and nucleoprotein of both types (Iwatsuki-Horimoto et al., 2008), it was shown that none of the IAV proteins was able to block IBV polymerase activity (Wanitchang et al., 2012). It is therefore tempting to speculate that, upon co-infection, one or several IAV proteins could enhance transcriptioneplication of IBV vRNAs. The IAV proteins involved could correspond to the polymerase complex itself and/or other proteins imported back in the nucleus during IAV transcriptioneplication, such as NS1 (non-structural protein 1). Indeed, NS1 has been described to positively regulate transcriptioneplication of the IAV genome and translation of viral mRNAs (for a review on NS1, see Hale et al., 2008). NS1 proteins of IAV and IBV share limited sequence homology, yet both have the ability to counteract the type 1 and type 3 IFN responses and are essential for efficient viral growth (Dauber et al., 2004, 2006; Hai et al., 2008; Patzina et al., 2017; Nogales et al., 2019). Despite homologous functions, NS1B has been shown to not fully complement the functions of NS1A in the context of recombinant IAV viruses expressing heterotypic NS1, suggesting that other functions specific for NS1A are not present in NS1B (Nogales et al., 2019). One hypothesis is that, in the context of IAV-IBV co-infections, IAV-NS1 could exert effects similar to IAV RNAs on IBV RNAs and increase transcriptioneplication or translation of the IBV genome. This could be mediated either through an increase of the activity of the IAV polymerase or of the IBV polymerase on the IBV genome. Another mechanism could involve the complementation of IBV-defective particles by IAV. As suggested by the physical to infectious particles ratio, a higher proportion of defective particles is present in the IBV-mCherry than in the IAV-GFP viral stock. It has been shown for IAV that the susceptibility to superinfection was determined by the level of semi-infectious particles in the population (Sun and Brooke, 2018). In a similar way, semi-infectious particles in the IBV population could be rescued by the expression of IAV proteins. Using fluorescent-reporter viruses, we confirmed previous published data regarding inhibition of IAV infection by IBV. We also brought new data on influenza heterotypic co-infections showing that IBV infection can be enhanced upon IAV co-infection, and more strongly so if IAV is added prior to IBV. We also showed that IAV transcriptioneplication steps were required to enhance IBV infection. We therefore suggest that the IAV polymerase complex, while being inhibited by NPB on type A vRNP, could use type B vRNA as a template for transcriptioneplication and/or that another IAV protein could enhance the activity of IBV or IAV polymerase complex on the IBV promoter. Co-infection experiments using various IBV strains (including the B/Yamagata lineage) and IAV subtypes (including the circulating H3N2 subtype) could help further elucidate the underlying mechanism in the future. Extrapolation from our experimental evidence for enhancement of IBV infection upon co-infection with IAV to its significance in a natural setting should be cautious. In natural infections, the MOI increases as infection spreads and locally at the peak of infection it may reach high values that allow co-infections (Tao et al., 2014, 2015). It is tempting to speculate that influenza heterotypic co-infections could alter disease severity and possibly make some IBV infections become more severe. Our system could further be adapted to study co-infections between influenza viruses and other respiratory viruses, in humans or in other species such as swine. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is of major importance to study the impact of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 co-infections on disease severity and on the epidemiology of both viruses.

This was particularly evident in comparison to the number of positive blood cultures during previous seasonal epidemics of influenza. This observation raised questions about the occurrence and causative microorganisms of bacteraemia in COVID-19 patients, especially in the perspective of the widely reported overuse of antibiotics and the rising rate of antibiotic resistance.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study on blood culture results in influenza A, influenza B and COVID-19 patients presenting to two hospitals in the Netherlands. Our main outcome consisted of the percentage of positive blood cultures. The percentage of clinically relevant blood cultures, isolated bacteria and 30-day all-cause mortality served as our secondary outcomes.ResultsA total of 1331 viral episodes were analysed in 1324 patients. There was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.47) in overall occurrence of blood culture positivity in COVID-19 patients (9.0, 95% CI 6.8–11.1) in comparison to influenza A (11.4, 95% CI 7.9–14.8) and influenza B patients (10.4, 95% CI 7.1–13.7,). After correcting for the high rate of contamination, the occurrence of clinically relevant bacteraemia in COVID-19 patients amounted to 1.0% (95% CI 0.3–1.8), which was statistically significantly lower (p = 0.04) compared to influenza A patients (4.0, 95% CI 1.9–6.1) and influenza B patients (3.0, 95% CI 1.2–4.9). The most frequently identified bacterial isolates in COVID-19 patients were Escherichia coli (n = 2) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2). The overall 30-day all-cause mortality for COVID-19 patients was 28.3% (95% CI 24.9–31.7), which was statistically significantly higher (p = <.001) when compared to patients with influenza A (7.1, 95% CI 4.3–9.9) and patients with influenza B (6.4, 95% CI 3.8–9.1).ConclusionsWe report a very low occurrence of community-acquired bacteraemia amongst COVID-19 patients in comparison to influenza patients. These results reinforce current clinical guidelines on antibiotic management in COVID-19, which only advise utilization of antibiotics when a bacterial co-infection is suspected. Peer Review reports IntroductionIn December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission in China reported a few cases of pneumonia with an unknown aetiology. In these cases, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was discovered [1, 2]. On February 27, 2020, the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the Netherlands [3]. After this first case, the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread rapidly in the south of the Netherlands. The southern region emerged as the Dutch epicentre of the first wave of COVID-19, putting a large strain on the microbiology laboratories in this area. Numerous analyses of SARS-CoV-2 tests, blood cultures and respiratory samples were performed. It was observed that during this period very few blood cultures were positive as a result of relevant bacteraemia, especially in comparison to blood cultures collected during influenza seasons. This raised questions about the occurrence of bacteraemia and bacterial co-infections in COVID-19 patients.Bacterial co-infections are frequently identified in influenza infections and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality [4, 5]. It is estimated that 11–35% of all patients with an influenza infection acquire a bacterial co-infection [6]. The most frequently isolated pathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae [7]. Although the use of empiric antibiotics is only recommended when a bacterial co-infection is suspected, it is difficult for physicians to differentiate between a viral infection and bacterial co-infection [8, 9]. This contributes to a widely recognized overuse of antibiotics in patients with viral infections [6, 10, 11]. For COVID-19, little is known about the occurrence of bacterial co-infections and the causative pathogens. One small observational study in the Netherlands showed an overall co-infection rate of 16% in COVID-19 patients [12]. Gaining more knowledge on this subject is important, particularly when deciding on the appropriate antibiotic regimen. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients received empiric antibiotics prior to and during their admission to the hospital [13]. Numbers range from 31% in the Netherlands to 95% in Asia [3, 14]. Cephalosporins and broad-spectrum penicillins were most frequently prescribed in the Netherlands [13]. Unnecessary use of antibiotics has many disadvantages, especially in the view of a rising rate of antibiotic resistance [15].Studying the occurrence, causative microorganisms and outcome of bacteraemia in COVID-19 patients in comparison to influenza A and B patients will increase the knowledge about bacterial co-infections in COVID-19 and possibly refine the current guidelines on antibiotic management.MethodsStudy design and populationWe performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with an influenza A, influenza B or a COVID-19 diagnosis and analysed blood culture outcomes. Patients were enrolled from two different hospitals in the Netherlands, the Jeroen Bosch Hospital in ‘s-Hertogenbosch and Bernhoven Hospital in Uden. Patients were divided into three cohorts according to their infection status: (1) patients with an influenza A diagnosis in the influenza season 2015/2016 or 2016/2017, (2) patients with an influenza B diagnosis in influenza season 2017/2018 and (3) patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis between 28 February 2020 and 2 June 2020.Patients were included when an influenza or a COVID-19 infection was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on RNA from oropharyngeal swabs (in case of influenza) or oronasopharyngeal swabs (in case of COVID-19). Blood cultures were collected within a time interval of 48 h before and after the RT-PCR test.Included into our analysis were patients attending the emergency department, patients diagnosed with influenza or COVID-19 at outpatients clinics who were subsequently hospitalized and patients who developed fever or flu-like symptoms during early hospitalization for other medical reasons. Patients who were discharged from the emergency department were analysed as well.The following information was recorded and collected in an anonymous database: demographic data, viral diagnosis, blood culture results, names of isolated bacteria, likelihood of contamination, the hospital ward where the blood culture was collected, blood culture collection date and time and outcome of hospitalization expressed as 30-day all-cause mortality. Predominantly the data were extracted from the laboratory information system (MOLIS). Only the outcome of hospitalization was manually collected from the patient’s medical record. Bacteria were categorized as likely contaminants if they were affiliated to groups that represent commensal skin microbiota and were defined in the patient’s medical record as a contaminant by the Department of Medical Microbiology [16].The percentage of positive blood cultures served as our primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of relevant blood cultures, causative microorganisms and 30-day all-cause mortality.This study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The board of directors of both the Jeroen Bosch Hospital and Bernhoven Hospital approved this study. Additional ethical approval was granted by the Medical Ethical Review Committee Brabant (METC Brabant). Due to the collected data being held anonymously, informed consent was waived by the scientific review boards of both the Jeroen Bosch Hospital and Bernhoven Hospital for this study. Patients who had stated an objection to utilization of their medical data for scientific research in their electronic medical record were excluded from this study.Data analysisCategorical variables are displayed as frequencies and percentages. Means and standard deviations were used to report continuous variables. The categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or the Fisher’s exact test. The continuous variables were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with SPSS version 26.0 for Windows.ResultsStudy characteristicsWe examined 1635 patients who had blood cultures analysed and a diagnosis of either influenza A, influenza B or COVID-19. Some patients appeared multiple times in the list extracted from the laboratory information system due to numerous positive tests for one virus obtained during hospitalization. These patients were included only once, at the time of presentation to the hospital. Other patients were excluded due to blood cultures not collected within 48 h of viral testing. In the end, a total of 1324 patients were included. Seven patients were included twice due to being hospitalized with two different viral infections during various viral seasons. Therefore, the total number of viral episodes amounted to 1331. Among these, there were 325 influenza A infections, 328 influenza B infections and 678 COVID-19 infections. Blood cultures were collected at the emergency department in 88.2% of all viral episodes. There were no differences between the cohorts regarding median age. The frequency of males was higher in the influenza A cohort (58.2%) and in the COVID-19 cohort (65.1%). Detailed demographics are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Demographics of patients with influenza A, influenza B or COVID-19Full size tableBacteraemia and clinical outcomesThere was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.47, Table 2) in the occurrence of blood culture positivity in influenza A patients (11.4, 95% CI 7.9–14.8), influenza B patients (10.4, 95% CI 7.1–13.7) and COVID-19 patients (9.0, 95% CI 6.8–11.1). After correcting for likely contaminants, the occurrence of relevant bacteraemia in COVID-19 patients declined to 1.0% (95% CI 0.3–1.8), which was statistically significantly lower (p = 0.04) than in influenza A patients (4.0, 95% CI 1.9–6.1) and influenza B patients (3.0, 95% CI 1.2–4.9). COVID-19 patients with relevant bacteraemia were significantly older (p = 0.03, Table 3) in comparison to patients without bacteraemia. No significant difference in gender was found in COVID-19 patients with relevant bacteraemia and patients without bacteraemia. The overall 30-day all-cause mortality rate was significantly higher (p = <.001, Table 4 in patients with COVID-19 (28.3, 95% CI 24.9–31.7) compared to patients with influenza A (7.1, 95% CI 4.3–9.9) and patients with influenza B (6.4, 95% CI 3.8–9.1). When examining the 30-day mortality in patients with positive blood cultures, a significantly higher mortality (p = 0.02, Table 4) was found in patients in the influenza A cohort (18.9, 95% CI 6.3–31.5) and patients in the COVID-19 cohort (26.2, 95% CI 15.2–37.3) compared to patients in the influenza B cohort (2.9, 95% CI − 2.7-8.4). There was no statistically significant difference in 30-day all-cause mortality between the different cohorts among patients with relevant bacteraemia. Table 2 Proportion of positive blood cultures in patients with influenza A, influenza B or COVID-19Full size tableTable 3 Demographics of COVID-19 patients with relevant bacteraemia and patients without bacteraemiaFull size tableTable 4 The 30-day all-cause mortality rate in patients with influenza A, influenza B or COVID-19 stratified by blood culture resultsFull size tableCausative microorganisms of bacteraemiaA total of 135 bacteria were isolated from 132 patients with positive blood cultures in the different cohorts. Of the 64 bacterial isolates in COVID-19 patients, 57 (89.1%) consisted of coagulase-negative staphylococci and other bacterial species that can be regarded as contaminants. This percentage of contamination was higher than in influenza A (64.9%) and influenza B patients (70.6%).Escherichia coli and S. pneumoniae were the most common pathogens identified in patients with COVID-19, each accounting for 28.6% (n = 2) of bacteria causing a relevant bacteraemia. Other pathogens causing relevant bacteraemia in COVID-19 patients were: S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (all n = 1). S. pneumoniae was the most common cause of relevant bacteraemia among influenza A patients, causing 76.9% (n = 10) of all bloodstream infections in this cohort. The most frequently isolated bacteria in influenza B patients were S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, each accounting for 40.0% (n = 4) of all isolated bacteria. No bacteria seemed to be overrepresented in COVID-19 patients. The bacterial pathogens identified are further detailed in Tables 5 and 6. Table 5 Bacteria isolated from positive blood cultures stratified by infection statusFull size tableTable 6 Bacteria isolated from positive blood cultures after correcting for contamination, stratified by infection statusFull size tableDiscussionOur study showed that only 1.0% of COVID-19 patients presenting at a general hospital experienced a clinically relevant bacteraemia, compared to 4.0% in influenza A patients and 3.0% in influenza B patients. E. coli and S. pneumoniae were most frequently isolated from positive blood cultures in COVID-19 patients. The same pathogens were also common in influenza A and B patients. We reported a 30-day all-cause mortality of 28.3% in COVID-19 patients, which was statistically significantly higher than the 30-day all-cause mortality of 7.1 and 6.4% found in respectively influenza A and B patients.Our results are consistent with findings in a recent study of Sepulveda et al. [17]. They performed a large multicentre cohort analysis on patients with COVID-19 in New York. The authors reported a true bacteraemia rate of 1.6%. The most common causative microorganisms of bacteraemia in their study population were E. coli, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae complex. A study of Hughes et al. also described similar findings [18]. The authors reported an occurrence of bacteraemia of 3.2%. This percentage consisted of both hospital- and community-acquired infections. We only reported on community-acquired infections, which may explain the difference. Their most frequently isolated community-acquired pathogens were Enterobacterales, Streptococcus spp., S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. A recent study of Goyal et al. noted a bacteraemia rate of 5.6% in COVID-19 patients [19]. This is significantly higher than the 1.0% that our study reported. Like Hughes et al., these authors examined both hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections, which may explain the higher rate of bacteraemia.We reported a blood culture contamination rate of 89.1% amongst COVID-19 patients. This percentage is fairly consistent with other studies [17, 18]. This high percentage may be explained by the high workload and the recruitment of more inexperienced health care workers during the pandemic.We found a 30-day all-cause mortality of 28.3% in our COVID-19 cohort. This number is relatively high compared to recent reports from Europe that describe 30-day all-cause mortality rates ranging from 19.7 to 21.5% [20, 21]. This disparity may be attributed to the higher risk of severe disease in our study population. During the first wave of COVID-19, family doctors in our region were asked to refer only severe cases to the overloaded hospitals. Furthermore, we only included patients with COVID-19 and analysed blood cultures. The required collection of blood cultures suggests these patients experienced severe febrile illness which indicates more severe disease.Our findings on bacteraemia in influenza patients are consistent with prior studies [22, 23]. We reported a slightly lower rate of bacteraemia in influenza B patients in comparison to influenza A patients. This is in agreement with the assertion that influenza B often leads to milder disease and less co-infections when compared to influenza A [24, 25]. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate amongst influenza patients in our cohort was comparable to mortality rates mentioned in other literature [20, 26].Our findings support current guidelines on antibiotic management that do not recommend the use of empiric antibiotics in patients with COVID-19 unless there is a clear suspicion of an accompanying bacterial infection [8]. However, differentiating between viral disease and a bacterial co-infection can be a challenge for physicians. Procalcitonin levels may be of assistance in determining the likelihood of bacterial co-infection and a potential adverse outcome [27]. When a bacterial co-infection is suspected and empiric antibiotics are administered, we advise to regularly collect blood cultures and respiratory samples. The antibiotic therapy may then be de-escalated or completely terminated based on the microbiological results. These recommendations will help in preventing overuse and the occurrence of potential side-effects from antibiotics.A major strength of our study is the inclusion of over 1300 patients from two different hospitals in the Netherlands. This large sample size increases the accuracy and reliability of our results. In addition, we reported on community-acquired infections. Most studies on bacterial co-infections in COVID-19 failed to report on the setting of their study and possibly investigated hospital-acquired infections as well, which negatively affects the interpretability of their results [17, 28,29,30]. Finally, we did not experience any missing data, which minimizes the potential risk of information bias.Some limitations should be mentioned. We did not collect data on prior antibiotic use, which may have led to an underestimation of the actual occurrence of bacteraemia in COVID-19 and influenza patients. Although the sample size of this study was of a reasonably large magnitude, the actual number of patients experiencing relevant bacteraemia was quite low, subgroup analyses of the 30-day all-cause mortality are therefore unreliable. In addition, we only reported on patients with bacteraemia and did not investigate other manifestations of bacterial co-infections. Thus, these results do not represent the entirety of bacterial co-infections in influenza and COVID-19 patients.In conclusion, the proportion of clinically relevant community-acquired bacteraemia in COVID-19 patients was very low in comparison to influenza patients. These results justify the prudent use of empiric antibiotics in COVID-19 patients, when there is insufficient evidence of a bacterial co-infection.

(Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker\UGA) UGA research also uncovers disparities in ethnic acceptance of vaccine More U.S. adults reported receiving or planning to receive an influenza vaccination during the 2020-2021 flu season than ever before, according to findings from a December 2020 national survey. The survey of 1,027 adults, conducted by the University of Georgia, found that 43.5% of respondents reported having already received a flu vaccination with an additional 13.5% stating they “definitely will get one” and 9.3% stating they “probably will get one.” Combined, 66.3% have received or intend to receive an influenza vaccination. By comparison, 48.4% of adults 18 and older received the vaccine during the 2019-2020 flu season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an increase of 3.1 percentage points from 2018-2019. The survey was led by professor Glen Nowak, director of UGA’s Center for Health and Risk Communication in the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, and associate professor Michael Cacciatore, CHRC research director. The respondents came from the National Opinion Research Center’s AmeriSpeak panel, which uses a prescreened, nationally representative pool of participants to obtain rapid and projectable survey findings. “Our survey shows that most Americans have or planned to act on the advice to get a flu vaccination this season,” said Nowak. “Further, these results strongly suggest the U.S. will be crossing an important threshold this flu season, which is over half of U.S. adults getting a flu vaccination.” The survey results indicate much of the increase in flu vaccine uptake is being driven by people 60 years old and older. A total of 61.5% said they had already received the influenza vaccine in December, with another 12% stating they “would definitely get it” and 5.8% stating they “would probably get it.” Demographic differences The survey results also indicated many demographic differences when it came to having received a flu vaccination. Forty-eight percent of white respondents reported having a flu vaccination by December, compared to 35.1% of Hispanic respondents and 30.1% of Black respondents. Having already received a flu vaccination was also much higher for respondents with a college or higher education and those with annual household incomes of $75,000 a year or more. Conversely, flu vaccination uptake and plans to get a flu vaccination were lowest for those 18-29 years old, those with some college or a high school education, and those with annual incomes less than $25,000. The survey found that 50.7% of those making more than $75,000 had already been vaccinated for the flu, while only 35% of those making less than $25,000 had been vaccinated. “It was disappointing to see that significant differences by race, age, education and income persisted during a flu vaccination season that took place during a COVID pandemic,” Cacciatore said. “It’s important that we continue to learn more about why these disparities exist so we can take steps that will reduce them.” “Overall, it is good news to find that many people, particularly those at highest risk for serious flu or COVID-19 illness, followed the advice to get the flu vaccine. Hopefully, we can sustain that level of success in the years ahead,” Nowak said. “It also remains worrisome to find much lower flu vaccination rates and intentions in so many groups. We continue to have much work to do among Hispanic and Black adults and those with lower income and years of formal education when it comes to flu vaccination.” Center for Health and Risk Communication Columns Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication Research FacebookXPinterestLinkedIn You may also like Campus News Challenges in global health discussed during 2024… Campus News Experience the magic at UGA’s State Botanical Garden… Campus News A shared harvest Campus News College of Education, Boys and Girls Club host… Campus News CAES researchers prepare students to address complex… Campus News Graduate programs administrator keeps students on the… The online newspaper for the University of Georgia community Research news from across the University of Georgia Events More EventsArchives Archives Select Month November 2024 October 2024 September 2024 August 2024 July 2024 June 2024 May 2024 April 2024 March 2024 February 2024 January 2024 December 2023 November 2023 October 2023 September 2023 August 2023 July 2023 June 2023 May 2023 April 2023 March 2023 February 2023 January 2023 December 2022 November 2022 October 2022 September 2022 August 2022 July 2022 June 2022 May 2022 April 2022 March 2022 February 2022 January 2022 December 2021 November 2021 October 2021 September 2021 August 2021 July 2021 June 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 February 2021 January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005 January 2005 December 2004 November 2004 October 2004 September 2004 August 2004 July 2004 June 2004 May 2004 April 2004 March 2004 February 2004 January 2004 December 2003 November 2003 October 2003 September 2003 August 2003 July 2003 June 2003 May 2003 April 2003 March 2003 February 2003 January 2003 University of Georgia Schools and Colleges Directory MyUGA Employment Opportunities Copyright and Trademarks Privacy Website Feedback #UGA on © University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 706‑542‑3000Influenza infection as a trigger for systemic lupus erythematosus flares resulting in hospitalization | Scientific Reports Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

We evaluated the association between influenza infection and SLE flares resulting in hospitalization. SLE flares resulting in hospitalization and influenza cases were ascertained from the Korean national healthcare insurance database (2014–2018). We used a self-controlled case series design. We defined the risk interval as the first 7 days after the influenza index date and the control interval was defined as all other times during the observation period of each year. We estimated the incidence rates of SLE flares resulting in hospitalization during the risk interval and control interval and compared them using a Poisson regression model. We identified 1624 influenza infections among the 1455 patients with SLE. Among those, there were 98 flares in 79 patients with SLE. The incidence ratio (IR) for flares during the risk interval as compared with the control interval was 25.75 (95% confidence interval 17.63–37.59). This significantly increased the IRs for flares during the risk interval in both women (IR 27.65) and men (IR 15.30), all age groups (IR 17.00–37.84), with and without immunosuppressive agent (IR 24.29 and 28.45, respectively), and with and without prior respiratory diseases (IR 21.86 and 26.82, respectively). We found significant association between influenza infection and SLE flares resulting in hospitalization. Influenza infection has to be considered as a risk factor for flares in all SLE patients regardless of age, sex, medications, and comorbidities.

These flares are related to poor outcomes; it has been reported that severe flares1,2 and the number of flares3 are associated with accrual of irreversible organ damage, which links to mortality4,5,6. Thus, prevention of flares is an important target in the management of SLE.There are several known risk factors for disease flares such as ultraviolet7,8,9, infections7,10,11,12, and hormones7,13,14. Among the risk factors for disease flares, some environmental factors such as ultraviolet and infections could be modified with effort by the patient. For example, patients with SLE are recommended to use sunblock to avoid ultraviolet exposure. In addition, the risk of infection such as influenza or pneumococcus can be reduced through vaccination and personal hygiene management.Influenza is a frequently occurring infection; however, unlike for other viruses such as herpes and cytomegalovirus, influenza vaccination has been developed and are recommended annually in people with high risk. Exposure to influenza could easily occur in patients with SLE and may increase the risk of SLE flares15. The concept that the immune response to viral infection is different in patients with SLE than in healthy individuals supports the possible triggering effect of the influenza virus on SLE flares. For example, the type I interferon (IFN) system is activated to defend against viral infection in healthy individuals and is normally terminated after eradicating the pathogen16. However, a dysregulated type I IFN system in SLE stimulates continuous production of IFN through the presence of endogenous nucleic acids, which could increase disease activity in SLE16.Infections have been associated with a higher risk of SLE flares, but the impact of influenza infection on SLE flares has not been evaluated. Therefore, we conducted an assessment in a lupus cohort.ResultsBaseline characteristics of the patients in the studyThere was a total of 24,749 prevalent patients with SLE in the database between July 2014 and June 2018. Of them, 1455 patients with SLE experienced 1624 influenza infections. After the exclusion criteria were applied, 79 patients with SLE who had 83 influenza infections and 98 SLE flares resulting in hospitalization during observational period were included in the analysis according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The flow chart showing patient selection according to the exclusion criteria is provided in Fig. 1. Figure 1Patient selection flow chart. SLE systemic lupus erythematosus.Full size imageThe mean age of patients with SLE with flares resulting in hospitalization was 35.7 (SD 14.9) years and 68 (86.1%) were women (Table 1). Information regarding medications, comorbidities, previous SLE flares, and previous respiratory disease of the patients is presented in Table 1. Table 1 Baseline characteristics of 79 patients with SLE.Full size tableIncidence ratios for SLE flares resulting in hospitalization after influenza infectionThe estimated incidence ratio (IR) for SLE flares resulting in hospitalization during the risk interval as compared with the control interval was 25.75 (95% confidence interval 17.63–37.59) (Table 2). As we divided the risk interval into days 1–3 and days 4–7, the IR for SLE flares resulting in hospitalization was 21.81 (14.71–32.35) and 7.56 (3.69–15.47), respectively. That is, the effect of influenza infection on SLE flares resulting in hospitalization is stronger in the early period (days 1–3) after the influenza infection, but a similar positive association was seen in the later period (days 4–7) as well, although its effect is smaller than that in the early period.Table 2 Incidence ratios for SLE flares resulting in hospitalization after influenza infection.Full size tableSensitivity analysisAs wash-out period prior to SLE flares resulting in hospitalization was extended to 8 weeks or 12 weeks, the estimated IR for SLE flares resulting in hospitalization was 30.08 (19.98–45.29) and 28.76–18.79 44.01), which was similar to those using 4 weeks wash-out period (Table 3). Sensitivity analyses according to different control interval (preexposure or postexposure 25 weeks) and different definitions of SLE flares and influenza infection were conducted. The estimated IR for SLE flares resulting in hospitalization during the risk interval as compared with the postexposure control interval was 26.02 (22.07–30.69) and that compared with the preexposure control interval was 24.81 (20.45–30.10). As the SLE flare was limited to the use of glucocorticoid ≥ 30 mg or ≥ 50 mg, the estimated IRs for SLE flares resulting in hospitalization were not different (IR 23.54 vs. 24.95, ≥ 30 mg vs. ≥ 50 mg, respectively). In the case that influenza infection was defined with diagnosis code or medication code, the result was not different to the case wherein the influenza infection was defined with only the medication code (IR 22.73).Table 3 Sensitivity analysis of incidence ratios for SLE flares resulting in hospitalization after influenza infection.Full size tableSubgroup analysisIn both women and men, the IR for SLE flares resulting in hospitalization was higher in the risk interval than in the control interval (IR 27.65 vs. 15.30, women vs men, respectively) (Table 4). The effects of influenza infection on SLE flares resulting in hospitalization were not different according to age group and the use of immunosuppressive agent. Presence or absence of previous respiratory disease during the 6 months prior to hospitalization was not associated with an increased or decreased risk for SLE flares resulting in hospitalization after influenza infection.Table 4 Subgroup analysis of incidence ratios for SLE flares resulting in hospitalization after influenza infection.Full size tableDiscussionUsing the longitudinal data from the population-based cohort, we examined the impact of the influenza infection on SLE flares resulting in hospitalization. We found a significant impact with influenza infection on increased SLE flares resulting in hospitalization within seven days after influenza infection.The self-controlled case series design is proposed to investigate the associations between acute outcomes and transient exposures involving only cases who have experienced the outcome of interest17. One of the main advantages of the case series method is that it controls the confounders that do not vary with time over the observational periods, such as genetics, socio-economic status, and severity of underlying disease17. Thus, the self-controlled case series design, which is adjusted for factors mentioned above, is useful to identify the association between SLE flares (acute outcome) and influenza infection (transient exposure) using claims data rather than nested case–control design.SLE flares as an outcome of interest in the study was focused in the case with hospitalization for SLE activity. The SELENA SLEDAI18 shows the items that indicate severe flare. Among them, an increase in the prednisone dose to > 0.5 mg/kg/day or hospitalization indicated severe flare. Considering the factors suggested in the SELENA SLEDAI, only the cases who have SLE code as a main diagnostic code on admission as well as who have been treated with moderate to high doses of steroids were selected in the analysis. Regarding steroid dosage, we defined a steroid dose ≥ 20 mg/day as a component of flares considering moderate to severe flares. Instead, we conducted sensitivity analysis using different steroid doses such as ≥ 30 mg/day or ≥ 50 mg/day. All the results according to different dosage of steroid in the sensitivity analysis showed similar results as those of the steroid dose ≥ 20 mg/day.This study has some limitations. First, the influenza infection was not confirmed by a laboratory test but by the prescription code for oseltamivir phosphate. Therefore, in the design of our study, it is very important to ensure that patients prescribed oseltamivir phosphate are real patients with influenza infection. If patients were prescribed oseltamivir phosphate for flu-like symptoms without an influenza laboratory test, but the flu-like symptoms were found to be symptoms in the early stage of lupus flare, incidence rate of “flare triggered by flu” may have been miscalculated. In South Korea, however, it is common practice in the medical institutions to perform an influenza diagnostic test prior to oseltamivir phosphate prescription. South Korea has a different medical system than other countries, and people with influenza infection can easily access physicians and be prescribed oseltamivir phosphate. Rapid result report of influenza diagnostic test (10 min to 2 h) and reasonable cost of influenza diagnostic test let both patients and doctors conduct the influenza diagnostic test prior to oseltamivir phosphate prescription. In addition, Korean insurance guidelines are presented to prescribe oseltamivir in influenza confirmed patients or strongly suspected patients who have certainly respiratory symptoms except fever. Fever is a common symptom but respiratory symptoms are not common in early stage of lupus flare. The possibility that patients prescribed oseltamivir phosphate do not have real influenza infection is very low in Korean medical circumstance.Second, we did not consider intravenous peramivir as a medication code for influenza. Peramivir is not covered by insurance and is therefore not identified in claims data in South Korea. However, peramivir is usually prescribed as a second line medication or is limited to patients who find it difficult to take medicine. Nevertheless, it is possible that patients with influenza treated with peramivir were missing.Considering these two limitations, we further conducted sensitivity analysis with influenza infection defined using a diagnosis code or medication code, which showed a significant association between influenza infection and SLE flares resulting in hospitalization as the main result in the study.Lastly, adherence to medication, which is one of the possible risk factors for flares, was not considered due to limitation of claims data. Compared to the case–control study design, however, this effect is thought to be small as this study was conducted in only cases.In conclusion, we found a significant association between influenza infection and SLE flares resulting in hospitalization. Possibility of increased risk for SLE flares resulting in hospitalization within seven days after influenza infection has to be considered when treating and educating patients with SLE.MethodsEthics statementThis study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) of St. Vincent’s Hospital, Catholic University of Korea (VC17ZESI0103). All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. The need for written informed consent was waived by the IRB of St. Vincent’s Hospital, Catholic University of Korea because data were de-identified and collected retrospectively.Data sourceA population-based SLE prevalent cohort from July 2014 to June 2018 was constructed using the Korean national healthcare insurance (KNHI) database. All people in South Korea are eligible for coverage under the KNHI Program. This database contains individual information about healthcare service usage (diagnostic code, length of stay, treatment costs, services received) and prescription records (drug code, days prescribed, daily dosage).Definitions of SLE, SLE flares resulting in hospitalization, and influenza infectionSLE, SLE flares, and influenza infection were identified using the diagnostic code or/and prescription code or/and medical care utilization code in the KNHI database.The diagnosis of SLE was made based on the diagnostic code for both SLE International Classification of Disease (ICD)-10 code M32 and rare intractable disease (RID) code V136. The RID is a registration system operated by the KNHI. Only SLE patients who fulfil the 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)19 or the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)20 classification criteria are registered in the RID system by physicians, mainly rheumatologists.As the outcome, SLE flares resulting in hospitalization was defined based on two components. That is, among the SLE patients with both ICD-10 code M32 and RID code V136, SLE flares resulting in hospitalization was defined in the cases that were both hospitalized for more than two days and prescribed corticosteroids ≥ 20 mg/dl for more than one day.Influenza infection was defined in the cases that have prescription code for oseltamivir phosphate, which is a medication for influenza treatment (358901ACH, 358902ACH, 358903ACH, 358907ACH, 358907ASS, 358908ASS, 358909ASS, 358910ASS). The index date is the first day to be prescribed oseltamivir phosphate in the influenza season. As influenza tends to occur during autumn to spring and to peak in winter, each period of influenza season in the study was defined from July in the year to June in the next year (e.g. Jul 2014 to Jun 2015 or Jul 2016 to Jun 2017).Inclusion and exclusion criteriaWe included the SLE patients who fulfilled the SLE operational definition and have experienced influenza infection after being diagnosed with SLE. Among the patients with SLE treated from July 1st 2014 to June 30th 2018, patients with SLE who did not have any SLE flares resulting in hospitalization within 26 weeks before or 26 after influenza infection were excluded. Moreover, SLE flares resulting in hospitalization within 4 weeks after a previous hospitalization for flares were excluded as the repeated flares within a short period could be an incomplete cure of the first flare. Lastly, only one patient who had repeated influenza infection during the same influenza season was excluded (the gap between first and second influenza index date was 38 days).Study designThis is a historic cohort study and was conducted to investigate the association between influenza infection (a transient exposure) and SLE flares (an acute outcome). To exclude the effects of possible confounding factors on the outcome of interest, self-controlled case series design was used in this study (Fig. 2). The risk interval was defined as the first 7 days from the index date of influenza infection. The control interval was defined as all other times during the observation period. In the case that the index date of influenza infection is January 1st 2016, for example, the risk interval is from January 1st to January 7th and the control interval is from July 1st 2015 to June 30th, except for the 7 days of risk interval. The control interval was divided into the preexposure and postexposure control interval. Preexposure control interval means for the 26 weeks before the influenza index date and postexposure means for the 25 weeks after the last day of risk interval.Figure 2Study design. This study was conducted using the self-controlled case series design. The index date of influenza infection is the first day to be prescribed oseltamivir phosphate. The number of SLE flares resulting in hospitalization are counted on a yearly (52 weeks) basis. Risk interval was defined as the first 7 days from the index date of influenza infection. The control interval was defined as all other times during the observation period of each influenza season. SLE systemic lupus erythematosus.Full size imageStatistical analysisBased on a self-controlled case series analysis, which could investigate a transient exposure and an acute outcome within only “case” individuals who have experienced the outcome of interest with fixed effects covariates17, we estimated the incidence rates of SLE flares resulting in hospitalization during risk interval and control interval and compared them using a fixed-effects conditional Poisson regression model. The model allows auto-correlation and can be used in the data having multiple exposure and outcome occurrences21,22.A sensitivity analysis further conducted to confirm the robustness of our results. First, wash-out period prior to SLE flares resulting in hospitalization was extended to 8 weeks or 12 weeks to ensure that each hospitalization is a new episode of flare, not a partially treated prior episode. Second, control interval was limited to preexposure 26 weeks or postexposure 25 weeks to identify that previous influenza infection have remote effect on lupus flares. Third, SLE flares resulting in hospitalization were limited to the use of corticosteroid ≥ 30 mg or ≥ 50 mg. Lastly, influenza infection was defined as cases with either the influenza diagnosis code or oseltamivir phosphate medication code.We performed subgroup analysis according to the age group (< 16 years, 16–49 years, and ≥ 50 years), sex, use of immunosuppressive agents or glucocorticoids, dose of glucocorticoid, and comorbidities based on the Charlson comorbidity index. Immunosuppressive agents included cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and hydroxychloroquine.All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. ReferencesStoll, T., Sutcliffe, N., Mach, J., Klaghofer, R. & Isenberg, D. A.

Keywords 21 February 2021 | 16:00 PM America/Denver Amid the Coronavirus Pandemic, RSV and Pediatric Flu Cases in Utah Plummet to Unprecedented Levels Normally at this time of year, Intermountain Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City is filled with ill infants and toddlers who are being treated for respiratory complications due to RSV and flu. Some of these young patients require ICU care and assistance from mechanical ventilators to breathe. This year, Primary Children's Hospital has had no pediatric RSV or flu patients admitted to the hospital, which is unheard of. Influenza infections, which can be severe in young children, are also extremely rare this year. The safety measures that people are taking during the COVID-19 pandemic can explain some, but not all, of the anomaly, said Dr. Andrew Pavia, chief of pediatric infectious disease at University of Utah Health and director of epidemiology at Intermountain Primary Children's Hospital. "Masking, handwashing and physical distancing clearly played a major role, but it is hard to understand why RSV just did not show up at all this year," Dr. Pavia said. "It's a silver lining of the pandemic, but also bit of a mystery." RSV is a seasonal respiratory illness that causes infection in the lungs and breathing passages. It is often more serious for babies and young children, especially if it causes bronchiolitis or another complication, said Dr. Per Gesteland, a pediatric hospitalist at University of Utah Health and Intermountain Primary Children's Hospital. "In Utah, RSV is most active in the winter and early spring, and epidemics are reported every year between January and March," said Dr. Gesteland, who oversees GermWatch, a tool created by Intermountain Healthcare and University of Utah Health to help the public understand Utah communicable disease trends, symptoms and general information about treatment. "We've never had a year with so few cases of RSV or influenza in Utah," Dr. Gesteland added. Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that each year, RSV results in about 2.1 million outpatient visits and 58,000 hospitalizations for kids younger than 5 years old. The RSV season varies by geography, but generally begins in fall and ends in spring, with peak RSV season between December and February in temperate climates. But this year, national RSV cases also are extremely low. Last year at this time, about 2,300 positive PCR tests for RSV were reported through a network of labs CDC uses to look at RSV epidemiology, since unlike many diseases, not all cases of RSV are tracked. This year in mid-February, there were 11. In Utah, it is not unusual to diagnose well over 100 cases of RSV and influenza per week for several weeks each winter. Some winters are even more severe. Typically, about 80 children are admitted to Primary Children's Hospital each week during the January and February peak of respiratory viral season, with up to one-third of those patients requiring ICU care, Dr. Gesteland said. In the 2018-2019 flu season, about 300 children were hospitalized due to complications with flu, Dr. Gesteland said. Primary Children's caregivers had been concerned that a winter RSV and flu surge on top of COVID-19 cases could stretch hospital resources to the brink. Instead, there have been enough resources to treat children with COVID-19 and its related serious complication, Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). RSV is not as transmissible as COVID-19, so measures like masking and reducing social interactions for infants are probably even more effective for RSV. Perhaps the COVID-19 dominance of the viral ecosystem has an additional impact on displacing RSV in ways we do not fully understand, Dr. Pavia said. The months after the pandemic subsides, however, are a mystery. Will RSV and flu come back stronger than usual? Or less strong? "Generally, having a large cohort of infants and young children with no immunity to RSV would signal that when it returns, it will do so with a vengeance, but we are in uncharted territory," Dr. Pavia said. Influenza is even harder to predict, and influenza experts don't like to predict year-to-year variation, Dr. Pavia said. "One thing seems to be clear from the experience of the winter of 2020-21: We can decrease the impact of influenza on infants and children with better handwashing, mask use, and limiting the amount of their exposure to others," Dr. Pavia said. "Whether and how we will change our winter behavior enough in the future to reduce the impact of RSV and flu in the future is yet another mystery." # # # Intermountain Health Media Relations Intermountain Health welcomes the opportunity to work with local, national, and international journalists and news media outlets.

Read our privacy policyNot a single case of influenza has been detected by public health officials in England for the past seven weeks, with infection rates at historic lows amid the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions.The social restrictions brought in to curb transmission of coronavirus, combined with increased uptake of the flu vaccine, have both been credited with driving down infections.Thousands of swab samples are processed and analysed by scientists at Public Health England (PHE) every week to survey the prevalence of different respiratory diseases in the population.But of the 685,243 samples that have been reviewed at PHE’s laboratories since the first week of January, not a single one has tested positive for influenza.In the week up to 31 December 2020, just one case of flu was confirmed by laboratory analysis.Read more: Latest coronavirus news live todayDr Vanessa Saliba, head of flu at PHE, told The Independent: “The decrease in flu cases this year is likely due to changes in our behaviour, such as social distancing, face coverings and handwashing, as well as the reduction in international travel.“In England, more than 15 million people receive the flu jab every year, which helps protect them from flu and also stops them spreading it to others. “This season’s immunisation programme is on track to be the most successful ever, with the highest levels of vaccine uptake recorded for those 65 years and over, 2- and 3-year-olds and healthcare workers.”RecommendedOne in 10 Covid patients die within months of leaving hospital, study revealsPHE runs nationwide surveillance of influenza all year round, and produces a weekly report on the virus and other respiratory illnesses between October and April to capture activity during peak flu season.Separate data gathered by the Royal College of General Practitioners’(RCGP) research and surveillance centre has shown that the rate of influenza-like symptoms stood at 0.5-1.3 per 100,000 persons for December – well below the five-year average for this time of year.With widespread social distancing and mask-wearing measures in place throughout the UK, the usual routes of transmission for influenza have been blocked.The virus has a natural R rate of 1.3-1.5, depending on the strain. In comparison, the basic R value for Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19 – is estimated to be around 2.5-3.0.This means influenza is far less infectious and easily spread than coronavirus, helping to further explain its low prevalence in the UK population.Such trends have raised the need to reconsider the country’s approach to dealing with influenza, according to Christina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London.“There’s been no flu season anywhere in the world this year, including the UK,” she told The Independent. “Flu is one of the big reasons that the NHS struggles every winter. But what I think is really interesting is that people say we live with flu deaths every year and kind of assumed they were unavoidable. Yet clearly they’re not. “If we wanted to, we’ve shown we can reduce flu deaths to pretty much zero. I don’t think that the damage we have done through lockdown is anything that anyone would support to prevent flu, but it does bring into question the idea of whether there is anything that we can do.”She said that hand sanitiser should be kept available in all shops and transport hubs for the years to come, and argued that it is “worth encouraging people to wear masks” on public transport and in other busy environments during the winter months.“I don’t know if it’s the social distancing or the mask wearing that’s done it [in reducing flu rates], but I think we should at least be having those conversations,” Prof Pagel added.“Another thing, especially in Britain, is this attitude that if you’re sick, you still go in to work. We need to change that. We’ve shown that a lot of people can work remotely.“I think it’s an unintended consequence of Covid that we’ve realised flu isn’t this unavoidable threat that we thought it was.”Influenza vaccination rates have meanwhile reached new heights throughout the course of the Covid-19 pandemic.According to the latest PHE data, 80.8 per cent of people aged over 65 in England have received the latest flu jab.Prof Pagel said the health inequalities highlighted by Covid-19 are also applicable to flu, and that a joint approach to improving the quality of care in England’s most deprived communities would help to reduce widespread infections for both diseases.“The other thing Covid has highlighted is how big the impact of inequality is on health,” she said. “We’ve seen it with Covid in BAME and deprived communities. They have much more exposure to Covid and get sicker when they get it. Flu has a very similar gradient. The more deprived you are, the more likely you’ll get sick from flu.”Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said it was unclear whether flu cases would surge later this year after being subdued over the recent winter months.“Hopefully some of the good habits in relation to social distancing and hygiene might help again in the future as well,” he told The Independent.Prof Griffin warned there could be an issue in terms of surveillance and vaccine development. “If there’s very little [flu] circulating it’s harder to predict which strains might be dominant and so need to be incorporated into the vaccine,” he added.More aboutPublic Health EnglandCoronavirusEnglandflu vaccineInfluenzaCOVID-19Join our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/0Not a single case of flu detected by Public Health England in 2021✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Ⓒ 2024 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved NEWS Health News First Cases of H5N8 Bird Flu Are Asymptomatic—Experts Say That's Promising By Korin Miller Updated on February 26, 2021 Fact checked by James Lacy Print Peter Garrard Beck / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways A strain of avian flu, previously detected in Europe and Asia, has jumped from animals to humans in Russia.This is the first time H5N8 has been detected in people—those infected didn’t experience symptoms of the virus.Experts say their asymptomatic nature is a good sign this avian flu won't cause severe disease. Health officials in Russia are reporting the first known cases of a particular strain of avian flu that has passed from poultry to people. The strain, known as avian influenza H5N8, infected workers who were exposed to bird flocks, a World Health Organization (WHO) Europe spokesperson told CNN. The workers did not develop symptoms and there was no evidence reported that they passed the virus on to other people. Avian Flu Avian flu, commonly referred to as bird flu, is a disease caused by an infection with avian influenza Type A viruses. The viruses occur naturally in wild aquatic birds around the world, but they can infect domestic poultry and other animals. Anna Popova, the head of Russia's Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing, said in a press conference that H5N8 had been detected in seven poultry farm workers in the southern part of the country. Popova also said the workers felt fine, adding, “this situation did not develop further.” Respiratory Infections While outbreaks of the H5N8 strain have been detected in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East, and North Africa in the past few months, this is the first time the strain was reported in humans. Pedro Piedra, MD, a professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, tells Verywell it’s promising that the infected workers were asymptomatic. “We have very little data, but the data that is out there suggests this will not cause severe disease,” he says. What This Means For You While news of a virus jumping from animals to humans is concerning, especially during a global pandemic, experts say there’s no reason to worry about H5N8 at this point. How Avian Flu Spreads The World Health Organization is investigating the cases of H5N8 in Russia, a spokesperson told Reuters, noting, “we are in discussion with national authorities to gather more information and assess the public health impact of this event.”﻿﻿ Siberia’s Vector Institute is also reportedly starting to develop human tests for H5N8 and will create a vaccine against the avian flu strain. 12 Tips on How to Prevent Infectious Diseases Avian flu viruses typically don’t infect humans, but sporadic infections have happened. Infected birds shed the avian influenza virus in their saliva, mucus, and feces, and people usually can get infected when enough of the virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled through droplets in the air. Some strains of avian flu, like H7N9 and H5N1, are more likely to cause severe illness and even death. The virus can be detected through laboratory tests, and treatment involves the use of antiviral medications, including oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir. Monitoring Emerging Diseases The current outbreak of H5N8 is “rather concerning” for poultry because it’s lethal, Jürgen A. Richt, DVM, PhD, a professor at Kansas State University and director of the Center on Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, tells Verywell. But, he says, “we don’t know yet the real risk and impact of transmission to humans and its effect on human health.” In general, zoonotic disease—meaning diseases that jump from animals to humans—is generally considered rare. “However, in the last four decades we have seen an increase in new emerging disease events,” Amira Roess, PhD, MPH, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University in Virginia, tells Verywell. “It is unclear how much of this is due to our ability to detect emerging pathogens now with advances in technology, or if it is because of a true increase in exposures due to our increasing encroachment on wildlife or a combination of the two.” It’s worth noting, Richt says, that about 70% of the new emerging diseases in the past few decades—including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19—started in animals. Ebola, H1N1, and HIV are also zoonotic diseases, he points out. That’s why surveillance is so important, Piedra says. “We need to be able to monitor and respond at a global level to be able to identify these pathogens, and to be able to act quickly with appropriate infection control measures,” he says. “This has to be happen at a global level in order to be able to contain future outbreaks.” In general, Roess says the relationship between humans and animals “needs to be revisited” to prevent future outbreaks, and keep wildlife as a healthy part of the ecosystem. 4 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

They aim to register a control group of approximately 50,000 unvaccinated participants to determine how often events similar to the adverse reactions reported amongst vaccinated people occur in the unvaccinated group. Study participants will be asked to complete online surveys eight days after they receive the first COVID-19 vaccine, another eight days after the second dose–if they receive one–and then a final survey six months after that. Non-vaccinated participants will need to complete up to three surveys. These surveys will estimate how much illness is expected in the community. Once those in the non-vaccinated group receive the vaccine they may fill out the vaccine surveys. The CANVAS Network conducts active safety surveillance for pandemic vaccines (e.g. H1N1 influenza vaccine in 2009), seasonal influenza vaccines (2010-2020) and other new vaccines (e.g. meningococcal B vaccine in Quebec in 2014) to inform public health authorities about their safety.

Here, a 3-D model of lung small airway cells is stained with different colored markers that show certain cell types. The yellow represents the receptor protein involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. (Yen-Ting Tung, Ph.D., and Olive Jung)Although several vaccines are currently available to protect against infection from the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the development of drug treatments remains a critical medical need and challenge. One reason is the assays, or tests, that are used to find drugs with antiviral activity often are not measuring how a drug behaves in the human body, including its ability to halt the virus from infecting cells and how variant mutations affect this ability and disease severity.To help solve this challenge, NCATS scientists are developing a cadre of new 3-D tissue models to examine how respiratory viruses like the SARS-CoV-2 virus and influenza viruses can infect the lungs and other tissues and cause disease. They plan to use these models to predict the effects of compounds and drugs against these and related viruses to speed potential treatments to the clinic.“Our ultimate goal is to have a platform of relevant tissue models on hand to evaluate potential drugs and therapies when the next respiratory virus arrives on the scene,” said Emily Lee, Ph.D., a virologist in the NCATS 3-D Tissue Bioprinting Laboratory (3DTBL).Led by Marc Ferrer, Ph.D., 3DTBL scientists use 3-D tissue engineering techniques to create these laboratory-grown human tissue models that mimic natural tissues in human organs. The tissues live on multiwell plates, where viruses can be added to study how the cells in these tissues are infected and to test the effects of drugs or compounds in halting viral infection. NCATS scientists and others are designing assays to use in experiments, including those in which viruses and their variants can be seen infecting cells as they do in the human body. The experiments will help them determine which drugs and compounds among large collections should be tested in more expensive and time-consuming animal studies.They also expect that these tissue models will quickly help shed light on whether new mutant variants of the viruses are able to infect cells and whether treatments remain effective.“3-D tissue models of infected cells can be a bridge to use for rapid, high-throughput screening of thousands of compounds and drugs at once to evaluate potential therapies,” said Lee. “Pandemics are going to keep happening, most likely with respiratory viruses. We want to build a platform where we can plug in any respiratory virus.” 3-D tissue models of infected cells can be a bridge to use for rapid, high-throughput screening of thousands of compounds and drugs at once to evaluate potential therapies. Pandemics are going to keep happening, most likely with respiratory viruses. We want to build a platform where we can plug in any respiratory virus.Complexity mattersExisting lung tissue models have limited uses in drug testing, Ferrer noted. The NCATS team is using tissue engineering techniques to build different 3-D lung tissue models — some more biologically complex than others — that are made up of various kinds of cells involved in viral infection. The researchers think this strategy will help them study and characterize various aspects of the viral infection process.For now, the NCATS scientists do not actually work with live SARS-CoV-2 in their laboratories because NCATS lacks the appropriate biosafety laboratory for such experiments. They are, however, studying live SARS-CoV-2 infection in their collaborators’ facilities.With the help of an intramural award from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ Intramural Targeted Anti-COVID-19 (ITAC) program, the team is using a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to determine how and when a viral infection turns which genes on and off in different cell types. They are using these models and single-cell RNA sequencing to study a variety of respiratory viruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2, including various strains of flu and coronaviruses, to better understand the biology of the viral infections in human organs. These studies can provide insights into genetic changes brought on by infections of the different virus variants.“We’re developing models of greater physiological complexity to see the effects of the virus infection on different cell types, such as those that make blood vessels,” said Ferrer.His team is creating lung tissues with blood vessels to investigate whether and how SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses play a role in the formation of blood clots, which has been seen in some patients with COVID-19. The team also is working to develop models to examine how the body’s immune system reacts to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In some COVID-19 patients, the immune system unleashes excessive amounts of proteins that trigger inflammation — called a “cytokine storm” — and can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and other life-threatening complications.“The benefit of our approach is that we can recapitulate not only the infection, but also the disease aspect,” Lee said. “When we’re testing the effects of drugs on a virus infection in our models, we can screen for broad antiviral effects but also for drugs that can be used against the specific disease.”These studies may allow the team to observe how a viral infection affects patients with different underlying conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension. As NCATS scientists continue to create innovative, preclinical 3-D cellular models to study the details of viral infections and test promising drugs, one of their goals is to accelerate the development of more individualized therapies as well.

In November, for example, our mayor cheerfully hosted a national rodeo competition, bringing in thousands of tourists during a period when we had fewer than twenty available ICU beds countywide. As 2021 begins with appropriate celebration over the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine, I fear that the stories we tell about the pandemic will become stories of scientific triumph, punctuated by personal grief. These are important narratives, but they can short-circuit accountability for our real failures of structure and leadership, accountability we need to prepare for the next crisis. This anxiety led me back to the work of one of my favorite writers, fellow Texan Katherine Anne Porter, whose 1939 novella Pale Horse, Pale Rider is one of very few literary representations of the 1918 pandemic.[1] Based in part on the author’s own experience contracting flu in Denver, Colorado while working for the Rocky Mountain News, it follows Miranda, a reporter for the “Blue Mountain News,” over the course of one day in which she resists and eventually succumbs to flu symptoms, cared for by her soldier boyfriend Adam. Ultimately, Miranda, like Porter, recovers after an injection of strychnine. However, when she awakes, she learns that Adam has not survived his own bout of flu. First edition cover of Pale Horse, Pale Rider. (Wikimedia Commons Pale Horse, Pale Rider reads as a deeply personal story, not just because of its autobiographical origins, but also because it follows Miranda’s point of view even as she becomes delirious with fever. Vivid imagery and Biblical symbolism dominate the last section of the novel, as Porter uses modernist literary techniques like stream of consciousness to explore Miranda’s internal experience of flu. Rereading this text during our current pandemic, though, I realized that as a reader, I’ve overlooked Porter’s depiction of the external, of her community’s response to the threat of pandemic illness as Miranda goes about a seemingly normal day while her symptoms worsen. I turned to archives of local journalism (thanks to the University of Michigan’s Influenza Encyclopedia), Porter’s own milieu, to test the theory that Pale Horse, Pale Rider should be read not only for its depiction of an individual’s struggle with illness, but also for its lessons about a city struggling to respond to a crisis in a culture hampered by the pressures of nationalism and capitalism – lessons all too applicable in our current moment. In November 1918, the Denver city government published in its monthly newsletter, Municipal Facts, an evaluation of its citizens’ response to the deadly autumn: For some reason . . . even the most enlightened citizens will not take the influenza epidemic seriously. . . . They know that the disease is a deadly menace and snuffs out life almost before the victim realizes that he is ill. Yet when health officers try to impress upon the public the necessity of following essential rules and regulations, the average citizen simply refuses to heed these admonitions. This harsh take fits the Influenza Encyclopedia’s narrative of Denver’s response. Although the city’s churches and businesses supported a closing order on October 6, citizens quickly employed loopholes, such as congregating outdoors. Business owners also lobbied for a quick reopening, even as cases continued to climb. When a second wave rose after Armistice Day celebrations in November, most Denverites refused to follow mask orders, and the mayor essentially threw up his hands and gave up on enforcement.[2] View of the Rocky Mountain News building, at 1555-59 Larimer Street, in Denver, Colorado, a brick office with arched windows and signs: “News Block,” “Rocky Mountain News,” “United States Express Co.,” and “Overland Daily Mail Express & Stable Line. (Denver Public Library Special Collections) The real-life Rocky Mountain News flu coverage in late September and early October foreshadowed the city’s difficulty facing the pandemic’s realities. The paper covered influenza extensively as a national concern and one affecting military camps near Boulder. However, headlines advertise a lack of cases in Denver. A September 29 headline stated, “No Influenza in City, Health Manager Says”; an October 1 article title repeated, “No Influenza in City, Asserts Dr. Sharpley” [Denver’s Manager of Health]; on October 3, the public was again told “No Cases Reported So Far in Denver.” This all despite the fact that a confirmed flu death did occur in late September in Denver, as the September 29 story confirmed: “The funeral of Miss Blanche Kennedy, who died Friday morning . . . of Spanish influenza will take place this afternoon.” Blanche Kennedy’s death didn’t count, though, as “the disease in this case was contracted in Chicago.” The Denver of Pale Horse, Pale Rider is similarly blasé about the approaching disaster. Men are “dying like flies” in the army encampments near Denver, according to Adam, but theaters and restaurants are open. Miranda tells Adam of the “funny new sickness,” “it seems to be a plague,”[3] as their stroll together is interrupted by funeral processions, but she downplays her own symptoms. The only extended conversation about influenza occurs among her newspaper colleagues, who joke about conspiracy theories claiming influenza is a German biological weapon.[4] In reviewing U.S. news coverage of influenza in September 1918, Tom Dicke has applied the term “cognitive inertia,” suggesting that Americans did not take flu preparation seriously because they couldn’t overcome the assumption that the flu was a mild disease affecting only vulnerable populations.[5] Denver papers’ coverage of the flu, as well as Porter’s novella, seem to confirm his theory. These same sources also show, though, that cognitive inertia isn’t just a personal psychological barrier, but an effect produced by culture. In the case of Denver in 1918, the city’s and the nation’s immersion in World War I created a delayed response to the flu, based in people’s resistance to adjusting the nationalist priorities of wartime. Porter hinted that Miranda literally sacrifices her health for the war effort, as she performed volunteer hospitality work with convalescing soldiers the day before her symptoms started. The continuation of women’s inessential volunteer war work as the flu outbreak emerged seems to be drawn from life: the Rocky Mountain News ran a notice banning “workers who have colds” from volunteering at the Red Cross on October 6, the same day the city issued the order closing businesses and schools, suggesting that women’s war work continued up to the last possible second. Nationalist fervor is also represented as a danger to human life in Porter’s representation of local theater. Miranda and Adam attend a “long, dreary play” she’s reviewing; at intermission, they’re subjected to a speech urging the audience to buy Liberty Bonds. Porter ends the scene with a grim image: “The audience rose and sang . . . their open mouths black and faces pallid in the reflected footlights; some of the faces grimaced and wept and had shining streaks like snail’s tracks on them.”[6] We can read this description as just another of the many images of death in the novella. However, the “pallid” audience not only evokes death through their appearance, but also cause each other’s deaths, spreading the virus through their loud performance of patriotism. The theater in Pale Horse, Pale Rider is a venue for performative patriotism, but it’s also a place of commerce, as Porter reminds us by having Miranda attend not for pleasure, but as a tedious requirement of her job. My survey of Denver newspapers suggests that one of the most publicized debates about the city’s business closures revolved around theaters. As early as October 12, the Rocky Mountain News ran a story titled “Theaters’ Loss Heavy,” claiming Denver theaters were losing $15,000 a week. On November 23, after the reemergence of the flu following Armistice Day celebrations, the same paper reported “managers of all the Denver theaters and moving pictures asked The News to put them on record as voicing a strong protest” against closure orders. The theater managers were arguing that since department stores were allowed to open, the continued closure of theaters unfairly targeted their businesses. In this context, Porter’s representation of the theater as a place of death reads as a reminder of the human cost of such disputes and their ensnarement in capitalist assumptions about economic “freedom.” Like Pale Horse, Pale Rider, narratives arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic are already being described as “deeply personal.” However, like that of the 1918 pandemic, the story of COVID-19’s devastation is as much about social fissures as individual suffering. When we read and tell stories about these crises, we must be vigilant for the ways in which the personal can erase the political, and work to keep our governments’ and communities’ shortcomings in the foreground. If we do, our communities may be better prepared for the next (pandemic) rodeo. Notes Literary historians explain the flu’s absence from the literary record by suggesting that it was “a less compelling story” than World War I (Catherine Hovanec, “Of Bodies, Families, and Communities,” Literature and Medicine 29, no. 1 (2011): 161) or, conversely, that its trauma was more cataclysmic to survivors than that of the war, rendering it indescribable (Catherine Belling, “Overwhelming the Medium,” Literature and Medicine 28, no. 1 (2010): 57). Elizabeth Outka’s 2019 monograph Viral Modernisms (Columbia University Press) explores the question in detail, suggesting that the pandemic can be read in the form and themes of literature of the 1920s and 30s, despite being rarely explicitly represented. ↑ Alfred W.

Previous studies reported that low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI)-derived candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) are poorly immunogenic. Here, we assess the immunogenicity and efficacy of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (GD/16)-extracted hemagglutinin (eHA) vaccine. GD/16 eHA induces robust H7-specific antibody responses in mice with a marked adjuvant antigen-sparing effect. Mice immunized with adjuvanted GD/16 eHA are protected from the lethal LPAI and HPAI H7N9 challenges, in stark contrast to low antibody titers and high mortality in mice receiving adjuvanted LPAI H7 eHAs. The protection correlates well with the magnitude of the H7-specific antibody response (IgG and microneutralization) or HA group 2 stem-specific IgG. Inclusion of adjuvanted GD/16 eHA in heterologous prime-boost improves the immunogenicity and protection of LPAI H7 HAs in mice. Our findings support the inclusion of GD/16-derived CVV in the pandemic preparedness vaccine stockpile.

Most H7N9 infections occurred in older individuals (>60 years old) with underlying comorbidities who had close contact with infected poultry2. Patients primarily developed lower respiratory infections with severity ranging from viral pneumonia to respiratory failure3,4. Critically, the overall H7N9-related fatality rate is approximately 40%5, which is significantly higher than those caused by seasonal influenza or 2009 H1N1 pandemic6. Most H7N9 clinical isolates, e.g. A/Anhui/1/2013 (AH/1) and A/Shanghai/2/2013 (SH/2) from the first wave, or A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (HK/125) from the fifth wave, are low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, and contain only a monobasic cleavage site in hemagglutinin (HA)7. A highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subclade bearing a multibasic HA cleavage site emerged during the fifth wave after viruses evolved into several phylogenetically divergent HA groups7,8. These HPAI H7N9 viruses cause systemic infections with expanded tissue tropism and show enhanced virulence in humans, poultry, and experimental animals8,9,10,11. From October 2016 to September 2017, LPAI and HPAI H7N9 viruses co-circulated in Asia, resulting in 766 confirmed human infections with 288 deaths, making the fifth wave the most deadly A(H7N9) epidemic to date12.In general, H7N9 viruses are inefficient in droplet transmission, though readily spread by contact transmission in cohoused ferrets11. However, a recent study reports that HPAI A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (GD/16) H7N9 virus isolated during the fifth wave infected ferrets via respiratory droplets without adaptation13, which supports the potential of HPAI H7N9 viruses for sustained human-to-human respiratory transmission. This poses a significant threat to public health, highlighting the urgency of developing effective H7N9 vaccines.The development of H7N9 vaccines has mainly focused on LPAI virus-derived candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). However, HPAI and LPAI viruses are antigenically distinct; ferret antisera raised by infection of LPAI virus-derived CVVs reacted poorly against HPAI viruses12. Thus, vaccines that can provide broad cross-protection against both LPAI and HPAI H7N9 viruses are highly desired. In this study, we compared the immunogenicity and cross-protection in mice immunized with HA derived from HPAI GD/16 of the fifth wave vs HA derived from LPAI H7N9 viruses. Our results indicate that GD/16-derived HA is more immunogenic than LPAI H7N9-derived HA and protects immunized mice against lethal challenges of LPAI and HPAI H7N9 viruses.ResultsImmunization of adjuvanted GD/16-extracted HA induces cross-reactive antibodies against LPAI H7N9 challengesHAs extracted (eHAs) from formalin-inactivated H7N9 CVVs (Supplemental Fig. 1a, b) were further purified to minimize contamination with other viral proteins (Supplemental Fig. 1c). eHAs were then used to immunize mice with or without AddaVax™—a squalene-based adjuvant, similar to MF59 adjuvant included in FLUAD® influenza vaccine. Compared to SH/2 eHA, immunization of mice with GD/16 eHA with or without adjuvant generally induced higher geometric mean titers (GMTs) of IgG against SH/2 HA by ELISA and microneutralization (MN) antibodies against LPAI wild type (wt) AH/1 virus (a SH/2-like strain) (Fig. 1a, b). Administration of 500 ng/mouse of adjuvanted GD/16 eHA induced the highest SH/2 cross-reactive IgG ELISA and MN GMTs among all doses tested (Fig. 1a, b). Mice receiving 50 ng adjuvanted GD/16 eHA also developed higher SH/2-specific IgG ELISA titers than those immunized with 500 ng of SH/2 eHA alone (p < 0.05) or with adjuvant (Fig. 1a). These data suggest that GD/16 eHA is more immunogenic than SH/2 eHA and induces a cross-reactive antibody response to SH/2. Following a lethal LPAI challenge with wt AH/1 (a SH/2-like virus), mice immunized with 500 ng unadjuvanted SH/2 or GD/16 eHA showed up to a 30% body weight (BW) loss and also 80% and 40% mortality, respectively (Fig. 1c, d). In contrast, immunization with 500 ng adjuvanted SH/2 or GD/16 eHA protected all mice against the lethal AH/1 challenge, and mice receiving adjuvanted GD/16 eHA showed less morbidity and recovered faster (Fig. 1c, d).Fig. 1: Immunogenicity and protection against low pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 virus of the first wave.BALB/c mice were immunized twice with HA extracted (eHA) from H7N9 candidate vaccine viruses A/Shanghai/2/2013 (SH/2) or A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (GD/16) with or without adjuvant.

Mice receiving 50 ng adjuvanted GD/16 and HK/125 eHAs showed significantly higher HK/125-specific IgG ELISA titers than the groups given 500 ng unadjuvanted eHAs, indicating an antigen-sparing effect by adjuvant (Fig. 2a). Consistent with the antibody responses, mice immunized with 500 ng GD/16 or HK/125 eHA with or without adjuvant showed similar morbidity and had 80–100% survival after a lethal LPAI wt HK/125 challenge (Fig. 2c, d).Fig. 2: Immunogenicity and protection against Low pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 virus of the fifth wave.BALB/c mice were immunized twice with HA extracted (eHA) from H7N9 candidate vaccine viruses A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (HK/125) or A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (GD/16) with or without adjuvant. Immunized mice were challenged with low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) wild type (wt) H7N9 HK/125 virus in a BSL-3+ biocontainment.

The homologous prime-boost with 500 ng adjuvanted GD/16 eHA induced the highest GD/16-specific IgG ELISA and MN antibody titers in mice as compared to the other preparations tested (Fig. 3a, b). Mice immunized with GD/16 eHA, regardless of dose or adjuvant, had higher GD/16-specific IgG ELISA and MN GMTs than those immunized with SH/2 or HK/125 eHA at the same dose (Fig. 3a, b). Adjuvanted GD/16 or HK/125 eHA at 50 ng/dose showed an antigen-sparing effect by inducing higher GD/16-specific IgG GMTs than those elicited by unadjuvanted SH/2 eHA at 500 ng/dose (p < 0.01, Fig. 3a). Additionally, immunization with unadjuvanted or adjuvanted H7 eHAs induced HA group 2 stem-specific antibodies as measured by ELISA using a chimeric H6/H3 HA, with the highest titers observed in mice given 500 ng adjuvanted GD/16 eHA (Fig. 3c).Fig. 3: Immunogenicity and protection against highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 virus of the fifth wave.BALB/c mice were immunized with HA extracted (eHA) from H7N9 candidate vaccine viruses A/Shanghai/2/2013 (SH/2), A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (HK/125), or A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (GD/16) with or without adjuvant. Immunized mice were challenged with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) wild type (wt) GD/16 virus at 5 × 107 TCID50/50 µl/mouse (high dose) in a BSL-3+ biocontainment.

Individual titers with geometric mean (bars) are shown (n = 5-15 mice/group). BW data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m (n = 5–10 mice/group). Correlation of antibody titers with mouse survival/mortality statuses after challenge was analyzed using logistic fit with χ2. Individual p values and R2 values are shown. Red dots indicate mortality (M) and blue asterisks indicate survival (S). *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 by Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons after log transformation (antibody responses) or by Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test (survival curves).Full size imageFollowing a high lethal dose HPAI challenge with wt GD/16 (5 × 107 TCID50 /mouse), all immunization groups showed significant morbidity within the 1st week of infection. All mice from HK/125 or SH/2 eHA groups succumbed to death by 10 days post-infection (Fig. 3d). In contrast, 80% of mice immunized with adjuvanted 500 ng GD/16 eHA survived the highly lethal HAPI challenge and rapidly recovered weight (Fig. 3d, e). The group receiving 500 ng unadjuvanted GD/16 eHA had only 20% of mice survive the highly lethal HAPI challenge with slower recovery (Fig. 3d, e). We performed the regression analysis to correlate the survival/mortality statuses of individual mice in Fig. 3e, with their corresponding GD/16 and stem-specific IgG ELISA and MN titers by computationally fitting with χ2. The survival of individual mice after the highly lethal HPAI wt GD/16 challenge positively correlated with their GD/16 HA-specific IgG ELISA titers (p < 0.0001), higher HA-specific IgG titers and greater survival probability (Fig. 3f). Similarly, GD/16-specific MN titers positively correlated with surviving the highly lethal HPAI wt GD/16 infection (p < 0.0124, Fig. 3g). Moreover, HA group 2 stem-specific IgG ELISA titers showed a strong positive correlation with surviving the highly lethal HPAI wt GD/16 challenge (p < 0.0001, Fig. 3h). Mice with GD/16-specific IgG titer of 4.1 (Log10), MN titer of 2.8 (Log10), or stem-specific IgG titer of 4.2 (Log10) were predicted to have 50% chance surviving the highly lethal HPAI wt GD/16 challenge (Fig. 3f–h).In a passive antibody transfer experiment using GD/16 CVV as the challenge virus, all naïve mice receiving hyperimmune sera from adjuvanted GD/16 eHA-immunized mice survived lethal challenge despite initial BW loss (Fig. 4a, b). By contrast, naïve mice receiving adjuvanted SH/2 eHA-elicited hyperimmune sera or adjuvant-induced sera exhibited 60% or 100% mortality after both groups showed quick BW drop following the lethal challenge (Fig. 4a, b). These results, together with the LPAI challenge data show that first, antibodies induced by GD/16 eHA broadly protect against antigenically divergent H7N9 viruses and second, protection against HPAI H7N9 virus is based on its ability to elicit a more robust antibody response.Fig. 4: Passive transfer of hyperimmune sera against lethal H7N9 challenge.Hyperimmune sera were collected from mice immunized with HA extracted (eHA) from H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013 (SH/2) or A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (GD/16) at 500 ng/mouse with adjuvant. Pooled hyperimmune sera were injected intravenously into naïve mice followed by a lethal challenge of GD/16 IDCDC-56N virus. (a) Body weight (BW) and (b) survival after GD/16 IDCDC-56N challenge. BW data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m (n = 5 mice/group). *p < 0.05 by Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test (survival curves).Full size imageHeterologous prime-boost immunization protects mice against lethal HPAI H7N9 challengesBecause LPAI H7 eHAs (especially SH/2 eHA) are poorly immunogenic, we investigated whether heterologous prime-boost immunization regimen with GD/16 eHA enhances immunogenicity and protection against HPAI H7N9 viruses. As shown in Fig. 5a–c, mice receiving the heterologous prime-boost of adjuvanted HK/125 and GD/16 eHAs or adjuvanted SH/2 and GD/16 eHAs (all at 500 ng/dose unless otherwise specified) had GMTs (Log10) for GD/16 HA-specific IgG (3.6 or 3.3), GD/16-specific MN (2.8 or 2.5), or HA stem-specific IgG (3.7 and 3.6), respectively, higher than those induced by the homologous prime-boost of adjuvanted SH/2 eHA or unadjuvanted GD/16 eHA at the same dose. Homologous prime-boost with adjuvanted GD/16 eHA yielded the highest GMTs (Log10) of GD/16-specific IgG (4.6), MN (2.8,), and HA stem-specific IgG (4.5), respectively (Fig. 5a–c). Following a lower lethal challenge dose of HPAI wt GD/16 (5 × 104 TCID50/mouse), mice with the homologous prime-boost of adjuvanted GD/16 eHA showed no morbidity and were fully protected (Fig. 5d, e). Mice receiving the heterologous prime-boost of adjuvanted eHAs (HK/125 and GD/16 or SH/2 and GD/16) also showed 100% survival without showing significant BW loss following the low lethal HPAI challenge (Fig. 5d, e). By contrast, all mice receiving the heterologous prime-boost of unadjuvanted eHAs or adjuvant succumbed to death with significant BW loss within 10 days of infection (Fig. 5d, e). Mice primed and boosted with unadjuvanted GD/16 eHA also lost approximately 20% BW but quickly recovered with 60% survival following the low lethal HPAI challenge (Fig. 5d, e).Fig. 5: Immunogenicity and protection of heterologous prime-boost immunization against highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 challenge.BALB/c mice were primed with HA extracted (eHA) from H7N9 candidate vaccine viruses A/Shanghai/2/2013 (SH/2) or A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (HK/125) and boosted with A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (GD/16) with or without adjuvant. Immunized mice were challenged with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) wild type (wt) GD/16 virus at 5 × 104 TCID50/50 µl/mouse (low dose) in a BSL-3+ biocontainment. (a) IgG ELISA titers against GD/16 HA; (b) microneutralization (MN) titers against HPAI wt GD/16 virus; (c) HA group 2 stem-specific IgG ELISA titers; (d) Body Weight (BW) and (e) survival after HPAI wt GD/16 challenge. Individual titers with geometric mean (bars) are shown (n = 5–10 mice/group). *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 by Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons after log transformation (antibody responses) or by Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test (survival curves).Full size imageThese results show that inclusion of adjuvanted GD/16 eHA in heterologous prime-boost improves the immunogenicity and efficacy of LPAI H7 HAs against HPAI H7N9 virus in mice.Recombinant H7 HAs are immunogenic and protect mice against lethal HPAI H7N9 challengesPrevious studies reported that recombinant HA (rHA) expressed by the baculovirus/insect system shows good immunogenicity14,15,16. We next assessed the immunogenicity and protection of baculovirus-expressed H7 rHAs (Supplemental Fig. 2) in vivo. Similar to eHAs purified from H7 CVVs, two doses of adjuvanted rHAs at 500 ng/strain/mouse induced significantly higher antibody titers than those elicited by unadjuvanted rHAs at the same dose (Fig. 6a–c). Unlike SH/2 eHA, which was poorly immunogenic even with adjuvant, adjuvanted SH/2 rHA induced cross-reactive antibodies at similar levels to those elicited by adjuvanted GD/16 rHA (Fig. 6a–c). Similarly, administration of adjuvanted HK/125 rHA elicited comparable levels of cross-reactive antibodies in mice (Fig. 6a–c).Fig. 6: Immunogenicity and protection of recombinant HA against highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 challenge.BALB/c mice were immunized with recombinant HA (rHA) of H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013 (SH/2), A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (HK/125), or A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (GD/16) with or without adjuvant. Immunized mice were challenged with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) wild type (wt) GD/16 virus at 5 × 107 TCID50/50 µl/mouse (high dose) in a BSL-3+ biocontainment. (a) IgG ELISA titers against GD/16 HA; (b) microneutralization (MN) titers against HPAI wt GD/16 virus; (c) HA group 2 stem-specific Ig titers; (d) Body Weight (BW) and (e) survival after HPAI wt GD/16 challenge. Individual titers with geometric mean (bars) are shown (n = 5–16 mice/group). **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 by Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons after log transformation (antibody responses) or by Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test (survival curves).Full size imageDespite initial BW loss after a highly lethal challenge with HPAI wt GD/16 (5 × 107 TCID50 /mouse), 80% of mice immunized with adjuvanted GD/16, HK/125 or SH/2 rHAs survived and quickly recovered (Fig. 6d, e). In contrast, all mice from the groups of unadjuvanted rHAs died after significant morbidity (Fig. 6d, e). These results show that baculovirus-expressed H7 rHAs, especially SH/2 rHA, have improved immunogenicity and induce cross-protection against highly lethal HPAI H7N9 infection.Antibodies elicited by adjuvanted GD/16-derived HA target epitopes involved in H7N9 protectionTo understand why immunization of adjuvanted GD/16 eHA induced broader cross-protection than that by adjuvanted SH/2 eHA, we conducted in vitro proliferation and ELISPOTs to assess cellular immunity elicited. The results showed that splenocytes harvested from mice immunized with adjuvanted SH/2 or GD/16 eHA exhibited comparable in vitro proliferation and produced similar levels of IgG, IL-4 or IFN-γ secreting spots after restimulation (Supplemental Fig. 3), indicating no detectable difference in B and T cell immunity induced. We then investigated if the quality of antibodies elicited by adjuvanted GD/16 eHA was different from that by adjuvanted SH/2 eHA by conducting competitive ELISA using biotinylated H7-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Neutralizing mAbs 1E9, 5A6, and 7B5 target distinct epitopes located in the globular head of H7 HA (Fig. 7a, b)17,18. Antibodies elicited by adjuvanted GD/16 eHA exhibited higher competitive capacity against mAb 1E9 than those induced by adjuvanted SH/2 or HK/125 eHA for HA binding (Fig. 7c). Antibodies elicited by adjuvanted GD/16 eHA also had the highest competitive capacity against mAb 5A6 followed by antibodies induced by adjuvanted HK/125 eHA and antibodies induced by adjuvanted SH/2 eHA were the least competitive against mAb 5A6 for HA binding (Fig. 7d). Antibodies elicited by all three adjuvanted eHA were equally competitive with mAb 7B5 for HA binding (Fig. 7e). Interestingly, antibodies elicited by adjuvanted SH/2 rHA showed enhanced HA binding and were equally competitive to antibodies elicited by adjuvanted GD/16 or HK/125 rHA against all three biotinylated mAbs (Fig. 7f–h).Fig. 7: Competition of H7 HA-specific monoclonal antibodies with mouse hyperimmune sera.Hyperimmune sera were raised in mice administered with adjuvanted HA extracted (eHA) from H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013 (SH/2), A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (HK/125), or A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (GD/16) or H7 recombinant HAs (rHAs) at 500 ng/mouse. Hyperimmune sera were pooled and were used to compete with biotinylated H7-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1E9, 5A6 or 7B5, respectively. The % of residual biotinylated mAbs as compared to the wells that contained only biotinylated H7 mAbs were plotted by nonlinear regression. (a) Side view and (b) top view of epitopes targeted by mAbs 1E9 (magenta), 5A6 (blue) and 7B5 (red) using SH/2 HA trimer (PDB ID: 4LN6) as the template; (c–h) competition with 1E9, 5A6 and 7B5. Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m (n = 6–9 replicates/group).Full size imageThese results indicate that immunization of adjuvanted GD/16 eHA resulted in broader antibody profile than those elicited by adjuvanted SH/2 or HK/125 eHA. Remarkably, immunization of baculovirus-expressed rHA, regardless of strain, yielded similar antibody binding profile for H7 HA.DiscussionThe weak immunogenicity of H7N9 viruses has been noted since the first epidemic in 2013. Patients infected with SH/2-like H7N9 viruses had no H7-specific antibodies detected during the acute infection and had very low levels of H7-specific neutralizing antibodies (GMT40) appear in the convalescent phase9. The results from both pre-clinical and clinical studies show that unadjuvanted SH/2- or AH/1-based inactivated monovalent vaccines are poorly immunogenic, with a two-dose regimen required to achieve detectable antibody titers in immunized animals or human subjects19,20,21,22,23,24. Higher seroconversion and seroprotective rates were achieved after administration of two doses of adjuvanted vaccines containing higher contents of SH/2-like HA19,20,21,22,23,24. The immunogenicity studies of the fifth wave H7N9 viruses also showed that higher antibody responses were induced in animals immunized with two doses of adjuvanted inactivated whole viruses versus two doses of unadjuvanted or one dose of adjuvanted preparations25,26.In the present study, we show that eHA extracted from HPAI GD/16 was more immunogenic than those extracted from LPAI SH/2 and HK/125 and induced higher and broader antibody responses against H7N9 viruses. The highest antibody titers were elicited in mice immunized with two doses of adjuvanted GD/16 eHA at 500 ng/mouse. This dose was considerably lower than those of inactivated SH/2-like monovalent vaccines evaluated in pre-clinical and clinical trials (3.7–45 µg HA/dose) or inactivated HK/125 or GD/16 whole virus vaccines tested in animal models (1–15 µg HA/dose)19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26. While inactivated split/subunit vaccines or whole virus-based preparations also contain other viral components such as neuraminidase that may play a role in protection27,28, we only focused on H7 HAs in the present study. Inclusion of AddaVax—a squalene-based adjuvant further reduced the required amount of GD/16 eHA per dose to 50 ng/mouse while still eliciting higher antibody responses than those induced by unadjuvanted eHAs at 500 ng/mouse. Such antigen-sparing and immune-enhancing effects have also been observed in the H7N9 vaccine clinical trials involving squalene-based (MF59 and AS03) or saponin-based (ISCOMATRIX) adjuvants20,21,22,24,29 but not aluminum hydroxide23. Higher antibody titers were seen in human subjects receiving two 3.75 µg/dose of inactivated SH/2-like monovalent vaccines adjuvanted with MF59 or AS03 versus those administered with two 45 µg/dose of unadjuvanted vaccines22,24. The antigen-sparing and immune-enhancing effects by adjuvanted vaccines are highly desired for pandemic preparedness, since it means less antigens are needed to achieve protective immunity and more doses of vaccines will be available during a pandemic outbreak from a given production run.The present study also shows that mice primed and boosted with adjuvanted GD/16 eHA but not LPAI eHAs at 500 ng/mouse are protected from the lethal LPAI and HPAI H7N9 challenges. Protection appears to be mainly mediated by virus-specific antibodies, since passive transfer of GD/16-specific, but not SH/2-specific hyperimmune sera protected recipient mice from the lethal challenge of GD/16 CVV, consistent with a recent report that mice receiving hyperimmune sera raised by inactivated whole GD/16 CVV were protected from the challenges of GD/16 and AH/1 CVVs26. In the current study, we measured IgG ELISA and MN antibodies instead of HAI titers in mice following low doses of immunization, because H7N9 virus has high receptor binding avidity that greatly reduces HAI assay sensitivity26. MN assay detects not only antibodies blocking receptor binding but also HA stem, NA and M2 antibodies that mediate neutralization30. Thus, MN titer has been considered a more robust parameter than HAI titer for monitoring antibody responses to influenza viruses, especially those of avian origin21,26,30,31. Our study shows that mice with higher virus-specific MN titers were more likely to survive the lethal HPAI GD/16 challenge than those with lower MN titers. Higher virus-specific MN titers also correlated with lower viral burdens in the respiratory tract of ferrets immunized with adjuvanted SH/2-based monovalent vaccine followed by wild type AH/1 challenge31. In H7N9-infected patients, early induction of MN antibodies favors quick recovery from infection32.In addition to MN titers, we also observed that both HA head- and stem-specific IgGs strongly correlated with the survival probability of mice challenged with HPAI wt GD/16 virus. In ferrets, H7-specific IgG ELISA titers were found to inversely correlate with respiratory virus loads after a LPAI H7N9 challenge19. Both HA head- and stem-specific IgGs were also found more sensitive than HAI or MN titers as surrogate markers of efficacy after a low immunogenic H7N1 vaccine failed to induce robust neutralizing antibodies in humans33. IgGs captured by quantitative ELISAs include both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies targeting the HA global head as those measured by HAI assay can prevent virus entry by blocking HA and host receptor interaction, while HA stem-specific neutralizing antibodies can inhibit pH-dependent conformational changes and interfere with membrane fusion to impair virus replication34. However, with few exceptions, HA head-specific neutralizing antibodies have limited cross-reactivity because the HA global head is highly variable across different subtypes. In contrast, the stem region is more conserved across different HA groups and neutralizing antibodies target the HA stem have the potential to confer broad cross-protection against influenza viruses34,35. In a household transmission study, HA stem-specific antibodies were founded to independently correlate with protection in humans infected with pandemic H1N128. While neutralizing antibodies are better immune correlates of protection against influenza infections, non-neutralizing antibodies can also be protective by promoting viral clearance and reducing the disease severity via Fc-mediated effector functions (e.g. antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity)31,36,37,38. H7N9-specific non-neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies were found to protect recipient mice from a sublethal SH/2 challenge via FcγR engagement39.Compared to adjuvanted SH/2 eHA, immunization of adjuvanted GD/16 eHA yielded better antibody quality by showing stronger competition with H7 mAbs for HA binding. 1E9, 5A6 and 7B5 are three neutralizing mAbs raised against SH/2 HA17,18. 1E9 and 5A6 recognize epitopes in the vicinity of HA antigenic site A, while 7B5 recognizes the epitope in antigenic site B, which is close to the receptor binding site18. Passive transfer of 5A6 protected recipient mice from SH/2 CVV challenge, while 7B5 and 1E9 were also found to recognize HAs of HK/125 and GD/1618. Thus, GD/16 HA-based vaccines may exercise cross-protection via both enhanced immunogenicity and improved antibody quality.Moreover, we demonstrated that a heterologous prime-boost strategy could improve the performance of LPAI H7N9 CVVs, especially SH/2-based vaccines. Comparing the mice receiving homologous prime-boost immunization of adjuvanted SH/2 or HK/125 eHA, mice primed with adjuvanted SH/2 or HK/125 eHA followed by a heterologous booster of adjuvanted GD/16 eHA showed both enhanced immune responses and survivability after the lethal HPAI H7N9 challenge. This heterologous prime-boost strategy is important for the pandemic-influenza vaccine stockpile program, since currently tens of millions of doses of H7N9 vaccine, mostly SH/2-based, have been stockpiled by the US government for pandemic preparedness (https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda/influenza-and-emerging-infectious-diseases/pandemic-influenza-vaccine-stockpile-program/). By including GD/16 in the stockpile, we could make a good use of existing LPAI H7N9 vaccines and expand their protection coverage through the heterologous prime-boost strategy when the threat of an H7N9 pandemic looms. Additionally, we show that the recombinant approach significantly improved the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of LPAI SH/2 or HK/125 HA-based vaccines against HPAI H7N9 virus. Mice immunized with adjuvanted SH/2 or HK/125 rHA had virus-specific antibodies in similar level and quality to those administered with adjuvanted GD/16 rHA at 500 ng/mouse and were protected from the lethal HPAI wt GD/16 challenge. In humans, Flublok® based on baculovirus-expressed rHA was reported to elicit superior antibody responses than inactivated egg- or cell-based influenza vaccines16. Human antibodies elicited by AH/1 rHA vaccination were reported to broadly cross-react with emerging H7 HAs15. The improved immunogenicity and antibody quality were likely due to more stable conformational structure of rHA as compared to eHA contained in inactivated vaccines14,19,40,41. Previous studies have reported that the morphology of HA-containing structures affects the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines and inactivated split-virion or subunit vaccines containing large viral particles or spherical structures are generally more immunogenic than those (especially avian origin vaccines) containing small punctate structures19,40,41. The majority of baculovirus-expressed GD/16, SH/2 or HK/125 rHAs existed in 450-720 kDa oligomers that likely comprised 2-3 HA trimers (Supplemental Fig. 2). Under transmission electron microscopy, insect-expressed H7 rHA formed pleomorphic spheroid nanoparticles of approximately 20 nm with the size and morphology similar to those of Flublok® rHA vaccine14. Oligomeric HA has been reported to induce a higher antibody response than trimeric HA, while monomeric HA is the least immunogenic42.In conclusion, we showed that two doses of HPAI H7N9 GD/16-derived HA with adjuvant-induced robust antibody response and protected mice against the lethal challenges of LPAI and HPAI H7N9 viruses from the first and fifth waves. These results demonstrated the immunogenicity and cross-protective efficacy of GD/16-based vaccine and provided strong evidence to support its inclusion in the influenza vaccine stockpile program for pandemic preparedness.MethodsVirusesLPAI H7N9 wt AH/1 and HK/125, and HPAI H7N9 wt GD/16 are select agents and had been stored and handled in a Select Agent Program regulated Biosafety Level (BSL)-3+ facility. All H7N9 CVVs bear a monobasic cleavage site in HA and have the internal genes replaced with those of A/PR/8/34 via reverse genetics. These H7N9 CVVs were handled under BSL-2 enhanced containment. All H7N9 viruses were propagated in 9–11 day old embryonated specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs at 37 °C. Allantoic fluids were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until use. Infectivity as reflected by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) were determined using a nucleoprotein-based ELISA43.H7 HA preparationeHAs were extracted and purified from formalin-inactivated H7 CVVs following the procedures used to prepare antigens for raising standard reference antisera for vaccine potency determination44. Briefly, formalin-inactivated viruses were purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation and purified viruses (10 mg/ml) were incubated with 50 U/ml of bromelain (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO) in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.5) containing 50 mM beta-mercaptoethanol for 4 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking44. Following the first centrifugation at 30 000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C, eHAs released in the supernatant was separated via 5–20% continuous sucrose gradients at 35,000 rpm for another 16 h at 10 °C. Purified eHAs were collected using Auto Densi-Flow Density Gradient Fractionators (Labconco, Kansas City, MO) and were verified with and without deglycosylation using PNGase F (New England Biolabs) (Supplemental Fig. 1).H7 rHAs were designed to include a T4 foldon trimerization domain to ensure trimeric HA formation45,46. Briefly, the DNA sequences encoding HA ectodomain of GD/16 (without multibasic cleavage site), HK/125 or SH/2 with a T4 trimerization domain replacing the transmembrane domain and a 6xHis tag fused to the C-terminus were synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ)45,46. Group 2 chimeric rHA construct was also designed to include the globular head domain of an H6 HA (GenBank: AAO33485.1) atop of the stem region of an H3 HA (GenBank: AMB69181.1)47,48. Codon optimized DNA sequences were synthesized and were then subcloned into pFastBac1 vector for recombinant protein expression in baculovirus/insect cell system (GenScript). rHAs were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography with ≥90% purity. Trimerized rHAs were verified with and without deglycosyaltion using PNGase F (Supplemental Fig. 2).Mouse immunization and challengeSPF female adult BALB/c mice (Charles River laboratories, Frederick, MD) housed in the ABSL2 facility were primed and boosted intramuscularly with eHA or rHA alone or emulsified with AddaVaxTM (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) at a 3-week interval. Sera were collected at 3 weeks after booster for antibody determination. Immunized mice were then transferred to the ABSL3 + facility for LPAI or HPAI wt H7N9 virus challenges. Under light isoflurane anesthesia, mice were intranasally inoculated with a low dose of wt AH/1, HK/125 or GD/16 at 5 × 104 TCID50/50 µl/mouse, or a high dose of wt GD/16 at 5 × 107 TCID50/50 µl/mouse in a BSL-3+ biocontainment. In some experiments, naïve mice were injected intravenously with 100 µl/mouse of pooled hyperimmune sera followed by a lethal challenge of GD/16 IDCDC-56N (5 × 107 TCID50/50 µl/mouse) at BSL-2. BW and mortality were monitored daily for two weeks after challenges. Mice reaching humane endpoints (e.g. 30% BW loss) were immediately euthanized. All procedures were performed according to the animal study protocols approved by the FDA White Oak Animal Program Animal Care and Use Committee.IgG ELISASera were pre-treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Denka-Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) followed by heat-inactivation before antibody assessment. IgG ELISA was performed in 96-well microtiter plates pre-coated with 0.5 µg/ml of H7 rHAs43. Bound antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life technologies, Frederick, MD) followed by TMB substrate. Optical density (OD) at 450 nm was measured using a Victor V multilabel reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). IgG ELISA titers were interpolated based on a standard curve constructed using mouse hyperimmune sera collected after HPAI H7N9 challenge.Competitive ELISAH7-specific mAbs 1E9, 5A6 and 7B518 were biotinylated at 1:1 molecular ratio using iLink™ biotin antibody labeling kit (ABP Biosciences, Rockville, MD). Serially diluted mouse sera were incubated in rHA pre-coated 96-well microtiter plates at room temperature for 2 h followed by thoroughly washing. Biotinylated H7 mAbs were then added and were incubate for another 1 h. Residual biotinylated mAbs after thoroughly washing were detected using peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Life technologies) as described above. The % of residual biotinylated mAbs as compared to the wells that contained only biotinylated H7 mAbs were plotted by nonlinear regression using Prism 6 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).Microneutralization (MN) assayA cell-based MN assay was performed43 with minor modifications. Briefly, 100 TCID50 of wt LPAI AH/1, HK/125 or HPAI GD/16 were incubated with RDE-treated sera at room temperature for 1 h. The virus-serum mixtures were then incubated with Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells (2 × 104 cells/well) in 96-well tissue culture plates at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5 days. Cells with cytopathic effect were detected by staining with 1% crystal violet solution. MN titers represent the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution resulting in 100% cell viability.ELISPOTMouse IgG, IFN-ɣ or IL-4 ELISPOT was performed using Mabtech’s ELISPOT BASIC kits (Cincinnati, OH) as previously reported49 with minor modifications. For IgG ELISPOT, splenocytes were pre-activated with R848 (1 µg/ml) and mIL-2 (10 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 3 days before being added to rHA (15 µg/ml) pre-coated 96-well Multiscreen filter ELISPOT plates (EMD Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts). For IFN-ɣ or IL-4 ELISPOT, splenocytes were added to anti-IFN-ɣ or anti-IL-4 pre-coated ELISPOT plates and were restimulated with purified H7 CVVs (10 µg/ml) at 37 °C for 72 h. Cells incubated with medium or PMA/IM mixture (2 µg/ml PMA plus 2 µM IM) served as negative or positive controls. Antigen-specific spot-forming units were detected using biotinylated secondary antibodies and were counted using the AID vSpot Spectrum (Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH, Strassberg, Germany). The number of antigen-specific spots were expressed as number of spots per 106 cells after subtracting the number of spots in unstimulated negative controls. Each mouse sample was assayed in triplicates.Cell proliferationSplenocyte proliferation was determined using a Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-based ELISA kit (Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana). Dissociated splenocytes were incubated with purified H7 CVVs (20 µg/ml) or PMA/IM mixture (2 µg/ml PMA plus 2 µM IM) in black 96-well ViewPlates (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts) at 37 °C for 90 h49. After incubation with BrdU labeling solution for additional 2 h, cells were fixed and incorporated BrdU was detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell proliferation was expressed as fold induction vs the absorbance of unstimulated control cells at 450 nm. Each mouse sample was assayed in triplicates.Epitope modelingThe epitopes targeted by 1E9, 5A6 and 7B5 mAbs were mapped in the structure of SH/2 HA trimer (PDB ID: 4LN6) using Chimera (http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera)50.Statistical analysisAntibody titers were log transformed before being subjected to nonparametric test (Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons) using Prism 6 (GraphPad). The correlation between virus-specific antibody titers and mouse survival/mortality status after challenge was analyzed using logistic fit with χ2 (JMP statistical software, version 14). A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Minister for Agriculture Mary-Anne Thomas today congratulated Victorians on achieving the outcome, which will benefit industry by allowing a return to normal business and will also allow trade to many export markets again. In 2020, Victoria endured the largest ever outbreak of avian influenza on record in Australia. The outbreak involved six farms in three regions across the state testing positive between 31 July and 25 August, affecting three species with three different strains of the virus. Those responding to or affected by the detections had the additional challenge of meeting COVIDSafe requirements while bringing the outbreak under control. The response included movement restrictions for poultry, poultry products and equipment near the infected properties and a housing order – a first for Australia – where all domestic birds in Golden Plains Shire were required to be housed to limit the interaction with wild birds. To prove freedom from avian influenza, work has included almost 1400 surveillance visits and 2700 surveillance text messages. Diagnostics and research at AgriBio, Agriculture Victoria’s research laboratory, have analysed 21,650 samples since the response began on 31 July 2020. Restrictions remain near Bairnsdale with a very small Control Area for low pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza, which is expected to be lifted soon. The response to avian influenza shows how the Andrews Labor Government is delivering best practice in managing risks and responding to new challenges, ensuring the protection and the future of our industry, as set out in the Agriculture Strategy.

Viral epitranscriptome sequencing analysis has revealed that hemagglutinin (HA) mRNA of H1N1 carry eight m6A sites which are primarily enriched in 5′-DRACH-3′ sequence motif. Herein, a large-scale comparative m6A analysis was conducted to investigate the conservation patterns of the DRACH motifs that corresponding to the reference m6A sites among influenza A viruses. A total of 70,030 complete HA sequences that comprise all known HA subtypes (H1–18) collected over several years, countries, and affected host species were analysed on both mRNA and vRNA strands. The bioinformatic analysis revealed the highest degree of DRACHs conservation among all H1 sequences that clustered largely in the middle and in the vicinity to 3′ end with at least four DRACH motifs were conserved in all mRNA sequences. The major HA-containing subtypes displayed a modest DRACH motif conservation located either in the middle region of HA transcript (H3) or at the 3′ end (H5) or were distributed across the length of HA sequence (H9). The lowest conservation was demonstrated in HA subtypes that infect mostly the wild type avian species and bats. Interestingly, the total number and the conserved DRACH motifs in the vRNA were found to be much lower than those observed in the mRNA. Collectively, the identification of putative m6A topology provides a foundation for the future intervention of influenza infection, replication, and pathobiology in susceptible hosts.

Among a handful of the chemical modification added to viral mRNAs, the methylation at N6-position of adenosine (m6A) exhibits superiority to dictate viral behaviour inside the cell, and regulate the fate of virus-infected cells predominantly the oncogenic viruses3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Moreover, the m6A residues have been known to regulate essential metabolic aspects of cellular RNA including stability, translation, splicing, nuclear export, and secondary structure11,12,13. Furthermore, critical attributes of life including embryonic development, fertility, immune modulation, and homeostatic functions were reported to be controlled by m6A14,15,16.Despite m6A marks were initially identified to be incorporated in viral RNAs several decades ago, due to technological limitations at this time, topological and functional characteristics of m6A were not clear in viral-cell lifecycles17,18,19. In recent years, the ever-rising progress in epitranscriptome-wide sequencing technologies has been exploited to identify and relatively quantify m6A marks20,21,22,23,24. Hence highlights the unexplored aspects of m6A in host–pathogen interactions. The addition of the m6A marks on both cellular and viral RNA is governed by a complex group of nuclear methyltransferases (writers); these marks can be removed by another group of demethylases (erasers). Ultimately, a third group able to bind and generate a recognizable effect on the methylated transcripts (readers), all groups are collectively known as m6A machinery9,25,26,27. Installation of m6A is predominantly restricted to consensus sequence motif, the putative m6A sites significantly reported to be enriched in some 5′-DRA*CH-3′ sequences (where A* denotes the methylatable adenosine, D denotes A, G or U, R denotes A and G, and H denotes A, C or U)24,28,29.Notably, the addition of m6A on cellular transcripts has been known to be enriched mostly in the coding sequence, 3′ untranslated region, and in the vicinity to stop codons21. Moreover, the epitranscriptome-wide analysis confirmed that the majority of methylation sites were conserved among murine and Homo sapiens, which emphasize the m6A sites were maintained throughout the evolutionary process via selection pressure21,30,31. Albeit, DRACH motifs are widespread all over cellular and viral transcriptomes, a small fraction only was reported to be methylated in vivo and the underlying mechanisms for the selection of certain DRACHs to accept methylation than others remain elusive16,24.From the scanty viral epitranscriptome data, it is early to infer the accurate topology of m6A sites, mostly the highly variable viruses having various genotypes. Recently, m6A sites have been mapped in a single-nucleotide-resolution level in HIV-1, the data revealed that consensus m6A sites were relatively conserved across the tested isolates. Nonetheless, the genome of HIV-1 is characterized by a high degree of plasticity, highlighting that conservation of m6A sites implies many aspects in virus replication and/or subversion of immune-mediated responses2,32. Likewise, the m6A landscape has also been reported to be likely conserved and not restricted to certain strains in the ZIKA virus (ZIKV) model33.Vis-à-vis influenza, epitranscriptomics analysis has identified multiple m6A residues across all the segmented transcripts17. Unravelling the viral methylome of A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai isolate has been recently mapped4. The latter study confirmed the positive impact of m6A on influenza virus replication and protein expression. Therefore, the determination of m6A sites among IAVs is most likely due in near future to intervene in influenza replication in a wide range of the affected host species. Although the m6A prediction software is available for cellular transcripts34,35, the m6A viral prediction software is still lacking and epitranscriptome-wide mapping to thousands of IAVs isolates limits its practicality. Herein, we aim to utilize publicly available meta-data on influenza virus in mapping m6A sites through the DRACH signatures and to predict the evolutionary conservation patterns among influenza A viruses.ResultsIdentification of DRACH motifs in the reference HA for comparative analysisA total of 718,168 sequences were listed as IAVs sequences in the Influenza Research Database (IRD; as of December 15th, 2020). A total of 96,472 sequences were designated as full length HA sequences. From the default settings implemented in the IRD, duplicate HA sequences were removed to list only 70,030 unique HA sequences that were utilized for computational comparative analysis. Based on the previous H1N1 epitranscriptome-seq data4, eight and nine m6A sites were identified across the entire HA mRNA and vRNA, respectively (Fig. 1). However, these sites were not precisely identified due to their undescriptive and speculative characterization. Nonetheless, identified and functionally validated 12 out of 14 5′-RAC-3′ motifs corresponding to the 8 m6A sites have been mapped on mRNA4 (Fig. 1A,B). Similarly, twelve 5′-RAC-3′ motifs corresponding to the 9 m6A sites have been mapped on vRNA (Fig. 1C,D).Figure 1Locations and conserveness of the DRACH motifs utilized in this study.

The percent of each nucleotide in each position are indicated by coloured pie charts.Full size imageFrom the above-mentioned data, we adopted 14 5′-DRACH-3′ motifs for further analysis including the previously identified 12 5′-RAC-3′ motifs along with two additional 5′-DRACH-3′ motifs corresponding to the 8 previously mapped m6A sites on HA mRNA (motifs 7 and 12) (Fig. 1A,B). A total of 14 DRACH motifs were utilized as a base for subsequent conservation analysis across IAV HA mRNAs when compared with the reference A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai strain (accession number: AF389118) (Fig. 1A,B). The identified motifs were fairly distributed across the entire HA. However, clusters of motifs were in the middle of the gene and the vicinity to the 3′ end of HA mRNA (Fig. 1A). Although the reference HA sequence contains 14 5′-RAC-3′ identified motifs of interest, three did not match the wider 5′-DRACH-3′ sequences; motif 2 and 10 have incompatible H and motif 5 has incompatible D (Fig. 1A). The 14 identified wider motifs exhibited different conserveness and diversity according to the location of the nucleotide on the DRACH motif using WebLogo (Fig. 1B). Together, considering the 14 wider DRACH motifs might be more representative than the short RAC motifs for the computational conservation analysis of the putative m6A sites spanning HA mRNA of IAVs.Conservation pattern of the identified DRACH motifs among H1 subtypeTo investigate the pattern of conservation of the identified DRACH motifs corresponding to the m6A sites among all IAVs HA mRNAs, a computational comparative analysis was generated to initially exploring the conservation of the identified 14 DRACH motifs among the known HA subtypes (i.e. H1, H2, … etc.), then explore the conservation of these motifs within the H1 subtype (i.e., H1N1, H1N2, … etc.) along with the affected host species as stated later. All analysis was compared with the reference A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai strain (accession number AF389118).Concerning H1, the major subtype of IAVs that affects predominantly human and swine and harbouring the highest number of HA sequences listed on IRD (36%). A total of 25,576 entire unique HA sequences were analyzed. We identified 40 typical DRACH motifs across the complete consensus H1 sequence (Table 1). The H1 consensus sequence was aligned with the reference HA mRNA. After a comparison of the identified 14 DRACH motifs and counting the number of matches of each motif of interest with the H1 subtype, sequences revealed that 6 out of the 14 DRACH motifs were found to be highly conserved. The conservation percentage was 99% in 7th, 12th, and 13th motifs, and 95%, 90%, and 85% in 6th, 9th, and 11th motif, respectively (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1).Table 1 Summary of conserved DRACHs distributions among all IAVs HA mRNAs.Full size tableOf particular note, the conservation percentage of the 5th motif was recorded in 85% of the H1 sequences, however, did not consider a conserved motif (putative m6A site) due to lack of the complete DRACH sequence identity. Additionally, remaining motifs exhibited loss to any/all nucleotide(s) when compared with the reference sequence (Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, the conserved motifs are clustered in two regions as that identified in the HA reference transcript. Collectively, a high degree of DRACH motifs showed conservation among all H1 sequences and clustered largely in the middle and in the vicinity to 3′ end of H1 mRNAs.Conservation pattern of the identified DRACH motifs among H3, H5, and H9 subtypesLikewise, we investigated the pattern of conservation of identified the DRACH motifs in H3, H5, and H9 subtypes, which enclose 23,286, 5472, 6408 unique HA mRNA sequences, respectively (collectively represent about 50% of HA sequences listed on IRD). These subtypes infect mainly humans, swine, equine, and avian species in various geographic distributions all over the world. The conservation pattern of DRACH motifs of interest of H3 subtype revealed partial or complete loss of 9 DRACH motifs compared with the H1N1 PR8 HA reference, however, a higher degree of conservation identified in 5 motifs; 2, 7–9, and 14 with a conservation percentage 85–99% as indicated in (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 2A). Regarding the H5 consensus HA sequence, A total of 5 DRACH motifs were also found to share conservation with the reference HA; two motifs were conserved in the middle cluster of H5 transcripts; motif-7 and -8 in 99 and 75% of all H5 transcripts, respectively. Furthermore, the last three DRACH motifs were identified to be conserved as well (conservation percent 75–99) (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 2B).The H9 subtype displayed only 3 widely separated conserved motifs; near 5′ end, in the middle region, and near 3′ end with the highest degree of conservation (90–99%) among all major HA subtypes. Notably, 50% of H9 sequences at motif 14 contain RAC motif, however, lack of a complete DRACH sequence was noticed to exclude this motif from the conservation pattern (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Together, all major HA subtypes were identified to have partial DRACH sequence conservation compared with the reference sequence that clustered either in the middle region of HA transcript (H3), 3′ end of HA mRNA (H5), and distributed all over the HA sequence (H9).Conservation pattern of the identified DRACH motifs among other subtypesSimilarly, we tested the conservation pattern of the identified DRACH motifs between remaining HA sequences (i.e. the lower HA number containing subtypes) that collectively enclose 13% of all HA sequences recorded in IRD. These subtypes infect mainly the wild avian species (H10–16), human (H2 and H7), and bats (H17 and H18). The unique HA sequence numbers and the number of conserved DRACH motifs in each subtype were shown in (Fig. 2). Each HA subtype consensus sequence was aligned and compared with reference HA of interest.Figure 2Summary of conserved DRACHs among all HA subtypes of IAVs. From the centre, the HA cladding system is represented by a maximum-likelihood tree contain representing sequences of each subtype. The numbers of conserved DRACH motifs to each HA subtype that located on either vRNA or mRNA are indicated. The highly susceptible species affecting each subtype are indicated.Full size imageRegarding the H7 subtype, the highest conserved DRACH was detected in the 11th motif (95% among 2237 sequences), whilst, H4 (1646 sequences) witnessed the highest conservation in 7th and 14th DRACH. Subtypes affecting mostly avian species (H10-16) revealed DRACH motif conservation near 3′ end mostly in 11th and 13th. Markedly, bat IAV HA sequences (i.e. H17 and H18) revealed conservation at motif 13 (Table 1). It is important to note that infrequent conserved motifs were presented in this group of HA sequences; motif-1 in H11 and H2, motif-3 in H6, and motif-10 in H8 with varying conservation percentage as indicated in (Table 1). This group of HA subtypes demonstrates the lowest number of DRACH motif conservation. Collectively, the 3′ end DRACH motifs were found to be conserved in wild avian and bats sequences. Motifs 13, 11, and 7 were identified to be the highest conserved among all analyzed HA sequences (Table 1).Conservation pattern of the identified DRACH motifs among various host species and viruses within the subtypesTo deeply investigate the conservation pattern of DRACH motifs among various host species, pathogenicity, geographic locations, and further subtyping. A detailed DRACH conservation analysis was generated within subtypes implicated with major human and avian infections. H1N1 sequences comprise more than 80% of all H1 sequences recorded in IRD. H1N1 maintained the 6 previously identified conserved DRACH motifs of all H1 sequences (Table 2). To explore the effect of DRACH sequences conservation pattern on pathogenicity, the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) sequences were compared with non-pandemic sequences. Human H1N1 sequences revealed that the pH1N1 sequences have no clear differences from identified the 6 conserved DRACHs of all H1 sequences in all affected countries. In contrast, 50% of the non-pH1N1 sequences gain an additional motif (i.e. motif 8). Moreover, compared to humans, swine H1N1 sequences exhibited loss of motif-11 and gain of motif-14. Furthermore, H1N2 sequences lost motif-9 in both human and swine sequences. Markedly, motifs 6, 7, 12, and 13 were conserved regardless of viruses, species, pathogenicity, and geographic locations (Table 2).Table 2 Summary of conserved DRACHs among various species and viruses of H1 mRNAs.Full size tableSimilarly, compared to the H2 consensus sequence, human H2N2 sequences lost motif-14, while, mallard, the most common species infected by H2 sequences, lost motif-1 in H2N2 sequences (Fig. 3). Furthermore, human H3N2 sequences the sole to contain motif-14, compared to swine and avian sequences (Fig. 3). Markedly, human influenza sequences descended from zoonotic (chicken) origin; H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2 maintained the same conserved motifs of the original chicken viruses (Figs. 3, 4). Collectively, DRACH motifs seem likely to be virus-specific rather than host species-, pathogenicity-, and geographic distribution-specific.Figure 3Summary of conserved DRACH motifs among some IAVs HA mRNAs. Conserved motifs, virus, host species, and the number of sequences listed on IRD are indicated. Conservation percent is indicated on the upper side.Full size imageFigure 4Summary of conserved DRACH motifs among the H5 mRNA. Conserved motifs, virus, host species, and the number of sequences listed on IRD are indicated. The conservation percent is indicated by coloured circles.Full size imageConservation patterns of identified DRACH motifs among IAVs HA vRNAConsidering IAVs are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses36, we sought to investigate the level of conservation of DRACH motifs in the genomic sequence as well. Based on the previous H1N1 meta-data4, a total of nine putative m6A sites were identified across the entire HA vRNA which were not described before. These novel 9 m6A sites corresponding to 12 RACs which have been identified and functionally validated in the vRNA of the reference A/Puerto Rico/8/34 strain (Accession Number: AF389118)4. These 12 motifs were adopted for further analysis on HA vRNA among IAVs in this study. Likewise the m6A motifs were fairly distributed across the entire length of the mRNA of IAVs (Fig. 1C). We compared these 12 motifs among all HA subtypes. We noticed that one out of the 12 motifs did not match with the wider DRACH (i.e. motif 8) sequence. Intriguingly, this motif was found to be non-conserved in the H1 subtype (Table 3).Table 3 Summary of conserved DRACHs distributions among all IAVs HA vRNAs.Full size tableAlbeit total DRACH motifs in the vRNA in each subtype were considerably much lower compared to the mRNA of the same subtype (about 50%). A considerable level of conservation was noticed in the 12 DRACH motifs of interest in each subtype (Table 3). The highest conservation was noticed in H1 and H3 subtypes. Unlike the mRNA, H9 was reported to contain only one conserved motif (i.e. motif 5) in the HA vRNA. Additionally, the HA subtypes that infect mainly wild bird species and bats were noticed to have only a few DRACH motif conservation similar to that of the mRNA. Moreover, motifs 5, 7, and 11 recorded the highest motifs that witnessed conservation among the vRNAs of HA subtypes. Whereas motifs 2, 4 and 12 shown to have lowest conservation among IAVs.To deeply investigate the conservation pattern of DRACH motifs among various host species, pathogenicity, geographic locations, and for further subtyping in vRNA, a detailed DRACH conservation analysis was generated within the H1 subtype. We noticed that the H1N1 maintained four previously identified conserved DRACH motifs in all H1 sequences (Table 3; Supplementary Table 1). Additionally, to explore DRACH sequences conservation pattern on pathogenicity, the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) sequences compared with non-pandemic sequences. Human H1N1 sequences revealed that the pH1N1 sequences have no clear differences from the identified 4 conserved DRACHs of all H1 sequences in all affected countries. In contrast, 50% of the pH1N1 sequences gain an additional motif (i.e. motif 2) on vRNA. Additionally, the swine H1N1 gained additional motif compared to humans. Interestingly, H1N2 sequences witnessed much higher conserved DRACH than that of H1N1 sequences including 9 motifs in human H1N2 and 8 in swine. Markedly, 4 motifs were conserved regardless of viruses, species, pathogenicity, and geographic locations (Supplementary Table 1). Collectively, compared to the mRNA, the vRNA witnessed a lower conservation level in both the total and the DRACH Motifs of interest, the highest conservation was detected in the major HA− containing subtypes and much lower in HA− subtypes affecting wild avian species and bats, and H1 contain 4 conserved motifs in almost all sequences.DiscussionInfluenza A viruses are single-stranded octameric segmented RNA belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. IAVs are characterized by high mutation rates with the hemagglutinin gene (HA) confirmed to have the record highest mutation rate. HA gene is responsible for the remarkable genetic plasticity among all remaining IAVs genes. The high mutation rate along with the reassortment of IAVs segmented nature can lead to the emergence of pandemics. Additionally, IAVs can infect a wide range of host species including humans, animal, and avian species suggesting the likely roles to cross species barriers and causing zoonotic fatal infections36,37,38.The epigenetic m6A mark is the most abundant internal chemical modification installed onto both cellular and viral mRNA that dictate various cell behaviours and the fate of the virus-host interaction2,39. The significance of m6A has been highlighted by the fact that this modification is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates31, besides, a high degree of conservation in the majority of m6A machinery has recently been confirmed among vertebrates9. Furthermore, the overall inhibition of m6A has various detrimental effects on animals' life13. Therefore, the determination of the characteristic features and topology of viral m6A is of paramount importance to modulate the outcome of the virus-host battle. However, the utilized methods to precisely determine the locations of m6A marks remain limited in viral epitranscriptomics, laborious, and non-cost-effective to investigate thousands of virus strains. Moreover, the highly evolving nature of viruses could complicate this notion.Among viruses, influenza was the first model identified to express mRNAs harbour multiple m6A marks in the 1970s17,19. These earlier studies identified 24 m6A sites across the entire segmented genome with eight of which detected in the HA mRNA via biochemical analysis. In agreement with recent high-throughput sequencing data using PAR-CLIP and PA-m6A-seq, eightine prominent m6A sites were identified across the HA mRNA/vRNA of H1N14, respectively. However, the adopted approaches of sequencing did not provide a precise determination of the methylated adenosines at single-nucleotide resolution. In this milieu, we utilized the commonly used consensus sequence where m6A marks are installed; the DRACH motif that was described in cellular transcriptome-wide maps21,30. Moreover, the m6A individual-nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) sequence data revealed that m6A were markedly more prevalent in the DRACH sequence context24. Furthermore, several loss-of-function experiments have tested the functionality of m6A marks through mapping along with synonymous ablation of the DRACH motifs from both cellular40 and viral transcripts4,5,41. Therefore, we exploited the DRACH motif to figure the pattern of conservation among IAVs through comparative analysis. This wider motif could narrow the window against the evolving nature of the IAVs than the shorter RAC motif.It is plausible that the number of RAC/DRACH motifs could be higher than the number of the actual m6A sites, as multiple close motifs might be present underneath the m6A detection peak mostly in the non-single-nucleotide-resolution approaches, which could be a challenge to confirm the methylated adenosines. This is a characteristic feature for m6A additions to cellular transcripts24. Regarding influenza, the introduction of 12 out of 14 synonymous mutations to the short RAC motifs corresponding to the eight m6A sites on mRNA has been performed4. The two other RAC motifs have not been mutated without alteration of the amino acid code (identified here as motif-7 and 12, Fig. 1A). Herein, these 14 motifs were used as a base for conservation analysis. Three RAC motifs did not match with the wider DRACH identity, thus could be highly unlikely real m6A sites. Surprisingly, our comparative analysis on mRNA revealed that these 3 motifs had the lowest conservation among IAVs (Table 1). Notably, m6A methyltransferases are strictly favouring installing m6A on highly conserved consensus sequence42.A bioinformatic approach is adopted here to predict the highly conserved DRACH motifs that corresponding to m6A sites across HA mRNA/vRNA. We focused only on the HA genes as it encodes the highly variable major viral structural glycoprotein43 and the HA gene only was fully mapped in previous literature4. The IRD was adopted to decipher the conservation patterns of DRACH motifs of interest utilizing its implemented bioinformatic algorithms between approximately 70,000 complete HA sequences44. Six out of the 14 full DRACH motifs were identified to share conservation of 85–99% of the H1 subtype sequences (more than 25,000 HA sequences) compared with the reference H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai. This high level of conservation highlights that these putative m6A sites are not PR8 specific among a highly variable virus generally and HA specifically38. Furthermore, clustering of the conserved motifs in the middle and vicinity to 3′ end suggests an underlying 3D RNA structure, mRNA folding, and stability regulatory function as previously described in the HIV-1 model2,32. Notably, the middle cluster DRACHs are located near the junction between HA1 and HA2 fragments (Supplementary Fig. 2). Albeit, some variations were observed through in-depth comparative analysis demonstrated by DRACH gain or loss among various host species affected by viruses of H1 subtype, four motifs were conserved whatever the affected host species, virus collection date, and geographic location (Table 2), similarly, the same conservation pattern was found in the HA vRNA among IAVs (Table 3, Supplementary Table 1).Likewise, the conservation of the DRACH motifs of interest in HA mRNAs of H3, H5, and H9 subtypes (collectively comprising more than 50% HA sequences) were confirmed. Of note, the HA cladding system categorizes H1, H5, and H9 sequences as clade I, whilst H3 sequences belonging to clade II based on the entire HA sequence phylogeny45 (Fig. 2). Nonetheless, H3 HA sequences are still harboring at least 85% conservation of not only the middle cluster DRACH motifs namely 7–9 that constitute a part of the HA1 fragment, but conservation of motif-14 at the HA2 fragment was also noticed. Moreover, the available H5 and H9 HA sequences maintain a pattern of conservation to those DRACH motifs of both the middle region and near the 3′ end of HA.In a trial to address influenza pathogenicity and m6A sites correlations, the in-depth comparative analysis showed that the low pathogenic avian influenza virus of chicken-H5N2 harbours lower conserved DRACH motifs compared with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of chicken-H5N1 and -H5N846,47,48,49. In contrast to this finding, the pandemic H1N1 sequences show lower conserved DRACH motifs compared with non-pandemic sequences50 (Table 2). Interestingly, on mRNA human influenza HA sequences that originated from avian species H5N1, H9N2, and H7N9 share the same DRACH motifs of the original chicken viruses (Fig. 3). Same finding was confirmed in vRNA as well between human influenza HA sequences that originated from avian species H5N1, H9N2, and H7N9 (Data not shown). Considering the enhanced pathogenicity of zoonotic viruses as confirmed by mortalities after transmission to humans38 compared with low pathogenic nature in chicken (i.e. H9N2, H7N9) seems peculiar to connect to pathogenicity (Fig. 3). Furthermore, conservation of the same DRACH motifs from various host species (i.e. human, chicken, turkey, duck, goose, and environmental isolates in the H5N1 model) was observed (Fig. 4). Collectively, it seems that the conserved DRACH motifs (the putative m6A sites) pointing to be virus-specific predominantly rather than to be host species-, pathogenicity-, clade-, and geographic-specific even in various forms of RNA to the same virus model. The same findings were noticed in HIV-1 and Zika virus models2,32,33. However, large-scale functional studies warrant further investigation to support this notion.The remaining IAVs subtypes that infect mostly the wild avian species, humans, and bats (collectively comprise 13% of the HA sequences listed on IRD) harbour the infrequent conserved DRACH motifs; motif-1 in H2 and H11, motif-3 in H6, and motif 10 in H8. The scanty number of HA sequences identified so far per each subtype could be the cause of this finding, and higher numbers are required to give an appropriate interpretation. Nonetheless, the highest conserved DRACH motifs among the remaining subtype HA sequences; motifs-13, -11, and 7 are still observed (Table 1). These observations highlight that the putative m6A sites of this group of IAVs subtypes are conserved regardless of the low pathogenicity in the affected host species51 and might be connected to the influenza virus itself. However, functional testing is still required. The massive numbers of HA sequences analysed here revealed that the lowest DRACH motifs to encounter conservation are motifs 5 and 10. It can be seen that these motifs in the PR8 reference sequence lack the full DRACH sequence identity on mRNA. Likewise the case in mRNA, motif 8 on HA vRNA that lacks the full DRACH sequence identity of PR8 were found be less conserved among H1 subtype (about 25,000 sequences). Notably, unlike PR8, motif 2 was found to encounter conservation in 5 HA subtypes which harbour the correct DRACH sequences identity (Table 1). Intriguingly, cellular transcripts prediction software SRAMP34 also confirmed that 5 DRACHs are shared in PR8 conserved motifs described here; 6, 7, 11, 12, and 13 (data not shown). The 13th DARCH motif recorded the highest confidence site. However, other sites predicted in SRAMP did not match mostly with the publicly available PR8 mapped sites.Reduction of the conserved DRACH motifs of interest among the newly emerged influenza viruses in bats the H17 and H18 and most influenza viruses characterized in wild birds (H13–16) remains in question. Notably, all HA subtypes share comparable numbers of total DRACH sites on the entire HA consensus sequences (36–47 DRACH sites) (Table 1). Additionally, the lower number of the total and DRACH sequences of interest in vRNAs compared with mRNAs might emphasize the importance of this signature on the translation and stability to mRNA, however, further functional validations are in need in near future. Further analysis to decipher the association with the level of m6A sites and the replication efficiency and pathogenicity in these species is required. Ultimately, future efforts to precisely map m6A sites on various viral transcripts coupled with the targeted mutagenesis of m6A sites will be a valuable tool to modulate the fate of the virus-host battle, a step toward the intervention of critical pathogens. Additionally, will assist in the generation of viral m6A prediction software to unveil critical aspects in infection cell biology.Materials and methodsDetermination of the reference viral transcript for comparative analysisBased on the public IAV epitranscriptome-wide profiling data4, a comparative assessment was performed. Briefly, they utilized two different sequencing techniques to map various m6A sites across H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai isolate20,23. Based on m6A-seq, a total of eightine m6A sites were identified across the entire hemagglutinin (HA) mRNA and vRNA, respectively (NCBI Accession # AF389118) and functionally confirmed their sequence analysis through synonymous mutation of 12 out of 14 short 5′-RAC-3′ motifs corresponding to the 8 identified m6A sites on the mRNA and the 9 identified m6A sites on the vRNA4 because the adopted sequencing approaches were not sensitive to identify the m6A sites in a single-nucleotide-resolution level. Herein, we utilized both the mRNA- and vRNA-HA from A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai as references for further computational comparative analysis to test the conservation patterns of putative m6A sites among all HA subtypes of IAVs.HA dataset collectionNucleotide sequences of the entire HA gene of all IAVs were retrieved from the NIAID Influenza Research Database (IRD www.FluDB.org). We adopted in the settings that all HA subtypes from H1 through H18 were separately selected. In each HA subtype all possible neuraminidase (NA) subtyping, host species, date range, and geographic distribution were included. For further analysis, certain settings to include specific viruses within subtype(s) (i.e. H1N1, H1N2… etc.) or specific host species were adopted as stated later. Laboratory strains and duplicated sequences were excluded from the computational analysis. The influenza H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai (AF389118) was added to each HA subtype to serve as a reference strain for subsequent comparison.Multiple sequence alignment, generation of consensus sequences, and identification of the conserved DRACH sitesMultiple sequence alignments (MSA) were generated to the long open reading frame of each tested HA subtype (i.e. H1-H18, separately) using the MUSCLE algorithm of the MSA tool implemented in IRD44. The computed and visualized MSA results together with the derived consensus sequences downloaded in FASTA format. Geneious software (v9.1.4) was used to further confirm the alignment and the generated consensus sequences utilizing the same MSA algorithm52. The latter software can provide consensus sequences based on the given threshold frequency (TF) percentage and display the non-consistent bases as IUPAC degenerate nucleotides. Each HA subtype consensus sequence was aligned with the reference H1N1 HA sequence using the Clustal W algorithm, Lasergene software package, version 3.18 (DNASTAR, Madison, WI) for identification of mutation hotspots, and prediction of nucleotide changes, then visualized using BioEdit program, v7.2.5 (Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA)53. A putative m6A site was considered specific and conserved if has the full 5′-DRACH-3′ motif sequence (D = A, G or T; R = A or G; H = A, C or T) when compared with the reference HA sequence and presented by the lowest conservation percentage of the total number sequences of the analysed subtype.Conserveness of DRACH motifsConserveness and diversity of all putative motifs were identified using WebLogo https://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi54, in which DRACH motifs (5 nucleotides) presented as stacks, each stack for a position in the sequence, the height of the stack indicates the sequence conservation at that position, the height of symbols within the stack indicates the relative frequency of each nucleotide at this position.

Persons with HIV (PWH) have a compromised immune response and are thought to be at higher risk for severe RV disease. However, very little is known about the host immune response to RV infection in PWH. Here, we investigated gene expression changes in the peripheral blood of PWH co-infected with RV. Only very few differentially expressed genes could be detected between PWH with and without RV infection, suggesting that the immune response to RV in PWH is strongly dampened. Our data provides important insights into the host response to RV infections in HIV patients.

The most severe influenza human pandemic in 1918 resulted in about 30 million fatal casualties3 and the current coronavirus pandemic has already resulted in over 700,000 deaths (WHO situation report 2020). Seasonal RV infections also represent a major health hazard causing morbidity, mortality, and enormous loss of the work force yearly1,4,5. Very little is known about the immune response in persons with HIV (PWH) after RV infection. Symptoms of RV infection appear to be similar in PWH and non-HIV patients6. However, in a study of 358 PWH infected with influenza virus (IV), lower respiratory tract disease incidence was 4–8 times higher than in non-HIV patients infected with IV only7. In addition, HIV-IV co-infected patients were more likely to have other bacterial infections7,8,9,10. Evidence from antiretroviral therapy (ART)-limited regimens demonstrates that HIV infection is a risk factor for higher rates of hospitalization, need for supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilation compared to PWH without RV infections11,12. Treatment with high-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) decreased mortality after influenza infections by three to sixfold in PWH but still remained higher than in non-HIV patients13. Thus, PWH are thought to be at higher risk for more severe outcomes after RV infection. In a review of the literature in 2016, González Álverez et al.13 concluded that PWH may be at higher risk for bacterial superinfection because of their humoral and cellular immune suppression. In agreement with this, coinfection and immunosuppression were found to be a major risk factor for influenza mortality8. On the other hand, PWH demonstrate a diminished cytokine response, which may actually be protective against severe hyper-inflammatory responses, often observed in severe RV infections13. In general, evidence of the impact of HIV infection in RV severity is scarce and often contradictory because stratification of the immune status is often absent in RV-infected patients13.To gain more insight into the host immune response to RV in PWH, we performed a blood transcriptome study in PWH after RV infection and aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to PWH without RV infection. We found only very few DEGs between HIV-RV co-infected and HIV-only patients. These results indicate that PWH mount a less robust immune response after infection with RV.ResultsPatient cohortWe collected samples from HIV-infected and HIV-RV co-infected patients which consisted of 40 HIV-only infected, and 18 HIV-RV co-infected patients (Table 1) collected between August 2015 and August 2018. In addition, we added 4 non-HIVon-RV healthy controls to the transcriptome study for a trend analysis. Table S1 lists the clinical characteristics for each individual patient.Table 1 Characteristics of cohort, stratified by infectious status.Full size tableIdentification of differentially expressed genesWe determined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between non-infected and infected PWH using a threshold of absolute fold changes > 1.5 (log2 = 0.58496) and a BH multiple testing adjusted p value of < 0.1. We identified 12 DEGs, 7 up- and 5 down-regulated genes (Table S2). Figure 1 shows the corresponding Volcano plot (Fig. 1a), heatmap for all DEGs (Fig. 1b), and individual expression levels of the top four up- and down-regulated DEGs (Fig. 1c, d, respectively). These findings suggest that the immune response in PWH with RV infection is dampened compared to PWH baseline.Figure 1Visualization of DEGs in PWH cohort.

This may be due to a biological difference or simply due to a small sample size. Therefore, we performed a power analysis to determine if the sample size in our cohort would in principle will be large enough to detect DEGs with a fold change of 1.5 and a false discovery rate of 0.1. Using the R package ssizeRNA14 which has been developed for power calculations of RNAseq data, we calculated a power of 0.83 to detect 5% of genes as DEGs in a two group comparison with a sample size of 18 for the smaller group. Thus, if the number of DEGs in our data set was 1000 or more, we would have detected them with an 83% chance (80% is generally used as threshold for statistical analyses). If the number of DEGs in our data set was 500 or less, the power to detect DEGs with these thresholds drops to 0.64. Thus, we conclude that the sample size in our cohort was sufficiently large for detecting many more DEGs for the thresholds chosen.To further support our hypothesis, we analyzed a published data set in which patients with respiratory infections were compared to controls in non-HIV patients15. The published non-HIV cohort consisted of 115 RV-infected patients and 88 controls (patients with non-infectious illness). In this cohort, we detected 3833 DEGs when contrasting infected to controls, 1902 up-regulated and 1931 down-regulated genes, using a threshold of absolute fold change > 1.5 and a BH multiple testing adjusted p value of < 0.05 (Table S3). The expression levels of the top four genes [Interferon Induced Protein 44 Like (IFI44L), Sialic Acid Binding Ig Like Lectin 1 (SIGLEC1), Interferon Induced Protein 44 (IFI44), Radical S-Adenosyl Methionine Domain Containing 2 (RSAD2)] up-regulated in non-HIV patients are shown in Fig. 2. Most remarkably, no significant differences between non-infected and RV-infected PWH were found in our HIV-cohort (Fig. 2) for these genes.Figure 2Comparison of expression levels of top regulated genes from non-HIV cohort.

The top four genes up-regulated in the non-HIV cohort are shown for the non HIV-cohort in (a) and for the PWH cohort in (b). All pairwise differences in (a) are statistically significant (p < 0.01); all differences in (b) are not significantly different.

Therefore, we simulated the sample sizes from our data set and randomly selected 18 subjects with RV infections and 40 controls (sample sizes in our cohort) from the published non-HIV data set of Tsalik et al.15. For these randomly selected samples, we calculated the number of differentially expressed genes using the same thresholds as in our HIV study. The simulation was repeated 50 times. We detected on average 3738.56 DEGs (SEM = 137.99)—many more than the 12 DEGs that were detected in our PWH cohort. These results demonstrate that it is possible to detect a large number of differentially expressed genes in patients without HIV.Taken together, the above findings support our hypothesis that the immune response in PWH is strongly dampened during respiratory viral infection compared to non-HIV infected patients.LimitationsOur study has several limitations. We identified very few differentially expressed genes. This should in principle not be due to the small sample size of infected (18) versus non-infected HIV (40) patients, as we showed in our power analysis and the simulation of published data for non-HIV patients. However, it is possible that more DEGs would be detected if the sample size was increased.The main emphasis of our study was to compare PWH with and without RV infection. Therefore, we included only a few healthy control samples from non-infected non-HIV patients. The sample size for these controlled samples was much too small to perform statistically significant contrasts, and we only used this group to describe trends. We speculate that in HIV patients, the expression of many innate immune genes was already upregulated, regardless of respiratory viral co-infection status. In order to support this speculation, it would be necessary to include a larger set of infected and non-infected samples from patients without HIV.The sample size of PWH (18) was too small to identify significant effects of covariates, such as sex, viral load, cell counts, and anti-retroviral treatment. Nevertheless, we contrasted patients with high (> 102; 6 samples) to patients with low (0; 12 samples) viral loads in the group of RV-infected PWH. We only found two DEGs (KLHDC7B upregulated, and ZFP57 down-regulated). We conclude that that the sample sizes were too low for a meaningful comparison and that studies on the effect of covariates will have to be repeated with much larger sample sizes.Our analysis was based on RNASeq as the method for transcriptome analysis. The published data set which we used for our comparison to a non-HIV cohort was obtained from a microarray study. Therefore, although very unlikely, it is possible that the observed differences in outcome are due to different technologies being used.Lastly, as is the case for many human studies, replication in another independent cohort will be important to confirm our findings.DiscussionHere, we analyzed gene expression changes in PWH after respiratory infections. We identified 12 DEGs in the comparison of non-RV-infected patients to RV-infected patients. Below, we discuss the top four up-and down-regulated DEGs that were at least fourfold different as examples. However, this should not be taken to mean that others are less relevant.The top four genes up-regulated in PWH with RV infection were FFAR3, NTSR1, MROH5, CCNA1. The Free Fatty Acid Receptor 3 (FFAR3) gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). It plays a role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and in intestinal immunity, regulating the production of chemokines and cytokines in intestinal epithelial cells16. Neurotensin Receptor 1 (NTSR1) encodes a protein that belongs to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors. NTSR1 mediates the functions of neurotensin, e.g. hypotension, hyperglycemia, hypothermia, antinociception, and intestinal motility and secretion16. Maestro Heat Like Repeat Family Member 5 (MROH5) does not have any known biological functions. Cyclin A1 (CCNA1) encodes a protein of the cyclin family. It functions as regulator of CDK kinases characterized by a periodicity in the cell cycle. It binds to other cell cycle regulators, such as retinoblastoma (Rb) family proteins, transcription factor E2F-1, and the p21 family proteins16.The top four genes down-regulated in PWH with RV infection were ADARB2, GGT5, PMP22, VMO1. Adenosine Deaminase RNA Specific B2 (ADARB2) encodes a protein that is a member of the double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase family of RNA-editing enzymes16. Gamma-Glutamyltransferase 5 (GGT5) encodes a protein that is a member of the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase gene family. It converts leukotriene C4 to leukotriene D416. Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) encodes an integral membrane protein that is a major component of myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in this gene are associated with various neurological diseases16. Vitelline Membrane Outer Layer 1 Homolog (VMO1) has no known biological function16.In conclusion, there was no obvious shared biological function for the identified DEGs. Also, with the exception of FFAR3, none of the genes has a known function in host immunity or pathogen defense. Performing a functional analysis (like KEGG, Reactome or GO) was not appropriate, since the number of DEGs was so small.In total, surprisingly few DEGs were identified in our PWH cohort compared to what would be expected in a data set with this sample size, based on our power analysis. In addition, we simulated the sample sizes in a published data set from non-HIV patients, and this analysis indicated that a much larger number of DEGs would have been observed in a similarly powered cohort of non-HIV patients. Furthermore, the most strongly regulated genes in this non-HIV cohort did not show any significant differences in our PWH cohort. Therefore, we conclude from our analyses of gene expression changes in the peripheral blood that in PWH, inflammatory responses in the blood were not activated by respiratory viral infection in PWH to the same extent that they are in non-HIV patients, and the host immune response in PWH patients to RV infections is strongly dampened.Although we could not confirm all findings that were cited in a review by González Álvarez et al.13, our observations are in agreement with the general conclusions from their studies, namely that the host response to RV infection is very different and compromised in PWH compared to patients without HIV. This finding may underlie the observation that PWH are at higher risk for severe influenza disease.González Álvarez et al.13 also reported that CXCL10 was consistently increased in PWH. In our dataset, we actually observed a lower level of CXCL10 expression in HIV-RV co-infected versus PWH without RV. However, this difference was not significant. It should be noted that we analyzed the gene expression changes and not protein levels in the blood. CXCL10 protein is also secreted into the blood stream from lung tissues after IV infection. The CXCL10 expression levels were, however, strongly and significantly increased in the non-HIV cohort after RV infection (Table S3).Previous work described a weak B-cell response to influenza vaccination in PWH17. However, we could not detect a significant down-regulation of B cell markers (CD79A, MS4A1, LINC00926, CD79B, TCL1A, HLA-DQA1, VPREB3, HLA-DQB1, CD74, HLA-DRA) in our patient cohort. It should be noted that we studied transcriptome responses of all cells in peripheral blood and the B-cell signature may not be apparent because it increases at later stages in the course of an infection. It is expected to be absent during the early stages which we studied, when people present with symptoms.In conclusion, PWH mount a minimal immune response in the peripheral blood after infection with respiratory viruses compared to patients without HIV. Our results represent insights to better understand the host response to RV infections in PWH with a compromised immune response at the molecular level.MethodsEthics statementAll methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was obtained for study participation and/or their legal guardians. The protocols for this study have been approved by the IRB of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, IRB Numbers: 13-2140 and 15-3179.Sample collection and preparation of RNAPeripheral blood in the HIV cohort was collected into Tempus Blood RNA Tubes (Applied Biosystems) and RNA isolated using the MagMAX Sample Extraction kit (Life Technologies, Germany) as described by the manufacturer. The non-HIV cohort sampling of total blood and RNA preparation (PAXgene Blood RNA Kit; Qiagen) has been described in detail previously15.SequencingQuality and integrity of total RNA was controlled on the Bioanalyzer Instrument (Agilent Technologies; Waldbronn, Germany). For the library construction, globin mRNA was depleted from total RNA using the GLOBINclear Kit, human (ThermoFisher, Invitrogen). Subsequently, a strand-specific RNA sequencing library was generated using NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer’s protocols. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000 using HiSeq 3000/4000 SBS Kit (300 cycles) with an average of 51 M reads per sample.Data processing and analysisReads were quality checked with package FastQC18 (version 0.11.4), then trimmed using Trimgalore (version 0.4.419) with default settings. Trimmed reads were mapped to human genome annotation hg38 (ENSMBL hg38 release 91) using STAR20 (version 2.5.2b) with default settings. Number of raw reads per sample: mean of 50,875,283), trimmed reads per sample: mean of 50,817,247), uniquely mapped reads per sample: mean of 48,400,288), and percentage of mapped reads per sample: mean of 95%). Mapped reads were counted using RsubRead21 (version 1.32.4). Raw counts were normalized and log2 transformed using DESeq222 (version 1.16.1). Differentially expressed genes were identified using the function DESeqDataSetFromMatrix and DESeq in the package DESeq2. Subsequently, analysis and visualization of expression data was performed using the R software package23 (version 3.4.0) on the log2 normalized expression levels generated by the function rlogTransformation in the package DESeq2. The R package ssizeRNA (version 1.3.2)14 was used for a power calculation to detect DEGs in our cohort with the following parameter settings: FDR = 0.1; sample size = 18; dispersion = 0.1, number of genes = 20,000; number of simulations = 10, up-regulated genes = 50%; mean counts for control group calculated from our data = 2079). For beeswarm graphs of expression levels, package beeswarm24 (version 0.2.3.) was used. Published data set for non-HIV patients: Processed array data were downloaded from the GEO expression database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, ID: GSE63990) and analyzed using the R software25. Downloaded data was log2-transformed and quantile normalized. Only data from RV-infected patients and controls (non-infection-illness) was used in this study; patients with bacterial infections were not included. For identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the LIMMA package26 (version 3.32.4) using BH correction for multiple testing27. For the simulation studies, the corresponding number of samples (18 for controls and 40 for infected) were randomly selected from the data set and DEGs were identified using a threshold of absolute fold changes > 1.5 (log2 = 0.58496) and a BH multiple testing adjusted p value of < 0.1 which is identical to the method of identifying DEGs in our PWH cohort. The simulations were repeated 50 times and the average number of DEGs and the corresponding standard error of means (SEM) was determined. Data availability Raw and processed data are available at GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/); ID: GSE155352 for our HIV-cohort.

Here’s How to Recover By Nina Bahadur Updated Feb 24, 2021 Medically Reviewed by Dayle Davenport, MD Our Editorial Process Meet Our Experts It may take some time for you to fully regain your strength following a bout of the flu. Image Credit: Charday Penn/iStock/GettyImages Once the symptoms of a cold or the flu are gone, it can still take some time to regain strength and fully recover from these energy-sapping ailments. Experts recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, slowly returning to your old routines and focusing on nourishing, healthy food and drinks.

Video of the Day Video of the Day All About Colds and the Flu As Harvard Health Publishing says, the flu is a contagious respiratory virus caused by one of three different types: influenza A, B or C. Flu symptoms — which can include fever, body aches, chills, a sore throat, runny nose, diarrhea, nausea and fatigue — typically last for five to seven days. If you have influenza, the Mayo Clinic recommends bed rest and plenty of fluids to help yourself heal and suggests that you stay home until you have been fever free for at least 24 hours. Advertisement We Recommend Health 157 Flu Statistics and Facts You Should Know Health How to Prevent and Soothe a Sore Throat After Drinking Alcohol Health 7 Reasons You Might Have a Painful Neck and Sore Throat The common cold, which is caused by different viruses, has symptoms that can include coughing, sneezing, fever, a runny nose, sore throat, congestion and headache, the Cleveland Clinic says. These symptoms may last for seven to 10 days. Sometimes using over-the-counter medications can help, Cleveland Clinic says (but they may not be appropriate for children, so check with your pediatrician first). Don't be alarmed if you feel completely drained after recovering from the flu or a cold. Take the time to rest if you are tired. "Getting enough sleep is like giving your body a big break to regenerate and helps your immune system recover," says Luiza Petre, MD, a cardiologist and weight management and nutrition expert in New York City. "The goal is to have at least seven to eight hours per night, and nap whenever your body is asking for it." Advertisement We Recommend Health 157 Flu Statistics and Facts You Should Know Health How to Prevent and Soothe a Sore Throat After Drinking Alcohol Health 7 Reasons You Might Have a Painful Neck and Sore Throat Dr. Petre also recommends monitoring your diet when you're overcoming a sickness. "Your body needs extra vitamins and minerals during this time," she says. "Eat a wide range of colorful fruits and vegetables ... and increase your intake of water, anti-inflammatory foods and whole foods that are easy to digest." Exercising After Illness You might be eager to get back into your usual workout routine, but experts warn against pushing yourself. "Chances are that you've spent a lot of time in bed the last few days," Dr. Petre says. "Your muscles and joints have probably become stiff and achy, and returning to your regular routine could be uncomfortable or even cause an injury. Start with some long, slow stretches to warm up your muscles again, such as yoga." Advertisement Advertisement Make sure you feel up to exercising, and monitor how your body feels. Don't be afraid to take breaks if you need them. "Take it easy on the first day back," recommends Robert Williams, MD, a Colorado-based family medicine doctor and geriatrician. "Start at about 10 percent of the energy you would normally use," he suggests. "If you start to get dizzy, wheeze or feel nauseated, make sure to dial back the intensity. Drink plenty of fluids before, during and after the workout." Advertisement Still Weak After Being Sick While it's normal to feel weak and tired while you are recovering, persistent weakness and exhaustion may be a sign that you are in fact still sick. If you're worried about your energy levels or sleep habits after being ill, seek your doctor's advice on the best course of treatment. "As always, consult your doctor, dietitian or nutritionist for expert advice," Dr. Petre says. "When recovering from an illness, it's best to ease your way back in by taking baby steps when returning to work, life and fitness routines. You'll bounce back in no time." ‌Read more:‌ 5 Uncommon Ways to Fend Off Cold and Flu references Robert Williams, MD, family medicine doctor and geriatrician, Colorado Luiza Petre, MD, cardiologist, weight management and nutrition expert, New York City Mayo Clinic: “Influenza (Flu)” Harvard Health Publishing: “How Long Does the Flu Last?” Cleveland Clinic: “Common Cold, Overview” Cleveland Clinic: “Common Cold: Management and Treatment” Is this an emergency?

WuHave We Already Ruined Our Next COVID Summer?Katherine J. WuWhy Can’t We Just Call BA.2 Omicron?Sarah ZhangThe Final Pandemic BetrayalEd YongHealthA Simple Rule of Thumb for Knowing When the Pandemic Is OverAt some point—maybe even soon—the emergency phase of the pandemic will end. But what, exactly, is that magic threshold?By Alexis C. MadrigalThe AtlanticFebruary 23, 2021 ShareSave In the middle of January, the deadliest month of the pandemic, one day after inauguration, the Biden administration put out a comprehensive national strategy for “beating COVID-19.” The 200-page document includes many useful goals, such as “Restore trust with the American people” and “Mount a safe, effective, and comprehensive vaccination campaign.” But nowhere does it give a quantitative threshold for when it will be time to say, “Okay, done—we’ve beaten the pandemic.”A month later, it’s time to get specific. The facts are undeniable: The seven-day average of new cases in the United States has fallen by 74 percent since their January peak, hospitalizations have gone down by 58 percent, and deaths have dropped by 42 percent. Meanwhile, more than 60 million doses of vaccine have gone into American arms. At some point—maybe even some point relatively soon—the remaining emergency measures that were introduced in March 2020 will come to an end. But when, exactly, should that happen?The problem is that the “end of the pandemic” means different things in different contexts. The World Health Organization first declared a “public health emergency of international concern” on January 30, 2020, holding off on labeling it a “pandemic” until March 11. The imposition (and rescinding) of these labels is a judgment made by WHO leadership, and one that can reflect murky, tactical considerations. Regardless of what the WHO decides (and when), national governments—and individual states within the U.S.—have to make their own determinations about when and how to reopen their schools and loosen their restrictions on businesses. I reached out to prominent public-health experts to find out which epidemiological criteria ought to be met before these kinds of steps are taken.The most obvious interpretation of “beating COVID-19” would be that transmission of the coronavirus has stopped, a scenario some public-health experts have hashtagged #ZeroCOVID. But the experts I spoke with all agreed that this won’t happen in the U.S. in the foreseeable future. “This would require very high levels of vaccination coverage,” said Celine Gounder, an infectious-disease specialist at NYU who served on Joe Biden’s coronavirus task force during the transition. The U.S. may never reach vaccination rates of 75 to 85 percent, the experts said.Read: The good news of COVID-19 is sticking for now“The question is not when do we eliminate the virus in the country,” said Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center and an expert in virology and immunology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Rather, it’s when do we have the virus sufficiently under control? “We’ll have a much, much lower case count, hospitalization count, death count,” Offit said. “What is that number that people are comfortable with?” In his view, “the doors will open” when the country gets to fewer than 5,000 new cases a day, and fewer than 100 deaths.That latter threshold, of 100 COVID-19 deaths a day, was repeated by other experts, following the logic that it approximates the nation’s average death toll from influenza. In most recent years, the flu has killed 20,000 to 50,000 Americans annually, which averages out to 55 to 140 deaths a day, said Joseph Eisenberg, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. “This risk was largely considered acceptable by the public,” Eisenberg said. Monica Gandhi, an infectious-disease specialist at UC San Francisco, made a similar calculation. “The end to the emergency portion of the pandemic in the United States should be heralded completely by the curtailing of severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths from COVID-19,” she said. “Fewer than 100 deaths a day—to mirror the typical mortality of influenza in the U.S. over a typical year—is an appropriate goal.”The “flu test” proposed here is not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison. Deaths attributed to COVID-19 are directly reported to public-health authorities, while the mortality numbers from seasonal flu are CDC estimates based on national surveillance data that have been fed into statistical models. But researchers believe that the straightforward counts of influenza deaths—just 3,448 to 15,620 in recent years—are substantially too low, while direct counts of COVID-19 deaths are likely to be more accurate. One big reason: Far more COVID-19 tests are done in a single day than flu tests in an entire year, and flu tests have a greater tendency to return false negatives.In any case, we are nowhere near 100 COVID-19 deaths a day. Since last spring, states have not reported fewer than 474 deaths a day, as measured by a rolling seven-day average at the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic. Right now, the country as a whole is still reporting close to 2,000 deaths a day, and just two weeks ago that number was more than 3,000. So, if we’re going by the flu test, we still have a very long way to go.Read: The most likely timeline for life to return to normalSome experts were even more conservative. Crystal Watson, a health-security scholar at Johns Hopkins University, suggested a threshold of 0.5 newly diagnosed cases per 100,000 people every day, and a test-positivity rate of less than 1 percent. That would translate to fewer than 2,000 cases a day in the U.S., compared with the current 60,000 or more. We’d also want to log at least one month of normal hospital operations without staff or equipment shortages, she said.While every proposed threshold remains far below what we’re seeing right now, the researchers I spoke with believe that if vaccine uptake is high enough, those numbers can be reached. Watson suggested a target of 80 percent coverage for populations older than 65, and 70 to 80 percent for everyone else. For the latter, “perhaps 60 percent is more realistic,” she said.So far, no state has reached those vaccination levels in any population. It is possible, however, that in specific, high-risk subpopulations, targeted efforts could drive vaccination rates to very high levels. Our best example is in long-term-care facilities, which have been linked to 35 percent of total COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. The federal government’s vaccine rollout made residents and staff in these facilities a priority and provided specific funds and operational help to vaccinate these people beginning in December. At the COVID Tracking Project, we’ve seen the share of deaths attributed to long-term-care facilities drop by more than half over the past six weeks, which suggests the vaccines are working.The large number of Americans who’ve already been infected will also be crucial for reaching transmission-slowing levels of immunity. The CDC estimates that more than 83 million Americans have been infected with COVID-19, far more than the official, confirmed case total of 28 million. Forty-four million Americans have received at least one dose of a vaccine. Even assuming some overlap between the previously infected and the vaccinated, perhaps 100 to 120 million Americans have some level of immunity. That’s roughly one-third of the population.It could take months for the size of this group to reach a point where the number of COVID-19 deaths a day falls below 100. Until then, we’ll be confronted with a different sort of risk: that, for some, the pandemic feels like it’s over long before it actually is. Just as the country has never taken a unified approach to battling COVID-19, we may very well end up without a unified approach to deciding when it ends. That’s why public-health experts are desperately urging Americans to hold firm even as the pandemic seems to be receding. “We’re lifting mitigation measures too soon,” warned Gounder, the infectious-disease specialist at NYU. “We’re taking our foot off the brake before putting the car into park.” If enough people ignore that message and decide the pandemic is over for them, it may very well put off the moment when we can say that the pandemic is over for everyone.The Atlantic’s COVID-19 coverage is supported by grants from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.About the AuthorAlexis Madrigal is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and the host of KQED’s Forum.More StoriesGetting Back to Normal Is Only Possible Until You Test PositiveThe Messiest Phase of the Pandemic Yet7 similarities between T&T's 1918 flu pandemic and COVID-19 | Loop Trinidad & Tobago LoginTrinidad & Tobago Jamaica Barbados Cayman Islands Haiti St. Lucia Caribbean NewsLoopTT MenuNewsVideosT&T NewsCrimeEnvironmentPoliticsWorld NewsCaribbean NewsFestivalsEntertainmentCarnivalLifestyleTravelFoodBusinessEnergySportCPLMatch CentreLoop NoticiasMonday Nov 11 0°CNews (current)VideosTopicsLoopTT MenuNewsVideosT&T NewsCrimeEnvironmentPoliticsWorld NewsCaribbean NewsFestivalsEntertainmentCarnivalLifestyleTravelFoodBusinessEnergySportCPLMatch CentreLoop NoticiasLocationTrinidad & TobagoJamaicaBarbadosCayman IslandsHaitiSt. LuciaCaribbean NewsMy LoopSign InForgot Password?Create AccountBreaking News TSC stakeholder engagement planned for 2025Teen dies nearly two weeks after accidentMan left in critical condition after drive-by shooting in NewtownCops need help identifying body found in Sangre GrandeLaventille man gunned down, 20 spent shells recoveredMan shot dead in Rio Claro attempting to leave bar'Venom: The Last Dance' tops box office againActor Tony Todd, known for his role in the movie Candyman, dies at 69Man washing van runs to escape bulletsSiparia bar fight ends in choppingMonday Nov 11 0°C Lifestyle4 min read7 similarities between T&T's 1918 flu pandemic and COVID-19Loop News February 26, 2021 08:18 AM ETPhoto: Nurses during the 1918 influenza pandemic in Boston, Massachussetts. Photo via the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of our way of life in Trinidad and Tobago, even resulting in the cancellation of the country’s 2021 Carnival celebrations.However, the country has previously experienced a pandemic that led to numerous deaths - the 1918 influenza pandemic, also known as the 'Spanish Flu'.Here are seven things to know about Trinidad and Tobago’s 1918 influenza pandemic:1. Sick people were quarantinedSimilar to the current pandemic, those infected with influenza were quarantined at the Port of Spain General Hospital, formerly known as the Colonial Hospital. According to a post by the National Archives of Trinidad and Tobago, District Officers of Health declared influenza a quarantinable disease. According to reports, the number of reported deaths was 300 but the estimated total was closer to 1,000.2. Poor people suffered the mostAccording to ‘The Influenza Pandemic of 1918-1919 in the British Caribbean’ by David Killingray, the majority of those who succumbed to the virus were the poor and indigenous populations:‘Although all sections of the population were vulnerable, the heaviest mortality rates were among the very poor, East Indian immigrant labourers, and native Americans. There was also a high toll among males aged 15-40. Altogether the death rate from influenza in the British Caribbean was c.30,000.’3. Weather didn’t affect the spread of the virus, gatherings didAccording to Killingray, close proximity encouraged the spread of the virus:‘Close crowding of people offers ideal conditions for infection. In serious cases the symptoms are bloody sputum, bleeding from the nose, and lung failure associated with haemorrhagic and oedematic complications.’He also noted that those most at risk included the elderly, the very young, and those with respiratory complications.4. There was difficulty in gathering dataContact tracing methods have improved considerably since the 1918 pandemic. Killingray says:‘There are difficulties in assembling historical data on the geographical spread and incidence of influenza and its morbidity rates. In the early decades of this century health records were patchy, even in industrialized countries; for much of the world reliable data on individual causes of death rarely existed, and public health systems were limited.’Killingray added that in many cases where influenza was the cause of death, this was attributed to ‘symptoms such as pneumonia or “coughs and fever”’.He added that there were high mortality rates among indigenous populations.5. The virus arrived via travellersAs with the current pandemic, the 1918 flu pandemic was spread to Trinidad and Tobago via travellers. It’s reported that the virus appeared to have spread from North America via shipping routes. Killingray noted that another influenza epidemic from 1889-90 appeared in New Orleans in 1890 and before the end of the month, it was reported in Tobago.6. Trinidad and Tobago was less affected compared to other Caribbean territoriesThe report notes that Trinidad and Tobago may have had a less severe impact due to stringent quarantine measures and a slow-down in shipments:‘For example, in Trinidad and Tobago the Blue Book for 1918 reported that 'influenza of a mild type was widespread during the latter part of the year, but was not attended by the high mortality observed in other countries', including neighbouring Venezuela, while in Barbados in late December and early January influenza victims were reported to be numerous but the death rate low.’‘Such variations may have been due to prompt quarantine actions by the authorities, for example in the Bahamas, which although in close proximity to the United States must have been helped by a dearth of wartime shipping, and possibly also in Trinidad.’The report noted however that a government medical officer reported a ‘high mortality rate’. Although the virus was made a quarantinable disease, the Surgeon-General did not think it necessary to make it a notifiable disease.A third reason is that Trinidad and Tobago is no stranger to virulent and infectious diseases:‘The high profile epidemic diseases that frequently erupted in the Caribbean were most dangerously smallpox, typhoid, measles and yellow fever, while influenza in severe epidemic form was a sudden, short-lived and relatively infrequent visitor…On a day-to-day basis medical and government authorities in the Caribbean had their attention focused on those diseases that permanently and seriously affected life and the economic well-being of the islands.’7. The pandemic spurred improvements in the national healthcare systemThe report noted that as a result of the influenza pandemic, a focus was placed on proper nutrition and healthcare:‘The pandemic vividly highlighted for some the extent of malnutrition and poverty suffered by a large section of the population of the British Caribbean. Whether this helped to bring about an improvement in systems of public health is a matter for further enquiry.’Following the pandemic, suggestions were made to improve the general hygienic programme of the West Indies and highlighted the ‘paucity of medical services in the British Caribbean and the urgent need for adequate public health care to deal with widespread poverty which was perceived by many to be the main cause of communal disease’.Read more about the report here: https://bit.ly/3koHu3j Loop is better in the app. Customize your news feed, save articles for later, view your reading history and more.

With only two wings per chicken, it takes several chickens to make up the menu item. Kyochon F&B's popular "Red Original" chicken menu item / Courtesy of Kyochon F&BAlso, bigger chickens are used and the items are composed of certain cuts of meat instead of serving the whole bird. "As the avian influenza outbreak drags on, poultry farmers cannot wait until their chicken are fully grown, because they can get infected at any time. So they kill the birds when they reach a certain size and send the meat to processing companies," an official at one fried chicken franchise said. Genesis BBQ, another major fried chicken franchise, is also having problems supplying meat. Its employees are visiting chicken farms across the country in search of healthy birds. The company is said to have supplied about 98 percent of the chicken its franchisees need. "Apart from chicken farms that are under contract to supply us meat, we are looking for new farms. Even if we find one now, it will take a month for the chicken to grow," a Genesis BBQ official said. Prices of fried chicken sold at restaurants are expected to rise too.According to the Korea Broiler Council last Thursday, the price of a kilogram of chicken rose 16.2 percent to 3,308 won compared to three months ago.This is forcing fried chicken restaurant chains to consider raising prices even though they have set limits due to fears of a backlash from customers. "When the price surges to a certain point, the headquarters shoulders the burden and not the franchisees or customers. It is obvious that the price of chicken has increased, but we cannot increase our menu prices because customers will definitely oppose it," a Kyochon F&B official said. jhkim@koreatimes.co.kr More articles by this reporter Most Read in Business 1SK chief wins chance to challenge $986 mil. divorce settlement 2Lotte, Shinsegae in limelight after Trump win 3Korea kicks off largest-ever sales festival 4KT&G reports triple growth in global tobacco market 5French beef unlikely to win over Korean consumers Top 10 Stories 1Korea to launch economic consultative bodies to brace for Trump 2.0 2SK chief wins chance to challenge $986 mil. divorce settlement 3Concerns grow over AI textbooks as digital dependence increases among students 4Korean essay on 'ramyeon' to be published in UK 5Lotte, Shinsegae in limelight after Trump win 6Nobel laureate Han Kang to hear Korean introduction at award ceremony in Stockholm 7Putin finalizes N.

While the highly contagious strain H5N8 is lethal for birds it has never before been reported to have spread to humans.About Avian influenza (bird flu):It is a viral infection that can infect not only birds, but also humans and other animals. Most forms of the virus are restricted to birds.It is a highly contagious viral disease affecting several species of food-producing birds (chickens, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl, etc.), as well as pet birds and wild birds.Occasionally mammals, including humans, may contract avian influenza.Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on two surface proteins, Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA).Influenza A(H5N8) virus:According to Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health, H5N8 avian influenza is a disease of birds, caused by Type “A” influenza viruses, which can affect several species of domestic poultry, such as chickens, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl, ducks, as well as pet birds, wild migratory birds and water fowl.Can the virus transfer to humans?There are no known cases of H5N8 in human beings. Risk to general public is very low. There is also no evidence that consumption of poultry meat or eggs could transmit the virus to humans. But necessary precautions are required while handling sick/dead birds and contaminated material during control and containment operations. It is considered safe to eat properly cooked poultry products.Control measures:Culling is usually undertaken to control the infection when it is detected in animals. Besides culling, safe disposal of all such culled animals and animal products is also important. The authorities also need to strictly enforce decontamination of infected premises and undertake quarantine of contaminated vehicles and personnel.InstaLinks:Prelims Link:When a country is declared free from Avian Influenza, who declares it?H5N1 vs H5N6 vs H9N2 vs H5N8.Mains Link:Write a note on Bird Flu.

Share via email Share on Reddit Share on Linked In Russia has reported the first case of a bird flu strain, H5N8, being passed from poultry to humans. Photo: AFP Officials said seven workers at a poultry plant in the south of the country had been infected following an outbreak there in December. "All seven people... are now feeling well," said the head of Russia's consumer health watchdog, Anna Popova. She said that adequate measures had been quickly taken to stop the spread of infection. Other strains of bird flu occasionally infect humans and have led to deaths - but this is the first report of the H5N8 strain being passed on. There was no sign of transmission between humans, Popova said, adding that the case had been reported to the World Health Organization. She praised "the important scientific discovery" by Russia's Vektor laboratory, which had isolated the strain's genetic material from the infected workers. "The discovery of these mutations, when the virus has not still acquired an ability to transmit from human to human gives us all, the entire world, time to prepare for possible mutations and react in an adequate and timely fashion," Popova said. Russian scientists could now start working on developing test systems, she said. -BBC Tags: world Russia health Share this Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share via email Share on Reddit Share on Linked In Copyright © 2021, Radio New Zealand Subscribe to RNZ's Daily Newsletter View latest newsletter Next story in World How will NZ deal with children of terror suspect?
