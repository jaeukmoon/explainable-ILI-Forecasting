In this study, the evolution and pathogenicity of H6 AIVs isolated in live poultry markets from 2011 to 2017 were investigated. These H6 isolates were reassortant with other subtypes of influenza virus with increasing genomic diversity. However, no predominant genotype was found during this period. All of the H6N2 and most of the H6N6 isolates replicated efficiently in lungs of inoculated mice without prior adaptation. All of the H6N2 and two H6N6 isolates replicated efficiently in nasal turbinates of inoculated mice, which suggested the H6N2 viruses were more adaptive to the upper respiratory tract of mice than the H6N6 viruses. One of H6N2 virus caused systemic infection in one out of three inoculated mice, which indicated that H6 avian influenza virus, especially the H6N2 viruses posed a potential threat to mammals. Five H6 strains selected from different genotypes caused no clinical signs to inoculated chickens, and their replication were limited in chickens since the viruses have been detected only from a few tissues or swabs at low titers. Our study strongly suggests that the H6 avian influenza virus isolated from live poultry markets pose potential threat to mammals.

Influenza A viruses are subdivided into 18 different hemagglutinin (HA) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes based on the surface proteins1,2,3,4. Subtype H6 is one of the widespread AIV subtypes though it is easy to be neglected for its low pathogenicity in birds5,6,7.The H6 AIV was isolated first from a turkey in the United States in 19658,9. Since then, H6 AIVs have been detected frequently from wild aquatic birds and domestic poultry throughout the world10,11,12. During 2000–2002, H6N2 AIVs were isolated from chickens from 12 different locations in California. The pathological changes observed in the early cases were primarily associated with mild respiratory infections, but yolk peritonitis had become the main feature of all the subsequent cases through 2001 and 200213. In 2009, H6N1 AIV was isolated once again from turkey exhibiting typical signs associated with AIV infection in Israel14.Domestic ducks act as an important reservoir for influenza viruses and have also facilitated the establishment of multiple H6 influenza virus lineages15. Among those, the H6N2 and H6N6 were the main epidemiological subtypes recently circulated in Southern China6,7,15,16. Though clinical disease caused by H6 in chicken farms has not been reported in China, H6 AIVs were isolated continually from chickens in the live poultry markets (LPMs) and might pose a huge threat on the poultry industry. Previous studies have shown that the H6 AIVs have a broad host range, and the H6 viruses might have crossed the species barrier and infected mammals, including humans, without adaptation17,18. In 2010, an avian-origin H6N6 swine influenza virus was isolated from sick pigs in Southern China19. Three years later, an H6N1 virus was isolated from a woman with flu-like symptoms in Taiwan18. In addition, an H6N1 virus with molecular characteristics closely related to the human isolates, was found to cause infections in dogs20. H6 AIVs have the potential to cross the species barrier and infect mammals, including humans18,20. Around 34% of H6 viruses isolated from Southern China could bind to the human-like receptor17. Specially, a single amino acid change from glutamine to leucine at position 226 of hemagglutinin causes a switch in receptor-binding preference from avian-like to mammalian-like21. In addition, H6 AIVs provided internal genes for other subtype viruses and generated novel viruses frequently, such as H5N1, H9N2 and H5N6 AIVs which were detected in humans22,23,24.Recently, a large amount of H6 AIVs were isolated in Southern China through routine surveillance and their phylogenetic characters were analyzed comprehensively25. However, the pathogenicity of those H6 AIVs on chickens and mammals are unclear. In this study, the evolution and pathogenicity of 7 H6N2 and 15 H6N6 viruses, isolated from LPMs in Southern China from 2011 to 2017, were evaluated in mice and chickens.Materials and methodsVirus isolationOropharyngeal swabs were collected at different LPMs in Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Fujian provinces from 2011 to 2017. Each swab was soaked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and tested by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using influenza-specific HA primers for H6 subtype as described previously26,27. To isolate the viruses, the H6-positive samples were filtered through 0.22 μm filters and inoculated into allantoic cavity of 9-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (Beijing Merial Vital Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd.,Beijing, China). The viruses were purified and propagated by 3 rounds of limiting dilution in embryonated SPF chicken eggs28. The viral titers were determined in SPF embryonated chicken eggs and calculated using the Reed and Muench method29.Genetic analysis and phylogenetic analysisViral RNAs were extracted from allantoic fluid containing H6 viruses with the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Gemany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized using reverse transcriptase M-MLV (Takara Bio Inc., Dalian, China) with universal primer for influenza A viruses (5`- AGC RAA AGC AGG-3`) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The eight gene segments of each virus were amplified by PCR with universal primers for influenza30. The PCR were carried out in an C1000 Thermal cycler PCR Instrument (Biorad, U.S.A.) using Premix Ex Taq version 2.0 (Takara Bio Inc., Da Lian, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR products were purified using DNA Gel Extraction Kits (Axygen, Hangzhou, China) and sequenced by GENEWIZ Biotechnology Company (Suzhou, China). The sequences were edited with Seqman module of the DNAStar package. Phylogenetic trees were generated by the distance-based neighbor-joining method using Clustal W. The reliability of the trees was assessed by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replications31. Reference sequences were cited from GenBank of NCBI and GISAID.Studies with miceTo determine the pathogenicity of theH6 AIVs in mice, each of eight 4-week-old female BALB/c mice (Beijing Merial Vital Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) were anesthetized and inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with 106.0 EID50 in 30.0 μl PBS of each virus of the 22 H6 isolates. Eight control mice were inoculated intranasally with 30.0 μl of PBS. At five days post-inoculation (dpi), three mice in each group were euthanized, and their lungs, nasal turbinates, hearts, livers, spleens and brains were collected for virus titration. Each organ was homogenized in chilled PBS and centrifuged at 2500g for 10 min. The viruses in the supernatants were titrated using the methods described previously29. The body weight and clinical signs of remaining five mice in each group were recorded until 14 dpi.Studies with chickensThe pathogenicity of 5 H6 viruses from different genotypes, was evaluated in SFP chickens. Each of six 4-week-old SPF chickens were inoculated i.n. with 106.0EID50/bird of each virus in a volume of 100.0 μl, respectively. One day later, three naïve chickens were introduced into each of these isolates to evaluate the transmission of viruses among chickens. Six control birds were inoculated i.n. with the same amount of PBS. Three inoculated chickens in each group were euthanized, and their tracheas, lungs, kidneys, spleens and duodenums were collected for virus isolation at 3 dpi. Cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from the other 3 chickens at 2, 4 and 6 dpi. All of the tissues were homogenized in PBS (0.1 g per 1.0 ml), and the swabs in 1.0 ml PBS were stirred on vortex, and then all samples were centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 min. Each supernatant was collected, filtered through 0.22 μm filters, and inoculated into allantoic cavities of three 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. At 14dpi, blood samples were drawn from the remaining inoculated chickens and three contact chickens for detection of H6 subtype specific antibodies.Ethics statement and statistical analysisAll animal studies in this study were conducted in accordance to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute, and all animal studies protocols are approved by Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute (Permit number: SHVRI-Po-0120). Good living environment with sufficient food and water were available for all the animals. Comparisons of the weight changes between two groups were determined by nonparametric t-tests using GraphPad (Vision 6.0, GraphPad Prism). The differences were considered statistically significant if P values < 0.05(*), P < 0.01(**), P < 0.001(***).ResultsVirus isolation and identificationA total of 22 H6 AIVs were isolated from ducks and geese without any obvious clinical signs in LPMs during 2010–2017. All of viruses were propagated in SPF chicken embryonated eggs and their virus titers ranged from 106.3 to 109.5 EID50/100 μl. Full genomes of 7 H6N2 and 15 H6N6 viruses were sequenced and deposited to the NCBI database, the accession number and abbreviations of viruses used in this study have been listed in Table 1.Table 1 Abbreviations used and GenBank accession numbers for H6 Avian Influenza virus isolates.Full size tableMolecular characterizationAccording to sequence analysis, all of the H6 isolates shared the same amino acids (PQIETR/GLF) with single basic amino acid at the cleavage site between HA1 and HA2, which displayed a low pathogenic feature32. The receptor-binding sites in HA protein possessed the amino acid residues Q226 and G228 (H3 HA numbering33, which is used throughout the manuscript), suggesting that all H6 isolates would have a higher affinity to α-2,3-linked sialic acid which is predominant in the upper respiratory tract of avian species34. Several mutations were found in the receptor-binding area in the HA proteins and listed in Table 2, including the amino acids from 169 to 171 which related to a potential glycosylation site, and the amino acid at 190 which was found to determine the binding capability of H9N2 viruses to lung epithelial cells of mouse and human35. The amino acid changes of A138S and P186T/I were appeared in ZJ/B1994/H6N6, FJ/D3480/H6N6and JS/F336/H6N6.Table 2 Molecular characteristics of H6 viruses.Full size tableThose 22 viruses contained 119E, 274H and 294 N on the NA proteins (N2 numbering36), which suggested that all viruses are sensitive to oseltamivir37. There were 11 amino acids deletion in the stalk region of three H6N6 isolates (ZJ/B1994/H6N6, FJ/D3480/H6N6 and JS/F336/H6N6), which might be associated with increased virulence in mammals38. It is notable that S31N substitutions in the M2 protein, which are associated with amantadine resistance of influenza virus were observed in GD/E3503/H6N2 and GD/F3891/H6N2 viruses39. Amino acid residues were E and D at positions 627 and 701 of the PB2 protein in all those H6 isolates, which have been associated with the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses in mammals40. Previous reports showed that the substitution D92E in the NS1 protein associated with reducing its phosphorylation and increasing the virus resistance to interferon41, but this substitution was not detected in any of the isolates. In addition, no amino acid changes associated with increased virulence in mammals were detected in the PA or PB1 proteins.Phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA genesThe nucleotide and amino acid similarity of the HA from 22 isolates in this study were 82.0% to 99.9% and 84.0% to 99.8%, respectively, as shown in Table 3. The phylogenetic tree of HA gene (Fig. 1a) indicated that all of the H6 isolates were divided into two clades under Eurasian lineage. All the H6N2 isolates were clustered in A/duck/Shantou/339/2000(H6N2)-like (ST/339-like) virus clade except GD/F1473/H6N2. Together with all of the H6N6 viruses, GD/F1473/H6N2 was derived from A/wild duck/Shantou/2853/2003(H6N2)-like (ST/2853-like) virus clade. Additionally, 3 H6N6 strains (ZJ/B1994/H6N6, FJ/D3480/H6N6 and JS/F336/H6N6) belonged to A/swine/Guangdong/K6/2010(H6N6)-like (GD/K6-like) subclade.Table 3 Nucleotide and amino acid identity of the HA genes among the twenty-two H6 subtype isolates from Southern China, 2011–2017.Full size tableFigure 1Phylogenetic trees of H6 AIVs isolated from 2011 to 2017 in Southern China. The phylogenetic trees of the H6 HA (a), N2 NA (b) and N6 NA (c) genes were generated by using the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 6.0. The genomic sequences of the viruses listed in black were downloaded from available databases; the viruses listed in red were evaluated in this study. The scale bar represents the distance between sequence pairs, and horizontal distances are proportional to genetic distance.Full size imageThe NA genes of 7 H6N2 isolates separated into two clades (ST/339-like and ST/2853-like clades). Only GD/F1473 clustered in the ST/2853-like clade, in which H3N2, H4N2, and H6N2 viruses were clustered. The other H6N2 viruses fell into ST/339-likeclade, in which the viruses were isolated from ducks, geese and chickens (Fig. 1b). The NA genes of 15 H6N6 isolates were divided into two clades as well. The majority of those viruses were clustered together with the clade of ST/192-like viruses. Only the JS/E1201/H6N6 strain clustered on the clade of A/Muscovy duck/Fujian/FZ01/2008(H5N6)-like (FJ/FZ01-like) virus (Fig. 1c).Phylogenetic analysis of the internal genesPhylogenetic analysis of the six internal genes showed that all those 22 H6 AIVs clustered in the Eurasian lineage. The PB1, PB2, PA and NS genes were divided into two clades, and the NP and M genes were fell into 3 clades (Fig. S1-6). Phylogenetic tree of PB1 genes showed that nine isolates were clustered in the ST339-like clade, in which the viruses were isolated from different birds including chicken, duck, goose and wild bird. The other thirteen isolates were closely related to A/duck/Guangdong/S3180/2010(H6N6) (GD/S3180) (Fig. S1). In the phylogenetic trees of the PB2 and NS genes, only GD/F1473/H6N2 located in a separated clade (Fig. S2 and S6). PB2 gene of GD/F1473/H6N2 was related closely to that of the early H5N1 AIV isolate A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 in the BJ/BJ/1/94-likeclade. The NS gene of GD/F1473/H6N2 was closely related to that of H3N2, H3N8, and H6N2 AIVs isolated from different waterfowls. As for the PA genes, all of the H6N6 viruses and one H6N2 virus GD/F1473/H6N2 were clustered in the ST339-like clade (Fig. S3). The other 5H6N2 viruses were located in the Gs/GD196-like clade. The NP gene of the virus JS/E1201/H6N6 was clustered in a separated A/duck/Hunan/573/2002(H6N2)-like (HN/573-like) clade, while other isolates were divided into ST339-likeand A/duck/Mongolia/54/2001(H5N2)-like (Mongolia/54-like) virus groups (Fig. S4). On the NP tree, most of the H6N6 and GD/F1473/H6N2were related to a H5N2 virus A/duck/Mongolia/54/2001. In the ST339-like clade, the NP genes of 6H6N2 isolates clustered into a A/chicken/Guangdong/C273/2011 related sub-group, while 3 H6N6 viruses clustered into the A/swine/Guangdong/K6/2010 related sub-group. In the phylogenetic tree of M gene, all the viruses were distributed in ST/339-like, China/G1291-like and ST/2853-like clades (Fig. S5). The M genes of 6 H6N2 viruses located in China/G1291-like, 3 H6N6 viruses located in ST/2853-like clade, and the most of H6N6 viruses clustered together with a H6N2 isolate GD/F1473/H6N2 on ST/339-like clade.According to the phylogenetic analysis of the whole genomes of the AIVs isolated from 2011 to 2017, the genotypes of H6 viruses were classified. Based on the HA genes, the viruses were divided into A and B genotypes corresponding to ST/339-like and ST/2853-like clades. H6N2 and H6N6 viruses were divided into A2, B2, A6 and B6 accordingly. Based on the different clades of NA and other 6 internal genes, the genotypes were named according to the chronological order of virus isolation in this study (Fig. 2). The genetic reassortment of H6 AIVs occurred frequently from 2011 to 2017, and resulted in multiple genotypes. The genotype of B602 was detected in 2012, 2015 and 2017, suggesting that the viruses of this genotype have elevated adaptation and replication efficiency in their natural reservoirs.Figure 2Genotypes of H6 AIVs isolated from 2011 to 2017 in Southern China. The genotypes of H6 influenza viruses were determined by the clades of each of their gene segments on the phylogenetic trees.Full size imagePathogenicity in miceTo evaluate the pathogenicity in mice, groups of white mice were inoculated i.n. with each H6 isolates (106.0 EID50/mice). All of the mice used for observation survived till 14 dpi. None of H6N2 viruses, except GD/1268/H6N2, caused significant body weight loss (P < 0.05) in mice compared with the control group (Fig. 3). As for H6N6 viruses, only HN/A729/H6N6 and ZJ/B1994/H6N6 caused significant growth retard in mice, while the clinical signs caused by other viruses were not obvious.Figure 3Bodyweight changes of BALB/c mice infected with the H6 AIVs. 4-week-old female BALB/c mice were inoculated i.n. with 106.0EID50 of virus in a volume of 30.0 μl. The body weight of 5 mice were measured daily until 14 dpi. Weight changes of the BALB/c mice infected with H6N2 (Fig. 3a) and H6N6 (Fig. 3b) were shown respectively. The data were graphed using the Prism 6.0 software (Vision 6.0, GraphPad Prism). Comparisons of the weight changes between two groups were determined by nonparametric t-tests using GraphPad. (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).Full size imageAll of the H6H2 isolates were able to replicate efficiently in mouse lung and nasal turbinate without prior adaptation. The mean virus titers were ranged from 103.4 to 106.0 EID50/ml in the lungs and from 101.8 to104.8 EID50/ml in the nasal turbinates (Table 4). Six out of seven H6N2 isolates were detectable in the heart of partial or all the three inoculated mice. Specially, two H6N2 viruses were found in the spleen of one out of three inoculated mice, and one of those viruses GD/E3503/H6N2 caused systemic infection in one inoculated mouse. In addition, the virus was recovered from liver and brain. The GD/1268/H6N2 and GD/1127/H6N2 viruses of A201 genotype were detectable in the lungs, nasal turbinates and hearts consistently, while the 4 isolates of A202 genotype showed diversity in the tissue tropisms (Table 4).Table 4 Replication of H6 viruses in mice.Full size tableThe H6N6 viruses, except ZJ/B2039/H6N6 and JS/G91/H6N6, replicated in the lungs of inoculated mice. ZJ/B2039/H6N6 has not been detected in any of the other tested tissues, and lower titers of JS/G91/H6N6 were detected only in the nasal turbinate of one out of three mice (Table 4), suggesting the limited replication of those 2 viruses in mice. In addition, the replication of GD/E3798/H6N6 was also limited in mice and lower virus titers were detected in the lungs and nasal turbinates from two out of three mice. Besides those 3 viruses, the other H6N6 isolates replicated well in the lungs and the virus titers ranged from 102.1 to 106.3 EID50/ml. Specially, the average virus titers of 5 isolates reached a high level of over 105.0 EID50/ml, which suggested those viruses replicated efficiently in the lungs of inoculated mice. In the nasal turbinates, only GD/E3415/H6N6 and FJ/D3480/H6N6 could be detected in all of the three mice, and the average virus titers were 101.1 and 102.5 EID50/ml, respectively. Except ZJ/B2039/H6N6 and ZJ/B2044/H6N6 which were not recovered from the nasal turbinates of all three mice, the remaining H6N6 viruses were detected in some inoculated mice. All of the H6N6 isolates were detectable in the hearts of some to all of the three inoculated mice, except ZJ/B2039/H6N6, GD/E3798/H6N6 and JS/G91/H6N6. Lower viral titers of some H6N6 viruses were detected in livers, spleens and brains in some inoculated mice, suggesting that those viruses replicate in mice (Table 4).Pathogenicity and transmission in chickensTo evaluate the virulence of the H6 isolates in chickens, groups of six 4-week-old SPF chickens were inoculated intranasally with 106.0 EID50 of each H6 isolate. No clinical sign was observed in the inoculated chickens. We further examined the replication of the H6 viruses by detecting the viruses in different tissue and swabs of inoculated chickens. The GD/1127/H6N2 and GD/E3503/H6N2 viruses were detected in the trachea of one inoculated chicken, respectively. FJ/D3480/H6N6 was detected in the duodenum of one inoculated chicken, while HN/A729/H6N6 and ZJ/B2028/H6N6 were not detected in any tested tissues of 3 inoculated chickens at 3dpi. Only GD/E3503/H6N2 was detected in the oropharyngeal swab from one chicken at 4 dpi. GD/E3503/H6N2 and HN/A729/H6N6 were detected in the cloacal swab from one chicken at 2 dpi and 6 dpi, respectively. None of 3 chickens inoculated with HN/A729/H6N6 showed seropositive to specific H6 antibody, and only some chickens inoculated with the other four viruses were seroconverted. One contact chicken in the GD/E3503/H6N2 group was seroconverted at 14 dpi, while no specific H6 antibody was detected in other contact chickens (Table 5). The results suggested the replication and transmission of H6 viruses with different genotypes were limited in chickens.Table 5 Replication of the H6 viruses in chickens.Full size tableDiscussionSince the late 1990s, H6 AIVs have been circulating in Southern China. The H6 viruses have been become more prevalent over time with an increasing isolation rate of H6N1, H6N2 and H6N6 subtypes6,15,42. In this study, we analyzed the molecular evolution and pathogenicity in mice and chickens of H6 AIVs isolated from the LPMs in Southern China from 2011 to 2017, and provided a glimpse of the genetic diversity and pathogenicity of H6 AIVs in mammals and chickens.Multiple H6 virus genotypes emerged from 2011 to 2017 resulted from the internal gene reassortment between H6 and other subtype viruses. It has been noted that most of the H6N1/N2 viruses isolated from Southern China from 2000 to 2005 were clustered with the G1-like, W312-like or H9N2 Ck/Bei-like lineage based on the PB2 and PB1 genes, and the PA and NP genes of most H6 viruses clustered with H5 and H9 viruses, M and NS genes with G1-like or H9N2 Ck/Bei-like lineage viruses16,22. Previous studies showed that the H6 isolate from ducks replicated poorly in chicken trachea and that the viruses recovered were W312-like viruses43,44. However, in our study, none of the internal genes were related closely to G1-like or W312-like viruses. These results suggested that the H6 subtype viruses in Southern China were genetically diverse, which might increase the potential for H6 viruses to transmit from ducks to other animals.Molecular analyses suggested that all of the 22 H6 isolates were low pathogenic AIVs. The receptor-binding sites in the viral HA proteins possess the residues Q226 and G228, similar to those H6 isolates reported previously, which preferentially bind to the α-2,3-linked sialic acid receptors predominant in avian species45,46. However, the E190V and N192D substitutions of H6 HA have been associated with interspecies transmission of AIVs from ducks to chickens47, but those amino acids were not found in the five H6 AIVs (GD/1127/H6N2, GD/E3503/H6N2, HN/A729/H6N6, ZJ/B2028/H6N6 and FJ/D3480/H6N6) in this study, which would be the most likely reason that the replication of the H6 isolates in chickens was surprisingly limited. The residues 228S, 137N, 186L, A13S, and A193N at HA associated with human receptor-binding preference45,47 were not found in H6 isolates in this study. Additionally, almost all H6N6 isolates have the substitution of HA at V187D, the binding affinity might be altered to adapt to mammalian receptors19.None of E119V, H275Y, R293K and N295S substitution in the NA were found, which suggested those H6 isolates are sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir. The deletion of 11 amino acids in the stalk region of the NA of FJ/D3480/H6N6, ZJ/B1994/H6N6and JS/F336/H6N6, which was also found in a swine H6N6 virus, might be associated with the infectivity of H6N6 viruses in mammals through affecting NA activity48 and the balance between HA and NA49. It is notable that the S31N substitution in the M2 protein, which is associated with amantadine resistance of influenza virus50, was found in GD/E3503/H6N2 and GD/F3891/H6N2.Some of the H6 viruses replicated efficiently on MDCK and A549 cells and in the lungs of mice17,51. The direct contact transmission of H6 viruses in guinea pigs was confirmed previously, which suggested the H6 viruses pose a clear threat to mammals17. We found that all of the H6H2 isolates were able to replicate efficiently in lung and nasal turbinate without prior adaptation in mice, but the replication ability of H6N6 varies. Even with the same genotype, different H6N6 viruses showed distinct replication abilities in mice, suggesting some amino acid mutations affected the replication of the viruses. Lower titers of some H6 viruses were detected in livers, spleens and brains in a part of inoculated mice, which suggested those viruses posed a potential to adapt and caused a systemic infection in mammals.Five H6 AIVs selected from different genotypes caused no clinical signs in any of the inoculated chickens. The replication and transmission of H6N2 and H6N6 viruses were limited in SFP chicken in this study, although the pathological changes caused by H6N2 in chickens were reported in California13. Previous study showed that H6N2 isolates caused seroconversion in infected chickens, but no virus was recovered from the tissue samples, which suggested that the H6N2 strains replicated poorly and were nonpathogenic to chickens52. Our findings showed that the five H6 strains selected from different genotypes caused no clinical signs in any of the inoculated chickens, but the serological test results suggested that chickens in four groups have been infected despite limited recovery of inoculated viruses from the tissue samples. The replication and transmission of H6N2 and H6N6 viruses were limited in SFP chicken in this study.Overall, our study suggested that the H6 AIVs circulating in South China are genetically diverse and pose potential threat to mammals, and continual surveillance of H6 viruses is necessary in China.

However, it is likely that most of your patients who have not yet received an influenza vaccination for the current flu season simply have not made the time to do so. But there is another group of patients who seem to have a ready set of explanations for why they ought to skip vaccination each flu season. Here are the rationales these patients might offer up and how you can respond.

Protecting your future as a physician. Join the AMA Today I’m healthy, so I don’t need a flu vaccine I’m healthy, so I don’t need a flu vaccine It is true that certain groups of patients—those who are pregnant, young children, seniors and patients with chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or asthma—are at higher risk of severe complications from flu infection. But the flu is a contagious disease that can lead to other serious illnesses, such as pneumonia.“Any flu infection can carry a risk of serious complications, hospitalization or death, even among otherwise healthy children and adults,” notes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes. “Therefore, getting vaccinated is a safer choice than risking illness to obtain immune protection.”Explore nine questions your patients may have about the flu vaccine. The flu vaccine isn’t safe and can give me the flu The flu vaccine isn’t safe and can give me the flu Flu vaccines are safe, as shown by more than 50 years of research and experience among hundreds of millions of Americans who have been immunized against influenza. There are some common side effects, such as swelling or redness from the shot, muscle aches, fever and nausea. But those should not be mistaken for influenza, which sends between 140,000 and 810,000 Americans to the hospital annually since 2010, according to the CDC.Flu vaccines cannot cause flu illness. Flu vaccines given with a needle (i.e., flu shots) are made with either inactivated (killed) viruses, or with only a single protein from the flu virus. The nasal spray vaccine contains live viruses that are attenuated, or weakened, so that they will not cause illness. However, you may still catch a non-flu virus. Non-flu cold viruses cannot be prevented by an influenza vaccine. And since it takes two weeks for the protective effects of the flu vaccination to kick in, you can still catch the flu during that time period.Learn more from the AMA about eight things doctors wish patients knew about flu shots. Related Coverage Flu vaccination: 6 tips to win over the undecideds It is better to get sick with the flu It is better to get sick with the flu “No,” the CDC warns. Anyone can get sick with the flu and experience serious complications. Though the U.S. death toll from influenza varies from year to year, the CDC estimates between 12,000 and 61,000 deaths annually since 2010.Even if your illness is relatively mild and brief, others may not be so lucky and you can spread the flu to them. That is especially concerning because some patients catch the flu but show no symptoms. Not knowing they have the flu, they are not as careful as they would otherwise be in protecting family, friends, neighbors and co-workers from potential exposure.“Getting a flu vaccine during 2020–2021 is more important than ever because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” the CDC says. “Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk from flu; many of whom are also at high risk for COVID-19 or serious outcomes.”Discover the six ways physicians can do boost flu vaccination among children. I’ll wait until flu hits my area I’ll wait until flu hits my area As mentioned above, it takes two weeks after flu vaccination for your body to develop the antibodies that protect you against influenza. Because of that, trying to time your vaccination to when the flu starts to circulate in your community is no simple task.It is important to note, though, that if you have not been vaccinated by the end of November, it can still be protective to get the flu vaccine. This is because the flu is unpredictable and has varying seasons, typically peaking between December and March, but occurring as late as May, says the CDC.Follow these six tips to win over the undecideds for flu vaccination.

The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether on-site testing and antiviral treatment of influenza in residents of homeless shelters reduces influenza spread in these settings.Methods and analysisThis study is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial of on-site testing and antiviral treatment for influenza in nine homeless shelter sites within the Seattle metropolitan area. Participants with acute respiratory illness (ARI), defined as two or more respiratory symptoms or new or worsening cough with onset in the prior 7 days, are eligible to enroll. Approximately 3200 individuals are estimated to participate from October to May across two influenza seasons. All sites will start enrollment in the control arm at the beginning of each season, with routine surveillance for ARI. Sites will be randomized at different timepoints to enter the intervention arm, with implementation of a test-and-treat strategy for individuals with two or fewer days of symptoms. Eligible individuals will be tested on-site with a point-of-care influenza test. If the influenza test is positive and symptom onset is within 48 h, participants will be administered antiviral treatment with baloxavir or oseltamivir depending upon age and comorbidities. Participants will complete a questionnaire on demographics and symptom duration and severity. The primary endpoint is the incidence of influenza in the intervention period compared to the control period, after adjusting for time trends.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04141917. Registered 28 October 2019. Trial sponsor: University of Washington. Peer Review reports IntroductionAnnual influenza epidemics are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, especially among individuals who are elderly, chronically ill, or pregnant [1]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that influenza has resulted in 140,000–810,000 hospitalizations and 12,000–61,000 deaths annually since 2010 [2].People experiencing homelessness as a high-risk groupAs of 2018, approximately 12,000 people in Seattle are experiencing homelessness of whom 48% are housed in a shelter [3]. Homeless individuals experience higher morbidity and mortality than the general population, in part due to untreated or poorly controlled chronic medical conditions, infections caused by lack of access to sanitation, and high rates of mental illness and substance abuse [4]. Individuals in shelters may be at heightened risk for acquisition and transmission of influenza due to overcrowding, inadequate ventilation, and shared hygiene facilities [5,6,7]. In this population, chronic conditions are less likely to be controlled, increasing the risk of severe infections [8]. The CDC recommends initiation of antiviral therapy in high-risk outpatients with suspected influenza [9]. Despite a significant proportion of the homeless population qualifying as high risk from chronic comorbidities, studies have shown that these individuals encounter significant barriers to accessing testing and treatment services for acute infections [10]. Data concerning transmission of influenza within homeless shelters remain limited as well, with some cross-sectional studies showing high prevalence of respiratory illnesses in shelters.Acute respiratory illness (ARI) burden in people experiencing homelessnessPast studies have described local outbreaks of influenza and other respiratory viruses in homeless shelters [11]. A cross-sectional investigation of respiratory virus prevalence conducted in French shelters detected at least one pathogen in 8.7% of participants [7]. In a study of adults hospitalized in an urban hospital in Seattle during a 5-year period, people experiencing homelessness accounted for one third of individuals diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) but were only 10% of the overall hospitalized population [12]. A New York-based study of three shelter clinics found that people experiencing homelessness had high rates of pneumonia and pneumonia-related death [6]. Another study found pneumonia or influenza-related mortality rates among a cohort of adults experiencing homelessness aged 25 to 44 ranged from 11.9–36.6 per 100,000 person years, a rate ratio of 1.6–6.3 when compared to the general population [13].Testing and antiviral therapy accessibilityEarly oseltamivir reduces duration of symptoms and lowers the risk of some complications among individuals with uncomplicated influenza [14,15,16]. Early oseltamivir treatment can also prevent secondary infections within households [17, 18].Baloxavir marboxil is a newly approved oral agent for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza that functions as a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, preventing influenza genome synthesis. It has similar clinical efficacy to oseltamivir but reduces viral load faster and is a single-dose regimen [19]. Therefore, baloxavir may have the potential for reducing person-to-person influenza virus transmission. Compliance with single dose baloxavir treatment of influenza is likely to be higher than a 5-day oseltamivir treatment course. Baloxavir is not approved for use in children under 12 years of age. However, oseltamivir is an approved option for the treatment of influenza in this age group.RationaleThere remain important unanswered questions regarding influenza burden and prevention of transmission in sheltered homeless populations. While prior studies have established that homeless populations are at high risk for tuberculosis, hepatitis A, and pneumonia, there are inadequate data regarding transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses [20]. It is also unknown how a single-dose treatment with an antiviral such as baloxavir will impact incidence throughout a season in a densely populated community space like a shelter. Neither on-site point-of-care testing for respiratory pathogens nor on-site pharmaceutical treatment has been evaluated as a method of infection prevention in homeless shelters. Studies show that rapid molecular influenza tests are very sensitive and specific, yet there is an unmet need to evaluate their usefulness in a low-resource high-density community setting [21].ObjectivesThe objective of the trial is to evaluate efficacy of on-site point-of-care rapid influenza molecular testing and rapid antiviral treatment with baloxavir or oseltamivir in influenza-positive individuals for decreasing influenza incidence within homeless shelters.Primary outcome measureThe primary outcome will be the incidence of influenza in shelters during the intervention period compared to the incidence during the control period, after adjusting for underlying time trends. It will be calculated as the number of cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza among shelter residents per person-day of observation (person-days of observation will be based on the aggregate weekly census at the shelter). The incidence during intervention periods will be compared to the incidence during non-intervention periods using generalized linear mixed models to control for clustering by shelter and temporal variation.Secondary outcome measures Adherence and resource utilization outcomes ○ Health resource utilization and school and work absenteeism among influenza cases○ Total number of person-tests per census-day at shelters○ Participant completion of administered study drug (only applicable to oseltamivir)○ Loss-to-follow-up after on-site influenza diagnosis Clinical outcomes ○ Symptom type, duration, and severity among influenza-positive cases○ Clinical, demographic, and behavioral factors associated with asymptomatic influenza-positive cases○ Relationship between symptom type, duration and severity, and seasonal influenza vaccination status○ Asymptomatic fraction, i.e., probability of laboratory-confirmed influenza without meeting illness criteria Laboratory outcomes ○ Semiquantitative viral load at day 0, day 2/3, and day 5/6/7○ Proportion of follow-up samples from influenza-positive cases with detectable influenza virus by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at days 2/3 and days 5/6/7○ Proportion of secondary influenza cases as identified via whole genome sequencing and sequence identity of 95%○ Emergence of antiviral resistance, assessed by whole genome sequencing of influenza viruses and detection of PA/I38X and non-PA/138 substitutions for baloxavir [22, 23] and H275Y and other NA mutations for oseltamivir [24].HypothesisOur primary hypothesis is that implementation of an on-site point-of-care rapid molecular influenza diagnostic test and antiviral treatment intervention for influenza among sheltered individuals experiencing homelessness will reduce the incidence of influenza within this population.Methods/designThe protocol for this study is in accordance with Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) [25]. A SPIRIT checklist is provided in Additional file 1.Seattle Flu Study designThe Seattle Flu Study (SFS) is a multi-year surveillance study for influenza in the Seattle-metro area [26]. This current protocol is a nested sub-study within SFS.Study designThe trial is being conducted in nine homeless shelters in the Seattle, WA metropolitan area. Shelters were selected within Washington’s King County to include a diverse population in terms of age, sex, and race that was reasonably representative of Seattle’s homeless population and had large enough nightly capacities that we would likely achieve statistical power for our proposed intervention. The nine shelters house different populations including men, women, or families, and have maximum nightly populations between 45 and 212 individuals each, with a total maximum nightly population estimated at 1032 individuals. The University of Washington is the sponsor of the trial.The trial is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized design clustered by homeless shelter (Fig. 1). The intervention is implementation of on-site point-of-care rapid molecular influenza testing and treatment with baloxavir or oseltamivir for all influenza-positive cases enrolling within 48 h of symptom onset (Fig. 2). Shelters will be randomized to begin the intervention at different months throughout the influenza season. We will conduct this trial over two influenza seasons with re-randomization of the timing of the intervention implementation each season. Individuals within shelters will be eligible to participate if they have two or more qualifying ARI symptoms (see Table 1 for symptom list). The control condition is an influenza-surveillance kiosk installed in a shelter that allows participants to collect a nasal swab that is then sent to a lab for testing. During the intervention period, symptomatic individuals with symptom onset in the prior 48 h who have not yet received antiviral influenza treatment will be eligible for on-site point-of-care rapid molecular influenza testing (Abbott Laboratories, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) at an “improved” kiosk. If individuals do not meet inclusion criteria because of symptom > 48 h duration, they are still eligible for surveillance testing. If intervention-eligible individuals test positive for influenza, they will be administered an antiviral (either baloxavir or oseltamivir based on eligibility criteria). All participants will receive active drug. We will perform whole genome sequencing of influenza-positive samples to evaluate secondary transmission within shelters. Fig. 1Stepped-wedge design for trial with theoretical influenza (flu) seasonsFull size imageFig. 2Trial schemaFull size imageTable 1 Acute respiratory illness (ARI) trigger symptoms of which participants should have ≥ 2 to be for eligible for enrollmentFull size tableAsymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic enrollment: Once a month, there will also be shelter-wide sampling of asymptomatic (i.e., no ARI trigger symptoms, see Table 1) and pauci-symptomatic individuals (i.e., one ARI trigger symptom, excluding new or worsening cough) to estimate the asymptomatic fraction. This will involve enrolling individuals who have been asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic for the prior 7 days. These individuals will not be eligible for the intervention. They will complete a brief survey and a nasal swab will be collected for on-site influenza testing. Seven days later, they will complete a follow-up survey sent via text message or email to assess for new onset of symptoms in the 7 days following the swab collection. If new symptoms have developed such that participants no longer meet the definition of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic, they will not be eligible for inclusion in the asymptomatic fraction.Study populationParticipants will be any individuals staying at participating shelters. Participants ≥ 12 years of age who test positive for influenza will be given baloxavir as treatment and receive a 7-day follow-up. Participants < 12 years of age and those with active malignancy, liver disease, or immunocompromising condition (see Table 2) who test positive for influenza will receive a 5-day course of oseltamivir. Table 2 Pre-existing conditions that necessitate use of oseltamivir instead of baloxavirFull size tableIndividual enrollment criteriaParticipants must fulfill all the following inclusion criteria: Resident for 1 or more days at a participating shelter 3 months of age or older New or worsening cough, or ≥ 2 ARI symptoms (see Table 1 for list) during past 7 days Willingness to take study medication Willingness to comply with all study procedures, including weekly surveillance and repeat nasal swab at day 2/3 and day 5/6/7 post-treatment. Ability to provide written, informed consent and/or assent Exclusion criteriaIndividuals meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded: Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration Inability to consent and/or comply with study protocol Receipt of oseltamivir or baloxavir within past 7 days for treatment of influenza Known hypersensitivity to baloxavir or oseltamivir Chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined as self-reported history of dialysis Enrollment criteria for sampling asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic residentsParticipants must fulfill all the following inclusion criteria: Resident for 1 or more days at a participating shelter 3 months of age or older No symptoms or 1 symptom (excluding new or worsening cough) from Table 1 in the prior 7 days Willing to comply with all study procedures, including a nasal swab on enrollment, repeat surveillance in 7 days and willingness to repeat nasal swab at day 7 if symptomatic. Able to provide written, informed consent and/or assent Sample size calculationsThe study aims to demonstrate a reduction in influenza incidence after implementation of on-site point-of-care rapid molecular testing for influenza and treatment with baloxavir or oseltamivir. Power calculations were based on an assumed 1.67% incidence rate per month, which was determined based on assumed 12% incidence rate during influenza season.Assuming nine shelters participating for two seasons each (18 shelter-seasons) and a mean of 200 participants per shelter, we estimate 86% power to detect a risk ratio of 0.50 at a 0.05 two-sided significance level (Additional file 2).Study proceduresRecruitment, screening, and consentIndividuals will be recruited from staffed kiosks at each site and screened for eligibility. Study staff will obtain informed consent from the individual or legal guardian (example form Additional file 3). Once the intervention has been introduced in a shelter, study staff will require the participant to consent to the testing and receipt of the treatment drug in addition to providing questionnaire responses and a nasal swab. To encourage participation, the study team’s presence on site will be advertised, and the study team will be on site at regular days and times. Participants will also be compensated for their time and participation with gift cards.Pre-intervention periodDuring the pre-intervention period, kiosks will screen and enroll individuals for the Seattle Flu Study [26]. Kiosks will be staffed at regular times 6 days a week at each shelter. Individuals with new or worsening cough or ≥ 2 ARI symptoms will be eligible for participation once every 7 days. Eligible individuals who choose to participate will have a mid-turbinate nasal swab (nylon flocked, COPAN FLOQSwab, Murrietta, CA, USA) collected and answer demographic and clinical questions on an electronic tablet using REDCap (Nashville, TN, USA). No on-site testing or treatment will be offered in the shelters during the control period. While not standard in shelters, testing kiosks were selected as the control condition for the pre-intervention period as they are the most efficient and unbiased means of discerning baseline influenza incidence through observational design in an uncontrolled environment within a population that has not sought clinical care for their illness episode.Intervention periodSites will be randomized by an algorithm produced by the study statistician to different starting months for the intervention. This will be concealed from sites until the week of implementation. All sites will remain in the intervention period for the remainder of the season once it has been introduced. Kiosks will continue to be staffed at regular times 6 days a week during the intervention period at each site. Individuals who meet inclusion criteria for the pre-intervention period can continue to enroll. For individuals with symptoms < 48 h, they will be eligible to enroll in the intervention arm. The intervention will include use of an on-site point-of-care rapid molecular influenza test (Abbott ID NOW, Abbott Laboratories, Lake Bluff, IL, USA) which produces a result in 12 min. Baloxavir (XOFLUZA, Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA) or oseltamivir (TAMIFLU, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) treatment will be administered for all influenza-positive individuals, with pertinent medication counseling provided on-site by kiosk staff. Study clinicians will be available 24/7 by phone to respond to questions or concerns that cannot be directly addressed by the kiosk staff. Influenza rapid test-positive individuals aged 3 months to 11 years, those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and adults with active malignancy, liver disease, or who are immunocompromised (Table 2) will receive a 5-day supply of oseltamivir (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). All other individuals with influenza-positive results on rapid testing will receive a one-time dose of baloxavir (Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA). No participants will receive placebo. Individuals who had symptom onset > 48 h before enrollment will be eligible only for routine lab-based testing, as was available during the pre-intervention period.Follow-upFollowing antiviral drug receipt, all participants in the intervention arm will be asked to return to the kiosk at their shelter for prospective questionnaire and nasal swab collection on day 2 or 3 and day 5, 6, or 7 after diagnosis (Table 3). Participants will be asked to return a final time on day 14 to report any further adverse events. Kiosk staff will recommend that the parents of all participants aged 3 months to 11 years who test positive for influenza take their child to see their primary care or urgent care provider within 24 to 72 h, depending on age and comorbidities. They will receive a referral letter for their provider and a travel voucher. Table 3 Timing of data collectionFull size tableConsidering the transient nature of this population, we will encourage follow-up through autogenerated text-message reminders for those with cell phones and through paper-based appointment slips provided by kiosk study staff at the time of enrollment.For those that provide consent for release of information, laboratory results will be released to their on-site providers for treatment follow-up.Asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic samplingOnce a month, all shelter residents with less than two ARI symptoms (excluding new or worsening cough) will be eligible to participate in the study through collection of a surveillance nasal swab tested via lab-based qRT-PCR and condensed questionnaire (Fig. 3). They will be asked to follow-up on day 7 after the initial swab for a repeat questionnaire. These questionnaires will be sent in autogenerated text messages or by email. If they have developed two or more ARI symptoms in the intervening 7 days, they will be asked for a repeat nasal swab and screened for enrollment into the symptomatic surveillance arm of the study. These specimens will be tested in the same manner as pre-intervention surveillance specimens from symptomatic participants. Fig. 3Asymptomatic enrollment schema for study participation November 2019–March 2020. Asymptomatic study participation was modified from a monthly activity to every day there was a research assistant on-site conducting study recruitment and enrollments at a shelterFull size imageBiospecimen managementNasal swabs will be placed in universal viral transport media (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin, NJ) and transported at room temperature to University of Washington, where they will be aliquoted in triplicate, barcoded using a unique identifier linked back to the participant and site of collection, and stored at 4 °C until testing. Residual samples will be stored at − 80 °C.Laboratory testingTotal nucleic acids will be extracted using the Magna Pure 96 kit (Roche). They will then be tested by TaqMan Open Array RT-PCR (Thermo) for 26 respiratory pathogens. Viral genome sequencing by hybrid capture will be attempted on all influenza-positive samples with viral loads > ~ 50,000 genomic copies/mL using a protocol described previously for the Seattle Flu Study [26].Data managementData security and privacyAll information from the study subjects will be kept confidential. All forms and specimens will have a participant identification number, given to the participant upon enrollment in the study. Data will be collected electronically in REDCap (Nashville, TN, USA). The REDCap survey app is Title 21 CFR Part 11 compliant, password protected, and an auditable database. The list linking the participant to the ID number will be stored separately from the REDCap database. Access to identifiable information will be limited to the study staff and the study pharmacists (for drug dispensing and delivery purposes). Any datasets that include identifiable information will be stored in a HIPAA-compliant manner via OneDrive for Business (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) at the University of Washington. No identifying information will be included on any data sent to the broader study team or any other data-sharing repositories.All subjects will also be asked to approve the storage of their biospecimens during the initial consenting process and prior to study participation. Persons who consent to the trial but who do not want their biospecimens stored may still participate. Their biospecimens will be tested per protocol, but remaining aliquots will be destroyed.Data qualityClinical research staff will check data for missing or unusual values and for consistency within participants and shelters in the centralized data capture system. Computerized checks will be conducted daily for any enrollments made to identify missing, inconsistent, or out of range data. Any suspect data will be raised as data queries.The study coordinator will investigate data queries to provide an explanation and possible resolution of discrepancies on a weekly basis using the data quality module overview on REDCap. The study coordinator will raise queries and share them with the study staff who are involved in the shelter enrollment process or are involved in data collection and management. The study staff will contact participants via their preferred method of communication (phone, in-person, or email) to clarify instances of suspect data. Following this communication, the data items will be marked as “verified,” and an additional review will be conducted by the study coordinator. The query will then be closed. When there are no longer any open queries on a survey, it can be locked by the study coordinator.A trial steering committee or data quality committee were not deemed necessary for the purposes of this trial since the nature of the RCT is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and population-level impact of an FDA-approved diagnostic tool and non-experimental, standardized antiviral treatment. Overview and accountability do not require the formulation of additional committees since the nature of the study design results in the majority of participant encounters being observational (only involving a one-time completion of the demographic questionnaire and nasal swab collection) and require no follow-up. Those that do meet the criteria for follow-up protocol adherence have a short follow-up period (7 days) and require their presence at the study site of initial enrollment when they received a positive rapid flu test result. Protocol adherence is thus manageable to evaluate through the tracking of expected follow-up study visits completed in this 1 week period by study coordinators with REDCap and research assistants’ physical presence 6 days per week at study sites.Similarly, study coordinators are easily able to check on shelters’ recruitment progress through regular REDCap database checks, weekly calls with on-site research assistants conducting enrollments, consistent email correspondence with shelter management, and regular visits to study shelter sites. Staff training is facilitated by coordinators following content review and approval by the study’s primary investigator and co-investigators that hold medical licenses. Post-tests, refresher trainings, and on-site job checks are also conducted by coordinators with all research assistants following trainings to ensure their ability to safely and knowledgeably adhere to study protocols.Plan for reporting unanticipated problems/adverse eventsOn day 2 or 3 and day 5, 6, or 7 following receipt of the study drug, participants will be asked to provide additional nasal swab specimens tested at University of Washington via qRT-PCR and symptom logs. In addition, they will complete questionnaires pertaining to short-term reactions to the study drug that may fit the definition of an adverse event (AE). Any common treatment side effects experienced by the participant, which will have been explained by study staff during the drug counseling process, will be noted in these questionnaires during the follow-up period alongside notes regarding relevant symptoms and their severity. A questionnaire to make a final assessment of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be administered on day 14. There are no expected adverse events from the antiviral treatments provided in the intervention that are specific to this population. Both oseltamivir and baloxavir are considered standard-of-care medications for influenza and are well tolerated by most patients.Reported adverse events will be reviewed to determine the relationship to drug treatment and whether it was unexpected. If the event is possibly related to the study, a report will be made to the independent safety officer, who will make a determination. All SAEs will be reported to the data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) regardless of cause. Only events that meet the definition of an SAE will be reported in trial publications.Protections against risksTo reduce distress, participants may skip any questions they are uncomfortable answering. Additionally, all participants will be reminded that involvement in research is always optional, and they may terminate their participation at any time without consequences. Neither shelter staff nor the study funder will have access to an individual participant’s data or test results. If the trial intervention proves effective, there is no current plan to continue access to on-site testing and treatment after the trial ends.Real-time resultsSubjects undergoing influenza point-of-care testing will be immediately notified of their influenza status. All participants, regardless of intervention status at their shelter of residence, will be able to access additional testing results from the study lab on an online platform within 1 month of enrollment. Reported pathogens may include influenza viruses and/or RSV. An access code or URL to view results will be provided by kiosk staff to the participant at the end of their study encounter.Future useSamples will be stored at the University of Washington for future testing.Deidentified aggregate data will be available to the public on www.seattleflu.org, as will statistical code.End of trialThe end of trial is defined as when the last individual has had their last data collected following two subsequent influenza seasons; active participant enrollment will take place over the course of 2 years between October 2019 and is projected to end in May 2021.Statistical analysesAnalyses will be intention-to-treat (ITT), consisting of all individuals who have consented to receive an antiviral or who would have been eligible to receive an antiviral had they tested positive or been in the intervention group. Analyses will be based on complete cases. Flu-positive participants who do not complete all follow-up surveys will be treated as uniformly censored as of their most recent valid nasal swab result and will be excluded.The primary endpoint is as follows: incidence of influenza virus infection will be analyzed using a generalized linear model following a Poisson distribution with a log link and robust variance adjusted for calendar time with an offset of shelter person-days and random effect for shelter. Additional shelter-level covariates (i.e., adult vs. family shelter) may be included in the model to increase precision. This model will be used to estimate/summarize incidence density, a function of number of cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases among shelter residents divided by total person-days of all individuals staying at the shelter. Study arms will be compared using a two-tailed Wald test. Time-averaged estimated intervention effect, 95% confidence intervals, and p values will be calculated.For the secondary endpoints of symptom duration and symptom severity, we will use generalized linear mixed effects regression models with logit link functions, adjusted for individual-level variables and time points. Duration will be based on the outcome of influenza viral detection 1 week after diagnosis (yeso). Severity will be dichotomized into severe or not severe based on the symptom severity 3-point Likert scale in questionnaire results.For the secondary endpoint of asymptomatic fraction, we will calculate this as the number of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic participants with confirmed asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic status on follow-up divided by the number of eligible participants enrolled on the day of sampling.Interim analysisThe primary outcome data will not be analyzed at an interim point, but the secondary outcome data regarding emergence of antiviral resistance in participants who received either baloxavir or oseltamivir will be reviewed at the end of the first year’s influenza season. If observed emerging antiviral resistance exceeds 20%, we will cease participant enrollment in this clinical trial.Health resource utilization analysisThe resource utilization analysis will include a “within-trial” cost-effectiveness analysis to compare the costs and the number of missed school or work days accrued over the follow-up period for shelters and individuals in the intervention and control periods attributed to influenza virus infection. Results will be presented as a ratio of the incremental cost per day of school or work missed with point-of-care testing and treatment compared with routine lab-based testing without on-site treatment.Translational analysisSamples will be sent to the central laboratory for storage and analysis. The goals of the translational research will be to determine the association between secondary transmission and (1) influenza virus strain (by genetic sequencing) and (2) viral kinetics (maximum viral load, duration of shedding). The lab will also monitor for the emergence of antiviral resistance among treated cases through identification of PA/I38X and non-PA/138 substitutions for baloxavir and H275Y and other NA mutations for oseltamivir [23, 24].Subgroup analysesSubgroup analyses will be performed to compare influenza incidence rates in youth and family vs. adult shelters. The outcome will be the same as the primary analysis (number of influenza-positive tests).Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, meetings, and the SFS website (SeattleFlu.org). Authorship will follow criteria of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). Modifications to the protocol will be documented in publications and communicated to trial sites through direct contact with the site supervisor.Data safety and monitoringThe study will have a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which will meet prior to the start of subject enrollment and annually to review data from the study. It will be comprised of individuals with expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology, and clinical infectious diseases. The DSBM is responsible for determining if there are problems relating to the safety of the intervention and whether the trial should be stopped. Stopping considerations for the DSMB to recommend terminating the study at the interim analysis (after season 1) include (1) efficacy-based stopping rule based on an O’Brien-Fleming type boundary with alpha = 0.025, (2) operational futility stopping rule if low influenza rate or enrollment rate, or (3) detection of baloxavir resistance and/or transmission of baloxavir-resistant influenza strains. In addition, this study will employ an independent monitor to provide feedback to the investigative team on compliance with protocol and documentation of any protocol violations.SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related modificationsAs a result of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, year 1 of the trial’s intervention was suspended 1 month early on April 1, 2020, until the following flu season. Due to the potential value of data that may continue to be collected directly from shelters to better understand this novel pathogen, the study was modified to revert back to the pre-intervention study period from April 1, 2020–October 31, 2020, when participant recruitment and data collection was previously unplanned at all nine shelters. Additionally, shelter staff working at these study sites became eligible for standard surveillance study participation (clinical and sociodemographic data collected via tablet-based questionnaire and swab collection). From April 1, 2020, onwards, the study was also modified for asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic individuals to be eligible for standard surveillance study participation any time there was a study staff on site recruiting and enrolling participants. This change was made to improve early detection of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases. Eligibility criteria (specifically being a shelter resident and presenting with ARI trigger symptoms) for the trial’s intervention have not changed (see the “Study population” section). Asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic individuals and shelter staff may participate by providing a completed questionnaire and nasal swab specimen at any time throughout the duration of the study period. However, they are never eligible for the on-site testing and treatment trial.Following the early suspension of the trial in year 1 and as a reaction to the ongoing pandemic, three participating shelters were closed and moved residents to new physical locations in an effort to reduce crowding in congregate sleeping spaces. Year 2 of the trial will therefore include nine shelters that have maximum nightly populations ranging from 45 to 275 individuals each, with a total maximum nightly population estimated at 1115 individuals. RSV and influenza return of results within 1 month of study participation on an online platform will also no longer be available.

As part of our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, we looked back at stories from the 1918 elections to see how America met the challenges of holding elections during a national health emergency. We also looked at how Congress handled the pandemic, as well as provided a few modern articles about the 1918 Influenza pandemic to add further context.

Reports at the time suggest the virus became less lethal as the pandemic carried on in waves. But the strand of the flu didn’t just disappear. The influenza virus continuously mutated, passing through humans, pigs and other mammals. The pandemic-level virus morphed into just another seasonal flu. Descendants of the 1918 H1N1 virus make up the influenza viruses we’re fighting today. “The 1918 flu is still with us, in that sense,” said Ann Reid, the executive director of the National Center for Science Education who successfully sequenced the genetic makeup of the 1918 influenza virus in the 1990s. “It never went away.”[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of The Washington Post. October 7, 2020 - "How Does a Pandemic End? Here's What We Can Learn From the 1918 Flu” On October 7, 2020, Time discussed the lessons from the 1918 influenza pandemic's end. “ But, by the middle of 1920, that deadly strain of flu had in fact faded enough that the pandemic was over in many places, even though there was no dramatic or memorable declaration that the end had come. “The end of the pandemic occurred because the virus circulated around the globe, infecting enough people that the world population no longer had enough susceptible people in order for the strain to become a pandemic once again,” says medical historian J. Alexander Navarro, Markel’s colleague and the Assistant Director of the Center for the History of Medicine. “When you get enough people who get immunity, the infection will slowly die out because it’s harder for the virus to find new susceptible hosts.” Eventually, with “fewer susceptible people out and about and mingling,” Navarro says, there was nowhere for the virus to go —the “herd immunity” being talked about today. By the end of the pandemic, a whopping third of the world’s population had caught the virus.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of Time. December 11, 2020 - "Why the 1918 Flu Pandemic Never Really Ended" On December 11, 2020, History published an article looking at how modern flu viruses descended from the virus that caused the 1918 influenza pandemic. “ Since the whole world had been exposed to the virus, and had therefore developed natural immunity against it, the 1918 strain began to mutate and evolve in a process called “antigenic drift.” Slightly altered versions of the 1918 flu reemerged in the winters of 1919-1920 and 1920-1921, but they were far less deadly and nearly indistinguishable from the seasonal flu. “The 1918 flu definitely lost its real virulence by the early 1920s,” says [chief of the Viral Pathogenesis and Evolution Section at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Jeffrey] Taubenberger. But what’s truly incredible, according to genetic analyses, is that the same novel strain of flu first introduced in 1918 appears to be the direct ancestor of every seasonal and pandemic flu we’ve had over the past century. “You can still find the genetic traces of the 1918 virus in the seasonal flus that circulate today,” says Taubenberger. “Every single human infection with influenza A in the past 102 years is derived from that one introduction of the 1918 flu.” [1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of History. March 31, 2021 - "The end of the pandemic is coming – just don’t set a date for the party" On March 31, 2021, Agnes Arnold-Forster, a medical history and healthcare researcher at the University of Bristol, wrote an article in The Conversation that looked at the difficulty of determining when pandemics end. “ The misleadingly named Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 was the deadliest in history. It infected around 500 million people worldwide and killed anywhere from 20 million to 50 million. Much like today, citizens were subjected to social restrictions and ordered to wear masks. The pandemic abated, but identifying its precise end is almost impossible. In 1920, several newspapers reported the reappearance of influenza. Around 5,000 cases were reported in Chicago in the space of six days, and theatres were ordered to close. Later that year, “drastic measures” were implemented to check the spread of flu in New York City after an emergency meeting of the transportation authorities, theatre and cinema owners, and the representatives of department stores. At around the same time, 60 people died from influenza in Paris. Subsequent waves of the virus ripped through European and North American cities for years after the pandemic’s supposed end. As late as 1925, and in the space of nine days, 201 people in Chicago died from what the newspapers called a “highly contagious influenza epidemic”. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that there is little evidence in the historical record of parties to commemorate the end of the terrible virus.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of The Conversation. About the 1918 midterm elections The November 1918 midterm elections were unlike any other. World War I was raging in Europe. The Influenza pandemic started in the spring of 1918, but a second wave would hit the county in September of that year, and be far deadlier. 195,000 Americans died of influenza in October of 1918 alone.[2] That year, voters elected members of the 66th Congress, 34 out of 50 states elected their governors, and many states elected members for state and local offices. Prior to the election, Congress and the White House were both Democrat-controlled, under President Woodrow Wilson. After the election, Republicans gained control of both chambers, taking 25 seats in the House and five seats in the Senate. It was the first time since 1908 that Republicans had control of both the House of Representative and the Senate.[3] Voter turnout for the 1918 elections was low. Voting turnout that year was 40 percent, unlike the midterm elections that took place in 1910 (52 percent) and 1914 (50 percent). The Influenza pandemic and WWI were partly to blame.[3] 1918 would prove to be a turning point for women’s suffrage. Oklahoma, Michigan, South Dakota, and Louisiana all had ballot initiatives to extend the right to vote to women. In all but Louisiana, the measures passed.[3] For more information about other 1918 ballot initiatives, click here. Campaigning during a pandemic came with its challenges. Politicians found that typical campaign methods were not possible with bans prohibiting large gatherings in place. Rallies and speech campaigns were put on hold, and candidates utilized less direct forms of communications, such as direct mail and press coverage in local papers.[2] Voters were also affected by the Influenza pandemic. In Sacramento, California, some poll sites couldn’t be opened, as there were not enough citizens well enough to go to the polls.[2] The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado reported on November 3 that officials from the state health board had issued an order setting precautions for both voters and election officials, including requiring election officials to wear gauze masks and voters to refrain from crowding.[4] 1918 newspaper articles September 29, 1918 - "Vote A Million to Fight ‘Flu" On Sept. 29, The Milwaukee Journal reported on Congressional efforts to combat the spread of influenza throughout the country. “ Congress hurriedly appropriated $1,000,000 to the medical branches of the war and navy departments with which to fight Spanish influenza. Urging immediate passage, Representative Gillett informed the house that both Speaker Champ Clark and Democratic House Leader Kitchin have fallen victims to it. When the appropriation was called up in the senate, Senator Penrose, Pennsylvania, minority leader of the senate finance committee, declared that the measure had not been before the committee and asked whether any executive department of the government had requested it. Senator Martin, Virginia, majority leader, said he did not know, but urged immediate passage as the situation, he said, is rapidly becoming more serious in the New England States and in camps and cantonments.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia.

Many school children have contracted the disease, and it is feared it will be spread to nearly every family in the locality if the children are allowed to continue congregating in the school rooms daily.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia.

Dr. Oscar Dewling, president of the State Board of Health has said the people may go into parks, because plenty of fresh air can be found there, but on stricter analysis, Lafayette Square might not be described as a ‘fresh air park.’ The suffragists, however, have decided the question for themselves and Miss Huberwald announced Wednesday that the meeting for Saturday night had been cancelled.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia.

Pending official action by the state and city health authorities, all plans for opening the extensive speaking campaigns which had been arranged for state candidates were held in abeyance, and campaigns will not be started next Monday morning unless full and free permission is granted by competent authority.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia.

The resolutions were prepared and presented at a meeting called at the church house, Twelfth and Walnut streets, by Rev. Floyd W. Tomkins, rector of the Holy Trinity Church. Rev. Samuel Upjohn, of St. Luke’s Church, presided. It was pointed out that the protest was not made with any intention of defying the rules of the Board of Health, but to assure the people that the services were suspended by the various rectors unwillingly and that in the opinion of those signing the resolution the ruling was wrong. The resolution declares it is inconsistent to close the churches and yet allow people to crowd in cars and stores on the plea that “businesses must go on.” It further states, “It is more important to pray to God than to carry on business and that it is the opinion of the Protestants that god will care for his people when they meet to plead with Him.” [1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia.

Ham Lewis and possibly even President Wilson, prompted Governor Edge to say when asked of his own plans that the only campaigns he is now interested in are those to put over the Fourth Liberty Loan and to suppress the epidemic of influenza.

Twelve days of active work remain for the Republican and Democratic state committees to make their fight for the United States senatorship, the state offices, and for congress and the Illinois legislature. The Cook county political organizations face a remarkable task in their efforts to elect their respective county tickets. Held off until last midnight by the Liberty loan drive and prohibited by the influenza epidemic from making any speaking campaign whatever, the Chicago and Illinois committees are held strictly to publicity and personal organizations work to do the job that usually has been performed by flying squadrons of orators and a prolonged canvas made through the usual political channels.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia.

An extension of one week would make it impossible for politicians to run up the curtain for the brief but spectacular closing speeches they have been planning. They have been setting the rival stages with feverish haste hoping all the while that the ‘flu’ epidemic would subside so that they could go before the voters with the arguments they have prepared.}} Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia.

Mr. Dowel said that the influenza had caused closing of all schools in the State except in four or five counties. However, no time would be lost as the teachers have been doing their State reading circle work. He gave several different ways in which the time would be made up by the pupils. One of the most practical, he suggested, would be to teach one hour later in the afternoons, do some work on Saturday and cut the holiday time down usually taken for Christmas. One county, he said, instead of taking 10 days for Christmas holidays as is the custom, would only take two days this year.”[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia.

The situation is hopeful and the disease seems to be on the wane, but it could not justify the lifting of the ban at this time. Election night, when there is a danger of crowds collecting, might result in an increase in the number of new cases again, as happened directly after the demonstration several weeks ago over the German peace news.

There was no opposition to the Democratic candidates. Less than 1,000 votes were cast in Charleston county and most of these were in the city. Returns were received at the Hibernian Hall. With only five boxes from Wadmalay, Edisto, Meggette, Adams Run and McClellanville missing, the city and rural vote was: State and county, 864; federal, 890. But three votes were cast at Sullivans Island.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia. November 6, 1918 - “Even Influenza Avails Not To Dampen Ardor of Voters” On Nov. 6, 1918, the San Francisco Chronicle discussed the fact that while masks were required to vote, it didn’t deter voters from heading to the polls. “ San Francisco yesterday staged the first masked ballot ever known in the history of America. Everyone who voted had to wear a mask and to that extent was handicapped in the discharge of his electoral responsibilities. Despite that fact, however, or mayhap because of it, the election was described by the officers of the scores of booths visited as the quietest within memory.[1] ” One of those voters was Mrs. Nancy Elworthy. “ Probably the oldest and most lighthearted voter of the day was Mrs. Nancy Elworthy of 1480 Larkin street, who came down unaided from her home to the booth in the middle of the block between California and Pine streets. Mrs. Elworthy is 92, she belongs to one of the “F.F.V’s” and her husband was a field officer in the Confederate army. ‘I thought I would be blind before this election’, she cheerily explained to the officials in the booth, ‘but I can still see a little and I think it is the duty of every citizen to vote at every election as long as he or she can take an intelligent interest in public affairs.’[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the 'University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia. November 6, 1918 - “Flu Prevents Night Parties” On Nov. 6, 1918, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported how quiet election night was due to the influenza pandemic of 1918. “ Darkest night, pierced only by lame street lights and far-scattered horns. A quiet stream of pedestrians and automobiles, moving east and west or stopping on side streets to wait for news. Such was election night. Someone dared recall the nights of torchlight parades, when red flares and drums aided shouts and blows in expressing partisan fervor. Though torchlights fell from favor, horns were still ‘aces high’ when election night last came around. Memories of hilarious hands of young men, older men and old men--even girls and women joining them--parading the streets with banners and blatant horns, prompted a search for such troops last night.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia. November 6, 1918 - "Health Before Politics" On Nov. 6, 1918, the Cincinnati Commercial Tribune reported that Covington, Ohio’s Health Department issued an order that prohibited crowds from gathering to hear election results. “ Covington’s Health Department issued an order Tuesday prohibiting the congregation of crowds in the County Clerk’s office Tuesday night to hear the election returns. It is usual for several hundred eager voters to crowd the office on election nights.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia. November 7, 1918 - “Counting of Ballots Tedious Operation” On November 7, 1918, The Pioneer in Minnesota reported how Bemidji, Minnesota’s precinct counting was a slow process because of the number of candidates and ballots. “ Bemidji’s precinct count dragged throughout election night and far into the next day. Some of the [precincts] started the count on the state ticket and some on the county. The polls closed at 9 o’clock and the lunch hour also occupied its space of time. It was a slow process on account of the number of candidates and state and county ballots. The county precincts commenced to report during the morning following the election and over half the county was in by the evening, with more following today, a hard task being well done...The most distressing incident of the county election was that Editor ‘Bill’ Noonan of the Baudette Region was confined to his room with the Spanish ‘flu.’ Election time and election day is Editor Noonan’s greatest pastime.[1] ” here to read the original article, courtesy of Newspapers.com. November 7, 1918 - “Mask Violators Argue; Are Fined” On Nov. 7, 1918, the Oakland Tribune discussed how masks were required to vote, and those who chose not to wear one would be fined $10 (the equivalent of $169.79 in 2020). “ Heated discussion of election returns is not in violation of law, provided the participant keeps his flu mask properly adjusted; but should he overlook that important matter trouble awaits him. That is the verdict of ten or twelve men fined $10 each after being arrested in the county clerk’s office. Many alibis were offered by the offenders, who maintained that they were seriously handicapped by their masks in arguments over election returns with more fluent talkers. The arm of the law refused to accept any excuses, contending that epidemics could not be checked through the wearing of masks for bibs.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia. November 10, 1918: "Influenza Mars Suffrage Plans" On Nov. 10, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported on the cancellation of a gathering of suffragettes in Lafayette Square whose purpose was to collect signatures for a petition aimed at amending the state constitution to allow women the right to vote. “ “Everything conspires against women’s suffrage,” one local suffragist said Wednesday. “Now it is the influenza which is trying to prevent a spread of the suffrage doctrine, but obedient to the demands of the health authorities the suffragists will refrain from public gatherings.” Miss Florence Huberwald was scheduled to open the suffrage speaking campaign in New Orleans with a mass meeting in Lafayette Square Saturday night. Dr. Oscar Dowling, president of the State Board of Health, has said the people may go into the parks, because plenty of fresh air may be found there, but on strict analysis, Lafayette Square might not be described as a “fresh air park.” The suffragists, however, have decided the question for themselves and Miss Huberwald announced Wednesday the meeting for Saturday night had been cancelled.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia. November 13, 1918: "College Students are Afflicted with ‘Flu’” On Nov. 13, The Deseret Evening News reported on an influenza outbreak at Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah. “ Twenty cases of Spanish influenza were reported to exist at the Westminster college this morning by Dr. H.W. Reherd, president of that institution. However, the college is under a strict quarantine and the situation is said to be well under control. According to Dr. Reherd, the disease made its appearance the latter part of last week but absolute obeyance of orders has halted the epidemic and it is now reported on the downward path. When the influenza attacked the city and state over a month ago, the Westminster college had enrolled about 60 students some of whom came from a distance of hundreds of miles. Therefore, realizing the inadvisability of sending them home, Dr. Reherd communicated with Dr. T.B. Beatty, state health officer. “We decided,” said Dr. Reherd, “that in view of the isolated location of the college, classes could be continued among the dormitory students without interference from the ‘flu’. The resident students of Salt Lake were sent home and kept in touch with the advance of the dormitory scholars by telephone.”[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia. November 18, 1918: "Was the 'Flu' to Blame?" On Nov. 18, 1918, the Oakland Tribune questioned the closure of a voting precinct in a state Senate race that was decided by three votes.[5] “ How important results sometimes hinge on inconsiderable and unexpected incidents is illustrated in the fight in the second senatorial district. Because of the prevalence of the influenza, the polls of Ingot precinct in Shasta county remained closed on election day. In that precinct, 95 voters are registered "It is believed that the State Senate will be so constituted by this result that ratification of the national prohibition measure may be defeated. Eifendahl might have been elected if the polls of Ingot precinct had been open. It is also possible that a refusal by California to endorse this national amendment may be the turning of a tide against it.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia. December 6, 1918, "Masking Order is To Be Rigidly Enforced" On Dec. 6, 1918, The Deseret Evening News reported on mask politics in Utah’s Salt Lake County. “ Vigorous enforcement of the health order requiring the wearing of influenza masks in Salt Lake county outside the limits of incorporated cities, is already under way, says Dr. T.J. Howlls, county physician. Dr. Howells expressed impatience this morning that the wearing of masks had not been made compulsory in Salt Lake City. “Much of our country influenza is traceable to Salt Lake City,” said Dr. Howells. “We regard Salt Lake as the menacing source of spread of the disease for the county. Dr. Howells said that he is not urging the use of the masks as preferable to vaccination but is urging both. The mask, he points outs, is more quickly adopted universally. It can be adopted by an entire population overnight, while to vaccinate all requires much time at best.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia. December 19, 2020: "Theater Owners May Carry Fight On Ban To Court" On Sept. 29, Spokane Daily Chronicle reported on theater managers’ campaign to convince health officials to remove a ban on theaters. “ Spokane theater managers may resort to the courts in an effort to force the health department to raise the influenza ban. If petitions now being circulated for a reopening are turned by the city health officer, it is said the matter is to be taken to the state board of health and, if no favorable action is obtained there, legal action may be started.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the University of Michigan Center for the History of Medicine and Michigan Publishing's Influenza Encyclopedia. Modern analysis about the 1918 influenza pandemic and midterm elections March 14, 2020 - “In 1918, the Spanish flu infected the White House. Even President Wilson got sick.” On Mar. 14, 2020, The Washington Post discussed the impact the 1918 influenza had on the White House. “ In the fall of 1918, as President Woodrow Wilson scrambled to end World War I, the Spanish flu slithered its way through D.C., unsettling daily life in the same ways covid-19 is upending America today...Churches were closed. Public dance halls were shuttered. No corner of the nation’s capital was spared — not even the White House. Wilson’s personal secretary was among the first in his administration to be sickened by a pandemic that would ultimately infect 500 million people. Margaret, his eldest daughter, got it. Secret Service members did, too. Even the White House sheep were not spared...Also not spared: the President of the United States.[1] ” Click here to read the full article, courtesy of The Washington Post. March 18, 2020 - “We Held an Election During the 1918 Flu Epidemic. We Can Hold an Election Now” On March 18, 2020, Slate published an article about how the county managed to maintain voters' constitutional commitment during the 1918 influenza pandemic. “We have held federal elections before even in the face of pandemics. In 1918, a midterm election year, Americans went to the polls to exercise their fundamental right to vote, even as the Spanish flu resulted in the death of millions worldwide. Governments devised ways of protecting the public, while maintaining our fundamental constitutional commitment to democratic self-rule. In some places, voters had to disperse and wait at the polls single file; in others, voters and poll workers had to wear masks. Campaigning and election year rallies were undoubtedly affected, but, as one study concluded, “in most places the election was held with relatively few complications.” The 1918 election, all but forgotten until recent events, shows how we have kept our commitment to our fundamental democratic principles even when battling life-threatening crises.” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of Slate. March 21, 2020 - “The Lessons of the Elections of 1918” On Mar. 21, 2020, The New York Times discussed how, despite the Influenza epidemic, the nation managed to vote and keep democracy intact. “ Across the country, citizens were ordered to hunker in their homes to avoid catching a deadly virus even as some people thought it was nothing worse than a seasonal cold. In the midst of fear and sickness, politicians had to decide how to hold scheduled elections, and the global pandemic was subject to political spin. The year was 1918 when a deadly flu outbreak gripped the nation, infecting about a third of the world’s population and killing 675,000 people in the United States alone.[1] ” Click here to read the full article, courtesy of The New York Times. March 23, 2020 - “This Isn’t The First Time America Has Weathered A Crisis In An Election Year” On Mar. 23, 2020, FiveThirtyEight discussed how events, including the influenza pandemic, had affected U.S. elections in the past. “ ...There’s still a lot we don’t know about the current health crisis we find ourselves in — how long will the urgency of the coronavirus threat last, for example, or how things will look come November — but if we’re looking at elections comparable to our current moment, the most relevant may be the 1918 midterm. That fall, in the waning days of World War I, the Spanish flu — a strain of influenza that got that name because Spain was one of the few countries to report on it freely — ravaged the United States, killing hundreds of thousands of people, many in the lead-up to the November election. In response to this devastating disease, public health officials tried to limit its spread, but those mitigation policies affected political campaigns. Marian Moser Jones, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health who studies the influenza pandemic, pointed to bans on public gatherings, which we’re seeing now too. ‘[Y]ou couldn’t have the usual election speeches, which were then even more important because you didn’t have television or radio,’ Jones said. ‘[Candidates] had to actually campaign via newspaper editorials and mailings.’[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of FiveThirtyEight. April 7, 2020 - “Voting during a pandemic? Here's what happened in 1918” On Apr. 7, 2020, CBS News discussed what it was like to vote during the Influenza pandemic. “ In early March, while the remaining Democratic presidential contenders were sprinting across the country in search of primary victories, the COVID-19 pandemic was taking its own destructive path through the nation. States with upcoming primaries were forced by the novel virus to reconsider a question from a century ago about how to keep the public safe at the ballot box. The last time a health emergency so imperiled American politics was in 1918 when the Spanish flu killed 675,000 Americans and was dubbed the 'mother of all pandemics.' The flu peaked in October and November that year, according to the American College of Emergency Physicians, just days before the midterm elections on November 5.[1] ” Click here to read the full article, courtesy of CBS News April 20, 2020 - “A pandemic nearly derailed the women's suffrage movement” On Apr. 20, 2020, National Geographic discussed the impact the Influenza pandemic had on the women’s suffrage movement. “ ‘These are sad times for the whole world, grown unexpectedly sadder by the sudden and sweeping epidemic of influenza,’ wrote Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, in a letter to supporters in 1918. ‘This new affliction is bringing sorrow into many suffrage homes and is presenting a serious new obstacle in our Referendum campaigns and in the Congressional and Senatorial campaigns,’ she continued. ‘We must therefore be prepared for failure.’ Suffragists had been fighting for women’s right to vote for 70 years, and victory seemed almost in reach. Even with the United States fully mobilized for World War I. President Woodrow Wilson had come out in support of a constitutional amendment, and the House of Representatives had passed it.[1] ” Click here to read the full article, courtesy of National Geographic June 1, 2020 - “America pulled off an election during the Spanish flu, but not without paying a price” On June 1, 2020, NBC News published an article about how American managed to pull off the 1918 midterm elections in the middle of a pandemic. “President Woodrow Wilson and the Democrats were fiercely fighting to maintain control of Congress during the 1918 November midterm elections. With much of the nation hunkered down under quarantine orders with social distancing and mandatory masks, conducting an election was proving to be daunting. But with World War I still raging on, a heightened sense of patriotism swept the country. Despite the strict orders in place, voting was considered essential at the time. As officials scramble to safely conduct primary contests amid the coronavirus pandemic, worries mount about how the country can safely conduct a presidential election this November. How officials handled voting during the Spanish flu pandemic offers crucial lessons on balancing public health with democracy.” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of NBC News Congressional history Congressional closure in October 1918 Congress also closed its doors for an extended period of time during the 1918 pandemic. According to the U.S. House website, the closure was triggered when Washington, D.C. was hit by the flu:[6] “ In early October, as the city shuttered most public gathering places, Congress began to feel the effects of the flu as well. On October 6, it was reported that Democratic Leader Claude Kitchin of North Carolina was stricken with the ‘grip,’ and had been confined to his bed for several days. Then Speaker Champ Clark fell ill. Over the course of the next week, both men started to recover even as many of their colleagues fell sick and were bed-ridden.[1] ” On October 7, as the House was about to adjourn for the day out of respect for the death of Rep. J. Fred Talbott, Illinois Congressman Henry T. Rainey made the following request:[6] “ Mr. Speaker, it is a matter of common knowledge that an epidemic of alarming proportions is prevailing throughout the country. Out of an abundant precaution the Senate has ordered the galleries closed, which action, I understand, meets with the approval of the medical authorities, and so I ask unanimous consent that the Speaker be instructed to close the galleries of the House until further action shall be taken by the House.[1] ” His request was granted, and the House followed the Senate in closing its doors until November 4, resulting in nearly a month of being out of session. Conditions in the city were grim during the congressional closure.[6] “ While the flu outbreak did not close the House entirely, it slowed its activities to a crawl. For much of the first half of October the chamber stood in recess punctuated by brief pro forma sessions which few Members attended. Sickness, as well as the need to care for ailing family members, substantially thinned the ranks of the House. Within days the decision was made to close the Capitol ‘to all visitors as an extra precaution.’ In just the preceding 24 hours, 74 Washingtonians had died and health officials treated more than 1,600 new flu cases.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of the U.S. House of Representatives Archives. October 25, 2016 - “Wilson intervenes in midterm election: Oct. 25, 1918” On Oct. 25, 2016, POLITICO discussed the actions taken by President Wilson 10 days prior to the midterm election in 1918. “ On this day in 1918, 10 days before the congressional midterm elections, President Woodrow Wilson called for the return of a Democratic Congress as essential to maintaining the nation’s security. Up until then, Wilson was widely viewed as a war leader who — midway through his second term — successfully had held himself above the political fray. Historians regard his maladroit attempt to influence the political outcome on Capitol Hill as a decisive turning point in his presidency. The 1918 campaigns were conducted amid U.S. military participation in World War I. At the same time, the nation was dealing with a deadly, debilitating influenza epidemic. Through the prior 18 months of U.S. involvement, congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle had downplayed their partisan differences. Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge (R-Mass.), the minority leader, privately warned his colleagues to suspend their ‘attacks on Wilson that we all want to make [to avoid] the charge that we are drawing the party line and the cry that we are not loyal to the war.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of POLITICO. House of Representative Closes Public Galleries during 1918 Influenza Pandemic On Oct. 7, 1918, the House of Representatives closed its public galleries in the midst of the 1918 influenza epidemic. With most House members absent due to illness during an abbreviated session on October 7, Illinois Rep. Henry T. Rainey addressed those present on the need to close the galleries to prevent the spread of the disease. “ Mr. Speaker, it is a matter of common knowledge that an epidemic of alarming proportions is prevailing throughout the country,’ Rainey said. ‘Out of an abundant precaution the Senate has ordered the galleries closed, which action, I understand, meets with the approval of the medical authorities, and so I ask unanimous consent that the Speaker be instructed to close the galleries of this House until further action shall be taken by the House.’[1] ” Click here to read the full article, courtesy of The United States House of Representatives Archives. Historical information about other notable pandemics May 16, 2020 - “Why American life went on as normal during the killer pandemic of 1969” On May 16, 2020, the New York Post discussed what happened during the 1969 H3N2 pandemic, also known as the “Hong Kong Flu.” H3N2 claimed the lives of over 1 million people. “ H3N2 (or the ‘Hong Kong flu,’ as it was more popularly known) was an influenza strain that the New York Times described as ‘one of the worst in the nation’s history.’ The first case of H3N2, which evolved from the H2N2 influenza strain that caused the 1957 pandemic, was reported in mid-July 1968 in Hong Kong. By September, it had infected Marines returning to the States from the Vietnam War. By mid-December, the Hong Kong flu had arrived in all 50 states. But schools were not shut down nationwide, other than a few dozen because of too many sick teachers. Face masks weren’t required or even common. Though Woodstock was not held during the peak months of the H3N2 pandemic (the first wave ended by early March 1969, and it didn’t flare up again until November of that year), the festival went ahead when the virus was still active and had no known cure.[1] ” Click here to read the original article, courtesy of The New York Post. Use of the term Spanish Flu The term Spanish Flu is widely used to describe the 1918 influenza pandemic. While there is no evidence indicating that the 1918 influenza had origins in Spain, it was given the name Spanish Flu because of issues related to World War I. During the war, nations on both sides of the conflict censored newspapers and other media, and this censorship extended to reporting on cases of the flu as a means to prevent decreased morale. Spain, a neutral country in the conflict, did not censor its press. This resulted in the only in-depth accounts of the flu being available in Spanish, leading to the assumption that the pandemic was worst in Spain.[7] In May 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued new guidelines on naming infectious diseases that forbid using names that include geographic locations, people's names, and animals, among others. That same WHO release said that "[d]iseases are often given common names by people outside of the scientific community. Once disease names are established in common usage through the Internet and social media, they are difficult to change, even if an inappropriate name is being used."[8] Ballotpedia primarily uses the term 1918 influenza pandemic to describe the event. However, we will occasionally use the term Spanish Flu to describe the pandemic because it is a common name for the event.

This serves to ensure the supply of the population with products of medical need of national importance during the epidemic situation as established by the German Bundestag on March 28, 2020. The Paul-Ehrlich-Institut has previously evaluated the documents provided by the marketing authorisation holder, which contain the quality, efficacy and safety data required for a marketing authorisation according to Section 22 German Medicines Act (Arzneimittelgesetz, AMG). The documents also include the batch protocols of the batches that are marketed in Germany. The evaluation of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut has shown that the required quality is guaranteed and that there is a positive benefit-risk ratio. The decision to place the vaccine on the market was made by the Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesgesundheitsministerium, BMG) in accordance with the MedBVSV, among other things based on the evaluation of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut.

Myth: If you have influenza and get a COVID-19 test, that test will come back positive for COVID-19.Fact: The COVID-19 nasal swab test cannot detect influenza, and therefore a false positive is very unlikely.The type of test that Canada is using, the nasal swab test, is specifically designed to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19.The test does this by detecting a very specific genetic sequence in SARS-CoV-2, a genetic sequence that influenza and common cold viruses do not have.“These genes provide viruses with proteins that allow them to make more copies of themselves, dictate which types of cells they can infect, and can interfere with the circuitry that our cells use to mount immune responses against them,” said Dr. Jason Kindrachuk, assistant professor in the department of medical microbiology at the University of Manitoba. Story continues below advertisement “It’s kind of like two bestselling fiction novels — they can both come from the same section of the book store and attract a certain type of reader. However, when you open them up, the words on the pages result in two very different stories.”In other words, the test that we use looks only for the coronavirus, not influenza, and therefore, influenza cannot produce a false positive. Myth: If the novel coronavirus is spreading, the flu must also be spreading at equal rates.

There are several reasons why the flu isn’t spreading, said Kindrachuk.“This is a result of the additional protective measures that we’re all participating in for COVID-19: distancing, masking, limited time in enclosed areas with low ventilation, hygiene, etc.,” Kindrachuk said.“Seasonal influenza viruses, while transmitted in a similar way to SARS-CoV-2, appear to be transmitted to a lower number of people per infectious person.”This means, of course, that the fewer people who get influenza, the fewer people will be infected in the community. Add in protective measures we’ve already been doing since March, and you get a slower spread of the virus, said Kindrachuk. Story continues below advertisement “We also have the advantage with influenza viruses of pre-existing immunity through our natural exposure to these viruses during our lifetimes and as well through prior and current vaccinations.“With COVID-19, we don’t have that buffer of pre-existing immunity in our communities, nor licensed vaccines.” Myth: The novel coronavirus is no more deadly than the flu.Fact: The novel coronavirus is three to four times as deadly as influenza in Canada.According to Canada Public Health, about 3,500 people die yearly from influenza in Canada.As of Nov. 19, there have been about 11,500 deaths from COVID-19 in Canada since March.

A man in his 20s was also reported dead, but that was corrected later by the province as a clerical error.Unfortunately, said Katz, those who have had mild illnesses have enhanced the myth that younger people don’t become seriously ill from the virus.“We know from evidence coming out now that many people who are infected with this illness end up having long-term consequences of it,” said Katz. “And these are quite varied and very concerning and not predictable by the severity of the initial illness.“We’re seeing people who have mild illness, who don’t need hospitalization at all, also have long-term consequences.

Scientists have proven that cooler temperatures weaken our immune system, making us more susceptible to illness and infection. Additionally, cooler weather toughens the outer shell of viruses, making it easier for them to travel from person to person. The immune system naturally weakens with age, which means winter can be even more dangerous for older adults. Here’s a list of four vaccines that Medicare helps pay for and that you should talk with your doctor about to help protect yourself from illness. Influenza Vaccine What is the flu? The flu—or influenza—is a contagious respiratory illness that can be severe and life-threatening. Why is it important for older adults to get the flu shot? Older adults—even if you are healthy—are at higher risk when it comes to the flu due to age-related weakening of our immune systems, making it more difficult for us to fight off disease. For the 86 percent of adults 65+ who are managing a chronic condition—like diabetes or heart disease—the flu can be even more dangerous because you are more likely to develop complications or become hospitalized. Flu combined with pneumonia—a common acute condition among the aging population—is one of the top 10 causes of death for those aged 65+ in the U.S. And while they are similiarities between the flu and COVID-19, one the most important differences is that there is a vaccine to protect against the flu. There currently isn't a vaccine for COVID-19. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flu vaccination is the best way to prevent the flu. To address the increased risks faced by the aging population, a higher-dose version of the flu vaccine was created specifically for older adults – talk to your doctor today about this option. When should you get the flu shot? You should get a flu shot annually. For older adults, it’s best that you get your vaccine as early in the season as possible to prevent contracting the flu from a loved one, caregiver, or friend. Flu season in the U.S. typically peaks between November and March, meaning it’s vital for you to get your shot before the holidays start. It’s important to note that it does take two weeks after getting the shot for your body to build up full immunity. Where can you get the flu shot? Your best option for getting the flu shot is to make an appointment with your physician. You can also visit your local clinic or drug store to receive the shot, but it’s a good idea to call ahead as some locations do run out of the vaccine. Use the Flu Vaccine Locator to find all locations near you that offer the flu vaccine. How does Medicare cover the cost of the flu shot? The flu vaccine is a once a year, cost-free Medicare Part B benefit. For Original Medicare, you must use a physician or healthcare provider who accepts Medicare, and for Medicare Advantage, you may have to use an in-network doctor or pharmacy. Shingles Vaccine What is shingles? Shingles is a painful skin rash that’s caused by the same virus responsible for chickenpox. Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox, and can only be passed on to another person up until the point when the infected person’s blisters begin to scab. Even after shingles passes, long-term pain can linger. Why is it important for older adults to get the shingles vaccine? Researchers believe that the age-related weakening of our immune systems can trigger the “reawakening” of the dormant chickenpox virus. One in three adults contracts shingles at some point in their life—the majority of whom are 60 years or older—and the older you are when you get shingles, the more likely you are to have severe side effects, like fever, exhaustion, and loss of appetite. These can lead to malnutrition, physical deterioration, and/or additional infections. Whether you remember having chickenpox as a child or not, you should still talk to your doctor about getting vaccinated. When should you get the shingles vaccine? There are two shingles vaccines available for healthy older adults. The CDC recommends that healthy adults over age 50 get a two-dose version of the vaccine. The shots are generally given several months apart, and is about 90% effective after you’ve had both shots. The single dose vaccine may still be used for healthy people over age 60. If you’ve had the single dose version of the vaccine, talk with your doctor to see if you need to get the new two-dose version. Where can you get the shingles vaccine? Your physician or local pharmacy can administer the shingles vaccine. To search for a local clinic or pharmacy, check out the Vaccine Locator. How does Medicare cover the cost of the shingles vaccine? All Medicare Part D drug plans, or Medicare Advantage plans that include prescription coverage, typically covered the shingles vaccine, usually with an out-of-pocket cost. As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, beginning Jan. 1, 2023, there will be no cost-sharing for all adult vaccines covered under Part D that are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. That means shingles is covered with no out-of-pocket costs. Pneumococcal Vaccine What is pneumococcal disease? Pneumococcal disease causes severe infections throughout the bloodstream and/or key organs. While you may not have heard of pneumococcal disease, you have probably heard of the conditions that result from this disease, including pneumonia (infection of the lungs), meningitis (infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord), and bacteremia (infection of the bloodstream). Pneumococcal disease can result in deafness, brain damage, loss of limbs, and even death. Why is it important for older adults to get the pneumococcal vaccine? Pneumococcal disease kills 18,000 adults 65+ each year. A weakening immune system means that older adults are at greater risk, and can face more severe side effects, especially those who are managing chronic diseases. When should you get the pneumococcal vaccine? The pneumococcal vaccine—you may hear people call it the pneumonia vaccine—is actually two shots given about a year apart. Check with your doctor to see if you’ve had either shot already. Where can you get the pneumococcal vaccine? You can usually make an appointment with your doctor to receive the vaccine, or visit your local clinic or pharmacy. Check out the HealthMap Vaccine Finder to find all locations near you that offer the vaccine. How does Medicare cover the cost of the pneumococcal vaccine? The pneumococcal vaccine is a cost-free benefit covered by Medicare Part B. For Original Medicare, you must use a physician or healthcare provider who accepts Medicare, and for Medicare Advantage, you may have to use an in-network doctor or pharmacy. Hepatitis B Vaccine What is the hepatitis B virus? Hepatitis B (or hep B) is a contagious virus that infects the liver. Acute hep B, which usually lasts a few weeks, often mimicks symptoms similar to the flu, like fever and nausea. Chronic hep B is long-term, often has no symptoms at all, and can cause liver damage or death. Why is it important for older adults to get the hepatitis B vaccine? The liver and its function change as you age, making hep B more prevalent among older adults. Your risk of contracting hepatitis B increases if you have hemophilia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes, or other conditions that lower resistance to infection. Acute hep B is particularly dangerous for older adults because there is no specific treatment for the symptoms. When should you get the hepatitis B vaccine? The hepatitis B vaccine is a series of three or four injections received over six months. Most Americans are vaccinated against hepatitis B as infants. If you are not sure if you’ve been vaccinated or if you are in a situation where you may need to update your vaccination, contact your doctor immediately. Where can you get the hepatitis B vaccine? Your doctor, a local clinic or a drug store can administer the vaccine. Use the Adult Vaccine Finder to find a location in your community. How does Medicare cover the cost of the hepatitis B vaccine? Medicare Part B insurance covers the full cost of the hep B vaccine if (A) a doctor determines that you are at high or medium risk of contracting the hep B virus, and (B) the physician or healthcare provider administering the vaccine accepts Medicare. Consult your doctor to determine your risk of getting hep B. Make a plan to get vaccinated today Getting these vaccines and a COVID-19 booster (also covered by Medicare) is an important part of healthy aging, and they also help ensure the health of your friends and family. Call your doctor today to see if these vaccines are right for your health, and then check with your Medicare provider about where you can get them. If you know someone who may not be vaccinated, share this information with them so they can take the next step toward protecting themselves. This article, originally published on Nov. 24, 2020, was updated on Dec. 7, 2022, to reflect new Medicare coverage of the shingles vaccine effective January 2023. Medicare also covers COVID-19 vaccinations.

There are many contrasting ideas on the effectiveness of influenza vaccination on CVDs. This study aimed to investigate the association between influenza vaccination and the risk of CVDs. We systematically searched all PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library entries up to November 2019 for studies of influenza vs. the CVDs outcomes. We conducted a random-effects meta‐analysis using the inverse variance method for pooled risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) and evaluated statistical heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We identified 17 studies (6 randomized controlled trial [RCT], 5 cohorts, and 6 case–control) with a total of 180,043 cases and 276,898 control participants. The pooled RR of developing CVDs after influenza vaccination in RCT studies was 0.55 (95% CI 0.41–0.73), which was significant (P-value = 0.00). The pooled OR of decreasing CVDs after influenza vaccination in cohort studies was 0.89 (95% CI 0.77–1.04). The pooled OR of developing CVDs after influenza vaccination by pooling case–control studies was 0.70 (95% CI 0.57–0.86, (P-value = 0.00). All of these studies suggest decreased risks of CVDs with influenza vaccination. The current study does support the protective role of influenza vaccination on CVDs events. Health authorities may develop evidence-based preventive strategies to offer influenza vaccination in patients with CVDs.

There are two common types of vaccines, including inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). The IIVs include two groups, trivalent (IIV3) and quadrivalent (IIV4), depending on the number of strains they contain. The IIV3 contains an H1N1 virus, an H3N2 virus, and a B virus. The LAIV, like IIV4, is a quadrivalent vaccine that contains A and B viruses2. There are strong recommendations for influenza vaccination in European and North American countries, where six months and older should be vaccinated annually3.Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) defined as ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular ischemic disease (the most common type of stroke), heart failure, arrhythmia, heart valve problems, and peripheral vascular disease are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the world4.There are many contrasting ideas on the effectiveness of influenza vaccination on CVDs events. On the one hand, some observational studies demonstrate a positive relationship between influenza vaccination and a reduced incidence of cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI)5,6. On the other hand, some epidemiological studies indicate that influenza vaccines do not have much effect7.A comprehensive study has not been conducted in recent years, so we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in patients with cardiovascular events such as AMI, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. The review compared outcomes in patients who had been vaccinated against influenza versus those who had not been vaccinated against influenza to investigate the risk of cardiovascular events. Thus. The current study aimed to investigate the association between influenza vaccination and the risk of CVDs.MethodsThis review conforms to the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses” (PRISMA) statement8. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (pending registration ID: 214862).Search strategy and study selectionA search of the English medical literature was conducted using Medline (via PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL) from January 1, 2000, to November 23, 2019. Clinical studies investigating the relationship between influenza vaccination and subsequent risk for the development of CVDs in patients aged 18 years old or older were selected. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), cohort studies, and case–control studies that were written in English. We used the following MeSH terms: “‘influenza vaccines’ and ‘myocardial infarction’” (Table S1). Keyword searches were done with combinations of the terms “influenza”, “flu”, “respiratory infection”, “myocardial infarction”, “cardiovascular”, “atherosclerosis”, “atrial fibrillation”, “stroke” and “coronary”. Lists of references of selected articles and relevant review articles were hand-searched to identify further studies. Title and abstracts of the articles identified by the initial search were independently evaluated by two authors and any disagreements were resolved by the lead investigator. Then, all potentially relevant articles were obtained and evaluated in detail. Articles were assessed independently by 2 investigators and any disagreements between them were resolved by discussion. The primary outcome assessed was the occurrence of CVDs in patients receiving vaccination in comparison to patients without any vaccination. The exclusion criteria were: conference abstract, case report, studies comparing high and low doses of influenza vaccination, and studies investigating predictors of influenza vaccination uptake among adults with a history of a heart attack.Data extractionAll data were extracted by the lead investigator to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (XP professional edition; Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA). The following data were extracted: first author, country of origin, type of study, inclusion period, the definition of case and control, disease type, and the total number of controls and cases.Quality assessmentThe checklists provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) for cohort studies9, case–control studies10, and RCTs11 were used to perform the quality assessment.Statistical analysisPooled results were expressed as the risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) of patients with vaccination compared with no vaccination, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Each meta-analysis was performed separately for randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case–control studies. For each meta-analysis, the method of Der Simonian and Laird was used12. According to this method, studies were considered a random sample from a population of studies. Statistical heterogeneity was tested for each analysis by the I2 statistic. Due to the heterogeneity among studies, a random-effect model was used to analyze data. Publication bias was assessed statistically using Begg’s test (p < 0.05 was considered indicative of statistically significant publication bias). All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, Version 2.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ).ResultsOf the 435 articles identified, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). The characteristics of the included articles are summarized in Table 1. Among included studies: 6 articles had RCT, 5 articles had a cohort, and 6 articles had case–control designs. Based on JBI, all included studies had a low risk of bias. In the RCT articles, there were 3677 cases and 3681 controls among the whole population. There were 78,522 cases and 127,833 controls in the cohort studies and 97,844 cases and 145,384 controls in the case–control studies.Figure 1Flow chart of study selection for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis.Full size imageTable 1 Characteristics of included studies.Full size tableRCT studiesSix RCT studies investigated the risk of CVD after influenza vaccination. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 2, the RR of developing CVD events after influenza vaccination was 0.55 (95% CI 0.41–0.73). Thus, influenza vaccination significantly decreased the risk of developing CVD events (P-value = 0.00).Table 2 Pooled RR or OR for included studies.Full size tableFigure 2Pooled RR for RCT studies.Full size imageCohort studiesSix case–control studies investigated the risk of developing CVD after influenza vaccination.

In these studies, vaccination against influenza significantly decreased the risk of developing CVD (P-value = 0.00).Figure 4Pooled OR for case–control studies.Full size imageDiscussionOur meta-analyses of RCT and case–control studies showed a significant decrease in the risk of developing CVD events as a result of influenza vaccination. Also, the analysis of cohort studies represented a decrease in the risk of CVDs, whereas it was not statistically significant.CVD is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity around the world13. CVD is more prevalent in the cold seasons, which coincides with influenza outbreaks occurring during the same period. Low temperatures and influenza infection both appear to exacerbate the symptoms of CVD, so that hospitalization due to myocardial infarction also increases in winter with outbreaks of influenza14,15.During influenza seasons in the United States, 54–70% of hospitalizations and 71–85% of deaths occurred among adults aged more than 65 annually were reported to be due to influenza infection16. Some of the mechanisms by which influenza infection affects CVD events include endothelial dysfunction, development of acute obstruction of coronary arteries by causing hypoxia and tachycardia, inducement of pro-inflammatory cytokines, disruptive effects on anticoagulant mechanisms, and pro-coagulant activity17,18,19. Influenza infection by triggering the thrombosis of a pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque can lead to acute coronary occlusion and subsequent AMI20. Additionally, inflammatory cell infiltration due to the infection may cause rupture of vulnerable plaques which in turn can result in acute coronary syndromes21.Researchers have recently indicated that influenza vaccines may be a useful strategy to reduce CVD events, especially in high-risk groups who are prone to undergo more severe complications22. Gurfinkel and colleagues reported a significant reduction of the risk of death and ischemic events in patients suffering from CVD following a single intramuscularly dose of influenza vaccination23. In the case of AMI, the effectiveness of influenza vaccination was reported to be between 19 and 45% based on relevant studies24,25. The results of Wu et al., the study confirmed the beneficial role of influenza vaccination in reducing the risk of CVDs in elderly patients with previous myocardial infarction26.Calderia and colleagues conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of self-controlled case series about the risk of MI associated with Influenza infection as well as the effects of vaccination .they concluded that the Influenza vaccination was safe regarding the short-term risk for MI27. Their results were in line with our study.Barens and colleagues in 2015 evaluated the effect of the influenza vaccination on AMI in a meta-analysis of case–control studies. They reported a significant association between recent influenza infection and AMI as well as the influenza vaccine effectiveness for secondary prevention of AMI28. The results of the current study also showed the protective role of influenza vaccination on CVD events.In recent years, several studies have been published to evaluate influenza vaccination to reduce the risk of CVD events. Some of these studies have shown that the vaccine is effective and safe in reducing the risk of MI, while some have not achieved this result and have not considered vaccination as a useful way to reduce the risk of MI. Of course, several factors, including the inclusion and exclusion criteria of patients, the geographical area, genetic background or underlying condition, and other factors can affect the results of different studies.However, meta-analysis studies that have reviewed and summarized existing research have generally shown the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The results of the present study, after reviewing the pros and cons, finally confirm these beneficial effects.Although vaccination is a simple, inexpensive, and affordable way to control many infections and their complications, especially in people with predisposing factors such as CVDs, this vaccination program has not received much attention in many countries29,30. Additionally, the rate of vaccination is as low as about 30% in groups younger than 65 years old that are at high risk for cardiovascular disease and its associated complications17,31. Accordingly, we recommend that physicians be given sufficient information regarding the protective effect of influenza vaccination and encourage patients with CVD, particularly those in high-risk age groups such as the elderly, who are more likely to develop severe complications from infections, to receive an annual flu vaccine, especially before the onset of cold seasons.Our study had some limitations. First, only studies in English were included, which may have caused important studies to be missed. Second, heterogeneity exists among the included studies, which may limit our interpretation of the association of influenza vaccination with a lower risk of cardiovascular events. Third, our included studies were limited to some Western and Asian countries, whereas differ notably about stroke incidence. Finally, the potential influence of age, sex, and time of vaccination could not be analyzed because of the limited information obtained from the studied articles.In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis do support the protective role of influenza vaccination on CVD events. Health authorities may develop evidence-based preventive strategies to offer influenza vaccination in patients with CVDs. ReferencesBacker, J. et al.

The disease, commonly called bird flu, has been found in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Britain, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and, for the first time this week in Croatia, Slovenia and Poland, after severely hitting Russia, Kazakhstan and Israel. The vast majority of cases are in migrating wild birds but outbreaks have been reported on farms, leading to the death or culling of at least 1.6 million chickens and ducks so far around the region. In the Netherlands, Europe's largest exporter of chicken meat and eggs, nearly 500,000 chickens died or were culled due to the virus this autumn, and over 900,000 hens died on one single farm in Poland this week, the countries' ministries said. “The risk of a transfer in poultry farms and more cases among wild birds is higher than in the past two years because of the massive appearance of various bird flu viruses in Europe,” said a spokeswoman for the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute, Germany's federal animal disease research agency. Russia's poultry death toll reached 1.8 million by the end of October, with nearly 1.6 million of that on one farm near Kazakhstan, data by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) showed. The main strain found this year in Europe is H5N8, which decimated flocks in 2016/17 when the region recorded its largest outbreak in poultry and wild birds, but there were also reports of H5N5 and H5N1. Although the risk to humans is low, the European Food Safety Agency EFSA said this week that the virus' evolution needed to be closely monitored. A strain of H5N1 has been known to spread to humans. EU poultry industry players said they were very concerned about the latest outbreak but were now experienced in dealing with them. “We have worked so hard to improve safety, to train breeders and improve traceability that we hope that if there are cases we will manage to contain them,” said Anne Richard, head of France's poultry industry lobby ANVOL. Most counties have raised their alert status to “high”, implying that poultry and birds of all types be kept indoors or protected in order to avoid contact with wild birds. Bird flu outbreaks like other animal diseases often prompt importing countries to impose trade restrictions. That will add to coronavirus-related lockdowns threatening to curb year-end holiday sales. “It's already difficult to export with the COVID, it would make it even worse,” Denis Lambert, chief executive of France's largest poultry group LDC told reporter.

Numerous users on social media have claimed that coronavirus tests are inaccurate and ineffective and encouraged their followers not to take or trust them."A positive test for COVID-19 only means you have antibodies for the flu and/or the common cold," reads a post on Instagram. "DONT TAKE THE TEST!""Stop testing yourselves!!! If you've had a cold (coronavirus) you will test positive for COVID 19. If you've had the flu. You will test positive for COVID. If you've been vaccinated for influenza, you will test positive for COVID," reads a post on Facebook.The users behind the posts did not respond to requests from USA TODAY for comment.Fact check: What's true and what's false about coronavirus?The common cold and COVID-19 testsThis isn't the first time internet users have alleged a link between the common cold and positive COVID-19 tests. USA TODAY debunked a similar claim in July.Fact check: Common cold does not produce positive coronavirus testThe claim that the common cold will produce a positive COVID-19 test relates to antibody tests.Those check the blood for antibodies – disease-specific proteins produced by white blood cells to fight a virus – and reveal whether an individual had a past infection.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "a positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance that a positive result means you have antibodies from an infection with a different virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses)."It's true that the common cold is in the coronavirus family.Dr. Lee Riley – head of the Division of Infectious Disease and Vaccinology at the University of California, Berkley – confirmed to USA TODAY that "about a third of the common cold is caused by coronavirus strains that are distinct from the COVID-19 coronavirus."Still, he said, it's unlikely that having contracted the common cold would result in a positive test for COVID-19 antibodies."These common cold coronavirus strains would not induce an antibody response high enough to be mistaken for the antibody response against the COVID-19 virus," he wrote in an email. "If they did, almost everyone on the planet would be shown to have an antibody against COVID-19."Antibody tests are not intended for diagnostic purposes. Diagnoses are based on viral tests.According to the Food and Drug Administration, there are two kinds of viral tests for COVID-19 that can be used for diagnostic purposes: molecular tests and antigen tests.Molecular tests detect the virus’s genetic material, and antigen tests detect specific proteins from the virus.COVID-19 is a specific type of coronavirus with distinct genetic material and proteins.That's why the CDC notes on its site that "other coronaviruses cannot produce a positive result on a viral test for SARS-CoV-2."The flu, the flu shot and coronavirus testsThough some symptoms of the flu and COVID-19 are similar, the viruses are distinct. The flu is caused by an influenza virus, not a coronavirus.Riley told USA TODAY that claims about the flu and coronavirus tests are "nonsensical.""The influenza virus is very different from the COVID-19 virus and would never induce an antibody response that would be mistaken for the COVID-19 virus antibody," he wrote.Flu vaccines do not contain any types of coronaviruses, according to WUSA9.Having contracted the flu or received a flu vaccine will not produce a positive result on a diagnostic test for the novel coronavirus.A spokesperson for the FDA told FactCheck.org that all FDA-authorized tests for the coronavirus are specifically checked for cross-reactivity with influenza virus. They have not observed cross-reactivity with any of the tests.Dr. Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center, told USA TODAY that "no test for this virus can get approval if it gives false positives with other common respiratory viruses.""Part of the original validation procedure for all the approved tests was to check a number of other respiratory viruses, like influenza and the common human coronaviruses, to make sure they didn’t give false positives," he said.Morse emphasized that any positive test for the coronavirus should be taken seriously."Testing positive is convincing evidence that someone is infected and able to infect others," he wrote.Our rating: FalseBased on our research, the claim that the common cold, flu and flu vaccine will all result in positive tests for the novel coronavirus is FALSE. None will produce a positive result. Viral tests for the coronavirus detect its distinct genetic material or proteins – so other viruses won't cause false positives. It's possible that the common cold will produce a positive result in an antibody test, but those aren't used to diagnose COVID-19.Our fact check sources:USA TODAY, July 3, Fact check: Common cold does not produce positive coronavirus testCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Oct. 29, Test for Past InfectionDr. Lee Riley, Nov. 27, emailed statementFood and Drug Administration, Nov. 6, Coronavirus Disease 2019 Testing BasicsWUSA9, June 29, VERIFY: No, the flu shot won't make you test positive for COVID-19FactCheck.org, May 19, Flu Shot Doesn’t Cause False Positive Results for COVID-19Dr. Stephen Morse, Nov. 27, emailed statementThank you for supporting our journalism.

It is not the first pandemic to be caused by a respiratory virus and it is not likely to be the last. Influenza viruses are thought to have the potential to cause pandemics in the future. According to the World Health Organization, 2.9 lakh to 6.5 lakh deaths occur during every flu season. As such, strategies preventing and treating influenza virus infections have become a major area of research. There are four influenza viruses—A, B, C and D. Only A, B and C infect humans. C infections in humans are infrequent and mild. A and B infections can be severe, making them a public health problem. Influenza viruses have a single-stranded segmented RNA genome. Influenza A and B have eight genes, each encoding for a different protein essential for the virus’s ability to infect and reproduce in humans. Out of these eight proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are on the surface of the virus. HA is responsible for entry of the virus into our respiratory system. After replication, the new viral particles are released from the infected cell with the help of NA. Our immune system clears the infection by making antibodies. However, these antibodies are specific to the HA or NA and will either provide only partial protection or no protection against an influenza virus with different HA or NA. Influenza A viruses cause both pandemics and seasonal influenza virus epidemics. Influenza A viruses are categorised into subtypes based on what HA and NA they have. There are 18 distinct HAs and 11 NAs found in nature, and, theoretically, viruses with any combinations of these are possible. For example, Influenza A H1N1 has type 1 HA and type 1 NA. Only two influenza A subtypes—H1N1 and H3N2—cause seasonal influenza. The other subtypes are found in birds, poultry, swine and other mammals, and these subtypes occasionally infect humans causing severe disease. Subtypes are further divided into strains, which means there are many strains of H1N1 influenza A virus, each different from the other. This is based on differences in their HA. It is significant to note that all influenza virus pandemics till date have been caused by the influenza A subtype H1N1. Similarly, influenza B viruses are divided into two lineages—B/Yamagata-like and B/Victoria-like. The classification is based on the difference in their HA. These lineages are further divided into strains. Viruses from both lineages cause seasonal influenza epidemics. Influenza B viruses are only found in humans and seals and have not been known to cause pandemics, yet. Symptoms of seasonal influenza usually start one to four days after exposure. The symptoms are similar to Covid-19 and the common cold. However, most people with the flu show symptoms within two days, as compared to around five days for Covid-19. The symptoms last about five to seven days and usually self-resolve. However, in some cases, there can be complications such as inflammation of the heart, brain and muscles, multiple organ failure, and pneumonia, which could all lead to death. Children below the age of five (especially those below two) and those above 65, people with a weak immune system or chronic diseases like asthma, diabetes and heart disease, and pregnant women are more likely to be at risk for severe complications. It is estimated that a person infected with seasonal influenza infects at least one other person. The transmission is mainly through droplets, aerosols and fomites. Aerosols are smaller than droplets and can stay in the air close to half an hour. Most healthy individuals who get infected with seasonal influenza recover without medications. Higher risk individuals are treated with influenza antivirals such as oseltamivir, which inhibits the action of the NA. These influenza antivirals can decrease the chances of complications and shorten the duration of disease by about two days. However, our best defence against the seasonal influenza virus is vaccines. The effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccines to prevent disease is between 40 per cent and 60 per cent, depending on the virus strains circulating that season. The vaccine needs to be updated every year because of continuous mutations in the virus RNA. These mutations accumulate over time and modify the HA and NA of the virus. This is called antigenic drift. Influenza A viruses mutate at a faster rate than the influenza B viruses, but antigenic drift occurs in both. The vaccine, if not updated to include the mutated virus, will not work as well or not at all that season. The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System selects the strains that will be included in influenza vaccine for the north and south hemisphere each year. The selection of strains is based on surveillance data of influenza virus infections in over 106 countries for about four to six months before the influenza virus season. The seasonal influenza virus vaccines are not effective against pandemic influenza viruses. Pandemic influenza viruses are novel. There is little to no pre-existing immunity against these viruses because they have a genome mixed with genes of animal origin. For example, the 2009 Influenza A H1N1 pandemic virus or swine flu, has genes from seasonal influenza A H3N2 and genes from influenza A H1N1 viruses found in birds and pigs. This mixing of genes is called antigenic shift. Antigenic shift occurs when two or more influenza viruses infect a host at the same time, leading to recombination of their genes into an influenza virus with a novel HA and/or NA. This is known to have happened only in influenza A viruses. The current flu vaccine needs to be replaced by a more protective vaccine with long-term immunity. Research into a universal influenza vaccine has been ongoing. The goal is to find a region of the virus that elicits a protective immune response against multiple influenza A strains. A universal flu vaccine is a step in the right direction. Current flu vaccines, with their varying effectiveness and limited protection, need to be improved. Covid-19 taught us the importance of pandemic preparedness and the value of vaccines. It is prudent to plan for an influenza virus pandemic and continue research into vaccines that can protect against influenza strains with pandemic-causing potential.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Within minutes of news that crew members of the cargo ship Fesco Askold had tested positive for COVID-19, a social media storm broke across Samoa. COVID-free until then, the island nation’s anxiety was understandable. More so when you consider its history. Memories of the deadly 2019 measles outbreak were still fresh. But more distant events resonated just as much. Next to images of the cargo ship in the harbour, people were posting pictures of the Talune, the infamous “ship of death” that brought the Spanish influenza virus to Samoa in 1918, devastating the population. The Fesco Askold had docked in Apia, Samoa, on November 7, before sailing to Pago Pago in American Samoa, where the crew apparently tested positive. Panic increased when a hoax email claimed a school child was a direct contact of a port worker and all parents should immediately collect their children. The government later corrected the arrival date of the cargo ship in Apia to November 8. None of the crew had left the ship and there was no contact between them and Samoan harbour pilots. Offloaded containers had been sterilised. The crisis passed, but within weeks another positive COVID-19 test was reported in a quarantined sailor who had arrived in Samoa on a repatriation flight from New Zealand on November 13. When further tests showed negative results, swabs were sent to Wellington for more analysis. When these were inconclusive, blood samples were sent, with results still pending. Meanwhile, a chartered flight from the US was due to arrive in Samoa with up to half of the 300 passengers returning sailors. The flight was postponed this week. Two more repatriation flights from New Zealand scheduled for early December are still to be confirmed. The SS Talune docked in Apia in 1918, bringing the Spanish flu to Samoa. Alexander Turnbull Library, CC BY-NC The influenza and measles tragedies Both New Zealand and Samoa are highly sensitive to the risks of disease spreading. The Talune was quarantined in Fiji in 1918, but no such precautions were taken in Samoa, then under New Zealand administration. Infected passengers were allowed to disembark. Over a fifth of the Samoan population died as a result. In 2002, the then New Zealand prime minister, Helen Clark, made a formal apology in person to the people of Samoa for the grievous error of a past government. But in 2019 a measles epidemic that began in New Zealand rocked Samoa, killing 83, nearly all young children. Official inaction by New Zealand was blamed for the tragedy. Read more: Buying and distributing a COVID-19 vaccine will involve hard ethical and practical choices While Aotearoa New Zealand has done well controlling COVID-19, Samoa is not nearly as well resourced. Health facilities and expert staff are stretched at best. Furthermore, there are many existing health problems, making the population particularly vulnerable to the virus. Pictures from other countries of mass graves being prepared for COVID-19 victims trigger traumatic memories in Samoa. Many were buried in this way in 1918 — and even more recently after the devastating 2009 tsunami. My own family was not spared in what is known as the great Faamai — plague — of 1918. One of my great grandfathers and one of my great, great grandfathers died — two generations in one event. For Samoans, as for all Pasifika people and Māori, a mass grave is particularly soul-destroying. To be buried without identification and acknowledgement of who the dead are, and their many familial connections, goes against custom and culture. Samoans mark every rite of passage from the womb to the tomb. This is the basis of our communal structure, embedded in the customs and practices of the Faamatai — more commonly known as the Faa-Samoa or “the Samoan way”. Volunteers and aid workers in Apia, Samoa, during the measles vaccination campaign in 2019. GettyImages The lasting effects of 1918 The impact of the 1918 epidemic is also still felt in the laws and political systems of Samoa. In the Land and Titles Court, for example, people represent themselves in an inquisitorial forum reflecting Samoa’s history as a German colony from 1900-1914. Since 1918, it is not unusual to hear (or read in written petitions) a heartbreaking phrase: Ua tuua ia tama lenei aiga — in our family only the children remained. For many Samoan families the tragedy resulted in the loss of matai (chiefly) titles and the customary lands owned by those names. The fight by later generations to reclaim their heritage has, rightly or wrongly, given the court its contemporary power, influence and value. Read more: New cyclone forecasts: why impacts should be the focus of hazardous weather warnings Right now, Samoans are preparing for a general election in April 2021. The government’s handling of the pandemic is likely to play a major part in campaigning and voting. As a recent Newsline Samoa opinion column was headlined: COVID-19 is a Deadly Virus Not an Election Winner. Given the current situation and the country’s history, the panic of November 9 was to be expected. Prayers and pleas that this latest plague will pass over Samoa and spare its people are still on the lips of every Samoan, whether they live there or elsewhere. They know their country could not withstand the ravages of COVID-19 should it reach their shores. In Samoa, 1918 is not a distant memory.

As you may already be hearing, this year’s immunization options have changed. All Albertans, six months of age and older, are still eligible to be immunized, free of charge; however, this year, Alberta Health Services (AHS) is working with pharmacists and physicians to offer immunization to different age groups and demographics. The easiest way for most Albertans to get immunized is to call a local pharmacy or doctor’s office. AHS clinics are offering influenza immunization to those under five years of age and their immediate families or household members, only. Appointments are required for AHS clinics, and can easily be booked online at https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/influenza/influenza.aspx , or by calling 811. Individuals who do not have a provincial health care number, or who live in a community where there are no other immunizing health care providers aside from AHS, can call 811 to book an immunization through AHS. No community will be without the protection of influenza immunization. Alberta Health Services is here to support you, your friends, family, colleagues and neighbours in getting immunized. Masking and physical distancing practices continue to be in place at all immunization locations. We remind all Albertans: please don’t attend an immunization appointment if you are feeling unwell. If you are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 please isolate at home and visit ahs.ca/covid to complete the AHS online self-assessment and book a test for COVID-19 if recommended.

There have been no influenza related deaths in the state since September 1.From November 15-21, 2020 the percentage of outpatient visits meeting the criteria for an influenza-like illness was 2.8%, or 145 out of 5234.3.2%, 110 out of 3461 of rapid influenza tests performed by sentinel sites were positive; 31% were influenza A. This is down from 41% the prior week. 0.1%, 1 out of 1256, of RSV tests performed by sentinel laboratories were positive, down from last week.

The OSDH wants to remind Oklahomans that everyone is at risk for influenza and the flu vaccination is recommended for anyone 6 months of age and older. Clinics at county health departments are stocked with regular flu vaccine and high-dose vaccine for those over the age of 65. The CDC said, “There are some key differences between flu and COVID-19. COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. Another important difference is there is a vaccine to protect against flu. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus.” The CDC also said that it is possible to have COVID-19 and the flu at the same time. Most people have likely had the flu at some point – with symptoms such as a constant cough, sore throat, a runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headaches and fatigue – yet many myths and misperceptions remain. Here are five myths and facts that can help you and your loved ones reduce the risk of catching the flu. Many of the symptoms are similar to that of COVID-19 and the only way to determine the illness is through testing. 0 Comments Be the first to know Get local news delivered to your inbox!

As many as 17 million people died in India alone, while it is estimated that one fifth of the population of Iran was killed – up to 5 per cent of the world’s population perished.It arrived on UK shores at around the same time as soldiers returned at the end of the war, and went on to infect around a quarter of the nation’s population and kill 250,000 people.Why was Spanish Flu so lethal?Recent scientific research has suggested that the specific H1N1 variant of influenza involved in Spanish Flu was no more aggressive than previous strains.Instead, the appalling death toll has been attributed to the circumstances created by WWI, such as overcrowded, unhygienic hospitals and widespread global travel, which helped the disease to spread with devastating speed.Beyond the tens of millions of dead, the Spanish Flu also exerted a serious economic toll, with communities struck down and left unable to work by the debilitating disease.After building to a terrible peak with its second wave, the pandemic ended relatively abruptly, with one theory holding that its lethality caused the virus to mutate to a less deadly strain.Although there have been further serious flu pandemics, Spanish Flu remains the most serious in history, with a death toll and global impact comparable to the Black Death.TopicsFluInsightMost Read By SubscribersEditor's PicksCrimeInvestigationCash collections for homeless veterans probed by policePensions and RetirementNine in 10 pensioners say the state pension isn't enough to survive onNewsBig ReadHow Trump will turbocharge right-wing populism across EuropeMost PopularNewsNHS baby formula could save parents up to £700 a yearFoodFoods to eat for weight loss - and three you have to avoidOpinionThis isn’t just any defeat - it will need a huge Democrat reckoningNewsTrump advises Putin not to escalate Ukraine war in first phone call since victoryHealthExclusiveHospices 'crumbling' as charities fear Budget impact on end of life carePoliticsExclusive'Smash the Gangs won't work': Home Office officials doubt Labour small boats planFood And DrinkWhy you should eat fermented foods - and how to add them into your dietWorldIsrael warns of planned attacks at events in countries including UKNewsRita Ora makes emotional tribute to Liam Payne at MTV AwardsHealthNational Insurance rise gives GPs 'no choice but to cut services and staff'EssentialsNewsSportLifestyleCultureOpinionPuzzlesUseful linksContact UsAboutAdvertisei Print SubscriptionsiRewardsi appi Student Digital SubscriptionSitemapNewslettersSaved ArticlesManage accountFollow us onAll rights reserved. © 2024 Associated Newspapers Limited.Cookie SettingsDo not sell or share my personal informationTerms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicyBack to topWayback Wednesday - The similarities and differences between The Spanish Flu and COVID-19 — Modern Mississauga Media Modern Mississauga Media Local Arts Lifestyle Travel Food & Drink INTERACTIVE MAGAZINE Motoring Video Local/ Arts/ Lifestyle/ Travel/ Food & Drink/ INTERACTIVE MAGAZINE/ Motoring/ Video/ Main Local/ Arts/ Lifestyle/ Travel/ Food & Drink/ INTERACTIVE MAGAZINE/ Motoring/ Video/ November 25, 2020 Wayback Wednesday - The similarities and differences between The Spanish Flu and COVID-19 November 25, 2020/ Matthew Wilkinson, Historian at Heritage Mississauga Here we go again. Lockdown. And searching for positives in difficult times. Although the timeline for the development and roll-out of a vaccine for COVID-19 remains uncertain, we received a glimmer of hope over the past week or so with the news of potential vaccines on the horizon. This had me pondering what happened 100 years ago in the battle against the Spanish Flu. Spanish Flu Cartoon There are certainly some strong similarities between the Spanish Flu and COVID-19: health care professionals, then and now, faced a virus they did not know much about; both viruses are strains of coronavirus and have similar symptoms; both presented as new, or novel, viruses meaning there were/are no vaccines or immunities. Eerily the timelines are very similar: most were not fearful at first, but the virus expanded exponentially, infecting hundreds, then thousands, then millions around the world. Closures and social isolations followed, and both in 1918 and in 2020, the pieces began to fall – bans of public gatherings, professional sports leagues closed down, as did non-essential businesses, schools, churches, theatres, clubs, parks and playgrounds. Hospital visiting hours were abolished and personal care homes were closed to all visitors. Quarantine wards were established in hospitals, and temporary hospitals were organized to meet the need.There are some differences as well: closures in 1918 were not complete – and technology did not exist to support large segments of the population working from home or with online schooling, as we see today. There was no universal health care during the Spanish Flu pandemic. Today, in the face of COVID-19, the provincial and federal governments are playing a much more active and vital role in directing and assisting Canadians than was the case 100 years ago. Much of the fight against the Spanish Flu was at the local level, led by the local Medical Officer of Health. The World Health Organization was formed in 1948, and as such there was nothing to advise governments, help them with their responses, or facilitate the sharing of vital information and resources. 100 years ago countries and communities were largely on their own to address the challenges. In Canada, the federal Department of Health (now Health Canada) was created in 1919 as a result of the Spanish Flu pandemic. Doctors and nurses in Toronto, 1918 It is estimated that 1 in 6 Canadian contracted the Spanish Flu, and approximately 55,000 died between 1918 and 1920, making the loss of life in the pandemic on par with the losses in the First World War.The Spanish Flu came in what has been described as waves, similar in some ways to what we see today with COVID-19. Although most analysis would suggest that the term “waves” is inaccurate – rather that the virus responded to human actions – restrictions and measures enacted in response to the pandemic reduced the impact, but with the relaxing of the restrictions, exposures and infections increased. Simple cause and effect.Although its origins are uncertain, and information was often suppressed during the war, the pandemic likely came to Canada with returning soldiers. It was first noted in Canada in the Spring and Summer of 1918, but its deadliest form roared through with the so-called second wave in the Fall of 1918, followed by subsequent “waves” in Spring of 1919. Then, as sudden as it arrived, it faded. Locally there were still sporadic cases into 1920, but the virus generally dissipated on its own terms, without a vaccine, leaving death, social upheaval, and economic disruptions in its wake. To say the least, it was a long, hard 2 ½ years, and even then the virus remained. And it has never left us. Traces of the same virus have been found in other flu viruses. The Spanish flu virus continues to appear, mutating and acquiring genetic material from other viruses. But vaccines were developed in the 1940s and 1950s to combat it. An annual “flu shot” has become part of a regular health routine for millions of people. Hospital image, Spanish Flu The recent news of potential vaccines for COVID-19 highlights another striking difference between yesteryear and today. From “A History of Vaccines”:“A few vaccines to prevent other diseases were available at the time -- smallpox vaccine had, of course, been used for more than 100 years; Louis Pasteur had developed rabies vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis after an encounter with a rabid animal; typhoid fever vaccines had been developed. Diphtheria antitoxin -- a medication made from the blood of previously infected animals -- had been used for treatment since the late 1800s; an early form of a diphtheria vaccine had been used; and experimental cholera vaccines had been developed. Manufacturers had developed and sold various mixed heat-killed bacterial stock vaccines of dubious usefulness. In terms of knowledge of influenza as an infectious disease, not a great deal was understood at the time. Many medical professionals thought that influenza was a specific communicable disease that presented seasonally, usually in the winter. Even so, without specific diagnostic tools, mild cases of influenza were difficult to distinguish from other acute respiratory illnesses. The tools of the time were only able to detect bacteria, not smaller pathogens … Certainly none of the vaccines prevented viral influenza infection – we know now that influenza is caused by a virus, and none of the vaccines protected against it … It was not until the 1930s that researchers established that influenza was in fact caused by a virus, not a bacterium …”In short, our medical experts known more today about combatting viruses than they did a hundred years ago. They can learn from the Spanish Flu, as they race to find a vaccine. We can learn as well, by following the advice of health professionals. It was hard then, just as it is hard now, and we all long for a return to “normal”. One day, a “COVID-shot” vaccine will also, we can all hope, become part of our new normal.Speaking only for myself, the news of vaccine development has provided a glimmer of hope, of a light at the end of the tunnel. The “end” of COVID-19 may still be a long way off, but if the Spanish Flu can provide a map, it shows us the need to collectively remain vigilant and aware that this road has many ups and downs, and we are only part of the way into this journey. But we will get there, together. We will emerge, in time. This too shall pass.

According to the letter, the measure is aimed at protecting the country against avian influenza that appeared in recent weeks in some European and Asian countries. The measure falls in line with the recommendation issued by the Cameroonian Poultry Interprofessional Organization (IPAVIC). Indeed, in a recent interview with the government daily Cameroon Tribune, François Djonou (President of the IPAVIC) suggested poultry farmers should “immediately” stop importing hatching eggs and other day-old chicks from European countries and Nigeria. "It is better to have empty farms than to have the virus. I wrote a message in the farmers' forum (...) asking for a cessation of poultry products’ importation,” he said. Let’s note that a few days earlier, the government had strengthened sanitary inspections at the borders following the outbreak of avian influenza in Western countries such as Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Russia, and Israel.
