Vaccine Acquisition and Distribution: The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) manages the annual flu vaccine program for the Department of Defense (DOD). Three contracts have been awarded for a total of 3.4 million doses of the influenza vaccine, with shipments expected to begin in August ahead of the 2022-2023 flu season. The awards will meet the needs of warfighters and eligible dependents worldwide.

Early Action and Teamwork: The success of the flu vaccine program is attributed to early action and collaboration among DLA partners. The acquisition process started earlier, similar to the previous year, allowing for a steady "battle rhythm" of communication and collaboration with distribution partners. This approach has been deemed the most successful season by the DLA Troop Support Pharmaceutical Manufacturer and Distributor Division Chief.

Vaccine Supply and Flexibility: The three awarded contracts, with a total minimum value of $35.3 million, ensure that Defense Health Agency facilities worldwide will have the influenza vaccines available before the flu season begins. The contracts also provide flexibility to support emerging requirements, such as the 2021 Afghan Medical support mission.

Communication and Collaboration: Good communication and collaboration between DLA Distribution, commercial carriers, and DLA Troop Support Medical team have been essential in ensuring the safe and timely delivery of the vaccines to their destinations, despite the impacts of COVID-19 on the nation.
