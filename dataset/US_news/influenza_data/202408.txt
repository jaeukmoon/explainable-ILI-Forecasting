The announcement was made at an information session after a 4-day meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines. The meeting is held twice annually, once for the southern and once for the northern hemisphere. WHO organizes these consultations with an advisory group of experts gathered from WHO Collaborating Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories to analyse influenza virus surveillance data generated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The recommendations issued are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce, and license influenza vaccines for the following influenza season. The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, including those circulating and infecting humans.The WHO recommends that trivalent vaccines for use in the 2024-2025 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following: Egg-based vaccinesan A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;an A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.Cell culture- or recombinant-based vaccinesan A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;an A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus; anda B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.For quadrivalent egg- or cell culture-based or recombinant vaccines for use in the 2024-2025 northern hemisphere influenza season, the WHO recommends inclusion of the following as the B/Yamagata lineage component:a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.

To reach the ultimate goal of a universal vaccine for seasonal influenza, a mosaic influenza nanoparticle vaccine (FluMos-v1) was developed for clinical trial (NCT04896086). FluMos-v1 is unique in that it is designed to co-display four recently circulating haemagglutinin (HA) strains; however, current vaccine analysis techniques are limited to nanoparticle population analysis, thus, are unable to determine the valency of an individual nanoparticle. For the first time, we demonstrate by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and supportive physical–chemical methods that the co-display of four antigens is indeed achieved in single nanoparticles. Additionally, we have determined percentages of multivalent (mosaic) nanoparticles with four, three, or two HA proteins. The integrated imaging and physicochemical methods we have developed for single nanoparticle multivalency will serve to further understand immunogenicity data from our current FluMos-v1 clinical trial.

The current seasonal flu vaccines target specific strains predicted to be prevalent each year. However, this approach requires constant monitoring, updating, and production of new vaccines to match the circulating strains. Development of “universal” vaccines would provide broader and longer-lasting protection against various influenza strains, reducing the need for annual updates.Most seasonal influenza vaccines target the viral envelope protein Hemagglutinin (HA). There are two major structurally defined antigenic supersites on HA for B cell receptors, one on the globular head region, and the other on the HA stem region1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The antibodies elicited by the supersites on the HA heads are primarily strain-specific, limited in protection breadth, and have high binding affinity. Alternatively, the stem supersites are conserved among strains, are the targets of cross-reactive antibodies, and do not have as strong affinity. The immunodominance of the HA head results in B cells with limited breadth against divergent influenza strains and represents a major challenge for developing broadly protective influenza vaccines.Approaches to subvert immunodominance of the HA head domain include chimeric hemagglutinin and mosaic hemagglutinin constructs10. The present work focuses on a different approach, a mosaic array of heterotypic influenza HA antigens co-presented on a single nanoparticle11. Following vaccination with a mosaic nanoparticle, B cells with cross-reactive B cell receptors capable of bivalent binding to neighboring heterologous antigen pairs can proliferate1. Studies also demonstrated that multivalent mosaic nanoparticle vaccines stimulated robust stem-directed antibody responses even in the context of strong pre-existing immunity against the immunodominant HA head11. The advantage of mosaic array antigens to enhance broadly neutralizing antibodies provides new possibilities of a broadly protective influenza vaccine.The heterotypic display of multiple influenza HA antigens is achieved by de novo design of self-assembling proteins12,13,14. Computationally designed two-component nanoparticles have been generated for HA, HIV Env antigens, and RSV proteins to enhance the antigen-elicited antibody titers during the adaptive immune response15,16,17,18. The FluMos-v1 mosaic nanoparticle vaccine19 is comprised of HA proteins from four strains, each with the same dn5B trimerization domain (HA-trimers, abbreviated as HAT) for multivalent surface co-presentation. The HA-trimers and dn5A pentamer proteins (core component of the nanoparticle) were produced and purified individually and assembled into nanoparticles in solution. The successful assembly of monovalent nanoparticles and the presence of four-strain HATs in the nanoparticle population has been demonstrated by EM, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, ELISA, etc.11. However, the presence of more than one different HA protein on a single nanoparticle and the distribution of HA proteins have not been determined. The analytical challenge is largely defined by the need to identify more than two components within a 50 nm diameter. Flow cytometry cannot detect the small size of nanoparticles; additionally, the signal intensity arising from small numbers of target proteins is below the limit of detection. The 50 nm diameter size is spatially limiting for antibody + gold particle-labeling with electron microscopy detection. The range of distinguishable gold particle sizes for conjugates (10–100 nm) is too large causing the potential for steric hinderance and an inability to differentiate multiple (four) different HA proteins20. To address this issue, we developed a straightforward method that employs labeling each of the four strains of HA-trimers on the FluMos-v1 nanoparticle with distinct fluorophores, applied total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM)21 to directly image individual nanoparticles and developed a simple computational method to assess the level of colocalized signal of each of the four HA-trimer types to determine particle valency. Uniquely featured with low background fluorescence, TIRFM enabled the fluorescence detection at the single nanoparticle level and provided direct evidence of multivalency by imaging four HA proteins co-displayed on one nanoparticle via co-localization of four colors. Additionally, we report estimates of the frequency of mosaic nanoparticles formed with two, three, and four different HA proteins. The present work combined standard and innovative techniques to provide new avenues for the characterization of future multivalent nanoparticle vaccines.ResultsCharacterization of assembled FluMos-v1 nanoparticlesThe ~ 30 nm diameter Flumos-v1 nanoparticle vaccine is composed of 20 HA-dn5B trimers and 12 dn5A pentamers with four strains of influenza Hemagglutinin (H1, H3, HBv, and HBy) to display heterotypic HA trimers on the surface of the nanoparticle. The successful assembly of the influenza vaccine nanoparticle is demonstrated by electron microscopy and SEC. Cryo-EM 2D class averages and a 3D reconstruction at a resolution of 4.9 Å (Fig. 1A, left and right, respectively) confirm the symmetric configuration of the nanoparticle which is consistent with its icosahedral design. The particle’s symmetry suggested there would not be positional bias for Fab binding. The molar ratios of the four HA-trimers assembled into FluMos-v1 nanoparticles were predicted to be 1:1:1:1 based on the assembly condition of equimolar addition of the HA trimers. We previously experimentally confirmed the molar ratio by ELISA19 using four strain-specific monoclonal antibodies. For this study, we determined the molar ratio with three of the same monoclonal antibodies and with the MM09 antibody to HBy (Supplementary Figure S2) to be 1.0:1.1:1.1:1.0, consistent with equal molar distribution of the four HATs in FluMos-v1.Figure 1Overview of the structure and assembly of mosaic nanoparticle with influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigens.

The nanoparticles were combined with the H1 strain-specific monoclonal antibody m-H1 labeled with Dylight405 (TEM and SEC profile, bottom) or analyzed without the antibody (SEC profile, top). (D) Negative-stain TEM image (left) and SEC profiles (right) of monovalent H3 nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were combined with the H3 strain-specific Fab fragment F-H3 labeled with Dylight488 (TEM and SEC bottom profile) or analyzed without the Fab (SEC top). (E) Negative-stain TEM image (left), representative 2D class average (inset), and SEC profiles (right) of quadrivalent FluMos-v1 nanoparticles. On the right, SEC profiles are the tetravalent FluMos-v1 NP (top) and FluMos-v1 mixed with labeled Fabs.Full size imageA key consideration for single nanoparticle evaluation was the assessment of mono-dispersity of nanoparticles in solution. Negative-stain TEM of assembled FluMos-V1 nanoparticles revealed no aggregates, consistent with the SEC chromatogram (Fig. 1B). Additionally, the largest molecular weight peak corresponded to single nanoparticles, demonstrating the absence of aggregated particles. In contrast, solutions of nanoparticles bound to IgG monoclonals contained substantial amounts of aggregates which were evident as a broad high molecular weight peak in the SEC chromatogram (Fig. 1C). Monovalent HA nanoparticles bound to the Fab fragment of the IgG were monodisperse in TEM images, with no detectable high molecular weight SEC peak corresponding to aggregates of particles (Fig. 1D). Additionally, samples of quadrivalent FluMos-v1 nanoparticle with the four corresponding HA Fabs were 91% pure and without aggregates (Fig. 1E). Characterization of FluMos-V1 by negative-stain electron microscopy, SEC, and ELISA indicated that Fab binding did not induce aggregation and there was equimolar population-wide incorporation stoichiometry of the four HA proteins.Characterization of Fab Fluorescent labeling by mass spectrometryTo confirm multivalency of FluMos-v1 by microscopic imaging, the mAb binding partners of HA strains were chemically labeled with CF-405S, Dylight 488, Dylight 560, or Dylight 650 and enzymatically cleaved to generate fluorescently labeled Fabs. Using Fabs instead of IgGs mitigates potential for nanoparticle aggregation caused by the interaction of bivalent arms from one IgG with two nanoparticles. Labeling efficiency of the Fab fragments ranged from 10 to 75% as determined by MALDI-MS, and the majority of labeled Fabs carried one fluorophore (Table 1, Supplementary Figure S3). F-HBy was the least efficiently labeled Fab, with 10% of molecules having one label and 90% unlabeled. Therefore, most of the F-HBy Fab fragments binding to the nanoparticle will not have the fluorescent label, likely leading to inefficient detection of the B-Yamagata strain HA-trimer. Alternatively, Dylight 488 was used to label all four Fabs, with MALDI-MS analysis showing unlabeled Fabs and Fabs with up to three Dylight 488 tags for all four Fabs (Figure S4).Table 1 The relative abundance (percentage) of FLR labeled and unlabeled Fab determined by MALDI-MS and calculated from peak height (intensities).Full size tableConfirmation of equimolar content of the four HA trimers by SEC-fluorescence detectionThe utility of fluorescently labeled Fab fragments for detection of HA proteins incorporated into nanoparticles was determined by an SEC-fluorescence (SEC-FLR) method. Equal molar amounts of CF405S-F-H1, D550-F-H3, D488-F-HBv, and D650-F-HBy were pre-mixed, incubated with FluMos-v1, and buffer-exchanged into FluMos-v1 formulation buffer. The FLR-Fab and FluMos-v1 combination was analyzed in separate SEC runs at the excitation/emission wavelength of each fluorophore (Fig. 2). The main peak at retention time ~ 3.5 min of the FluMos-v1/FLR-Fab complex confirms the presence of each fluorescently labeled Fab predominantly in complex with the nanoparticle. Fabs not bound to FluMos-v1 are evident as minor peaks. The SEC chromatograms of nanoparticle/FLR-Fab complexes confirm that the nanoparticles were labeled with the four fluorophores. Additionally, the largest molecular weight peak corresponded to single nanoparticles + Fabs, demonstrating the absence of aggregated Fabanoparticle complexes. As expected from the low labeling efficiency, the fluorescence intensity of D650-F-HBy was much lower than that of the other FLR-Fabs. Next, the molar ratio of H1, H3, HBv, and HBy was determined by SEC-FLR of nanoparticles bound to single D488-labeled Fabs. The theoretical maximum number of Fab binding sites for a single strain of HAT per nanoparticle are 60, 30, and 15 for monovalent, bivalent, and quadrivalent nanoparticles, resulting in a ratio of 4:2:1 if each strain was incorporated equally. For the determination of HA molar ratio, individual strain D488-labeled Fabs were complexed with monovalent, bivalent, and quadrivalent nanoparticles at Fab-to-nanoparticle ratios of 60:1, 40:1, and 20:1, respectively. Fabs were added in slight excess to saturate the epitopes on the nanoparticle while establishing conditions for subsequent measurement, as peaks corresponding to unbound Fabs were apparent in a preliminary experiment at Fab-to-nanoparticle ratios of 60:1, 40:1, and 20:1 (Supplementary Figure S5). The SEC-FLR chromatogram illustrates the fluorescence signal peaks (Ex493/Em518 nm) of Dylight 488-F-H3 complexed with H3 monovalent, H1/H3 bivalent, and H1/H3/HBv/HBy quadrivalent nanoparticles (Fig. 3). Experimental ratios of H3 HA-trimer in the nanoparticle samples were determined by dividing the normalized peak area of each nanoparticle by the normalized peak area of the quadrivalent nanoparticle. The FLR peak intensity ratios for the complexes of Fab with H3 monovalent, H1/H3 bivalent, and H1/H3/HBv/HBy quadrivalent nanoparticles were 3.9:2.2:1. The peak intensity ratios of the other three strains (H1, HBv, HBy) were approximately 4:2:1, with slight deviation for the HBy at 5:2:1 (Supplementary Table S1). The consistency of peak intensity ratios among H1, H3, HBv, and HBy demonstrates equal molar distribution of the four HA strains in the preparation of FluMos-v1, converging with the results obtained by LC-MS22 and ELISA19. The agreement between the three methods demonstrates the suitability of fluorescently labeled Fabs for HA detection.Figure 2SEC Analysis of FLR-Fab Labeling of the FluMos-v1 nanoparticle. FluMos-v1 labeled with a mixture of the four Fabs (F-H1, F-HBv, F-H3, and F-HBy) (top) or the four Fab mixtures without FluMos-v1 (bottom) were injected into the SEC column. Each chromatogram represents a different fluorescent channel corresponding to the FLR-Fab-specific fluorescent label as noted above each pair or chromatograms.Full size imageFigure 3 SEC-FLR of DyLight-488 F-H3 and nanoparticles assembled with the H3 HA-trimer (Monovalent), the H3 and H1 HA-trimers (Bivalent), or all four HA-trimers (quadrivalent FluMos-v1). Peak area ratios are noted by the arrows and represent the fluorescence signal intensity ratio of Fab-H3 detected in monovalent (green), bivalent (red) and quadrivalent (blue) nanoparticles, with the 1:1 ratio defined as the Fab-H3 peak area of the quadrivalent nanoparticle.Full size image Demonstration of multivalent individual nanoparticles via TIRF microscopy After confirming that FluMos-v1 nanoparticles were labeled with fluorescent Fab fragments, and that the overall population of quadrivalent assembled FluMos-v1 nanoparticles has roughly equivalent molar ratios of each HA trimer (Figs. 1D,E, 3, and22), the fluorescently labeled FluMos-v1 nanoparticles were next visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to demonstrate multivalency at the individual nanoparticle level. TIRFM is a well-established epi-fluorescence imaging technique that is used to excite fluorescent molecules in aqueous solution proximal (within ~ 100 nm) to the glass coverslip of an imaging chamber23. Because small fluorescent molecules, including unbound labeled Fab, suspended in solution are not excited by TIRFM, extremely high-contrast images of individual FluMos-v1 nanoparticles adhered to the glass coverslip could be captured and evaluated for multivalency. A solution of FluMos-v1 nanoparticles with each HA trimer targeted by the fluorescent Fab fragments was placed in wells with glass coverslip bottoms and imaged using a through-objective, inverted TIRF microscope and EMCCD camera (Fig. 4A). The majority of fluorescent spots observed in TIRFM images were considered individual nanoparticles based on the high degree of monomeric purity of the sample used for fluorescence imaging as shown by SEC of nanoparticles bound to the Fabs (Fig. 2) and further illustrated by negative stain EM. The latter method demonstrated that similarly prepared samples, although greater than 1000-fold more concentrated than for TIRFM, of FluMos-v1 or FluMos-v1 labeled with the four Fabs or D488-F-H3 appear as ~ 30 nm diameter dispersed monomeric nanoparticles with, at most, two to three nanoparticles in close proximity (Fig. 5). 2D classification of unlabeled FluMos-v1 nanoparticles and nanoparticles labeled with one and four Fabs produced progressively less well defined 2D class averages, reflecting increasing structural heterogeneity associated with Fabs binding to HATs of four different types randomly distributed on symmetrical nanoparticle cores. Importantly, individual HATs not complexed with nanoparticle cores were not observed by negative-stain TEM. The validity of HA-specific signal vs background was established by imaging the control samples containing singly- or doubly- labeled nanoparticles (Supplementary Figure S5). No signal was observed in channels where the HA trimer was not labeled. TIRFM demonstrated that individual quadrivalent assembled FluMos-v1 nanoparticles were observed with multiple colors, confirming that the population was indeed multivalent, but with varying fluorescent intensities. Because the Fab fragments used to target each of the four HA trimers carried a range of fluorescent dye molecules (Table 1), limited conclusions can be drawn from the observed intensity differences between nanoparticles in TIRFM images (Fig. 4A,B).Figure 4FluMos-v1 nanoparticles exhibit a high degree of multivalency. (A) FluMos-v1 nanoparticles were labeled with fluorescent Fab fragments corresponding to each of the four hemagglutinin strains, then diluted in formulation buffer and imaged via TIRF microscopy.

(C) Percentage of FluMos-v1 nanoparticles from all twenty FOVs in each valency category as determined by NIS-Elements-based analysis program.Full size imageFigure 5Negative-stain EM of FluMos-v1, FluMos-v1 complexed with four unlabeled Fabs, and FluMos-v1 complexed with D488-F-H3. Representative micrographs are shown along with representative 2D class averages.Full size imageTo analyze nanoparticle valency, we developed an algorithm to categorize the colors of more than sixteen thousand individual FluMos-v1 nanoparticles in the population imaged by TIRFM (Fig. 4C). Localizations were established via local maxima determination above a threshold set by examination of singly- and doubly labeled control nanoparticles (Supplementary Figure S5). Localizations with weak signal intensity in any given channel were included in the analysis if a fluorescent signal was detected for at least one other color in the same localization. However, localizations of only one color with weak signal intensity were assumed to be dissociated HA trimers and were excluded from the analysis, as true monovalent nanoparticles should be of greater intensity relative to multivalent nanoparticles with the same color.Impressively, TIRFM image analysis (Fig. 4C) revealed that a plurality (44.2%) of the FluMos-v1 nanoparticle population is indeed quadrivalent, with a nearly equivalent percentage (43.7%) of trivalent nanoparticles of varying types (percentage of each population of nanoparticles is summarized in Table S2 corresponding to Fig. 4A and C). For trivalent nanoparticles (those lacking signal from one fluorescently labeled Fab), H3-HBv-HBy, H1-HBv-HBy, H1-H3-HBy, and H1-H3-HBv made up 8.3%, 1.8%, 1.7%, and 31.9% of the total population respectively. It is important to highlight that the largest percentage of trivalent nanoparticles (31.9%) were those lacking signal from F-HBy Fab fragment (magenta). As stated, the highest level of fluorescent labeling obtainable for F-HBy was 10% (Table 1), indicating that the true number of quadrivalent FluMos-v1 nanoparticles was likely undercounted. Three independent preparations of quadrivalent assembled FluMos-v1 nanoparticles imaged by TIRFM showed an average measurement of 43.7% (2.9% STD) nanoparticle/Fab complexes excitable at all four fluorescent wavelengths.DiscussionGeneral conclusionsOur study demonstrates that FluMos-v1 nanoparticles are predominantly quadrivalent. Imaging by TIRFM allowed direct visualization of the co-localization of HA trimers from multiple strains, and imaging of more than 10 thousand nanoparticles revealed individual nanoparticles with four, three, two and one color. In support of the single nanoparticle visualization by TIRFM, electron microscopy and SEC provided clear evidence for single-particle dispersion in solution, thus excluding the possibility of the multi-color TIRFM species corresponding to aggregates of nanoparticles. Color distribution analysis of TIRFM data of these nanoparticles demonstrated that 44% are quadrivalent nanoparticles. As Fab dye-labeling efficiency differed for the four Fabs, and fluorescently labeled and unlabeled Fabs were equally capable of binding to the HAs on FluMos-v1 (Supplementary Figure S1), the population of 43.6% of tri-labeled nanoparticles likely includes quadrivalent nanoparticles wherein the fourth HA was not labeled with a fluorescently tagged Fab (MALDI-MS data for the labeling efficiency in Supplementary Figure S3). In particular, the proportion of tri-labeled nanoparticles lacking signal for the Hby HA, 31.9%, is substantially higher than the proportion of other tri-labeled nanoparticles, ranging from 1.8 to 8.3%. The D650-F-Hby Fab was labeled at the lowest efficiency of all the Fabs, at only 10%, whereas the other Fabs were labeled with greater than 50% efficiency (MALDI-MS data for the labeling efficiency in Supplementary Figure S3). Taken together, it is likely that a significant proportion of the 31.9% of tri-labeled nanoparticles lacking signal from the labeled Hby Fab were bound to unlabeled Hby Fab and the actual proportion of quadrivalent nanoparticles is significantly greater than the measured 44%.The assembly of FluMos-v1 as a 120-subunit icosahedral complex is a highly cooperative process24 driven by non-covalent interactions of two constituent protein building blocks, HA-dn5B trimer and dn5A pentamer. Previous work24 demonstrated that assembly process with multiple HA-trimers was more efficient than for monovalent particles. For example, Hby- and HBv- trimers had higher assembly efficiencies into heterologous nanoparticles in the presence of H1- or H3-trimers. Thus, the estimate that a minimum of 44% of individual nanoparticles had all four HA-dn5B trimers is consistent with these observations on assembly efficiency. The spatial distribution and copy number of the four HA components on nanoparticles remain to be determined. However, our analysis of single particles showed that in the population of Flumos-v1, nearly 90% of nanoparticles are quadrivalent and trivalent.Considerations for other imaging and detection technologiesGiven the increased use of nanoparticles as vaccine vehicles to deliver antigens to induce a potent long-lasting immune response11, it would be of interest for production laboratories to easily and rapidly appreciate antigen valency at the level of individual nanoparticles to complement a population analysis. To this end, we asked a very simple question: Can the valency of an individual nanoparticle be assessed by a fluorescence imaging technique, namely TIRFM, that is straightforward enough to work in the hands of a researcher with only general imaging experience? The techniques we employed allowed us to determine that quadrivalent nanoparticles were assembled through a simple co-localization imaging experiment that required about an hour of imaging time and a similar amount of time for analysis. While the objects we imaged were indeed diffraction-limited, we did not require any specialized super-resolution methodology for acquisition or analysis. Our method accommodates the need for rapid and robust analysis, while quantifying how many HA trimer species reside on a single multivalent nanoparticle is beyond our scope.SRM encompasses a variety of fluorescence imaging techniques that enable investigators to break the so-called diffraction-limit of optical microscopy, thereby, allowing objects that could only be resolved at ~ 300 nm in x–y space by standard imaging modalities to be discriminated in space at distances of ~ 120 nm down to 10 nm depending on the technique used. Excellent reviews can be found on how these techniques work and the types of questions that can be addressed with them25,26,27. Clearly, it is beyond the scope of this article to make direct comparisons with these techniques; however, it is critical to highlight that SRM techniques have been eloquently employed to study protein localization on viral particles and nanoparticles, providing interesting insights into protein localization and interpretations of function28,29,30,31. A main limitation of these techniques is the expertise and specialized equipmenteagents required for their implementation; furthermore, it is important to note that certain SRM fluorescence techniques are limited in the number or type of fluorophores that can be easily used in a single experiment, which would be prohibitive to employ in this present study. In the same vein, specialized techniques like fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), Raman spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offer potential alternative modalities to study the composition of self-assembling nanoparticles.FLIM measures the time a fluorophore persists in an excited state before releasing a photon that is, in turn, counted by a specialized detector to produce a lifetime decay curve32,33. The lifetime of a fluorophore is a unique signature and can be used to discriminate the presence of different colored fluorophores in space (as in an image). However, fluorescence lifetime can be affected (decreased) by quenching due to a chemical change or the proximity of another fluorophore such as seen in Forster resonance energy transfer—which is a real consideration for nanoscale objects. While FLIM is a modality that potentially can identify multiple fluorophores of varying colors on a single nanoparticle, detecting single particles is still necessary and would likely need to be coupled with total internal reflection illumination to provide the necessary contrast, a coupling which is technologically challenging and has rarely been implemented34.Raman spectroscopy encompasses a variety of methodologies that are used to fingerprint biological molecules. The technique is based on the principle that when light is incident on molecules (in solution or on a substrate) it scatters both elastically (Rayleigh scattering), maintaining its frequency, or inelastically, where the frequency (and energy) of the scattered light either decreases (Stokes Raman scattering) or increases (Anti-Stokes Raman scattering). While the Raman signal produced is tiny and needs to be filtered away from the dominant Rayleigh scattered light, it is unique, thus providing an identifiable signature for the molecules under study. Raman spectroscopy has been used to characterize viral proteins, diagnose the presence of viruses in cells, and to study the viral life cycle35. One technique in particular, tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) has been used to discriminate viral types36 and may be an intriguing alternative method to determine the valency of FluMos-v1 and similar nanoparticulate vaccine vehicles. TERS employs a probe that is scanned across a sample supported on a flat substrate analogous to how a cantilevered tip is used in atomic force microscopy. The probe, thereby, provides spatial resolution on top of the Raman signal and has been used successfully to differentiate flu from coxsackie virus36.While highly specialized, requiring advanced technical skills and equipment, Cryo-EM is another potential methodology for determining nanoparticle valency. Cryo-EM has advanced significantly over recent years and improved methods in sample preparation, equipment and data analysis/artifact removal have made it possible to exquisitely visualize the fine features of viruses and even biomolecules37,38. If the 3D structure of each HA trimer can be distinguished by this technique, it would then eliminate the time-consuming process of developing and labeling quality anti-HA monoclonal antibodies for fluorescence microscopy. However, the expertise and expense required by this method remains a consideration.SignificanceIn conclusion, the major advantage of a mosaic influenza nanoparticle vaccine over cocktails of monovalent nanoparticles is the broadly neutralizing activity against multiple viral strains by elicitation of cross-reactive B-cells to generate cross-reactive antibodies. The demonstration of predominantly multivalent particles in the FluMos-v1 vaccine is critical for supporting the concept of a mosaic vaccine rather than a mixture of monovalent or bi-valent nanoparticles. The methods employed here, SEC, ELISA, electron microscopy, and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), are broadly applicable to any complex nanoparticle approach for vaccines and therapeutics. The strategies developed in this study not only shed light on the characteristics of the assembly at the single nanoparticle level but will help further our understanding of the relationships between the structure and the clinical trial data (NCT04896086).Material and methodsAbbeviationInfluenza strains, monoclonal antibodies (mAb), F(ab) fragments (Fab), and their abbreviations are in Table 2.Table 2 Influenza strains and antibodies used in the study.Full size tableMaterialsQuadrivalent FluMos-v1, monovalent, bivalent, and trivalent nanoparticles39, HA-trimer, Pentamer, and their formulation buffers were produced/prepared at the VPP.

CF405-S Fluorescent labeling kit was purchased from Biotium (Catalog number 92211). FabALACTICA Fab kits were purchased from Genovis (AK-AFK-025). Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters were purchased from Millipore (Ultracel 100k, UFC510096). Sodium phosphate monobasic (monohydrate) and sodium phosphate dibasic (heptahydrate) was purchased from JT Baker (Catalog number 3802-01, and 3803-01, respectively).MethodsFluorescence labeling with DyLight fluorophores. mAbs were chemically labeled with fluorophore DyLight 488, DyLight 550, and DyLight 650 by adding 40μL of the borate buffer (0.67 M) to 0.5 mL of mAb solution at 2 mg/mL in PBS. Then 0.5 mL of the prepared mAb were added to the vial of DyLight reagent, vortexed and briefly centrifuged to collect the sample in the bottom of the tube. The reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min at room temperature with protection from light.Fluorescence labeling with CF405S. mAb 1H01 was chemically labeled with fluorophore CF405S. 100 µL of 1 M sodium bicarbonate pH 8.3 is added to the 900 µL of 1.0 mg antibody solution. A vial of CF405S dye was equilibrated to room temperature, and then 25 µL anhydrous DMSO was added to the dye vial. The vial was vortexed and then briefly centrifuged to collect the dye solution at the bottom of the vial. The dye stock was then mixed with the antibody solution prepared in the first step. The antibody/dye solution was protected from light by wrapping in aluminum foil. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. The labeled protein was stored at 4° C in the dark.Fab fragment generation. Fluorescently labeled mAbs were cleaved above the hinge region by IgdE enzyme to generate the DyLight- and CF405S-labeled Fabs. The fluorescently labeled mAbs were buffer exchanged into 150 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 using 7 kDa MWCO Zeba column (Thermo Scientific catalog number 89882). The digestion was performed at room temperature overnight. After incubation with immobilized FabALACTICA resin the fragments were then collected by centrifugation and buffer exchanged into PBS buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The Fab fragments were subsequently separated from the Fc by incubating the digest using the CaptureSelect™ Fc column(s) with multi-species Fc affinity resin at room temperature for 30–45 min. The pure Fab fragments were then collected by a centrifugation step. Fluorescent labeling did not change the binding profiles of the Fabs or their EC-50 values (Supplementary Figure S1).SEC (Size exclusion chromatography). The samples were loaded onto an SEC column (Sepax, SRT SEC-1000 PN: 215950-7815, 7.8 × 150 mm, 5 um) and analyzed by UPLC (Waters Acquity H-Class) with fluorescence (Ex278/Em330, Ex404/431, Ex493/516, Ex562/576, Ex652/672 nm) and UV (280 nm, 215 nm) detection. Mosaic nanoparticles complexed with Fabs or fluorescently labeled-Fabs were eluted by 2xPBS in an isocratic gradient over 12 min, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. For SEC-FLR, the total areas of the main peak of the nanoparticle + florescent-Fab complex were determined by Empower software. To calculate the ratios of peak areas for the nanoparticle in complex with the D488-labeled Fabs, the area under the main peaks at the D488 channel (Ex493/Em518 nm) and intrinsic fluorescence channel (Ex278/Em330nm) were separately integrated. The main peak areas at 493/518 nm were multiplied by a normalization factor determined from the intrinsic fluorescence peaks (Eq. 1) to compensate for differences in nanoparticle concentrations loaded onto the SEC column.Equation 1: Normalization factor.$${\text{f}} = \frac{{{\text{Main Peak Area}}_{{{\text{Ex278}}/{\text{Em33}}0}} {\text{of monovalent nanoparticle}}/{\text{Fab complex}}}}{{{\text{Main Peak Area}}_{{{\text{Ex278}}/{\text{Em33}}0}} {\text{of the selected nanoparticle}}/{\text{Fab complex}}}}$$ (1) Fab – nanoparticle complex formation. For monovalent, bivalent, and quadrivalent influenza nanoparticles, the Dylight/CF405S-labeled Fabs were incubated with the nanoparticle on a Jitterbug-4 benchtop shaker (Boekel Scientific, Catalog number 270440) for 30 min, at 350 rpm and 38 °C. Samples were then centrifuged at 11,000 rpm, 2–3 min, for 3 times with Amicon Ultra 100 k centrifugal filters to remove unbound fluorescent-Fabs and buffer exchanged into formulation buffer (20 mM Acetate Phosphate, 280 mM NaCl, 5% sucrose, 2.5% sorbitol, 0.01% PF68, pH 5.7) or 1xPBS buffer. For samples tested in the SEC-fluorescence detection method for confirmation of equimolar content of the four HA trimers, no centrifugation step was performed.ELISA. Nunc MaxiSorp plates (VWR, Catalog 62409-024) were coated with 10 µg/mL of Lectin from Galanthus nivalis (snowdrop) (Millipore Sigma, Catalog L8275) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. FluMos-v1 nanoparticle samples were serially diluted in fourfold steps and added to the wells for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking. Strain-specific mAb/Fab prepared at 2 µg/mL was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-human (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Catalog 109-035-003), prepared at 1:60,000 dilution, was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with shaking. The color product was developed with 3,3′,5′,5-tetramethylbenzidine (Ultra-TMB) substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog 34028), and reaction was stopped by adding TMB stop solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog N600). The optical signal was measured by absorbance at 450 nm with a Spectramax plate reader (Molecular Devices, MV 02861).Reverse phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Mobile phase A (MPA) was composed of LC–MS grade water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Thermo, 28904). Mobile phase B (MPB) was composed of 75% LC–MS grade acetonitrile (Burdick & Jackson, LC015-1), 20% Isopropanol (IPA) (J.T. Baker, 9083-01), 5% water, and 0.085% TFA. The gradient (0 min, 38% B; 2 min, 38% B; 12 min, 40% B; 17 min, 40% B; 18 min, 45% B; 22 min, 45% B; followed by column wash) was performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC Protein BEH C4, 300A, 1.7 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm column. The method was run at 0.2 mL/min, at a column temperature of 80 °C, and a sample temperature of 8° C. The nanoparticles were diluted to 0.12 mg/mL in PBS and 25 µL was injected (3 µg). Due to the denaturing property of the organic mobile phase, the nanoparticles are disassembled immediately after injection, and various HA molecules elute in separate peaks in the order of increasing hydrophobicity. The signal was monitored by UV at 280 nm. To calculate the molar ratio of various HA strains, the chromatographic peak areas at the detection wavelength of 280 nm were divided by the extinction coefficient of the corresponding HAs (Extinction coefficient of H1, H3, HBv and HBy are 1.68, 1.47, 1.22, and 1.26, respectively. The extinction coefficient of 1.24 is used for co-eluting B strains).MALDI-MS. A microFlex LT MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), run in positive mode with a pulsed nitrogen (emission 337 nm), 1000 ns delay, and 2 kV accelerating voltage, was used to measure the mass of the intact fluorescently labeled mAbs and Fabs. One µL of the purified sample (2 mg/mL) was mixed with 1 µL of 0.1% TFA and 1 µL of 10 mg/mL sinapinic acid solution (Ricca Chemical, MB15103241C) in 50% acetonitrile. One µL of the mixture was deposited onto the stainless steel MALDI target plate, air-dried, and measured by MALDI-MS. The data were collected with flexControl and processed with flexAnalysis (Bruker Daltonics).Cryo-EM. FluMos-v1 quadrivalent nanoparticles at a concentration of ~ 0.2 mg/mL were vitrified at room temperature and 95% humidity using Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI, Netherlands) by applying a 2.7-µl drop on a holey carbon grid (Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3) covered with a monolayer of graphene oxide and, after blotting, plunging the grid into liquid ethane. Data was collected using a Thermo Scientific Krios G1 electron microscope operated at 300 kV. 970 movies were recorded using a Falcon 3EC direct electron detector in the counting mode at a pixel size of 1.44 Å. The defocus range was 1–3 µm underfocus. Motion correction was performed with MotionCor240. Ctffind 4.1 was used to estimate the defocus of motion-corrected micrographs41. 2D classification and 3D reconstruction were performed with Relion 342. The resolution of the final map, determined from a dataset containing 16,416 particles with imposed icosahedral symmetry, was 4.9 Å.Negative Stain Electron Microscopy. Nanoparticle samples were diluted to about 0.05 mg/mL with buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, and 150 mM NaCl. Nanoparticles were adsorbed to a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper electron-microscopy grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences) by applying a 4.7-µl drop of the diluted sample for 15 s and removing the drop with filter paper. This was followed by three washes with the above buffer conducted in the same way. After the final wash, adsorbed material was negatively stained by applying consecutively three drops of 0.7% uranyl formate in the same manner and allowing the grid to air-dry. Datasets were collected on a Thermo Scientific Talos F200C transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with a Ceta camera. Particle picking was performed automatically using in-house written software (Y.T., unpublished). Relion 342 was used for reference-free 2D classification.Measuring Multivalency in Individual Nanoparticles via TIRF Microscopy. FluMos-v1 nanoparticles were generated as previously described. Nanoparticles were labeled with a Fab cocktail diluted in formulation buffer and consisting of the following fluorescently labeled Fabs: CF405S-F-H1, DyLight550-F-H3, DyLight488-F-HBv, and DyLight650-F-HBy). Following labeling and mixing with FluMos-v1, particles were centrifuged to removed unbound Fab and fluorophores, washed, and further diluted 1:500 in formulation buffer from originally concentration of about 0.07 mg/mL. 200 uL of particle suspension were plated in one well of an ibidi 8-well sticky-Slide (catalog #80828, Gräfelfing, Germany) affixed to an acid-washed #1.5 cover-glass (catalog #152455, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope equipped with an EMCCD iXon Ultra camera (Andor, Oxford, UK) using an SR HP ApoTIRF 1.49 NA, 100× objective. Twenty random fields of view were sequentially imaged with 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm laser lines. Resultant images were analyzed via Nikon Ar Elements software. Images were denoised using the advanced denoising algorithm, then channels were additively combined, and particle locations were determined via spot detection. Local maxima for each separate channel above a threshold determined by examination of singly labeled control nanoparticles were also established via spot detection. Particles were then labeled by valency by comparing particle locations with local channel maxima. Single color localizations with weak signal intensity were excluded from further analysis as dissociated HA trimers, as true monovalent nanoparticles should be highly labeled and exhibit comparatively greater intensities to multivalent particles.

Internet search data are recognized as a valuable source for forecasting influenza or other respiratory tract infection epidemics. However, the selection of internet search data and the application of forecasting methods are important for improving forecasting accuracy. The aim of the present study was to forecast influenza epidemics based on the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) method, Baidu search index data, and the influenza-like-illness (ILI) rate.MethodsThe official weekly ILI% data for northern and southern mainland China were obtained from the Chinese Influenza Center from 2018 to 2021. Based on the Baidu Index, search indices related to influenza infection over the corresponding time period were obtained. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to explore the association between influenza-related search queries and the ILI% of southern and northern mainland China. The LSTM model was used to forecast the influenza epidemic within the same week and at lags of 1–4 weeks. The model performance was assessed by evaluation metrics, including the mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).ResultsIn total, 24 search queries in northern mainland China and 7 search queries in southern mainland China were found to be correlated and were used to construct the LSTM model, which included the same week and a lag of 1–4 weeks. The LSTM model showed that ILI% + mask with one lag week and ILI% + influenza name were good prediction modules, with reduced RMSE predictions of 16.75% and 4.20%, respectively, compared with the estimated ILI% for northern and southern mainland China.ConclusionsThe results illuminate the feasibility of using an internet search index as a complementary data source for influenza forecasting and the efficiency of using the LSTM model to forecast influenza epidemics. Peer Review reports BackgroundSeasonal influenza and other respiratory tract infections remain serious public health problems. The WHO estimates that annual epidemics of influenza result in ~ 1 billion infections, 3 ~ 5 million severe cases of influenza and 300,000 ~ 650,000 deaths globally [1, 2]. A previous study estimated that 88,100 influenza-associated excess respiratory deaths occurred in China from 2010–2015 [3]. The National Health Commission of China reported that in 2020 and 2021, there were 1,145,278 and 668,246 influenza cases, with incidence rates of 81.5816 and 47.4008 per 100,000, respectively (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s3578/202103/f1a448b7df7d4760976fea6d55834966.shtml, http://www.nhc.gov.cn/jkj/s3578/202204/4fd88a291d914abf8f7a91f6333567e1.shtml.). These conditions pose significant social and economic burdens in China. Due to the occurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic trend of influenza decreased rapidly in 2020. However, the intensity of the influenza epidemic has gradually increased since the spring of 2021. Thus, it is essential to establish an influenza surveillance system to monitor influenza epidemic trends. In China, the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System (NNIDRS) and hospital-based influenza surveillance system from the Chinese Influenza Center (CNIC) are used for surveillance communicable disease and for the surveillance of influenza or other respiratory viruses, respectively. The National Health Commission of China monthly reported the infectious disease data after one month, causing the influenza data to lag for one month, while the hospital-based surveillance system lagged for one or two weeks. Thus, it is necessary to establish a real-time influenza forecasting system to rapidly forecast influenza or other respiratory disease trends.Currently, with the widespread use of the internet, people often seek help from the internet when they face health problems. When individuals search for information about health problems, including disease names, symptoms, therapies and prevention strategies, this information can be harnessed to monitor disease trends. In 2009, Ginsberg et al. first used Google query data to establish an influenza trend model to predict ILI rates in the U.S. in real time by monitoring millions of queries on their search engine; this approach overcomes the limitations of lag-time that are inherent to many traditional influenza surveillance systems [4]. Initially, the forecast system could provide accurate predictions and was expanded to other countries or regions. However, the forecast model was not stable because the influenza forecast trend exceeded the peak of the epidemic by more than 140% in 2013 in the U.S. and sparked a hot discussion about the limitation of search data in infectious disease research [5]. Since then, to predict disease epidemic trends, some research teams have attempted to assess the value of online search engines, including Google, Yahoo, Weibo, Baidu and Twitter, with different models and have obtained useful results. The field of digital epidemiology is still in an early stage, but it has begun to be used to forecast infectious disease epidemic trends, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic [6]. Thus, in the current article, we establish a forecasting model with Baidu search index data and ILI data to forecast trends in the incidence of seasonal influenza or other respiratory viruses in China.The long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is a model architecture for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that has been widely applied in text classification, time series classification and time series forecasting [7, 8]. Using multilayer and complex neural networks close to real values, a backwards propagation algorithm is used to continually shrink the fitting error [9]. For infectious diseases, long short-term memory (LSTM) models, such as those for influenza and dengue, which have better accuracy, have been widely used in the prediction of different diseases and obtain good prediction results [10,11,12,13,14]. Previous research has confirmed that in the field of time series data analysis and prediction with complex relationships, LSTM in deep learning models yields better results than traditional machine learning methods [10, 15, 16]. In this paper, we incorporated the ILI and online search indices of different keywords into the LSTM model to forecast trends in influenza or other respiratory viruses and validate whether online search index data can improve forecasting accuracy.Materials and methodsData collection and processingThe weekly ILIs for both northern and southern mainland China were obtained separately from the Influenza Weekly Report published by the Chinese Influenza Center (CNIC) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/cnic/) from January 2018 to December 2021. ILI patients were defined as outpatients of any age with acute respiratory infection syndrome with fever ≥ 38 °C and cough or sore throat. Influenza surveillance Sentinel hospitals distributed throughout all provinces of mainland China uploaded ILI case counts and total physician visit data to the Chinese Influenza surveillance system on Monday of the following week. The CNIC reports the aggregated data at the end of the next week, including the ILI%, which is the proportion of patients with ILI divided by the total number of physician visits. Due to the vast difference in the influenza epidemic situation among different regions, the CNIC releases the ILI% for northern and southern mainland China separately. The provinces in northern mainland China include Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Henan, Tibet, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang, and the provinces in southern mainland China include Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan.Online Baidu indexData on the Baidu search platform of 31 provinces were obtained from the Baidu Index (http://index.baidu.com) separately, an open online data service platform, on which we can obtain the daily search index for every keyword of every province. After filtering, we retrieved 30 keywords containing influenza-related symptom keywords or the keywords ‘flu’ or ‘influenza’ or the keywords of influenza prevention strategy for every province based on previous studies [4, 16, 17]. First, we collected the search indices of 30 selected influenza-related keywords from every province every day from 2018 to 2021 from the Baidu Index. Then, we obtained the weekly Baidu search index by adding the daily index. Finally, we computed the weekly index of the keywords northern and southern mainland China to obtain the total Baidu index of different keywords for northern and southern mainland China.Statistical analysisDescriptive analysisA descriptive analysis was used to reveal the characteristics of the current ILI% and the current search indices of different keywords on the Baidu search platform. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to explore the association between the influenza-related search indices and the ILI% in northern and southern mainland China. We also analysed the correlation between the previous week's search index (from week 1 to 4) and the current ILI. A correlation coefficient closer to 1 or –1 indicates a stronger correlation, and a correlation coefficient closer to 0 indicates a weaker correlation. We calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between each variable to observe the correlations between the variables. After performing the correlation analysis, we used the variables with correlation coefficients above 0.4 to develop forecasting models to improve the prediction accuracy based on previous studies [18, 19]. This study statistically analysed the usefulness of these potential predictors in forecasting ILI% and quantified their relationships during the influenza or respiratory illness seasons.Module formulationLTSM was used to predict the ILI% with the correlated search queries in China. LSTM is a special recurrent neural network (RNN) that is used to process sequence data. Compared with normal neural networks, RNNs perform well in processing sequential changes in data, but gradient disappearance and gradient explosion are inevitable. To solve this problem, an LSTM network is proposed for long sequence data, which has better performance than an RNN.To implement information protection and control, there are an input gate, forget gate and output gate and a memory cell in each memory block.The forget gate is controlled by a sigmoid to determine which information obtained from the previous moment can be retained at the current moment. The formula in the forget gate is F1. where \({W}_{f}\) is the weight matrix of the forget gate, \({x}_{t}\) is the current input, \({h}_{t-1}\) is the previous output of the memory block, \({b}_{f}\) is the bias term of the forget gate, and \(\sigma\) is the sigmoid function.$${f}_{t}=\sigma ({W}_{f}\cdot \left[{h}_{t-1},{x}_{t}\right]+{b}_{f})$$ (1) The input gate decides how much information from the input \({x}_{t}\) can be reserved. The formula for the input gate is F2. Here, \({W}_{i}\) is the weight matrix of the input gate, \({b}_{i}\) is the bias term of the input gate, and the other parameters are the same as those of F1.$${i}_{t}=\sigma ({W}_{i}\cdot \left[{h}_{t-1},{x}_{t}\right]+{b}_{i})$$ (2) The output gate determines the degree of dependence of the input \({x}_{t}\) and the current memory cell. The formula for the input gate is F3. Here, \({W}_{o}\) is the weight matrix of the output gate, \({b}_{o}\) is the bias term of the output gate, and the other parameters are the same as those in F1.$${o}_{t}=\sigma ({W}_{o}\cdot \left[{h}_{t-1},{x}_{t}\right]+{b}_{o})$$ (3) In each t, there is a memory cell, and the cell state is important for LSTM, which allows the LSTM to select memory. The formulas for determining the cell state are F4, F5 and F6. where \({W}_{c}\) is the weight matrix of the current cell state, \({b}_{c}\) is the bias term of the current cell state, and \(tanh\) is an active function.$$\widetilde{{C}_{t}}=tanh({W}_{c}\cdot \left[{h}_{t-1},{x}_{t}\right]+{b}_{c})$$ (4) $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{t-1}+{i}_{t}*\widetilde{{C}_{t}}$$ (5) $${h}_{t}={o}_{t}*{{\text{tanh}}(C}_{t})$$ (6) In this study, the absolute values of the Baidu index data and the ILI% were not on the same order of magnitude; we normalized all the data to be between 0 and 1 for further analysis and training. We defined the LSTM model with three layers, and there were 512 neurons in each layer. To reduce overfitting, we set a bias regularizer with regularization L2 (0.005). To train the model, we fit the model for 150 training epochs with a batch size of 64, and the learning rate was 0.0001. In the process, 126 sets of data (from week 201801 to week 202022) were used as the training set, 42 sets of data (from week 202023 to week 202111) were used as the validation set, and 41 sets of data (from week 202212 to week 202152) were used as the test set for model prediction. The obtained data were compared with the actual data to observe the model’s fitting effect. Moreover, to reduce overfitting, the dataset was augmented by averaging the data values of the two adjacent columns in turn and inserting the obtained average value between the two columns. Thus, the original dataset was expanded to eight times through three-time amplification. For northern and southern mainland China, both the ILI% and Baidu search indices were input into the LSTM module to train, validate and forecast, respectively. Four metrics were used to measure the performance of the LSTM model, namely, the R2, mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), which measure the accuracy of a forecasting method in statistics. An R2 close to 1 and MAE and MSE close to 0 indicate the good prediction effect of the model. The RMSE is sensitive to extreme errors or very small errors in a set of measurements and can reflect the accuracy of the prediction.ResultsILI% trend in ChinaThe ILI was reported every week of each year, and the ILI% presented a regular seasonal high incidence in northern and southern mainland China from 2018 to 2021. The average weekly ILI% was 2.79% and 3.62% in northern and southern mainland China, respectively. For northern mainland China, the highest ILI% was in the 1st week in 2018 (5.8%), the 6th week in 2019 (6.2%), the 5th week in 2020 (8.5%) and the 52nd week in 2021 (4.1%). For southern mainland China, the highest ILI% was observed in the 3rd week in 2018 (6.7%), the 6th week in 2019 (6.8%), the 5th week in 2020 (8.0%) and the 23rd week in 2021 (4.4%). During the period from January 2018 to March 2020, the highest ILI% was observed in the winter season in mainland China, and the duration of high ILI% was longer in the southern region than in the northern region; however, during the period from April 2020 to March 2021, the ILI% was lower than the average ILI%. Beginning in April 2021, the ILI% returned to its original level gradually, and two small peaks occurred in June and December 2021. (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Different ILI% of Northern and Southern Mainland China. Note:1801 represents the first week in 2018Full size imageBaidu search queriesWe retrieved information on 30 search terms, including different influenza names, influenza symptoms, influenza drugs and mask sales. For all 30 terms, the weekly Baidu search index of northern and southern mainland China was calculated based on the diary search index of every province. The weekly average numbers of different keywords in the Baidu search indices for northern and southern mainland China are compared in Table 1. Pearson correlation analysis was also conducted between the Baidu search index and the ILI% across different lag periods, including the current week and a lag of one week, at lags of two, three and four weeks. The correlation coefficients of ILI% and different Baidu search queries varied widely in northern and southern mainland China. For northern mainland China, 24 terms of the Baidu search query statistics were correlated with the ILI% and with the lag weeks, with a correlation coefficient above 0.4, while only 7 terms were correlated in southern mainland China. The detailed information is provided in Table 1. Table 1 Pearson association between Baidu search terms and ILI% in Northern and Southern mainland China from 2018–2021Full size tableEvaluation schemeFirst, the original ILI% was solely input into the LSTM module as the gold standard for predicting the ILI% activity trend. Second,, the ILI% was simultaneously input into the LSTM module with a Baidu search index with a correlation coefficient above 0.4; these factors were divided into five categories with different lag times – namely, ILI% + all of the Baidu index, ILI% + the index of influenza name, ILI% + the index of influenza therapy and drug, ILI% + the index of influenza symptoms and ILI% + the index of mask – to compare the effects of the different combinations with the calculated MSE, RMSE, MAE and R2. For northern mainland China, the R2 of ILI% + the index of masks with one lag week module reached 0.9055, which was greater than the corresponding values of the ILI% alone, and other combinations of ILI% + the Baidu search index. Similarly, the MAE was 0.14325, and the MSE was 0.02762, which were lower than the corresponding values of the ILI% alone, the other combinations of ILI% + the Baidu search index (Table 2). For southern mainland China, the R2 of ILI% + the index of the influenza name module reached 0.75579, which was higher than the corresponding values of the ILI% alone, other combinations of ILI% + the Baidu search index. Similarly, the MAE was 0.17832, and the MSE was 0.05211, which were lower than the corresponding values of the ILI% alone, and other combinations of ILI% + the Baidu search index(Table 2). These results showed that ILI% + the index of masks with one lag week and ILI + the index of influenza name had the best prediction effects for northern and southern mainland China, respectively. The LSTM module reduced the RMSE predictions by 16.75% and 4.20% compared with the estimated ILI% for northern and southern mainland China, respectively. We then constructed a prediction diagram, and the results showed that the actual values were consistent with each other and that the accuracy was high (Figs. 2 and 3).

Note: 202112 represents the twelfth week in 2021Full size imageDiscussion and conclusionThe dynamic assessment and forecasting of epidemic trends are important parts of the prevention and control of infectious diseases. The ILI% is a good indicator for detecting respiratory illness and influenza viruses. To predict respiratory illness trends, the ILI% was used to predict trends in influenza virus or respiratory illness incidence. To predict the trend precisely, several researchers have used the ILI% and search indices to predict respiratory illness incidence via different methods, such as the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and linear regression models [20,21,22,23]. However, the results have shown that the prediction accuracy is not high [16, 24]. With the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms have shown advantages in prediction and recognition. LSTM is an advanced RNN with the ability to learn time patterns and store useful memories longer. This type of LSTM has been widely used to analyse and predict time series data in various sectors and was confirmed to outperform some statistical-based algorithms. [10, 25]. At present, there are few reports on the prediction of influenza infection with an RNN combined with the Baidu Index [16]. In this study, we reviewed the Baidu search index related to ILI% and proposed an LSTM model to predict the occurrence of respiratory disease or influenza virus in northern and southern mainland China; the results confirmed that the Baidu search intensity of keywords is a useful disease surveillance tool and further showed that the ILI% + Baidu search index performed significantly well as a predictor compared with the ILI% alone.Previous research on disease predictions has shown that data from social media, including Google, Twitter and other media containing important information, can be used to effectively predict disease incidence, and there is a strong correlation between disease searchers and disease cases [26,27,28,29,30]. Moreover, the search behaviour of the user could show the degree of concern of the user to a certain event or something. Information search behaviour is a targeted information acquisition behaviour carried out by users to meet their specific needs [31]. When people around them suffer from influenza or have influenza-like symptoms, many people tend to search for influenza prevention measures, flu symptoms and other related information from the internet. In this study, our results revealed that 7 Baidu search queries strongly correlated with ILI%, not only in northern mainland China but also in southern mainland China; these queries included H1N1 pdm2009, influenza, Tamiflu, oseltamivir, oseltamivir granules, symptoms of influenza A, and symptoms of influenza. However, in northern mainland China, the other 17 items still had a strong correlation with the ILI%. To pursue this reason, some possible intrinsic limitations in the application of search data for epidemic disease surveillance should be considered. For instance, web users’ educational level, regional background, cognition level and disease epidemic trends can influence users’ search habits and keywords. For influenza, there is only one epidemic peak annually in northern mainland China, while there are two epidemic peaks in southern mainland China. Differences in influenza epidemic trends may influence cognition levels and thus influence behavioural habits. In northern mainland China, most people suffer from influenza or respiratory illness in winter; thus, the search index increases rapidly in winter, including some symptoms and use of masks. However, in southern mainland China, most people suffer from influenza or respiratory illness twice a year [32]; thus, they learn about epidemic trends; thus, they do not focus on symptoms or prevention measures. Therefore, we cannot integrate all the search indices into the model to forecast disease epidemic trends because not all Baidu indices are strongly correlated with the ILI%. According to the LSTM model, the ILI% + mask at lag 1 week was a good predictor of the ILI% trend in northern mainland China; however, for southern China, the ILI% + influenza name was the best predictor, which has not been discussed in other studies. Therefore, for disease prediction, high correlation data and classification data can improve the accuracy, and some classification data further strengthen the prediction accuracy. Our study revealed that geographical location may affect the prediction of disease epidemics.The algorithms and computational techniques used for computation and analysis still need to be carefully refined, tuned and calibrated to avoid overfitting risk in big data. To avoid overfitting issues in the LSTM model, in our study, after three amplifications, the data (including one ILI sequence and twenty-four or seven Baidu Index sequences) were found to be sufficient to improve the robustness of our training effect at the data level. Second, the LSTM model is a lightweight and appropriate model for solving our target problem. This model provides several methods for reducing overfitting, including increasing the number of LSTM layers, increasing the number of LSTM units, eliminating dropouts, using regularization, and using additional training data. In our paper, to reduce overfitting, we modified the LSTM model by adding three layers and 512 units in each layer and used biasregularizer to train the model.The prediction of epidemic trends due to influenza or respiratory illness is a topic of intense discussion worldwide. Adding the Baidu search index of influenza-related keywords to influenza forecasting can effectively improve the accuracy of influenza forecasting in China. Furthermore, the influence of the search indices of different keywords on the accuracy of the prediction results varies. The next step of this research will involve incorporating relevant meteorological factors into the model, hoping to construct more accurate prediction models of influenza and respiratory diseases through multidimensional factors.

The researchers, a group called the Canadian Immunization Research Network (CIRN) Provincial Collaborative Network (PCN) Investigators, analyzed data from lab and health administration databases in the province from the 2010-11 through the 2018-19 flu seasons. Participants were Ontarians 6 months and older living in the community who received a flu vaccine before being tested for influenza using polymerase chain reaction tests. Of 53,065 people who were vaccinated before testing, 10,264 (19%) tested positive for flu. The investigators determined that the odds of contracting influenza increased from 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.22) at 42 to 69 days after vaccination, and peaked at 1.27 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.55) at 126 to 153 days compared with the reference interval, which was 14 to 41 days after vaccination. This corresponds to a 5% to 27% drop in VE compared with shortly after vaccination. No waning protection found in kids The researchers also determined that VE dropped 9% every 28 days—or a 1.09-times increased risk of influenza every 28 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.15). They did not, however, observe any VE waning in children. Adults 18 to 64 years showed the greatest decline in protection against the H1N1 strain (aOR per 28 days, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.64). For people 65 years and older, it was against the H3N2 strain (aOR per 28 days, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.33). Annual influenza vaccination programmes need to strike the balance between vaccinating the population too early versus too late. The authors conclude, "Annual influenza vaccination programmes need to strike the balance between vaccinating the population too early versus too late, while taking into account system vaccination capacity and year-to-year variability of influenza season timing." They add, "Certain age groups may experience more pronounced waning of the protection against specific influenza types/subtypes." Indiana reports first measles case in 5 years News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Measles The Indiana Department of Health (IDH) today announced that a measles infection has been confirmed in a Lake County resident, marking the state’s first case in 5 years. Dave Haygarth / Flickr cc In a statement, it said it wouldn't add any other details about the case to protect patient privacy, and that the risk to the public is low. State and local officials continue to investigate the case. Lake County is in northwestern Indiana and is considered part of the Chicago metropolitan area.State health commissioner Lindsay Weaver, MD, said 90% of unvaccinated people who are exposed to measles will become sick. "This case is a good reminder that you are at risk if you haven’t been vaccinated," she said.This case is a good reminder that you are at risk if you haven’t been vaccinated.The IDH also shared details about three measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine clinics next week, offering free vaccine for people older than 1 year old who would like to be vaccinated.Minnesota reports third measles caseElsewhere, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) added one more measles case to its total for 2024, bringing the total to three.The state's two earlier cases are siblings who live in the Twin Cities metro area, CBS Minnesota reported, citing state health officials. One of the Minnesota cases is recorded as imported, and the other two cases are related. Officials have said that the risk to the public is extremely low.US total rises to 35 cases in 14 states and NYCIn related developments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today updated its measles total for 2024 today, adding 15 more cases since February 15 and bringing the total to 35.In late January, the CDC urged providers to be alert for measles cases given a steady rise in global cases against the backdrop of gaps in vaccine coverage. WHO advisers recommend strain picks for next Northern Hemisphere flu vaccines News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Influenza Vaccines The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced the flu vaccine strain recommendations from its advisory group for the Northern Hemisphere 2024-25 flu season, which are the same as the group recommended for the Southern Hemisphere's 2024 season. CDC/ Dr. F. A. Murphy As for its recommendation for the Southern Hemisphere seasonal flu vaccines in September, the WHO experts recommends that companies switch back to trivalent (three-strain) vaccines and leave out the influenza B Yamagata lineage component. Yamagata B lineage not detected since 2020 In accompanying background information, the WHO said no naturally occurring influenza B Yamagata lineage viruses have been confirmed since March 2020 and that the vaccine strain isn't needed anymore. The recommendations for egg-based and cell-based vaccine strains vary, and the latest picks for both versions of the Northern Hemisphere vaccines are the same those recommended for the Southern Hemisphere. For countries that still use quadrivalent (four-strain) versions of the vaccine containing a second B strain, the WHO recommends a strain similar to the Yamagata Phuket/3073/2013 lineage virus, the same as other recent picks. Advisers pick 2 new pandemic preparedness vaccine viruses During their twice-a-year meetings to recommend strains to include in seasonal flu vaccines, the WHO's advisory group also examines the latest developments with zoonotic flu strains to see if any new viruses are different enough from earlier strains to warrant new candidate vaccine strains for pandemic preparedness. At its meeting, the group proposed two new candidate strains, both targeting recent variant H1N1 viruses. One is antigenically similar to A/Catalonia/NSAV198289092/2023, and the other is similar to A/England/234600203/2023. Chronic wasting disease confirmed in another Arkansas county News brief Jim Wappes Topics Chronic Wasting Disease Colby Stopa / Flickr cc The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC) yesterday confirmed that a hunter-harvested white-tailed deer in Craighead County tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), an always-fatal prion disease. The 2-year-old doe was harvested near Jonesboro during the Arkansas firearm season late last year. A sample from the doe tested positive for CWD, and the finding was confirmed by the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Madison. Craighead County is in northeastern Arkansas, abutting Missouri and not far from the Tennessee border. Expanded CWD management zone The AGFC noted that, in addition to Craighead County, three new counties—Sharp, Cleburne, and Mississippi—have been added to the CWD management zone owing to their proximity to other newly identified CWD positive cases. "This proactive measure of including counties based on risk values is outlined in the state's CWD Management and Response Plan," the AGFC said. Cory Gray, chief of the AGFC's Research Division, said, "Protecting the health of Arkansas's deer herd is our top priority. We are being very proactive in all of our CWD management areas." Protecting the health of Arkansas's deer herd is our top priority. CWD is a neurologic disease that leads to animals' deteriorating physical condition, including wasting, in deer, elk, caribou and moose. Officials first detected it in Arkansas in February 2016. Since then, the AGFC has tested more than 40,670 deer and elk for CWD, and 1,260 deer and 38 elk—or about 3% of all animals tested—have tested positive for the disease. Birth-month study shows importance of timing for flu shot News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Influenza Vaccines Influenza, General Sasiistock / iStock Children born in October and vaccinated against influenza in that month are both more likely to be vaccinated against flu and less likely to be diagnosed as having influenza than children born in other months, according to a new study The BMJ. The observational study is based on insurance records of 800,000 US children ages 2 to 5 years old who received flu vaccines from 2011 to 2018. Researchers analyzed rates of diagnosed influenza among children by birth month, and found that those with October birthdays had the lowest rates. US children typically visit pediatricians around their birthday each year for well-check visits and routine vaccinations, and children who visit in October were likely offered the seasonal flu shot as it was available. The seasonal shot would not likely be ready for children with spring and summer birthdays, the authors said. October flu vaccinations were greater in children with October births compared with other birth months, with 48.9% of children born in October were vaccinated in October, compared with 34.0% of children born in August, 40.2% of those born in September, 27.3% of those born in November, and 33.7% of those born in December. October may be best month to get flu shot The authors found that 2.7% of children born and vaccinated in October were diagnosed as having flu that season. The percentage rose to 3.0% of those born and vaccinated in August or January, 2.9% of those born and vaccinated in September or December, and 2.8% of those born and vaccinated in November. This suggests October maybe the optimal time to be vaccinated against the flu. "Under the assumption that children born in October are otherwise similar to children born in other months, our findings suggest that the specific timing of influenza vaccination among children born in October may lead to lower rates of influenza infection," the authors concluded. In a Harvard Medical School press release on the findings, senior study author Anupam Jena, MD, PhD, said, "There are a lot of variables when it comes to the timing and severity of flu season or a person’s risk of getting sick, and many of those are out of our control. One thing we have some control over is the timing of the shot, and it looks like October is indeed the best month for kids to get vaccinated against the flu."

Department of Health Says Public Health Risk Low Following First Case of Avian Influenza in Backyard Flock W.Va. Department of Health Says Public Health Risk Low Following First Case of Avian Influenza in Backyard Flock 2/21/2024 Page Content​The West Virginia Department of Health (WVDH) is offering guidance following con​​​firmation​ of the first case of the Highly Pathogenic avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in a non-commercial backyard flock in Kanawha County. It is the first confirmed case in backyard flocks or commercial birds since 2006. ​WVDH and the West Virginia Department of Agriculture (WVDA) are working closely with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to monitor the exposed individuals to prevent transmission of the virus. At this time, the public health risk is limited to those who had direct contact with the birds; avian influenza does not spread easily to humans. The virus spreads easily among poultry through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers.“This virus has been previously identified in surrounding states, it is important to note that the risk of transmission to humans is very low and limited to those with direct contact with the birds,” said West Virginia State Health Officer Dr. Matthew Christiansen, M.D., M.P.H. “If you have concerns about your exposure or symptoms, you should isolate at home and contact your primary care doctor and local health department.”Dr. Christiansen reminds residents that the confirmed case does not present an immediate public health concern. “We will continue to follow this closely and provide updates if the risk changes.” The WVDA also points out that avian influenza does not affect poultry, meat, or egg products, which remain safe to eat. As a reminder, proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs is recommended as a general food safety precaution. USDA will continue to conduct additional surveillance during the quarantine to protect the poultry industry in the state. “The WVDA will continue to work with USDA-APHIS on monitoring and follow all protocols to protect our valuable poultry industry,” said Commissioner of Agriculture Kent Leonhardt.

Study: Optimal timing of influenza vaccination in young children: population based cohort study. Image Credit: Yuganov Konstantin/Shutterstock.com Background The yearly influenza vaccination is critical for lowering morbidity and death from seasonal influenza, although large-scale research on optimal scheduling is lacking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises vaccines in October or September to optimize vaccine-induced protection. Delays in vaccination might lead to influenza virus exposure without immunity. Experts advise balancing vaccine-elicited protection throughout the season while avoiding missed chances. Young children are at high risk, but there is little clinical data to recommend vaccine scheduling. About the study In the current retrospective observational population-based cohort study, researchers examined influenza vaccination and illness patterns among infants born in periods of influenza vaccine availability. The study included commercially insured children aged two to five years who were vaccinated against influenza between 2011 and 2018 and remained registered in insurance for one or more influenza seasons between September and May months of the following year. The primary outcome indicators were the rates of influenza diagnosis among pediatric vaccinees, broken down by birth month. The researchers limited the study to children born between 1 August and 31 January, as preventative visits might alter the influenza vaccination timing in the children. The cohort only included children who had received influenza vaccines from August to January months of the following year, as evidenced by insurance claims with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for vaccinations against influenza viruses.

The model variables included the child's age, gender, healthcare utilization, family size, and comorbidities, including past pulmonary illness. The researchers calculated the influenza risk using the actual vaccination month and variables at the pediatric influenza season level. They also investigated whether children had yearly checkups around birthdays and compared influenza vaccination rates on preventive health visits to those on surrounding days. The team assessed the vaccination timing by birth month, determining if infants born earlier got vaccinations sooner on average. They performed multiple analyses to evaluate the association between birth month and influenza risk, examining the influence on superficial injury visits, non-influenza infectious illnesses, conjunctivitis, viral gastroenteritis, and common infectious disorders. They repeated the original study after giving infants random birth months to see if the results were attributable to chance alone. Results The study examined vaccination rates among 819,223 children aged two to five years in the United States. The results showed that children who had November-December vaccinations were less likely to receive an influenza diagnosis, potentially due to unmeasured variables impacting vaccine timing and influenza risk. Vaccinations are often administered on the days of preventative healthcare visits and throughout the birth months. October-born children showed disproportionate vaccinations, with an average vaccination timing later than August-born ones but earlier than December-born ones. October showed the lowest percentage of influenza diagnoses, with 2.7% of children vaccinated compared to 3.0% in August. The general schedule of influenza vaccines remained consistent year after year; however, the peak of influenza diagnoses fluctuated. Most children (37% of all child seasons) received vaccinations in October. January- or December-born children were less likely to receive vaccinations at their preventative visit since many may been immunized earlier in the autumn. The researchers found no significant variations in children's demographic and clinical parameters between birth months, including their estimated influenza infection risk. However, the influenza vaccination varied by month of birth. Vaccination took place on average sooner for children born in earlier months. October-born children received more vaccinations than children born in other months. Unadjusted influenza diagnostic rates varied by birth month, with the lowest rates occurring in children born in October. In an adjusted study, children born in October were less likely to be diagnosed with influenza than in other birth months. Falsification studies using random birth months and superficial damage, viral gastroenteritis, or conjunctivitis showed no relevant relationships between birth months. However, in subgroup evaluations focusing on pediatric individuals with prior pulmonary disease history or those in the upper third quartile of Elixhauser comorbid conditions and MSA areas with high influenza severity, the team observed a higher absolute reduction in influenza infection among October-born children than in other birth months. Conclusion Overall, the study findings showed that the birth month is associated with the influenza vaccination timing in young children, particularly those with birthdays in October. October-born children are more likely to receive vaccines and have fewer influenza diagnoses, supporting the guideline for October vaccination. Utilizing the month of birth for natural experimentation may determine the ideal influenza vaccination timing, as immunity to influenza decreases during the flu season. US public health measures centered on vaccination in October may provide the most protection during average flu seasons. Journal reference: Christopher M. Worsham, Charles F. Bray, and Anupam B.

Here, we prepared individual WPVs composed of formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 WK 521 (Ancestral strain; Co WPV) or influenza virus [A/California/07/2009 (X-179A) (H1N1) pdm; Flu WPV] to produce a two-in-one Co/Flu WPV. Serum analysis from vaccinated mice revealed that a single dose of Co/Flu WPV induced antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies against both viruses, similar to those induced by either type of WPV alone. Following infection with either virus, mice vaccinated with Co/Flu WPV showed no weight loss, reduced pneumonia and viral titers in the lung, and lower gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines, as observed with individual WPV-vaccinated. Furthermore, a pentavalent vaccine (Co/qFlu WPV) comprising of Co WPV and quadrivalent influenza vaccine (qFlu WPV) was immunogenic and protected animals from severe COVID-19. These results suggest that a single dose of the two-in-one WPV provides efficient protection against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections with no evidence of vaccine interference in mice. We propose that concomitant vaccination with the two-in-one WPV can be useful for controlling both diseases.

After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, morbidities and mortalities resulting from seasonal influenza viruses declined steeply1,2,3 owing to non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 control, such as global travel restrictions, pro-social behavioral changes and good hygiene practices4,5,6. However, with countries lifting strict control measures and increasing international travel, case numbers and fatalities of seasonal influenza have gradually increased7,8. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, both diseases pose a serious public health threat, especially the risk of co-infection, which is associated with exacerbation of clinical outcomes9,10,11.To date, vaccination is the most effective and economical method for controlling COVID-19 and seasonal influenza. Mass vaccination efforts against both COVID-19 and influenza could overwhelm healthcare systems, particularly in developing countries, and cause vaccination fatigue and further delays would increase the risk of infection with either virus. For instance, vaccination rates against seasonal influenza were significantly lower in post-COVID-19 years12,13 and therefore vulnerable populations may be at risk of severe influenza disease unless they have had an immune boosting caused by natural infection with the seasonal influenza viruses. Thus, there is a need for efficient vaccination strategies. Accordingly, the World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends the concomitant administration of licensed COVID-19 and seasonal influenza vaccines14.Concomitant or combined vaccination can be in different forms, including co-formulation and co-administration15. In the context of vaccines, the former implies a single vaccine containing antigens from different microbes administered as a single dose, while the latter refers to the inoculation of different vaccine formulations at the same time, usually on different body parts15,16. Currently, there is limited evidence regarding the safety and protectivity of co-formulated COVID-19 and seasonal influenza vaccines. The risk of reduced immunogenicity of one or more antigens in the vaccine and the possible exacerbation of side effects needs to be addressed. Recent evidence has shown successful protection against COVID-19 and influenza by a co-formulated mRNA vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus in mice17. However, difficulty in handling mRNA vaccines, particularly requirement and maintenance of cold chain transportation, in addition to potential adverse effects18,19,20, makes their use undesirable for annual vaccination.Classical inactivated whole virus particle vaccines (WPVs) have been used for preventing seasonal influenza21 and other infectious diseases22,23,24,25. In the production of inactivated vaccines, inactivation is a crucial step to ensure the vaccine is safe for use. Commonly used inactivation methods include the use of formaldehyde, beta-propiolactone, solvents/detergents such as ether and triton X-100 and non-traditional methods including gamma and ultraviolet radiation are employed for virus inactivation26,27. Because irradiation methods have not been validated for the production of inactivated vaccines for human use, formaldehyde and B-propiolactone remain widely used for inactivated vaccine preparation. Although they cause structural modification, precise optimization of experimental conditions such as duration of inactivation, temperature, buffer, and concentration of inactivating agent could achieve a more functional product28.As with influenza, inactivated WPV for COVID-19 have been developed and licensed for use in humans, with relatively mild adverse effects compared to mRNA or vectored vaccines29. Improved production technologies have alleviated WPV-associated side effects historically linked to contaminants during vaccine preparation. Their potent immunogenicity, ease of handling, stability, long shelf life, and good safety profile render WPVs ideal for annual COVID-19 and influenza vaccination. Furthermore, a study by Bao et al.10 showed successful protection from COVID-19 and seasonal influenza in an animal model after vaccination with a co-formulated vaccine containing adjuvanted COVID-19 WPV and influenza split virus vaccine (SV). Another group reported the safety and immunogenicity of the same adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine co-administered with a seasonal quadrivalent influenza SV in adults10,30. However, the use of influenza SV in the Bao et al. study may pose a challenge since SV has modest immunogenicity in high-risk groups thus an alternative such as WPV would be appropriate. A two-in-one vaccine utilizing WPV instead of SV may hold a more comprehensive immunization strategy because of the ability to induce broad and balanced immune response, robust induction of antibodies and T cells to a wide array of viral antigens, generation of immunological memory, and good priming potency in naïve individuals31,32.Here, the development of a two-in-one COVID-19/influenza WPV containing antigens of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza virus strains derived from cell culture and embryonated chicken eggs, respectively, is reported for induction of humoral immunity and protection against SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza viruses. It is shown that a single inoculation with the unadjuvanted WPV elicits an antigen-specific immune response and protects BALB/c mice from SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus infection.ResultsCo-formulation does not interfere with inducing vaccine-specific antibody responsesWe prepared individual WPVs composed of formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 WK-521, (Ancestral strain; Co WPV) or influenza virus A/California/07/2009 (X-179A) (H1N1) pdm, [A/California (H1N1); Flu WPV]. Co WPV and Flu WPV were mixed to produce, a two-in-one vaccine (Co/Flu WPV) containing equal amounts of protein from each vaccine. To assess the induction of virus-specific humoral immunity, we measured neutralizing antibody titers against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 using serum obtained from BALB/c mice 19 days after vaccination with a single dose of Co WPV, Flu WPV, Co/Flu WPV, or PBS as the control (Fig. 1a). Mice that received Flu WPV or Co/Flu WPV mounted higher levels of HA inhibiting (HI) and neutralizing antibodies titers against A/California (H1N1) compared to mice inoculated with PBS (Fig. 1b,c). Neutralizing antibody titers against the influenza virus ranged from 160 to 640 in mice vaccinated with Flu WPV or Co/Flu WPV with no statistically significant differences between the groups. As expected, we did not detect HI or neutralizing antibody titers against influenza virus in animals inoculated with either PBS or Co WPV. Neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 were also comparable between animals receiving Co WPV only (range 80–320) and those vaccinated with Co/Flu WPV (range 80–160), which were both higher than PBS control (Fig. 1d). These results reveal that co-formulation of Flu WPV and Co WPV has no apparent interfering effect on antibody production against respective antigens.Figure 1Antibodies against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. Female BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with Co WPV, Flu WPV, Co/Flu WPV, or PBS as the control group, and sample collection and virus challenge experiments were conducted (n = 5/group; (a). Sera were collected at 19 days post-vaccination for measurement of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers (b) and neutralizing antibodies against A/California/07/2009 (X-179A)(H1N1) [A/California (H1N1)] (c) and SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 (Ancestral strain) (d). Mean and SD are shown. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests. **p < 0.01.Full size imageProtection from influenza virus challengeTo investigate whether co-formulated Co/Flu WPV confers protection from influenza virus challenge in vivo, BALB/c mice vaccinated with Co WPV, Flu WPV, Co/Flu WPV, or PBS were intranasally challenged with 3000 plaque forming units [3000 PFU ~ 40 × 50% mouse lethal dose 50 (40 MLD50)] of influenza A/California (H1N1) virus on day 22 (Fig. 1a). Body weight of mice in the PBS group and those vaccinated with Co WPV steadily decreased from day 3 onwards by up to 20% of initial body weight before the challenge, while body weight of those vaccinated with Flu WPV and Co/Flu WPV fluctuated within normal ranges (Fig. 2a). To evaluate efficacy of Co/Flu WPV in suppressing virus replication, we measured virus titers in the right lobes of the lungs at 3- and 5-days post-infection (dpi). Virus titers in lung homogenates of the PBS group and Co WPV group were approximately 105 and 104 PFU/mL at 3 and 5 dpi, respectively (Fig. 2b,c). By contrast, virus titers were under the detection limit in lung homogenates from mice vaccinated with Flu WPV or Co/Flu WPV (Fig. 2b,c). These observations were consistent with the results of immunohistochemistry staining for the influenza virus, where viral antigens were not detected in the lungs of mice inoculated with either Flu WPV or Co/Flu WPV at 5 dpi, suggesting efficient protection by the vaccine (Fig. 2d).Figure 2Protection from influenza virus challenge. Female BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with Co WPV, Flu WPV, Co/Flu WPV, or PBS as the control group, and sample collection and virus challenge experiments were conducted as shown in Fig. 1a (n = 10/group). At 22 days post-vaccination, the animals were challenged with 3,000 PFU of A/California (H1N1). Following the influenza virus challenge, body weight change (a) and lung viral loads were measured at 3 and 5 dpi (b and c). Mean and SD are shown. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests. **p < 0.01. Some lung tissues harvested at 5 dpi were used to analyze lung pathology by H&E and immunohistochemistry to detect influenza A virus and macrophage (F4/80) and neutrophil (Ly-6G) markers (d). Each lung section is a representative of 5 lung sections analysed. Gene expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured using real-time RT-PCR (e).

Five days after influenza virus challenge, mice in the PBS and Co WPV groups showed diffuse pneumonia with increased alveolar wall thickness, infiltration of inflammatory cells, denudation of bronchial epithelium, and deposition of necrotic debris in the bronchial lumen. In addition, perivascular and peribronchiolar cuffing was observed. Infiltrating inflammatory cells mainly consisted of macrophages and neutrophils as shown by immunostaining using anti-F4/80 and anti-Ly-6G antibodies. Conversely, mice that received Flu WPV or Co/Flu WPV showed very mild pathology which differed only slightly from lung sections of non-infected control group, suggesting that these animals were protected from influenza virus-induced pneumonia (Fig. 2d and Supplemental figs. S1 and S2a).To further investigate protection from pulmonary pathology, we measured gene expression of colony stimulating factor 2 (Csf2), Csf3, interleukin- 1 beta (Il1b), Il6, Il10, interferon-gamma (Ifng), tumor necrosis factor (Tnf), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (Cxcl10), C–C motif chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2), and intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (Icam1) in lung tissue collected at 3 and 5 dpi (Fig. 2e). After influenza virus challenge, the expression of majority of inflammatory genes was elevated in PBS- and Co WPV-vaccinated groups, but much lower in animals vaccinated with Flu WPV or Co/Flu WPV at both sampling time points, consistent with the histology data. There was no major difference between gene expression levels in mice vaccinated with Flu WPV, Co/Flu WPV or the non-infected control group, although Csf, Cxcl10 and Il10 levels in Flu WPV and Co/Flu WPV mice were slightly higher than non-infected control mice. Together, our results suggest that the co-formulated Co/Flu WPV can protect mice from influenza virus challenge.Protection from SARS-CoV-2 infectionWe then investigated the protectivity of Co/Flu WPV against SARS-CoV-2 infection as we did with the influenza challenge model above. Vaccinated BALB/c mice were challenged with 105 PFU of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 Ancestral strain (SARS-CoV-2 MA-P1033), 22 days after vaccination. At 4 dpi, animals vaccinated with Flu WPV or PBS lost up to 15% of their initial body weight while those vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/Flu WPV did not lose body weight throughout the period of observation (Fig. 3a). While infectious virus was detected in the lungs of all animals at 3 dpi, animals vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/Flu WPV had approximately 100-fold lower virus titers than those in the PBS and Flu WPV groups (Fig. 3b). Moreover, some mice vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/Flu WPV did not have detectable virus at 3 dpi indicating protection by vaccine-induced immunity, and by 5 dpi, these two groups had no culturable virus detected in the lung homogenates (Fig. 3b,c). Consistently, immunostaining analyses revealed lower signals of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid in the lungs of animals vaccinated with Flu WPV or PBS, but not in those vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/Flu WPV (Fig. 3d). However, histopathological analyses with H&E showed clear pneumonia as indicated by increased infiltration of leukocytes in the peri-bronchiolar and alveolar areas, thickening of alveolar septa, perivascular cuffing, and deposition of necrotic debris in the bronchial lumen in the lungs of all immunized and non-immunized mice at 5 dpi (Fig. 3d and Supplemental Fig. S2b). Infiltrating inflammatory cells were mainly characterized by macrophages and neutrophils as seen in immunostained lung sections using anti-F4/80 and anti-Ly-6G antibodies.Figure 3Protection from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Female BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with Co WPV, Flu WPV, Co/Flu WPV, or PBS as the control group, and sample collection and virus challenge experiments were conducted as shown in Fig. 1a (n = 10/group). At 22 days post-vaccination, the animals were challenged with 105 PFU of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 MA-P10). Following virus challenge, body weight change was monitored (a) and lung viral loads were measured at 3 and 5 dpi (b and c). Mean and SD are shown. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests. **p < 0.01. Some lung tissues harvested at 5 dpi were used to analyze lung pathology by H&E and immunohistochemistry to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and macrophage (F4/80) and neutrophil (Ly-6G) markers (d).

Many of the cytokines and chemokines that have been implicated in severe COVID-19 infection, including Il6, Tnf, and Ilb34 were increased in the PBS- and Flu WPV-inoculated groups but not in mice vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/Flu WPV. Gene expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in PBS and Flu WPV groups were highest at 3 dpi and reduced at 5 dpi, which showed similar kinetics with the lung viral titers. Conversely, gene expression levels in the animals vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/Flu WPV, either showed no difference with the non-infected control group or were mildly induced at 3 dpi, such as Il10, Cxcl10, and Ccl2, but these were much lower than PBS and Flu WPV groups. Collectively, these results demonstrated the protectivity of Co/Flu WPV against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is comparable to that of Co WPV, in aspects of suppressing viral replication and cytokine/chemokine responses in the lung and halting weight loss. However, the beneficial effect of the vaccines on improving pneumonia was not clear. This point was further investigated in the next section.Practical two-in-one vaccine with quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccineSince currently licensed influenza vaccines are available as trivalent or quadrivalent formulations, we prepared Co/qFlu WPV by co-formulating Co WPV with quadrivalent influenza WPV (qFlu WPV) containing antigens for the 2018–2019 flu season; ﻿A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 (IVR-180) (H1N1) pdm09 [A/Singapore (H1N1)], A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (IVR-186) (H3N2) [A/Singapore (H3N2)], B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage) [B/Phuket (Yamagata)] and B/Maryland/15/2016 (NYMC BX-69A) (Victoria lineage) [B/Maryland (Victoria)]. To evaluate its immunogenicity and protective efficacy, BALB/c mice were vaccinated with Co WPV, qFlu WPV, Co/qFlu WPV, or PBS as the control group, and neutralization antibody titers in the collected serum were compared. Neutralizing antibody titers in the serum against all respective influenza virus strains were successfully induced on day 22 from vaccination and comparable (range 40–1280) between animals vaccinated with the qFlu WPV alone or Co/qFlu WPV (Fig. 4a). We also observed induction of neutralizing antibody titers in the serum against SARS-CoV-2 in animals vaccinated with Co WPV and Co/qFlu WPV (range 40–80) while neutralizing antibody titers in control animals were below the detection limit (Fig. 4b). These results show that co-formulated Co/qFlu WPV induces humoral immune responses to their respective viruses without apparent interference with each other.Figure 4Practical two-in-one vaccine with quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. Female BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with Co WPV, qFlu WPV, Co/qFlu WPV, and PBS as the control group (n = 13/group). Sera were collected at 19 days post-vaccination for measurement of neutralizing antibodies against A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 (IVR-180) (H1N1), A/Singapore/INFIMH-16–0019/2016 (IVR-186) (H3N2), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage) and, B/Maryland/15/2016 (NYMC BX-69A) (Victoria lineage) (a), and SARS-CoV-2 (b). Mean and SD are shown. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests. **p < 0.01(a), **p < 0.01 (b). At 22 days post-vaccination, the animals were challenged with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 MA-P10. Following virus challenge, body weight change was monitored (c) and lung viral loads were measured at 3 and 5 dpi (d and e). Mean and SD are shown. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests. **p < 0.01. Some lung tissues were harvested at 10 dpi for lung pathology and immunohistochemistry (f). For histopathological analysis, lung sections were stained with H&E, and immunohistochemistry was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and macrophage (F4/80) and neutrophil (Ly-G6) markers. Each lung section is a representative of 3 lung sections analysed.Full size imageWe subsequently investigated the protectivity of Co/qFlu WPV against SARS-CoV-2 infection challenge, in which the experimental duration was extended up to 10 days to observe the vaccine effect on disease severity at the later phase. Following inoculation of 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 MA-P10 at day 22 post-vaccination, mice vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/qFlu WPV showed no weight loss, while all control animals and mice vaccinated with qFlu WPV showed steep weight loss until 4 dpi and then slowly recovered, although qFlu WPV-vaccinated animals begun recovery of body weight earlier than the PBS group (Fig. 4c). Lung virus titers of animals in the PBS and qFlu WPV groups had on average 2 × 107 and 1.9 × 107 PFU at 3 dpi, and 5.5 × 105 and 6.2 × 105 PFU at 5 dpi, respectively (Fig. 4d,e). In contrast, mice vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/qFlu WPV had lower viral loads after virus challenge at 3 and 5 dpi. Consistently, immunostaining analyses revealed lower signals of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid in the lungs of animals vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/qFlu WPV, compared to animals vaccinated with PBS or qFlu WPV at 3 and 5 dpi (Supplemental Fig. S4a and b). Of note, the protectivity against SARS-CoV-2 MA-P10 exhibited by Co/Flu WPV and Co/qFlu WPV was similar, suggesting co-formulation of Co WPV with monovalent or quadrivalent vaccines may not affect protectivity from COVID-19.As the next step, we examined the effect of vaccines on infection-induced lung pathology at early to later stages by analyzing H&E-stained lung sections collected at 3, 5, and 10 dpi. At 3 and 5 dpi, the lungs showed massive accumulation of immune effector cells, thickening of the alveolar wall, sloughing of the bronchial epithelium, deposition of necrotic debris, and peri-vascular cuffing in all mice regardless of vaccination status (Supplemental Figs. S3a and b), which was consistent with the histopathological findings in the first SARS-CoV-2 challenge experiment described with monovalent vaccines (Fig. 3d). Moreover, there was no difference in histology scores of the infected lungs among groups at 3 and 5 dpi (Supplemental Fig. S4a). We also assessed the frequency of macrophages and neutrophils in lung sections by immunostaining using anti-F4/80 and anti-Ly-6G antibodies, respectively. Relative to the non-infected control animals, all infected animals had increased numbers of macrophages (F4/80+ cells) at 3 dpi with the highest numbers in Co/qFlu-vaccinated animals (1057 ± 198.3; Supplemental Fig. S3a and S4b) At 5 dpi, the macrophages increased further in all vaccinated animals except for those vaccinated with the Co/qFlu WPV which showed a slight decrease compared to 3 dpi (means of 1057 at 3 dpi vs 864.6 at 5 dpi; Supplemental Fig. S3b and S4b). On the other hand, the frequency of neutrophils (Ly-6G+ cells) was higher in PBS control and qFlu WPV-vaccinated animals than in Co WPV- or Co/qFlu-vaccinated animals at 3 and 5 dpi (Supplemental Fig.S3 and 4c). Therefore, from the findings of histopathology and immunostaining, it was suggested that the protective effect of vaccination with Co WPV regardless of co-formulation with influenza monovalent or quadrivalent WPVs on lung pathology may not be apparent during the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.On the other hand, the effect of Co WPV or Co/qFlu WPV on the lung histological changes was clearly observed at 10 dpi, the later phase of the disease (Fig. 4f and Supplemental Fig. S4a). PBS control animals and those vaccinated with qFlu WPV showed severe lung inflammation than at early time points, even when body weight was on a way to recovery, as indicated by thickened alveolar walls, marked deposition of debris in alveolar spaces, vascular damage, and higher frequency of macrophages than at early time points. While the difference in the numbers of macrophages at 10 dpi between groups did not reach significance, those in the Co WPV and Co/qFlu WPV groups had approximately half the number recorded at 5 dpi while the numbers in the PBS and qFlu WPV were similar to those recorded at 5 dpi (Fig. 4f and Supplemental Fig. S4b). Ly-6G+ cells in all vaccinated animals however returned to baseline levels by 10 dpi as in the non-infected control animals (Supplemental Fig. S4c). In contrast, lung tissues collected from animals vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/qFlu WPV showed much less inflammation than control animals (Fig. 4f and Supplemental Fig. S4a). Altogether, vaccination with Co/Flu and Co/qFlu WPV significantly reduces the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice and ameliorates SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage.Induction of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodiesUnder selection pressure of host immunity induced by infections or vaccinations with previous prevalent strains, novel strains that could evade established immunity have been continuously emerging: several strains had been defined as variants of concern (VOCs) by the WHO. Emergence of VOCs has been a major challenge in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to determine whether our vaccine formulations mount effective antibody responses against some SARS-CoV-2 VOCs following a two-dose regimen. For this purpose, BALB/c mice were vaccinated with Co WPV, qFlu WPV, or Co/qFlu WPV at day 0 and day 22. Serum samples were collected 14 days after the second vaccination to evaluate neutralizing antibodies against the Ancestral, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.6.17.2), and Omicron (BA.5) strains (Fig. 5). After two doses, very high neutralizing antibodies were generated against the Ancestral and Alpha variant in animals vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/qFlu WPV reaching mean values of 2560 and 2463 against the Ancestral strain and 2048 and 1808 against the Alpha variant, respectively. We also detected reasonable levels of neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta variant with means of 304 and 256 in animals vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/qFlu WPV, respectively. In contrast, neutralizing antibody titers against the Omicron variant were very low (means of 28 and 32 for Co WPV and Co/qFlu WPV, respectively), and in some animals, the levels were below the detection limit, aligning with human data that a two-dose vaccine regimen may not be sufficient to mount robust humoral immunity against the Omicron variants. Not surprisingly, neutralizing antibody titers in animals inoculated with PBS or qFlu WPV were below the detection limit against all viruses tested. Nonetheless, these results suggest that Co/qFlu WPV can induce cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers.Figure 5Cross-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Female BALB/c mice were immunized twice subcutaneously with Co WPV, qFlu WPV, Co/qFlu WPV, or PBS as the control group at day 0 and day 19 (n = 5/group). Sera were collected 2 weeks after the second vaccination (36 days after initial vaccination) for measurement of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Ancestral strain and Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (BA.5) variants. Mean and SD are shown. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests. **p < 0.01.Full size imageDiscussionSince the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines have been used primarily in developed countries such as the United States and Europe. Like seasonal influenza, COVID-19 has spread globally, and annual vaccination is discussed. Given the ease of mRNA vaccine production, such as in vitro synthetic capability and the fact that they can be produced once the genetic information is known, mRNA vaccines are very useful vaccines in the early phase of pandemics of novel viruses that have yet to be well characterized. However, mRNA vaccines may not be suitable for use as annual vaccines because of their strong adverse reactions as well as cold chain problems35,36,37. Therefore, there is a need for safe, easy-handling, and effective vaccine options other than mRNA vaccines. In this study, we report the development of a two-in-one vaccine against COVID-19 and seasonal influenza in terms of immunogenicity and protective efficacy in BALB/c mice.Although several inactivated COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and demonstrated immunogenicity and protectivity in animals and humans38,39,40,41, there are scant data demonstrating protection after a single vaccination and without the use of adjuvants. In our study, we showed that a single inoculation of unadjuvanted COVID-19 WPVs significantly prevented body weight loss, gene induction of pro-inflammatory molecules, and reduced virus titers in the lungs following SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that our vaccine is sufficiently immunogenic and protective in mice, comparable to other studies using approved inactivated COVID-19 vaccines. The immunogenicity and protectivity of Flu WPV were comparable to those of the seasonal influenza vaccines used in our previous studies32,42,43, thereby further validating our vaccine design, product quality, and reliability. Furthermore, given comparable antibody titers in mice vaccinated with co-formulated WPV and individual WPVs against both viruses, co-formulation of either monovalent or quadrivalent Flu WPV with Co WPV does not seem to interfere with each other in inducing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza viruses. It is consistent with several studies in humans reporting the concomitant administration of licensed inactivated trivalent or quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines with currently used COVID-19 vaccines30,44,45,46,47. Co-administration of either BNT162b244, mRNA-1273 47, ChAdOx1 nCoV-1944, BBIBP-CorV45, with quadrivalent seasonal influenza viruses reported no safety concerns or interference in immunogenicity except for the NVX-CoV237346 and CoronaVac30. Regarding these vaccines, it has been reported that a mild reduction in anti- spike protein IgG was demonstrated after administering NVX-CoV2373 with quadrivalent influenza vaccine particularly after the first dose while in the CoronaVac study a mild reduction in antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was observed mainly after the second dose of CoronaVac co-administration with quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Yet, in both studies the vaccine immunogenicity in terms of antibody induction using a co-formulation regimen was still considered sufficient, and the clinical relevance of the moderate reductions remain to be investigated. In all the above studies, COVID-19 and influenza vaccines were administered separately in contralateral arms on the same day or on different dates. On the other hand, our study directly demonstrated a possibility that COVID-19 and influenza vaccines can be co-formulated and simultaneously administered to induce robust immune responses. A vaccination strategy utilizing a single vaccine with influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 antigens, as in our study, may be more advantageous in terms of improving the timely delivery of vaccines and minimizing stress on the healthcare system, particularly during mass campaigns or in developing or remote communities while maintaining the immunogenicity of individual vaccines.It is important to note that unadjuvanted 9 µg total protein of each virus antigen was administered in this study which is much higher than other reported COVID-19 inactivated vaccines10,38,39,40,41. While we have previously shown the efficacy of influenza WPV at lower doses29, further studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of the COVID-19 WPV at doses lower than 9 µg. In addition, considering that our vaccine is a whole virus, the ability to induce antibodies against other viral proteins such as the N protein, which have been shown to contribute to improved control of SARS-CoV-2, needs to be investigated48,49.Although influenza-induced pneumonia was effectively blocked by Flu WPV and Co/Flu WPV in the challenge experiment of this study, the beneficial effect of either Co WPV, Co/Flu WPV, or Co/qFlu WPV on pathological changes after SARS-CoV-2 infection was not observed at early time points (3 and 5 dpi). The higher virus PFU used in the SARS-CoV-2 challenge experiment compared to that used in the influenza virus challenge (105 PFU vs 3000 PFU) coupled with lower neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 compared to those against influenza viruses (40–160 for SARS-CoV-2 vs 320–640 for influenza virus on average) may partly explain the differences in lung pathology. However, subsequent experiments demonstrated the beneficial effects of our vaccines at the later stage (10 dpi) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. At this stage, mice in the PBS control and Flu WPV groups showed severe signs of pneumonia with massive infiltration of macrophages although the reduced weight had restored to over 95% of the original weight and animals had undetectable viral antigens in the lungs, as observed in the COVID-19 hamster model at 9 dpi50. In contrast, mice vaccinated with Co WPV or Co/q WPV showed lesser tissue damage and a low frequency of macrophages in the lung similar to those in uninfected mice, which suggests the earlier resolution of inflammatory responses. It is considered that the efficient reduction of virus replication at early time points, owing to the presence of protective immunity in animals vaccinated with Co WPV and Co/qFlu, attenuated subsequent inflammatory responses and production of chemokines and cytokines, thereby inhibiting aggressive and prolonged pneumonia.Immune cross-reactivity is one of the key features required for successful COVID-19 vaccines. Two doses of the two-in-one Co/qFlu WPV based on the Ancestral strain were demonstrated to highly induce antibodies against the Alpha strain followed by the Delta strain in this study, as with previous studies investigating combined COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in mouse models using platforms of lipid nano particle-encapsulated mRNA vaccine17,51 and adenovirus-based vaccine containing expression vector for SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain fused to the stalk of influenza HA17,51. Currently, the most dominant strain circulating around the world is the Omicron variant which has the highest number of amino acid substitutions, deletions, and insertions in the spike protein leading to reduced neutralization by antibodies reactive to the Ancestral strain52. Indeed it is reported that two doses of the licensed COVID-19 vaccines are not sufficient to neutralize this variant53,54. This is similar to our study's result that the co-formulated Co/qFlu WPV induced very low–undetectable antibodies against the Omicron. Data on the induction of cross-reactive antibodies against Omicron by co-formulated/co-administered COVID-19 and influenza vaccines are not yet reported, however, previous studies have revealed that neutralizing capacity of antibodies induced by approved COVID-19 vaccines administered alone can be improved by three-dose vaccination regimens in naïve individuals or two-dose-regimen in COVID-19 convalescents55,56,57. Therefore, annual vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines comprising predominating variants may become necessary, recapitulating the need for co-formulated COVID-19 and seasonal influenza vaccines. In conclusion, our findings present a significant step in the development of a dual purpose COVID-19 and influenza vaccine. Further research, pre-clinical and clinical trials are needed to refine and validate the two-in-one vaccine bringing us closer to an efficient strategy to combat these respiratory infections.Materials and methodsCells and virusesRPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used to grow Mardine-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2)-expressing Vero E6 (Vero TMPRSS2) cells, respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; GE Healthcare UK Ltd, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK), 1 mM of sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 50 μM of 2-mercaptoethanol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 100 U/mL of penicillin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 20 μg/mL of gentamicin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). These cells were used for the neutralization and plaque assays. Influenza viruses A/California (H1N1), ﻿A/Singapore (H1N1), A/Singapore (H3N2), B/Phuket (Yamagata), and B/Maryland (Victoria), SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 (Ancestral strain), Alpha (B.1.1.7, QHN002), Delta (B.1.617.2, TY11-927), and Omicron (BA.5, TY41-702) variants were kindly provided by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan. The mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA-P10 was kindly provided by Dr. Sato (Shionogi & Co., Ltd, Osaka, Japan) and Dr. Sawa (Hokkaido University). Influenza viruses were propagated in 10-day embryonated chicken eggs while SARS-CoV-2 was propagated in Vero TMPRRS2 cells. Following the propagation of influenza viruses in embryonated eggs, the allantoic fluids were harvested and stored at –80 °C until use. SARS-CoV-2 was propagated in Vero TMPRSS2 cells and the culture supernatant was harvested and then stored at − 80 °C until use.VaccinesCo WPV was prepared from the SARS-CoV-2 Ancestral strain. The virus was propagated in Vero TMPRRS2 and after 2 days of culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2, centrifugation was performed at 800 g, 4 °C for 30 min for debris clarification. Then 10% formaldehyde was added to the supernatant (final concentration of 0.1%) and incubated for one week at 4 °C for virus inactivation. Following inactivation, the virus was concentrated by centrifugation at 53,900 g, 4 °C for 2 h then purified by sucrose density ultracentrifugation at 107,000 g, 4 °C for 1.5 h. The total protein concentration was measured using ﻿Nanodrop One spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Flu WPV was prepared from A/California (H1N1) as previously described43. qFlu WPV containing the 2018–2019 virus strains [A/Singapore (H1N1), A/Singapore (H3N2), B/Phuket (Yamagata), B/Maryland (Victoria)] was kindly provided by KM biologics Co. Ltd (Kumamoto, Japan). Co WPV was mixed with Flu WPV or qFlu WPV to produce a two-in-one vaccine (Co/Flu WPV or Co/qFlu WPV) containing equal amounts of protein from each vaccine.AnimalsSix-week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Hokudo, Co., Ltd. (Sapporo, Japan), and housed in BSL-2 and BSL-3 animal rooms at the International Institute for Zoonosis Control under standard laboratory conditions (temperature of 22 °C ± 2 °C, humidity of 50% ± 10%, and a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle). All mice were given food pellets (CE-2; CLEA Japan, Sapporo, Japan) and water ad libitum. All mice experiments were performed under the approval (approval number:20–0070) of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Hokkaido University following Fundamental Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiment and Related Activities in Academic Research Institutions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan. This study was carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines.Vaccination and serum collectionSeven-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated once or twice subcutaneously with PBS as a control or either WPV containing 9 µg protein of each viral antigen; Co WPV, Flu WPV, qFlu WPV, Co/Flu WPV, or Co/qFlu WPV. Sera were collected at 19 days (for one dose) or 36 days (for two doses) post-first vaccination from the caudal vena cava after euthanasia for measuring neutralizing antibody titers.Virus neutralization assayThe neutralization assay was performed to measure neutralizing antibody titers in the serum of vaccinated mice as previously described for influenza viruses42,43. To measure neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2, monolayers of Vero TMPRSS2 cells were prepared in 6-well plates by seeding 1.425 × 106 cells/well in 3 mL DMEM and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Mouse sera were inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min and serially diluted two-fold in 96-well microplates to which 100 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing of Vero TMPRSS2 cells with DMEManti, (containing ﻿100 U/mL of penicillin, 100 μg/mL of streptomycin, and 20 μg/mL of gentamicin) the virus-serum mixture was transferred to 6-well plates containing the Vero TMPRSS2 cells and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2, with shaking every 15 min. Finally, ﻿warmed L15 overlay medium [consisting of Leibovitz L-15 (Life Technologies Corp., Carlsbad, NY, USA) with glutamine supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 0.028% (w/v) NaHCO3 and 0.9% (w/v) agarose] was added to the 6-well plates. The plates were incubated for three days at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and the neutralizing antibody titer was determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that prevented the growth of plaques to 50% of that obtained in the control wells.Virus challenge and measurement of viral loadsVaccinated mice were inoculated with either 3000 PFU of A/California (H1N1) [3000 PFU ~ 40 × 50% mouse lethal dose 50 (40 MLD50)] or 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 MA-P1033 (sublethal dose) intranasally 22 days after vaccination and monitored daily for body weight changes. At 3 and 5 dpi, some mice were humanely euthanized, and lung tissues (right lobes) were harvested for measurement of virus titers and gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Influenza viral loads in the lungs were determined as described previously32,43. To measure the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, monolayers of Vero TMPRSS2 cells were prepared by seeding 1.425 × 106 cells in 3 mL DMEM and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Homogenized lung samples were diluted tenfold (10−1–10−3) and then transferred to 6-well plates containing a monolayer of Vero TMPRSS2 cells. The neutralization assay protocol outlined above was followed for the remaining plaque assay. Following incubation for 3 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2, visible plaques were counted manually, and the number of PFUs was determined.Measurement of gene expression levels using real-time RT-PCRFresh lung tissues (right lobes) were collected at necropsy, placed in TRIzol (ZYMO Research, Orange, CA, USA), homogenized using stainless beads by Micro Smash (MS-100/100R; Wakenyaku Co., ltd., Kyoto, Japan), and stored at –80 °C until use. Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instruction using the classical chloroform/isopropanol precipitation method, and the RNA concentrations were measured by Nanodrop One spectrophotometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific). The extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific) to prepare cDNA. The synthesized cDNA was subjected to real-time PCR reactions for quantification of gene expression levels of Csf2, Csf3, Il1b, Il6, Il10, Ifng, Tnf, Cxcl10, Ccl2, Icam1 by using a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and QIAGEN Quantinova SYBR green PCR kit (QIAGEN, Hilden Germany). The primers used in this study are shown in Supplemental Table 1. The relative expression levels of target genes were normalized in each sample by those of ribosomal 18S and non-infected control samples and then calculated as the fold change (2–∆∆Ct).Histopathology and immunohistochemistryLung samples (left lobe) were harvested from non-infected control mice and from infected mice at 3, 5, and 10 dpi and fixed in masked formalin (Japan Tanner, Osaka, Japan) for 7 or 10 days at room temperature. For histopathological analyses, the tissues were paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained with H&E. Immunostaining was performed for the detection of viral antigens and inflammatory cell markers (monocytes and neutrophils). Unstained paraffin-embedded lung sections were immersed in Trilogy (Cell Marque, Sierra College Boulevard, Rockline, California) for deparaffinization and antigen retrieval in an antigen retriever (2100 Antigen Retriever; Aptum Biologics, Southampton, UK). To block endogenous peroxidase, sections were placed in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corp., Tokyo, Japan) in methanol (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 20 min at room temperature after which they were probed with anti-influenza A, B (1:2000, M149, rabbit polyclonal antibody; TaKaRa Bio inc., Shiga, Japan), anti-nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (1:1000, HL344, rabbit monoclonal antibody; GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA), anti-F4/80 (1:500, 70076, rabbit monoclonal antibody; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts, USA) or anti-Ly-6G (1:500, 87048, rabbit monoclonal antibody; Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following washing with 0.01 M PBS (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corp.) three times, sections were incubated with TaKaRa POD conjugate (MK205, anti-rabbit Ig-Fab-peroxidase conjugate; TAKARA Bio. Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with 0.01 M PBS, the sections were incubated with TaKaRa DAB substrate (TaKaRa Bio. Inc.) for 5 min at room temperature and then placed in distilled water to stop the reaction. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin (Mayer’s Hematoxylin Solution; Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corp.) for 30 min. Finally, the sections were washed with running water, dehydrated with isopropanol. A small amount of a permanent mounting medium (VectaMount Express, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) was added and the slides were then covered with a coverslip.The degree of lung damage was assessed by examining 10 randomly selected fields on H&E-stained sections from each mouse using the established criteria58,59,60 as follows: 0, normal lung; 1, mild destruction of epithelium of the bronchus; 2, mild infiltration of inflammatory cells around the periphery of bronchioles; 3, moderate infiltration of inflammatory cells around the alveolar walls resulting in alveolar thickening; 4, mild alveolar injury accompanied by vascular damage of ≤ 10%; 5, moderate alveolar and vascular injury (11% to approximately 30%); 6, severe alveolar injury with hyaline membrane–associated alveolar haemorhage (31% to approximately 50%); and 7, severe alveolar injury with hyaline membrane-associated alveolar hemorrhage of ≥ 51%. Lung sections from each mouse were assessed and scored individually, and the cumulative total average of 10 areas was reflected as the score for each mouse. The frequencies of macrophages and neutrophils in lung sections were quantified by QuPath bioimage analysis software61.Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10 software. Data are presented as mean with SD. Normality of distribution was checked by Shapiro–Wilk test then data were analysed by Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test, two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak’s multiple comparison test, and Mann–Whitney test. For multiple comparisons test, each group was compared with every other group. Significant difference was denoted by p values < 0.05. ReferencesKoutsakos, M., Wheatley, A. K., Laurie, K., Kent, S.

Flu upticks in multiple regions Though the national test positivity declined a bit, to 14.8% of respiratory virus samples, the percentage of outpatient visits for flulike illness held steady at 4.5%, the CDC said in its weekly FluView update. Regional patterns, though, show a mixed picture, with five regions—the Northeast, New England, the Middle Atlantic, the Midwest, and the Central states—experiencing increased activity last week. Test positivity also varied by region, with higher levels in the Northeast, Middle Atlantic, and Central regions. Influenza B activity, which often rises in the later flu season months, stayed level last week. Of respiratory samples that tested positive for flu at public health labs last week, 71.7% were influenza A and 28.3% were influenza B. Of subtyped flu A samples, 51.3% were the 2009 H1N1 strain and 48.7% were H3N2. Hospitalization indicators remained stable and have been decreasing since the first of the year, the CDC said. Overall deaths from flu rose last week, and the CDC received reports of 9 more pediatric flu deaths, raising the season's total to 91. The deaths occurred between November and the first weeks of February. Five were linked to the H1N1 virus, and four were related to influenza B. COVID markers continue to fall In its latest data updates today, the CDC said both severity markers for COVID—hospitalizations and deaths—declined last week. Hospitalizations remain elevated in seniors and infants ages 12 months and younger. Early indicators also show downward trends, with the nation's test positivity rate at 8.1%. The rate is a bit higher in the southeast than in other parts of the country. Also, emergency department visits declined 12.4% from the previous week. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 detections, another early signal, remained high. For the week ending February 17, detections are much higher in the southern region than in the rest of the country. RSV situation continues to improve Meanwhile, RSV levels continue to decline in many areas, and hospitalizations levels are dropping for both infants and seniors, the CDC said in its weekly respiratory virus snapshot. Deaths from RSV remained stable.

In order to better understand the pathobiology of this viral infection in bustards, a comprehensive pathological characterization was performed. A total of six birds were selected for necropsy, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, RNAscope in situ hybridization and RT-qPCR and nanopore sequencing on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks. Gross lesions included mottled and/or hemorrhagic pancreas, spleen and liver and fibrinous deposits on air sacs and intestine. Necrotizing pancreatitis, splenitis and concurrent vasculitis, hepatitis and fibrino-heterophilic peritonitis were identified, microscopically. Viral antigens (nucleoprotein) and RNAs (matrix gene) were both detected within necro-inflammatory foci, parenchymal cells, stromal cells and endothelial cells of affected organs, including the myenteric plexus. Molecular analysis of FFPE blocks successfully detected HPAI H5N8, further confirming its involvement in the lesions observed. In conclusion, HPAI H5N8 in African houbara bustards results in hyperacute/acute forms exhibiting marked pantropism, endotheliotropism and neurotropism. In addition, our findings support the use of FFPE tissues for molecular studies of poorly characterized pathogens in exotic and endangered species, when availability of samples is limited.

Since 2002, mortality events associated with Gs/Gd HPAI viruses, especially from clade 2.3.4.4b, have been reported in an variety of avian species, including endangered ones1. A few recent examples include the demise of more than 6500 Cape cormorants (Phalacrocorax capensis) and 350 African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) in Namibia, the loss of 750 great white pelicans (Pelecanus onocrotalus) belonging to the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary, near the Senegal–Mauritania border and massive die-offs involving breeding populations of great skuas (Stercorarius skua) in Great Britain3,4,5,6,7.Numerous avian species are the object of captive breeding and reinforcement programs, actively engaged in preserving and restoring wild populations. From this point, a remarkable example is provided by the African houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata) a terrestrial bird inhabiting the semi-desertic regions of North Africa and Canary Islands, classified as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature8. As a result, several conservation breeding projects have been established in North Africa and United Arab Emirates. Infectious diseases represent a significant threat for captive-breeding and release programs, potentially impairing repopulation efforts on multiple levels: loss of valuable individuals, including breeding adults, reduced breeding success and survival rates, local spread of harmful pathogens following the exposure of native wild populations to harmful pathogens associated with the translocation of infected individuals for restocking purposes9,10,11,12. Predator and scavenger species may also be threatened, due to the consumption of infected animals13,14,15. Additional risks arise from the rehabilitation of illegally traded birds into the wild or their introduction within captive breeding projects16. Quarantine measures, routine health monitoring and screening, are essential to properly understand sanitary issues and implement the most effective control measures, especially in species for which the presentation of a variety of pathogens is still poorly described16. From this point of view, necropsy findings can provide useful insights, guiding the diagnostic process, through target sampling17,18,19.The clinico-pathological picture of HPAI can vary significantly, due to both virus-related and host-related factor20,21. While our knowledge on the pathobiological features of HPAI infection in captive and, to a lesser extent, wild bird species have been expanded by a variety of research works, available literature on bustards is still limited7,13,15,18,21,22,23,24.To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first pathological description of H5N8 HPAI natural infection in captive African houbara bustards in the United Arab Emirates, including an overview of viral tissue distribution based on two different in situ detection techniques and the use of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples for molecular analysis.Materials and methodsSelection of birds belonging to a H5N8 HPAI outbreakIn November 2020, an outbreak of H5N8 HPAI was registered in a flock of captive African houbara bustards, part of a breeding conservation project established in the United Arab Emirates (International Fund for Houbara Conservation)25 Affected birds, all vaccinated against H5N2 (inactivated vaccine) 4.5 months before, ranged between 18 to 32 months of age (average 22 months) and were housed in outdoor pens, including 4–7 bird each, for a total of 314 individuals. Starting from November 25th, over a 7 days period, 8 birds belonging to 6 different pens died. Of these, 6 were found dead without exhibiting clinical signs, while 2 appeared mildly lethargic 24–48 h prior to the exitus. An additional bird exhibited similar signs for 24 h. Due to the drastic decline of its conditions, a decision was made by the veterinarian and the bird was humanely euthanized by intravenous injection of T-61.H5N8 HPAI infection was confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) targeting the subtype H5 of hemagglutinin (HA) and by HA and neuraminidase (NA) sequencing on swabs (oropharyngeal and cloacal) and fresh tissue sections (lung and spleen). Among the eight birds that died spontaneously, six birds were randomly selected for pathological investigation, including four birds experiencing hyperacute death (three males and one female) and two symptomatic individuals (one male and one female).Pathology and viral tissue distributionA complete necropsy was performed within 48 h after the exitus. For histopathology, sections of trachea, lung, heart, liver, spleen, pancreas, gizzard, small and large intestine, cecal tonsils, kidney and ovary were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, paraffin-embedded and sectioned at 3 µm. Slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined by light microscopy. Necrotic-inflammatory lesions were scored according to severity26.For viral tissue distribution, serial sections, 3 µm-thick, were obtained FFPE tissues, mounted on charged slides and stained with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH). The immunohistochemical assay was performed using a monoclonal mouse antibody directed against influenza A virus (IAV) nucleoprotein (NP) (Clone HB65, FCG013, Kerafast, Boston). Sections of IAV positive tissues were used as positive controls. Negative controls included sections incubated without the primary antibody or with another monoclonal antibody belonging to the same isotype (IgG2). The RNAscope ISH assay relied on a custom-designed probe (V-H5N8-M1M2) targeting the well-conserved influenza matrix protein genes (M gene) 1 and 2 of HPAIV (H5N8) Clade 2.3.4.4b (A/chicken/France/20P016448/2020) following the RNAscope® 2.5 HD Assay RED (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA)27,28. A probe targeting the dihydrodipicolinate reductase gene from the Bacillus subtilis strain SMY, served as negative control, while sections of AIV positive tissues were used as positive controls. Parenchymal and endothelial immunoreactivity of each organ were scored according to distribution for both techniques26.Molecular analysis on FFPE tissue blocksA total of 4 FFPE tissue blocks, obtained from 3 birds and including sections of liver, spleen, pancreas and intestine exhibiting necrotic-inflammatory lesions and positive immunostaining, were selected for molecular analysis. RNA was extracted using the FormaPure XL RNA Kit (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA), following manufacturer’s recommendations. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of extracted RNA and DV200 assessment were conducted using high-throughput, automated electrophoresis (Tapestation 4200, Agilent). Subsequently, RT-qPCR targeting AIV H5 was performed (Influenza H5/H7 ID Gene PCR kit, IDVet), followed by HA and NA sequencing using the MinION Mk1C device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) according to the protocol detailed by Croville et al.29.ResultsGross pathologySelected birds were mostly in good nutritional status (5/6 birds). The pancreas was diffusely enlarged, firm and mottled (4/6) or hemorrhagic (2/6) (Fig. 1a). The liver was diffusely enlarged, pale and firm (5/6) or friable (1/6). The spleen was enlarged and mottled with a gritty consistency (5/6) or hemorrhagic (1/6) (Fig. 1b). Multiple, pale foci, 1 to 3 mm (mm) in diameter, were visible on the surface of liver (5/6) and spleen (3/6). Kidneys were diffusely congested (4/6) or pale and swollen (2/6). The glottis (2/6), tracheal mucosa (4/6) and lungs (3/6) were markedly congested and edematous (Fig. 1c), while white fibrinous plaques were present in the oropharynx (3/6). Yellow fibrinous exudate was covering the thoracic and abdominal air sacs, extending to the surface of the small intestine and pancreas (3/6) (Fig. 1d). Multifocal to coalescing petechial hemorrhages were identified in the ovary (1/6), gizzard’s mucosa and underneath the koilin (1/6), the mucosa of the small intestine and cecal tonsils (2/6). Occasional ulcers were noticed in the cecal tonsils and colon mucosa (1/6). Mild hydropericardium was present in one bird.Figure 1Necropsy findings in African houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata) naturally-infected with H5N8 HPAIV. Mottled pancreas with multiple hemorrhagic foci (arrowheads) (a). Diffusely enlarged and mottled spleen with multiple necrotic foci (arrowheads) (b). Diffusely congested and edematous lungs (c). Accumulation of yellow fibrinous exudate on the surface of the small intestine (duodenum) (d).Full size imageHistopathologyResults are summarized in Table 1. The spleen revealed severe necrotizing vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis (4/4) and concurrent fibrino-heterophilic inflammation (3/4) (Fig. 2a). The pancreas exhibited mild to severe, parenchymal degeneration and lytic necrosis, with no to minimal mononuclear inflammation (5/5) (Fig. 2b). Hepatic lesions included diffuse macrovesicular steatosis (2/3), mild to moderate, multifocal lytic necrosis, with no to minimal mononuclear inflammation (3/3) and occasional fibrino-heterophilic exudation (1/3) (Fig. 2c). In the small intestine, the serosa was covered with large amounts of fibrino-heterophilic exudate, extending to the mesentery (1/2) (Fig. 2d). Several necrotic areas were scattered in the mucosa and submucosa, extending to the tunica muscularis (1/2). The tunica muscularis was also markedly expanded by lymphoplasmacells, occasionally organized in follicular structures exhibiting necrotic changes (1/2). Rare ulcers, were identified in the mucosa of ceca and colon-rectum (1/2). Moderate to marked generalized congestion was the only remarkable finding in the urogenital system (1/1) (Fig. 2e–f) and respiratory tract (3/3), while no lesions were observed in gizzard and heart sections (1/1).Table 1 Clinico-pathological findings and viral tissue distribution by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) in African houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata) naturally-infected with H5N8 HPAIV (n = 6).Full size tableFigure 2Histopathological lesions identified in African houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata) naturally-infected with H5N8 HPAIV. Tissue sections are stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E). Necrotic-inflammatory changes, ranging from multifocal to diffuse (arrowheads and asterisks) are present in spleen (a) pancreas (b) liver (c) and intestine (d). Generalized congestion predominated in ovary (e) and kidney (f). Scale bars: 100 μm (a–c, f) and 300 μm (d, e).Full size imageIn situ detection of avian influenza virusResults of viral tissue distribution and immunoreactivity are summarized in Tables 1, and 2. Viral antigens and RNAs were detected as intranuclear and intracytoplasmic staining in all tissues examined, except for the heart. For IHC, positive immunostaining was identified in liver sections within the hepatocytes (3/3), endothelial cells (3/3), cholangiocytes (2/3), periportal mononuclear leukocytes (2/3), stromal cells and mesothelial cells lining the Glisson’s capsule (1/3). In the pancreas, intact or necrotic acinar cells (5/5) followed by Langerhans’ islets cells and ductal epithelial cells (2/5) and occasional endothelial cells (4/5) appeared immunoreactive (Fig. 3a). Splenic sections showed multifocal to widespread positivity within the necrotic and fibrino-heterophilic foci (4/4), endothelial cells in both arterioles and penicillar capillaries (4/4), mononuclear leukocytes located in the white and red pulp (4/4), germinal centers (2/4), capsular smooth muscle cells (2/4) and ellipsoidal reticular cells (1/4) (Fig. 3b). In the intestine, viral antigen detection ranged from multifocal positive areas scattered within the lamina propria and neuronal cells of the myenteric plexus (3/4) to widespread immunoreactivity involving several compartments (1/4). In this case, positivity was recorded in smooth muscles cells in the lamina propria, muscularis mucosae and tunica muscularis, neuronal cells in the myenteric plexus, necrotic-inflammatory areas, as well as mononuclear leukocytes, endothelial cells and enterocytes (Fig. 3c–d). In the gizzard, the myenteric plexus was also positive, together with occasional endothelial cells in the lamina propria, and the interstitium of submucosa and tunica muscularis (1/1). In the ovary, endothelial and stromal cells of the vascular zone, followed by thecal cells and mesothelial cells, were highly positive (1/1) (Fig. 3e). Renal epithelial cells, in both cortical regions and medullary tracts, revealed large amounts of viral NP, while occasional positive cells were detected within glomerular tufts and interstitial blood vessels (1/1) (Fig. 3f). Viral antigen was also present in the ciliated epithelium of trachea (3/3) and secondary bronchi (1/3), tracheal intraluminal debris (1/3) pulmonary capillary bed (3/3) and endothelium of blood vessels in the interparabronchial septa (3/3) (Fig. 3g–h). Positive detection of viral RNA (M gene) by RNAscope ISH exhibited a tissue distribution equivalent to IHC (Fig. 4a–d). Additional positive areas were identified in gizzard (1/1) (mucosal epithelium and endothelial cells in the lamina propria) intestine (3/4) (mesothelial cells, mucosal epithelium, endothelial cells in the lamina propria) pancreas (1/5) (ductal epithelium and necrotic foci) and liver (2/3) (endothelial cells) (Fig. 4e–f).Table 2 Endothelial viral detection by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) in African houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata) naturally-infected with H5N8 HPAIV (n = 6).Full size tableFigure 3Viral antigen tissue distribution in African houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata) naturally-infected with H5N8 HPAIV.

Scale bars: 100 μm (a, b, d), 300 μm (e–f) and 20 μm (c).Full size imageMolecular analysis on FFPE tissue blocksBetween 17.2 and 55.5 ng/µl of RNA (average 30.07 ng/µl) were obtained from 4 selected FFPE blocks. RNA integrity number (RIN) ranged from 5.5 to 7 (average 6.4), while DV200 score varied from 54.62 to 68.08 (average 60.59). AIV H5 was successfully detected by RT-qPCR in all 4 FFPE blocks, with a cycle threshold (Ct) value ranging between 21.23 and 25.05 (average 23.34). Partial sequencing of HA and NA highlighted a cleavage site consistent with HPAI and confirmed the involvement of N8 subtype, respectively (Accessions OR699288 and OR699289).DiscussionWe provided the first comprehensive characterization of H5N8 HPAI natural infection in captive African houbara bustards, enriching available literature on the pathology of HPAI in an endangered avian species. A single report described an outbreak of H5N1 HPAI in Asian houbara bustards (Chlamydotis maqueenii) and falcons, exhibiting neurological signs and diarrhea13. The virus was isolated and molecularly characterized but, besides clinical signs, pathological findings were not provided and viral tissue distribution was not assessed. In another study, necrotizing pancreatitis was mentioned as a hallmark lesion in houbara bustards infected with H7N1 and H5N1 HPAI viruses but no additional details were provided30.The birds included in our study exhibited hyperacute death, or presented with listlessness between 24 and 48 h prior to the exitus. Spleen, liver and pancreas were more commonly affected at necropsy, showing various degrees of degenerative changes, further confirmed at histopathology. Spleen sections also revealed marked fibrinoid necrosis, consistent with vasculitis. IHC and RNAscope ISH successfully highlighted the presence of viral antigen and RNA in the vast majority of the tissues examined. However, compared to IHC, RNAscope ISH appeared to be less affected by autolytic changes, and more sensitive. Positive detection was specifically recorded and consistent with multi-visceral, parenchymal and endothelial cells involvement, supporting a systemic infection and explaining the rapid course of the disease.Interestingly, endothelial immunolabelling varied, in terms of frequency and severity, among affected bustards. A possible explanation for this finding is the fact that, in some individuals, death may have occurred before extensive viral replication within the vascular endothelium20. Compared to Anseriformes, with the exception of the black swan (Cygnus atratus), systemic endotheliotropism with necrotizing vasculitis and hyperacute/acute forms, are considered hallmarks of HPAI virus infection in domestic Galliformes20,31. In chickens, endothelial cells are reported to be more permissive to HPAI virus infection, compared to ducks, due to a lower antiviral response31. An acute course of disease (short mean death time) in chickens is also associated with a reduced viral excretion time. On the other end, ducks have a longer mean death time and shed more virus over the course of the infection32,33. Overall, since several factors may have been involved, including species affected, host genetic polymorphism, course of the disease and concurrent infections, additional studies are needed to properly define the role played by endothelial cells in HPAI infection in bustards34.In terms of tissue distribution, large amounts of AIV were detected in the urogenital tract of bustards, despite the absence of significant lesions, except for generalized congestion. Similarly, H5N1 HPAI was able to replicate in the renal tubular epithelium of both naturally and experimentally-infected waterfowl, without inducing significant changes35,36. However, renal lesions with concurrent positive immunolabelling were reported in wild Baikal teals (Anas Formosa), bean geese (Anser fabalis), and whooper swans (Cygnus Cygnus) and backyard chickens naturally-infected with H5N8 HPAI37,38. The involvement of the reproductive tract was mentioned in different avian species exposed to several HPAI subtypes. H5N8, H5N2 and H5N1 viruses were detected by RT-qPCR and/or IHC in the oviduct, eggshell and internal egg contents of experimentally-infected white leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus)39,40. IHC revealed IAV antigen in the ovarian stroma of commercial meat-type turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) naturally-infected with H5N8 HPAI and in several tissues, including the reproductive tract, of Passeriformes and budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) experimentally-infected with H5N1 HPAI41,42.A limitation of this study was the lack of systematic tissue sampling, regardless the presence of specific clinical signs and/or macroscopic lesions. Non-suppurative, necrotizing encephalitis and myocarditis have been commonly described in a variety of commercial, captive and wild birds, naturally and experimentally-infected with H5N8 HPAI14,15,24,42,43,44. In our case, the presence of cerebral lesions couldn’t be assessed because the nervous system was not collected due to the lack of neurological signs. However, immunoreactivity of the myenteric plexus in the gastrointestinal tract, confirmed by both IHC and RNAscope ISH, still supported a neuronal tropism. Cardiac sections appeared unremarkable although, false negative results may have originated from a non-uniform distribution of lesions and from the fact that only 1/6 birds was sampled.In birds infected with HPAI viral shedding can occur through the respiratory, digestive and urogenital tract20. In addition, due to systemic infection, large amounts of virus are present within a variety of tissues, including musculoskeletal and integumentary systems, making scavenging birds particularly at risk of being exposed following the consumption of infected carcasses13,14,15,20,45,46. Non-respiratory particles, such as dust originating from infected poultry houses, have also been recognized as an important source of infection47,48,49. In our case, two nests belonging to an unidentified waterfowl species, were discovered nearby the first positive pen, making the exposure to infectious aerosol, fecal particles as well as infected feathers and dust, a plausible event.Molecular analysis conducted on FFPE tissue blocks, further confirmed the involvement of H5N8 HPAI in affected bustards. Nucleic acids fragmentation, resulting from formalin-fixation makes short-read sequencing technologies more suitable for FFPE tissues. However, we chose to assess the feasibility of the Oxford Nanopore MinION, a long-read technology, since it can generate real-time results, is economically affordable and portable50. To the author’s best knowledge, this is the first time nanopore sequencing has been used on FFPE samples for veterinary viral investigation. FFPE blocks represent practical samples that can be stored at room temperature and can be easily shipped. They are an invaluable resource of information for retrospective studies, and diagnostic investigation of poorly characterized conditions and unsolved archived cases, which is particularly interesting for exotic and endangered species with a limited availability of samples. In addition, preserved tissue architecture and histomorphological features allow target and custom-designed testing, increasing sensitivity. An example is provided by the molecular identification of Toxocara cati in FFPE blocks obtained from brown kiwis (Apteryx mantelli) with a histopathological diagnosis of visceral and neural larva migrans, between 2004 and 201751. Nevertheless, Gaide et al.28 successfully detected AIVs by RNAscope ISH and IHC in FFPE blocks stored at room temperature between 2009 and 2022, with no detrimental effects on final results.In conclusion, our results show that natural infection with H5N8 HPAI virus in African houbara bustards is characterized by hyperacute/acute forms exhibiting pantropism, as well as endotheliotropism and neurotropism. Significant pathological indicators to be considered at necropsy include necrotizing splenitis, pancreatitis and hepatitis and fibrinous peritonitis. FFPE samples represent a valuable source of nucleic acids for in situ detection and molecular analysis of emerging and re-emerging avian pathogens in poorly characterized species.

Juhan Sonin / Flickr cc The patient is a 17-year-old girl from Kampot province, according to a ministry statement translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease news blog. Kampot province is in southern Cambodia. The girl is hospitalized in the intensive care unit and is improving. An investigation found that about 5 days before the girl's symptoms began, there were seven dead chickens at her home. Cambodia has now reported 5 cases for 2024 and a total of 11 since February 2023, following nearly a decade with no human infections. Genetic sequencing on samples from several cases has revealed that the virus belongs to an older H5N1 clade (2.3.2.1c) that still circulates in poultry in some Asian countries, including Cambodia. It is different from the newer H5N1 clade (2.3.4.4b) that is currently affecting wild birds and poultry in multiple world regions, including the United States. Hong Kong reports imported H9 case Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) today reported an influenza A H9 case, which involves a 22-month-old girl who had recently visited the city of Zhongshan in mainland China's Guangdong province. Her symptoms began on February 15, and she was seen at a hospital the next day but was not admitted. Plans are under way for her to receive care in hospital isolation. An investigation revealed that she had no direct contact with poultry during her incubation period while visiting the mainland, nor did she eat undercooked poultry or have contact with sick people. One of her home contacts had a sore throat on February 17 that subsided. The CHP said novel H9 flu virus infections, including H9N2, are typically mild. Hong Kong has reported nine cases since 1999, and its most recent case—from 2020—was also imported. US study: Disparities in death rates persist after acute phase of pandemic News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 A new research letter in JAMA Network Open demonstrates that pre-COVID disparities in all-cause mortality have largely persisted after the acute phase of the pandemic, as patterns have largely returned to baseline. The study examined annualized age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) among major demographic groups in the United States from March 2018 through May 2023. Sex, race and ethnicity, metropolitan status, and region were all considered. The authors compared mortality ratios between four periods: One year prior to the pandemic, the first and second years of the pandemic (before and after widespread vaccination), and the post-acute Omicron-dominant phase of the pandemic. American Indian, Alaskan Native groups hit harder During the pandemic, mortality rates increased significantly for men, people of color, non-urban residents, and people in the South and West. In almost all groups, levels returned to prepandemic levels by fourth period analyzed. However, the authors said a notable change was that American Indian or Alaska Native ASDRs compared to White mortality was 1.02 (1.01-1.03) to 1.20 (1.18-1.21) or higher in both acute pandemic years. "Death rate ratios during the postacute period generally returned to prepandemic levels," the authors said. "Although mortality remains somewhat higher than before the pandemic, this additional mortality is largely proportional to 2018-2019 mortality with respect to major demographic comparisons. This continuity suggests that these disparities are persistent; even a pandemic-level mortality shock does not permanently alter them. "This continuity suggests that these disparities are persistent; even a pandemic-level mortality shock does not permanently alter them." COVID vaccine mandates may have had unintended consequences, researchers say News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics COVID-19 Lubo Ivanko / iStock US state COVID-19 vaccine mandates didn't significantly change uptake, and states with mandates actually had lower COVID-19 booster and voluntary adult and child flu vaccine coverage than those that banned vaccine requirements, an analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data suggests. Researchers from the University of Arizona at Tucson and Furman University in South Carolina parsed the data to identify changes in COVID-19 vaccination rates and COVID-19 boosters and seasonal flu vaccines in the 2 months before and after implementation of state-level mandates for targeted groups (eg, state employees). Baseline attitudes were collected before the vaccine rollout as part of the COVID States Project. Challenges of promoting public health via vaccines In the 19 states with COVID-19 vaccine mandates, weekly COVID-19 vaccination rates weren't statistically significantly different before and after mandate implementation, and the difference in vaccination rates from before to after mandates didn't depend on baseline attitudes toward the requirements. The authors noted that the analysis wasn't sufficiently powered to detect small effects. A series of multilevel models were tested to compare state-level differences in weekly COVID-19 booster uptake from rollout in November 2021 to May 2022 in mandate states and in the 22 states that outlawed such mandates. The results suggested that the percentage of eligible residents who received a booster was smaller in mandate states than in those that banned mandates. The difference was greater among states with lower vaccination levels. The results underscore the challenges of promoting public health through vaccination. An examination of two CDC datasets on state-level flu vaccination among adults and children in the 2021-22 flu season showed that both adults and children in mandate states were less likely to receive the flu vaccine than those in states with mandate bans. "This research supports the notion that governmental restrictions in the form of vaccination mandates can have unintended negative consequences, not necessarily by reducing uptake of the mandated vaccine, but by reducing adoption of other voluntary vaccines," the study authors wrote. "More broadly, the results underscore the challenges of promoting public health through vaccination."

This study aims to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the impacts of air pollution on influenza and to confirm a better method for infectious disease surveillance. Spearman correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between air pollution and the influenza case counts. VIF was used to test for collinearity among selected air pollutants. OLS regression, GWR, and STWR models were fitted to explore the potential spatiotemporal relationship between air pollution and influenza. The R2, the RSS and the AICc were used to evaluate and compare the models. In addition, the DTW and K-medoids algorithms were applied to cluster the county-level time-series coefficients. Compared with the OLS regression and GWR models, STWR model exhibits superior fit especially when the influenza outbreak changes rapidly and is able to more accurately capture the changes in different regions and time periods. We discovered that identical air pollutant factors may yield contrasting impacts on influenza within the same period in different areas of Fuzhou. NO2 and PM10 showed opposite impacts on influenza in the eastern and western areas of Fuzhou during all periods. Additionally, our investigation revealed that the relationship between air pollutant factors and influenza may exhibit temporal variations in certain regions. From 2013 to 2019, the influence coefficient of O3 on influenza epidemic intensity changed from negative to positive in the western region and from positive to negative in the eastern region. STWR model could be a useful method to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the impacts of air pollution on influenza in geospatial processes. The research findings emphasize the importance of considering spatiotemporal heterogeneity when studying the relationship between air pollution and influenza.

The clinical manifestations of influenza are mainly high fever, fatigue, headache, cough, systemic muscle soreness and other systemic disease symptoms, while respiratory symptoms are mild. Sudden outbreaks and rapid spread cause different degrees of epidemics and are the most significant epidemiological features of influenza2. According to WHO estimates, annual seasonal influenza epidemics can cause 3 to 5 million severe cases and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths related to respiratory diseases worldwide3.As a result, it has become an important public health issue4.The epidemic characteristics of influenza in China are different in the north and south. The peak of influenza in northern China mostly occurs in the cold winter and spring, while that in southern China occurs all year, and peaks mostly occur in winter and summer. However, this is not absolute. For example, Jinan and Tibet have also had small influenza peaks in summer5. An outbreak of influenza will lead to public panic and social and economic depression and seriously affect social stability and healthy development6. Influenza transmission risk factors encompass individual immune susceptibility7, population mobility, meteorological conditions (e.g., low temperatures and reduced ultraviolet radiation)8, and air pollution9.Many previous studies have consistently demonstrated a significant correlation between air pollution and influenza incidence. Su W et al. used wavelet coherence analysis and a generalized Poisson superimposed regression model to study the potential relationship between air pollutant and influenza-like illness (ILI) in Jinan, China, from 2016 to 2017 and found that air pollutant, especially PM2.5, PM10, CO, and SO2, could increase the risk of ILI10. Pascal M et al. found an interaction between temperature and PM10 on respiratory diseases and mortality11. However, not all air pollutant will accelerate influenza. McGee Hargrove M et al. found that high concentrations of O3 can kill influenza virus in the air or on the surface of objects to reduce the spread of influenza without harm to humans12. Song et al. utilized Moran’s I and correlation analysis to examine the spatiotemporal differentiation characteristics of influenza incidence in prefecture-level cities and explore its relationship with air pollution13. However, in these studies, linear regression models or spatial measurement models were used to explore the relationship between influenza and air pollution, but these methods often ignore the temporal heterogeneity of air pollution on influenza.Geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is an effective spatial statistical model that accommodates the spatial non-stationarity of relationships between studied factors and their influencing factors by considering local heterogeneity in space14. Ibarra-Zapata E et al. used GWR model to explore the spatial non-stationarity of Influenza type A and its influencing factors in Mexico15. Although GWR provides a more precise and location-specific analysis of spatial patterns, it does not capture spatio-temporal synergies. Considering that the relationship between influenza and its influencing factors may have significant spatial and temporal variation, targeted research on the specific correlation between regional influenza cases and air pollution may provide a reference and countermeasures to judge the regional and seasonal changes in influenza, improve the capacity of atmospheric environmental governance and reduce the rapid spread of the influenza virus. Spatiotemporal geographically weighted regression (STWR) model, a spatiotemporal regression model, incorporates the heterogeneity in the relationship between variables16. In comparison to GWR and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) models, STWR model performs better in analyzing and explaining local spatiotemporal nonstationarity. This is achieved through clarifying the concept of "time distance" and introducing novel temporal kernel and spatiotemporal kernel functions based on this concept.Therefore, STWR model was utilized to examine the spatial and temporal variation relationship between influenza and air pollution.This study aims to conduct a descriptive analysis of the epidemiological characteristics of influenza cases in Fuzhou and construct OLS regression, GWR, and STWR models to investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of influenza at the county level in Fuzhou. Additionally, the impact of air pollution on influenza may vary over time. By determining the optimal regression model, we will comprehensively explain the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the impacts of different air pollutants on influenza incidence. The findings of this study will provide scientific evidence for the prevention and control strategies of influenza at the county-level in Fuzhou and support in response to future influenza outbreaks.MethodsStudy areaAs a coastal city in southeast China, the provincial capital city of Fujian Province, Fuzhou, consists of six districts, one county-level city and six counties12. The population in Fuzhou has increased from 7.12 million to 8.24 million in the past decade. The geographical location of Fuzhou is depicted in Fig. 1.Figure 1Location of Fuzhou City, China.Full size imageData sourceInfluenza case dataThe Chinese Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (CNIDRIS) was implemented in 2004 and covers all healthcare institutions throughout China. Since its implementation, legally reported infectious disease cases have been promptly reported within this system. Currently, the system includes a total of 40 infectious diseases. The data regarding influenza cases in Fuzhou from 2013 to 2019 were obtained from the CNIDRIS. We utilized solely anonymized aggregated data, which excluded sensitive information of cases, including names, valid identification numbers, work units, and contact numbers. In the final dataset, only essential information, such as gender, age, occupation, administrative region of residence, diagnosis date, and onset date, remained. The above data were classified and analyzed based on the administrative region of residence.Ethical considerationsThe ethical research board committee of Fuzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Approval No. IRB2020008) approved the research. The need for individual informed consents is waived by the institution/ review board due to the face that exclusively utilized anonymized aggregated data was used and did not involve any individual subjects. This study was carried out following the Helsinki Declaration contents.Air pollution dataThe monthly air pollution data for the period from January 2013 to December 2019 used in this study primarily originated from the China Air Quality Reanalysis Data Set (CAQRA). CAQRA was generated through a collaboration between the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IAP/CAS), the Chinese National Center for Environmental Monitoring (CNEMC), and other research institutions (https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00053). It provides a surface grid dataset for six air pollutant (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3) at a spatial resolution of 15 km.Statistical analysisDescriptive statistics were employed to illustrate the characteristics of the population distribution and temporal patterns of influenza. The incidence of influenza per 100,000 population in each year was calculated by dividing the influenza case counts by the population of that year. The time trend of the incidence of influenza was analyzed using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Histograms and line charts were utilized to show the temporal distribution of influenza. ArcGIS (version 10.5; ESRI) was used to depict the geographical distribution of influenza cases. Spearman's correlation coefficient was employed to evaluate the correlation between factors of air pollution and influenza case counts. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to examine collinearity among the selected air pollutants. Data management and statistical analysis were conducted using SPSS (version 26; IBM Corp) and R (version 4.2.1; The R Foundation).Regression analysisWe fit OLS regression, GWR, and STWR models to explore the potential spatiotemporal relationship between air pollution and influenza. The three models were fit by using the F-STWR 2.1.517. By comparing the performance of these models, we wanted to determine which one can more accurately predict and explain the impact of air pollution on influenza. Smoothed maps of Ordinary Kriging were employed in ArcGIS (version 10.5; ESRI) to illustrate the spatial pattern and impacts of various air pollutant on the influenza epidemic level. Furthermore, we employed the dynamic temporal regularity (DTW) and K-medoids algorithms to assess the county-level impacts and characteristics of air pollution on influenza. These algorithms were used to cluster the time series of county-level coefficients. Classifying the coefficients in different counties provides valuable insights into understanding the transmission and influencing factors of influenza in various geographical areas.Ordinary least squaresOrdinary least squares (OLS) regression model, a traditional linear regression model, is utilized to estimate the association between independent and dependent variables by minimizing the sum of squared residuals18. We employed the OLS regression model to investigate the global relationship between air pollutants and influenza case counts in Fuzhou. The model can be presented by Eq. (1).$$y={\beta }_{0}+\sum_{k=1}^{p}{\beta }_{k}{x}_{k}+\varepsilon$$ (1) where \(y\) is the influenza case counts, \({\beta }_{0}\) is the model’s intercept, \({x}_{k}\) corresponds to the \(k\)th air pollutants variable of the model (\(k\)= 1 to \(p\)), and \(\varepsilon\) is the random error. Being a global model, OLS regression assumes a uniform relationship between independent and dependent variables across the entire study area. Consequently, it does not consider the analysis of localized regional characteristics.Geographically weighted regressionGeographically weighted regression (GWR) model builds upon OLS regression model by incorporating the spatial location of the data, allowing the regression coefficients to vary based on geographical location19. In this study, we employed the GWR model to investigate the local spatial relationship between air pollutants and influenza case counts in Fuzhou. In Eq. (2), the sample's position (u, v) is introduced into the regression equation to estimate local parameters. The model accounts for the spatial heterogeneity that exists between the independent and dependent variables.$${y}_{i}={\beta }_{0}\left({u}_{i},{v}_{i}\right)+\sum_{k=1}^{p}{\beta }_{k}{\left({u}_{i},{v}_{i}\right)x}_{ik}+{\varepsilon }_{i}$$ (2) where \({y}_{i}\) is the influenza case counts for location \(i\), \({u}_{i}\) and \({v}_{i}\) are the coordinates of location \(i\), \({\beta }_{0}\left({u}_{i},{v}_{i}\right)\) is the intercept at location \(i\), \({\beta }_{k}\left({u}_{i},{v}_{i}\right)\) is the local parameter estimate for air pollutants variable \({x}_{ik}\) at location \(i\), and \({\varepsilon }_{i}\) is the error term.For predicting the regression coefficients of GWR model, the distance-decay function (\({w}_{ij}\)) is employed as a weighted factor that considers the distance between the modeled positions and the observed values. When the distribution of sampling points is irregular, an adaptive weight function is used to adjust the bandwidth based on the density of the spatial points, as depicted in Eq. (3).$$w_{ij} = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\left[ {1 - \left( {d_{ij} /b} \right)^{2} } \right]^{2} } & {d_{ij} \le b} \\ 0 & {d_{ij} > b} \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ (3) where \({d}_{ij}\) is the distance between observation \(i\) and \(j\), \(b\) is the adaptive bandwidth. For a case in which the distance between observations is greater than the adaptive bandwidth, the distance-decay function becomes zero. GWR model utilizes neighboring points surrounding each observation point as weights, thus reflecting the varying degrees of influence from different geographical locations. Consequently, GWR model can more accurately capture and account the spatial heterogeneity in the influenza case counts across different regions in Fuzhou.Ethics approval and consentThe ethical research board committee of Fuzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Approval No. IRB2020008) approved the research. The need for individual informed consents is waived by the institution/ review board due to the face that exclusively utilized anonymized aggregated data was used and did not involve any individual subjects.Spatiotemporal weighted regressionSpatiotemporal weighted regression (STWR) proposes a new numerical time-varying decay weighting strategy and adopts a new spatiotemporal kernel for analysing processes that contain both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. In STWR, the time distance is the rate of change of the attribute value within a time interval, rather than the time interval itself20. STWR is the comprehensive time-varying numerical difference rate information in the time interval on the basis of GWR. Its basic calculation framework is consistent with that of GWR21. We utilized the STWR model to explore the local spatiotemporal relationship between air pollutants and influenza case counts in Fuzhou. The model can be expressed as:$${y}_{i}^{t}={\beta }_{0}^{t}\left({u}_{i},{v}_{i}\right)+{\sum }_{k}{\beta }_{k}^{t}({u}_{i},{v}_{i}){x}_{ik}^{t}+{\varepsilon }_{i}^{t}$$ (4) In Eq. (4), \({{\text{y}}}_{i}^{t}\) represents the influenza case counts of the \(t\) period, the ith regression point regression point \(({u}_{i},{v}_{i})\), \({\varepsilon }_{i}^{t}\) is the random error term that satisfies air pollutants and identical distribution, and \({\beta }_{0}^{t}\left({u}_{i},{v}_{i}\right)\) and \({\beta }_{k}^{t}({u}_{i},{v}_{i})\) represent the constant term and coefficient of the \(t\) period and the ith regression point \(({u}_{i},{v}_{i})\), respectively15. The calculation formula is:$${\widehat{\beta }}^{t}\left({u}_{i},{v}_{i}\right)={[{(X}_{{S}_{\Delta t}}^{T}{W}_{\Delta t}\left({u}_{i},{v}_{i}\right){X}_{{S}_{\Delta t}})}^{-1}{X}_{{S}_{\Delta t}}{W}_{\Delta t}({u}_{i},{v}_{i})]{y}_{{S}_{\Delta t}}^{T}$$ (5) In Eq. (5), \({X}_{{S}_{\Delta t}}\) is the ground matrix of local air pollutants observed in the time interval \(\Delta t\), and \({W}_{\Delta t}\left({u}_{i},{v}_{i}\right)\) are the space–time weight matrices of observed values in different positions and time periods. Its subelement \({W}_{ij}\) represents the influence of the \(j\) observation point on the \(i\) regression point, which can be calculated according to the kernel function according to the distance.The time interval decay weight assignment strategies of Gaussian, bisquare and GTWR are usually different. STWR uses a time assignment function based on the numerical difference rate between the regression point and the observation point22. The weighted average form of the spatiotemporal kernel in STWR is given by Eq. (6).$$W_{ij\Delta t}^{t} = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\left[ {\frac{2}{{1 + exp\left( { - \frac{{\left| {\left( {y_{i\left( t \right)} - y_{{j\left( {t - q} \right)}} } \right)/y_{{j\left( {t - q} \right)}} } \right|}}{{\Delta t/b_{T} }}} \right)}} - 1} \right],} & {if\; 0 < \Delta t < b_{T} } \\ {0,} & {otherwise} \\ \end{array} } \right.$$ (6) In Eq. (6), \({y}_{i\left(t\right)}-{y}_{j\left(t-q\right)}\) represents the numerical difference between the regression point in \(i\) and \(j\) in \(t-q\) within time interval \(\Delta t\); \({b}_{T}\) is the time bandwidth. This assignment function can more effectively capture the different time influence weights of the historical observation point on the regression point.Comparison of OLS regression, GWR and STWR modelsThe average R-squared (R2) is an indicator used to measure the degree of fitness of a regression model to observed data, representing the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the model. The residual sum of squares (RSS) is a metric that measures the fitting error of the model, indicating the degree of difference between the predicted values and the actual observed values. The corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) is an indicator of the relative information loss in the model estimation process, taking into account the model's goodness of fit and the number of parameters. Therefore, a better-performing model has a higher R2 value and lower RSS and AICc values. By comparing R2, RSS, and AICc, we can evaluate and compare the performance of OLS regression, GWR, and STWR models.Dynamic time warping and K-medoids algorithmDynamic time warping (DTW) constructs the correspondence of two sequence elements of different lengths according to the principle of proximity and evaluates the similarity of two sequences23. It is widely applied in the assessment of time-series similarity. Meanwhile, it is also considered to be the most accurate method to evaluate the similarity of time-series data24. The calculation method of DTW is given by Eq. (7).$$DTW=\left|{x}_{i}-{y}_{j}\right|+min\left\{D\left(i-1,j\right),D\left(i,j-1\right),D\left(i-1,j-1\right)\right\}$$ (7) where \({x}_{i}\) and \({y}_{j}\) represent the values of each graph and D represents the distance between two points. Through \(\left|{x}_{i}-{y}_{j}\right|\), the difference between the two sequences is first measured, and then the minimum number in the previous values is added.The DTW algorithm is usually used in conjunction with the K-medoids algorithm, which is a partitioning-based clustering algorithm25. The K-medoids algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning technique that is able to effectively partition the observations in the dataset into different clusters with a centre for each cluster26. The K-medoids algorithm steps are performed in the following order: (1) randomly select K samples as centres, (2) calculate the distance of all samples to randomly selected K centres, (3) assign the samples to the nearest centre, (4) mark them as a group, (5) calculate the total distance and so-called total cost, and (6) repeat these steps until the lowest total cost is obtained.Research workflowFigure 2 shows the research workflow in this study. First, we collected the monthly influenza case counts in Fuzhou from 2013 to 2019 and described the epidemiological characteristics. Second, Spearman's correlation analysis and collinearity diagnosis were used to screen the ultimate air pollutants. Both the screened variables and the dependent variable were then normalized. Third, OLS regression, GWR and STWR models were constructed. Fourth, the spatial coefficient of variation surface generated by STWR model was used to explore and analyse the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of various air pollutant on the influenza epidemic level. Spatiotemporal heterogeneity refers to the variation or differences in the distribution and occurrence of a phenomenon (in this study, influenza case counts) across both space and time. Finally, the DTW and K-medoids algorithms were applied to cluster the county-level time-series coefficients.Figure 2Research workflow.Full size imageResultsEpidemiological characteristicsThere were 11,524 influenza cases reported in Fuzhou between 2013 and 2019, with an average annual incidence of 20.54 cases per 100,000 people, including 6,518 male cases and 5,006 female cases. The under 14 years old group accounted for 68.74% of all the reported cases and had the highest incidence rate of 559.43 cases per 100,000 people. Among all occupational groups, Scattered children accounted for the largest proportion (37.50%) of cases, followed by others (27.87%) and students (23.72%). The demographic characteristics of influenza cases in Fuzhou from 2013 to 2019 are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Demographic characteristics of influenza cases in Fuzhou, China 2013–2019.Full size tableDuring the 7-year study period, there was an ascending long-term trend (Z = 45.055, P < 0.001) in the incidence of influenza in Fuzhou, and the highest annual incidence rate was in 2019 (48.36 cases per 100,000 people). Meanwhile, there was significant seasonal variation in the monthly distribution of influenza cases in Fuzhou, with two significant peaks from April to July and from November to February (Fig. 3). Moreover, the number of cases during the second peak (59.97%) was usually greater than that during the first peak (23.3%).Figure 3Monthly incidence and reported cases of influenza in Fuzhou, China 2013–2019.Full size imageFigure 4 demonstrates the incidence of influenza in each district and county in Fuzhou from 2013 to 2019. In the past seven years, influenza cases have been reported in all the 13 areas of Fuzhou. In general, the incidence of influenza in central Fuzhou was generally higher than that in the surrounding areas during 2013–2015. Since 2016, the high incidence of influenza in Fuzhou has extended from the central region to the surrounding areas, among which Minqing County and Mawei District became the main areas with a high incidence of influenza (Fig. 4).Figure 4Geographic distribution of influenza incidence in Fuzhou, China 2013–2019.Full size imageSpearman's correlation analysis and collinearity diagnosticsAs shown in Table 2, all air pollutants were significantly related to influenza case counts. There is a negative correlation between O3 and influenza case count (Spearman's correlation coefficient < 0), while the other air pollutant show a positive correlation with influenza case count (Spearman's correlation coefficient > 0). The correlations between NO2 and influenza were significantly higher compared to other air pollutant, with a maximum value of 0.499.Table 2 Spearman's correlation results between influenza case counts and air pollutant in Fuzhou, China 2013–2019.Full size tableSince all the absolute values of Spearman's correlation coefficients were below 0.6, a subsequent multicollinearity test was performed for the six air pollutant. PM2.5 was removed, ensuring that the VIFs of the remaining air pollutant remained below 10 (Table 3).Table 3 Colinearity diagnostics of air pollutant in Fuzhou, China 2013–2019.Full size tableAnalysis of spatiotemporal heterogeneity of influenza and air pollutantComparison of model performancesWe compared the performance of the STWR model with OLS regression and GWR models (Table 4). In comparison to the results of OLS regression and GWR models, STWR model showed the highest R2, indicating a better fit. Additionally, STWR model exhibited the lowest RSS value among the three models, suggesting a superior fit. Similar conclusions were drawn for the AICc value. Overall, STWR model emerges as a more favorable choice for the scope of this study.Table 4 Performance comparison of OLS regression, GWR and STWR models.Full size tableFurther comparisons were made for the monthly R2 and RSS values. Compared to OLS regression and GWR models, STWR model consistently maintained the highest R2 and lowest RSS across the entire study period (Fig. 5). This further highlights the superior fitting performance of STWR model in this study.Figure 5(a) R-squared values of the models and (b) the residual sum of squares values of the models from 2013 to 2019.Full size imageThe fit of STWR model is affected by the influenza case counts. The three largest differences in R2 values between STWR and GWR models were observed in September 2014, May 2015, and January 2019 (Fig. 6). These time points generally corresponded to influenza peak seasons and periods of increased influenza activity throughout the study period. The superior fitting performance of the STWR model becomes more pronounced in the presence of rapid changes in the influenza case counts.Figure 6Comparison of R2 difference of GWR and STWR models with the influenza case counts.Full size imageInfluenza epidemic level variation of spatial coefficient corresponding to different air pollutantTo explore the spatial distribution of the impacts of different air pollutant on the influenza epidemic level variation in Fuzhou, one year was divided into the influenza high season (e.g., top 6 ranking for influenza case counts) and influenza low season (e.g., bottom 6 ranking for influenza case counts) according to the actual influenza epidemiological data in Fuzhou. Figure 7 showed that the negative impact of CO on the western regional influenza epidemic gradually became positive over time during the peak influenza season. This means that the higher the CO concentration is, the greater the epidemic intensity of influenza. In the influenza low season, the impact of CO on the northwest region gradually changed from positive to negative. This means that the higher the CO concentration is, the lower the epidemic intensity of influenza (Fig. 7 and Figure S1).Figure 7Spatial variation coefficient surface of the impact of CO on influenza in Fuzhou.Full size imageThe impact of NO2 on the influenza epidemic was always the opposite in the eastern and western regions of Fuzhou (Fig. 8 and Figure S2). In the influenza high season, the positive impact of NO2 on the influenza epidemic in the western region of Fuzhou gradually changed from 2013 to a negative impact in 2017 and eventually returned to a positive impact in 2019. The eastern region experienced the opposite impact. In the low influenza season, NO2 had a positive impact on the influenza epidemic in the western region of Fuzhou but showed a negative impact in 2017.Figure 8Spatial variation coefficient surface of the impact of NO2 on influenza in Fuzhou.Full size imageConsistent with CO, the influence coefficient of O3 on the influenza epidemic changed from negative to positive in the western region and from positive to negative in the eastern region during the influenza high season (Fig. 9 and Figure S3). In the influenza low season of 2015, O3 showed a strong negative impact near Taijiang District, and high concentrations of O3 could reduce the intensity of influenza.Figure 9Spatial variation coefficient surface of the impact of O3 on influenza in Fuzhou.Full size imageCompared with NO2, the influence coefficient of PM10 on the influenza epidemic was also always opposite in the eastern and western regions of Fuzhou (Fig. 10 and Figure S4). The impact coefficient changed from positive and negative to positive during the influenza high season in the western region of Fuzhou. In the influenza low season, the opposite impact was observed, i.e., from positive to negative to positive again.Figure 10Spatial variation coefficient surface of the impact of PM10 on influenza in Fuzhou.Full size imageAs shown in Fig. 11 and Figure S5, the impact coefficient of SO2 on the influenza epidemic was basically consistent in all areas of Fuzhou in 2017 and the low influenza season in 2013 and 2019. In the influenza high season of 2015, SO2 had a positive impact on the influenza epidemic near Minqing County, and the high concentration of SO2 may have increased the intensity of the influenza epidemic. In contrast, during the influenza low season, SO2 had a negative impact near Yongtai County.Figure 11Spatial variation coefficient surface of the impact of SO2 on influenza in Fuzhou.Full size imageCluster the county-level time-series coefficientsWe used the DTW algorithm to assess the similarity of county-level time-series coefficients to further investigate the coefficient surfaces of geospatial processes. The K-medoids algorithm was then used to cluster the districts and counties according to similarity. The optimal "K" was determined to be 4 by using the elbow method. Finally, the time-series coefficients of the four cluster centres can be aggregated monthly to form a heatmap.The time-series results of the impact of CO on the influenza epidemic were clustered (Fig. 12a), Jin'an District, Gulou District and Taijiang District formed a group (Cluster 3), and CO had a positive impact on the influenza epidemic from January to September (Fig. 12b). The higher the CO concentration is, the greater the intensity of the influenza epidemic. Minqing County, Yongtai County, Fuqing City and Luoyuan County were grouped into Cluster 4. The CO in this region had a greater positive impact on influenza epidemics during most of the period (Fig. 12c).Figure 12Time series clustering results of the coefficients of CO, NO2, O3, PM10, and SO2 on influenza. (a, d, g, j, m) show the spatial distribution of county-level clustering results for CO, NO2, O3, PM10, and SO2, respectively. (b, c) are the time series plots and heat plots of CO coefficients in the centre of Cluster 3 and Cluster 4, respectively. (e, f) are the time series plots and heat plots of NO2 coefficients in the centre of Cluster 3 and Cluster 4, respectively. (h, i) are the time series plots and heat plots of O3 coefficients in the centre of Cluster 1 and Cluster 4, respectively. (k, l) are the time series plots and heat plots of PM10 coefficients in the centre of Cluster 3 and Cluster 4, respectively. (n, o) are the time series plots and heat plots of SO2 coefficients in the centre of Cluster 3 and Cluster 4, respectively.Full size imageThe clustering results of NO2 showed that Cluster 2 was composed of Cangshan District, Mawei District, Yongtai County and Lianjiang County (Fig. 12d). The concentration of NO2 increased in the summer and fall, which may increase the intensity of the influenza epidemic. In particular, NO2 in May and November was also higher than that in other months, with average influence coefficients of 0.3988 and 0.4010, respectively. However, the NO2 in Cluster 2 had a significant negative impact on the influenza epidemic in January 2019 (Fig. 12e). In addition, the areas around Fuzhou City, such as Minqing County, Luoyuan County and Changle District, formed Cluster 4. It had obvious positive impacts in winter (Fig. 12f). The mean coefficients of variation in December and January were 0.0918 and 0.0428, respectively.O3 aggravated the intensity of influenza epidemics in some areas (Fig. 12h), such as in Cangshan District, Minhou County and Mawei District (Cluster 1) (Fig. 12g). Simultaneously, it also showed a relatively small positive impact on Cluster 4, i.e., Minqing County, Yongtai County, Fuqing City and Luoyuan County (Fig. 12i). The clustering results were identical for PM10 and SO2 (Fig. 12j, m). Cluster 3 included Jin'an District, Gulou District and Taijiang District, with PM10 and SO2 generally having positive impacts on the influenza epidemic (Fig. 12k, n). For Cluster 4, which was composed of the surrounding areas of Fuzhou, PM10 had a negative impact on the influenza epidemic, while SO2 showed a positive impact on the influenza epidemic (Fig. 12l, o).DiscussionEpidemiological characteristics of influenzaSince 2013, the epidemic of influenza in Fuzhou has shown an obvious trend of high incidence in winter and spring, which is similar to the monitoring situation in Hangzhou and Guangzhou in China27. The incidence of influenza in Fuzhou is increasing yearly, especially in 2019, a seasonal H3N2 influenza outbreak28, indicating that the prevention and control of influenza in Fuzhou is still in a severe situation. Influenza has become one of the key infectious diseases for prevention and control in Fuzhou. Every outbreak of influenza has caused great economic loss to the Fuzhou area and poses a serious threat to people's health. The central urban area of Fuzhou is a region with a high incidence of influenza, mainly because of the dense population in the central urban area, with a large migrant population, poor living conditions and high living density, and poor awareness of disease prevention. Scattered children are the main group affected by influenza. This phenomenon may be related to the living environment and behavioral habits of scattered children. Scattered children usually reside in different areas and have more contact with people, making them more susceptible to potential influenza viruses. In addition, scattered children may be more likely to spread the virus in schools or social settings because they have more frequent contact with other children.Comparison of the fitting impacts of OLS regression, GWR, and STWR modelsOLS regression model is a global regression model that assumes a fixed relationship between variables29. GWR model is a local regression model that considers the spatial non-stationarity of the relationship between variables30. STWR model is a spatiotemporal regression model that considers the temporal heterogeneity of the relationship between variables. STWR model utilizes different regression coefficients at various spatiotemporal points to better explain the changing relationship between variables under different temporal and spatial conditions20. Therefore, STWR model can make more full use of the critical time-varying information of history to improve model performance, which provides more accurate prediction model and analytical statistical method for spatiotemporal epidemiological studies of infectious diseases such as influenza.We explored the relationship between the influenza case counts and major air pollution from 2013 to 2019 through OLS regression, GWR and STWR models. Through comparing R2, RSS, and AICc, we found that STWR model had the best goodness of fit compared with OLS regression and GWR (Table 4, Figs. 5, 6). Meanwhile, the STWR model fitting results also had a significant advantage when the influenza case counts changed rapidly.Spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the impacts of air pollution on influenzaIn recent years, air pollution has become an important public health problem worldwide, and extensive epidemiological and clinical evidence shows that short-term and long-term exposure to air pollutant will increase the incidence risk and mortality of many systemic diseases, such as cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases31,32. Karen et al. examined the impact of air pollution on the total population and infant mortality in the United States during the 1918 influenza pandemic33. The study found that the severity of air pollution is related to the urban coal-fired power generation capacity. The study results found that air pollution exacerbated the pandemic. Compared with low coal cities, high coal city infant mortality increased by 11%, medium coal city increased by 8%, and whole population mortality increased by 10% and 5%. Results from Australia showed that increasing PM10 and O3 concentrations will increase paediatric influenza cases, with impact RR values of 1.11 (1.10–1.13) and 1.28 (1.25–1.31), respectively34. Santus et al. studied the association between atmospheric pollutants and respiratory diseases and found that every 1 mg/m3 increase in CO increased the number of emergency cases of upper respiratory tract infection between 0–5 d35.In our study, we conducted a spatiotemporal regression analysis using STWR model to explore the relationship between air pollution and influenza. By incorporating the geographic location and temporal information of county-level region in Fuzhou, our analysis reflected for the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the impacts of air pollution on influenza. The results demonstrate significant variations in the impact of air pollution on the influenza epidemic level between county-level areas and different time (Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).We also found that the same air pollution in the same influenza pandemic period may have two completely opposite impacts in different regions. For example, the impacts of PM10 and NO2 on influenza epidemics were always opposite in the eastern and western regions of Fuzhou (Figs. 8, 10). SO2 occasionally exhibited similar results as well. The eastern and western regions of Fuzhou may have different sources of pollution, leading to variations in the composition and characteristics of PM10, NO2 and SO2. These differences can result in varying impacts on the influenza epidemic in each region. The meteorological conditions, such as wind patterns and atmospheric stability, can differ between the eastern and western regions of Fuzhou. These conditions can influence the dispersion and accumulation of PM10, NO2 and SO2, thereby affecting their impact on the influenza epidemic. The eastern and western regions of Fuzhou may have different population densities and behavioral patterns, which can influence the exposure and susceptibility to PM10, NO2 and SO2. These variations in exposure and susceptibility can contribute to the opposite impacts on the influenza epidemic. It is important to note that these are potential reasons for the observed opposite impacts, and further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.Moreover, the direction of the impact of the same air pollutant on influenza epidemics continuously changed over time. For instance, the influence coefficients of O3 and CO on the influenza epidemic changed from negative to positive in the western region during the influenza high season (Figs. 7, 9). The concentrations of O3 and CO may vary over different time periods. In the early stages of the influenza high season, the concentrations of O3 and CO may be relatively low, resulting in a negative impact on the influenza epidemic. However, as time progresses, the concentrations of O3 and CO may gradually increase, thereby changing their impact on the influenza epidemic and eventually becoming positive. In addition to changes in O3 and CO concentrations, other environmental factors may also affect their impact on the influenza epidemic. For example, factors such as temperature and humidity may vary over time, thereby altering the impacts of O3 and CO on the influenza epidemic. However, further investigation is needed to determine the specific mechanism.Finally, we also found that in some areas, the relationship between air pollution and influenza epidemics may change over time. Cluster 4 (Fig. 12o) was composed of the surrounding areas of Fuzhou, such as Minqing County, Fuqing City and Changle District and other districts and counties, and the impact coefficient changed from negative to positive in 2018. This suggests that local spatial heterogeneity is not static in time but may be dynamic.By utilizing STWR model, we have identified the complex relationship between air pollution factors and influenza in Fuzhou. The impacts of air pollution on influenza may be dynamic and could vary in different regions and time periods. The research findings emphasize the importance of considering spatiotemporal heterogeneity when studying the relationship between air pollution and influenza. It holds significant value for the development of more effective strategies for preventing and controlling influenza.Limitations and future workHowever, our current work still has some limitations: (1) The study utilized retrospective observational data, which limits the ability to investigate the direct impact of air pollution on influenza, as well as the ability to obtain specific exposure information from the population regarding air pollution, such as exposure duration. (2) In order to have a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the influenza outbreak in Fuzhou, it is also necessary to consider meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, and diurnal variations, as well as the economic development level of the region36. (3) The current STWR model cannot support multiple scales, which will reduce the reliability of the analysis to a certain extent. (4) The data source used in this study is an infectious diseases reporting information system, which indicates that we can only count information on influenza patients who visit hospitals. 68.74% of the reported cases were pediatric patients under 14 years of age, suggesting that adult influenza patients may have been lost because they did not seek medical care. And the management level at different hospitals may affect the reporting of infectious diseases. (5) We only used data from 2013 to 2019 to exclude the possibility that the outbreak of COVID-19 may have introduced new confounding factors in the studies of influenza.In future work, it is important to consider the impacts of other factors such as meteorological conditions, economic development levels, and human activities on influenza. Additionally, further investigation can be conducted to determine whether the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the relationship between air pollution and influenza has changed following the outbreak of COVID-19.ConclusionsThis study investigated the epidemiological characteristics of influenza in Fuzhou and analyzed the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the impacts of air pollution on influenza. The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) In Fuzhou, the epidemic of influenza shows a clear trend of high incidence in winter and spring, and the incidence rate has been increasing over the years. The central districts of Fuzhou have a higher incidence rate of influenza. (2) There is a correlation between air pollution and influenza in different county-level regions of Fuzhou. (3) The STWR model outperforms the OLS regression and GWR models and is the optimal regression model. The STWR model, used to study the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the impacts of air pollution on influenza, helps to understand and identify key air pollutants during different periods of influenza outbreaks. By understanding its spatiotemporal heterogeneity, targeted and effective prevention and control strategies can be developed, providing a scientific basis for the precise management of influenza outbreaks.In a word, our study provides valuable insights into the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the impact of air pollution on influenza. STWR model could be a useful method for exploring the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the impacts of air pollution on influenza in geospatial processes.

Newsroom Bird Flu Blog MDA Blog Pending Regulations for Public Comments Press Releases MDA Public Meetings Calendar Preliminary Testing Confirms Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in a Charles County Backyard Flock February 21, 2024 ANNAPOLIS, MD (February 21, 2024)— State laboratory testing has detected a case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) in a Charles County backyard flock. State Department of Agriculture officials have quarantined all affected premises, and birds on the properties are being or have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from affected flocks will not enter the food system. Confirmation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory is pending with final results anticipated in the coming days. “The latest non-negative result should serve as a reminder for all poultry growers, operators, and backyard flock owners to remain vigilant when it comes to the threat of HPAI, especially as the spring migratory season begins,” said Maryland Department of Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks. “Regardless of flock size, biosecurity remains the most effective way to prevent the spread of this disease among poultry.” Avian influenza is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. This virus affects chickens, ducks, and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and raptors. According to the Maryland Department of Health, the risk of transmission between birds and the general public is low. The Maryland Department of Agriculture recommends the following common-sense biosecurity steps if HPAI is suspected on personal property, wild birds, or in a commercial operation. Look for signs of illness. Know the warning signs of infectious bird diseases. Report suspected sick birds: To report a possible case of HPAI call the Maryland Department of Agriculture at 410-841-5810. Commercial chicken growers and backyard flock owners can email questions about the outbreak to MD.Birdflu@maryland.gov. Key biosecurity practices: Clean and disinfect transportation. Don’t walk through or drive trucks, tractors, or equipment in areas where waterfowl or other wildlife feces may be. If you can’t avoid this, clean your shoes, vehicle, and equipment thoroughly to prevent bringing disease agents back to your flock. This is especially important when visiting with farmers or those who hunt wild fowl such as when gathering at a local coffee shop, restaurant, or gas station. Remove loose feed. Don’t give wild birds, rodents, and insects a free lunch. Remove spilled or uneaten feed right away, and make sure feed storage units are secure and free of holes. Wild birds can carry HPAI. Keep visitors to a minimum. Only allow those people who take care of your poultry to come in contact with your birds, including family and friends. Make sure everyone who has contact with your flock follows biosecurity principles. Wash your hands before and after coming in contact with live poultry. Wash with soap and water. If using a hand sanitizer, first remove manure, feathers, and other materials from your hands because disinfectants will not penetrate organic matter or caked-on dirt. Provide disposable boot covers (preferred) and/or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock. If using a footbath, be sure to remove all droppings, mud or debris from boots and shoes using a long-handled scrub brush BEFORE stepping into the disinfectant footbath, and always keep it clean. Change clothes before entering poultry areas and before exiting the property. Visitors should wear protective outer garments or disposable coveralls, boots, and headgear when handling birds, and shower and/or change clothes when leaving the facility. Clean and disinfect tools or equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. Before allowing vehicles, trucks, tractors, or tools and equipment—including egg flats and cases that have come in contact with birds or their droppings—to exit the property, make sure they are cleaned and disinfected to prevent contaminated equipment from transporting disease. Do not move or reuse items that cannot be cleaned and disinfected—such as cardboard egg flats.

Pictured: GSK building in Dresden, Germany/iStock, 13threephotography Vir Biotechnology and GSK are ending a part of their collaborative effort to develop a flu treatment, the San Francisco-based biotech announced in its earnings results reported Thursday. According to Vir’s announcement, GSK terminated the collaboration to research, develop and commercialize the biotech’s monoclonal antibodies for the prevention, treatment, or prophylaxis of the influenza virus. The agreement was made in May 2021, but with the termination Vir will hold on to the sole rights to advance investigational therapies for flu on its own or with other partners. On Thursday’s investor call, Vir CEO Marianne De Backer said that the biotech would retain the “sole rights” to its flu therapies and will look to go after “external partnerships” for the treatment. The collaboration on the flu treatment hit a significant bump in the road in July 2023 when the topline data from a Phase II study showed the flu shot, known as VIR-2482, had not reached the primary and secondary endpoints. Patients given the higher dose of 1,200mg saw a 16% drop in influenza A-like illness compared with a placebo, which was not statistically significant. Vir CMO Phil Pang said at the time that the results were “disappointing” but that the company would need to conduct more analysis to understand the results. The complete data analysis will be in a scientific publication in the second quarter. GSK and Vir are still collaborating with both companies “actively pursuing external partnership opportunities” for antibody-drug conjugates and “next-generation” influenza A and B antibodies. The companies previously inked an agreement to research and develop therapies for treating coronaviruses, but eventually stepped back from the deal last year. In 2021, GSK boosted its equity investment by $120 million and made a $225 million upfront payment to collaborate on research and development for influenza. The VIR-2482 candidate is a monoclonal antibody, which completed Phase I when the GSK partnership began. Vir is not the only biotech currently targeting influenza. Moderna has several vaccine candidates and its mRNA-1010 vaccine candidate last year showed some effect in influenza A and less so in influenza B. Pfizer is in the midst of a Phase III influenza vaccine trial, which was started in 2022. Tyler Patchen is a staff writer at BioSpace. You can reach him at tyler.patchen@biospace.com.

The observational study is based on insurance records of 800,000 US children ages 2 to 5 years old who received flu vaccines from 2011 to 2018. Researchers analyzed rates of diagnosed influenza among children by birth month, and found that those with October birthdays had the lowest rates. US children typically visit pediatricians around their birthday each year for well-check visits and routine vaccinations, and children who visit in October were likely offered the seasonal flu shot as it was available. The seasonal shot would not likely be ready for children with spring and summer birthdays, the authors said. October flu vaccinations were greater in children with October births compared with other birth months, with 48.9% of children born in October were vaccinated in October, compared with 34.0% of children born in August, 40.2% of those born in September, 27.3% of those born in November, and 33.7% of those born in December. October may be best month to get flu shot The authors found that 2.7% of children born and vaccinated in October were diagnosed as having flu that season. The percentage rose to 3.0% of those born and vaccinated in August or January, 2.9% of those born and vaccinated in September or December, and 2.8% of those born and vaccinated in November. This suggests October maybe the optimal time to be vaccinated against the flu. "Under the assumption that children born in October are otherwise similar to children born in other months, our findings suggest that the specific timing of influenza vaccination among children born in October may lead to lower rates of influenza infection," the authors concluded. In a Harvard Medical School press release on the findings, senior study author Anupam Jena, MD, PhD, said, "There are a lot of variables when it comes to the timing and severity of flu season or a person’s risk of getting sick, and many of those are out of our control. One thing we have some control over is the timing of the shot, and it looks like October is indeed the best month for kids to get vaccinated against the flu." Indiana reports first measles case in 5 years News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Measles The Indiana Department of Health (IDH) today announced that a measles infection has been confirmed in a Lake County resident, marking the state’s first case in 5 years. Dave Haygarth / Flickr cc In a statement, it said it wouldn't add any other details about the case to protect patient privacy, and that the risk to the public is low. State and local officials continue to investigate the case. Lake County is in northwestern Indiana and is considered part of the Chicago metropolitan area.State health commissioner Lindsay Weaver, MD, said 90% of unvaccinated people who are exposed to measles will become sick. "This case is a good reminder that you are at risk if you haven’t been vaccinated," she said.This case is a good reminder that you are at risk if you haven’t been vaccinated.The IDH also shared details about three measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine clinics next week, offering free vaccine for people older than 1 year old who would like to be vaccinated.Minnesota reports third measles caseElsewhere, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) added one more measles case to its total for 2024, bringing the total to three.The state's two earlier cases are siblings who live in the Twin Cities metro area, CBS Minnesota reported, citing state health officials. One of the Minnesota cases is recorded as imported, and the other two cases are related. Officials have said that the risk to the public is extremely low.US total rises to 35 cases in 14 states and NYCIn related developments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today updated its measles total for 2024 today, adding 15 more cases since February 15 and bringing the total to 35.In late January, the CDC urged providers to be alert for measles cases given a steady rise in global cases against the backdrop of gaps in vaccine coverage. WHO advisers recommend strain picks for next Northern Hemisphere flu vaccines News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Influenza Vaccines The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced the flu vaccine strain recommendations from its advisory group for the Northern Hemisphere 2024-25 flu season, which are the same as the group recommended for the Southern Hemisphere's 2024 season. CDC/ Dr. F. A. Murphy As for its recommendation for the Southern Hemisphere seasonal flu vaccines in September, the WHO experts recommends that companies switch back to trivalent (three-strain) vaccines and leave out the influenza B Yamagata lineage component. Yamagata B lineage not detected since 2020 In accompanying background information, the WHO said no naturally occurring influenza B Yamagata lineage viruses have been confirmed since March 2020 and that the vaccine strain isn't needed anymore. The recommendations for egg-based and cell-based vaccine strains vary, and the latest picks for both versions of the Northern Hemisphere vaccines are the same those recommended for the Southern Hemisphere. For countries that still use quadrivalent (four-strain) versions of the vaccine containing a second B strain, the WHO recommends a strain similar to the Yamagata Phuket/3073/2013 lineage virus, the same as other recent picks. Advisers pick 2 new pandemic preparedness vaccine viruses During their twice-a-year meetings to recommend strains to include in seasonal flu vaccines, the WHO's advisory group also examines the latest developments with zoonotic flu strains to see if any new viruses are different enough from earlier strains to warrant new candidate vaccine strains for pandemic preparedness. At its meeting, the group proposed two new candidate strains, both targeting recent variant H1N1 viruses. One is antigenically similar to A/Catalonia/NSAV198289092/2023, and the other is similar to A/England/234600203/2023. Analysis finds flu vaccine protection wanes 9% per month in adults News brief Jim Wappes Topics Influenza Vaccines CDC / Jim Gathany Data across nine pre-COVID flu seasons in Ontario reveal that flu vaccine effectiveness (VE) wanes 9% every 28 days beginning 41 days post-vaccination in adults but not in children, according to a study yesterday in Eurosurveillance. The researchers, a group called the Canadian Immunization Research Network (CIRN) Provincial Collaborative Network (PCN) Investigators, analyzed data from lab and health administration databases in the province from the 2010-11 through the 2018-19 flu seasons. Participants were Ontarians 6 months and older living in the community who received a flu vaccine before being tested for influenza using polymerase chain reaction tests. Of 53,065 people who were vaccinated before testing, 10,264 (19%) tested positive for flu. The investigators determined that the odds of contracting influenza increased from 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.22) at 42 to 69 days after vaccination, and peaked at 1.27 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.55) at 126 to 153 days compared with the reference interval, which was 14 to 41 days after vaccination. This corresponds to a 5% to 27% drop in VE compared with shortly after vaccination. No waning protection found in kids The researchers also determined that VE dropped 9% every 28 days—or a 1.09-times increased risk of influenza every 28 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.15). They did not, however, observe any VE waning in children. Adults 18 to 64 years showed the greatest decline in protection against the H1N1 strain (aOR per 28 days, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.64). For people 65 years and older, it was against the H3N2 strain (aOR per 28 days, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.33). Annual influenza vaccination programmes need to strike the balance between vaccinating the population too early versus too late. The authors conclude, "Annual influenza vaccination programmes need to strike the balance between vaccinating the population too early versus too late, while taking into account system vaccination capacity and year-to-year variability of influenza season timing." They add, "Certain age groups may experience more pronounced waning of the protection against specific influenza types/subtypes." Chronic wasting disease confirmed in another Arkansas county News brief Jim Wappes Topics Chronic Wasting Disease Colby Stopa / Flickr cc The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC) yesterday confirmed that a hunter-harvested white-tailed deer in Craighead County tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), an always-fatal prion disease. The 2-year-old doe was harvested near Jonesboro during the Arkansas firearm season late last year. A sample from the doe tested positive for CWD, and the finding was confirmed by the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Madison. Craighead County is in northeastern Arkansas, abutting Missouri and not far from the Tennessee border. Expanded CWD management zone The AGFC noted that, in addition to Craighead County, three new counties—Sharp, Cleburne, and Mississippi—have been added to the CWD management zone owing to their proximity to other newly identified CWD positive cases. "This proactive measure of including counties based on risk values is outlined in the state's CWD Management and Response Plan," the AGFC said. Cory Gray, chief of the AGFC's Research Division, said, "Protecting the health of Arkansas's deer herd is our top priority. We are being very proactive in all of our CWD management areas." Protecting the health of Arkansas's deer herd is our top priority. CWD is a neurologic disease that leads to animals' deteriorating physical condition, including wasting, in deer, elk, caribou and moose. Officials first detected it in Arkansas in February 2016. Since then, the AGFC has tested more than 40,670 deer and elk for CWD, and 1,260 deer and 38 elk—or about 3% of all animals tested—have tested positive for the disease.

(NEWS10) — In December, the Department of Environmental Conservation reported a suspected avian influenza outbreak in Canada geese at Moreau Lake State Park. The DEC has since confirmed that an estimated 30 birds died. Avian influenza was detected in a couple of bodies that were sent to the DEC/Cornell’s Wildlife Health Unit (WHU) for testing. Get the latest news, weather, sports and entertainment delivered right to your inbox! Avian influenza Type A viruses can sicken or kill wild and domesticated bird species. Viruses are split into two categories: Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most cases are low pathogenic and birds either show no signs of disease or mild disease. On the other hand, HPAI can be deadly. Both Type A viruses are highly contagious. Since January 2022, the CDC has reported almost 82 million cases of HPAI in poultry and almost 9,000 cases in wild birds across the country. Data from the CDC indicate that there have been 346 known cases of HPAI in wild birds in New York over the last two years. Species that have tested positive include Canada geese, bald eagles, and red-tailed hawks. In 2024, there have been 23 cases of HPAI in New York. Reports came from ten counties, including Columbia and Saratoga counties. NYS DEC Commissioner leaving position While the virus is highly contagious among birds, human cases are rare. There has only been one case of HPAI and four cases of LPAI reported in the U.S. The patient with HPAI reported fatigue but recovered with treatment. The influenza antiviral drug oseltamivir was administered. Although the risk to the general public remains low, the CDC offers the following tips to protect yourself: Avoid direct contact with wild birds, as they can be infected even if they don’t appear sick. Avoid unprotected contact with poultry that appear sick or have died. Do not touch surfaces that could be contaminated with saliva, mucous, or feces from birds. Those who handle birds for work should use protective equipment and wash their hands with soap after touching birds. Change clothes before contact with healthy domestic poultry and after handling wild birds. Hunters should dress game birds in the field, when possible, and wear protective gear. Bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds. Anyone who becomes sick within ten days of exposure to an infected bird should isolate until they can prove they don’t have the virus or have recovered from illness. Contact your local or state public health department. They can assist in monitoring. Individuals who locate a dead bird can contact a nearby DEC Regional Wildlife Office. The DEC advises to stay a safe distance and to avoid touching it. New Yorkers can also contact the Wildlife Health Unit directly at (518) 478-2203 or wildlifehealth@dec.ny.gov.

It brings together Member States, industry, other stakeholders and WHO to implement a global approach to pandemic influenza preparedness and response. The Framework includes a benefit-sharing mechanism called the Partnership Contribution (PC). The PC is collected as an annual cash contribution from influenza vaccine, diagnostic, and pharmaceutical manufacturers that use the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). Funds are allocated for: (a) pandemic preparedness capacity building; (b) response activities during the time of an influenza pandemic; and (c) PIP Secretariat for the management and implementation of the Framework. This report presents overall success metrics and infographics to illustrate progress in PIP Framework implementation. A progress report is published four times a biennium, and covers technical and financial implementation for the PIP PC High-Level Implementation Plan II (HLIP II), as well as the PIP Secretariat. Milestones are reported every six months and indicators are reported yearly. All data are presented cumulatively from the beginning of each biennium, in this case, 1 January 2022.

They're easy to precisely produce. They're safe, and potentially more effective. And they could require smaller doses. Because of these traits, there is much interest in developing recombinant influenza vaccines. To date, however, the Food and Drug Administration has approved only one such vaccine. A University at Bufalo-led research team hopes to add to that number. It is developing a new recombinant flu vaccine – described in a study published today in the journal Cell Reports Medicine – that has the potential to compete with existing vaccines. Because of the variable nature of the viruses that cause influenza, current vaccines are not optimally effective among the overall population. We believe our vaccine candidate has the potential to improve upon this by inducing stronger and broader immunity, and reducing the likelihood of illness and death." Jonathan Lovell, PhD, study senior co-author, SUNY Empire Innovation Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at UB Conventional flu vaccines contain either deactivated microbes that cause influenza, or they are based on weakened forms of the disease. They are made using fertilized chicken eggs or, less commonly, through cell culture-based production. The vaccine the UB-led team is developing is based on a nanoliposome – a tiny spherical sac – that Lovell and colleagues created called cobalt-porphyrin-phospholipid, or CoPoP. The CoPoP platform enables immune response promoting proteins to be displayed on the surface of the nanoliposome, resulting in potent vaccine efficacy. (While not part of this study, the CoPoP vaccine platform underwent phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials in South Korea and the Philippines as a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. This is a partnership between UB spinoff company POP Biotechnologies, co-founded by Lovell, and South Korean biotech company EuBiologics.) Related StoriesRecruitment underway for a clinical trial testing new vaccine against respiratory virusesVALANX Biotech and Fina Biosolutions Introduce ClickCRM for Rapid Conjugate Vaccine DevelopmentThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura cases after CoronaVac raise concerns over vaccine safetyAlone, these nanoliposomes do not fight disease. But when combined with recombinant influenza proteins that can be generated based on genetic information from viruses, they enhance the immune system's response to disease. In the new study, the team attached to the nanoliposome a total of six proteins – three each from two different protein groups, hemagglutinins and neuraminidases. The team also added two adjuvants (PHAD and QS21) to boost immune response. Researchers evaluated the resulting "hexaplex" nanoliposome in animal models with three common flu strains: H1N1, H3N2 and type B. Even when administered in low doses, the hexaplex nanoliposome provided superior protection and survival from H1 and N1 when compared to Flublok, which is the sole licensed recombinant influenza vaccine in the U.S., and Fluaid, an egg-based vaccine. Tests showed comparable levels of protection against H3N2 and type B viruses. The tests were performed via vaccination and through blood serum transfer from vaccinated mice into non-vaccinated mice. "The combination of the two groups of proteins led to synergistic effects. In particular, the adjuvanted nanoliposomes excelled in the production of functional antibodies and the activation of T cells, which are critical to fighting off serious infection of the flu," says lead author Zachary Sia, a PhD candidate in Lovell's lab. Bruce Davidson, PhD, research associate professor of anesthesiology in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at UB, is a senior co-author of the study. He says "using not only hemagglutinin but also neuraminidase antigens to create vaccines is important because it translates into broader immunity and companies will be able to create more doses with less materials. That's critical for not only the flu but also potential outbreaks like what we saw with COVID-19. There is still much work to be done in fully testing and validating this flu technology, but at this point these early results are quite promising." In addition to UB, study co-authors include scientists from McGill University. Patents related to this work have been filed with The Research Foundation for the State University of New York. Lovell and study co-author Wei-Chiao Huang, postdoctoral scholar in Lovell's lab, are employed by POP Biotechnologies. The study was funded, in part, by the National Institutes of Health.

One of them, Celldemic (zoonotic influenza vaccine (H5N1)(surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted, prepared in cell cultures)), is intended for immunisation during outbreaks of influenza coming from animals, including when public health authorities anticipate a possible pandemic. The other, Incellipan (pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted, prepared in cell cultures)), is a pandemic preparedness vaccine intended for use only if a flu pandemic has been officially declared. In the event of a pandemic, once the virus strain causing the pandemic is identified, the manufacturer can include this strain in the authorised pandemic preparedness vaccine and apply for the vaccine to be authorised as a 'final' pandemic vaccine. Because the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine has already been assessed with other potential pandemic strains, the authorisation of the final pandemic vaccine can be accelerated.The CHMP recommended granting a conditional marketing authorisation for Filspari* (sparsentan) for the treatment of primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy, a disease where the kidneys gradually stop working and eventually fail, requiring patients to undergo dialysis or have a kidney transplant.The CHMP recommended granting a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances for Qalsody* (tofersen), a new therapy for the treatment of adult patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rare and often fatal disease that causes muscles to become weak and leads to paralysis. Thismedicine is indicated for the treatment of adults with ALS, who have a mutation in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. See more details in the news announcement in the grid below.Tizveni (tislelizumab) received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer in adults.The CHMP gave a positive opinion for Voydeya* (danicopan), the first oral treatment against residual haemolytic anaemia in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, a rare genetic disorder and potentially life-threatening blood disease leading to the premature destruction of red blood cells by the immune system. This medicine was supported through EMA’s Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme, which provides early and enhanced scientific and regulatory support for promising medicines with a potential to address unmet medical needs. See more details in the news announcement in the grid below.Zynyz* (retifanlimab) received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma, an aggressive, life-threatening skin cancer with a poor outcome when advanced.The committee recommended granting a marketing authorisation for Pyzchiva (ustekinumab), a biosimilar medicine intended for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, including paediatric plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, a disease causing inflammation of the gut.Two generic medicines also received a positive opinion from the committee: Apremilast Accord (apremilast), for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis and Behçet’s disease, a rare type of inflammatory disease which affects many parts of the body; and Nintedanib Accord (nintedanib) for the treatment of adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases with a progressive phenotype, and systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease.Recommendations on extensions of therapeutic indication for six medicinesThe committee recommended extensions of indication for six medicines that are already authorised in the European Union (EU): Carvykti*, Cibinqo, Kalydeco, Keytruda, Reblozyl* and Xromi.Re-examination of recommendationsThe applicants for Nezglyal* and Syfovre have requested a re-examination of EMA’s opinions of January 2024. Upon receipt of the grounds of the request, the Agency will re-examine its opinions and issue final recommendations.Outcome of arbitration proceduresThe CHMP completed a review of Ibuprofen NVT following a disagreement among EU Member States regarding its authorisation. The committee considered that bioequivalence of Ibuprofen NVT 400 mg to its reference medicine had not been shown and concluded that the benefits of this medicine do not outweigh its risks. The marketing authorisation granted in Lithuania cannot be recognised in Spain, where the company had applied for a marketing authorisation. In addition, the marketing authorisations in Lithuania and other Member States where the medicine is authorised (Estonia, France, Latvia, Poland and Romania) should be suspended.For more information, see the Q&A document in the grid below.Agenda and minutesThe agenda of the February 2024 CHMP meeting is published on EMA's website.

The presence of the virus was confirmed after a few birds died out of two related flocks of around 14,000 broiler breeders, according to the official notification to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). Located in the Minamisatsuma city area in Kagoshima prefecture, the two flocks were epidemiologically linked. The source of the infection is unknown. This is the country’s ninth HPAI outbreak of the season, and it occurred on the most southwestern main island of Kyushu.Just a few days previously, the Japanese authority had registered two further HPAI outbreaks in poultry linked to the H5N1 HPAI virus.At the end of January, some of the 24 birds in a backyard flock tested positive for the virus. Affected was a premises in Yamaguchi prefecture in western Honshu.Soon afterwards, the infection was confirmed among more than 103,700 birds in two epidemiologically linked farms in Kagawa. This prefecture is located on Shikoku, a large island south of Honshu. As well as the H5N6 virus recently detected, Japan has registered eight HPAI outbreaks in poultry linked to the H5N1 serotype so far this winter.Since November, around 654,000 poultry in Japan have been impacted by disease linked to the H5N1 virus variant. Japanese authorities have also registered with WOAH cases in wild birds that have tested positive for the H5N1, H5N5, and H5N6 serotypes. 6 more poultry outbreaks in TaiwanIn its latest notification to WOAH, Taiwanese authorities have confirmed five more outbreaks linked to the H5N1 virus.All of these began in January, and hit farms in the county of Yunlin. Involved were two flocks each of meat ducks and native chickens, and one of meat geese. These brought to 10 the number of outbreaks in the territory since November of last year. Directly impacted have been more than 91,000 commercial poultry.Furthermore, Taiwan News has since reported that around 9,600 native chickens have been culled in Pingtung county. After a spike in mortality, they had tested positive for the same virus variant. HPAI hits Cambodian village flocks againFollowing a brief hiatus, the H5N1 HPAI virus has been detected again in village poultry in Cambodia.Based on the latest reports to WOAH, birds first tested positive for the virus in the southern province of Prey Veng on January 24. By the first week of February, two further outbreaks were confirmed — firstly in the northwestern province of Siem Riep, and then in Kratie in the northeast of the country. So far, the number of backyard poultry involved has passed 3,900.The previous outbreak series linked to the same virus variant was declared ended in January. It had involved around 3,000 poultry in six village flocks across five provinces, including Prey Veng and Siem Riep. Outbreaks on 2 South Korean poultry farmsIn December of last year, South Korea reported its first cases of HPAI linked to the H5N6 virus serotype in poultry since 2018.Total outbreaks in this population have risen to 26 with notifications to WOAH of the most recent two outbreaks in commercial ducks. These affected premises with 10,000 birds in South Jeolla, and 29,000 in South Chungcheong. There have been previous cases in both of these provinces.Around the same time, South Korea recorded its first HPAI outbreaks linked to the H5N1 virus of the winter season. So far, this serotype has been detected at five farms, bringing the nation’s total HPAI outbreaks for the season so far to 31. These have directly involved more than 2.08 million commercial poultry. Avian flu developments in poultry elsewhere in AsiaFollowing a five-month hiatus, the H5N1 HPAI virus has been detected again in the Sakhalin region in Russia’s Far Eastern federal district.According to the WOAH notification, presence of the virus was confirmed after more than 107,000 birds died out of total flock of over 294,000 birds. Source of the infection is unknown.Sakhalin is a large island in Northeast Asia. In two towns in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, HPAI has been detected after thousands of poultry died, reported India Today last week. Chicken shops within a 10pkm radius of the outbreaks were immediately closed. Subsequently, a Times of India report confirmed the presence of the H5N1 virus serotype in the Nellore district. Rearing of chickens in the two outbreak epicenters has been banned for a period of three months, and after that, flock sizes will be limited to no more than 20 birds. The Philippines’ animal health authority has retrospectively reported to WOAH a further seven HPAI in poultry linked to the H5N1 virus in the Central Luzon region. Starting in the period June 11 to November 30 were six outbreaks in backyard flocks, and one on a farm. Each of the individual outbreaks involved flocks of between five and 9,000 birds.Since the first cases in this disease wave in January of 2022, WOAH has been notified of 256 outbreaks affecting a total of almost 2.1 million poultry in the Philippines. Further human cases in Cambodia, Laos market closedEarlier this month, the health agency of Cambodia informed the World Health Organization (WHO) about two human infections with the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus.Both started in January. For a three-year-old boy in the southern province of Prey Veng, symptoms started on January 1. Later in the month, presence of the virus was detected in a 69-year-old man from Siem Reap in the northwest of the country.Earlier this month, AvianFluDiary reported a further human case related to a virus of avian origin. This involved a nine-year-old boy in the northeastern province of Kratie, who has died from the infection. Investigations revealed that a number of chickens and ducks at the family home had died, and been eaten. The case brings Cambodia’s total cases linked to this virus family in less than 12 months to nine. This is the highest total in any country within one year in any country since 2015.All eight of the nation’s previous cases were linked to the 2.3.2.1c clade, which is an older form that generally circulated before the current dominant one, clade 2.3.4.4b, according to the same source.In Laos, a live bird market in the capital city Vientiane was temporarily closed earlier this month. According to FluTrackers, this followed the detection of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses in chicken, duck, and environmental samples at the premises. China reports Influenza virus co-infectionAlso in Asia, an unusual case has been reported in China. A 63-year-old woman from the Xuancheng region of Anhui province became unwell at the end of November, and died the following month. It emerged that she had become infected with a seasonal flu virus (H3N2) and the H10N5 variant of avian origin, according to FluTrackers citing a report in People’s Daily.The patient was a farmer, and had underlying health conditions. A few days before the onset of symptoms, she had bought a duck from a live bird market. Remains of the meal tested positive for the H10N5 virus.According to WHO, avian influenza A(H10) subtype viruses are known to occur worldwide in birds. In both domestic and wild species, they are classed as “low pathogenic.” They have been found rarely to infect mammals such as pigs, but until now, infections in humans have been rare.

By TZVI JOFFRE FEBRUARY 18, 2024 22:41 Workers from the Agriculture Ministry in protective gear retrieving dead cranes who were infected with the Avian Influenza (bird flu) from the Hula Lake in the Hula Valley Nature Reserve, northern Israel, January 2, 2022. (photo credit: MORAZ BROM/FLASH90) Dozens of cranes have been killed in an outbreak of bird flu in the Hula Valley in northern Israel in recent weeks, raising concerns of a large outbreak similar to the one that killed thousands of cranes from 2021-2022.In light of the outbreak, the Hula Nature Reserve has been closed, according to the Nature and Parks Authority. The Authority is working with government ministries to try and combat the outbreak.Despite the announcement that government ministries were working to fight the outbreak, as of Thursday, the dozens of crane carcasses in the reserve had not been cleared up, despite the existence of clear policies instituted after the outbreak in 2021-2022. According to Ynet, there is no budget available for clearing the carcasses, an operation estimated to cost about NIS 5,000 a day due to the war.Ofer Barnea, CEO of the Upper Galilee Agricultural Co., told Ynet that because the Nature and Parks Authority has stopped feeding the cranes in the Hula Nature Reserve in order to prevent them from crowding together, the cranes have spread to nearby fields, damaging crops. Workers in protective gear seen in Moshav Givat Yoav, in northern Israel, December 29, 2021, following an outbreak of avian influenza (credit: MICHAEL GILADI/FLASH90)Efi Naim, the director of the Hula Valley area for KKL-JNF, told Calcalist that in general there are fewer cranes in the Hula Nature Reserve than in past years due to a variety of factors including global warming.The Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel said it had sent a letter to Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter requesting that his office begin managing the situation immediately in cooperation with the relevant bodies in order to clear out the carcasses. The Agriculture Ministry has insisted that the handling of the situation is the responsibility of the Nature and Parks Authority and KKL-JNF, not the Agriculture Ministry."The unusual event about two years ago in the [Hula] Lake was transferred to our care due to the inability of the other parties to manage the event," added the Ministry. "The budget for handling the event will be provided by the National Security Council. The current incident is minor and limited in radius and the number of birds, therefore the treatment should be carried out immediately by Nature and Parks Authority and KKL-JNF according to the professional guidelines of the Agriculture Ministry."The latest outbreak in Israel comes just a few weeks after two gulls were found infected with the H5N1 subtype of bird flu near Binyamina-Givat Ada and Holon. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now Global bird flu outbreak continuesSince 2021, Europe and the Americas have been suffering from a nearly continuous outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza which has been described as "the largest-ever" on the three continents. The virus has affected tens of millions of birds and thousands of mammals worldwide. Outbreaks of the virus have also become more common in Africa and Asia in the past year and even spread to Antarctica.According to a new report published by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds' (RSPB) HPAI Seabird Survey Project last week, tens of thousands of seabirds in the UK have been killed since 2021, with severe declines reported in the breeding numbers of many species in the past few years.Additionally, an early-release article published by the peer-reviewed journal Emerging Infectious Diseases analyzing scientific literature about bird flu infections in mammals, including humans, in the ongoing global outbreak, found that H5N1 is expanding to new continents and spreading to new species. The analysis noted that while it could be that the infections are simply being caused by there being more birds infected with the virus, meaning scavengers are more likely to eat infected birds, it could also be that the dynamics of the virus itself are changing. The scientists noted that some studies have shown that mammal-to-mammal transmission may have occurred in infected tigers, minks, and species such as sea lions, although further research is needed."If mammal-to-mammal transmission occurs during the current H5N1 panzootic, such transmission could imply that the virus mutated to enable virus replication in mammal tissues," wrote the scientists, adding that some researchers have reported mutations that could indicate an adaptation for infecting mammals, although further research is needed.In China, the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) in late January that they had found a confirmed case of a woman infected with both the H10N5 strain of the bird flu and the H3N2 strain of the regular seasonal flu. This is the first such case of human infection with H10N5.The WHO stated that "currently available epidemiologic information suggests that avian influenza A(H10Nx) viruses have not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. Thus, the likelihood of human-to-human spread is considered low."Additionally, last week, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told Congress that the US is about 18 months away from being able to find a vaccine that can address the current strain of avian influenza spreading among poultry. "The problem of course is it mutates so you have to basically create ultimately a vaccine that is available for all strains," said Vilsack, noting as well that there are questions concerning how to vaccinate the hundreds of thousands of birds that would need to be vaccinated.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags agriculture Virus bird flu Hula Valley Hot Opinion Change the climate: Israel’s environmental potential at COP29 and regional impact By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

By José Longino Torres | CONECTA National News Desk - 02/20/2024 Photo Shutterstock Given the rising number of respiratory infections with the coming of winter, discover the main differences between COVID-19 and influenza. TecSalud infectious disease specialist Dr. Gloria Aguirre explained that other diseases are doing the rounds too, such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus, which have shown an upward trend in the last few weeks. “If you have already come down with a viral respiratory infection, make sure your COVID and influenza vaccines are up to date; having been infected does not exempt you from reinfection from other strains,” she warned. CONECTA reveals the main differences between COVID and influenza. In the case of influenza, symptoms appear suddenly and abruptly along with a high fever. What’s the difference between COVID and influenza? Dr. Aguirre listed the main differences between COVID and influenza. “Influenza can be differentiated from the COVID-19 Omicron variant and other infections that cause the common cold, such as rhinovirus and RSV, by the sudden manifestation of symptoms, high-grade fever, severe body aches, joint pain, and severe headaches.” Sudden onset commonly occurs from one day to the next along with a fever of at least 38-39 degrees. “(In the case of influenza) your general state of wellbeing comes under siege: body aches, joint pain, and muscle pain. Nasal congestion may be experienced. Coughing is not so frequent,” she said. COVID-19 usually comes on more gradually. “(With COVID-19) I have a sore throat one day and the next day I have congestion. And the day after that I start feeling weaker, and so on.” She said that fever is one way of telling the two diseases apart. “Fever is usually more common in influenza, and it is a higher grade of fever. Also, there is much more extreme fatigue. People complain a lot about aches and pains. In the case of COVID, the fever is not so high and its symptoms, in general, are: A sore throat that causes dryness and itching Mild fever Runny nose Sneezing Mild to moderate fatigue Headache Higher number of cases during winter months The specialist mentioned that, according to Ministry of Health epidemiology reports, positive PCR testing for COVID-19 stands at 14% nationwide. However, the numbers of cases are much lower as compared to previous years, with significantly less impact on hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19. The specialist mentioned that transmission of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus has become more common during recent weeks and is on a par with COVID-19. “Even the number of hospitalizations from influenza pneumonia exceeds COVID for 2023-2024.” Dr. Aguirre said that although there has been an increase in the number of cases of viral respiratory infections, most have not required hospitalization. “In the case of COVID-19, the number of cases and hospitalizations have been much lower in comparison with previous years. “Compared to pre-pandemic and pandemic years, the number of influenza cases in the last two seasons has been higher.” “Compared to pre-pandemic and pandemic years, the number of influenza cases in the last two seasons has been higher.” Main precautions: face masks and vaccinations The infectious disease specialist suggested the use of masks and vaccinations as general prevention measures. “Mainly, wear masks in enclosed or poorly ventilated places to prevent transmission.” She suggested completing the full course of vaccinations to reduce the risk of complications such as pneumonia. The main vaccinations include those for COVID, influenza, RSV, and pneumococcus. Consult your doctor to review and optimize your vaccination program. Also, keep as safe a distance from others as possible and wash your hands regularly with alcohol solutions and/or soap. Finally, the specialist recommended getting tested if you have symptoms or if you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or the flu. On another note, the infectious disease specialist warned that quick tests for influenza have a sensitivity of 50 to 60%. “If a quick test gives a negative result, don’t rule out the possibility of having influenza,” she said. “If you have already been sick with a viral respiratory infection, make sure your COVID and influenza vaccinations are up to date; having been infected does not exempt you from reinfection.” The use of masks and vaccination are the main preventive measures for containing the spread of respiratory diseases. What should I do if I become infected? Stay in quarantine for five to seven days until the symptoms disappear. Always wear a face mask. Follow your doctor’s indications and don’t self-medicate. Monitor your oxygenation with an oximeter. Dr. Aguirre pointed out that most cases involve the upper respiratory tract. This, in addition to the fact that a large part of the population has already been vaccinated or infected, means that the prognosis of most cases is mild. Seek urgent medical attention if... You have difficulty breathing. Your oxygenation level is below 90%.

A Charles County, Maryland, property is under quarantine after officials detected a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a backyard bird flock, the state Department of Agriculture announced Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Services Laboratory is working to confirm the results, with findings expected in the coming days, according to a news release. A spokeswoman for the Maryland agency told WTOP the affected flock contains chickens, ducks and one goose. Affected birds that hadn’t already died from the disease have been or are in the process of being euthanized. Maryland Department of Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks urged all poultry growers, operators and backyard flock owners to remain vigilant. “Regardless of flock size, biosecurity remains the most effective way to prevent the spread of this disease among poultry,” Atticks said in a statement. Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a highly contagious airborne respiratory virus that spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. This virus affects chickens and turkeys, along with some wild bird species such as ducks and geese. For those who suspect a case of bird flu on their property, the Maryland Department of Agriculture recommends taking the following steps: Look for signs of illness. Know the warning signs of infectious bird diseases. Report suspected sick birds by calling the Maryland Department of Agriculture at 410-841-5810.

Unfortunately, for many, getting the vaccine for influenza conjures up unpleasant memories of a yearly visit to the doctor’s office, lengthy queues, a painful jab and a sore arm. That may become a thing of the past.AdvertisementImagine only having to get a dose once every 3 years, and having it as a nasal spray. This is the aim of a project being carried out through the Hong Kong Jockey Club Global Health Institute.University of Hong Kong (HKU) researchers worked for more than six years on two vaccines which aim to provide protection against multiple subtypes of influenza A, and also last much longer than current vaccines.Researchers hope the new joint initiative between HKU, University of Cambridge, and the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul can accelerate the process and lead to clinical trials in as few as 5 years.Nasal sprays can stimulate the immune system in the respiratory tract, helping to actually prevent infections, and would provide protection for at least a few years.Current flu vaccines tend to help reduce serious complications, rather than prevent the infection in the first place. And since the flu strains keep changing, the current vaccines must be administered annually.AdvertisementReducing the burden of viral respiratory infections on adults Skip to content Skip to navigation Skip to footer Search Menu Search Search Search Close What science can do What science can do Stories of impact Publications Close R&D R&D Our approach Our approach STEM at AstraZeneca Precision medicine Transformative science Data science & AI Clinical innovation Digital health Our technologies Next generation therapeutics R&D strategic centres Featured website AstraZeneca Clinical Trials Featured website Open Innovation Close Our therapy areas Our therapy areas Oncology BioPharmaceuticals Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism Respiratory & Immunology Vaccines and Immune Therapies Rare Disease Pipeline All medicines Close Our company Our company Our history Our people Our people Oncology BioPharmaceuticals Rare Disease Research & Development Enabling functions Operations International Our leadership Cambridge Gothenburg Gaithersburg Close Careers Careers Great place to work Inclusion and diversity Learning and development Employee resource groups Close Investors Investors Investor Relations (Global) Investor Relations (Sweden) Resources Governance Shareholder information Dividend policy Key facts FAQs Debt Investors ADR Programme Feature 9M and Q3 2024 results Feature Results and presentations Close Media Media Press Releases Articles Image library Broadcast videos Archive Media contacts Investor Day 2024 Close Sustainability Sustainability Access to healthcare Access to healthcare Equitable access Affordability and pricing Health system resilience Environmental protection Environmental protection Ambition Zero Carbon Product sustainability Natural resources Ethics and transparency Ethics and transparency Ethical business culture Inclusion and diversity Workforce safety and health Partnerships, alliances and recognition Supporting our communities Resources Resources Our sustainability impact Feature Our sustainability impact Close Partnering Partnering Our business development teams Our areas of partnering interest Why partner with AstraZeneca? Information for Suppliers A Catalyst Network Close AstraZeneca Websites Global site Reducing the burden of viral respiratory infections on aging adults PUBLISHED 19 February 2024 For aging populations, viral respiratory infections can be a formidable challenge. The collective burden of respiratory infections can diminish quality of life for older adults and places substantial strain on healthcare systems worldwide, requiring a comprehensive and proactive approach to prevention.1 At AstraZeneca, we strive to reduce these burdens through innovative technologies that maximise the potential of vaccines and protect as many people as possible, especially those who are at highest risk of severe outcomes from respiratory viruses. The impact of viral respiratory infections on high-risk populations As the population of adults aged 60 years and above is expected to more than double in the next 35 years, addressing the needs of this aging group has emerged as a significant global priority.1 Viral respiratory infections such as COVID-19, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are common in older adults and can exacerbate morbidity, presenting an especially burdensome challenge on quality of life and healthcare systems overall.1 The burden of respiratory infections in older populations was highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with increased age proving to be the biggest risk factor for morbidity and mortality.1 The presence of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular, renal and respiratory diseases, as well as other co-morbidities are common in older adults and are top risk factors for contracting severe viral respiratory infections.1 The prevalence of multi-morbidities coupled with a decreased physiological reserve, a waning immune system and a greater likelihood of atypical symptom presentation are driving factors behind why viral respiratory infections are more burdensome in older adults.1 Influenza, COVID-19, RSV and hMPV are among the five respiratory viruses in the US tracked by the CDC in older adults and lower respiratory tract infections overall are the leading cause of hospitalisation in elderly patients with infectious disease2,3. For example, most adult cases of RSV, a common and contagious virus, occur among older adults with an estimated 60,000-160,000 hospitalisations and 6,000-10,000 deaths annually in the US.4 RSV infection can cause serious complications such as pneumonia or exacerbation of congestive heart failure, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.5 Like RSV, hMPV causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections that can be more severe in older adults and people with weakened immune systems.6 Research shows that in a population where 78% were vaccinated for influenza, hospitalisations associated with hMPV and RSV were almost double that of influenza hospitalisation rates.7 Older adults with hMPV infection may have viral pneumonia, worsening asthma or COPD symptoms.8 On top of the already burdensome physical impacts, respiratory infections like RSV and hMPV in older adults and those with weakened immune systems can profoundly affect their quality of life.1 Increased dependency on healthcare resources and physical discomfort are just two of many factors that can lead to heightened emotional and psychological distress. Prevention and next-generation vaccines Increased awareness of the risks of contracting respiratory disease over 60 years of age is critical in ensuring this vulnerable population is taking basic and essential steps in prevention, such as washing hands often, staying home when sick and keeping vaccinations up to date. The importance of vaccination, especially for common infections like influenza, COVID-19 and RSV, cannot be stressed enough for older adults and is reflected in recent guidelines.9-11 There are currently no treatment or prevention options for hMPV. At AstraZeneca, we are exploring innovative technologies that will offer protection against viral respiratory infections. For example, investigating combination vaccines may offer protection against more than one disease with fewer doses, offering the potential to improve access and better protect vulnerable populations. Additionally, we’re exploring the role of prophylactic monoclonal antibodies as a protective option for people who cannot mount an effective response to immunisation. Drawing upon decades of experience in vaccine development, we are harnessing our expertise to make access to next-generation vaccines a reality and ultimately lessen the burden of serious respiratory infections for everyone, particularly for the growing population of aging adults who are most vulnerable.

These oils contain chemical compounds, some of which may help to treat certain ailments, such as influenza (flu). This article outlines 10 essential oils and presents research into their effectiveness against the flu virus or flu symptoms. We also offer advice on when to contact a doctor about flu.Do essential oils work for flu? Share on PinterestTanja Ivanova/Getty ImagesMost of the research investigating the use of essential oils (EOs) for flu uses in vitro studies, meaning scientists test the EOs or their compounds against cell cultures in a test tube or petri dish. This makes it difficult for scientists to determine the effectiveness of these substances in living animals, including humans.It is also important to note that certain EOs can interact with other medications or supplements a person is taking. A person should always talk with a qualified healthcare professional and certified aromatherapist before ingesting EOs as this is generally not recommended.Topical application of certain oils can irritate the skin. Even if an essential oil is safe to apply to the skin, a person must first dilute it in a carrier oil to reduce the risk of skin damage. Two popular carrier oils are coconut oil and jojoba oil.A person can also inhale essential oils by placing one or two drops in water inside an oil diffuser. This will expel a mist around the room, dispersing the scent into the air. A person can also put one or two drops of essential oil into a bowl of hot water and then inhale the fumes. Below are 10 essential oils that may help to protect against the flu virus or treat some of the symptoms of flu.While research suggests there are health benefits, the FDA doesn’t monitor or regulate the purity or quality of essential oils. It’s important to talk with a healthcare professional before using essential oils and research the quality of a brand’s products. Always do a patch test before trying a new essential oil.1. EucalyptusEucalyptus is a genus of flowering plants consisting of more than 900 species and subspecies. Most are native to Australia and Tasmania.A 2021 review assessed the antiviral properties of Eucalyptus EOs. According to the review, Eucalyptus oil contains compounds called monoterpenes that bind with proteins on the surface of viral cells. This binding impedes the ability of the virus to enter the host’s cells. Without this ability, the virus cannot replicate itself.The review adds that Eucalyptus oil has properties that may help treat the symptoms of viral infections. These include:anti-inflammatory propertiesmucolytic properties, meaning it can break up and thin mucus so that it is easier to expel from the airwaysspasmolytic effects, meaning it helps to relieve muscle spasmsThe review concludes that Eucalyptus oil and its major monoterpenes have great potential to prevent and treat viral diseases.2. Tea treeLike eucalyptus, tea tree also contains high amounts of terpenes. A 2021 review notes that tea tree contains two terpenes called “Terpinen-4-ol” and “α‐terpineol” that demonstrate antiviral activity.3. ThymePeople have used thyme essential oil in traditional medicine to treat problems involving the upper respiratory system (consisting of the nose, mouth, and throat).This is because of the suspected anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, and antiseptic properties of thyme. According to a 2020 review, thyme EO and extracts have, in fact, shown antiviral properties against the influenza virus, as well as viruses HSV-1, HSV-2, and HIV-1.The researchers also observed that thyme EO displays some antifungal and anti-parasite properties. 4. PeppermintA 2020 review lists peppermint oil among five of the most important antiviral herbs for cold and flu.Peppermint contains the compound “menthol,” which is a common ingredient in over-the-counter cold and flu remedies. A 2017 review notes that menthol can cause a cooling sensation in the throat, which may help to soothe the throat and airways.5. LavenderA 2021 in vitro study investigated the antiviral activity of lavender and salvia essential oils against avian influenza (H5N1) virus. In this study, both EOs demonstrated antiviral activity against the virus in a laboratory setting. However, further research is necessary to determine whether these oils are effective against viruses in living organisms, including humans.Lavender is also widely renowned for its ability to promote sleep, which may prove useful for people struggling to sleep due to their flu symptoms. Indeed, a 2017 study associated a herbal supplement containing lavender with subjective improvements in sleep quality among participants with mild to moderate insomnia. 6. LemonA 2023 study investigated the effects of an aromatherapy oil blend on COVID-19 symptoms. The EO blend consisted of the following:lemonlavenderpepperminttea treeThe researchers state they selected the above EOs due to their reported effectiveness against the following ailments:respiratory tract infectionspainfatiguestressParticipants in the experimental group (EG) wore an aroma diffuser necklace during the daytime. The researchers instructed them to hold the diffuser close to their nose and inhale the EO blend for 1 minute, three times daily — in the morning, noon, and evening. A control group (CG) received their usual care over the same 4-day testing period. The study did not show any significant differences in nasal symptoms or stress between the two groups. However, the EG reported significant reductions in throat pain and fatigue compared to the CG.The study authors concluded that the EO blend may help to alleviate sore throat in people with COVID-19. It is possible that the EO blend may also help to alleviate sore throat from the flu, but scientists have yet to investigate this possibility.7. Clary sageA 2018 in vitro study of 63 essential oils investigated whether any of these were effective against the influenza A virus, and aimed to establish the compounds responsible for this antiviral activity. Of the 63 tested, 11 showed antiviral activity, and the most effective among these were:clary sagemarjoramstar aniseThe researchers noted that all three of the above EOs contain linalool, so they speculated that this compound may be responsible for the anti-influenza effect. However, further research is necessary to establish whether this is the case.8. OreganoA 2019 in vitro study investigated the antiviral effect of an EO blend consisting of oregano, thyme, and Greek sage on upper respiratory tract viruses. The study showed the blend to be effective against the following viruses:influenza A/H1N1 virus strainsinfluenza Bhuman rhinovirus 14 (HRV14) In the case of influenza A/H1N1 and HRV14, the EO blend was associated with a decrease in virus replication.The study authors concluded that the EO blend possesses antiviral activity and has the potential for use as an herbal treatment against both influenza viruses and rhinovirus. However, further research is necessary to determine whether the EO blend is effective against viruses in human participants, and to establish an effective dosing regimen.9. BergamotAn older study from 2014 found that bergamot oil vapors and certain other EO vapors had an inhibitory action on the flu virus in vitro. This inhibitory action was primarily due to a compound in bergamot oil called “citronellol.” A 2019 review also notes that bergamot and various other EOs have strong antiviral properties against the SARS-CoV-1 virus. The study authors suggest inhaling these EOs via a diffuser or nebulizer could serve as a supportive treatment for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). It is not clear from this study whether inhaling bergamot would have similar therapeutic effects against influenza viruses.A person should use bergamot carefully, as using too much can be toxic. There have been a few reports of bergamot oil causing the skin to be susceptible to sunburn when used topically.10. CinnamonA 2018 in vitro study found that cinnamon extract dampens the TLR2 and TLR4 signaling pathways involved in inflammation and that this effect is most likely due to two compounds in cinnamon called “rans-cinnamaldehyde” and “p-cymene.”Influenza viruses can cause inflammation of the sinuses, throat, and airways. In theory, cinnamon EO may help to alleviate these inflammatory effects of flu, but scientists have yet to conduct such studies in human participants.Contacting a doctorAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people with flu experience mild illness that does not require medical care.However, a person should contact a qualified healthcare professional if they experience flu symptoms and are at increased risk of flu-related complications. This includes adults over 65 years, children under 5 years, and people with chronic medical conditions. Certain flu symptoms warrant emergency medical care. Anyone who experiences any of the following should seek urgent treatment:shortness of breath or breathing difficultiespersistent pain or pressure in the chest or abdomenpersistent dizzinesspersistent confusionseizureslack of urinationsevere muscle pain and weaknessa fever or cough that improves but then returns or worsensworsening of chronic medical conditionsLearn more about flu symptoms to look out for in children.SummaryEssential oils are plant oils containing natural chemicals or compounds, some of which may help to protect against the flu virus or treat flu symptoms.Research into the effectiveness of essential oils against flu mainly uses in vitro studies, meaning it is difficult for scientists to determine how these substances will work against the flu virus in humans and other living organisms. A person who is considering using an essential oil should first contact a qualified healthcare professional to determine whether the oil is suitable for their use. Some essential oils are toxic if ingested, and some cause irritation when applied to the skin. Always keep them away from pets and children.They may also interact with other medications or supplements a person is taking. As such, a person should enquire about an essential oil before using it for the first time.Flu / Cold / SARSComplementary Medicine / Alternative MedicineFluHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

Children born in October are more likely to be vaccinated against influenza and less likely to be diagnosed with influenza than children born in other months, according to a US study published in The BMJ. Children born in October least likely to get influenza: Study(Unsplash) According to the findings, the birth month is connected with both the timing of flu vaccination and the chance of a flu diagnosis, and October is the best time for young children to get a flu shot, in line with existing guidelines. Annual influenza vaccine is especially critical for young children, who are more likely to have the flu and develop a serious condition that requires hospitalisation. Vaccination is advised in September or October to boost immunity during peak flu season. ALSO READ: Flu season is here; important tips to prevent influenza in kids Among young children in the United States, preventive care visits tend to occur during birth months and are a convenient time to receive the influenza vaccine, but large-scale studies of the optimal timing of vaccination are unavailable. To address this, researchers set out to assess the optimal timing of influenza vaccination in young children. Using health insurance claims data, they identified over 800,000 children aged 2-5 years who received an influenza vaccination between August 1 and January 31 during 2011-18. They then analysed rates of diagnosed influenza among these children by birth month. After accounting for a range of potentially influential factors such as age, sex, existing conditions, healthcare use and family size, the results show that October was the most common month for children to be vaccinated. Children born in October also had the lowest rate of influenza diagnosis. For example, among children born in August, the average rate of influenza diagnosis across flu seasons studied was 3% compared with 2.7% for children born in October and 2.9 per cent for those born in December. This is an observational study and the authors acknowledge that their findings are limited to insured children who received medical care. Nor can they rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced their results. Nevertheless, results were similar after additional analyses to evaluate whether the relation between birth month and influenza risk was due to chance, providing greater confidence in their conclusions. "Our findings suggest that US public health interventions focused on vaccination of young children in October may yield the best protection in typical flu seasons," they said. "The study's findings are consistent with current recommendations promoting October vaccination," they added. Catch every big hit,...

That’s the message from the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and the Ohio Department of Public Health in response to rising rates of flu and respiratory illness across the state.Ohio’s flu activity is currently rated as “very high.” This is the first time the state flu rates have been designated above “high” this season. The reason is for the unusually high numbers of hospitalizations, ER visits and outpatient visits for flu-like symptoms.Normally flu season ends around March, but nearly all indicators are trending above the five-year average for this time of year, according to the latest data on the ODH website, though reporting does lag.During the week ending Feb. 10, the last weekly report, there were 558 hospitalizations due to confirmed cases of influenza in Ohio. In addition, the number of physicians visits jumped by 30%.Flu hospitalizations are highest in West Central and Northeast Ohio.However, Northeast Ohio has had the highest number of flu hospitalizations for the season, and Cuyahoga County has had the highest percentage of hospitalizations (14%) of any county in the state. Franklin County is the next highest with 9.5%.This means that Cuyahoga County is have more than its share of flu cases per capita, as the county accounts for about 10.4% of the state’s population, while Franklin county is getting fewer cases per capita, with 11.2% of the state’s population.Although the exact species of flu virus in early-February surge is unknown, CDC monitoring of this year’s flu strains shows that they have been well covered by the 2023 vaccine.Of the circulating virus thus far, 82% were found to be Influenza A, and 18% were influenza B. Among those FluA cases, 78% are subtype (H1N1) pdm09, and 22.3% are the H3N2 subtype. Meanwhile 100% of FluB cases are from the Victoria lineage of viruses.All three of these strains are included in the current vaccine. Nationally, about half of American adults have been vaccinated.Learn more about how to schedule a vaccination here.Stories by Gretchen Cuda KroenICYMI: Strokes & heart attacks typically increase after time changeStudy examines Zika virus during pregnancy and researchers develop a new stent: MediCLEOSU scientists develop stent to improve vascular surgery, drug delivery and organ donationZika virus infections during pregnancy can alter the baby’s immune system study finds OhioX and University Hospitals join forces for sports medicine technology summitIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Respiratory virus activity is high or very high in half of US states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Catherine McQueen/Moment RF/Getty Images CNN — Key measures of respiratory virus activity in the United States have been trending down for weeks, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the worst of the season may be over – but virus levels still remain elevated across the country. During the week ending on February 10, flu hospitalization rates were about half of what they were at this season’s peak at the end of December, and Covid-19 hospitalization rates were about a third lower, CDC data shows. A general view of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Tami Chappell/Reuters/FILE Related article Washington Post: CDC to ease Covid-19 isolation guidance “While the respiratory virus season is likely past its peak, it is definitely not over,” the agency wrote in an update to its website Friday. “There is still a lot of respiratory virus activity, so it’s not time to let our guard down.” Covid-19 viral levels in wastewater remain high in the US – especially in the South, where levels are twice as high as the rest of the country. Despite the improvements, thousands of people are still being hospitalized with Covid-19: more than 21,000 people during the week ending on February 10, according to the CDC. The latest data from the CDC on Covid-19 deaths is incomplete, but it estimates that there were at least 650 deaths during the week ending February 10. And overall, the share of medical visits for respiratory illness – with symptoms of a fever, along with a cough or sore throat – has been above baseline since November. Nearly 5% of all outpatient visits were for influenza-like illness in early February, well above the 3% national baseline.

BELGA PHOTO JASPER JACOBS (Photo credit should read JASPER JACOBS/AFP/Getty Images) JASPER JACOBS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Related article Millions of people have long Covid, including children and pregnant people, studies show Half of US states had high or very high respiratory virus activity during the week ending on February 10, according to the CDC. Agency forecasts show that Covid-19 infections are probably growing in a dozen states, while flu infections are growing in nine states. So far this season, there have been fewer hospitalizations for flu, Covid-19 and RSV than there were at this point last season. And this season’s peak week for respiratory virus hospitalizations happened a few weeks later and was slightly lower than last season, CDC data shows. But flu season can be unpredictable, with “significant” activity continuing through May in some years, the CDC says. And while it’s become less likely now for a Covid-19 illness to lead to severe outcomes than at previous points in the pandemic, the coronavirus continues to be a leading cause of death in the US. Vaccine uptake is slightly lower than it was at this point in the season last year, and it’s still not too late to get vaccinated against flu and Covid-19, the CDC says. Just about half of the US population has gotten the flu shot this season, while about 22% of adults and 12% of children have gotten the latest Covid-19 shot.

(WDIV)Here’s our weekly round-up of what illnesses are spreading the most in Metro Detroit communities, according to our local doctors and hospitals.Wayne County – Influenza, bacterial pneumonia, stomach viruses, Covid, upper respiratory infectionsDr. Kevin Dazy -- Children’s Hospital of Michigan PediatricianWe’re still seeing a good number of influenza cases, and in some children it’s evolving into bacterial pneumonia. Those kids need antibiotics. It worries me when I’m seeing otherwise healthy kids who require hospitalization when their influenza turns into pneumonia. It’s rare, but we have a number of kids hospitalized with it. In the last week there has been more gastroenteritis – nausea, vomiting and diarrhea – separate from influenza. We see that sporadically throughout the year, but we’re seeing a significant number of children with it right now. The vast majority of time, there’s not much we can do other than to ensure they are hydrated.Dr. Dan Taylor -- Chief of Emergency Medicine, DMC Sinai-Grace HospitalWe’re seeing a lot of flu: probably a lot of Flu B, switching over from Flu A. We’re back to a normal flu pattern, it looks like. Injuries – we always have those, but nothing out of the ordinary. And we always have our share of cardiac disease, strokes. As the weather gets better, we’ll have increased numbers generally as people get out and about.Dr. Jennifer Stevenson -- Emergency Department, Henry Ford Medical Center FairlaneThere’s still influenza and COVID-19 in the community and we continue to see patients that require hospitalization as a result. There’s also a viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu) as well as many viral (but non-COVID-19/influenza) upper respiratory infections going around. Again, I recommend that people wear masks in public when they have URI symptoms to protect our community. Hand washing also is super important to prevent the spread of stomach flu.Dr. Asha Shajahan -- Family medicine physician, Corewell Health’s Beaumont Hospital Grosse Pointe“We are still seeing flu and COVID, along with knee/back/joint pain and arthritis, especially as the weather and temperatures fluctuate. As people are beginning to see spring around the corner, we are seeing a lot of requests, an average of four a day, requesting the new and effective weight loss medications.”Oakland County – Stomach viruses, bronchiolitis, RSV, upper respiratory viruses, influenza, Covid, allergy & asthma flare-upsDr. Rena Daiza -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Bloomfield Twp.“I am currently seeing cases of bronchiolitis, a viral illness (sometimes caused by RSV) that occurs mostly in children but can also affect older adults. Adults over 60 can receive a single dose of RSV vaccine, while recommendations for infants is either via monoclonal antibody or having the mother immunized during pregnancy.”Sarah Rauner, RN -- Chief pediatric nurse practitioner, Corewell Health’s Beaumont Hospital Troy“We are seeing an increase in viral gastroenteritis. This can be a combination of vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, decreased appetite and/or fever. This is particularly difficult in little ones. Also, we’re continuing to see viral upper respiratory infections, including influenza and COVID. As our weather fluctuates, we’re seeing individuals who are experiencing some allergy and asthma issues as well. There have been a lot of children battling back-to-back illnesses, as the sick season enters its last few weeks (hopefully).”Emergency Department, Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital“We have had a lot of behavioral health patients this week in the ED. There also were a lot of pains that were mostly abdominal and weakness/fatigue.”Washtenaw County– Influenza, Covid, upper respiratory infections, stomach virusesDr. Brad Uren -- Clinical Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Michigan Medicine“Noticeable uptick in flu cases this week. Still some COVID. Few other URIs. Some GI but not a lot.”Dr. Marisa Louie -- Medical Director of Children’s Emergency Services, Michigan Medicine“We have had an increase in patients in general. Still seeing quite a bit of flu as well as COVID.”Washtenaw County Health Department“Influenza cases in Washtenaw County residents are currently at high levels. Most Influenza cases being reported in Washtenaw County are Influenza A, types A(H1N1) and A(H3). Sporadic cases of Influenza B are being reported. Influenza-related deaths in Washtenaw County adults have been reported this flu season. All individuals were older adults with confirmed Influenza A infection. Flu-related hospitalizations of Washtenaw residents are currently at high levels.”Monroe County – Upper respiratory viruses, pneumonia, stomach virusesDr. Spencer Johnson -- ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital – Emergency Center“Currently, we are still seeing a fair amount of viral URI, along with pneumonia. There also seems to be a good deal of viral GI illness within the community. The best practice is excellent hand hygiene and staying home when ill.”Macomb County – Upper respiratory viruses, influenza, Covid, RSV, asthma flare-ups, weather-related fallsDr. Joseph Flynn -- Emergency physician at McLaren Macomb“Continuing to be reported in high volumes viral upper respiratory infections (including RSV, influenza, and COVID-19) continue to be the most common reason patients are seeking care in the emergency department, presenting with fever, persistent cough, body aches, and fatigue. The vast majority of patients do not present with severe symptoms, and they can be discharged following treatment. Viral URIs have been complicating asthma sufferers’ conditions, exacerbating breathing complications. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea continue to be treated in patients suffering from viral gastroenteritis. Wintery conditions have resulted in falls and many patients suffering a traumatic orthopedic injury, mainly to the extremities, but also some head injuries.”Dr. Anthony Colucci -- Medical director at Henry Ford Macomb Hospital’s emergency department“Flu and COVID-19 are still being seen in our ED.”Dr. Dhairya Kiri -- Primary Care Physician, Henry Ford Medical Center Richmond“We are seeing a significant increase in Influenza A cases in clinic this week.”Livingston County -- Respiratory viruses, COVIDCopyright 2024 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.About the AuthorsSarah Mayberry, M.P.H. headshotSarah Mayberry, M.P.H.emailFrank McGeorge, MD headshotFrank McGeorge, MDDr. McGeorge can be seen on Local 4 News helping Metro Detroiters with health concerns when he isn't helping save lives in the emergency room at Henry Ford Hospital.emailClick here to take a moment and familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines.Loading...Recommended VideosTV ListingsEmail NewslettersRSS FeedsContests and RulesContact UsCareers at WDIVClosed Captioning / Audio DescriptionPublic FileTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoFCC ApplicationsCookie PreferencesFollow UsVisit our YouTube page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Facebook page (opens in a new tab)Visit our Instagram page (opens in a new tab)Visit our X page (opens in a new tab)Visit our RSS Feed page (opens in a new tab)Get Results With OmneIf you need help with the Public File, call (313) 222-0556.At WDIV, we are committed to informing and delighting our audience.

Two recent studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's VISION Network have found that flu vaccines were effective for all ages against both moderate and severe flu in the U.S. during the 2022-2023 flu season. Both the pediatric and adult VISION Network studies analyzed flu-associated emergency department (E.D.)/urgent care visits (indicative of moderate disease) and hospitalization (indicative of severe disease) from October 2022 through March 2023, a flu season in which far fewer individuals were social distancing or wearing masks than during the two previous flu seasons. Vaccination reduced the risk of flu-related E.D./urgent care visits and hospitalization for those 6 months to 17 years by almost half. For adults, regardless of age, vaccination reduced the risk of E.D. urgent care visits by almost half and reduced the risk of hospitalization by slightly more than a third. These results led the authors of both studies to conclude that flu vaccination is likely to substantially reduce illness, death and strain on healthcare resources. We study the effectiveness of flu and other vaccines to ensure that our processes for forecasting the most effective vaccines are working well and therefore might potentially also be translatable to other diseases as well. Given influenza's significant disease burden -- for example the H1N1 (swine) flu killed over a quarter of a million people worldwide in 2009-2010 -- we want to make sure that we understand virus trends as well as other factors and that we're continuing to do as well as and as much as we can to reduce the flu disease burden." Shaun Grannis, M.D., M.S., co-author of both the pediatric and adult VISION Network studies, Regenstrief Institute vice president for data and analytics and family practice physician Both the pediatric and adult studies evaluated electronic health record (EHR) data from sites across three healthcare systems in California, Utah, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Flu vaccine effectiveness: 2022-2023 flu season for ages 6 months to 17 years Vaccination reduced the risk of flu-related E.D./urgent care visits (moderate disease) by 48 percent and hospitalization (severe disease) by 40 percent overall across ages 6 months to 17 years. Broken down by age, risk reduction was greater for those age 6 months to 4 years than older children and adolescents. Ages 6 months to four years Vaccination reduced the risk of E.D./urgent care visits (moderate disease) by 53 percent. Vaccination reduced the risk of hospitalization (severe disease) by 56 percent. Ages 5 to 17 years Vaccination reduced the risk of E.D./ urgent care visits (moderate disease) by 38 percent. Vaccination reduced the risk of hospitalization by 46 percent. Approximately 30 percent of E.D./critical care visits for acute respiratory illness in children and adolescents were positive for flu, as were 14 percent of hospitalizations. "Vaccine Effectiveness Against Pediatric Influenza-A-Associated Urgent Care, Emergency Department, and Hospital Encounters During the 2022-2023 Season, VISION Network" is published in Clinical Infectious Diseases. Flu vaccine effectiveness: 2022-2023 flu season for ages 18-64 Vaccine effectiveness was 45 percent against E.D./critical care visits(moderate disease) for adults under age 65. Effectiveness against hospitalization (severe disease) was 23 percent.

Flu vaccine effectiveness: 2022-2023 flu season for ages 65 and older Vaccine effectiveness was 41 percent against both flu-associated E.D./urgent care visits (moderate disease) and hospitalization (serious disease) for this age group. Adults age 65 and older typically received enhanced vaccine products. "Influenza vaccine effectiveness against influenza-A-associated emergency department, urgent care, and hospitalization encounters among U.S. adults, 2022-2023" is published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. "As with COVID, the dynamics of flu differs between children and adults. But we found that for both children and adults, vaccination significantly reduced the need for trips to the E.D, or critical care center and for hospitalization for flu-related illnesses last flu season and this is encouraging," said Dr. Grannis. "I'm hopeful that we will see similar or even better vaccine effectiveness during the current flu season. Even if they do experience symptoms, people who are vaccinated typically tend to have milder, shorter cases of the flu, a viral illness which can carry a severe disease burden. "The vaccine effectiveness we saw in last year's flu season is encouraging. As both a research scientist and a primary care physician, I urge everyone to be vaccinated for flu this year and every year – it's good for each person's health and the health of your community."

Haffey/Getty Tiger Woods has broken his silence on his exit from the Genesis Invitational golf tournament and shared more about his health. The golf champion’s withdrawal from the tournament was announced on Friday, after he was carted off the course during the competition that afternoon suffering flu-like symptoms. On Saturday, Woods, 48, addressed his exit and confirmed the details of his health condition in a statement posted on X (formerly Twitter). “I would like to confirm that I had to withdraw from @thegenesisinv due to illness, which we now know is influenza,” he said. “I am resting and feeling better.” “Good luck to the players this weekend. I’m disappointed to not be there and want to thank @GenesisUSA and all the fans for the support,” Woods concluded. Woods has withdrawn from the Genesis Invitational due to influenza. Sean M. Haffey/Getty Tiger Woods Withdraws from Genesis Invitational During the Second Round Woods bowed out of the tournament when he was 1-over through six holes Friday after having back spasms along with flu symptoms. He was subsequently driven off the golf course by a rules official at 1:35 p.m. local time, according to an article posted on the PGA Tour website. The hall of fame golfer was then treated for “potential dehydration and dizziness related to his illness” by emergency personnel at the Riviera Country Club course, per PGA Tour. Woods had been suffering flu-like symptoms the previous night that worsened by Friday, Rob McNamara, EVP of TGR Ventures shared in a statement. Woods was carted off the golf course after falling ill on Friday. Sean M. Haffey/Getty Tiger Woods Announces He’s Splitting with Nike After 27 Years: ‘Another Chapter’ “He had a little bit of a fever and was better during the warm-up,” read McNamara’s Friday statement, per PGA Tour. “But then when he got out there and was walking and playing, he started feeling dizzy. Ultimately, the doctors are saying he’s got some — potentially some type of flu and that he was dehydrated.” “He’s being treated with an IV bag and he’s doing much much better and he'll be released on his own here soon,” concluded McNamara. On Thursday, Woods discussed having back spasms after attempting to hit an 8-iron from the right side of the 18th fairway. Woods also suffered back spasm prior to leaving the competition. Ben Jared/PGA TOUR via Getty "Well, my back was spasming the last couple [of] holes and it was locking up," he said, according to ESPN. "I came down and it didn't move, and I presented [the] hosel first and shanked it." In April 2023, Woods had fusion surgery on his right ankle to manage post-traumatic arthritis he suffered in a car accident in February 2021. He then took a break from competing for nearly eight months, during which time he suffered from back spasms. After competing on Thursday, per ESPN, Woods said of his right ankle, "Things are a little bit sore, but that's to be expected.” Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Through his physical strain, he managed to end the day tied for 49th, landing eight shots behind first-round leader Patrick Cantlay. "I'm going to be rusty, and I have to do a better job at home prepping," Woods said, according to the outlet. "We need to do a better job with lifting and treating and continuation of rehab protocols, all those things. I just haven't done it in a while."

FRESNO, Calif. – For two years, a massive nationwide outbreak of avian influenza has wreaked havoc on the nation’s poultry. Since February 2022, more than 80 million birds have been euthanized around the country.The hardest hit states include Iowa and Ohio. In California, the tally exceeds 7 million euthanized birds, with more than half of those – about 4.2 million – in Merced County alone.“It's a huge number, yes,” said Merced County Agricultural Commissioner Sean Runyon.Most of those were egg-laying hens, but some were chickens raised for meat as well as turkeys, ducks, and various backyard flocks. Also known as bird flu, avian influenza is extremely contagious, highly fatal to birds, and it renders all meat and eggs from the flock unsafe for human consumption.And so detecting the virus in one bird requires draconian measures: the entire flock needs to be euthanized. Runyon suspects the high local impact is due, in part, to the way the virus spreads: mostly by migratory birds. Their droppings, which can shed the virus if coming from an infected bird, contaminate waterways and can be transported on shoes, clothing and vehicle tires.“We have a large migratory bird population because we have some wildlife refuges here and I think that adds a little bit more concern to it,” Runyon said.In other respects, it shouldn’t necessarily be surprising that the consequences have been so dire for Merced County.Located in the heart of one of the nation’s most abundant agricultural belts, Merced County is home to one of the largest poultry inventories in California, and the City of Livingston houses the headquarters of poultry giant Foster Farms.Latest outbreak is among largest in the stateDr. Annette Jones, the state veterinarian at the California Department of Food and Agriculture, told KVPR in January the state had already lost 30 percent of its egg-laying chickens. She considered the latest outbreak among the largest in her two decades with the agency.“That's a pretty big impact on farms,” Jones said.Losing a flock can set a farm back months – when considering the time it takes to obtain the birds and raise them to a marketable size and age. The federal government does pay farmers for a lot of their lost profits, and it also helps protect poultry operations from losing workers. That’s because cleaning up after an outbreak requires a lot of work, too – including composting carcasses, disinfecting barns, and otherwise preparing farms for birds to return after a quarantine period. “The work is being done for the most part by the farmworkers, and that keeps them on the payroll because the federal government will support that cost,” Jones said.Sonoma County, north of San Francisco, is the state’s second-hardest hit region for bird flu. There, a little over million birds have been affected, including a commercial flock of 200,000 ducks.“Right at the beginning of January, we got one more order of duck breasts, and that was the last time we got anything,” said butcher Madisen Adkins of Panizzera Meat Company in Occidental.Her duck supplier says they’ll be out of production until March. At least one Santa Rosa restaurant has had to take duck off its menu.Bird flu impacts for consumers Kerry Klein / KVPR At a Savemart in Fresno in January, eggs cost anywhere from $3.99 to $7.99 per dozen. This strain of bird flu isn’t a public health threat to humans, but it affects us in other ways.In the San Joaquin Valley, the most obvious effect has been shortages of eggs, resulting in purchase limits and higher prices. As for why eggs haven’t been wiped out of grocery stores entirely, experts note that supply chains are generally robust enough to fill in a lot of the gaps left by the virus.Under normal circumstances, “there's a lot of birds and eggs coming into California from other states because we have so many people here,” said Bill Mattos, President of the California Poultry Federation. “We can only supply, for example, half of the eggs and half of the meat chickens that the state needs to consume…so there's got to be some birds coming in from out of the area.”Still, grocery store customers like Julie Bretz of Fresno said prices have been climbing.Standing outside Food Maxx in central Fresno on a recent day, she said she has been cutting back on making one of her favorite dishes: a soup similar to Chinese egg-drop soup.“It’s been $5 or $7 for a dozen,” she said. “That's too much.”Marylou Mendoza, another Fresno resident, works for a youth residential facility where she cooks anything from breakfast sandwiches to scrambled eggs, and chorizo and eggs. Now, however, she said she is buying around half the eggs each week that she used to.‘No bird should be going through that’Until this is all sorted, poultry caretakers like Fresno State master’s student Brenda Hernandez Tapia will keep following a suite of so-called biosecurity measures aimed at protecting the 20,000 chickens she cares for. She and other poultry science students raise the birds from when they’re newborn chicks until they’re fully grown and ready to be sent off to partner company Foster Farms for meat production.Every day, outside a long gray campus barn housing the birds, she walks over to a plastic bin full of protective equipment many might be accustomed to seeing in a hospital. She pulls on a pair of disposable plastic booties, then come coveralls, a hairnet, a mask, gloves, and a second pair of plastic booties. Lastly, she hoses her double-bootied feet off with disinfectant. Kerry Klein / KVPR Poultry caretakers and processors across the company follow strict biosecurity protocols to keep avian influenza and other viruses away from their birds. Kerry Klein / KVPR Master’s student Brenda Hernandez Tapia hoses off her feet before entering a biosecure poultry facility at Fresno State. “Maybe because I'm kind of used to it, but I don't think it's too much,” she said. “I feel like it's just necessary .. We’re making sure that we spray off any diseases that we might have come in contact with.”Avian influenza has never reached the chickens at Fresno State. But Hernandez Tapia said she monitors for any sign of infection, like nasal discharge similar to the runny noses that people can get with a case of the human flu..“They’ll look pretty tired. Their feathers will be fluffed up and…they won't want to move very much,” she said. “No bird should be going through that.”Noah Abrams of Northern California Public Media and Jovi (Zhaozhou) Dai of the Merced FOCUS and the Center for Public Integrity contributed to this story.

Neither child was part of a local outbreak. One was from the northeast part of the state and the other from the central east.The deaths come as New Jersey appears to be having a typical flu season so far — the kind often seen before the COVID-19 pandemic — ramping up in November and peaking through the winter months before weakening around late March.Story continues below photo galleryFlu transmission is high in all regions of New Jersey, according to the latest state Health Department report. Of the 110 outbreaks this season, 18 came in the three weeks prior to Feb. 17, the report says."Current activity levels for flu remain elevated both in New Jersey and nationally but it is not possible to predict how much longer the season will last," said Nancy Kearney, a Health Department spokeswoman. "It would not be unusual for cases to continue into April."'An average flu season'At Morristown Medical Center, flu, COVID-19, RSV and other respiratory diseases peaked during the holiday season in late December and since then the numbers have dropped, said Dr. Jason Kessler, head of infectious diseases at the hospital.“It’s been an average flu season,” he said. “We’re still seeing patients, but it’s not at the level we were seeing around Christmas and New Year’s.”Four New Jersey children died last year from the flu after two years with no flu deaths in the state.New Jersey saw historically low flu rates in the winter of 2020-2021, when most people were still isolating in their homes and avoiding travel during the COVID-19 pandemic.The next season was basically cut in two, with a surge in January followed by a lull in February and early March and then another surge through April.Last year, the flu season began unusually early in October as more kids returned to school maskless.

Walking pneumonia is a nonmedical term for a mild form of pneumonia. While a more typical case of pneumonia might send you to bed—or even the hospital—with walking pneumonia, you can usually go about your everyday activities, even though you likely have symptoms, including cough, fatigue, and, sometimes, fever. “It’s more of a colloquial term than an exact medical diagnosis,” explains Matthew Ellman, MD, a Yale Medicine primary care physician. Thomas Murray, MD, PhD, a Yale Medicine pediatric infectious diseases specialist, describes a typical patient with walking pneumonia as having a cough and some mild breathing difficulties that last longer than the standard three to five days of an acute respiratory infection, such as the common cold. “It isn’t severe enough that it incapacitates you, but it lingers and can make you feel uncomfortable,” he adds. Even though walking pneumonia isn’t usually serious, you should contact your doctor if you are experiencing worrisome symptoms or if a cold lasts more than five days, the doctors advise. Below, Drs. Ellman and Murray talk more about walking pneumonia, including how it is diagnosed and treated.What causes walking pneumonia?Pneumonia is caused by various microorganisms, usually bacteria and viruses. The infection usually starts after one of these microorganisms is inhaled from the upper airways into one or both lungs. There, the infection causes the air sacs, or alveoli, to fill with pus or fluid. Broadly speaking, pneumonia falls into two categories: community-acquired and hospital-acquired, the latter of which is considered more dangerous, as this type is more likely to be resistant to antibiotics. Walking pneumonia is a common subtype of community-acquired pneumonia, and is typically caused by a difficult-to-detect bacterium called Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Infections caused by this bacteria are generally mild but can sometimes be severe. There are a few different ways one can get a bacterial infection, Dr. Murray explains. “In many cases, it can happen with bacteria you are colonized with. In other words, it's already part of your upper respiratory tract. It lives in your nose or the back of your throat. When you get sick with a virus, it allows the bacteria to get into your lower lung and cause disease,” he says. “Say, for example, you’ve had the flu—that increases your risk for pneumonia afterward.” And because winter is virus season, many respiratory viruses—including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)—can travel from the upper respiratory tract to the lungs and cause pneumonia, Dr. Murray notes. Pneumonia can also spread when an infected individual coughs or sneezes, and someone else breathes in those respiratory droplets. It occurs most often in crowded settings, including schools, college dormitories, and military training sites. However, those who spend a short amount of time with someone who has a mycoplasma infection do not usually get sick, the CDC says. “In general, any type of pneumonia, particularly if it’s bacterial, is less contagious than the viruses that cause colds, flu, or COVID,” Dr. Ellman says. How is walking pneumonia diagnosed?Walking pneumonia is sometimes called an “atypical” pneumonia—a term used to describe pneumonia caused by bacteria that is difficult to detect through standard bacterial cultures. “There are blood tests that don’t work very well. There are also swabs, just like you do for COVID, to check for mycoplasma, the bacteria often associated with walking pneumonia. But not every lab does those, so they’re not easy to get,” Dr. Murray says. “And if it’s negative, it doesn’t mean you don’t have it, because you can still have symptoms after it goes away from your upper respiratory tract.” Therefore, walking pneumonia is often diagnosed by a physical exam and possibly an X-ray, Dr. Murray says. It can sometimes be hard to tell the difference between a more typical case of pneumonia and walking pneumonia, he adds. “One of the ways you can differentiate it is with a chest X-ray. A more typical pneumonia would be called ‘lobar pneumonia,’ meaning you can see that one part of the lung is infected on the X-ray,” he says. “Walking pneumonia will look patchy on the X-ray. There isn’t just one part of the lung involved; it’s more spread throughout.”How is walking pneumonia treated?While many community-acquired cases of pneumonia caused by bacteria are treated with antibiotics, the most prescribed ones, such as amoxicillin, don’t always work for mycoplasma pneumonia, Dr. Murray says. But certain antibiotics, such as azithromycin, work well, so it’s important to get the proper diagnosis, he says. “The good news is that this type of pneumonia does not tend to be serious in healthy people, and most do very well with treatment,” he says. If the pneumonia is believed to be caused by a virus, antibiotics won’t help. In fact, for children under 2 years of age, the majority of cold and lung infections are viral. Instead, those patients should rest, drink plenty of fluids, and, if needed, use over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, for discomfort. There are potential treatments for influenza, such as Tamiflu, and COVID-19, such as Paxlovid, depending on your age and underlying risk factors for complications, adds Dr. Murray. Are there vaccines for walking pneumonia?Certain types of pneumonia have vaccines to protect against them and are recommended for children and older adults, “but there isn’t a shot that covers walking pneumonia,” Dr. Murray says. “Still, it’s good to stay up to date on all recommended vaccines—including those for RSV, flu, COVID, and pneumonia caused by a common bacteria called streptococcus,” Dr. Ellman says. “All of these can help reduce the risk of getting pneumonia.” When should you contact your doctor?While most cases of walking pneumonia aren’t dangerous, it’s important to pay attention to your symptoms, particularly if you develop new problems after seemingly recovering from another illness, such as the flu. “Say you have the flu and you start to feel better, but then you begin to feel sick again—it’s more difficult to breathe, and the fever comes back. Although it’s not that common, it could be a community-acquired pneumonia setting in that requires an antibiotic,” Dr. Murray says. “That would be a great reason to reach out to your primary care doctor.” Another reason to pay attention to symptoms that aren’t resolving is that walking pneumonia can turn into a more serious form of pneumonia if left untreated. Each year, 4 to 5 million people in the United States get pneumonia (not including pneumonia caused by COVID-19), and about 55,000 people die from it. “Pneumonia is a common cause of hospitalization, and it can be life-threatening. It can cause organ damage and be complicated by cardiac and kidney problems, as well as cause permanent damage to the lungs,” Dr. Ellman says. “Because walking pneumonia can become a more serious case of pneumonia, it’s important to be in touch with your doctor.”Read more Yale Medicine newsRelated SpecialistsThomas MurrayMD, PhDMatthew EllmanMDJeffrey TopalMDMore Related SpecialistsRelated Fact SheetsPneumoniaPneumonia is an infection that inflames air sacs, which may fill with fluid, in the lungs.

Scholars from the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC) have discovered a surprising facet about a century-old vaccine for tuberculosis, Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG). The study, published in the journal Nature Immunology, uncovered a previously unknown mechanism that extends the vaccine’s shield to combat influenza A virus—the most prevalent flu strain. “The immune interactions involved here can ‘train’ the lungs, which are frequently exposed to infectious agents in the environment. If we can map out the protective immune pathways involved in the lungs, this will revolutionize our conceptual and clinical approaches in developing vaccines against infections, including emergent respiratory viruses,” explains lead author Maziar Divangahi, a pulmonary immunologist, a senior scientist at the RI-MUHC, and a Professor of Medicine at McGill University. The discovery paves the way for future studies to assess whether BCG could be used to prevent other emergent viruses. Notably, research on the vaccine’s protection against COVID-19 has had promising results. About the study “BCG immunization induces CX3CR1hi effector memory T cells to provide cross-protection via IFN-γ-mediated trained immunity” by Kim Tran et al. was published in Nature Immunology.

Researchers from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University in China searched three databases for English-language, peer-reviewed studies on mpox symptoms published from January 1970 to April 2023. The periods covered included 1970 to 2022 (period 1, within Africa), 2003 to 2021 (period 2, mostly within Africa, but clusters elsewhere), and 2022 to 2023 (period 3, worldwide). The 61 included studies reported on 21 symptoms in 720 mpox patients from period 1, 39 symptoms from 1,756 patients from period 2, and 37 symptoms from 12,277 patients from period 3. The findings were published late last week in JMIR Public Health and Surveillance. Rash common to all 3 periods The most common symptom in all three periods was rash (period 1, 92.6%; period 2, 100%; and period 3, 94.8%), followed by enlarged lymph nodes (period 1, 59.8%; period 2, 74.1%; and period 3, 61.1%). In period 1, the primary symptoms were fever (99%), enlarged lymph nodes (80.5%), and headache (69.1%), with a significant decline in these symptoms in period 3 (37.9%, 31.2%, and 28.7%, respectively). Epidemic countries may shift their focus on the potential association among symptoms and the high synergy risk. In period 2, chills/shivering (73.3%), fatigue (68.2%), and difficulty swallowing (61.2%) emerged as the main symptoms but fell off significantly in period 3. In period 3, most other symptoms were similarly prevalent or declined relative to periods 1 and 2. Nausea/vomiting correlated most closely with 13 symptoms and was highly positively correlated with enlarged lymph nodes and conjunctivitis ("pink eye") in period 2. During period 3, rash and headache were both most closely correlated with 21 symptoms and were highly positively correlated with fever. "It is necessary to surveil the evolving nature of mpox and the consequential changes in clinical characteristics," the study authors wrote. "Epidemic countries may shift their focus on the potential association among symptoms and the high synergy risk." Flu remains elevated in the Northern Hemisphere News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Influenza, General Flu activity remains elevated in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere, though detections have declined at the global level, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest update, which roughly covers the last week of January and the first days of February. NIAID/Flickr cc Hot spots include parts of Europe and Central Asia, with very high activity reported from Russia and Slovakia. The 2009 H1N1 virus is dominant, and hospitalizations are elevated but stable. In North America, flu levels are still elevated, with slight influenza B rises in the United States and Canada. China's flu activity is elevated but declining in both the northern and southern provinces, with most detections involving influenza B. Hong Kong's flu hospitalizations are still above the seasonal threshold. Upward trend in South East Asia South East Asia's flu activity showed an overall increase, especially in Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. In Western Asia, flu activity rose in Armenia, Georgia, Israel, and Turkey. Flu remained stable in parts of tropical Asia, but with rises in the Maldives and Nepal. In Africa, flu detections rose in some western nations, including Mauritania and Niger, and rose slightly in Cameroon. Globally, of respiratory samples that were positive for flu at national flu labs during the reporting period, 78.9% were influenza A, and of subtyped influenza A viruses, 54.8% were H3N2. All influenza B viruses belonged to the Victoria lineage. Study finds antibiotics prescribed by VA dentists 'commonly unnecessary' News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship IPGGutenbergUKLtd / iStock More than half of the antibiotics prescribed by dentists practicing in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in 2019 do not have guidelines supporting their use and were likely unnecessary, researchers reported today in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology. Using 2019 VA national electronic health record data, a team of VA researchers evaluated antibiotics prescribed by dentists for appropriateness using two definitions: a guideline-based definition (labeled as "consensus") consistent with American Dental Association Guidelines for Dental Pain and Swelling and American Heart Association Guidelines for the Prevention of Infective Endocarditis and an evidence-based definition (labeled as "non-consensus"). Inappropriate prescriptions, excessive duration A total of 92,224 antibiotic prescriptions were associated with 88,539 dental visits. Most study participants were White (67.8%) and male (90.6%), and 53.9% were medically compromised. Amoxicillin (57.8%) and clindamycin (11.2%) were the most prescribed antibiotics. More than half of the prescriptions were used to prevent complications in medically compromised patients (30.9%) or to prevent post-surgical complications (20.1%), areas that lack professional guidance, the authors note. Of the antibiotics prescribed, 17.5% were considered concordant based on the consensus definition and 64.3% were considered non-consensus concordant. Patient-specific factors that predicted receipt of inappropriate antibiotics were African American race, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander race, and Hispanic ethnicity. The study also found that the average duration for antibiotics prescribed—8.3 days—was excessive. "Regardless of definition applied, antibiotics prescribed by dentists were commonly unnecessary," the study authors wrote. "Improving prescribing by dentists is critical to reach the national goal to decrease unnecessary antibiotic use." Site in India receives responsible antibiotic manufacturing certification News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Pharmaceutical company Viatris announced today that its manufacturing site in India has received Minimized Risk of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) certification. The certification, developed by the British Standards Institution (BSI) in collaboration with the AMR Industry Alliance, provides third-party, independent verification that the antibiotic waste released into the environment by antibiotic manufacturing sites is below a threshold that could promote AMR in the environment. That threshold was established in responsible manufacturing guidelines developed by BSI and the AMR Industry Alliance in 2022 to encourage sustainable production of antibiotics. The certification scheme is targeting key antibiotic supply chain markets like India and China. According to a CIDRAP-ASP report, approximately 20,000 tons of pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, are produced at active pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in India, which are largely unregulated. Researchers have found high levels of antibiotics and multidrug-resistant bacteria in waters near some of those sites, raising concern about the environmental risks posed by antibiotic manufacturing. The Viatris facility is in Aurangabad, India. "We are proud to be the first pharmaceutical site in India to achieve this important Minimized Risk of Antimicrobial Resistance certification from BSI, demonstrating our commitment to controlling antibiotic discharge," Viatris Chief Operations Officer Sanjeev Sethi said in a company press release. Study suggests pandemic employment drop for US nurses was transitory News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Visivasnc / iStock A new study in JAMA Health Forum of national data on US registered nurses (RNs) finds that the rebound in the total size of the RN workforce during 2022 and 2023 indicates that RN labor shortages during the first 2 years of the pandemic were likely transitory. In 2021, the US RN workforce decreased by more than 100,000 employees, the largest single-year drop in 40 years. But by 2022, increases in RN hiring had picked up across the country. To assess if pandemic trends were lasting or an anomaly, researchers used data from the US Bureau of the Census Current Population Survey, including employed RNs aged 23 to 69 years from 1982 through 2023. They paired those data with a retrospective cohort analysis of employment trends by birth year and age to project the age distribution and employment of RNs through 2035. Included in the survey were 455,085 RNs ages 23 to 69. The authors found that the total number of full-time RNs in 2022 and 2023—3.35 million—was actually 6% higher than in 2019 (3.16 million). Workforce expected to grow to 4.5 million by 2035 Using projections based on enrollment in nursing programs and jobs data, the authors estimate that by 2035, the RN workforce will grow by 1.2 million full-time employees to 4.5 million, which matches prepandemic forecasts. RNs ages 35 to 49 will make up nearly half of the workforce (47%) in 2035. In 2022, those RNs accounted for 38% of the workforce. "This forecast suggests that the pandemic's impact on employed RNs, at least thus far, is unlikely to have a significant impact on the future growth of the overall RN workforce," the authors said. This forecast suggests that the pandemic's impact on employed RNs, at least thus far, is unlikely to have a significant impact on the future growth of the overall RN workforce. The authors did note, however, that RN employment in hospital settings is shifting, and may add to the perception of staffing shortages. "Workforce growth from 2018 to 2023 occurred almost entirely in nonhospital settings and may reflect a shift of RN employment away from hospitals and into ambulatory and community settings," they wrote. "This shift may help explain why some hospitals have reported shortages of RNs, despite robust growth of the overall workforce in 2022 and 2023." Quick takes: Good uptake of RSV vaccines in moms and infants, first avian flu in WV poultry, global COVID News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) COVID-19 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that more than half of US newborns were protected from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) this season by either the new monoclonal antibody preventive nirsemivab (Beyfortus) or maternal RSV immunization with Abrysvo, Axios reported, citing CDC figures. Through January, 40.5% of women with babies ages 8 months and younger said their infants received Beyfortus, and 16.2% of women at 32 or more weeks gestation received Abrysvo. Beyfortus was approved in July 2023, and high demand led to shortages in the fall and winter. In August 2023, Abrysvo was approved for pregnant women as a strategy to protect newborns. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today announced the first detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in West Virginia's poultry, which occurred in a backyard flock in Kanawaha County, which encompasses Charleston, the state's capital. The state's agriculture department said the poultry owner contacted authorities following the rapid onset of illness and death in the multispecies flock. It said the virus had previously been detected twice before in wild birds. The outbreaks, which began in 2022, have now affected poultry in 48 states. Though few countries regularly test for COVID-19 and report their data, the World Health Organization (WHO) continues to report monthly trends, and for January, cases declined 58% compared to the previous month, while deaths declined 38%. Even fewer countries regularly report hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions for COVID, and those markers also declined in January. The JN.1 variant remains the dominant strain—accounting for 88% of sequences—and is the only variant showing a continued increase.

"We're going to do a full release on the census count for 2023 in the coming weeks however numbers appear to have not recovered following avian bird flu," he said. He added: "We wouldn't have expected the numbers to recover in a year so these figures aren't a surprise".The sea birds retuned to Alderney for breeding earlier than expected this year on 11 February. Tara Cox from the Alderney Wildlife Trust said it "varies year on year, but generally it's anywhere up to 16 February".The majority of Alderney's gannets spend their winter months off the coast of North Africa.Mrs Cox said seeing the birds return to the islands off Alderney was "quite a fantastic sight". Alderney Wildlife Trust monitored the sea birds while they were in the area, including their breeding behaviour. A webcam to view the gannets should be available on the trust's website from the end of February. Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

Your risk of having a heart attack is six times higher in the week after a bout of the flu. Viruses like influenza ‘the flu’ can cause an inflammatory response in your body, placing strain on your heart; this could lead to heart failure or an abnormal heartbeat. The flu can also destabilise plaque in your blood vessels, and this can cause a blockage and possible heart attack.The flu vaccine helps to prevent the flu and protect your heart.Since the COVID-19 pandemic flu cases are on the rise, making it even more important to get the flu vaccine.To help look after your heart, you should get the vaccine before the flu season starts to peak in June. How do I get my flu vaccine? People with heart disease, people 65 years and over and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are among those eligible to receive a free flu shot every year under the National Immunisation Program.Note that your healthcare provider may charge a consultation fee for the visit. You can check this when you make your appointment.Call your doctor or pharmacist to book in your flu vaccine today.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Melissa Phillip-Houston Chronicle via APMelissa Phillip/The Associated PressShareBookmarkPlease log in to bookmark this story.Log InCreate Free AccountThe fall COVID-19 vaccine cut the risk of COVID-19 illness by about half overall, and by 67 per cent for those with a previous infection, according to new research from the Canadian network that has long tracked the performance of the annual flu shot.This is the first time the Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network, which is comprised of hundreds of primary care providers in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, produced mid-season estimates of the effectiveness of immunization against COVID-19.For people with hybrid immunity against COVID-19 – meaning they’ve had a jab and an infection – the shot targeting the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant performed slightly better against COVID-19 than the flu shot did against influenza.The network estimated the influenza vaccine was 63 per cent effective against influenza A(H1N1), the dominant strain this season, and 40 per cent effective against the A(H3N2) subtype. That’s a “decent” mark by historical standards, said Danuta Skowronski, a physician epidemiologist with the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control and leader of the network’s research.By comparison, in 2019-20, the last winter before the pandemic, the flu shot was estimated by the end of the season to have been 43 per cent effective against A(H1N1), 50 per cent effective against A(H3N2) and 65 per cent effective against influenza B. H1N1 was the most common strain that winter.“Over all, the message is there’s good protection for those who received the autumn 2023-2024 influenza vaccine,” Dr. Skowronski said.The Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network’s decision to track the effectiveness of both shots in tandem is another sign that physicians and epidemiologists are treating SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as a regular feature of winter virus season.“Both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are highly changeable viruses. They’re unique in that way, compared to other vaccine-preventable diseases,” Dr. Skowronski said. The network’s leaders felt a duty to gauge the effectiveness of both vaccines, given that public-health officials urged Canadians to receive them at the same time, she added.The network’s leaders measure flu shot effectiveness by having several hundred family doctors and nurse practitioners in Canada’s four largest provinces test patients who come in with flu-like symptoms to determine if they have a lab-confirmed case of influenza. Researchers then look to see what share of each group – positive or negative for flu – was vaccinated, and compare the results to estimate vaccine effectiveness. The network used the same method to judge the COVID-19 shot.The surveillance effort doesn’t capture mild cases of either virus that don’t require medical attention, nor does it measure how well the shots perform against severe illness that puts people to hospital.The Canadian network’s estimates of flu shot effectiveness jibe with those published earlier in the season in Alberta, where researchers were able to link data on immunizations, lab tests for influenza, and visits to clinics and hospitals to produce estimates of flu-shot effectiveness in near real time.That group estimated the flu shot in Alberta to be 61 per cent effective against the widely circulating A(H1N1), 49 per cent effective against the less-common A(H3N2) and 75 per cent effective against influenza B, which typically peaks later in the season.Real-time estimates are useful because “there’s a lot of people who are just not sold on flu shots,” said Jeff Kwong, associate director of the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto. He is one of the authors of a study based on the Alberta data.Dr. Kwong hopes more people will get the flu shot if they hear early in the season that it provides solid protection. In seasons like 2014-15, when the overall effectiveness of the shot was an abysmal 9 per cent, early data would allow hospitals and public health to prepare, he added.The 2023-24 influenza season has unfolded more typically than any season since COVID-19 struck, said Allison McGeer, an infectious disease consultant at Toronto’s Mount Sinai Hospital. “On balance, it’s doing what you would expect it to do, which is getting back to normal postpandemic.”Last season, pediatric hospitals were overwhelmed as several viruses rebounded after COVID-19-control measures were lifted. In the fall and winter of 2022-23, there were 2,444 hospital admissions linked to influenza for children younger than 4, up from 33 such admissions the season before, according to a report the Canadian Institute for Health Information released Thursday. That figure was a return to prepandemic levels.The institute also found that, among children younger than 4, hospital admissions doubled for lower respiratory infections last season, while hospital stays for COVID-19 reached 3,310, a 43-per-cent increase over the season before.Editor’s note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the fall COVID-19 vaccine cut the risk of COVID-19 illness by half for people who had not caught the virus before.

Update, February 2024 – Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) continues to affect the wildlife on the subantarctic islands of South Georgia. The latest results from samples taken from the islands reveal that the disease has now been detected in the wandering albatross (as at 9 February 2024). Avian Influenza was first detected in the brown skua populations in October 2023, closely followed by kelp gulls. In January 2024, it was discovered as being present in elephant and fur seal populations. Whilst no penguins on the islands have yet tested positive for the disease, it has been detected in one bird on the nearby Falkland Islands. The team at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), at Cambridge and on the islands, are working closely with the Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) who govern the territory. Recent samples were collected on the islands and tested in Weybridge, UK. Results show positive results for HPAI H5N1 in albatrosses, elephant seals, fur seals, brown skuas, kelp gulls and Antarctic terns. Wandering albatross have tested positive for avian flu on Bird Island (Photo: Richard Phillips, BAS) BAS operates two research stations on South Georgia: King Edward Point and Bird Island. As a result of the confirmed cases of HPAI, fieldwork involving close contact with impacted species has been suspended. BAS staff continue to follow strict GSGSSI biosecurity measures adopted this season of enhanced cleaning of clothing and field equipment when moving between sites with high densities of wildlife, as well as remaining vigilant for signs of disease. Ash Bennison is the science manager for Bird Island Research Station, operated by BAS. He says: “It’s incredibly sad to witness the effects of avian flu on the animal populations we study on South Georgia. We are doing everything we can to mitigate the effects of this disease and are working closely with GSGSSI to continue our work to monitor and conserve these amazing species.” Elements of the wider science programme at King Edward Point and Bird Island continue under caution, including long-term monitoring of wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, grey-headed albatross, northern and southern giant petrels, gentoo penguins and macaroni penguins.

(Photographer: Pete Bucktrout, Season: 2008/2009) South Georgia has some of the most closely monitored seabird colonies in the world, equipping scientists and conservationists with indicators of change for species. BAS and GSGSSI are working closely with DEFRA’s Animal Plant Health Agency (APHA) to monitor and control the spread of the disease and to mitigate its impact on the region’s wildlife. Laura Sinclair Willis, Chief Executive, Government of South Georgia & the South Sandwich Islands, says: “The Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands anticipated that High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza would likely arrive on our shores in the 23/24 austral summer, and we are grateful for the ongoing support of the Animal and Plant Health Agency, British Antarctic Survey, Ministry of Defence and the Antarctic cruise industry, along with a global community of partners and stakeholders who are helping us to monitor the impacts within the Territory. “The transmission and spread of this disease is primarily a natural phenomenon, and we continue to emphasise the importance of scrupulous biosecurity by all those entering South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.” Press Office Contact the Press Office Share this Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on Twitter See alsoBird Island Research Station (Facility)Ecosystems team (Team)Ecology & biodiversity (Research topic)Science (Discover section)You may also like British Antarctic Survey (BAS) is a component of the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).

Laboratory tests by the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal confirmed that it was caused by the type A strain of the H5N1 variant of the avian influenza virus. The bird flu cases were discovered in the villages of Chatagutla in Podalakur and Gummaladibba in Kovur district sub-divisions after several chicken deaths were reported on poultry farms. The disease did not emerge in commercial operations but was found in backyard poultry farms.Hundreds of birds and eggs were culled on February 17, 2024 as per policy. A three-day ban was imposed on shops selling chicken within a 10-kilometre radius of the epicentre and a three-month ban on shops within a 1-km radius. Read more: Bird flu decimates seabird populations in UK over two yearsThe poultry likely caught the virus from migratory birds in Pulicat lake in nearby Tirupati district, according to officials. Migratory wild aquatic birds, particularly waterfowl, are the primary natural reservoirs for most subtypes of influenza A viruses, infecting poultry and other bird or animal species, according to the World Health Organization for Animal Health.The virus is endemic in poultry populations in Asia, Europe and Africa. Rare cases of avian influenza with type A (H5N1) viruses have been identified in humans across Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe. In 1997, an outbreak of human infections with the same strain was found in Hong Kong, China. Since 2003, 868 human cases and 457 deaths have occurred globally, indicating a 52 per cent death rate, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The emergence of influenza A viruses with the ability to infect people could potentially lead to a pandemic when the virus mutates to sustain human-to-human transmission that evades immunity, according to the global health body. How and when it will spread will be difficult to predict, WHO added.Read more: First penguin deaths in sub-Antarctic region attributed to bird flu strainA recent study published in the latest edition of the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases said the avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 has already been in a significant panzootic phase between 2020 and 2023, the equivalent of a pandemic in the animal kingdom. The researchers reviewed information on infected mammals from 59 scientific articles published between 2020–2023 and between 2003-2019, across two periods of infectionsThe paper underscored the risk that mammalian adaptation could pose for human health, emphasising that information is scarce on the current panzootic (2020-2023) event.The virus that originally infected birds crossed over to several mammal species in 2003, affecting tigers, leopards, lions, pigs, minks, donkeys, foxes, domestic dogs and cats, bears and seals. Since 2020, the number of infected species has increased and has affected more than 48 mammal species, substantially larger than previous waves. It is therefore of some conservation concern, however, large populations of animals have so far not been identified. The paper highlighted the incident of 20,000 South American sea lions who suddenly died, with several testing positive for H5N1, underlining the potential effect of this virus on some threatened mammal populations. Read more: We should only worry about bird flu making us sick when we see human-to-human transmissionIn the current period of infection (2020-2023), excluding humans, mammals in 26 countries have been infected by this virus: Europe (17 countries), South America (5 countries), North America (2 countries), and Asia (2 countries). The new geographic areas identified were Peru, Chile, and Argentina, where 13 marine mammal species, up to thousands, reported deaths.Mutations to increase human spilloverThere is no evidence of human-to-human transmission, however, mutations of the H5N1 virus could increase the risk of a pandemic, the paper warns. A case in point is the Spanish influenza (1918-1919) pandemic that developed from an avian influenza virus.“For instance, the T271A mutation reported in minks in Spain is also present in the H1N1 that produced a pandemic in 2009. Similarly, the PB2-E627K mutation found in this virus in diverse geographic areas could indicate an adaptation for replication in mammals,” the report said. “Mutations and infections with H5N1 in potential mixing-vessel species (for example, minks and wild and domestic pigs) should be followed closely because of the potential risk to human health,” the report added.Read more: French bird flu vaccine for ducks may be launched soonSince 2018, the WHO has been bracing itself for a pandemic from an unknown illness termed “Disease X”. The unknown set of pathogens from which Disease X can emerge is large and beyond the influenza virus, but the origin is likely going to be zoonotic, according to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.It could be arising right now, from any part of the world, according to scientists. “There could be the first jumps of a virus into a human population somewhere and maybe 90 per cent of the people who get it have a common cold like illness, or what appears to be garden variety pneumonia, and nobody tests for that.” Amesh Adalja, MD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said in an interview.

Photograph by Sean Weaver / Instagram Share When Nate Phinney packed up his ice fishing gear in Watertown, South Dakota and set out for a nearby lake on Feb. 9, he wasn’t expecting the scene he found when he arrived — some 1,000 to 1,500 dead snow geese piled up and frozen into the lake’s surface. The carnage that he filmed at the scene was jarring enough to amass millions of views on social media. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sean Weaver (@seanweaverdwc) Phinney has been fishing and hunting in this area for years, and the sight of dead birds frozen into the water wasn’t exactly a new one, he tells Outdoor Life. “Usually, those geese would be spread out all over the lake, and you wouldn’t see them until spring because they’d be covered up by snow,” Phinney says, explaining that die-offs from avian influenza during recent migrations have left lots of dead geese scattered across the state. “Except we don’t have any snow this year, and the lakes sort of thawed back out in early December, so you get that effect of windrows of dead geese on one side of the lake. It’s kind of a shock.” Phinney is friends with waterfowler Sean Weaver, whose over 44,000 Instagram followers were equally shocked by the video when Weaver posted the footage to his Instagram account. The video has since racked up 2.4 million views. Weaver witnessed similar scenes back in early December when the migration came through eastern South Dakota, he tells Outdoor Life. As he explains in the caption of Phinney’s video, these birds — mostly juvenile snows — probably died around December and have been stuck in the ice for months. That hypothesis is supported by the fact that South Dakota lakes have been mostly frozen since then and the bulk of the northward spring migration hasn’t reached the area yet. “This is just one lake that went through a die-off on a roost in December,” Weaver says. “I recorded several lakes in early December with huge die-offs like this. This is not an isolated incident. There were dozens, if not hundreds, of lakes in eastern South Dakota that had dead snow geese on them in early December.” The new strain of avian influenza, which has wreaked havoc on wild bird populations, domestic poultry, and even trickled into mammal species, remains “uncharted territory,” according to Weaver. That’s because no one really understands the breadth of avian influenza’s impact on wild bird populations yet — especially because the death toll is constantly rising. “When we’ve had bird die-offs in the past from cholera or botulism, they’re these isolated spots and isolated incidents. It’s not continent-wide die-offs of snow geese,” Weaver says. “Avian influenza has been running through the wild population for two years now. It has always been endemic to wild birds but it’s never been deadly to wild birds, at least nowhere near this capacity. We don’t know what the ramifications of something like this will be with bird populations, and frankly, no one has ever tackled quantifying and calculating it.” Read Next: We’re Experiencing the Deadliest Bird Flu Outbreak in History. Here’s What All Bird Hunters Need to Know Despite the lack of grasp on the lasting impacts of avian influenza on continent-wide waterfowl numbers, the immediate impact is glaringly obvious to any waterfowl hunter, bird watcher, ice angler, or passerby who takes a closer look at what’s frozen into the lake’s surface. It’s not a pretty sight. “That’s the most dead snow geese I have ever seen,” Phinney says. “To see that many dead birds in one scene and knowing that’s mostly from disease, it’s eye-opening.” Goose Hunting Hunting Waterfowl Hunting Summary Avian influenza has struck wild bird populations across the continent. One video showing the disease's grim consequences has gone viral.

Hopefully, we stay below that level. But it is for sure the worst flu season we’ve had at least since COVID,” said Jacob Schafer, Infection Control Director, Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center.The good news — cases are not as severe as earlier this year.As of last week, DOH says flu cases made up 1.8% of ER visits — a steep drop from 4.2% in early January.“Every flu season, there’s a combination of A and B circulating, usually we see A first then there’s a peak of B. Right now both are circulating, that could be one of the reasons for the high numbers,” Schafer said.And don’t be surprised if you or someone you know got the flu vaccine and still got sick — doctors say it could have been worse.“All of these vaccines are meant to reduce the most severe disease and prevent hospitalizations and death,” said Dr. Lee Buenconsejo-Lum, interim dean of the John A. Burns School of Medicine. “You’ll feel pretty bad, but you’re not in the hospital. Right. So that, so that means actually, the vaccine has worked.”The CDC says this year’s flu shot is about 50% effective — considered good when viruses are constantly changing.“The flu vaccines usually either have three or four types of influenza. Now, these are not the live virus, these are just the proteins and the outside but it’s, you know, meant to to make, like a protective response,” said Dr. Buenconsejo-Lum.If you do feel symptoms, stay away from healthy people, rest, drink plenty of water, take medications for relief, and see your doctor.Pediatrician Gary Dela Cruz says testing his patients for flu, COVID and strep helps him provide better care.He’s also giving out a lot of flu shots — with spring break travel and gatherings around the corner.“We still see flu cases into like spring so it’s still gonna happen. I think it will still continue onward for at least the beginning half of the year,” Dela Cruz said.While COVID restrictions are gone, experts say it’s a good idea to keep practicing good hand washing, mask wearing and disinfecting surfaces to protect yourself and your loved ones.Copyright 2024 Hawaii News Now.

MANCHESTER — The Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife announced on Friday that a deceased bobcat and two red-tailed hawks in Cornwall – less than 90 minutes from Manchester Center – tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only some strains of avian influenza are considered “highly pathogenic,” marked by severe disease and high mortality in infected poultry.The lab results showing HPAI were delivered to the Department of Fish and Wildlife on Thursday, Feb. 15. The Department is now anticipating the results of a second test to confirm the results, which could take “several weeks.”“Our recommendations to Vermonters are the same as they’ve been since HPAI was first detected in our state – mainly, to avoid direct contact with wild birds,” said David Sausville, Wildlife Management Program Manager with the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department. “Observe wild birds only from a distance and practice good hygiene around domestic fowl. Practice good biosecurity by keeping domestic fowl and other pets away from areas where wild birds gather, like bird feeding stations or duck ponds.”Though HPAI has been circulating in the state since 2022, the infected bobcat is the first case of HPAI virus in a mammal from Vermont. Though transmission to mammals is uncommon according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife, other cases have also been reported in multiple states including New York and Connecticut.Within Vermont, HPAI has been detected in both wild and domestic birds over the past two years. As of Monday, Feb. 19 the Department of Fish and Wildlife reported 72 wild birds infected with HPAI in Vermont on its website. Previously infected birds include red tailed hawks like the two found in Cornwall, Canada geese, wood ducks, mallards, black ducks, turkey vultures, and bald eagles. Two outbreaks among domestic fowl have occurred in Caledonia and Lamoille counties, with both flocks being depopulated.Game Warden Kyle Isherwood has served the towns of Manchester, Dorset, Peru, Winhall, Stratton, Weston, Landgrove, Londonderry, Jamaica, Andover, Windham and Townshend for seven years. During this time, Isherwood says that he has submitted avian influenza cases for testing, though none have come back positive.Even with the first mammal fatality in Vermont, Isherwood said that there is no cause for alarm.“Birds have wings and can fly anywhere they want, so I don’t think that this positive case out of Addison County changes much,” he said. “As long as everyone takes some simple precautions, there is a low chance of this affecting humans.”Only two human cases of this strain of HPAI virus have been reported in the U.S. to date, according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife. The most common cause of spread is through infected waterfowl who come in contact with domestic birds either directly or via droppings.Though the return of hunting and hiking seasons promises to put more people in contact with wildlife, Isherwood says he is not concerned about spread stemming from recreational activities.“It puts more people in the woods, which means more eyes for the biologists and I,” he said.Risk factors for avian influenza include housing birds outside, having ponds or other bodies of water that attract waterfowl on the property, piling debris near bird housing, introduction of new birds without quarantine, and lack of protective equipment and sharing of equipment between farms.Further guidance for farmers can be found on Vermont.gov's Agency of Agriculture food and markets page.As Vermont is currently in the midst of bird feeder season – typically from December to April, to avoid bear activity – Isherwood encourages anyone with a bird feeder to clean it regularly and to report any suspicious deaths.“If a songbird is found dead near a feeder, that’s not necessarily a red flag,” Isherwood said, “but if five are found, that’s something that should be tested.”The following should be reported when observed: hawks or owls found sick or dead away from roads (where vehicles are the likeliest cause of death), any loons or eagles found sick or dead, more than two terns found sick or dead, and three or more wild turkeys found sick or dead at the same location. Any sightings of more than five dead or sick crows, ravens, jays or songbirds should also be reported.Dead birds should never be handled, he explains. Any suspected cases should instead be reported with their location directly to Isherwood at 802-279-8935 or to the Department of Fish and Wildlife at fwinformation@vermont.gov or 802-828-1000.

Trends of the week COVID-19: Decrease in the number of cases and the positivity rate of COVID-19. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV): Decrease in the number of RSV cases. Influenza: Decrease in the number of influenza cases. COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 From 12 to 18 February 2024 (week 7), the number of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 dropped to 56 cases, compared to 109 cases the previous week (-49%). The positivity rate fell to 3.3% compared to 4.8% the previous week. The viral concentration detected in wastewater is decreasing[1]. These indicators suggest that the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has decreased. The latest sequencing data available show a preponderance of the JN.1 variant (86.7%) followed by the BA.2.86 variant (11.1%). [2] Influenza For the week of 12 to 18 February 2024 (week 7), the number of influenza cases reported by laboratories decreased to 455 cases from 861 cases in the previous week, a decrease of 47% compared to the previous week. These data largely coincide with LNS sentinel surveillance, which indicates high circulation of the influenza virus [2]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) For the week of 12 to 18 February 2024 (week 7), the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive individuals reported by laboratories dropped to 9 cases, compared with 18 the previous week, presenting an decrease of 50%. The peak of the epidemic this season was reached in week 50, from 11 to 17 December 2023.

There has been a drop in chicken sales due to the bird flu scare in the last two days, according to traders. | Photo Credit: G.N. Rao Officials sounded an alert over the presence of Avian Influenza A(H5N1), also known as bird flu, in Nellore district.The Veterinary Department, who confirmed the outbreak of bird flu in poultry farms, observed that many chickens have died of the flu. The poultry owners culled hundreds of birds to prevent the spread of the Avian Influenza A(H5N1).The State government has formed special teams and issued instructions to officers concerned to take stringent measures to prevent the spread of bird flu.Rapid response teamsIn all 721 rapid response teams have been constituted across the State, and instructions have been given to collect samples and create awareness among the poultry farmers on the disease.The teams will cover all villages where poultry farms are located as part of their survey on bird flu.“Except Nellore district, there have been no reports of bird flu from other districts in the State. There is no need for any panic,” said a veterinary doctor.Meanwhile, there was a drop in sales of chicken on Sunday in the wake of the bird flu scare.“After reports of chickens succumbing to bird flu, many people have stopped eating chicken. Sales have remained low after the outbreak of the disease,” a trader named Venkanna from Vijayawada said.“Poultry owners were asked not to dispose of dead birds in canals, fields, and in open places, and were asked to alert the officers concerned,” said Rama Krishna, a resident of Undi in West Godavari district.“We collected random samples from the poultries in Krishna, East Godavari, NTR District, West Godavari, Konaseema and other districts and the results came back negative,” said a veterinary officer.“With the outbreak of Avian Influenza A(H5N1) in Nellore, we have not been eating chicken for the last two days,” said a woman named Prameela of Gudivada.

Sarah Pruys/Cabin Radio Share Numbers of influenza B and RSV cases are steadily increasing in the Beaufort Delta region, the NWT’s chief public health officer said on Friday. At the start of January, the territory’s public health professionals had warned that a wave of influenza B was likely to follow the influenza A cases that made the winter feel like a particularly severe season. Since Inuvik’s first influenza B case was reported on January 4, Dr Kami Kandola’s office wrote on Friday, “increased cases of influenza B and an uptick in RSV cases have been seen in many of the communities of the Beaufort Delta region.” Over the past week, the advisory continued, 15 of the 17 confirmed influenza B cases reported in the NWT have occurred in the Beaufort Delta, as have the majority of recent RSV cases. “Vaccination and staying home if you are sick are the best measures to prevent spread of disease. As we enter March spring break, we anticipate an influx of travellers and visitors, therefore it is important that the public (six months of age and older) be up to date on their vaccines,” Kandola’s office wrote.

According to the Guardian, there is no evidence of it having passed from human to human, only from birds to humans, but it is significant enough to have been reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO).Speaking to the Guardian, Dr Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said there were no signs of H5N8 having passed between the workers, “only time will tell how soon future mutations will allow it to overcome this barrier”.Dr Michael Greger in a podcast with Surge co-director Ed Winters warned that avian influenza had the potential to be many times more transmissible and deadly than coronaviruses such as those that caused Covid-19, SARS and MERS. “The last time a bird flu jumped species and spread easily from human to human, it triggered the deadliest plague in history, the 1918 flu pandemic that killed 50 million people,” said Dr Greger writing for Surge. “Evidence now suggests that all pandemic influenza viruses - in fact, all human and mammalian flu viruses in general - owe their origins to avian influenza, and we now have bird flu viruses like H5N1 and H7N9 poised to kill millions around the world should they lock in the necessary mutations to spread easily from human to human.Now we can add H5N8 to the list of strains of influenza on the cusp of mutating to become transmissible between humans. While the workers infected in Russia reportedly now feel well with no further developments, there is little way of knowing how H5N8 or any novel strain of bird flu would affect populations including the young, elderly and vulnerable persons with underlying health issues.Farming is central to the threat posed by future pandemics, with all the major outbreaks of modern times tracing their zoonotic origins back to human exploitation of animals, as we revealed in our Covid-19 and animal exploitation: preventing the next global pandemic white paper. Flu viruses are particularly predisposed to mutations, more so than coronaviruses and other types of virus, and farms provide the perfect unsanitary melting pot for human, swine and avian influenza viruses to mix and produce novel zoonoses. Factory farms in particular recreate the ‘trench conditions’ of the First World War that gave rise to the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed millions across the world. “There will be more pandemics, and there is a feeling among some scientists that this could just be a dress rehearsal for the real big pandemic.” Speaking to the Independent last month, Professor Aliza le Roux, associate professor of zoology at the University of the Free State, said: “Our demand for meat is driving cheaper and less controlled agricultural practices, cramming more animals into smaller spaces, feeding them less and less natural fodder.”Professor Robert Bragg, from the UFS’ department of microbial, biochemical and food biotechnology, said: “There will be more pandemics, and there is a feeling among some scientists that this could just be a dress rehearsal for the real big pandemic.”To think that Covid-19 could one day pale in comparison to an avian flu pandemic and that one could emerge at any time from any number of strains already detected at farms across the world is terrifying. Closer to home, H5N8, the same subtype that infected the Russian workers, has been detected at a farm in North Yorkshire, UK, resulting in the culling of an entire flock of chickens; while H5N1 has been confirmed in Scotland. When any one of these mutates and runs rampant among human populations, we’ll look back and miss the days of Covid lockdowns and point the finger at politicians for ignoring the many warning signs and the recommendations from the CDC, WHO, FAO and other leading health experts. But the blame can’t only be on governments when it is us, the everyday consumer, who chooses to turn a blind eye all so that we can return to the status quo, whatever that means.It is down to all of us to demand a shift away from animal agriculture and towards plant-based alternatives for food production, where the conditions for new zoonotic diseases to emerge are virtually non-existent. So if you read with excitement the news that music festivals will be back on for the summer and you’re already planning your first night out with your friends, don’t count on it lasting for very long if you insist on supporting the exploitation of animals on vast scales. When people around you are dying from bird flu, will you only then put down the chicken burger and realise the part you played? Andrew Gough is Media and Investigations Manager at Surge.

The birds were sent for testing at the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative after each were found dead last week, and all three tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, the cooperative confirmed this week.Kingston has been dealing with an ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H5N1 in geese, with dozen of the birds turning up dead along the shoreline at Lake Ontario Park since the start of the month.Leah Birmingham, medical director at Sandy Pines Wildlife Centre says it’s not surprising to now see HPAI showing up in scavenger species.“That’s pretty common, ” she said when reached by phone earlier this week. “If an animal of any sort dies from a disease and that disease is transmissible to the animal that eats it, then there’s a good chance that animal’s going to end up with it as well.” Story continues below advertisement Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Public Health says 12 birds including eight geese, one eagle, and three crows have tested positive for avian influenza between Feb. 7 and 21.

The local deaths are part of a global avian influenza outbreak that’s killed millions of birds across the country in the past five months, according to recent numbers from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.So far this year, more than 200 Canada geese as well as gulls, crows and a Bald Eagle have been found sick or dead from HPAI in southern Ontario, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC).

These typically cause cold-like symptoms like runny nose, cough, fever, and fatigue. Some may also experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea.Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementA doctor checks a patient using an endoscope amid a surge in seasonal fever cases, at Government ENT Hospital. (Photo: PTI)Daphne ClaranceNew Delhi,UPDATED: Feb 24, 2024 10:22 ISTIn ShortThe months of January to March often see a surge in common cold infectionsWhile some could have common cold-like symptoms, others could get more severe with ear infections, wheezing or pneumoniaChildren become more susceptible to viruses and bacterial infections during seasonal changeThe change of season heralds a surge of cases of flu every year. With people flooding outpatient departments (OPD) for cough, fever, breathlessness and runny nose, doctors suggest taking care of your immunity and masking up to avoid any transfer of infections. The increase in viral infections is commonly attributed to adenovirus, influenza A, RSV, and rhino-enteroviruses. These typically cause cold-like symptoms like runny nose, cough, fever, and fatigue. Some may also experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea. advertisementWhile most cases are uncomplicated, a small percentage can develop complications like ear infections, wheezing, or pneumonia. Dr Monica Mahajan, Medical Director, Max Multi Speciality Hospital, Panchsheel Park, told IndiaToday.In that patients coming to the OPD are typically suffering from viral infections including influenza /H1N1, respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV), Covid-19 and other circulating viruses."This is an anticipated rise with change of weather. Most people will have a body ache, throat pain, runny nose and dry cough. However, the concern arises when severe infections requiring hospitalisation get ignored or neglected as these can prove fatal," said Dr Monica Mahajan.VIRAL INFECTIONS AND ALLERGIESSince winter is waning between January and March, seasonal allergies are also prevalent due to pollen circulation. These allergies can manifest as sneezing, blocked and congested nose, watery eyes, and itchy ears. However, it is important to be able to distinguish between allergies and infections, suggested Dr Mahajan. The temperature difference, nip in the air and the flower pollen cause flare-ups of nose and eye allergies and wheezing in asthma patients. However, there is no fever. People arrive at OPDs amind surge in flu cases. During this seasonal change, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is also witnessed in several patients, which is a more severe infection with high fever, dry or productive cough and shortness of breath. It could be viral or bacterial pneumonia or even both.Sometimes a simple viral sore throat may end up with an added bacterial infection. Children, elderly people, people who have diabetes, and people with heart, liver or kidney complications could experience increased vulnerability to these infections."It is important to consult a doctor to figure out what sort of infection you have. Accordingly, you may be prescribed simple anti-allergies or antiviral, antibiotic medicines. Avoid self-medication and injudicious use of antibiotics," said Dr Mahajan. VIRAL INFECTIONS IN CHILDRENThere are some severe cases of children with asthma, weakened immune systems, or chronic health conditions who can suffer more from contracting the flu virus. Patients in large numbers wait their turn at the OPD of Government ENT Hospital amid a surge in seasonal fever cases. (Photo: PTI) Dr Anupama Menon, Consultant - Pediatric Pulmonologist, Rainbow Children’s Hospital, Marathahalli, Bengaluru, said that during the months between January and March, children are particularly susceptible to contracting viruses and bacteria. “We see many children with viral infections and this is more especially post-Covid due to lowering of their immunity. While it can feel like they're constantly under the weather, this is their immune system building up its defences. The good news is, most of these infections are mild and resolve on their own with plenty of rest at home,” Dr Anupama Menon told IndiaToday.In. TIPS TO KEEP YOURSELF HEALTHYDr Monica Mahajan suggested hydrating the body well, eating healthy food and not to discard your woollens too soon.advertisement"Take influenza and pneumonia vaccines after discussing with your physician. Prevention is always better than cure," she said.Dr Menon added that since children are more susceptible to viruses and bacterial infection during seasonal change, parents should make sure to see how long their child's fever lasts. Hydrate youreslf well, eat healthily and don't stop wearing your woollens too soon. If it's more than two days, show them to the doctor. "If they have difficulty breathing, or show signs of dehydration, seek medical attention immediately. Early diagnosis can help prevent complications,” advised Dr Menon. Dr Rakesh Bilagi, Pulmonologist, Apollo Clinic, Koramangala, Bengaluru, told IndiaToday.In stressed stressing that getting vaccinated is the top priority. "It significantly reduces the risk of contracting influenza and minimises the severity of symptoms if infection does occur," said Dr Rakesh Bilagi. He added that if you're feeling unwell, it's better to stay at home to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses. Cover your mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing, to avoid the spread of infectious material to others. advertisementUsing a humidifier to add moisture to indoor air can alleviate congestion and soothe irritated airways, he added. Dr Brunda Consultant, Internal Medicine, Aster CMI Hospital, shared several measures to keep yourself healthy during this period. Get the flu vaccine every year, especially if you're over 65, pregnant, or have a weakened immune system Wash your hands regularly to prevent germ spread. Do it often, especially before eating or touching your face. Practice good hygiene. When coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth and nose. Avoid close contact with sick people. Eat a balanced diet. A balanced diet boosts immunity. Eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Staying hydrated by drinking fluids can help flush out toxins and maintain good health. Lack of sleep can weaken your immune system, so make sure to get plenty of rest.

The deadly animal disease, avian influenza, has been reportedly discovered in some parts of Kebbi State. The state Director, Veterinary Services, Ministry of Animal Husbandry, Dr Alheri Ibrahim-Sanchi, says the state government has stepped up efforts to mitigate its spread. He made the disclosure on Saturday while addressing journalists shortly after fumigating a farm infected with the disease located at Amanawa village, Kalgo, outskirts of Birnin Kebbi. He said the disease had killed 14 peacocks in the affected facility so far. The fumigation was carried out by a team of professionals under “One Health” comprising experts from ministries of Animal Husbandry, Health, Environment, and Information, as well as Principal Partners. Ibrahim-Sanchi said the essence of the exercise was to curtail the spread. He explained that some peacocks were reported to have been ill, and the pattern of mortality became worrisome, “so we sent a team of veterinary doctors for preliminary investigation. “Upon investigation, we found it necessary to take samples, and those samples were sent to the Veterinary Diagnostic Reference Laboratory in Jos. “When those samples were analysed, unfortunately for us, they returned positive for ‘Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1)’, so, this is what necessitated this exercise, to first of all come to the scene where these birds were resident and do the needful.” Related News Senate approves N24bn refund to Kebbi, Nasarawa for federal airport projects Kebbi plans appeal as court affirms emir’s illegal dethronement Akume unveils N2bn water scheme in Kebbi The director said the main task was to ensure that the incident did not go beyond the affected facility, assuring residents that the team would go ahead and take active surveillance, “which is a pattern of seeking for other likely cases that may be occuring in our state.” He said that considering the fact that “highly pathogenic avian influenza is zoonotic infection that has the tendency to spread to humans”, the team had also undertaken the veterinary component of it, while colleagues in human health would identify individuals in contact with the animals for necessary action. Ibrahim-Sanchi appealed to poultry owners to remain calm but be vigilant and intensify bio-security, adding that “it is a disease that potent high economic loss for poultry owners.” He advised poultry farmers to share information with their colleagues and minimise the number of persons who visit the poultry. The director also enjoined them to restrict the movement of birds and avoid sharing farm implements to curb the spread of the disease. Ibrahim-Sanchi added that the ministry, in collaboration with sister ministries and agencies like the Ministry of Health, Environment and Information, and principal partners, was making efforts to sensitise the public to the disease. Also, in an interview, the Director of Public Health, Kebbi Ministry of Health, Abubakar Bagudu-Muhammad, confirmed that the disease had the potency to affect humans, adding that “it is also pathogenic, meaning it can be transmitted from one person to another.” He, however, said they were working as a team, involving animals, humans, the environment, information, and other stakeholders to coordinate emergency health activities at the Public Health Emergency Operation Centre to curtail any outbreak. Bagudu-Muhammad charged veterinary zonal officers, local government disease surveillance and notification under health, zonal officers of the Ministry of Environment, and focal persons at the ward and community levels to be vigilant and put more attention on the border axis.

Measures are being taken to control the disease, including a temporary ban on rearing poultry and strict biosecurity protocols in poultry farms. Vaccination of poultry is also being carried out. Symptoms in humans can range from mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and, in some cases, death. Local avian influenza outbreak in two villages in Nellore district in Andhra Pradesh has come to the fore. "Police personnel closed chicken shops in a three-km radius of the 10-km surveillance area for three days in these two epicentres. We are taking all measures to control the disease," Nellore district Animal Husbandry joint director B Maheshwarudu told news agency PTI. He noted that there is a temporary ban on rearing poultry in these two epicentres for three months and subsequently they will be allowed in smaller numbers of 10 or 20 birds.What is avian influenza or bird flu?Avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is a viral infection that primarily affects birds but can occasionally spread to humans and other animals.It is caused by influenza viruses that naturally occur in wild birds. Transmission to humans typically occurs through direct contact with infected birds or their droppings, though rare instances of human-to-human transmission have occurred. Symptoms in humans can range from mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and, in some cases, death. Prevention efforts include strict biosecurity measures in poultry farms, surveillance of wild bird populations, and vaccination of poultry workers in high-risk areas to minimize the spread of the virus.Avian influenza virus H5N1H5N1 virus was identified in Chatagutla and Gummaladibba on February 7. H5N1 is a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza virus that poses a significant threat to both animal and human health. It primarily affects birds, causing severe illness and high mortality rates in poultry populations. In humans, H5N1 infection is rare but can lead to severe respiratory illness, with a high risk of complications and death. Transmission typically occurs through direct contact with infected birds or their environments.Key symptoms to pay attention toAvian influenza symptoms in humans may include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure can occur, leading to hospitalization or death. Direct contact with infected birds or their environments, such as handling sick or dead birds, is the primary mode of transmission. Early recognition of symptoms and prompt medical care are crucial for managing avian influenza infections and preventing complications.Preventive measuresPreventive measures for bird flu include strict biosecurity protocols in poultry farms, such as controlling access to facilities, disinfecting equipment, and limiting contact with wild birds. Regular surveillance of poultry populations is essential to detect and contain outbreaks promptly. Vaccination of poultry against avian influenza viruses can help reduce transmission and minimize the risk of infection. Additionally, educating poultry workers and the public about the importance of proper hygiene, including handwashing and avoiding contact with sick birds, is crucial for preventing the spread of bird flu to humans.Breast Cancer: Early signs of the disease one must never ignoreEnd of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories PreviousDazzling snaps of Manasi ParekhEntertainmentVocabulary test: Do you know what these Shakespearean words mean?Lifestyleâ10 most unique frog species found across the worldLifestyle8 tips to attract chirping birds and parrots to your gardenLifestyleWeight loss: How to make gluten-free Ragi Jaggery CookiesFood7 historical places to explore in GujarattravelRashmika Mandanna exudes festive fashion goals in a red embellished anarkaliEntertainment9 tiny animals in the world and how they surviveLifestyleKeerthy Sureshâs Radiant Festive StyleEntertainment Next123 Photostories Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showSchengen visa denials: 5 countries with the highest rejection ratesFrom getting kicked out from Shark Tank India 4 to marrying a Mexico-based model, buying Indiaâs first : Times when Deepinder Goyal made headlines5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the world8 animals that help Earth heal and howâBigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8â10 most powerful countries in the world in 2024Top 5 Zodiac Sign Ghosts The MostFrom keeping his second marriage under wraps to converting to Islam; A look at Bigg Boss 18 contestant Vivian Dsena's Personal Life revelationsTop 10 Largest Economies In The World 2025: India To Become 4th Largest Economy Soon!

A woman can be seen sneezing. — PexelsThe concerned government authorities including the district health departments and the public sector hospitals in the region, however, have not been giving due attention to the problem, nor preparing the data regarding the number of patients and suspects of the disease being reported in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Many health experts say that it is the most appropriate time for the high risk population including elderly, pregnant women, patients with heart and lung disease and diabetics to take precautionary measures to safeguard them from influenza A infection that can cause major outbreaks and severe disease.Data collected by ‘The News’ has revealed that both the private and the public sector healthcare facilities are receiving a good number of patients with influenza A infection while many are being suspected to have contracted influenza A H3N2 virus. It is important that seasonal ‘influenza A’ disease appears in winter every year in the months of December to February. It may assume the epidemic forms and cause considerable morbidity and mortality.Experts say that by creating awareness among the public about various aspects of influenza A infection, its spread can be controlled and losses can be minimized. Influenza A virus causes the flu, a highly contagious respiratory illness. Different subtypes or strains of influenza A cause outbreaks and serious illnesses.Studies reveal that influenza A infection can cause serious complications including pneumonia, breathing problems and even death particularly in the high risk groups. The disease has caused considerable morbidity and mortality in the last two decades or so. It was the influenza A H1N1 that had affected thousands of people globally in 2009. The same infection, now known as seasonal flu, has become a regular feature appearing each year for the last many years since 2011 in Pakistan and it has claimed hundreds of lives in the past years.Influenza A infection may cause mild, moderate or severe illness. Serious outcomes of flu infection can result in hospitalization or death. Elderly people aged 65 years or above, pregnant women, younger children of less than two years of age, and people with certain health conditions, are at higher risk of serious flu complications.It is important that nearly 90 per cent of all influenza A patients who do not fall in the high risk category recover well without any medical intervention. The best prevention is to follow the respiratory protocols and cover face with tissue paper while sneezing or coughing to prevent others from the infection. A patient should properly dispose of the infected or used tissues and wash hands frequently.Experts have repeatedly expressed to ‘The News’ that influenza viruses are constantly changing themselves for their best survival and the H1N1 infection that has become less virulent in the past few years is still circulating and is capable of causing high mortality in a segment of population.The most common symptoms of influenza A infection include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, feeling tired and weak, sneezing, sore throat and cough while a child patient may have abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting as well.It is, however, important to mention that the virus that causes covid-19 is different from the virus that causes influenza though influenza A virus also spreads through droplets from the nose or throat of an infected person, normally though coughing and sneezing.

Samples were taken from the farms for test and reports confirmed that the chickens died of Avian Influenza (H5N1). Following this, poultry owners in Nellore culled hundreds of birds and the Andhra Pradesh government took action to prevent the spread of bird flu to other parts of the State. The government also banned the sale and transportation of chicken and eggs within a 10-km radius and also banned the sale of chicken meat for three months in nearby villages.Following this, poultry farms in Namakkal took precautionary measures. There are over 1,500 poultry farms in Namakkal district with over five crore chickens. Eggs are being sent to Kerala, various parts of Tamil Nadu and foreign countries. The poultry owners are instructed by the poultry farm owners association to follow biosafety norms strictly. Every vehicle entering the farms is disinfected.Chairman of Tamil Nadu Egg Poultry Farmers Marketing Society, Vangli Subramaniam, asked the public not to panic. In Namakkal district, every poultry farm followed biosafety norms strictly and the Animal Husbandry Department also gave instructions to the farms. While setting up the farm, adequate facilities were created for biosafety measures in Namakkal district. So people could buy chicken and meat as usual without any fear, he said.“We urge the government to ban the use of plastic trays for eggs and instruct the use of paper trays.

File photo. Image: Minna Rosvall / YleYle News19.2. 11:54The protective efficacy offered by the influenza vaccine has proved to be reasonably good this winter season, Finland's public health authority THL said on Monday morning, although this finding is based on preliminary data.The efficacy rate for people aged 65 and over stands at about 54 percent this year, the figures revealed, while children under the age of seven also have a moderately high protection rate, at 45 percent.According to the national infectious diseases register, maintained by THL, the number of flu cases being reported is on the decline.The agency however also noted that there is still a need for people to get the flu jab, as the virus continues to spread throughout the country, affecting people of all ages.The vaccine is free of charge for children, the elderly and other people at risk. Those wishing to receive the flu jab are advised to contact their regional welfare authority, known in Finland as wellbeing service counties.Flu cases still spreadingBy 10 February, the national infectious diseases register had recorded that more than 1.7 million doses of flu vaccine were administered over the winter months.This amounts to a vaccination coverage of about 30 percent, THL said."Coverage in older age groups has generally been reasonably high compared to younger age groups," THL's Chief Medical Officer Hanna Nohynek stated in an agency press release. "This season's flu vaccination campaign targeted parents of young children, but there have been no major changes in children's vaccination coverage."The majority of flu cases this winter have been influenza A, but isolated cases of influenza B have also been reported."Influenza A is currently the predominant virus, but the peak of the epidemic has passed," THL's senior specialist Niina Ikonen said.However, based on visits to health centres, Ikonen added that influenza cases are still prevalent throughout the country, describing the number of cases as "rife" in some parts.Users with an Yle ID can leave comments on our news stories.

activity down slightly, province's Respiratory Watch saysBobbi-Jean MacKinnon · CBC News · Posted: Feb 21, 2024 10:46 AM EST | Last Updated: February 21New Brunswick has the worst COVID-19 hazard index in Canada at 16.0. The next highest is Manitoba at 12.8, while Quebec has the lowest at 6.1. (COVID-19 Resources Canada)Social SharingNew Brunswick's COVID-19 hazard index is the highest in the country and more than double the national average, according to researchers analyzing COVID data from across Canada, as the provincial government reported two more deaths from the virus and a week-over-week increase in hospitalizations.The province's COVID-19 forecast for Feb. 17 to March 2 is 16, or "severe," data from COVID-19 Resources Canada shows.Canada's score is 7.6, or "very high."Both are decreasing, Tara Moriarty, co-founder of the group, posted on social media.The hazard index is calculated from three equally weighted categories: mortality, current infections and spread, and health-care system impact.Estimated 1 in 20 infectedAbout one in every 20 New Brunswickers is infected, said Moriarty, an associate professor at the University of Toronto.Across Canada, an estimated one in every 47 people are infected.Compared to lowest point of pandemic in Canada, New Brunswick infections are about 26 times higher, Moriarty said.Hospitalizations are about eight times, deaths are about 22 times higher, and long COVID, about 15 times higher.Nationally, COVID infections are currently about nine times higher than the lowest point of the pandemic, hospitalizations, about five times higher, deaths, about 13 times higher, and long COVID, eight times higher.COVID hospitalizations increase nearly 41%COVID-19 activity remains moderate, according to the province's Respiratory Watch report, released Wednesday instead of Tuesday, because of the long weekend."Most indicators (number of cases, percent positivity and number of outbreaks) decreased during the current reporting period," Feb. 4 to Feb. 10, it says.CBC has requested an interview with Dr. Yves Léger, the province's acting chief medical officer of health.The two New Brunswickers who died from COVID-19 during the reporting week were both aged 65 or older.There were 31 New Brunswickers hospitalized Feb. 4-10, raising the total to 1,280 since the respiratory season began on Aug. 27. (CBC)Their deaths raise the pandemic death toll to at least 1,011. The actual total is unclear because the province has counted only people who die in hospital as COVID deaths since September.Thirty-one people have been newly admitted to hospital for or with COVID during the reporting week, according to the Respiratory Watch report. That's a nearly 41 per cent increase from the 22 people hospitalized in the previous report.Four people required intensive care, down from five.3 youths hospitalizedAmong those hospitalized are two children under age four and a youth aged five to 19.The others include three people aged 20 to 44, four aged 45 to 64, and 21 aged 65 or older, the report shows.Two COVID outbreaks have been confirmed by lab tests, both in nursing homes, down from eight.There has also been a decrease in new COVID cases confirmed through PCR (polymerase chain reaction) lab tests, at 76, compared to 86. The province has limited PCR tests since April to people with a referral from a health-care provider, and for whom the result will directly influence their treatment or care.The positivity rate — the percentage of PCR lab tests performed that produced a positive result — has dropped to six per cent, from seven per cent.A total of 143,494 COVID-19 XBB.1.5 vaccines have been administered since since Oct. 4, according to figures from the Department of Health.No flu deaths, 11 hospitalizationsNo deaths from the flu were reported between Feb. 4 and Feb. 10, according to the Respiratory Watch report, but the virus sent 11 people to hospital, including a child under four and a youth aged five to 19.The other people hospitalized include two aged 20 to 44, one aged 45 to 64, and six aged 65 or older.One person required intensive care, the one aged 45 to 64.The previous week, 12 people were hospitalized and none were admitted to ICU."Influenza activity slightly decreased" during the reporting week, the report says.Two lab-confirmed outbreaks have been reported, the same number as the previous week. One is in a nursing home and one in a facility described only as "other."5 schools report 'influenza-like' outbreaksFive schools have "influenza-like illness" outbreaks, down from six. No information, such as the names of the schools, the number of cases and whether it's students or staff affected, has been released.School outbreaks are based on 10 per cent absenteeism in a school because of influenza-like illness symptoms, the report says.There have been 93 new flu cases confirmed by lab tests, with a positivity rate of eight per cent. That's down from 102 cases and a positivity rate of nine per cent.The breakdown of the new cases includes 58 influenza A (unsubtyped), seven influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, and 28 influenza B.These raise the total to 2,437 since the start of the respiratory season on Aug. 27.There have now been 217,519 New Brunswickers vaccinated against the flu this season, the Department of Health says.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories COVID-19 and flu each kill 2 more in N.B., 4 youths among 34 people hospitalized N.B. keeps watch for measles, urges vaccines, as European cases surge COVID-19 and the flu kill 6 more New Brunswickers Education department has no plans for COVID-19 pandemic response review COVID-19 kills 3 more in N.B., new variant JN.1 appears poised to become dominantFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

He made the disclosure while addressing journalists shortly after fumigating a farm infected with the disease located at Amanawa village, Kalgo, outskirts of Birnin Kebbi on Sunday. The disease had so far killed 14 peacocks in the affected facility. The fumigation was carried out by a team of professionals under “One Health”, comprising experts from ministries of Animal Husbandry, Health, Environment, Information, as well as Principal Partners. Mr Ibrahim-Sanchi said the essence of the exercise was to curtail spread. He explained that some peacocks were reported to have been ill and the pattern of mortality became worrisome, “so, we send a team of veterinary doctors for preliminary investigation. “Upon investigation, we found it necessary to take samples and those samples were sent to Veterinary Diagnostic Reference Laboratory in Jos. “When those samples were analysed, unfortunately for us, they returned positive for ‘Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1)’, so, this is what necessitated this exercise, to first of all come to the scene where these birds were resident and do the needful.” The director said that the main task was to ensure that the incident did not go beyond the affected facility, assuring that the team would go ahead and take active surveillance, “which is a pattern of seeking for other likely cases that may be occuring in our state.” He said that considering the fact that “highly pathogenic avian influenza is zoonotic infection that has the tendency to spread to humans”, the team had also undertaken the veterinary component of it, while colleagues in human health would identify individuals in contact with the animals for necessary action. Mr Ibrahim-Sanchi appealed to poultry owners to remain calm but be vigilant, and intensify bio-security, adding that “it is a disease that potent high economic lose for poultry owners.” He advised poultry farmers to share information with their colleagues, minimise the number of persons who visit the poultry. The director also enjoined them to restrict movement of birds, avoid sharing of farm implements to curb spread of the disease. Mr Ibrahim-Sanchi added that the ministry, in collaboration with sister ministries and agencies like ministry of health, environment and information and principal partners, were making efforts to sensitise the public on the disease.
