Vaccine effectiveness: Recent years have seen low to moderate effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines, indicating the need for improved vaccines that can protect against multiple influenza virus variants within each season.

Broadly reactive vaccines: Broadly reactive vaccine candidates have the potential to address the issue of variant strains, but their efficacy may decline as the viruses continue to mutate. Therefore, a method is needed to update broadly reactive vaccine antigens to better protect against current and future viral variants.

Next-generation H3N2 HA vaccines: Using a next-generation algorithm and design methodology, nine next-generation H3N2 influenza hemagglutinin (HA) vaccines were created. These vaccines demonstrated superiority in eliciting antibodies with high HAI activity against historical and co-circulating H3N2 influenza viruses, as well as the ability to neutralize future emerging H3N2 isolates.

Influenza virus circulation and severity: Seasonal influenza seasons dominated by A(H3N2) viruses tend to be more severe, resulting in a greater number of hospitalizations and deaths compared to seasons dominated by other subtypes. The 2017-2018 season, in particular, was severe and led to a high number of hospitalizations and deaths.

Vaccine effectiveness against A(H3N2) viruses: Vaccine effectiveness against A(H3N2) viruses is typically lower compared to effectiveness against A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses. The A(H3N2) component of the vaccine during the 2018-2019 season provided immune protection against only around 9% of A(H3N2) virus infections.

Composition of seasonal influenza vaccines: Seasonal influenza vaccines typically include strains from both influenza A subtypes (A(H1N1) and A(H3N2)) and strains representing the Victoria and Yamagata lineages of influenza B viruses. Trivalent vaccines containing one H1N1, one H3N2, and one influenza B strain are also used in some countries.
