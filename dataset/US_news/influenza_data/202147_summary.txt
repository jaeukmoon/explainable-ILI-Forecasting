Flu in Young Adults: Flu activity is increasing in the United States, with more than 90% of laboratory-confirmed influenza infections occurring in children and young adults. Hot spots of activity are observed in urban areas with large colleges or universities. The predominant strain is the influenza A(H3N2) virus, but other respiratory viruses may also be contributing to the increase in ILI activity.

Prevention Strategies: Vaccination is emphasized as the best way to prevent the spread of flu. Other preventive measures include staying home when sick, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and frequent handwashing. Antiviral drugs can be used for treatment, especially in individuals at higher risk of complications, but they do not substitute for vaccination.

Thanksgiving Travel Concerns: The upcoming Thanksgiving holiday and young adults traveling may lead to community-wide spread of flu. This highlights the importance of ongoing flu and COVID-19 vaccination efforts, as well as individuals taking precautions for their own health and the health of others.

Low Vaccination Coverage in Young Adults: Despite the known rapid spread of flu on college campuses, young adults consistently have the lowest flu vaccination coverage each season. For example, an outbreak at the University of Michigan found that only about one-quarter of infected individuals had been vaccinated. Similar outbreaks have been reported at other colleges and universities across the country.

Interpreting ILI Data: Visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) do not always indicate influenza virus infection, as other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, can cause similar symptoms. Laboratory data on flu and other respiratory viruses are essential for a complete understanding of ILI activity.
