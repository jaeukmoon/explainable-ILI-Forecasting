Improving Access to Influenza Countermeasures: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is taking steps to improve access to antiviral drugs, specifically Tamiflu, for U.S. jurisdictions in case of an increased demand due to multiple illnesses circulating during the winter season. This includes allowing jurisdictions to use their own stockpiles of Tamiflu that were procured between 2006-2009 for pandemic preparedness. Additionally, jurisdictions can request additional supplies of Tamiflu from the Strategic National Stockpile if needed. This initiative aims to ensure that there is an adequate supply of antiviral medication available to combat influenza.
