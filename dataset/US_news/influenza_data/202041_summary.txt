- Traditional influenza vaccines primarily induce a narrow antibody response that offers no protection against heterosubtypic infections.
- Murine studies have shown that T cells can protect against a broad range of influenza strains.
- Ferrets are a potent model for studying immune correlates of protection in influenza infection.
- H1N1-priming induced systemic and respiratory T cells that responded against pandemic H2N2 in ferrets.
- CD8-positive T cell responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract were exceptionally high.
- H2N2-responsive T cells are present in healthy human blood donors.
- These findings underline the importance of the T cell response in influenza immunity and show that T cells are a potent target for future universal influenza vaccines.
