Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. For each recipient, a licensed and age-appropriate vaccine should be used. ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for a specific vaccine when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate vaccine is available. During the 2021–22 influenza season, the following types of vaccines are expected to be available: inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s), recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4). The 2021–22 influenza season is expected to coincide with continued circulation of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Influenza vaccination of persons aged ≥6 months to reduce prevalence of illness caused by influenza will reduce symptoms that might be confused with those of COVID-19. Prevention of and reduction in the severity of influenza illness and reduction of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and intensive care unit admissions through influenza vaccination also could alleviate stress on the U.S. health care system. Guidance for vaccine planning during the pandemic is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html. Recommendations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/covid-19.html, and additional clinical guidance is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html. Updates described in this report reflect discussions during public meetings of ACIP that were held on October 28, 2020; February 25, 2021; and June 24, 2021. Primary updates to this report include the following six items. First, all seasonal influenza vaccines available in the United States for the 2021–22 season are expected to be quadrivalent. Second, the composition of 2021–22 U.S. influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) components. U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain hemagglutinin derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture–based and recombinant vaccines), an influenza A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus, an influenza B/Washington/02/2019 (Victoria lineage)-like virus, and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. Third, the approved age indication for the cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine, Flucelvax Quadrivalent (ccIIV4), has been expanded from ages ≥4 years to ages ≥2 years. Fourth, discussion of administration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines includes considerations for coadministration of influenza vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines. Providers should also consult current ACIP COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and CDC guidance concerning coadministration of these vaccines with influenza vaccines. Vaccines that are given at the same time should be administered in separate anatomic sites. Fifth, guidance concerning timing of influenza vaccination now states that vaccination soon after vaccine becomes available can be considered for pregnant women in the third trimester. As previously recommended, children who need 2 doses (children aged 6 months through 8 years who have never received influenza vaccine or who have not previously received a lifetime total of ≥2 doses) should receive their first dose as soon as possible after vaccine becomes available to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received by the end of October. For nonpregnant adults, vaccination in July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. Sixth, contraindications and precautions to the use of ccIIV4 and RIV4 have been modified, specifically with regard to persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to an influenza vaccine. A history of a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of any egg-based IIV, LAIV, or RIV of any valency is a precaution to use of ccIIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution to use of RIV4. Use of ccIIV4 and RIV4 in such instances should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting under supervision of a provider who can recognize and manage a severe allergic reaction; providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction. For ccIIV4, history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency or any component of ccIIV4 is a contraindication to future use of ccIIV4. For RIV4, history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4 is a contraindication to future use of RIV4. This report focuses on recommendations for the use of vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza during the 2021–22 influenza season in the United States. A brief summary of the recommendations and a link to the most recent Background Document containing additional information are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html. These recommendations apply to U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines used according to Food and Drug Administration–licensed indications. Updates and other information are available from CDC’s influenza website (https://www.cdc.gov/flu); vaccination and health care providers should check this site periodically for additional information. Top Introduction Influenza viruses typically circulate annually in the United States, most commonly from the late fall through the early spring. Most persons who become ill after influenza virus infection recover without serious complications or sequelae. However, influenza can be associated with serious illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, particularly among older adults, very young children, pregnant women, and persons of all ages with certain chronic medical conditions (1–7). Influenza also is an important cause of missed work and school (8–10). Routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications has been recommended by CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2010 (11). Vaccination provides important protection from influenza illness and its potential complications. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination varies depending on several factors, such as the age and health of the recipient; the type of vaccine administered; the types, subtypes (for influenza A), and lineages (for influenza B) of circulating influenza viruses; and the degree of similarity between circulating viruses and those included in the vaccine (12). During the six influenza seasons from 2010–11 through 2015–16, influenza vaccination prevented an estimated 1.6–6.7 million illnesses, 790,000–3.1 million outpatient medical visits, 39,000–87,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000–10,000 respiratory and circulatory deaths each season in the United States (13). During the severe 2017–18 season, notable for an unusually long duration of widespread high influenza activity throughout the United States and higher rates of outpatient visits and hospitalizations compared with recent seasons, vaccination prevented an estimated 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, and 8,000 deaths (14), despite an overall estimated vaccine effectiveness of 38% (62% against influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 viruses, 22% against influenza A[H3N2] viruses, and 50% against influenza B viruses) (14). In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged as a cause of severe respiratory illness (15). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, a global pandemic (16). As of August 12, 2021, approximately 36.3 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in the United States, including approximately 617,000 deaths (17). Although influenza activity during the 2020–21 season was low throughout the United States (18), the timing and intensity of the upcoming 2021–22 influenza season cannot be predicted. Influenza vaccination remains an important tool for the prevention of potentially severe respiratory illness, which might decrease stress on the U.S. health care system during ongoing circulation of SARS-CoV-2. Guidance for vaccine planning during the COVID-19 pandemic is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html. This report updates the 2020–21 ACIP recommendations regarding the use of seasonal influenza vaccines (19) and provides recommendations and guidance for vaccine providers regarding the use of influenza vaccines in the United States for the 2021–22 season. Various formulations of influenza vaccines are available (Table 1). Contraindications and precautions for the use of influenza vaccines are summarized (Tables 2 and 3). Abbreviations are used in this report to denote the various types of vaccines (Box). This report focuses on recommendations and guidance for the use of seasonal influenza vaccines for the prevention and control of influenza during the 2021–22 season in the United States. A summary of these recommendations and a Background Document containing additional information on influenza, influenza-associated illness, and influenza vaccines are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/flu.html. Top Methods ACIP provides annual recommendations for the use of influenza vaccines for the prevention and control of influenza in the United States. The ACIP Influenza Work Group meets by teleconference once to twice per month throughout the year. Work group membership includes several voting members of ACIP, representatives of ACIP liaison organizations, and consultants. Discussions include topics such as influenza surveillance, vaccine effectiveness and safety, vaccination coverage, program feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and vaccine supply. Presentations are requested from invited experts, and published and unpublished data are discussed. The Background Document that supplements this report is updated periodically to reflect recent additions to the literature related to recommendations made in previous seasons and minor changes in guidance for the use of influenza vaccines (e.g., guidance for timing of vaccination and other programmatic issues, guidance for dosage in specific populations, guidance for selection of vaccines for specific populations that are already recommended for vaccination, and changes that reflect use that is consistent with indications and prescribing information licensed by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]). The summary included in the Background Document for such topics is not a systematic review; it is intended to provide an overview of current literature, with updated articles being identified primarily through a broad search for English-language articles on influenza and influenza vaccines. In general, systematic review and evaluation of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (20) is performed for new recommendations or substantial changes in the current recommendations (e.g., expansion of the recommendation for influenza vaccination to new populations not previously recommended for vaccination or potential preferential recommendations for specific vaccines). Primary updates and changes to the recommendations described in this report include 1) discussion of influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2021–22 influenza season; 2) the vaccine virus composition for 2021–22 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines; 3) recent regulatory actions, including one influenza vaccine labeling change that occurred after the publication of the 2020–21 ACIP influenza statement (19); 4) considerations for influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic; 5) updates to the recommendations concerning timing of vaccination; and 6) updates to the discussion of contraindications and precautions to influenza vaccines. Information relevant to these changes includes the following: Availability of specific types and brands of licensed seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States is determined by the manufacturers of the vaccines. Information presented concerning vaccines expected to be available and their approved indications and usage reflects current knowledge and is subject to change. Recommendations for the composition of Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines are made by WHO, which organizes a consultation, generally in February of each year. Surveillance data are reviewed, and candidate vaccine viruses are discussed. Information concerning the WHO meeting of February 26, 2021, for selection of the 2021–22 Northern Hemisphere vaccine viruses is available at https://www.who.int/publications/m/itemecommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2021-2022-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season. Subsequently, FDA, which has regulatory authority over vaccines in the United States, convenes a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). This committee considers the recommendations of WHO, reviews and discusses similar data, and makes a final decision regarding vaccine virus composition of influenza vaccines licensed and marketed in the United States. Materials from the VRBPAC discussion of March 5, 2021, during which the composition of the 2021–22 U.S. influenza vaccines was discussed, are available at https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-march-5-2021-meeting-announcement#event-information. Regarding recommendations concerning newly licensed influenza vaccines and changes to the licensed indications for existing vaccines, ACIP relies on FDA for review of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy and effectiveness data pertaining to licensure and labeling of influenza vaccines. Regulatory information pertinent to the change in age indication for Flucelvax Quadrivalent discussed in this report is available at https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/flucelvax-quadrivalent. Guidance concerning timing of influenza vaccination relative to administration of COVID-19 vaccines is coordinated with current ACIP recommendations and CDC guidance for the use of COVID-19 vaccines. This information might change as data and clinical experience with COVID-19 vaccines evolve. ACIP recommendations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/covid-19.html. Interim clinical guidance for the use of COVID-19 vaccines is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html. These pages should be checked periodically for updated information. Guidance for the timing of influenza vaccination in specific populations is based on the potential timing of availability of influenza vaccines each season, typical timing of the U.S. influenza season, need for receipt of 2 doses separated by ≥4 weeks before the start of the influenza season for some children aged 6 months through 8 years (those who have never received influenza vaccine or who have not previously received a lifetime total of ≥2 doses), and lack of influenza vaccines for children aged <6 months (for whom maternal vaccination offers protection against influenza). Information regarding indications, contraindications, and precautions for influenza vaccines is reviewed. Differences between ACIP recommendations and package labeling are noted in the text. Labeled contraindications and precautions are indicated (Table 2); contraindications and precautions recommended by ACIP also are noted. Package inserts for U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines are available at https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/vaccines-licensed-use-united-states. Top Primary Changes and Updates Routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications continues to be recommended. ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for a specific influenza vaccine when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate vaccine is available. Updated information in this report includes the following: All seasonal influenza vaccines expected to be available for the 2021–22 season are quadrivalent, containing hemagglutinin (HA) derived from one influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, one influenza A(H3N2) virus, one influenza B/Victoria lineage virus, and one influenza B/Yamagata lineage virus. The composition of the 2021–22 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines includes updates to the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) components. For the 2021–22 season, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines will contain an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture–based and recombinant vaccines); an influenza A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus; an influenza B/Washington/02/2019 (Victoria lineage)-like virus; and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. One labeling change is described. In March 2021, FDA granted approval for the use of Flucelvax Quadrivalent (cell culture–based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [ccIIV4]) for children aged 2 through <4 years. Flucelvax Quadrivalent had previously been approved for persons aged ≥4 years; approval for those aged 4 through <18 years was based on immunogenicity data and required a postmarketing efficacy study. The new approval is based on a randomized observer-blinded clinical efficacy study conducted among children aged 2 through <18 years over three seasons, in which Flucelvax Quadrivalent demonstrated efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza of 54.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 45.7%–62.1%) compared with a noninfluenza control vaccine. Flucelvax Quadrivalent is now approved for persons aged ≥2 years (21). Guidance regarding administration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines has been updated to reflect consideration for COVID-19 vaccination, which is expected to continue in the United States before and during the 2021–22 influenza season. Current guidance for the use of COVID-19 vaccines indicates that these vaccines can be coadministered with other vaccines, including influenza vaccines. Providers should consult current COVID-19 vaccine recommendations and guidance for up-to-date information. ACIP recommendations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/covid-19.html. Interim clinical guidance for the use of COVID-19 vaccines is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html. These pages should be checked periodically for updated information. Guidance concerning timing of vaccination has been modified. For women in the third trimester of pregnancy, vaccination soon after vaccine becomes available can now be considered. As in previous seasons, children who need 2 doses of influenza vaccine administered ≥4 weeks apart (those aged 6 months through 8 years who have never received influenza vaccine or who have not previously received a lifetime total of ≥2 doses) are recommended to receive the first dose as soon as possible after vaccine becomes available. For nonpregnant adults, early vaccination (i.e., in July and August) should be avoided unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. Contraindications and precautions to the use of ccIIV4 and RIV4 have been modified, specifically with regard to persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to an influenza vaccine. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any egg-based IIV, LAIV, or RIV of any valency is a precaution to use of ccIIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution to use of RIV4. Use of ccIIV4 and RIV4 in such instances should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting under supervision of a provider who can recognize and manage a severe allergic reaction; providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction. For ccIIV4, history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency or any of component of ccIIV4 is a contraindication to future use of ccIIV4. For RIV4, history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4 is a contraindication to future use of RIV4. Top Recommendations for the Use of Influenza Vaccines, 2021–22 Groups Recommended for Vaccination Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. Recommendations regarding timing of vaccination, considerations for specific populations, the use of specific vaccines, and contraindications and precautions are summarized in the sections that follow. Timing of Vaccination Balancing considerations regarding the unpredictability of timing of onset of the influenza season and concerns that vaccine-induced immunity might wane over the course of a season (22–35), particularly for older adults (22,24,27,31,32,35), vaccination is recommended to be offered by the end of October. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses (i.e., children in this age group who have never received influenza vaccine or who have not previously received a lifetime total of ≥2 doses; see Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years) should receive their first dose as soon as possible after the vaccine becomes available to allow the second dose (which must be administered ≥4 weeks later) to be received, ideally, by the end of October. Children of any age who require only 1 dose for the season should also ideally be vaccinated by the end of October; vaccination of these children may occur as soon as vaccine is available because there is less evidence to suggest that early vaccination is associated with waning immunity among children compared with adults (24,25,28,33). Vaccination soon after vaccine becomes available may also be considered for pregnant women during the third trimester because vaccination of pregnant women reduces risk for influenza illness in their infants during the first months of life (a period during which they are too young to receive influenza vaccine) (36–40). For nonpregnant adults, influenza vaccination during July and August should be avoided unless there is concern that later vaccination might not be possible. Early vaccination might be associated with decreased vaccine effectiveness before the end of the influenza season, particularly among older adults (22,24,27,32,35). Community vaccination programs should balance maximizing the likelihood of persistence of vaccine-induced protection through the season with avoiding missed opportunities to vaccinate or vaccinating after onset of influenza circulation occurs. Efforts should be structured to optimize vaccination coverage before influenza activity in the community begins. Vaccination should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. To avoid missed opportunities for vaccination, providers should offer vaccination during routine health care visits and hospitalizations. No recommendation is made for revaccination (i.e., providing a booster dose) later in the season of persons who have already been fully vaccinated for the season, regardless of when the current season vaccine was received. During the 2021–22 influenza season, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate in the United States, and COVID-19 vaccinations are expected to continue. Current guidance for the administration of COVID-19 vaccines (available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html) indicates that these vaccines can be administered with other vaccines, including influenza vaccines; providers should consult this page for updated information. Guidance for vaccine planning during the pandemic is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html. Additional discussion of coadministration of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines can be found in the section on Administration of Influenza Vaccines with Other Vaccines. Optimally, vaccination should occur before onset of influenza activity in the community. However, because timing of the onset, peak, and decline of influenza activity varies, the ideal time to start vaccinating cannot be predicted each season. Moreover, more than one outbreak might occur in a given community in a single year. In the United States, localized outbreaks that indicate the start of seasonal influenza activity can occur as early as October. However, in 27 (75%) of 36 influenza seasons from 1982–83 through 2017–18, peak influenza activity (which often is close to the midpoint of influenza activity for the season) has not occurred until January or later, and in 21 (58%) seasons, the peak was in February or later (41). Activity peaked in February in 15 (42%) of these seasons (41). An increasing number of observational studies (22–35) have reported decreases in vaccine effectiveness with increasing time postvaccination within a single influenza season. Waning effects have not been observed consistently across age groups, influenza viruses (types, subtypes, and lineages), and seasons. Some studies suggest waning occurs to a greater degree with influenza A(H3N2) viruses than with influenza A(H1N1) or influenza B viruses (27,29). This effect also might vary with recipient age; in some studies, waning was more pronounced among older adults (22,24,27,31,32,35) and younger children (24). Relatively fewer reports include results specific to children (24,25,28,33); findings suggestive of waning have been reported in some (24,25,28) but not others (33). Rates of decline in vaccine effectiveness also varied. A multiseason (2011–12 through 2014–15) analysis from the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu VE) Network found that vaccine effectiveness decreased by approximately 7% per month for influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B and 6%–11% per month for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (26). Vaccine effectiveness remained greater than zero for at least 5–6 months after vaccination. In the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) during the 2015–16 through 2018–19 seasons, vaccine effectiveness declined by approximately 8%–9% per month for all adults and approximately 10%–11% per month for those aged ≥65 years (35). An analysis of the 2010–11 through 2013–14 seasons noted estimated effectiveness ranging from 54% to 67% during days 0–180 postvaccination; estimated vaccine effectiveness was not statistically significant during the period between days 181 and 365 (25). A third multiseason analysis (2010–11 through 2014–15) conducted in Europe noted a decline in vaccine effectiveness to 0% at 111 days postvaccination for influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Vaccine effectiveness against influenza B viruses decreased more slowly, and vaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses remained roughly stable at 50%–55% through the influenza season (29). A meta-analysis of 14 studies examining waning of influenza vaccine effectiveness using the test-negative design found a significant decline in effectiveness within 180 days following vaccination for influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B but not for influenza A(H1N1) (42). In addition to the factors observed to be associated with waning immunity across studies, observed decreases in protection might be at least in part attributable to bias, unmeasured confounding, or the late-season emergence of antigenic drift variants that are less well-matched to the vaccine viruses. Variable data concerning the presence and rate of waning immunity after influenza vaccination, coupled with the unpredictable timing of the influenza season each year, prevent determination of an optimal time to vaccinate. Programmatic issues are also a consideration: although delaying vaccination might result in greater immunity later in the season, deferral also might result in missed opportunities to vaccinate as well as difficulties in vaccinating a population within a more constrained period. The potential contributions of these factors among persons aged ≥65 years have been assessed using a simulated mathematical model examining various scenarios of vaccination timing, timing of onset of the influenza season, rate of waning, and vaccine effectiveness (43). In this model, during an influenza season beginning in October and peaking in January, delaying vaccination until October resulted in more hospitalizations if >14% of persons aged ≥65 years who would have been vaccinated in August or September failed to get vaccinated. However, these predictions varied considerably with assumed timing of season onset, rate of waning immunity, and vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination efforts should continue throughout the season because the duration of the influenza season varies, and influenza activity might not occur in certain communities until February or March. Providers should offer influenza vaccine routinely, and organized vaccination campaigns should continue throughout the influenza season, including after influenza activity has begun in the community. Although vaccination by the end of October is recommended, vaccine administered in December or later, even if influenza activity has already begun, might be beneficial in most influenza seasons. Providers should still offer influenza vaccination to unvaccinated persons who have already become ill with influenza during the season because the vaccine might protect them against other circulating influenza viruses. Guidance for Use in Specific Populations and Situations Populations at Higher Risk for Medical Complications Attributable to Severe Influenza All persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications should be vaccinated annually. However, vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for persons who are at increased risk for severe illness and complications from influenza and for influenza-related outpatient, emergency department, or hospital visits. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on administering vaccination to persons at higher risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza who do not have contraindications. These persons include the following (no hierarchy is implied by order of listing): All children aged 6 through 59 months; All persons aged ≥50 years; Adults and children who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (excluding isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus); Persons who are immunocompromised due to any cause (including but not limited to immunosuppression caused by medications or HIV infection); Women who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season; Children and adolescents (aged 6 months through 18 years) who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection; Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities; American Indians/Alaska Natives; and Persons who are extremely obese (body mass index ≥40 for adults). An IIV4 or RIV4 (as appropriate for the recipient’s age) is suitable for persons in all risk groups. LAIV4 is not recommended for some populations, including some of these listed groups. Contraindications and precautions to the use of LAIV4 are noted (Table 2). Persons Who Live with or Care for Persons at Higher Risk for Influenza-Related Complications All persons aged ≥6 months without contraindications should be vaccinated annually; however, in addition to persons at higher risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza, emphasis also should be placed on vaccination of persons who live with or care for those who are at increased risk. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on administering vaccination to persons at higher risk for influenza-related complications, as well as persons who live with or care for such persons, including the following: Health care personnel, including all paid and unpaid persons working in health care settings who have the potential for exposure to patients or to infectious materials. These personnel might include (but are not limited to) physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, therapists, technicians, emergency medical service personnel, dental personnel, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, autopsy personnel, students and trainees, contractual staff, and other persons not directly involved in patient care but who might be exposed to infectious agents (e.g., clerical, dietary, housekeeping, laundry, security, maintenance, administrative, and billing staff and volunteers). ACIP guidance for vaccination of health care personnel has been published previously (44); Household contacts (including children aged ≥6 months) and caregivers of children aged ≤59 months (i.e., aged <5 years) and adults aged ≥50 years, particularly contacts of children aged <6 months; and Household contacts (including children aged ≥6 months) and caregivers of persons with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza. Health care personnel and persons who are contacts of persons in these groups (with the exception of contacts of severely immunocompromised persons who require a protected environment) may receive any influenza vaccine that is otherwise indicated. Persons who care for severely immunocompromised persons requiring a protected environment should receive either IIV4 or RIV4. ACIP and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) have previously recommended that health care personnel who receive LAIV should avoid providing care for severely immunosuppressed patients requiring a protected environment for 7 days after vaccination and that hospital visitors who have received LAIV should avoid contact with such persons for 7 days after vaccination (45). However, such persons need not be restricted from caring for or visiting less severely immunosuppressed patients. Influenza Vaccination of Persons with COVID-19 Experience with influenza vaccination of persons with COVID-19 is limited. Considerations regarding vaccination of persons who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who are in quarantine after an exposure should include whether bringing the recipient into a vaccination setting could expose others to COVID-19, whether the person is acutely ill and the severity of the illness, presence of risk factors for severe influenza illness, the likelihood of being able to vaccinate at a later date, and the desire to avoid confusing postvaccination symptoms with those of COVID-19 illness. In general, those who are in quarantine or isolation should not be brought to a vaccination setting if doing so could expose others to COVID-19. For those who have moderate or severe COVID-19, vaccination should generally be deferred until they have recovered, which is consistent with ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (46). For persons who have mild or asymptomatic COVID-19, further deferral might be considered to avoid confusing COVID-19 illness symptoms with postvaccination reactions. Because recommendations for vaccination of this population might continue to evolve, clinicians should check current CDC guidance (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pandemic-guidance/index.html) for up-to-date information. Children Aged 6 Months Through 8 Years Vaccines and dose volumes for children aged 6 through 35 months: Four IIV4s are approved for ages ≥6 months; one is approved for ages ≥2 years. The appropriate dose volumes for some of these vaccines differ for children aged <36 months from those for older children and adults (Table 4). For these vaccines, approved age indications and dose volumes are as follows: Afluria Quadrivalent is approved for ages ≥6 months. The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is 0.25 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. Fluarix Quadrivalent is approved for ages ≥6 months. The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. FluLaval Quadrivalent is approved for ages ≥6 months. The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. Fluzone Quadrivalent is approved for ages ≥6 months. The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months should receive 0.5 mL per dose. Flucelvax Quadrivalent is approved for ages ≥2 years. The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥24 months (≥2 years). Alternatively, healthy children aged ≥24 months (≥2 years) may receive LAIV4, 0.2 mL intranasally (0.1 mL in each nostril). LAIV4 is not recommended for some populations (see Contraindications and Precautions for the Use of LAIV4) (Table 2), and is not approved for children aged <2 years. RIV4 is not approved for children aged <18 years. High-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4) and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV4) are not approved for persons aged <65 years. Care should be taken to administer an age-appropriate vaccine at the appropriate volume for each dose. For IIV4s, the recommended volume may be administered from a prefilled syringe containing the appropriate volume (as supplied by the manufacturer), a single-dose vial, or a multidose vial. Afluria Quadrivalent is approved for children aged 6 through 35 months at 0.25 mL per dose. Fluzone Quadrivalent is approved for children aged 6 through 35 months at either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose. However, the 0.25-mL prefilled syringe presentation of Fluzone Quadrivalent is not anticipated to be available for the 2021–22 season. If a prefilled syringe of Fluzone Quadrivalent is used for a child in this age group, the dose volume will be 0.5 mL per dose. Single-dose, 0.5-mL vials of Fluzone Quadrivalent should be used for only 1 dose, and multidose vials for only 10 doses, regardless of the volume of the doses taken or any remaining volume in the vial. Any vaccine remaining in a vial after the maximum number of doses has been removed should be discarded. Number of doses for children aged 6 months through 8 years: Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart during their first season of vaccination for optimal protection (47–50). Determination of the number of doses needed is based on 1) the child’s age at the time of the first dose of 2021–22 influenza vaccine and 2) the number of doses of influenza vaccine received in previous influenza seasons: For those aged 6 months through 8 years, the number of doses of influenza vaccine needed for the 2021–22 influenza season is determined as follows (Figure): Those who have previously received ≥2 total doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine ≥4 weeks apart before July 1, 2021, require only 1 dose for the 2021–22 season. The 2 previous doses of influenza vaccine do not need to have been administered in the same season or consecutive seasons. Those who have not previously received ≥2 doses of trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine ≥4 weeks apart before July 1, 2021, or whose previous influenza vaccination history is unknown, require 2 doses for the 2021–22 season. The interval between the 2 doses should be ≥4 weeks. Two doses are recommended even if the child turns age 9 years between receipt of dose 1 and dose 2. Adults and children aged ≥9 years need only 1 dose of influenza vaccine for the 2021–22 season. Pregnant Women Pregnant and postpartum women have been observed to be at higher risk for severe illness and complications from influenza, particularly during the second and third trimesters. Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk for respiratory illness and influenza among pregnant and postpartum women, as well as infants during the first several months of life (36–40). ACIP and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that those who are pregnant or who might be pregnant or postpartum during the influenza season receive influenza vaccine (51,52). Any licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4 may be used. LAIV4 should not be used during pregnancy but can be used postpartum. Influenza vaccine can be administered at any time during pregnancy, before and during the influenza season. Although experience with the use of IIVs during pregnancy is substantial, data specifically reflecting administration of influenza vaccines during the first trimester are relatively limited (see Safety of Influenza Vaccines in the supplementary Background Document). Most studies have not noted an association between influenza vaccination and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion (53–63). One observational Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) study conducted during the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons noted an association between receipt of IIV containing influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and risk for spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) in the 28 days after receipt of IIV, when an H1N1pdm09-containing vaccine had also been received the previous season (64). However, in a larger VSD follow-up study, IIV was not associated with an increased risk for spontaneous abortion during the 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15 seasons, regardless of previous season vaccination (65). Substantially less experience exists with more recently licensed IIVs (e.g., quadrivalent and cell culture–based vaccines) during pregnancy as compared with previously available products. For RIV (available as RIV3 from 2013–14 through 2017–18 and as RIV4 since 2017–18), data are limited to reports of pregnancies occurring incidentally during clinical trials, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports, and pregnancy registries. Pregnancy registries and surveillance studies exist for some products; information can be found in package inserts. Older Adults Because of the vulnerability of older adults to influenza-associated severe illness, hospitalization, and death, efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines in this population is an area of active research (see Immunogenicity, Efficacy, and Effectiveness of Influenza Vaccines: HD-IIV3, aIIV3, and RIV4 for Older Adults in the Background Document). Comparative studies of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes among older adults have focused on Fluzone High-Dose (HD-IIV3) (66), Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) (67), and Fluad (aIIV3) (68) (see Table in the Background Document). These studies have evaluated each of these three vaccines compared with standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIVs (SD-IIVs). HD-IIV3 has been the most extensively studied in this regard, and evidence has accumulated for its superior efficacy and effectiveness compared with SD-IIV3 in this population. For the 2020–21 season, quadrivalent formulations of high-dose (HD-IIV4) and adjuvanted (aIIV4) influenza vaccines were introduced; trivalent formulations of these vaccines will not be available for the 2021–22 season. Data summarizing comparisons of these newer quadrivalent formulations relative to standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4 against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are not yet available. Moreover, data from studies comparing the efficacy or effectiveness of HD-IIVs, aIIVs, and RIV4 directly with one another against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes among older adults are limited. In comparative safety studies, some injection site and systemic reactions were observed more frequently in older persons vaccinated with HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 (69,70). Fluzone High-Dose (HD-IIV3) met prespecified criteria for superior efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza compared with that of standard-dose Fluzone (SD-IIV3) in a randomized trial conducted over two influenza seasons (2011–12 and 2012–13) among 31,989 persons aged ≥65 years (66,71). For the primary outcome (prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza caused by any viral type or subtype and associated with protocol-defined influenza-like illness [ILI]), the relative efficacy of Fluzone HD-IIV3 compared with Fluzone SD-IIV3 was 24.2% (95% CI = 9.7%–36.5%). These findings are further supported by results from retrospective studies of data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Veterans Administration, as well as a cluster-randomized trial of HD-IIV3 compared with SD-IIV among older adults in nursing homes (72–76). A meta-analysis reported that HD-IIV3 provided better protection than SD-IIV3 against ILI (relative vaccine effectiveness = 19.5%; 95% CI = 8.6%–29.0%); all-cause hospitalizations (relative vaccine effectiveness = 9.1%; 95% CI = 2.4%–15.3%); and hospitalizations due to influenza (relative vaccine effectiveness = 17.8%; 95% CI = 8.1%–26.5%), pneumonia (relative vaccine effectiveness = 24.3%; 95% CI = 13.9%–33.4%), and cardiorespiratory events (relative vaccine effectiveness = 18.2%; 95% CI = 6.8%–28.1%) (77). For the 2020–21 season, HD-IIV3 was replaced by Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent (HD-IIV4). HD-IIV4 exhibited noninferior immunogenicity compared with HD-IIV3 in a randomized trial (78,79); estimates of relative efficacy compared with standard-dose nonadjuvanted IIV4 against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are not available. In an exploratory analysis of data from a single-season (2014–15) randomized trial conducted among 8,604 adults aged ≥50 years, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4) was more efficacious than SD-IIV4 (67,80); however, no claim of superiority was approved for the package insert (80). For the primary outcome (protocol-defined ILI caused by any influenza virus type or subtype and confirmed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]), the relative vaccine effectiveness of RIV4 compared with SD-IIV4 was 30% (95% CI = 10%–47%). When restricted to persons aged ≥65 years, the relative vaccine effectiveness of RIV4 was 17% (95% CI = −20%–43%). In an observational study from a single season (2011–12), Fluad (aIIV3) was more effective against laboratory-confirmed influenza than nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 among adults aged ≥65 years (N = 227, 165 of whom received aIIV3 and 62 SD-IIV3) (68); the population receiving aIIV3 had a higher proportion of persons in long-term care facilities (81). The relative effectiveness of aIIV3 compared with nonadjuvanted SD-IIV3 was 63% (95% CI = 4%–86%). In other observational studies, aIIV3 was associated with reduced risk for hospitalization for pneumonia and influenza diagnoses (82) and pneumonia, cerebrovascular, or cardiovascular diagnoses relative to nonadjuvanted IIV3 in studies of medical record data (83). For the 2021–22 season, Fluad (aIIV3) is no longer expected to be available. The quadrivalent formulation (Fluad Quadrivalent, aIIV4) met prespecified immunogenicity criteria relative to a noninfluenza control vaccine in a randomized trial; although the primary efficacy outcome was not met, the majority of influenza infections during the study were associated with a mismatched A(H3N2) virus (84,85). In a second randomized study examining immunogenicity of aIIV4 relative to aIIV3, aIIV4 met prespecified noninferiority criteria compared with aIIV3 for all four viruses. When considered individually, aIIV3 and aIIV4 each met criteria for seroconversion and proportion of participants achieving an HA titer of 1:40 for the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses; however, neither the quadrivalent nor trivalent vaccines met these criteria for the influenza B viruses. This might have been related to the lower likelihood of generating this response in a highly vaccinated population (86,87). Estimates of relative efficacy of aIIV4 compared with nonadjuvanted IIV4 against laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes are not yet available. Data reflecting comparisons of HD-IIVs, aIIVs, and RIVs are limited. Retrospective analyses of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data from the 2017–18, 2018–19, and 2019–20 influenza seasons, each including 12–13 million persons aged ≥65 years, have compared effectiveness of various vaccine types relative to egg-based, standard-dose, unadjuvanted IIV4 against influenza-associated hospital encounters (hospitalizations and emergency department visits, defined by International Classification of Diseases [ICD] codes) (88–90). These analyses included HD-IIV3, aIIV3, and ccIIV4 for all three seasons; RIV4 was included in the 2019–20 analysis. Compared with egg-based IIV4, for the 2017–18 season, relative effectiveness was noted with ccIIV4 (11.0%), HD-IIV3 (9.0%), and aIIV3 (3.9%); for 2018–19, with aIIV3 (7.7%) and HD-IIV3 (4.9%); and for 2019–20, with RIV4 (13.3%), aIIV3 (8.2%), and HD-IIV3 (6.8%). One postlicensure randomized clinical trial in the United States evaluated the comparative safety of aIIV3 compared with HD-IIV3 in 757 adults aged ≥65 years (378 who received aIIV3 versus 379 who received HD-IIV3) (91). For the primary outcome, the proportion of participants who reported moderate to severe injection site pain that limited or prevented activity after aIIV3 (12 participants [3.2%]) was noninferior compared with the proportion reporting this outcome following HD-IIV3 (22 participants [5.8%]). No participant sought medical care for a solicited reaction symptom, and none had a serious adverse event determined by study investigators to be related to vaccine within 43 days after vaccination. ACIP will continue to review data on the efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines as more information becomes available. No preference is expressed for any one vaccine type. Vaccination should not be delayed if a specific vaccine is not readily available. For persons aged ≥65 years, any age-appropriate IIV4 formulation (standard dose or high dose, nonadjuvanted or adjuvanted) or RIV4 is an acceptable option. Immunocompromised Persons ACIP recommends that persons with immunocompromising conditions (including but not limited to persons with congenital and acquired immunodeficiency states, persons who are immunocompromised due to medications, and persons with anatomic and functional asplenia) should receive an age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4. ACIP recommends that LAIV4 not be used for these groups because of the uncertain but biologically plausible risk for disease attributable to the live vaccine virus. Use of LAIV4 in persons with these and other conditions is discussed in more detail (see Dosage, Administration, Contraindications, and Precautions) (Table 2). Immunocompromised states comprise a heterogeneous range of conditions with varying risks for severe infections. In many instances, limited data are available regarding the use of influenza vaccines in the setting of specific immunocompromised states. Timing of vaccination might be a consideration (e.g., vaccinating during some period either before or after an immunocompromising intervention). The Infectious Diseases Society of America has published detailed guidance for the selection and timing of vaccines for persons with specific immunocompromising conditions (92). Immune response to influenza vaccines might be blunted in persons with some conditions, such as persons with congenital immune deficiencies, and persons receiving cancer chemotherapy or immunosuppressive medications. Persons with a History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome After Influenza Vaccination A history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of a previous dose of any type of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution to influenza vaccination (Table 2). Persons who are not at higher risk for severe influenza complications (see Populations at Higher Risk for Medical Complications Attributable to Severe Influenza) and who are known to have experienced GBS within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination generally should not be vaccinated. As an alternative to vaccination, providers might consider using influenza antiviral chemoprophylaxis for these persons (93). However, the benefits of influenza vaccination might outweigh the possible risks for certain persons who have a history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of influenza vaccine and who also are at higher risk for severe complications from influenza. Persons with a History of Egg Allergy Most available influenza vaccines, with the exceptions of RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent, licensed for those aged ≥18 years) and ccIIV4 (Flucelvax Quadrivalent, licensed for those aged ≥2 years), are prepared by propagation of virus in embryonated eggs and might contain trace amounts of egg proteins, such as ovalbumin. For persons who report a history of egg allergy, ACIP recommends the following: Persons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only urticaria (hives) after exposure to egg should receive influenza vaccine. Any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any IIV4, RIV4, or LAIV4) that is otherwise appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status can be used. Persons who report having had reactions to egg involving symptoms other than urticaria (e.g., angioedema or swelling, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent vomiting) or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention can similarly receive any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine (i.e., any IIV4, RIV4, or LAIV4) that is otherwise appropriate for their age and health status. If a vaccine other than ccIIV4 or RIV4 is used, the selected vaccine should be administered in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting (including but not necessarily limited to hospitals, clinics, health departments, and physician offices). Vaccine administration should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. All vaccine providers should be familiar with their office emergency plan and be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (46). No postvaccination observation period is recommended specifically for egg-allergic persons. However, ACIP recommends that vaccine providers consider observing patients (seated or supine) for 15 minutes after administration of any vaccine to decrease the risk for injury should syncope occur (46). Persons with Previous Allergic Reactions to Influenza Vaccines As is the case for all vaccines, influenza vaccines contain various components that might cause allergic and anaphylactic reactions. Most influenza vaccine package inserts list among contraindications to their use a history of previous severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine. For ccIIV4 and RIV4, history of a severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component is listed as a contraindication; no labeled contraindication is specified for history of allergic reaction to any other influenza vaccine. However, severe allergic reactions, although rare, can occur after influenza vaccination, even among persons with no previous reactions or known allergies. Although vaccine components can be found in package inserts, identifying the causative component without further evaluation (i.e., through evaluation and testing for specific allergies) can be difficult. Severe allergic reactions after vaccination with an RIV have been reported to VAERS, including some that have occurred among persons reporting previous allergic reactions to egg or to influenza vaccines and that might represent a predisposition to development of allergic manifestations in affected persons (94–96). Because these rare but severe allergic reactions can occur, ACIP recommends the following for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of an influenza vaccine (Table 3): For egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4: A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a contraindication to future receipt of all egg-based IIV4s and LAIV4. Each individual egg-based IIV4 and LAIV4 is also contraindicated for persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of that vaccine. For ccIIV4: A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution to the use of ccIIV4. If ccIIV4 is administered in such instances, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers also can consider consultation with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency or to any component of ccIIV4 is a contraindication to future receipt of ccIIV4. For RIV4: A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency is a precaution to the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered in such instances, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help determine the vaccine component responsible for the allergic reaction. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any RIV of any valency or to any component of RIV4 is a contraindication to future receipt of RIV4 Vaccination Issues for Travelers In temperate climate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, influenza activity is seasonal, occurring approximately from October–May in the Northern Hemisphere and April–September in the Southern Hemisphere. In the tropics, influenza might occur throughout the year. Travelers can be exposed to influenza when traveling to an area where influenza is circulating or when traveling as part of large tourist groups (e.g., on cruise ships) that include persons from areas of the world where influenza viruses are circulating (97–100). Travelers who want to reduce their risk for influenza should consider influenza vaccination, preferably at least 2 weeks before departure. In particular, persons who live in the United States and are at higher risk for influenza complications and who were not vaccinated with influenza vaccine during the previous Northern Hemisphere fall or winter should consider receiving influenza vaccination before departure if they plan to travel to the tropics, to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season (April–September), or with organized tourist groups or on cruise ships to any location. Persons at higher risk who received the previous season’s influenza vaccine before travel should consult with their health care provider to discuss the risk for influenza and other travel-related diseases before embarking on travel during the summer. All persons (regardless of risk status) who are vaccinated in preparation for travel before the upcoming influenza season’s vaccine is available should receive the current vaccine the following fall or winter. Influenza vaccine formulated for the Southern Hemisphere might differ in viral composition from the Northern Hemisphere vaccine. For persons traveling to the Southern Hemisphere during the Southern Hemisphere influenza season, receipt of a current U.S.-licensed Southern Hemisphere formulation influenza vaccine before departure might be reasonable but might not be feasible because of limited access to or unavailability of Southern Hemisphere formulations in the United States. Most Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations are not licensed in the United States, and they are generally are not commercially available. More information on influenza vaccines and travel is available at https://wwwnc.cdc.govravel/diseases/influenza-seasonal-zoonotic-and-pandemic. Use of Influenza Antiviral Medications Administration of IIV4 or RIV4 to persons receiving influenza antiviral medications for treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza is acceptable. Data concerning vaccination with LAIV4 in the setting of influenza antiviral use are not available. However, influenza antiviral medications might interfere with the action of LAIV4 because this vaccine contains live influenza viruses. The package insert for LAIV4 notes that antiviral agents might reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine if given within the interval from 48 hours before to 14 days after vaccination (101). However, the newer influenza antivirals peramivir and baloxavir have longer half-lives than oseltamivir and zanamivir, with approximately 20 hours for peramivir (102) and 79 hours for baloxavir (103), and could conceivably interfere with the replication of LAIV4 if administered >48 hours before vaccination. Potential interactions between influenza antivirals and LAIV4 have not been studied, and the ideal intervals between administration of these medications and LAIV4 are not known. Assuming a period of at least 5 half-lives for substantial decline in drug levels (104), it is reasonable to assume that peramivir might interfere with the mechanism of LAIV4 if administered from 5 days before through 2 weeks after vaccination, and baloxavir might interfere if administered from 17 days before through 2 weeks after vaccination. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV4 for which interference might occur could be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Persons who receive these medications during these periods before or after receipt of LAIV4 should be revaccinated with another appropriate influenza vaccine (e.g., IIV4 or RIV4). Administration of Influenza Vaccines with Other Vaccines With regard to administration of influenza vaccines with vaccines other than COVID-19 vaccines, guidance is as follows. IIV4s and RIV4 may be administered simultaneously or sequentially with other inactivated vaccines or live vaccines. Injectable vaccines that are given concomitantly should be administered at separate anatomic sites. LAIV4 can be administered simultaneously with other live or inactivated vaccines. However, if two live vaccines are not given simultaneously, then after administration of one live vaccine (such as LAIV4), at least 4 weeks should pass before another live vaccine is administered (46). Guidance concerning administration of COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html) indicates that these vaccines may be given with other vaccines, including influenza vaccines. No data are yet available concerning coadministration of U.S.-authorized COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines. Providers should be aware of the potential for increased reactogenicity with coadministration and should consult the CDC guidance as more information becomes available. If administered simultaneously, COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines that might be more likely to cause a local reaction (e.g., aIIV4 or HD-IIV4) should be administered in different limbs, if possible. Relatively limited data are available on the concomitant administration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines. Studies of live attenuated zoster vaccine and IIV3 (105) or IIV4 (106) among persons aged ≥50 years noted similar antibody responses whether the two vaccines were administered concomitantly or 4 weeks apart. In some studies, reduced responses have been noted to 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) (107,108), tetanus antigens (109), and pertussis antigens (109) when coadministered with IIV3 to adults; in most instances, the clinical significance of this is uncertain. Simultaneous administration of IIV4 and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) to persons aged ≥65 years was associated with lower seroprotection rates to one influenza B antigen at 4–6 weeks postvaccination as compared with sequential administration 2 weeks apart; seroprotection was not significantly different between the two groups for any of the four influenza antigens at 6 months postvaccination (110). Reassuring safety profiles have been noted for simultaneous administration of IIVs with live attenuated zoster vaccine (105,106); PCV13 (107,108); PPSV23 (110,111); tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine among adults (109); and Tdap in pregnancy (112). Although increased prevalence of injection site or systemic adverse reactions has been noted with concurrent administration in some of these studies, these symptoms have generally been reported to be mild or moderate. Among children aged 6 through 23 months, coadministration of IIV3 and PCV13 was associated with increased risk for fever on the day of vaccination and the day after (i.e., days 0–1 postvaccination) in an observational study conducted during the 2011–12 season (113). A randomized clinical trial during the 2017–18 influenza season suggested that delaying IIV4 administration by 2 weeks in children receiving DTaP and PCV13 did not reduce fever prevalence after vaccination (114). Increased risk for febrile seizures in this age group has been noted within days 0–1 after coadministration of IIV with PCV7, PCV13, or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines during the 2006–07 through 2010–11 seasons (115) and with PCV13 during the 2014–15 season (116). Although concerning to parents, most febrile seizures are brief and have a good prognosis (117). After considering the risks and benefits, no changes in the recommendations for administration of these vaccines were made, and these vaccines can be given concomitantly. Surveillance of febrile seizures is ongoing through VAERS, and the VSD annual influenza safety surveillance includes monitoring for seizures after vaccinations. Studies of concomitant administration of LAIV with other vaccines are limited. Concurrent administration of LAIV3 with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccine to children was not associated with diminished immunogenicity to antigens in any of the vaccines in one study (118); diminished response to rubella was observed in another study examining coadministration of LAIV3 and MMR (119). No safety concerns were noted in these studies. In recent years, several vaccines containing nonaluminum adjuvants have been licensed for use in the United States for the prevention of various infectious diseases. These include AS01B (in Shingrix, recombinant zoster subunit vaccine) (120), MF59 (in Fluad Quadrivalent [aIIV4]) (121), and cytosine phosphoguanine oligodeoxynucleotide (in Heplisav-B, a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine) (122). Data are limited regarding coadministration of these vaccines with other adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines. Coadministration of Shingrix with nonadjuvanted IIV4 has been studied; no evidence of decreased immunogenicity or safety concerns were noted (123). The immunogenicity and safety of simultaneous or sequential administration of two nonaluminum-adjuvant–containing vaccines has not been evaluated, and the ideal interval between such vaccines when given sequentially is not known. In the study of Shingrix and IIV4 (123), most reactogenicity symptoms resolved within 4 days. Because of the limited data on the safety of simultaneous administration of two or more vaccines containing nonaluminum adjuvants and the availability of nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine options, selection of a nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine may be considered in situations in which influenza vaccine and another vaccine containing a nonaluminum adjuvant are to be administered concomitantly. However, influenza vaccination should not be delayed if a specific vaccine is not available. As recommended for all vaccines, vaccines with nonaluminum adjuvants should be administered at separate anatomic sites from other vaccines that are given concomitantly (46). Top Influenza Vaccine Composition and Available Vaccines Influenza Vaccine Composition for the 2021–22 Season All influenza vaccines licensed in the United States will contain components derived from influenza viruses antigenically similar to those recommended by FDA (https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-march-5-2021-meeting-announcement#event-information). Influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2021–22 season will be quadrivalent vaccines. For the 2021–22 season, U.S. egg-based influenza vaccines (i.e., vaccines other than ccIIV4 and RIV4) will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an influenza A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus; an influenza B/Washington/02/2019 (Victoria lineage)-like virus; and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. For the 2021–22 season, U.S. cell culture–based inactivated (ccIIV4) and recombinant (RIV4) influenza vaccines will contain HA derived from an influenza A/Wisconsin/588/2019 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an influenza A/Cambodia/e0826360/2020 (H3N2)-like virus; an influenza B/Washington/02/2019 (Victoria lineage)-like virus; and an influenza B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)-like virus. Vaccines Available for the 2021–22 Season Various influenza vaccines will be available for the 2021–22 season (Table 1). For many vaccine recipients, more than one type or brand of vaccine might be appropriate within approved indications and ACIP recommendations. A licensed influenza vaccine that is appropriate for the recipient’s age and health status should be used. Specific age indications for licensed influenza vaccines are summarized (Table 1); current prescribing information should be consulted for authoritative, up-to-date information. Overall contraindications and precautions for the different types of influenza vaccines are summarized (Table 2), including allergy-specific contraindications and precautions (Table 3), as are dose volumes (Table 4). Not all influenza vaccines are likely to be uniformly available in any given practice setting or geographic locality. Vaccination should not be delayed to obtain a specific product when an appropriate one is already available. Within these guidelines and approved indications, ACIP makes no preferential recommendation for the use of any one influenza vaccine over another when more than one licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate vaccine is available. Since the publication of the previous season’s guidance, FDA has approved a labeling change for Flucelvax Quadrivalent (see Recent Influenza Vaccine Labeling Changes). Additional new licensures and changes to FDA-approved labeling might occur after publication of this report. As these changes occur and new vaccines become available, they will be reflected in the online version of Table 1, available at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/acip/2021-2022/acip-table.htm. Dosage, Administration, Contraindications, and Precautions Quadrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (IIV4s) Available vaccines: As in recent seasons, various inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) are expected to be available for 2021–22 (Table 1); all are expected to be quadrivalent (IIV4s). Certain IIV4s are licensed for persons as young as age 6 months. However, licensed age indications differ for different products. Moreover, for some IIV4s, the dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months differs from that for older children and adults (Table 4). Care should be taken to administer the appropriate dose volume of an age-appropriate vaccine to each recipient. Standard-dose, nonadjuvanted IIV4s contain 15 μg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.5-mL dose (7.5 μg of HA per vaccine virus in a 0.25-mL dose). For 2021–22, this category is expected to include five different vaccines (Table 1). Four of these are egg-based vaccines, and one is a cell culture–based vaccine. Egg-based and cell culture–based vaccines differ in the substrate in which reference vaccine viruses supplied to the manufacturer are propagated in quantities sufficient to produce the needed number of doses of vaccine. The egg-based IIV4s, Afluria Quadrivalent (124), Fluarix Quadrivalent (125), FluLaval Quadrivalent (126), and Fluzone Quadrivalent (127), are approved for persons aged ≥6 months. The cell culture–based IIV4, Flucelvax Quadrivalent (ccIIV4), is approved for persons aged ≥2 years. For the manufacture of ccIIV4, the influenza vaccine viruses are propagated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells instead of eggs (21). Two additional IIV4s that will be available for the 2021–2022 season are approved for persons aged ≥65 years. These vaccines are egg based. Quadrivalent high-dose influenza vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent; HD-IIV4) contains 60 μg of HA per vaccine virus (240 μg total) in a 0.7-mL dose (128). Adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluad Quadrivalent; aIIV4) contains 15 μg of HA per vaccine virus (60 μg total) and MF59 adjuvant (121). Dosage and administration: Most, but not all, standard-dose unadjuvanted IIV4s are approved for children as young as age 6 months. One exception, Flucelvax Quadrivalent, is approved for persons aged ≥2 years. Some of these IIV4s are approved at different dose volumes for very young children than for older children and adults. Care should be taken to administer an age-appropriate vaccine at the approved dose volume for each needed dose (see Vaccines and Dose Volumes for Children Aged 6 Through 35 Months) (Tables 1 and 4): Afluria Quadrivalent is approved for ages ≥6 months. The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is 0.25 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. Fluarix Quadrivalent is approved for ages ≥6 months. The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. FluLaval Quadrivalent is approved for ages ≥6 months. The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥6 months. Fluzone Quadrivalent is approved for ages ≥6 months. The approved dose volume for children aged 6 through 35 months is either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose. Persons aged ≥36 months (≥3 years) should receive 0.5 mL per dose. Flucelvax Quadrivalent is approved for ages ≥2 years. The approved dose volume is 0.5 mL per dose for all persons aged ≥24 months (≥2 years). Care should be taken to administer the appropriate dose volume for the particular vaccine. If prefilled syringes are not available, the appropriate volume can be administered from a single-dose or multidose vial. If a 0.5-mL single-dose vial is used for a 0.25-mL dose for a child aged 6 through 35 months, only half the vial volume should be administered, and the remaining half should be discarded. Of note, dose volume is distinct from the number of doses. Children in this age group who require 2 doses for 2021–22 (see Children Aged 6 Months through 8 Years) (Figure) need 2 separate doses administered ≥4 weeks apart, regardless of the specific IIV4 used and volume given for each dose. For children aged 36 months (3 years) through 17 years and adults aged ≥18 years, the dose volume for IIV4s is 0.5 mL per dose, with the exception of Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent (HD-IIV4, licensed for persons aged ≥65 years), for which the correct volume is 0.7 mL per dose. If a smaller vaccine dose (e.g., 0.25 mL) is inadvertently administered to a person aged ≥36 months, the remaining volume needed to make a full dose should be administered during the same vaccination visit or, if measuring the needed remaining volume is a challenge, administering a repeat dose at the full volume is acceptable. If the error is discovered later (after the recipient has left the vaccination setting), a full dose should be administered as soon as the recipient can return. Vaccination with a formulation approved for adult use should be counted as a single dose if inadvertently administered to a child. IIV4s are administered intramuscularly (IM). For adults and older children, the deltoid is the preferred site. Infants and younger children should be vaccinated in the anterolateral thigh. Additional specific guidance regarding site selection and needle length for IM injection is provided in the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (46). One IIV4, Afluria Quadrivalent, is licensed for IM injection via the PharmaJet Stratis jet injector for persons aged 18 through 64 years (124). Persons in this age group may receive Afluria Quadrivalent via either needle and syringe or this specific jet injection device. Children aged 6 months through 17 years and adults aged ≥65 years should receive this vaccine by needle and syringe only. No other IIV4s are licensed for administration by jet injector. Contraindications and precautions for the use of IIV4s: Manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC and ACIP guidance should be consulted for information on contraindications and precautions for individual influenza vaccines. Each IIV, whether egg based or cell culture based, has a labeled contraindication for persons with a history of a severe allergic reaction to any component of that vaccine (Table 2). Although egg is a component of all IIV4s other than ccIIV4, ACIP makes specific recommendations for the use of influenza vaccine for persons with egg allergy (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy). All egg-based IIV4s are contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine (any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency). Use of ccIIV4 is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency; a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution to the use of ccIIV4 (see Previous Allergic Reactions to Influenza Vaccines) (Tables 2 and 3). If ccIIV4 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction. Information about vaccine components can be found in the package inserts for each vaccine. Prophylactic use of antiviral agents is an option that can be considered for preventing influenza among persons who cannot receive vaccine, particularly for those who are at higher risk for medical complications attributable to severe influenza (93). Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever is a general precaution for vaccination (46). A history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of a previous dose of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for the use of all influenza vaccines (Table 2). Quadrivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) Available vaccines: One recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok Quadrivalent (RIV4), is expected to be available during the 2021–22 influenza season. RIV4 is approved for persons aged ≥18 years. This vaccine contains recombinant HA produced in an insect cell line using genetic sequences from cell-derived influenza viruses and is manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs (80). No preference is expressed for RIV4 versus other influenza vaccines used within specified indications. Dosage and administration: RIV4 is administered by IM injection via needle and syringe. A 0.5-mL dose contains 45 μg of HA derived from each vaccine virus (180 μg total). Contraindications and precautions for the use of RIV4: RIV4 is contraindicated in persons who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any RIV of any valency or any component of RIV4. A history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any other influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, or LAIV of any valency) is a precaution to the use of RIV4. If RIV4 is administered in such an instance, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help identify the vaccine component responsible for the reaction. Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever is a general precaution for vaccination (46). A history of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of a previous dose of influenza vaccine is considered a precaution for the use of all influenza vaccines (Table 2). RIV4 is not licensed for children aged <18 years. Quadrivalent Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV4) Available vaccines: One live attenuated influenza vaccine, FluMist Quadrivalent (LAIV4), is expected to be available during the 2021–22 influenza season. LAIV4 is approved for persons aged 2 through 49 years. LAIV4 contains live attenuated influenza viruses that are propagated in eggs. These viruses are cold adapted (so that they replicate efficiently at 25°C) and temperature sensitive (so that their replication is restricted at higher temperatures, 39°C for influenza A viruses and 37°C for influenza B viruses). These viruses replicate in the nasopharynx, which is necessary to promote an immune response (101). No preference is expressed for LAIV4 versus other influenza vaccines used within specified indications. Dosage and administration: LAIV4 is administered intranasally using the supplied prefilled, single-use sprayer containing 0.2 mL of vaccine. Approximately 0.1 mL (i.e., half the total sprayer contents) is sprayed into the first nostril while the recipient is in the upright position. An attached dose-divider clip is removed from the sprayer to permit administration of the second half of the dose into the other nostril. If the recipient sneezes immediately after administration, the dose should not be repeated. However, if nasal congestion is present that might impede delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral of administration should be considered until resolution of the illness, or another appropriate vaccine should be administered instead. Each total dose of 0.2 mL contains 106.5–7.5 fluorescent focus units of each vaccine virus (101). Contraindications and precautions for the use of LAIV4: Conditions considered by ACIP to be contraindications and precautions to the use of LAIV4 are summarized (Table 2). These include two labeled contraindications that appear in the package insert (101) and other conditions for which there is uncertain but biologically plausible potential risk associated with live viruses or limited data for use of LAIV. Contraindications to use of LAIV4 include the following: Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine (i.e., any egg-based IIV, ccIIV, RIV, or LAIV of any valency; a labeled contraindication noted in the package insert). However, ACIP makes an exception for allergy to egg (see Persons with a History of Egg Allergy); Children and adolescents receiving concomitant aspirin or salicylate-containing medications (Table 2), because of the potential risk for Reye syndrome (a labeled contraindication noted in the package insert); Children aged 2 through 4 years who have received a diagnosis of asthma or whose parents or caregivers report that a health care provider has told them during the preceding 12 months that their child had wheezing or asthma or whose medical record indicates a wheezing episode has occurred during the preceding 12 months; Children and adults who are immunocompromised due to any cause, including but not limited to immunosuppression caused by medications, congenital or acquired immunodeficiency states, HIV infection, anatomic asplenia, or functional asplenia (such as that due to sickle cell anemia); Close contacts and caregivers of severely immunosuppressed persons who require a protected environment; Pregnancy; Persons with active communication between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the oropharynx, nasopharynx, nose, or ear or any other cranial CSF leak; Persons with cochlear implants, because of the potential for CSF leak, which might exist for some period after implantation (providers might consider consulting with a specialist concerning the risk for persistent CSF leak if an age-appropriate inactivated or recombinant vaccine cannot be used); and Receipt of influenza antiviral medication within the previous 48 hours for oseltamivir and zanamivir, previous 5 days for peramivir, and previous 17 days for baloxavir. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV4 for which interference might potentially occur might be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Precautions for use of LAIV4 include the following: Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever; History of GBS within 6 weeks after receipt of any influenza vaccine; Asthma in persons aged ≥5 years; and Other underlying medical condition (other than those listed under contraindications) that might predispose to complications after wild-type influenza virus infection (e.g., chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular [except isolated hypertension], renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders [including diabetes mellitus]). Recent Influenza Vaccine Labeling Changes Flucelvax Quadrivalent Since the publication of the 2020–21 ACIP influenza vaccine statement, there has been a labeling change for Flucelvax Quadrivalent (ccIIV4). Flucelvax Quadrivalent was initially approved in 2016 for persons aged ≥4 years. Approval for ages ≥18 years was based upon a randomized immunogenicity and safety trial which compared Flucelvax Quadrivalent with the previously approved trivalent formulation of Flucelvax (ccIIV3), which had previously been licensed for ages ≥18 years on the basis of data from a randomized clinical efficacy trial. Approval for ages 4 through 17 years was also based on immunogenicity and safety data compared with ccIIV3, with a postmarketing requirement to conduct a clinical efficacy study (129). In March 2021, FDA approved Flucelvax Quadrivalent for ages ≥2 years on the basis of a randomized clinical efficacy trial conducted among 4,514 children aged ≥2 through <18 years over three influenza seasons (Southern Hemisphere 2017 and Northern Hemisphere 2017–18 and 2018–19) (130). In this study, children were randomized 1:1 to receive ccIIV4 or a noninfluenza control vaccine (meningococcal serogroup ACWY conjugate vaccine). Overall vaccine efficacy was 54.6% (95% CI = 45.7–62.1) against CDC-defined ILI associated with RT-PCR–confirmed or culture-confirmed influenza due to all viral strains. Efficacy against culture-confirmed influenza was 60.8% (95% CI = 51.3–68.5) for all viral strains and 63.6% (95% CI = 53.6–71.5) for matched viral strains (21). Frequencies of serious adverse events and most systemic and local solicited adverse reactions were similar between the two study groups, and most solicited reactions were mild or moderate (21,130). With this labeling change, Flucelvax Quadrivalent is now approved for persons aged ≥2 years. Top Storage and Handling of Influenza Vaccines In all instances, approved manufacturer packaging information should be consulted for authoritative guidance concerning storage and handling of specific influenza vaccines. In general, influenza vaccines should be protected from light and stored at temperatures that are recommended in the package insert. Recommended storage temperatures are generally 36°F–46°F (2°C–8°C) and should be maintained at all times with adequate refrigeration and temperature monitoring. Vaccine that has frozen should be discarded. Specific recommendations for appropriate refrigerators and temperature monitoring equipment can be found in the Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit, available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/storageoolkit/index.html. Vaccines should not be used beyond the expiration date on the label. In addition to the expiration date, multidose vials also might have a Beyond Use Date (BUD), which specifies the number of days the vaccine can be kept once first accessed. Once accessed for the first dose, multidose vials should not be used after the BUD. If no BUD is provided, then the listed expiration date is to be used. Multidose vials should be returned to recommended storage conditions between uses. Package information might also specify a maximum number of doses contained in multidose vials (regardless of remaining volume). No more than the specified number of doses should be removed, and any remainder should be discarded. Single-dose vials should not be accessed for more than 1 dose. For information on permissible temperature excursions and other departures from recommended storage and handling conditions that are not discussed in the package labeling, contact the manufacturer. Top Additional Sources of Information Regarding Influenza and Influenza Vaccines Influenza Surveillance, Prevention, and Control Updated information regarding influenza surveillance, detection, prevention, and control is available at https://www.cdc.gov/flu. U.S. surveillance data are updated weekly throughout the year on FluView (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly) and FluView Interactive (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm). In addition, periodic updates regarding influenza are published in MMWR (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html). Additional information regarding influenza and influenza vaccines can be obtained from CDC-INFO by calling 1–800–232–4636. State and local health departments should be consulted about availability of influenza vaccines, access to vaccination programs, information related to state or local influenza activity, reporting of influenza outbreaks and influenza-related pediatric deaths, and advice concerning outbreak control. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires health care providers to report any adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to future doses of the vaccine or any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination (https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERS_Table_of_Reportable_Events_Following_Vaccination.pdf) that occurs within the specified period after vaccination. In addition to mandated reporting, health care providers are encouraged to report any clinically significant adverse event after vaccination to VAERS. Information on how to report a vaccine adverse event is available at https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html. National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, as amended, provides a mechanism through which compensation can be paid on behalf of a person determined to have been injured or to have died as a result of receiving a vaccine covered by VICP. The Vaccine Injury Table (https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/vaccinecompensation/vaccineinjurytable.pdf) lists the vaccines covered by VICP and the associated injuries and conditions (including death) that might receive a legal presumption of causation. If the injury or condition is not in the Table or does not occur within the specified period in the Table, persons must prove that the vaccine caused the injury or condition. Eligibility for compensation is not affected by whether a covered vaccine is used off-label or inconsistently with recommendations. To be eligible for compensation under VICP, a claim must be filed within 3 years after the first symptom of the vaccine injury. Death claims must be filed within 2 years of the vaccine-related death and not more than 4 years after the start of the first symptom of the vaccine-related injury from which the death occurred. When a new vaccine or a new injury/condition is added to the Table, claims that do not meet the general filing guidelines must be filed within 2 years from the date the vaccine or injury/condition is added to the Table for injuries or deaths that occurred up to 8 years before the Table change (131). Persons of all ages who receive a VICP-covered vaccine might be eligible to file a claim. Additional information is available at https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/index.html or by calling 1–800–338–2382.

Jill M. Ferdinands reports travel-related support that is unrelated to this work from the Institute for Influenza Epidemiology, which is funded in part by Sanofi Pasteur. Helen Keipp Talbot reports serving as the secretary for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, for which she receives no payment. No other potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.This report includes discussion of the unlabeled use of influenza vaccines in the instance of influenza vaccination of persons with a history of egg allergy. A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to the vaccine or any of its components (which include egg for some vaccines) is a labeled contraindication to receipt of most IIV4s and LAIV4. However, ACIP recommends that persons with a history of allergic reaction of any severity to egg should receive any licensed, recommended influenza vaccine that is appropriate for their age and health status. Persons with a history of severe allergic reaction to egg who receive egg-based vaccines (i.e., vaccines other than cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine [ccIIV4] or recombinant influenza vaccine [RIV4]) should be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting (including, but not necessarily limited to, hospitals, clinics, health departments, and physician offices); vaccine administration in such instances should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. No postvaccination waiting period is recommended specifically for egg-allergic persons. However, ACIP recommends that vaccine providers consider observing patients seated or supine for 15 minutes following administration of any vaccine (regardless of allergy history) to decrease the risk for injury should syncope occur. Top CDC Adoption of ACIP Recommendations for MMWR Recommendations and Reports, MMWR Policy Notes, and Immunization Schedules (Child/Adolescent, Adult) Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents, and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a Federal Advisory Committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of CDC on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccinations in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations approved by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the date published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

Those who report having had reactions to egg involving symptoms other than urticaria (e.g., angioedema or swelling, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis) or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention should be vaccinated in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting (including but not necessarily limited to hospitals, clinics, health departments, and physician offices) supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions, if a vaccine other than ccIIV4 or RIV4 is used. § The dose volume for Afluria Quadrivalent is 0.25 mL for children aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL for persons aged ≥3 years. ¶ IM-administered influenza vaccines should be given by needle and syringe only, with the exception of the MDV presentation of Afluria Quadrivalent, which may alternatively be given by the PharmaJet Stratis jet injector for persons aged 18 through 64 years only. For adults and older children, the recommended site for IM influenza vaccination is the deltoid muscle. The preferred site for infants and young children is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. Additional specific guidance regarding site selection and needle length for IM administration is available in the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/index.html. ** Fluzone Quadrivalent is currently approved for ages 6 through 35 months at either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose; however, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are not expected to be available for the 2021–22 influenza season. If a prefilled syringe of Fluzone Quadrivalent is used for a child in this age group, the dose volume will be 0.5 mL per dose. Top TABLE 2.

Vaccine administration should be supervised by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. § Labeled contraindication noted in package insert. ¶ If administered, vaccination should occur in a medical setting and should be supervised by a health care provider who can recognize and manage severe allergic reactions. Providers can consider consultation with an allergist in such cases, to assist in identification of the component responsible for the allergic reaction. ** Age-appropriate injectable vaccines are recommended for persons with cochlear implant due to the potential for CSF leak, which might exist for some period of time after implantation. Providers might consider consultation with a specialist concerning risk of persistent CSF leak if an age-appropriate inactivated or recombinant vaccine cannot be used. †† Use of LAIV4 in context of influenza antivirals has not been studied; however, interference with activity of LAIV4 is biologically plausible, and this possibility is noted in the package insert for LAIV4. In the absence of data supporting an adequate minimum interval between influenza antiviral use and LAIV4 administration, the intervals provided are based on the half-life of each antiviral. The interval between influenza antiviral receipt and LAIV4 for which interference might potentially occur might be further prolonged in the presence of medical conditions that delay medication clearance (e.g., renal insufficiency). Influenza antivirals might also interfere with LAIV4 if initiated within 2 weeks after vaccination. Persons who receive antivirals during the period starting with the specified time before receipt of LAIV4 through 2 weeks after receipt of LAIV4 should be revaccinated with an age-appropriate IIV or RIV4.

Providers can consider using the following vaccines in these instances; however, vaccination should occur in an inpatient or outpatient medical setting with supervision by a health care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions: 1) for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any egg-based IIV or LAIV of any valency, the provider can consider administering ccIIV4 or RIV4; 2) for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any ccIIV of any valency, the provider can consider administering RIV4; and 3) for persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any RIV of any valency, the provider can consider administering ccIIV4. Providers can also consider consulting with an allergist to help determine which vaccine component is responsible for the allergic reaction. TopBOX. Abbreviation conventions for influenza vaccines discussed in this report Main influenza vaccine types include: IIV = inactivated influenza vaccine RIV = recombinant influenza vaccine LAIV = live attenuated influenza vaccine Numerals following letter abbreviations indicate valency (the number of influenza virus hemagglutinin [HA] antigens represented in the vaccine): 4 for quadrivalent vaccines: one A(H1N1), one A(H3N2), and two B viruses (one from each lineage) 3 for trivalent vaccines: one A(H1N1), one A(H3N2), and one B virus (from one lineage) All influenza vaccines expected to be available in the United States for the 2021–22 season are quadrivalent vaccines. However, abbreviations for trivalent vaccines (e.g., IIV3) might be used in this document when discussing information specific to trivalent vaccines. Abbreviations for general vaccine categories (e.g., IIV) might be used when discussing information that is not specific to either trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines. Prefixes are used when necessary to refer to some specific IIVs: a for adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (e.g., aIIV3 and aIIV4) cc for cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine (e.g., ccIIV3 and ccIIV4) HD for high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (e.g., HD-IIV3 and HD-IIV4) SD for standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (e.g. SD-IIV3 and SD-IIV4) Top TABLE 4.

These two men signaled the beginning of the second deadly wave of the Spanish Flu. By the end of the week, 100 new cases a day were being reported among the sailors at the pier. By the beginning of September, the flu had spread to Boston’s civilian population. The below excerpt from Boston’s Health Department describes the beginning of the flu outbreak. The disease spread throughout the United States rapidly. During the fall of 1918 and spring of 1919, more than 675,000 Americans died from the Spanish Influenza. In Boston, officials closed schools and tried to limit crowded gatherings to combat the spread of the disease. Health officials also encouraged or mandated masking, banned the use of public drinking cups, and discouraged spitting in public. Halt the Epidemic! poster, 1918, George F. Tyler poster collection, Temple University Libraries Their efforts met with some success, but when World War I ended, crowds gathered to celebrate the armistice. Boston’s Health Department reported that cases of flu increased immediately after the celebration of the armistice. A similar increase in flu cases and deaths occurred after Bostonians gathered to celebrate Christmas. The Health Department documented this increase in their report below. Many of Boston’s residents were treated for the flu at Boston City Hospital, pictured below. The hospital’s trustees documented in their annual report that they treated 2,300 patients afflicted with influenza. 675 of those patients died from the disease. You can read an excerpt from the report below. The epidemic resulted in both an influx of patients and a shortage of staff at City Hospital. Prior to the flu epidemic, the hospital already faced a staff shortage because many of its doctors and nurses were serving in Europe. Student nurses at the hospital’s Training School stepped in to fill the gap. The below report from the hospital’s Training School for Nurses reported that “…the Training School went through the most difficult period in its history, practically swept clean of its supervisors and teachers. To the student body we owe much….” Bostonians throughout the city followed suit. Boston’s School Superintendent wrote that when the city shut down its schools, many teachers voluntarily helped their ill neighbors, even though they were not medically trained. Petrina Maravigna of the North End recalls her family stepping in to help ill neighbors. When three of their neighbors contracted the flu, eventually dying, her family first took the neighboring family food and then took in their children. By the end of 1918, over 4,000 Bostonians died from the flu, compared to 51 deaths the year prior. The below report from Boston’s Health Department compares the 1918 deaths to influenza deaths from previous years. The 1918 Spanish Influenza Epidemic spurred research that helped the medical community understand how diseases spread and how to better prepare for and treat the influenza virus.

Maureen Salamon August 27, 2021 Amid fresh national recommendations for COVID booster shots to ramp up waning immunity, new research examining the durability of flu vaccination indicates significantly dwindling protection just months after inoculation. Maximum influenza vaccine efficacy in adults occurred shortly after vaccination, followed by an average decline of 8% to 9% each month and an even swifter drop among older adults. Even a 1- or 2-month delay in annual flu vaccination could improve vaccine effectiveness by 10% to 20%, according to the study, published August 15 in Clinical Infectious Diseases. Dr Jill Ferdinands Analyzing vaccine timing relative to influenza-associated hospitalizations among more than 5500 adults, the findings are broadly consistent with both early and more recent studies, said study author Jill Ferdinands, PhD, an epidemiologist in the Influenza Division of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "These findings are not surprising," Ferdinands told Medscape Medical News. "In the very first successful trial of inactivated influenza vaccine in 1943, the study's authors observed that antibodies to influenza declined by about one third within 4 to 5 months after vaccination." US guidelines call for annual flu shots for everyone 6 months and older, but determining the best time to get vaccinated can be complicated, Ferdinands noted. Current recommendations — which Ferdinands said clinicians should continue to follow — suggest that ideally, vaccination should occur by the end of October. But, "a better understanding of waning immunity, like the information gained by this study, could help further optimize the recommendation," she said. Participants in the study were enrolled in the US Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN), presented with new or worsening cough or sputum production over the prior 10 days during the 2015-16 through 2018-19 flu seasons, and were hospitalized for acute respiratory illness. Patients testing positive for influenza were considered cases, while those testing negative were used as controls. Participants were considered vaccinated if they had documented evidence of at least one dose of influenza vaccine at least 14 days before they became ill. Datasets included 3016 adults (average age 60) analyzed for vaccine efficacy against hospitalizations associated with influenza A (H3N2); 1492 patients for influenza A (H1N1); and 1060 patients for influenza B/Yamagata. Overall, 34% had obtained vaccination by the end of September, 77% by the end of October, 92% by the end of November, and 97% by the end of December. Results were adjusted for factors such as age, race, season, past year hospitalizations, and indicators of underlying health conditions. Vaccine efficacy against influenza-associated hospitalizations declined by an average of 7.5%–8.5% for each 30 days postvaccination, depending on influenza type. These findings were more pronounced among older adults, with those 65 and older experiencing an average decline of 10.8% in vaccine efficacy for each 30 days after inoculation. Results suggest that delaying vaccination timing by even 1 or 2 months might improve vaccine effectiveness by 10% to 20%, Ferdinands said, and this approach deserves consideration "if [it] doesn't encroach on the annual influenza season, delay vaccine delivery, or reduce vaccine uptake." Public health benefits could be significant, given the millions who become ill and tens of thousands who die from influenza in the US each year, she added. While the study didn't examine variation in waning vaccine effectiveness by vaccine type or prior vaccination history, "it was large enough to look at the decline in vaccine protection among people 65 and older, a group for whom growing evidence suggests may be more likely to experience faster declines in vaccine protection," Ferdinands noted. A New York-based infectious disease specialist said the new study reinforces the need for a better flu vaccine "that's more effective for a longer period of time, rather than just a few months." "It's time to see whether a two-dose flu vaccine makes sense, maybe spaced out 3 or 4 months apart," said Harish Moorjani, MD, from Phelps Hospital of Northwell Health in Tarrytown, New York. Dr Harish Moorjani "I think we've known in general that vaccinations, for the most part, aren't forever," Moorjani told Medscape Medical News. "In some cases they are, but that's rare. With COVID, we do know we need three doses…with influenza, we need to ask the same question: Do we need two doses?" Moorjani praised the new research, saying it confirmed that current influenza vaccines are likely to decline in efficacy over time and that "people who are most vulnerable, including the [elderly] and those without immune competence" may experience faster drops. He said the COVID pandemic might prove to "actually be a shot in the arm for influenza vaccine research." "It will give us more incentive to learn more about how we make better vaccinations for influenza, because now we realize the effects of a virus can be devastating," Moorjani added. "Whatever makes this possible, we should absolutely do it." Ferdinands reports receiving nonfinancial travel support from the Institute for Influenza Epidemiology, funded in part by Sanofi Pasteur. Moorjani has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. The study was funded by the CDC, the National Institutes of Health Clinical and Translational Science Award program, and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

CloseWhen to get flu shot 2021: Doses already available at Walgreens, CVSSkip to main content HomeU.S.SportsEntertainmentLifeMoneyTechTravelOpinionFor SubscribersWeatherInvestigationsCrosswordsHumankindNewslettersMediaFor YouContributor Content Experts renew warnings of 'twindemic' as US enters flu season amid rising COVID-19 cases: 'We face the same threat this year'Adrianna Rodriguez | USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption Disney, Vegas, Apple are among those requiring new mask mandatesMask requirements return to many vacation spots, work places and schools.Staff Video, USA TODAYLast year's influenza season turned out to be the mildest on record, but health experts have renewed warnings that a ‘twindemic’ – in which flu and COVID-19 cases simultaneously rise and overwhelm hospitals – may be possible this year, and they urge Americans to get their flu shot.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 1,675 cases of influenza from Sept. 28 to May 22, representing only .2% of specimens tested. But it’s difficult to predict what this year will look like, health experts say.They worry it may resemble a more typical flu season, as students get back to in-person learning and states loosen mask and social distancing mandates amid a return to social gatherings.That is especially concerning as COVID-19 cases driven by the highly contagious delta variant rise throughout the country. A USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins data suggests the U.S. reported more than 1.05 million cases in the week that ended Monday, amounting to 104 cases every minute.Severe illness and deaths are also rising, filling ICU beds and threatening hospital capacity. The country recorded more than 7,200 COVID-19 deaths in the week that ended Monday, the equivalent of a Pearl Harbor attack three times a week, or a 9/11 attack every three days. “We were worried about the ‘twindemic’ last year and we face the same threat this year,” said Dr. Daniel Solomon, a physician in the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “COVID-19 is likely to continue, and we face the threat of dual respiratory viruses that could put a strain on our health care system.”Flu shots are now available at CVS and Walgreens, the country’s two largest retail pharmacies, and offer co-administration of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. The CDC reversed previous guidance to wait at least 14 days between the COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines, saying “you can get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines at the same visit.”Physicians haven’t yet seen any flu cases, but they are seeing an increase in other respiratory viruses that show conditions may be primed for fall and winter flu transmission.Why is Pfizer's COVID vaccine called Comirnaty? It's not easy to pronounce. But one thing is certain about the FDA-approved vaccine: It worksA warning from pediatricians: It's a 'no-no' to vaccinate children under 12 against COVID-19 – even though it's now legalRespiratory syncytial virus is a common virus that usually causes mild, coldlike symptoms primarily in children, according to the CDC. It’s the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger than 1 in the U.S.“Some of the cases of children that are being hospitalized with COVID also have a co-infection of RSV,” said Jeffrey Fischer, President at Longhorn Vaccines & Diagnostic, a privately held biotechnology company. “So one of the other concerns is that you see co-infections (of flu).”RSV in the summer doesn’t necessarily predict flu transmission in the fall and winter, Solomon said, but it shows children, who are efficient transmitters of flu, are interacting more in social settings.In addition to getting the flu vaccine, health experts say it’s important to practice some of the health measures from the pandemic that last year prevented flu transmission.A nationwide lockdown is not necessary, they say. They say wearing masks, practicing good hand hygiene and staying home from work when sick are sufficient to keep people from getting sick and infecting other vulnerable populations. “Last year, we didn’t have a very big flu season because people were using masks and that decreased the flu season activity,” said Dr. Ricardo Correa, endocrinologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine. “If we do the same thing this year and we wear masks as much as we can, then the flu season will not hit us as hard as years prior.”Solomon advises people to get their shot around October so protection will last throughout the entire flu season. But if for some reason they don’t have the flexibility to wait until then, he urges them to get vaccinated sooner rather than later. A typical flu season in the U.S. peaks between December and February and can last as late as May, according to the CDC.It's almost impossible to know whether someone has COVID-19 or the flu from symptoms alone, Solomon said. He urges everyone in this position to get diagnostic testing so they can receive the appropriate treatment early and avoid hospitalization“We do face this threat of multiple serious respiratory viruses circulating in our community simultaneously," he said. "If that comes to pass, it could strain our hospital system in ways we’re seeing now with COVID alone."Contributing: Mike Stucka, USA TODAY. Follow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.

Our machine learning experiments are conducted on publicly available challenge studies that collected whole-blood transcriptomics data from individuals infected with HRV, RSV, H1N1, and H3N2. We address the problem of identifying discriminatory biomarkers between controls and eventual shedders in the first 32 h post-infection. Our exploratory analysis shows that the most discriminatory biomarkers exhibit a strong dependence on time over the course of the human response to infection. We visualize the feature sets to provide evidence of the rapid evolution of the gene expression profiles. To quantify this observation, we partition the data in the first 32 h into four equal time windows of 8 h each and identify all discriminatory biomarkers using sparsity-promoting classifiers and Iterated Feature Removal. We then perform a comparative machine learning classification analysis using linear support vector machines, artificial neural networks and Centroid-Encoder. We present a range of experiments on different groupings of the diseases to demonstrate the robustness of the resulting models.

Such infections include a broad range of pathogens including influenza virus, human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. These transmission mechanisms are exacerbated by the fact that infected subjects may shed a virus even before the onset of symptoms1; the fraction of influenza virus infections that are caused by asymptomatic shedders is estimated to be 10–30%2. It is also widely speculated that pre-symptomatic shedding is an important feature of the transmission of COVID-193.The ability for asymptomatic individuals to shed virus has increased significance given the observation that some of these shedders are responsible for infecting large populations. There is significant evidence that, at least in some cases, the spread of infectious disease can be traced to a small fraction of the population who are typically asymptomatic and shed high volumes of pathogen4,5. These individuals are capable of infecting large numbers of the population and, therefore, are referred to as “super-shedders” of a pathogen, or “super-spreaders” of disease. A number of examples of this phenomenon have been documented including typhoid, tuberculosis, and measles virus6. There is evidence that super-shedders play a pivotal role in the spread of disease such as in the SARS outbreak of 20027. There is also emerging evidence of super-shedders in the COVID-19 pandemic8,9,10. However, little is known about the specific host responses to infection that contribute to shedding.The primary aim of this investigation is the development of a predictive model capable of distinguishing pre-symptomatic infected individuals from uninfected controls. This is accomplished via the analysis of host gene expression profiles of blood and the exploration of signatures of shedding before symptom onset. Based on evidence from machine learning analytics, these sample measurements provide significant discriminatory information related to the host immune response to infection soon after infection and significantly before the development of symptoms. Experimental findings suggest that gene expression associated with the immune response changes significantly, even within the first 8 h after infection. As such, they provide a wealth of quantitative information that can to be decoded to reflect discriminative signatures that can be used for predictive models as well as biological discovery.To accomplish our predictive modeling aim we focus on identification of signatures that are predictive of shedding within the first 32 h post-exposure. We begin with a visual exploration of data from infected individuals and visually demonstrate how clearly the movement of host response to disease through time is and lend visual justification to our premise that the prognosis, i.e., the prediction of the course of a disease, can be determined in the first 32 h. We provide visualizations to support this hypothesis. Next we implement feature selection algorithms designed to extract discriminatory sets on a variety of dataset groups and time windows. These machine learning algorithms, provide evidence that these feature sets are capable of identifying shedders in the first 32 h after exposure. Lastly, we show that these predictive features reflect biologically relevant host responses that may contribute directly to shedding.ResultsMethod overviewWe analyze microarray data of gene expression profiles of blood samples from individuals at different time points who were infected with HRV, RSV, H1N1 and H3N2 as part of several clinical challenge studies11. This data is publically available on the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with identifier GSE73072. The data was normalized using standard RMA (Robust Multi-array Average) normalization procedure on the entire dataset12. We implemented additional strategies for removing batch effects using Limma (LInear Models for MicroArray) including Subject ID and Study ID normalization13. The features of the datasets are probe set identifications associated with gene expression.The machine learning experiments were performed using binary classes. We take the negative class \(C^-\) as the class of controls, i.e., samples prior to infection, associated with the studies selected for the model. Our positive \(C^+\) class is comprised exclusively of samples from pre-symptomatic shedders. These samples were collected in the first 32 h after inoculation and prior to actual shedding. All samples in the positive class are from subjects who eventually will test positive for the challenge virus as confirmed by nasal swab tests.A novel tactic employed here is to separate the positive classes \(C^+\) as a function of time. Thus, we partition the positive samples into four windows of 8 h over the first 32 h. Again, although the samples in the positive class are from subjects who are not yet symptomatic, or shedding virus, they will all at some point in time be symptomatic and shed, i.e., will become clinically positive.Our analysis begins by using machine learning algorithms to first identify all features capable of discriminating between the control class \(C^-\) and the \(C^+\) positive shedder class for four distinct 8 h time bins spanning hours 1–8, 9–16, 17–24 and 25–32. Table 1 shows the number of samples for the control class and positive class for the different studies and time bins that are used to find the discriminatory feature sets. The set of discriminatory features for the first 8 h are found independently from the set of features identified in hours 9–16, and so on. These features are then ordered according to their estimated predictive power. Once ordered sets of discriminatory features have been established for each experiment, we conduct a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross validation experiment to evaluate the features.The net result of the feature extraction described above was Feature Sets 1–3, each constructed for the 8 h time intervals over the first 32 h. Feature Set 1 uses only the influenza data in the iterative feature removal (IFR)14 applied to each time-bin separately; Feature Set 2 is constructed similarly on the combined HRV, RSV, H1N1 and H3N2/DEE5 data while Feature Set 3 employs H1N1 (both sets) H3N2/DEE5 and HRV (both sets). This seemingly elaborate partitioning was done to explore the ability of different viruses to produce generally discriminatory features. The resulting feature sets are used to perform the machine learning experiments in this paper.Given that the number of control samples is generally a factor of two or more larger than the number of positive samples in \(C^+\), we compute classification accuracy using a Balanced Success Rate (BSR). BSR is defined as the average of the true positive rate and the true negative rate for a binary classification problem and accounts for imbalances between the classes.Table 1 Number of samples by study and time bin interval in hours over the first 32 h.Full size tableExploratory visualizationsThere is significant experimental evidence that the immune response may be viewed as a sequence of biological manufacturing processes. There is a collection of interacting biological pathways that produce a temporally evolving series of molecular defense mechanisms in an organized cascade. As such, the genes being expressed in these pathways at any given time after the initial infection will be changing as a reflection of this temporal progression of the host response. Understanding the temporal evolution of the gene expression is potentially important for accurate diagnosis and prognosis of patient outcome.As an illustration of the temporal evolution of the immune response, the host gene expression of the Reactome \(\alpha \)/\(\beta \) interferon pathway is visualized in Fig. 1. The \(\alpha \)/\(\beta \) interferon pathway plays a crucial role in host responses to viral infection such as the regulation of Type I interferon responses15. A visualization of this pathway illustrates the evolution of the host immune response to H1N1 as seen in Fig. 1. Genes associated with this pathway were extracted from pathway databases available via the Molecular Signatures Database16,17. Association of Entrez Gene IDs to microarray probe identifiers was done using the associated microarray platform file, resulting in 94 probes of interest.A standard principal component analysis (PCA)18 visualization of this gene expression data for all subjects and all time points is shown in Fig. 1a. The 94 probes associated to the pathway for each sample are projected to the 2 directions with maximum variance after mean subtraction. The reduced gene expression data associated with the H1N1 infection (studies DEE3 and DEE4) for this pathway are seen to remain relatively constant for subjects who do not shed virus. The non-shedder trajectories are shown in the blue. In contrast, subjects who are shedders have an excursion from the health state, seen as trajectories in red in Fig. 1a. The fact that these values return to their nominal value after some time indicates that biomarkers associated with this pathway are not uniformly discriminatory over the time evolution of the disease. This underlines the time-dependent nature of gene expression biomarkers for predictive modeling of the host immune response using machine learning.A neural network dimension reduction technique is applied to the \(\alpha \)–\(\beta \) interferon signalling pathway for the H1N1/DEE4 data shown in Fig. 1b; we select a single data set to minimize variation due to batch effects. The visualization is achieved using the nonlinear Centroid-Encoder (CE), a recently proposed supervised variation on the nonlinear autoencoder, i.e., CE visualization exploits class labels19,20. In this example the class labels correspond to the time intervals of the \(\alpha \)–\(\beta \) interferon signalling pathway. The nonlinear and supervised aspect of this reduction process make it ideal for extracting early variations in the pathway evolution. In Fig. 1b, the trajectories of the shedders exhibit large excursions (to purple) already after 5 h. The trajectories for this pathway appear to return towards the nominal state over the course of 24 h. The evolution of the location of the data neighborhoods serves as a geometric characterization of the biological processes. In contrast to PCA, the visualization characterizes the significant temporal variation in the first 24 h after exposure to the H1N1 pathogen.Another look at this early temporal evolution is shown for Fig. 2 that visualizes the H3N2/DEE2 dataset in the first 24 h after infection using CE on optimized features. Specifically, in this figure we explore the 3D visualization of the controls versus the shedders using Feature Set 3 partition by time interval. In particular, in Fig. 2 the gene expression values of the subjects in Feature Set 3 are shown for the given time interval where their discriminatory capability is at a maximum. This is in contrast to the pathway analysis above were the features were fixed while their expression varied over time.In our final visualization, Fig. 3 displays the entire Feature Set 1 pooled across the four time bins. All the data in the first 32 h from the four H1N1 and H3N2 data sets are mapped to three dimensions using Centroid-Encoder with this pooled feature set. This visualization provides additional validation that our representation has captured discriminatory information related to early infection. Classification rates using these pooled features are discussed in what follows.In summary, this suite of visualizations consistently suggests that there is signficant temporal evolution in gene expression that could permit the classification of shedders in the first 32 h. As a group, they provide a compelling body of evidence to suggest that the biological response to infection is extremely rapid and as such provide visual support for the successful prognosis experiments that follow. In other words, the fact that these low-dimensional visualizations provide clear delineation of the change in gene expression over time serves to validate the machine learning classification results we will present in what follows.Figure 1Visualizations of the \(\alpha \)-\(\beta \) interferon signaling pathway on H1N1 datasets.Full size imageFigure 2Three dimensional visualization of control and shedders using Centroid-Encoder on the H3N2 study (GSE73072/DEE2) which is not used to extract the features.

All of the feature selection algorithms in this paper are based on a modification of the iterative feature removal algorithm based on sparse support vector machines as originally described in14. The resulting discriminatory features are used to build classifiers to predict whether a sample is a shedder, or not. In “Methods”, we discuss a mechanism for ordering the features by their importance for discrimination.The first experiment concerns Feature Set 1 which is obtained by applying time bin feature selection to the four influenza data sets. We perform a LOSO classification on the same data, the influenza studies, using these features. Since the discriminatory features were identified on the same data sets that are then predicted in this experiment, we view this analysis as retrospective. The results in Table 2 show that the feature sets identified are capable of discriminating controls from shedders with high accuracy. The classification experiments were run using LOSO across three different algorithms including linear support vector machines (SVM), an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier and Centroid-Encoder (CE); each technique is described in “Methods”. The non-convex optimization problems, CE and ANN, were each repeated 15 times. Note that the unique SVM solution produces a single average LOSO error. With BSR classification accuracies in the mid- to high-nineties we conclude that Feature Set 1 captures the signals that distinguish controls from eventual shedders for influenza for each time bin. These feature sets can now be mined for biological mechanisms.The next task is to see how the feature sets generalize to prospective data sets. With this in mind we apply Feature Set 1, determined on the influenza data, to the problem of prognosis of the respiratory infections RSV and HRV at different time bins. This classification task is again the discrimination of controls from eventual shedders.Our first test is to use the RSV/DEE1 and HRV/Duke, HRV/UVa data sets individually as prospective datasets; we show the results of this experiment in Table 3. We emphasize that these features were computed on H1N1 and H3N2 data and tested on other respiratory infections. Our visualizations lead us to expect good classification rates in first 8 h time frame and this is indeed the case with nonlinear methods averaging near 90% accuracy. The relatively lower performance for SVM suggests that the boundary separating the controls from the shedders is nonlinear. It appears that HRV and RSV accuracies are comparable suggesting that the classification has more to do with non-pathogen specific aspects of the immune response. The story remains much the same in hours 9–16 but one might infer that the descision boundary for HRV has flattened given the improved performance of the SVM classifier. We see a decrease in the accuracy at 17–24 h for the HRV/Duke dataset. The first significant decline in prediction accuracy is for RSV in the time window 25–32 h. Given the significant biological differences between RSV and influenza, this may now be a pathogen specific response variation.We now explore the impact of merging these HRV and RSV studies to create larger data sets. As shown in Table 4, we see classification results improve with the merged set of HRV/Duke and HRV/UVa as well as with the merged set of all three studies HRV/Duke, HRV/UVA and RSV/DEE1. The BSR classification accuracy of the HRV/(Duke and UVa) averages 90–95% over the four time bins for the best method CE. In contrast to Table 3, here we do see a more uniform reduction in prognosis rates with the inclusion of RSV/DEE1.It is also interesting to explore the predictive value of our models. Recall that positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that subjects classified as \(C^+\) are members of this class while the negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that subjects predicted to be \(C^-\) actually are \(C^-\). Applying CE to the combined HRV data data we find the negative predicitive values of our model to be highly accurate. In summary, for CE applied to HRV we found: Time binPPVNPV1–887.596.779–1694.8397.8517–2484.4895.7025–3282.14100.00In our final experiment for predicting controls from pre-symptomatic shedders we apply Feature Set 2 to the experiment of predicting H3N2/DEE2 influenza. The dataset H3N2/DEE2 was sequestered from the feature selection, i.e., it is prospective. Feature sets were found using IFR on the data without H3N2/DEE2 with Limma batch effect removal using Study ID applied before feature selection. We then compare the performance of the prediction on H3N2/DEE2 using the features selected. The results from this experiment are shown in Table 5. Given there is only one dataset (H3N2/DEE2) being used in this experiment no Limma normalization was used since it was not necessary to correct for batch effects in the prognosis model. The high accuracy provides evidence that the time-dependent feature sets are able to effectively discriminate between shedding and controls in the first 32 h. While these results are promising, the relatively small data set may be responsible for introducing additional variability in the results, particularly for the 17–24 h window where there are only 11 samples associated with shedders and 34 controls. It is also possible that this is the result of the increased complexity of the immune response once more defense mechanisms have been activated. Samples that are roughly 24 h apart may also be harder to discriminate due to circadian rhythm similarities.In the next section, we explore the effect of pooling features. In other words, rather than restricting classification to bins of 8 h intervals, we broaden the bins successively until we collect features from all four time bins as a single feature set.Time pooled prognosis of contagionIn this section, we explore the effectiveness of pooling the feature sets determined as optimal for individual time-intervals. In doing this we gain additional insight into the changes of the host response at different stages of the infection. Combining features over time will indicate how useful the union of discriminatory features is to the overall prognostic question. In the first 8 h, the classification is computed exactly as above, using features identified as optimal for the time bin 1–8 h. The classification in the second 8 h interval now uses the features identified as optimal in the first 8 h combined with those that were identified as optimal in the second 8 h period, or time bin 9–16. We refer to this combined interval using the starting and ending time of the included features, e.g., the union of features from bin 1–8 and bin 9–16 as referred to as bin 1–16. Proceeding in this fashion, the bin labeled 1–32 includes features that comprise the union of all the features that were identified as optimal in each of the first four 8-h time intervals. Classification results on data selected from these time bin intervals are provided where the features are pooled as described above.In this feature pooling experiment we classify the H3N2/DEE2 data set alone using features from the combination of the H1N1, H3N2/DEE5, and HRV, we have omitted RSV given its known dissimilarities with influenza. We refer to the features drawn from these particular studies as Feature Set 3. In Fig. 4, we see the results of applying this pooled approach. A highlight of this graphic is that CE can predict with approximately 84% accuracy that a subject will become a shedder using a pooled set of features from the first 32 h. Perhaps significantly, we conclude that higher accuracies, such as the 95% found when the time bins are known, will require that the machine learning algorithm exploit the temporal evolution of the signatures.Figure 4Balanced success rate (BSR) of LOSO testing applied on the study H3N2/DEE2 using Feature Set 3 pooled by windows. Limma normalization is applied on Study ID. There are a total of training samples 264 and 68 test samples.Full size imageTemporal evolution of biomarkersIn the previous section, we addressed the question of whether biomarkers from different time bins had discriminatory power in other time bins. Here we look at the feature sets themselves and analyze any overlap between features selected for different time bins. In Fig. 5a, we use the Jaccard similarity metric to analyze overlap in Feature Sets 2 and 3 with respect to their different time bins and different limma normalization. In Fig. 5b, we use the same metric and feature sets but the numbers in the figure are the actual number of features in the feature sets.The Jaccard similarity metric of two sets is the number of elements in the intersection of the two sets divided by the number of elements in the union of the two sets21. For example the diagonal in Fig. 5a is 1 since this is the comparison of a set with itself. The only numbers displayed in the top figure are those greater than 0.1 and less than 1. These indicate a small overlap between feature sets. Clusters appear to group based on on time bin for various methods of preprocessing and feature selection, demonstrating some robustness to the process.Analyzing where these areas of overlap occur, several are different feature selection experiments for the same time bin, indicating, for example, Feature Set 3 (with Limma using study ID) at time bin 1–8 has overlap with Feature Set 2 (with Limma using study ID) at the same time bin 1–8. This is unsurprising since the feature sets were drawn from overlapping data sets, but it is worth further consideration if the differing Limma techniques should have resulted in such low overlap.The other areas of overlap, which have to do with our analysis of time dependent features, all occur between the first time bin, hours 1–8, and last, hours 25–32. These are minimal but suggest possible circadian rhythm influence or similar cyclical nature of features selected from pre-symptomatic shedders.Finally we note the lack of overlap between feature sets from time bins 1–8, 9–16, and 17–24. This indicates that the features being drawn are in fact time dependent. Besides not improving classification on different time bins as addressed in the previous section, features drawn in a particular time bin to maximize discrimination between pre-symptomatic shedders and controls have little to no overlap with those in other time bins reinforcing the conclusion that time plays a pivotal role in identifying pre-symptomatic shedders. This validates the feature sets from a modeling prospective moving to the next section we will address the question of whether the feature sets themselves are associated with pathways and genes involved in immune response and viral shedding.Figure 5Comparison and clustering of the sixteen distinct feature sets generated based on different subsets of the data. The similarity matrix used for clustering is based on the Jaccard metric between sets measuring the size of the intersection of two sets divided by the size of the union—which ranges from 0 (no features in common) to 1 (perfect match). (a) Similarity matrix using the Jaccard metric shown. Two strong clusters and a weaker third cluster is seen primarily based on data inclusion, with variation within-cluster based on preprocessing. Rows follow the format “study_preprocessingtime_range”. For instance, “17_24” refers to hours 17–24 after inoculation. (b) The same matrix is shown (same cluster order), but with absolute number of features in common illustrated instead (note most feature sets have 200 features).Full size imageViral shedding is linked to suppressed cellular immunityNow that the validity of features has been assessed through modeling in this section, we assess the validity of the features as biological features associated with viral immune response. To assess the biological significance of the classification signature, we calculated fold gene expression in shedders relative to controls and assessed functional enrichment using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) on Feature Set 2. Viral shedding was associated with an early perturbation in canonical pathways associated to cell cycle regulation, as well as suppressed inflammation and stress responses (Fig. 6A). Although B cell activation was sustained over the first 32 h post-infection, other pathways associated with leukocyte migration and cellular immunity were either not enriched or increasingly suppressed. Natural killer (NK) cell activation and pathways linked to T cell differentiation and effector function were inhibited over time, suggesting that cell-mediated immunity in shedders may be delayed or suppressed.To further investigate the functional implications of these enriched pathways, we used the IPA Upstream Analysis module to identify the predicted activation state of key pathway regulators (Fig. 6B). Predicted upstream regulators demonstrated sustained inhibition of key inflammatory mediators such as mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK, P38 MAPK, ERK1/2), triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\(\beta \) and IL-5, and stress factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1\(\alpha \)(HIF1A). Concurrently, cytokines associated with inflammatory suppression such as transforming growth factor \(\beta \) (TGFB) were predicted to be activated in the first 8 h after infection. Although type I IFN\(\alpha \) was upregulated early, interferon-stimulated genes (ISG; EIF2AK2, STAT3) were inhibited, as were cytokines critical for T cell differentiation (IL-12). Together, functional relationships between genes predicting virus shedding also indicate delayed or suppressed early antiviral responses that allow a productive infection to be established, suggesting a possible mechanism for increased virus replication leading to shedding.Interestingly, we observed an early upregulation of estrogen receptor signaling in virus shedders. Sex hormones are known to regulate inflammation and have a demonstrable impact on influenza virus infection and pathogenesis22,23,24,25,26. Although virus shedding was not specifically associated with sex in these studies, we used the IPA Molecule Activity Prediction analysis module to investigate the relationship between several significantly enriched functional categories in the classifier signature (phagocytosis, phagocyte migration, inflammatory response, and virus replication) and estrogen secretion (Fig. 6). We observed that, phagocytosis, phagocyte migration, and inflammatory responses were predicted to be inhibited, consistent with our findings in both the pathway and upstream regulator analyses. Virus replication was predicted to be activated, as was estrogen secretion. Previously, estrogen was shown to protect mice against severe influenza by reducing inflammation24 and reducing recruitment of inflammatory cells to the respiratory tract26. These observations are consistent with our findings showing a relationship between estrogen signaling and reduced inflammatory signaling and immune cell migration, that allow for increased viral replication and shedding even in subjects with mild disease such as those in this study.Figure 6Biological function of molecules associated with virus shedding.

The feature selection analysis indicates a strong time-dependence of the optimal discriminatory features, e.g., features that are discriminatory on the first 8 h may not be useful in day 2. We provide visual evidence that the shedders and non-shedders can be discriminated in multiple scenarios. First, the \(\alpha \)-\(\beta \) interferon pathway, a functional pathway known to be induced in response to viral infection, clearly shows the differences in the temporal evolution of the shedders versus non-shedders. The temporal evolution of the pathway creates a biological signature that carves out a nonlinear trajectory in gene-space that undergoes an excursion that approximately returns to normal overs the course of infection. This excursion corresponds to the host immune response for shedders, while non-shedders have trajectories that remain in the general vicinity of the health state. A nonlinear visualization of this pathway illustrates a rapid departure from the health state in the first 8 h. In the machine learning experiments the features identified from retrospective studies are effectively exploited to build models of prognosis that lead to accurate predictions of shedding on prospective data in the first 32 h. The best model achieves approximately 95% accuracy in the first 8 h and 90–95% over the first 32 h. In addition, we have shown we are able to distinguish pre-symptomatic shedders from controls in the first 32 h after infection based on pooled features with over 80% accuracy. We found that the NPV predictions of our approach are especially strong and further exploration is required to understand how to improve PPVs.The machine learning models trained on 8 h intervals and subsequent feature analysis allowed us to demonstrate the temporal evolution of the sets of the most discriminating features. This approach has the potential to elucidate the time-evolving biological processes more quantitatively; we have only attempted a preliminary exploration of this. The pooled analysis suggests an important conclusion, namely, that the best classification models will exploit time dependence.The scope of the analysis in this paper is restricted to the study of pre-symptomatic shedders and controls in the first 32 h. This data selection allowed us to address the important question concerning prognosis at the earliest states of infection, even before the subjects reported feeling ill. Further, we were able to establish that the data indeed has predictive signatures in contrast to preceding analyses, all of which failed to predict shedding in the first 24 h. As described in27, 15 different models failed to produce predictions in the viral shedding challenge better than random, possibly due to overfitting. We feel the success our predictive models in this investigation is a consequence of a focus on feature selection using a carefully implemented SSVM with iterative feature removal, followed by a novel classification tool that outperforms several widely used methods. We have also used validation data to guide our parameter selection and sequestered test data during the feature selection process in order to minimize problems associated with overfitting.A biological analysis of the feature sets used in the machine learning experiments were seen to be significant showing estrogen signaling and reduced inflammatory signaling and immune cell migration in shedders. The early suppression of inflammatory responses suggests that shedding may be associated with delayed antiviral host responses that allow the infection to become established rather than rapidly cleared by host defenses, leading to productive replication and shedding of infectious virions. The link to estrogen signaling is intriguing, particularly since sex-biased features of clinical influenza disease has been directly linked to estrogen and progesterone22,23,24,25,26. Further studies should investigate the role of sex hormones in determining the extent of shedding and if sex is a predictive factor for transmission.While it is true that influenza A virus, RSV, and HRV are all taxonomically, genomically, structurally, and functionally distinct. They have unique tropism, use different receptors for entry, and have different mechanisms for viral genome replication, interferon antagonism, virion assembly, and egress. They also can induce virus-specific global host response profiles and result in differentially severe clinical disease and epidemiologic features. However, despite their many differences, these viruses do have many shared features, as well. They primarily infect and cause disease in the respiratory tract, are transmitted by the same routes, and notably cause asymptomatic or presymptomatic shedding in some infected persons. Although many different viral families have evolved singular approaches for replicating in the respiratory tract, these often involve common host machinery and elicit identical host response profiles, even in genetically diverse populations that are often highly variable, such as humans. Therefore, while they can be clearly extricated based on their differences, they can also be studied based on their similarities. In this case, we have focused on identifying common markers of shedding that apply across diverse respiratory pathogens in human hosts. This has substantial utility for diagnosing respiratory virus infections or predicting viral shedding based on these shared responses, where often the specific virus causing the infection is not known or cannot be rapidly determined.This investigation ignores the possibility of co-infections. Delayed antiviral responses do likely allow many different types of viruses to establish a productive infection, leading to downstream shedding, and in some cases, disease. In this scenario, it would be possible for multiple viruses to establish a co-infection and for shedding of several different viruses. Indeed, this is thought to be the setting in which influenza reassortment occurs, which results in the shedding of reassortant progeny. We were not able to investigate this here, however, as the data used did not include co-infected individuals.We have included four complementary machine learning tools including support vector machines (SVMs), sparse SVMs, artificial neural network (ANNs) classifiers and the supervised data reduction algorithm Centroid-Encoder. SVMs have the advantage that they are convex optimization problems and hence are fast and produce solutions that are globally optimal. The sparse penalty for SVM allows one to select features in the challenging setting where the number of variables (20000) is significantly larger than the number of data points without an ad hoc parameter. SVM is then applied using the resulting reduced feature set; note that in the absence of this feature reduction the problem would be mathematically under-determined and there would be an infinity of meaningless solutions. Centroid-Encoder simultaneously provides a mechanism for supervised visualization and the top performing classifier across a diverse array of methods. ANNs are used as a benchmark to compare the results of SVMs and CEs; they are widely used and provide a useful benchmarking tool. Lastly, we note that SVMs in general work well with relatively small data sets, e.g., 50–100 samples, while ANNs are viewed as data hungry. The fact that the nonlinear methods performed well, without global minima, provides strong evidence that there is enough data with enough signal to build neural network models in this investigation. These approaches may be used together as a general tool to interrogate the data for patterns and signatures related to different biological questions of interest beyond what has been explored here, e.g., shedding versus non-shedding in symptomatic individuals.Finally, the experiments in this investigation could benefit from more samples. There have recently been additional sequencing studies on human clinical blood samples related to the host response to infection by respiratory viruses that will serve to enhance and validate the work presented here.MethodsExperimentsIn all experiments we employed leave one subject out (LOSO) cross validation and repeated the trials 15 times using both Subject ID and Study ID.Experiment workflowThe workflow of our machine learning experiments follows these steps: 1. data partitioning 2. data normalization 3. feature selection using iterative feature removal, a technique based on sparse support vector machines 4. classification on retrospective and prospective data using a SVM, ANN and CE classifiers 5. evaluation of classification accuracy using balanced success rate (BSR) 6. functional analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) Data partitioningHere we summarize how the data was partitioned for the various experiments. We computed features on each of the four time bins in the first 32 h using to produce Feature Set 1: IFR applied to four influenza data sets including all H1N1 and H3N2 samples. The feature counts were 136, 38, 200 and 60 for the time-bins normalized with subject ID while the feature counts were 300, 97 500 and 200 for the time-bins normalized by study ID. Feature Set 2: IFR applied to H1N1 (both sets), H3N2/DEE5, HRV (both sets), and RSV. All the feature counts for Feature Set 2 were of size 200 with the exception of the time bin 25–32 h which had 130 features for subject ID normalization and 145 features for study ID normalization. Feature Set 3: IFR applied to H1N1 (both sets), H3N2/DEE5, and HRV (both sets). All the feature counts for Feature Set 3 were of size 200. Each feature set has subsets associated with the time bins. We see that many of the bins were determined by an arbitrary capping of the number of features when there was no clear cut off. This ad hoc approach did not seem to significantly impact the results.NormalizationAll microarray data is normalized at the beginning using a typical RMA normalization method12. The data utilized is incorporated from multiple studies and so batch effects are inevitable due to a variety of factors, including study location, the year and time of year of experiments, and procedures for processing samples for their expression values, to name a few. We employ a simple linear normalization process using either Study ID, or Subject ID and the well-known Limma process13. Additional details related to normalization are in the Supplementary Materials 1.Feature selectionEach sample has approximately 22,000 microarray probe set identification components, or features. Using entire feature sets tends to induce overfitting and poor generalization, so our work emphasizes data reduction through optimal feature selection. Our philosophy is rooted in the idea of extracting all discriminatory features and so we use the iterative feature removal (IFR) procedure developed in14.The first step, in the feature selection process, is to identify the classes that we are proposing to discriminate. In this paper we limit the scope of the machine learning to the pre-symptomatic shedders versus pre-infection samples, or controls. Further, we partition the data by 8 h time windows. So, an example of a machine learning experiment in this paper considers controls versus shedders in time bin 1–8 h. Given these two classes, the next step is to identify a minimal set of discriminatory features using a sparse support vector classifier on a training data set informed by the balanced success rate accuracy (BSR) on a validation set. These features are then removed and a new sparse classifier is trained, again observing the error on the validation set as a stopping criterion. This process is repeated until the BSR on the validation set falls below a tolerance, e.g, \(75 \%\). At this point we have a collection of all the discriminatory features associated with the data for the given data partitioning. The process is then repeated on 30 trials with different partitions. We record the frequency with which each feature is selected over the 30 trials with the idea that the significance of a feature is related to this frequency. A top fraction of the most frequently occurring features are then reordered based on the absolute magnitude of the weights. Now we create classifiers based on the resulting feature set. The accuracy plots for the ranked feature sets are presented in the Supplementary material 1.As part of the IFR feature selection process, we use a stratified-4-fold cross validation, with test balanced success rate cutoff set to 0.5 with 50 repetitions and limit the number of iterations of IFR to 70. In any given model we retain the features selected until their is a weight ratio that exceeds 5 or a weight magnitude drops below 1e−6. For each data partition we cap the number of features that can be selected at 80% of the size of the training data. Additional details are described in the Supplementary Materials 1.ClassifiersOnce a collection of features has been selected using sparse support vector machine based iterative feature, we build classifiers using linear support vector machines, Artificial Neural Networks and Centroid-Encoder. We describe each of these methods briefly below and direct the reader to the references for further details. 1. Linear28,29,30 and Sparse14,31,32,33 support vector machines (SVMs). In this paper we use linear SVMs for building classification models based on the features determined by sparse SVM (SSVM) Iterative Feature Removal14. The classical linear SVM objective function is $$\begin{aligned} \min _{\mathbf {x},b} ||\mathbf {w}||_2 + C \sum _{i=1}^n \xi _i \end{aligned}$$ (1) The sparse support vector machine (SSVM) is obtained by replacing the \(\ell _2\)-norm with the \(\ell _1\)-norm: $$\begin{aligned} \min _{\mathbf {x},b} ||\mathbf {w}||_1 + C \sum _{i=1}^n \xi _i \end{aligned}$$ (2) subject to the same set of constraints. The sparsity promoting \(\ell _1\) formulation (2) can be expressed as a linear programming problem, which in turn can be solved using any number of standard algorithms; we apply a primal-dual interior point method34. Note that SVMs in various forms have a long history related to the analysis of gene expression data28,30,35. 2. Artificial Neural Networks: We apply a standard feed-forward neural network trained with one-hot-encoding to learn the labels of the training data . In all the classification tasks, we used two hidden layers with 200 ReLU activation in each layer. We used the whole training set to calculate the gradient of the error function (cross-entropy) while updating the network parameters using Scaled Conjugate Gradient Descent(SCG) see36 during error backpropagation. 3. Centroid-Encoder. This is a variation of an autoencoder which can be used for both visualization and classification purposes. Consider a data set with N samples and M classes. The classes denoted \(C_j, j = 1, \dots , M\) where the indices of the data associated with class \(C_j\) are denoted \(I_j\). We define centroid of each class as \(c_j=\frac{1}{|C_j|}\sum _{i \in I_j} x^i\) where \(|C_j|\) is the cardinality of class \(C_j\). Unlike autoencoder, which maps each point \(x^i\) to itself, Centroid-Encoder will map each point \(x^i\) to its class centroid \(c_j\) by minimizing the following cost function over the parameter set \(\theta \): $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} \mathcal {L}_{ce}(\theta )=\frac{1}{2N}\sum ^M_{j=1} \sum _{i \in I_j}\Vert c_j-f(x^i; \theta ))\Vert ^2_2 \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (3) The mapping f is composed of a dimension reducing mapping g (encoder) followed by a dimension increasing reconstruction mapping h (decoder). The output of the encoder is used as a supervised visualization tool, and attaching another layer to map to the one-hot encoded labels and further training by fine-tuning provides a classifier. For further details, see19. We use SCG36 to update the network parameters during error backpropagation. Functional analysisNormalized array data was used to calculate expression of classifier genes from shedders relative to control samples. Log2 expression ratios were uploaded to Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (QIAGEN Bioinformatics) and analyzed using the IPA Core Analysis function. No expression or significance thresholds were applied to the classifier genes. ReferencesIp, D. K. et al.

It spread rapidly through schools and military camps, particularly afflicting those under 25, before becoming a global pandemic which lasted two years, reaching the UK, and eventually the US. In total, it is thought to have killed around 700,000 people around the globe. But when virologists began to study the so-called ‘Russian flu’, they noticed something highly unusual about the virus’ genetic sequence. It looked almost identical to a strain which had last been seen in the 1950s.“Viruses evolve very, very quickly,” says Joel Wertheim, an associate professor of medicine at the University of California San Diego, who has studied the Russian flu outbreak. “If you gave me a flu virus, I could, within a pretty narrow range, tell you what year it came from, and the strain which began circulating in 1977 looks exactly like one in 1950. Now, there’s no place in nature for influenza to hide out and not mutate, the only place where it doesn’t mutate is the freezer.”To Wertheim and others, it was pretty obvious that the 1977 outbreak had not originated in the wild. In 2004, the virologist Peter Palese wrote that a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences had told him that the reintroduction of H1N1 was thought to be the result of vaccine challenge trials involving several thousand military recruits. Although the origins of the pandemic are still unknown, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has rejected the idea that H1N1 was a product of a laboratory accident.Still, lab accidents do happen. The virus which caused the original Sars outbreak in 2003, has since escaped from virology labs on six separate occasions, in Singapore, Taiwan and Beijing.Over the past year, Wertheim’s work on the Russian flu has been the subject of renewed interest. While the initial scientific consensus was that the Covid-19 pandemic had a natural origin, speculation has grown over the past year regarding whether the Sars-CoV-2 virus could possibly have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a lab which was studying nine of its closest viral relatives at the time.These questions have been fuelled by China’s reluctance to fully cooperate with outside investigators, even those from the WHO, and share critical information. In an editorial for the journal Nature, members of the WHO team investigating the origin of the pandemic warned that time is running out to conduct tests that might help identify how Covid-19 began. Reports have also continued to emerge which detail odd behaviour from Wuhan scientists, both before, and in the earliest stages of the pandemic.Most PopularGearThe Best Flashlights and Headlamps to Light Up Your LifeBy Martin CizmarGearThe Best Android Phones, Tested and ReviewedBy Julian ChokkattuGear27 Gifts for the Best Mom You KnowBy Nena Farrell Gear17 Gifts for People Who Just Need a Good Night's SleepBy Jess GreyIn September 2019, the Wuhan lab abruptly took a database of more than 22,000 pathogen samples offline. Then in early 2020, it first uploaded, and then subsequently deleted, 13 genome sequences from a US government database. These sequences were from some of the earliest cases of Covid-19 to have been detected in Wuhan.“I think it’s suspicious,” says Alina Chan, a researcher at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University, who has been one of the most vocal voices calling for the need to investigate the possibility of a lab leak. “They did not put it anywhere else, and refused to respond to comments. So if it had been taken down for an innocuous reason, why wouldn’t they respond to people who reached out and said, ‘What did you do with the data?’”Chan’s own scientific detective work has provided increasing traction to the theory that Covid-19 might have had a non-natural origin. In May 2020, she published a provocative paper, based on early genetic sequences of people infected with the virus. It claimed that SARS-CoV-2 was unusually well placed to invade the human body when it first came to attention in December 2019.Investigations of what had been taking place at the Wuhan lab over the past decade have only continued to stoke the fire. There have been reports that scientists at the institute were conducting controversial and high-risk ‘gain-of-function’ experiments which attempt to modify a natural virus to make it more infectious or virulent, in order to give virologists a head-start on tackling dangerous pathogens of the future.However, all of this is still nowhere near enough proof that the Covid-19 pandemic began with SARS-CoV-2 escaping from the Wuhan institute. To begin with, there is still no evidence that the virus ever passed through the lab, and not all scientists agree that early samples of the virus display particularly unusual characteristics.“This virus was not exceptionally adapted to humans upon arrival,” says Wertheim. “This was not some perfectly adapted strain, this was a virus that has got a lot better at infecting humans and transmitting between humans since it arrived. We know this because we've seen it adapt since early on, and the rise of further variants in the past year.”Most PopularGearThe Best Flashlights and Headlamps to Light Up Your LifeBy Martin CizmarGearThe Best Android Phones, Tested and ReviewedBy Julian ChokkattuGear27 Gifts for the Best Mom You KnowBy Nena Farrell Gear17 Gifts for People Who Just Need a Good Night's SleepBy Jess GreyFor scientists to be really convinced that the pandemic was started by a lab leak, Wertheim says there would need to be concrete evidence that the Wuhan lab had been holding a virus which matched the genetic sequence of Sars-CoV-2 partially or in full, or epidemiological data connecting some of the earliest transmission clusters to the institute.But proving the opposite theory – that Sars-CoV-2 spilled over from the wild – is just as hard. Both the Sars and Mers outbreaks, caused by similar coronaviruses, were traced back to intermediary animal hosts – palm civets in the case of Sars, and dromedary camels in the case of Mers – which were in close contact with humans, helping the virus cross the animal-human barrier. However, while tens of thousands of animals have been tested over the past eighteen months, the search for the intermediary host of SARS-CoV-2 has been an elusive one so far.Again, evidence has emerged that China has hindered efforts on this front. While data given to the WHO from the Chinese government suggested that only snakes, crocodiles and salamanders were being sold live in Wuhan’s wet markets, a new paper published last month revealed that in reality, 38 different species – from civet cats to raccoon dogs – were being sold between May 2017 and November 2019. “Those animals were never disclosed to the WHO in their investigation,” says Wertheim. “So there was never the opportunity to test the most relevant animals.”Chan believes that one of the reasons why crucial information has been withheld is because China is trying to push its own narrative of how the pandemic began. “China has its own preferred origin scenarios,” she says. “These involve either the virus emerging from frozen meat, or emerging in multiple countries at the same time. Neither one of these is either scientifically plausible I think, but it does move the blame outside of China.”But while such political sensitivities have obscured the quest to solve the mystery of how Covid-19 began, scientists have made some progress when it comes to determining when exactly the pandemic started. Knowing this timeframe is crucial to pinpointing where and how the virus emerged in humans, whether from animals or the Wuhan lab.Most PopularGearThe Best Flashlights and Headlamps to Light Up Your LifeBy Martin CizmarGearThe Best Android Phones, Tested and ReviewedBy Julian ChokkattuGear27 Gifts for the Best Mom You KnowBy Nena Farrell Gear17 Gifts for People Who Just Need a Good Night's SleepBy Jess GreyLast month, one scientist managed to reconstruct the 13 genome sequences which were deleted by the Wuhan lab early on in the pandemic, after discovering that the removed files were still stored in Google Cloud. His analysis – which has not been released in a peer-reviewed journal – provided evidence to suggest that Covid-19 actually began in October or even earlier.“I wouldn’t be surprised if we get more data which pushes it back a few months before that,” says Sergei Pond, a biology professor at Temple University in Pennsylvania who has also been studying some of the earliest Sars-CoV-2 genetic sequences. “And that's always true for every epidemic, because by the time we realise that something's wrong, it's been going on for several months.”But there is a limit to how much such forensic analysis can tell us. If we are ever to truly understand the origins of Covid-19, some major new revelations would be required. Because China is unlikely to cooperate with the rest of the world anytime soon when it comes to vital data-sharing, some scientists have already accepted that it is likely to be a mystery that is never solved.“My personal view is that we will not have a full consensus on the origin of it all,” says Pond. “You're going to have people that continue to insist that it was a lab release, but you can’t prove that definitively without eyewitness testimony or documentation, and it’s hard to imagine that even existing, let alone getting into the public domain. So I think we just have to continue with the assumption that this is a spillover from the wild.”However, Chan believes that if China is hiding some dark secrets about how Covid-19 began, they will ultimately come to light in years to come, once the immediate crisis has subsided, and it becomes safer for any potential whistleblowers to talk. “At the moment, anyone who knows any secret information will be too worried to speak,” she says. “But when time passes, it becomes safer for people to come and say something about what actually happened.”More great stories from WIRED💼 Sign-up to WIRED’s business briefing: Get Work SmarterA radical plan to treat Covid’s mental health falloutApple and Google still have a problem with LGBTQ appsThe UK is about to hit its Covid vaccine ceilingThey wanted big balls.

Diabetic Patients At Higher Risk of Developing Severe Influenza Symptoms, Doctor Warns Written by Satata Karmakar |Published : August 27, 2021 5:50 PM IST India is known as the capital of diabetes. According to the statistics, the country is home to more than 77 million adults who are living with this severe health condition. Diabetes is usually characterised as a chronic (long-lasting) health condition which hinders the body's mechanisms of turning food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) this gets released in the bloodstream. A sudden increase or a sharp spike in this glucose level in the blood is what is known as 'diabetes'. There are several symptoms of this chronic health condition, such as frequent urination, extreme fatigue, always hungry for food, dry and rough skin, unexplained weight loss, etc. but, did you know Diabetes can also increase your chances of experiencing severe side effects of other major health complications? Yes, you read that right. In a recent study, experts have stated that a diabetes patient is at much higher risk of influenza diseases than others. Today, we have with us Dr. Altamash Shaikh, Consultant Endocrinologist, Diabetologist and Metabolic Superspecialist, Masina Hospital to tell us about how and why a diabetic patient is known to be at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms of influenza. Read on to find out everything.Why do people with diabetes have a higher risk of getting Influenza? Hello Doc! I have been getting recurrent coughs and colds since ever and am concerned about more issues,asI have got to know am suffering from diabetes. This is usual story of a person with diabetes on the background of allergies. Not just this, even without any history of allergies, people with diabetes do have a higher risk of getting the viral flu: influenza flu,the pneumococcal pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis and other infectious problems. This is primarily due to the weakened immune system that ,ay occur as a result of high blood glucose, Diabetes. On the other hand , simple flu may also make worsen the diabetes control. Also, any short term or acute illness may cause it difficult to achieve diabetes control. This holds true for all people with diabetes (whether type1, type2, gestational , etc).Thus,in a nutshell, influenza is a highly contagious respiratory illness, and people with diabetes have a 3 to 6 times more chances to get hospitalised apart fromhaving higher risk of getting more sick. Notably, there is a higher risk of death associated with influenza infection inpeople with diabetes. Every flu season is different, and influenza infection can affect differently in all. So, the though in many of diabetes patients that how do we then protect ourselves from this influenza. Also Read Can H3N2 Influenza Virus Cause Sleeplessness? Explains Dr Bandana MishraUS Witnesses An Uptick In Influenza And COVID-19 Infections, CDC Warns Of More Cases57-Year-Old Man Dies Of Swine Flu While Undergoing Treatment: Officials Say People With Comorbidities Are At Risk More News The good news is that, we do have some important preventative measures to reduce the severity of recurrent influenza attack, by administering, the influenza vaccine. Are Vaccines effective? If yes, does high sugar levels causes hindrance? Yes! You got it right. Vaccine for influenza are effective.Influenza commonly leads to complications amongst people with diabetes, so vaccination is highly recommended. Flu vaccine reduce disease, disability, severity and chances of death. These vaccine are having long term established safety in people with diabetes. Flu shots or flu vaccines are important as people with diabetes are high risk of getting flu complications. There are different types of vaccine available for influenza. Flu vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body about 2 weeks after vaccination. These flu shots are annual or ofyearlyin diabetes. You may like to read In some people flu shot due to pain may temporarily spike glucose levels, and one may require few days of short changes in diabetes medicines. This reponse to pain is similar to other types of pain eg, injury or any injection. No need to worry too much about this, it's a easy pie. Also, it is advisable to keep blood glucose under control if in case just before the shot your blood glucose levels are high. No hinderance once the diabetes levels are in control, you may take your flu shot. Care to be taken to keep influenza at bay, especially when you are diabetic? Mass awareness of symptoms of influenza in adults is vital. People with diabetes have a higher risk than people without diabetes,to have infectious diseases and to be admitted to hospital, as well as a higher risk of death. Hence, you should know the followingsymptoms of breathlessness, pressure or chest pain, giddiness, muscle pain, weakness, fever or cough, fever may improve and then worsen, along with worsening of diabetes control. It is of great significance to be vigilant of such warning signs of flu and report to medical system. Another important thing that is advised to people with diabetes is to change to preventive behaviour in daily life. For example, washing hands, covering coughs, avoiding people who are sick to reduce their chances of acquiring flu from diseased person. One must follow these too when infected: Continue taking your insulin and diabetes pills as usual. Test your blood glucose and keep track of the results, warm soups, steam inhalation, maintain record of temperature with thermometer, drink plenty of water. Influenza has a huge impact on the life course of people with diabetes. It is preventable by taking simple housekeeping rules and by getting the yearly flu shots. These small steps of care and discussion between you and your endocrinologist helps to keep influenzaat bay.

I am Carolien van de Sandt and I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology in the Kedzierska laboratory. I am originally from the Netherlands and I undertook my PhD at the University of Rotterdam studying immunity against influenza viruses and more specifically the so called CD8 “killer” T cells. What brought you to the Doherty Institute? My PhD focused on basic immunology and virology, understanding the interaction between the virus and the immune system, if and how the immune system can recognize multiple influenza strains and how viruses escape from the immune response. However, I was very keen to understand why people respond differently to viral infections, especially across different age groups. School-aged children tend to respond really well to a range of viruses, but very young children can get quite sick. The same when you get older, after the age of 65 you have a higher chance of getting a severe infection from respiratory like influenza and COVID-19. I always wanted to understand the logical reasons for this observation. Why is that old people are less able to cope with these infections while children seem to benefit from this superior immune response. That is why I joined the Kedzierska laboratory in 2018, to work on a human ageing project to study how CD8+ T cells developed across a human’s lifespan. I want to not only understand how the immune system develops over time, but also how we can harness the optimal immune response to benefit all age groups. You’ve just been awarded the 2022 Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Research Award. Tell us about that. It’s a three-year grant valued $438,712 to continue my studies into understanding the aging process of the immune system. In our previous study, we were able to show that the changing immune response was to do in part with T cell receptors expressed on the surface of CD8+ killer T cells. T cell receptors play an important role in recognising influenza virus infected cells. We were able to show that the composition of these receptors undergoes important changes as we age. The most optimal T cell receptors appear during early childhood, are maintained into adulthood, but begin to wane as you get older. I now want to look at where these optimal receptors come from and how these receptors get ‘educated’ to recognise infected cells and attack them. Is the reason we why we lose our ability to fight viruses as we get older, due to our inability to recognise them anymore? We have set up a large cohort of human samples from people of all ages. We have core blood samples from umbilical cords, so babies who have never been exposed to the influenza virus and have completely naive immune systems; children who have first influenza virus infection; adults who have seen many infections; and elderly individuals. The education process the T cell receptors go through happens in a special organ called the thymus. This organ teaches T cell receptors to recognise the difference between healthy ‘self’ cells and virus infected cells they need to attack. In the coming years I will study if and how this teaching process changes over human lifespan, which could affect our body’s ability to combat influenza and other viral pathogens. Is the reason our immune system wanes, due to the fact we lose the ability to educate these receptors? What to next? My ultimate goal is to find a way to stimulate the optimum immune response we see in children and young adults so we can improve an individual’s immunity throughout their entire lifespan. If you indeed lose your ability to train yourself, could there be a way to circumvent this? Can you maintain the previously trained cells for a longer period of time so you don’t lose you optimal immunity? Or is there a way to train them without the thymus? We are just about to entering our fourth week of lockdown in Melbourne, any tips for getting through it? Well I actually only recently got back from a year in the Netherland, where I spent almost the whole year in lockdown! And I arrived back in Melbourne just in time to go into this lockdown, so I have a bit of experience. I am lucky that for the most part I still get to go into work in the lab and see colleagues, so for me it’s the social interactions outside work I am really missing. But on the other hand, it is a good time to catch up on some of my hobbies for which I normally do not have much time, like painting and reading.

Past Pandemics Devastated the U.S. Military, Teaching Lethal LessonsAugust 27, 2021|in Newsroom | David Goldstein“Spanish Flu” is a misnomer. It got the name because Spain, which was neutral in the war, was the first country to report on the outbreak because it had no military censorship. Other countries kept a wrap on news of the pandemic for fear of raising concerns while it had troops on the battlefield. Experts believe the virus actually showed up initially in the American Midwest, in Haskell County, Kansas, an agricultural region. It unleashed the beginnings of what became the first of three waves in March 1918. Soldiers from Haskell County went to Camp Funston, a part of Fort Riley, to train. Health experts believe they infected others. As troops from the camp were sent to other military installations across the country, the virus went with them, infecting even greater numbers. A 1917 photograph of Camp Syracuse, a recruit camp outside Syracuse, New York, shows Onondaga Lake in the background. In 1918, 2,900 of the 12,000 soldiers at Camp Syracuse developed influenza, and 208 died. The virus spread from the camp to Syracuse itself where 900 people died in the fall of 1918. Photo courtesy of New York National Guard. It was an opportunistic disease. It chose no side in the conflict. As American soldiers were sent overseas, they infected Allied and German troops alike, as well as civilians. The military had a public health emergency on its hands with few tools to fight it. Unlike now, there was no vaccine to inoculate the troops and the larger public against the virus. On Aug. 23, the FDA announced that it approved the first COVID-19 vaccine—saying it “meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved vaccine,” according to acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock—and the military sprang into action. “Now that the Pfizer vaccine has been approved, the department is prepared to issue guidance requiring all service members to be vaccinated,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday. A timeline will be available soon. READ MOREBurn Pits—The Military’s Next Agent Orange Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he will seek a waiver from the president to make the vaccines mandatory for service members by mid-September, according to Military Times. So far, about one million are fully vaccinated, with about 222,000 service members contracting the disease and 34 service members dying from it, according to the Defense Department. With hospitals throughout the country becoming overwhelmed with unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, it was no surprise when the Biden administration this month mandated that every member of the armed forces be given the shots. “Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is a key force protection and readiness issue,” Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a statement. In 1918, the military would have done just about anything for a vaccine: During World War I, when the United States and its allies battled both the Germans and the devastating Spanish flu, the flu wreaked deadly havoc. More than 116,000 American servicemen were killed during the war. But as bloody as the conflict was, with never-before-seen carnage from machine guns, mines, artillery, and poison gas, diseases—largely the Spanish Flu—took the greater toll. The flu was responsible for more than 63,000 deaths, compared to around 53,000 caused by combat. Nearly 30,000 troops died before their boots even hit European soil, says Carol Byerly, a military medical historian and author of several books about infectious diseases. “They were pretty helpless against influenza,” she tells The War Horse. America needed a healthy army and navy as the smoke of battle hung over Europe. By the fall of 1918, military physicians ordered troops to wear masks and practice social distancing, just as they do today. They experimented with medicines, though with little success.

But more than two decades after the armistice, as another world war gripped the globe, many of the military’s senior officers who had fought in the first world war remembered how devastating the Spanish Flu had been and how it had undermined America’s efforts. The U.S. Army set up a commission to develop a flu vaccine. It partnered with academia and industry to produce other disease treatments, as well. “The military, more than most sectors of society, understands how important it is to keep a population vaccinated because that is how you are ready to fight and defend your country,” Byerly says. At the outset of the “Great War” in 1914, the world looked very different. National boundaries and alliances were not what they are today, and nationalism was on the rise. Old monarchies teetered. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, by a Bosnia-Serb nationalist in 1914 became the match that lit the flame.

The United States, which had been on the sidelines, entered the war in 1917 after a series of German attacks on American shipping. A deadly pandemic was not on anyone’s radar. The world had experienced influenza outbreaks before, but nothing like the virus that spread across the globe in 1918, “one of the most lethal pandemics of the Modern Age,” according to the National Institutes of Health. One-third of the world’s population was infected, leaving at least 50 million dead, with 675,000 in the United States alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Infection. Pneumonia was the primary cause of death. By comparison, the COVID-19 pandemic has killed more than 4.4 million people worldwide, including more than 620,000 Americans, according to the World Health Organization. The military became particularly susceptible. Bases coast to coast crowded with recruits let the virus hopscotch around the country. Every Army training camp reported infections. Cramped troop ships ferrying soldiers across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe to fight Germany and its allies became breeding grounds for infection. The battlefield trenches, where conditions were anything but sanitary, became hotbeds of disease. Cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever were common. Poor nutrition was rampant. Field hospitals up and down the Western Front became overwhelmed. In the fall of 1918, as the flu virus mounted its deadly second wave, the Army’s acting surgeon general, Brig. Gen. Charles Richard, pressed Army Chief of Staff General Peyton March to impose a quarantine on troops before they boarded ships bound for Europe and to reduce the crowding in hopes of checking the spread of infection. But March also felt pressure from Gen. John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force, who wanted more men. A New York City mailman goes about his business while wearing a gauze mask designed to stop infection during the fall of 1918. U.S. Army units mobilizing for World War I were struck hard by the virus, which often hit military bases first and then spread to civilians. Camp Upton on Long Island was closed to visitors in the fall of 1918 to prevent the spread of the flu. Photo courtesy New York National Guard. In a conversation with President Woodrow Wilson, March argued against a slowdown and Wilson agreed. The soldier who died from the virus, March said, “has just as surely played his part as his comrade who has died in France.” Wilson himself later contracted the Spanish Flu while in Paris for peace negotiations in 1919. Accounts at the time said the president was not the same after his illness. Months later he suffered a mini stroke. Physicians identified the bacteria causing many of the deaths. But without antibiotics, which were not fully developed until the 1930s, they “could do little more than provide palliative care of warmth, rest, and a gentle diet, and hope that their patients did not develop pneumonia,” Byerly wrote in a report for NIH. Military physicians experimented with several therapies to treat the bacteria. The U.S. Army Medical School produced and distributed two million doses of an experimental drug in October and November of 1918, according to a 2015 article in Armed Forces & Society, which publishes peer-reviewed academic research. “The military environment was seen as an optimal setting in which to test the viability of an influenza vaccine, given the large number of test subjects (the enlisted), the controlled environment, large case numbers, and sophisticated reporting regimes,” wrote the authors, Christopher Watterson and Adam Kamradt-Scott. But because vaccines were still more an idea than a reality and the cause of the flu remained unknown, “no conclusive results … could be attained. The net result from the failed trials meant that medical personnel often found themselves powerless to prevent the spread and lethality of the disease.” Capt. Shamira Conerly, 149th Medical Group, shows Master Sgt. David Romero, 149th Maintenance Squadron, the vaccine dose he will receive at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas, March 18, 2021.

At Camp McClellan in Alabama, since renamed Fort McClellan, “Military authorities also attempted to prevent the spread of infection by keeping buildings clean, airing out tents and bedding daily, exposing troops to fresh air, and keeping recovering patients isolated for an additional ten days,” wrote Kathleen M. Fargey, a historian with the U.S. Army Center of Military History, in the spring 2019 issue of Army History. “Units which seemed prone to illness were sprayed with chemical agents in an attempt at decontamination.” But the rapid, unrelenting spread of the contagion became almost overwhelming. Dr. Victor Vaughn, dean of the University of Michigan School of Medicine at the time, was no stranger to the debilitating effect of disease, having seen how typhoid fever laid soldiers low during the Spanish-American War. As head of the communicable diseases section of the surgeon general’s office, he visited Camp Devens near Boston during the virus’s second wave in the fall of 1918. “I see hundreds of young, stalwart men in the uniform of their country coming into the wards of the hospital in groups of ten or more,” he wrote afterward. “They are placed on the cots until every bed is full and yet others crowd in. The faces soon bore a bluish cast; a distressing cough brings up the blood-stained sputum. In the morning the dead bodies are stacked about the morgue like cordwood.” Team members of the Belvoir Hospital’s 7 Medical/Telemetry Unit prepare for the start of a new day in April 2020. The unit converted many of its daily operations to care for patients admitted for COVID-19 infections. Photo by Reese Brown, courtesy of the Defense Department. A hospital report around that same time from Camp Meade, near Baltimore, noted the virus’s stunning infection rate. “The hospital, which was accustomed to admitting between 50 and 70 new cases daily, was suddenly admitting hundreds, as many as 875 being admitted in a single day (Sept. 28, 1918),” the report stated. “Instead of 900 to 1,000 patients to care for, the wards of the hospital were suddenly filled with 3,000.” Our Journalism Depends on Your Support HiddenOur journalism depends on your support. Though the military didn’t have the tools that modern medicine has used to thwart the current pandemic, it understood that whether now or a century ago, a strong public health system with clear lines of leadership was crucial to the response. “That’s what the Army has been able to have,” Byerly says. “To see people say public health needs to be handled at the local level, that’s not the way the virus sees it. The Army understands that these germs are enemies and vaccines are strategic weapons against enemies.” Editor’s Note: This story was edited to clarify that most deaths after contracting the viral 1918 flu were attributed to a secondary bacterial pneumonia infection that would have been aided by antibiotics, which were not fully developed until the 1930s.

Bases coast to coast crowded with recruits let the virus hopscotch around the country. Every Army training camp reported infections.</p> <p>Cramped troop ships ferrying soldiers across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe to fight Germany and its allies became breeding grounds for infection. The battlefield trenches, where conditions were anything but sanitary, became hotbeds of disease. Cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever were common. Poor nutrition was rampant.</p> <p>Field hospitals up and down the Western Front became overwhelmed.</p> <p>In the fall of 1918, as the flu virus mounted its deadly second wave, the Army’s acting surgeon general, <a href="https://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwi/volisgo/Sec2Ch01.htm">Brig. Gen. Charles Richard</a>, pressed Army Chief of Staff General <a href="https://armyhistory.org/general-peyton-c-march/">Peyton March</a> to impose a quarantine on troops before they boarded ships bound for Europe and to reduce the crowding in hopes of checking the spread of infection. But March also felt pressure from <a href="https://www.history.comopics/world-war-i/john-j-pershing">Gen. John J. Pershing</a>, commander of the American Expeditionary Force, who wanted more men.</p> <p>In a conversation with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/woodrow-wilson/">President Woodrow Wilson</a>, March argued against a slowdown and Wilson agreed. The soldier who died from the virus, March said, <a href="https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/war_losses_usa">“has just as surely played his part as his comrade who has died in France.”</a></p> <p>Wilson himself later <a href="https://www.history.comews/woodrow-wilson-1918-pandemic-world-war-i">contracted the Spanish Flu</a> while in Paris for peace negotiations in 1919. Accounts at the time said the president was <a href="https://www.newyorker.comews/daily-comment/woodrow-wilsons-case-of-the-flu-and-how-pandemics-change-history">not the same after his illness</a>. Months later he <a href="https://www.pbs.orgewshour/health/woodrow-wilson-stroke">suffered a mini stroke</a>.</p> <p>Physicians identified <a href="https://www.nih.govews-eventsews-releases/bacterial-pneumonia-caused-most-deaths-1918-influenza-pandemic">the bacteria</a> causing many of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html">the deaths</a>. But without <a href="https://www.reactgroup.orgoolbox/understand/antibiotics/development-of-antibiotics-as-medicines/">antibiotics, which were not fully developed until the 1930s</a>, they “could do little more than provide palliative care of warmth, rest, and a gentle diet, and hope that their patients did not develop pneumonia,” <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2862337/">Byerly wrote in a report for NIH</a>.</p> <p>Military physicians experimented with several therapies to treat the bacteria. The U.S. Army Medical School produced and distributed two million doses of an experimental drug in October and November of 1918, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0095327X14567364">according to a 2015 article in Armed Forces &amp; Society</a>, which publishes peer-reviewed academic research.</p> <p>“The military environment was seen as an optimal setting in which to test the viability of an influenza vaccine, given the large number of test subjects (the enlisted), the controlled environment, large case numbers, and sophisticated reporting regimes,” wrote the authors, Christopher Watterson and Adam Kamradt-Scott.</p> <p>But because vaccines were still more an idea than a reality and the cause of the flu remained unknown, “no conclusive results ... could be attained. The net result from the failed trials meant that medical personnel often found themselves powerless to prevent the spread and lethality of the disease.”</p> <p>At Camp McClellan in Alabama, since renamed Fort McClellan, “Military authorities also attempted to prevent the spread of infection by keeping buildings clean, airing out tents and bedding daily, exposing troops to fresh air, and keeping recovering patients isolated for an additional ten days,” wrote Kathleen M. Fargey, a historian with the <a href="https://history.army.mil/">U.S. Army Center of Military History</a>, in the <a href="https://history.army.mil/covid19/AH111-article(Influenza-1918-1919).pdf">spring 2019 issue of Army History.</a> “Units which seemed prone to illness were sprayed with chemical agents in an attempt at decontamination.”</p> <p>But the rapid, unrelenting spread of the contagion became almost overwhelming.</p> <p>Dr. Victor Vaughn, dean of the University of Michigan School of Medicine at the time, was no stranger to the debilitating effect of disease, having seen how <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/fever-scourge-spanish-american-war/">typhoid fever laid soldiers low</a> during the Spanish-American War.</p> <p>As head of the communicable diseases section of the surgeon general’s office, he visited Camp Devens near Boston during the virus’s second wave in the fall of 1918.</p> <p>“I see hundreds of young, stalwart men in the uniform of their country coming into the wards of the hospital in groups of ten or more,” <a href="http://www.vaughan.org/bios/vcv/aDoctorsMemories.pdf">he wrote</a> afterward. “They are placed on the cots until every bed is full and yet others crowd in. The faces soon bore a bluish cast; a distressing cough brings up the blood-stained sputum. In the morning the dead bodies are stacked about the morgue like cordwood.”</p> <p>A <a href="https://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwi/1918flu/arsg1919/ARSG1919Extractsflu.htm#Cl.%20CAMP%20MEADE%20BASE%20HOSPITAL%20REPORT.">hospital report around that same time from Camp Meade</a><u>,</u> near Baltimore, noted the virus’s stunning infection rate.</p> <p>“The hospital, which was accustomed to admitting between 50 and 70 new cases daily, was suddenly admitting hundreds, as many as 875 being admitted in a single day (Sept. 28, 1918),” the report stated. “Instead of 900 to 1,000 patients to care for, the wards of the hospital were suddenly filled with 3,000.”</p> <p>Though the military didn’t have the tools that modern medicine has used to thwart the current pandemic, it understood that whether now or a century ago, a strong public health system with clear lines of leadership was crucial to the response.</p> <p>“That’s what the Army has been able to have,” Byerly says. “To see people say public health needs to be handled at the local level, that’s not the way the virus sees it. The Army understands that these germs are enemies and vaccines are strategic weapons against enemies.”</p> <p><em>Editor's Note: This story was edited to clarify that most deaths after contracting the viral 1918 flu were attributed to a secondary bacterial pneumonia infection that would have been aided by antibiotics, which were not fully developed until the 1930s. </em></p> <hr /> <p><em>This War Horse feature was reported by David Goldstein, edited by Kelly Kennedy, fact-checked by Ben Kalin, and copy-edited by Mitchell Hansen-Dewar. </em></p> Editors Note: This <a target="_blank" href="https:/hewarhorse.org/military-covid-vaccine-mandate-echoes-past-pandemic-lessons/">article</a> first appeared on <a target="_blank" href="https:/hewarhorse.org">The War Horse,</a> an award-winning nonprofit news organization educating the public on military service.

Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Email Coronavirus COVID-19, flu ‘twindemic’ threat worries doctors: ‘Get flu shot early’ Experts had issued a similar warning last summer, but the surge never came By Kayla Rivas Fox News Published August 26, 2021 1:15pm EDT Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for August 26 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Doctors are yet again warning over the threat of a possible "twindemic," or burdened hospitals amid converging respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 and influenza, prompting calls to receive flu shots early. Experts had issued a similar warning last summer amid soaring COVID-19 infections, citing worries over overwhelmed hospital systems by both COVID-19 and the influx of flu patients, but the surge never came. From October to mid-February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded 165-laboratory confirmed flu-related hospitalizations in the U.S., the lowest rate of flu-related hospitalizations since data collection began in 2005.However doctors' warnings have resurfaced, with experts citing social mixing and relaxed mitigation measures as the country approaches the colder seasons. CLICK HERE TO FIND A COVID-19 VACCINE NEAR YOU "This year, however, we are heading into the flu season with more relaxed restrictions and the situation will allow for increased chance of respiratory illness transmissions," Dr. TingTing Wong, internist and infectious disease specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian Medical Group Brooklyn, told Fox News. "We saw a similar uptick of 'summer colds' caused by other viruses (for example RSV, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhino viruses, etc.) this summer as restrictions relaxed and the fear is a similar uptick of flu cases this fall/winter season." "Bottom line, please get the flu vaccine early!" Wong added.National reports of RSV, a common respiratory virus, increased into July, nearly hitting highs not seen since late fall to winter of 2019, according to laboratory data submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). RSV infections typically occur during the fall, winter and spring, suggesting an unusual summertime uptick coinciding with rising cases of the delta variant. However, data indicates PCR detected RSV cases began to decline later into July, per the latest complete data. PEDIATRIC COVID-19 HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS HITTING RECORD HIGHS, CDC DATA SHOWSCOVID-19 cases are also increasing; at the latest White House COVID-19 response briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC director, noted that the seven-day average of new daily cases and deaths are increasing, with about 137,000 new cases per day, or a 12% rise from the prior seven-day period, and about 739 deaths per day, or a 23% increase over the prior week. The seven-day average for hospitalizations was similar to the prior week at around 11,000 per day. However, flu circulation remains low, added Dr. Ravina Kullar, infectious diseases specialist, epidemiologist and adjunct faculty at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. PFIZER REQUESTS FULL FDA APPROVAL OF COVID-19 BOOSTER SHOT"With COVID-19 infections surging in the United States, other respiratory pathogens have been unseasonally increasing as well, particularly RSV and parainfluenza. To date, we have not seen a high prevalence of flu cases. According to the CDC influenza surveillance, flu circulation remains low at around 2.1%, which is below the baseline of 2.6% nationally."Kullar warned the flu circulation rate "could change at any point" amid social mixing and relaxed mitigation measures, such as facemasks. "It is important to get your flu vaccine now," she stressed.Fox News' Alexandria Hein contributed to this report. Kayla Rivas is a Health reporter and joined Fox News in April 2020.

While you definitely want to make sure you take your health seriously, it is always possible you’re just dealing with a common cold. But how long does the common cold last before you suspect that it's Covid? Here’s how to identify if that’s what you’re dealing with.Symptoms of the common coldAccording to Soma Mandal, MD, a board-certified internist at Summit Medical Group in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, the first one to two days of the common cold (AKA a viral upper respiratory infection) typically start off with the following symptoms: nasal congestionrunny nosesore throatAfter that, the next three to five days of your common cold usually consists of coughing and more nasal congestion. "Coughing may occur due to postnasal drip, so drinking plenty of fluids and decongestants can help ease symptoms," she explains.Since Covid-19 has many similar symptoms to a common cold, (such as a cough and sore throat) and can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after infection, the CDC recommends getting tested as a precaution. Men's HealthHow long a common cold should lastWhen you’re sick with one, chances are you view it as "just a cold," even as mild symptoms show up as a nuisance for what seems like a never-ending few days. According to Dr. Mandal, this is normal, since a common cold should last about seven to 10 days. "But be aware, it can sometimes take up to six weeks for a post nasal drip to fully resolve, so even if the viral cold is over, post nasal drip can continue in the body's repair process of damaged tissues from the virus," she explains. What to do if your cold lasts longer than 10 daysIf your symptoms persist beyond that typical seven to 10-day lifespan, we don’t blame you for feeling concerned, as cold symptoms sometimes seem to be almost identical to more serious conditions.“Sometimes, a common cold can also turn into a sinus infection, so if after a week, you are noting worsening sinus pressure, yellowish/greenish nasal discharge, fatigue or fever, then consulting with a medical professional is best advised,” Dr. Mandal adds. “If, after a week or so, you are experiencing fever, difficulty breathing, or chest pressure, then making sure to get evaluated for possible pneumonia is also important.” Cold symptoms are also not too different from those of the flu and Covid-19, and while it may end up being “just a cold,” with the ongoing pandemic, now’s not the time to mess around — if you think you’ve been exposed to someone who’s infected, get tested ASAP, and schedule yourself to get vaccinated if you haven’t already done so.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowHealthOne Man’s Fight Against His Diabetes DestinyTherapy Helped This Grammy-Winning Trio Level UpSo, Is the MAHA Movement BS or What? 8 Best Muscle Pain Relief CreamsAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhat a 'Normal' Resting Heart Rate Should BeRyan Lennon Is the 2024 Ultimate Guy WinnerAaron Sanchez Is a 2024 Ultimate Guy FinalistHassan Paige Is a 2024 Ultimate Guy FinalistThe 2024 Ultimate Men’s Health Guy SemifinalistsUltimate Men's Health Guy: 10th AnniversaryIs Your Semen Volume Normal?7 Surprising Benefits of Mastic GumAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowAbout Men's HealthNewsletterCustomer CareE-prints, ReprintsAdvertiseSubscribeGive a GiftManage Email PreferencesOther Hearst SubscriptionsMedia KitA Part of Hearst Digital MediaWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.©2024 Hearst Magazines, Inc.
