1. The study investigates an intranasal influenza-vectored COVID-19 vaccine that restrains the SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory response in hamsters.
2. The vaccine induces innate immunity, trained immunity, and tissue-resident memory T cells in the upper and lower respiratory tract.
3. It suppresses viral load and reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, leading to less immune-induced tissue injury.
4. The vaccine is a potential broad-spectrum COVID-19 vaccine strategy to reduce disease burden.
5. Intranasal delivery of the vaccine induces local cellular immunity and trained immunity.
6. The study highlights the importance of developing vaccines that provide respiratory tract protection and can combat SARS-CoV-2 variants.
